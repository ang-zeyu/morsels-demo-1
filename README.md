# morsels-demo-1

Demo site for Morsels, showcasing a **500MB** pure text collection.

## Source

The collection used is a subcorpus of the gutenberg Collection, obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/mateibejan/15000-gutenberg-books.

Since even this subcollection totals to `3.7GB` unpacked, a further subcorpus of this collection is taken (~first 1/5 of books)

To generate a realistic amount of documents, books are further split into `10KB` chunks, totalling about **52003** documents.
