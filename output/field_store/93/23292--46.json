In 1868 they published an eloquent declaration, written by Rieger,  declaring that they would never recognise dualism and emphasising Bohemia's  right to independence. When Francis Joseph visited Prague in the same year,  people left the city in crowds, anti-Austrian demonstrations were held  throughout the country, and flowers were laid on the spot where prominent  members of the Bohemian nobility had been executed by the Austrians  in 1621.    Vienna answered by fierce reprisals. Baron Koller was sent to Prague where  a state of siege was proclaimed. Czech papers were suppressed, and their  editors imprisoned. This only strengthened Czech opposition. The passive  policy of the Old Czechs gained popularity and the Czechs did not even  attend the Bohemian Diet. Finally, when the Franco-Prussian War was  imminent, the dynasty was forced to yield, and Potocki began to negotiate  with the Czechs.    Meanwhile the Czechs again entered the Bohemian Diet on the day of the  battle of Sedan, August 30, 1870, and issued a declaration of rights with  which also the Bohemian nobility for the first time publicly identified  themselves. On December 8, 1870, the Czechs (without the nobility)  presented the Imperial Chancellor, Beust, with a memorandum on Austrian  foreign policy, declaring their sympathy with France and Russia and  protesting against the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and against an  alliance of Austria with Germany.    In February, 1871, Hohenwart was appointed Minister President with the  object of conciliating the Czechs, and Francis Joseph addressed to them an  imperial proclamation, called the \"September Rescript,\" in which he  declared:--        \"Remembering the constitutional ('Staatsrechtliche') position of the      Crown of Bohemia and the glory and power which the same has lent to Us      and Our ancestors, remembering further the unswerving loyalty with      which the population of Bohemia at all times supported Our throne, We      gladly recognise the rights of this Kingdom and We are ready to      acknowledge this recognition by Our solemn Royal Oath.\"    It is well known, of course, that Francis Joseph did not keep his word and  was never crowned King of Bohemia.    6. In answer to the rescript, the Czechs formulated their demands in the  so-called \"fundamental articles,\" the main point of which was that the  Bohemian Diet should directly elect deputies to the delegations. The  _Narodni Listy_ declared that the \"fundamental articles\" meant minimum  demands, and that the Czechs would in any case work \"for the attainment of  an independent Czecho-Slovak state, as desired by the whole nation.\"    At this stage Berlin and Budapest intervened. The emperor yielded to the  advice of William I. and Andrassy, and signed an unfavourable reply to the  Czech address on October 30, 1871. Czech opposition was now openly directed  against the dynasty. Hohenwart resigned on October 27. In November, Baron  Koller was again appointed Governor of Bohemia and repressive methods of  administration were once more introduced.    In 1873 elections were held, marked by violence and corruption.  Notwithstanding the passive resistance of Czech deputies, the parliament  continued to meet in Vienna. In 1878 Austria occupied Bosnia and thus  inaugurated the conquest of the Balkans for Germany. In 1879 Count Taaffe  at last induced the Czechs to abandon their policy of \"passive resistance\"  and to enter the parliament in return for some administrative and other  concessions, including a Czech university. On September 9, the Czechs,  united in a party of fifty-two members, entered the Reichsrat to maintain  their protest against the dual system.    7. In parliament it became clear that the Old Czech Party, now led by  Rieger, was inclined to be too conservative and too opportunist. In 1887  the Young Czechs left the national party and entered into opposition. Their  party grew steadily, and during the elections in 1889 gained a decided  victory in the country districts. The Old Czechs finally sealed their fate  when, in 1890, they concluded an unfavourable agreement with the Germans,  called the _punctations_, to the detriment of Czech interests and of the  integrity of Bohemia. This roused popular indignation throughout Bohemia  and brought about the complete collapse of the Old Czech Party.    At the same time the so-called _\"Realist\" movement_ originated in Bohemia,  led by Professor Masaryk, Professor Kaizl and Dr. Kramar. It was not a  separate party movement, but a philosophic effort for a regenerated  democratic national policy. The Realists demanded a practical, forward  movement, such as would at last secure independence for the Czechs. In 1890  the Realists published their programme and joined the Young Czechs. This  meant the end of the political career of Rieger and the Old Czechs.    8. In parliament the Young Czechs inaugurated a radical anti-German policy.  In 1891 they openly attacked the Triple Alliance, and in 1892 Dr. Menger  called Masaryk a traitor for his outspoken defence of the right of Bohemia  to independence.    A _Radical movement_ was also started at this time in Bohemia, mainly by  students and advanced workers of the Young Czech Party, which called itself  \"Omladina\" (Czech word for \"youth\"). Its object was to rouse the young  generation against Austria. In 1893 anti-dynastic demonstrations were  organised by the \"Omladina.\" A state of siege was proclaimed in Prague and  seventy-seven members of this \"secret society\" were arrested; sixty-eight  of them, including Dr. Rasin, were condemned for high treason, and  sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.    In 1893 Professor Masaryk, realising the futility of his efforts against  the encroachments of Germanism, resigned his mandate and devoted his  energies to scientific and philosophical work. In 1900, however, he founded  a party of his own, with a progressive democratic programme.    In the elections to the Bohemian Diet in 1895, the Young Czechs gained  eighty-nine seats out of ninety-five; in the Moravian Diet seventeen seats  were held by the _People's Party_, corresponding to the Young Czech Party  in Bohemia, thirteen by the Old Czechs and five by the Clericals. In 1896  Badeni made an attempt at enfranchising the masses; seventy-two additional  deputies were to be elected by universal suffrage. In these elections the  Young Czechs again won in Bohemia. In Moravia the People's Party concluded  a compromise with the Old Czechs and gained fifteen seats, the Socialists  gained three seats and the Clericals one. On entering the parliament the  Czechs again made a declaration of state right. In 1897 Badeni, a Pole,  issued his famous Language Ordinances, asserting the equality of the Czech  and German languages in Bohemia and Moravia. The Germans raised a fierce  opposition, supported by the Socialists, and the Reichsrat became the scene  of violent attempts on the part of the Germans to obstruct sittings by  throwing inkstands at the leader of the House and using whistles and bugles  to make all proceedings impossible. Badeni lost his head and resigned, and  his decrees were rescinded. The dynasty, afraid of a repetition of German  obstruction, gave the Germans a completely free hand in all matters of  government.    9. Owing to the rapid cultural, economic and industrial development of  Bohemia, the Czech party system began to expand. The _Czecho-Slav Social  Democratic Party_, founded in 1878, began to acquire increasing influence.  At first it was based on purely international socialism, and in 1897 it  even opposed the national Czech demands. Later, seeing the duplicity of  their German comrades who recognised the state right of Finland and  Hungary, but not that of Bohemia, and who openly preached the necessity of  assimilating the Slavs, the Czech Socialists began to identify themselves  more and more with the national struggle for independence. They organised  their own trade unions, which brought them into open conflict with the  Austrian Socialists. This question was discussed at the Socialist  International Conference at Copenhagen in 1910. It is, moreover, on account  of these differences on nationality questions that the various Socialist  parties of Austria have not met since 1905.    In April, 1898, the _Czech National Social Party_, led by Klofac, was  formed in opposition to the Socialists. It was radically nationalist, and  consisted mainly of workmen, as it was evolved from the workers'  organisation in the Young Czech Party.    On January 6, 1899, the _Agrarian Party_ was formed. It was chiefly  composed of farmers and peasants. It defended the interests of their class  and acquired considerable influence among them. In national matters it  subscribed to the programme of Bohemian independence, and its organs have  during the present war adopted a courageous anti-Austrian attitude.    In 1900 the so-called _State Right Party_ was founded by some of the  members of the former \"Omladina.\" It had a radical programme and stood  uncompromisingly against Austria, demanding independence for Bohemia  chiefly on the ground of her historic rights.    In the elections of 1901 the United Czech Club gained fifty-three seats,  the National Socialists four and the Agrarians five. But the real influence  of the various new parties began to appear only in 1907, after the  introduction of the universal suffrage which deprived the Young Czechs of  their predominance. The Reichsrat elected in 1907 consisted of 257 non-Slav  and 259 Slav members, of whom 108 were Czechs. The result of the election  in Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia was as follows:--    28 Agrarians  24 Social Democrats  23 Young Czechs  17 National Catholics  9  Radicals  4  Moravian People's Party  2  Realists  1  Independent Candidate.    This result showed that the Young Czechs, owing to their deficient  organisation, had lost ground, especially among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#7)"],[1," there is no argument of this kind, must appear, if our explication of  that species of reasoning be admitted as solid and satisfactory. We have  said that all arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation  of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation is derived  entirely from experience; and that all our experimental conclusions  proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the  past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this last supposition by  probable arguments, or arguments regarding existence, must be evidently  going in a circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very point  in question.    31. In reality, all arguments from experience are founded on the  similarity which we discover among natural objects, and by which we are  induced to expect effects similar to those which we have found to follow  from such objects. And though none but a fool or madman will ever  pretend to dispute the authority of experience, or to reject that great  guide of human life, it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so  much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature,  which gives this mighty authority to experience, and makes us draw  advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among different  objects. From causes which appear _similar_ we expect similar effects.  This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions. Now it seems  evident that, if this conclusion were formed by reason, it would be as  perfect at first, and upon one instance, as after ever so long a course  of experience. But the case is far otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs;  yet no one, on account of this appearing similarity, expects the same  taste and relish in all of them. It is only after a long course of  uniform experiments in any kind, that we attain a firm reliance and  security with regard to a particular event. Now where is that process of  reasoning which, from one instance, draws a conclusion, so different  from that which it infers from a hundred instances that are nowise  different from that single one? This question I propose as much for the  sake of information, as with an intention of raising difficulties. I  cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I keep my mind  still open to instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me.    32. Should it be said that, from a number of uniform experiments, we  _infer_ a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret  powers; this, I must confess, seems the same difficulty, couched in  different terms. The question still recurs, on what process of argument  this _inference_ is founded? Where is the medium, the interposing ideas,  which join propositions so very wide of each other? It is confessed that  the colour, consistence, and other sensible qualities of bread appear  not, of themselves, to have any connexion with the secret powers of  nourishment and support. For otherwise we could infer these secret  powers from the first appearance of these sensible qualities, without  the aid of experience; contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers,  and contrary to plain matter of fact. Here, then, is our natural state  of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence of all objects. How  is this remedied by experience? It only shows us a number of uniform  effects, resulting from certain objects, and teaches us that those  particular objects, at that particular time, were endowed with such  powers and forces. When a new object, endowed with similar sensible  qualities, is produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look  for a like effect. From a body of like colour and consistence with bread  we expect like nourishment and support. But this surely is a step or  progress of the mind, which wants to be explained. When a man says, _I  have found, in all past instances, such sensible qualities conjoined  with such secret powers_: And when he says, _Similar sensible qualities  will always be conjoined with similar secret powers_, he is not guilty  of a tautology, nor are these propositions in any respect the same. You  say that the one proposition is an inference from the other. But you  must confess that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it  demonstrative: Of what nature is it, then? To say it is experimental, is  begging the question. For all inferences from experience suppose, as  their foundation, that the future will resemble the past, and that  similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities. If  there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change, and that  the past may be no rule for the future, all experience becomes useless,  and can give rise to no inference or conclusion. It is impossible,  therefore, that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance  of the past to the future; since all these arguments are founded on the  supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of things be allowed  hitherto ever so regular; that alone, without some new argument or  inference, proves not that, for the future, it will continue so. In vain  do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your past  experience. Their secret nature, and consequently all their effects and  influence, may change, without any change in their sensible qualities.  This happens sometimes, and with regard to some objects: Why may it not  happen always, and with regard to all objects? What logic, what process  of argument secures you against this supposition? My practice, you say,  refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question. As an  agent, I am quite satisfied in the point; but as a philosopher, who has  some share of curiosity, I will not say scepticism, I want to learn the  foundation of this inference. No reading, no enquiry has yet been able  to remove my difficulty, or give me satisfaction in a matter of such  importance. Can I do better than propose the difficulty to the public,  even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of obtaining a solution? We  shall at least, by this means, be sensible of our ignorance, if we do  not augment our knowledge.    33. I must confess that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance who  concludes, because an argument has escaped his own investigation, that  therefore it does not really exist. I must also confess that, though all  the learned, for several ages, should have employed themselves in  fruitless search upon any subject, it may still, perhaps, be rash to  conclude positively that the subject must, therefore, pass all human  comprehension. Even though we examine all the sources of our knowledge,  and conclude them unfit for such a subject, there may still remain a  suspicion, that the enumeration is not complete, or the examination not  accurate. But with regard to the present subject, there are some  considerations which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or  suspicion of mistake.    It is certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants--nay infants,  nay even brute beasts--improve by experience, and learn the qualities of  natural objects, by observing the effects which result from them. When a  child has felt the sensation of pain from touching the flame of a  candle, he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle; but will  expect a similar effect from a cause which is similar in its sensible  qualities and appearance. If you assert, therefore, that the  understanding of the child is led into this conclusion by any process of  argument or ratiocination, I may justly require you to produce that  argument; nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand. You  cannot say that the argument is abstruse, and may possibly escape your  enquiry; since you confess that it is obvious to the capacity of a mere  infant. If you hesitate, therefore, a moment, or if, after reflection,  you produce any intricate or profound argument, you, in a manner, give  up the question, and confess that it is not reasoning which engages us  to suppose the past resembling the future, and to expect similar effects  from causes which are, to appearance, similar. This is the proposition  which I intended to enforce in the present section. If I be right, I  pretend not to have made any mighty discovery. And if I be wrong, I must  acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar; since I cannot  now discover an argument which, it seems, was perfectly familiar to me  long before I was out of my cradle.        SECTION V.    SCEPTICAL SOLUTION OF THESE DOUBTS.      PART I.      34. The passion for philosophy, like that for religion, seems liable to  this inconvenience, that, though it aims at the correction of our  manners, and extirpation of our vices, it may only serve, by imprudent  management, to foster a predominant inclination, and push the mind, with  more determined resolution, towards that side which already _draws_ too  much, by the bias and propensity of the natural temper. It is certain  that, while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic  sage, and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own  minds, we may, at last, render our philosophy like that of Epictetus,  and other _Stoics_, only a more refined system of selfishness, and  reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment. While we  study with attention the vanity of human life, and turn all our thoughts  towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours, we are,  perhaps, all the while flattering our natural indolence, which, hating  the bustle of the world, and drudgery of business, seeks a pretence of  reason to give itself a full and uncontrolled indulgence. There is,  however, one species of philosophy which seems little liable to this  inconvenience, and that because it strikes in with no disorderly passion  of the human mind, nor can mingle itself with any natural affection or  propensity; and that is the Academic or Sceptical"]]]
