Pythagoras made  great efforts and sacrifices to be initiated in their higher mysteries;  but these, it is thought, were withheld, since he was a foreigner. What  he did learn, however, formed a foundation of what is most valuable in  Grecian philosophy. Herodotus declares that he knew the mysteries, but  should not divulge them. Moses was skilled in all the knowledge of the  sacred schools of Egypt, and perhaps incorporated in his jurisprudence  some of its most valued truths. Possibly Plato obtained from the  Egyptian priests his idea of the immortality of the soul, since this was  one of their doctrines. It is even thought by Wilkinson that they  believed in the unity, the eternal existence, and invisible power of  God, but there is no definite knowledge on that point. Ammon, the  concealed god, seems to have corresponded with the Zeus of the Greeks,  as Sovereign Lord of Heaven. The priests certainly taught a state of  future rewards and punishments, for the great doctrine of metempsychosis  is based upon it,--the transmission of the soul after death into the  bodies of various animals as an expiation for sin. But however lofty  were the esoteric doctrines which the more learned of the initiated  believed, they were carefully concealed from the people, who were deemed  too ignorant to understand them; and hence the immense difference  between the priests and people, and the universal prevalence of  degrading superstitions and the vile polytheism which everywhere  existed,--even the worship of the powers of Nature in those animals  which were held sacred. Among all the ancient nations, however  complicated were their theogonies, and however degraded the forms of  worship assumed,--of men, or animals, or plants,--it was heat or light  (the sun as the visible promoter of blessings) which was regarded as the  _animus mundi_, to be worshipped as the highest manifestation of divine  power and goodness. The sun, among all the ancient polytheists, was  worshipped under various names, and was one of the supremest deities.  The priestly city of On, a sort of university town, was consecrated to  the worship of Ra, the sun. Baal was the sun-god among the polytheistic  Canaanites, as Bel was among the Assyrians.    The Egyptian Pantheon, except perhaps that of Rome, was the most  extensive among the ancient nations, and the most degraded, although  that people were the most religious as well as superstitious of ancient  pagans. The worship of the Deity, in some form, was as devout as it was  universal, however degrading were the rites; and no expense was spared  in sacrifices to propitiate the favor of the peculiar deity who presided  over each of the various cities, for almost every city had a different  deity. Notwithstanding the degrading fetichism--the lowest kind of  Nature-worship, including the worship of animals--which formed the basis  of the Egyptian religion, there were traces in it of pure monotheism, as  in that of Babylonia and of ancient India. The distinguishing  peculiarity of the Egyptian religion was the adoration of sacred  animals as emblems of the gods, the chief of which were the bull, the  cat, and the beetle.    The gods of the Egyptian Pantheon were almost innumerable, since they  represented every form and power of Nature, and all the passions which  move the human soul; but the most remarkable of the popular deities was  Osiris, who was regarded as the personification of good. Isis, the  consort of Osiris, who with him presided at the judgment of the dead,  was scarcely less venerated. Set, or Typhon, the brother of Osiris, was  the personification of evil. Between Osiris and Set, therefore, was  perpetual antagonism. This belief, divested of names and titles and  technicalities and fables, seems to have resembled, in this respect, the  religion of the Persians,--the eternal conflict between good and evil.  The esoteric doctrines of the priests initiated into the higher  mysteries probably were the primeval truths, too abstract for the  ignorant and sensual people to comprehend, and which were represented to  them in visible forms that appealed to their senses, and which they  worshipped with degrading rites.    The oldest of all the rites of the ancient pagans was in the form of  sacrifice, to propitiate the deity. Abraham and Jacob offered  sacrifices, but without degrading ceremonies, and both abhorred the  representation of the deity in the form of animals; but there was  scarcely an animal or reptile in Egypt that the people did not hold  sacred, in fear or reverence. Moral evil was represented by the serpent,  showing that something was retained, though in a distorted form, of the  primitive revelation. The most celebrated forms of animal worship were  the bulls at Memphis, sacred to Osiris, or, as some think, to the sun;  the cat to Phtha, and the beetle to Re. The origin of these  superstitions cannot be traced; they are shrouded in impenetrable  mystery. All that we know is that they existed from the remotest period  of which we have cognizance, long before the pyramids were built.    In spite, however, of the despotism of the kings, the privileges of the  priests, and the degrading superstitions of the people, which introduced  the most revolting form of religious worship ever seen on earth, there  was in Egypt a high civilization in comparison with that of other  nations, dating back to a mythical period. More than two thousand years  before the Christian era, and six hundred before letters were introduced  into Greece, one thousand years before the Trojan War, twelve hundred  years before Buddha, and fifteen hundred years before Rome was founded,  great architectural works existed in Egypt, the remains of which still  astonish travellers for their vastness and grandeur. In the time of  Joseph, before the eighteenth dynasty, there was in Egypt an estimated  population of seven millions, with twenty thousand cities. The  civilization of that country four thousand years ago was as high as that  of the Chinese of the present day; and their literary and scientific  accomplishments, their proficiency in the industrial and fine arts,  remain to-day the wonder of history. But one thing is very  remarkable,--that while there seems to have been no great progress for  two thousand years, there was not any marked decline, thus indicating  virtuous habits of life among the great body of the people from  generation to generation. They were preserved from degeneracy by their  simple habits and peaceful pursuits. Though the armies of the King  numbered four hundred thousand men, there were comparatively few wars,  and these mostly of a defensive character.    Such was the Egypt which Joseph governed with signal ability for more  than half a century, nearly four thousand years ago,--the mother of  inventions, the pioneer in literature and science, the home of learned  men, the teacher of nations, communicating a knowledge which was never  lost, making the first great stride in the civilization of the world. No  one knows whether this civilization was indigenous, or derived from  unknown races, or the remains of a primitive revelation, since it cannot  be traced beyond Egypt itself, whose early inhabitants were more Asiatic  than African, and apparently allied with Phoenicians and Assyrians,    But the civilization of Egypt is too extensive a subject to be entered  upon in this connection. I hope to treat it more at length in subsequent  volumes. I can only say now that in some things the Egyptians were never  surpassed. Their architecture, as seen in the pyramids and the ruins of  temples, was marvellous; while their industrial arts would not be  disdained even in the 19th century.    Over this fertile, favored, and civilized nation Joseph reigned,--with  delegated power indeed, but with power that was absolute,--when his  starving brothers came to Egypt to buy corn, for the famine extended  probably over western Asia. He is to be viewed, not as a prophet, or  preacher, or reformer, or even a warrior like Moses, but as a merely  executive ruler. As the son-in-law of the high-priest of Hieropolis, and  delegated governor of the land, in the highest favor with the King, and  himself a priest, it is probable that Joseph was initiated into the  esoteric wisdom of the priesthood. He was undoubtedly stern, resolute,  and inflexible in his relations with men, as great executive chieftains  necessarily must be, whatever their private sympathies and friendships.  To all appearance he was a born Egyptian, as he spoke the language of  Egypt, had adopted its habits, and was clothed with the insignia of  Egyptian power.    So that when the sons of Jacob, who during the years of famine in  Canaan had come down to Egypt to buy corn, were ushered into his  presence, and bowed down to him, as had been predicted, he was harsh to  them, although at once recognizing them. \"Whence come ye?\" he said  roughly to them. They replied, \"From the land of Canaan to buy corn,\"  \"Nay,\" continued he, \"ye are spies.\" \"Not so, my lord, but to buy food  are thy servants come. We are all one man's sons; we are true men; thy  servants are not spies.\" \"Nay,\" he said, \"to see the nakedness of the  land are ye come,\"--for famine also prevailed in Egypt, and its governor  naturally would not wish its weakness to be known, for fear of a hostile  invasion. They replied, \"Thy servants are twelve brothers, the sons of  one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is this day with our father,  and one is not.\" But Joseph still persisted that they were spies, and  put them in prison for three days; after which he demanded as the  condition of their release that the younger brother should also appear  before him. \"If ye be true men,\" said he, \"let one of your brothers be  bound in the house of your prison, while you carry corn for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#8)"],[1,"congregational. In some places of worship it  is considered somewhat vulgar for members of the congregation to  give specimens of their vocalisation; and you can only find in out-  of-the-way side and back pews odd persons warbling a mild falsetto,  or piping an eccentric tenor, or doing a heavy bass on their own  responsibility; but at Lune-street Chapel the general members of the  congregation go into the work with a distinct determination to  either sing or make a righteous noise worthy of the occasion. They  are neither afraid nor ashamed of the job; and we hope they draw  consolation from it. The more genteel worshippers take up their  quarters mainly on the ground floor--at the back of the central  seats and at the sides. The poor have resting places found for them  immediately in front of the pulpit and at the rear of the galleries.  Very little of that unctuous spasmodic shouting, which used to  characterise Wesleyanism, is heard in Lune-street Chapel. It has  become unfashionable to bellow; it is not considered \"the thing\" to  ride the high horse of vehement approval and burst into luminous  showers of \"Amens\" and \"Halleleujahs.\" Now and then a few  worshippers of the ancient type drop in from some country place, and  explode at intervals during the course of some impulsive prayer, or  gleeful hymn, or highly enamelled sermon. You may occasionally at  such a time, hear two or three in distant pews having a delightful  time of it. At first they only stir gently, as if some on were  mildly pinching or tickling them. Gradually they become more  audible, and as the fire of their zeal warms up, and the eloquence  of the minister enflames, they get keener, fiercer, more rapturous;  the intervals of repose are shorter, the moments of ecstacy are more  rapid and fervent; and this goes on with gathering desperation,  until the speaker reaches his--climax, and stops to either breathe  or use his handkerchief. But hardy a scintilla of this is perceived  on ordinary occasions; indeed it has become so unpopular that an  exhibition of it seems to quietly amuse--to evoke mild smiles and  dubious glances--rather than meet with reciprocity of approval. It  must be some great man in the region of Wesleyanism; some grand,  tearing, pathetic, eloquent preacher who can stir to a point of  moderate audibility the voices of the multitude of worshippers. In  Lune-street Chapel, the Ten Commandments occupy a prominent  position, and that is a good thing. It would be well if they were  fastened up in every place of worship, and better still if the  parsons referred to them more frequently.    Respecting the ministers of the chapel in question, we way say that  there are three. None of them can stay less than one, nor more than  three, years. It is a question of \"Hey, presto--quick change,\" every  third year. The names of the triumvirate at Lune-street are, the  Rev. W. Mearns, M.A., who is the superintendent; the Rev. W. H.  Tindall, second in command; and the Rev. F. B. Swift, the general  clerical servant of all work. Mr. Mearns is a calm, rather bilious-  looking, elderly man. There is nothing bewitching in his appearance;  he looks like what he is--a quietly-disposed, evenly-tempered,  Methodist minister. He is neither fussy, nor conceited, nor fond of  brandishing the sword of superiority. He goes about his work  steadily, and is as patient in harness as out of it. He has northern  blood in his veins which checks impulsiveness and everything  approaching that solemn ferocity sometimes displayed in Methodist  pulpits. There is nothing oratorical in his style of delivery; it is  calm, slow, and has a rather soporific influence upon his hearers.  There is more practical than argumentative matter in his sermons;  but, in the aggregate, they are hard and dry--lack lustre and  passion; and this, combined with his stoical manner of delivery, has  a chilling, rather than an attractive, influence. He always speaks  in harmony with the rules of grammar. His sentences, although  uttered extemporaneously, are invariably well finished and  scholarly. His words are well chosen; they are fit in with  cultivated exactitude and polished precision. They will stand  reading; nay, they will read excellently--infinitely better than the  burning rhapsody of more phrensied and eloquent men; but they fall  with a long-drawn dulness upon the ear when first uttered, and  don't, as Sam Slick would say, \"get up one's steam anyhow.\" Mr.  Mearns has a clear head and a good heart, but his spoken words want  power and immediate brightness, and his style is deadened for the  want of a little enthusiasm.    The Rev. Mr. Tindall comes up in a more polished, energetic, and  fashionable garb. He is eloquent, argumentative, polemical. His  literary capacity is good, and it has been well trained. He has read  much and studied keenly. His sermons are well thought out; he has  copious notes of them; and when he enters the pulpit they are made  complete for action--are fully equipped in their Sunday clothes and  ready for duty. His delivery is good; but physical weakness deprives  it of potency; and his contempt of the clock before him renders  people now and then uneasy. His manner is refined; his matter is  select; but there is something in both at times which you don't  altogether believe in digesting. A rather haughty, dictatorial ring  is sometimes noticed in them.  A large notion of the importance of  the preacher occasionally peeps up. He has a perfect right to  venerate Mr. Tindall, and if he is a little fashionable, what of  that?--isn't it fashionable to be fashionable? Only this may be  carried a little too far, even in men for whom pulpits are made and  circuits formed, and it is not always safe to let organ \"15\" in  phrenological charts get the upper hand. After all we admire Mr.  Tindall's erudition and eloquence. He is free from vulgarity, and in  general style miles ahead of many preachers in the same body, whose  great mission is to maltreat pulpits and turn religion into a  rhapsody of words.    The well-meaning and plodding Mr. Smith succeeds. He is a hard  worker; but there does not appear to be over much in him at present.  More thinking, and a greater experience of life, may cause him to  germinate agreeably in a few years. His style is stereotyped and  copied; there is a lack of original force in him; when he talks you  know what's coming next--you can tell five minutes off what he is  going to say, and that rather spoils the sensation of newness and  surprise which one likes to experience when parsons are either  pleasing or terrifying sinners. But Mr. Swift does his best, and,  according to Ebenezer Elliot, he does well who does that. It would  be wrong to deal harshly with a new beginner, and therefore we have  decided to check our criticism--to be brief--with Mr. Swift and  express a hope that in time he will be president of the Conference.        No. V.        FISHERGATE BAPTIST CHAPEL.        The \"right thing\" in regard to baptism is a recondite point; but we  are not going to enter into any controversy about it. We shall say  nothing as to the defects or merits of aspersion or sprinkling,  immersion or dipping, affusion or pouring. Opinions vary respecting  each system; and one may fairly say that the words uttered in  explanation of the general theme come literally to us in the \"voice  of many waters.\", Jacob the patriarch was the first Baptist; the  Jews kept up the rite moderately, but had more faith in its  abstergent than spiritual influence; John turned it into an  institution of Christianity; the Primitive Church carried on the  business slowly, Turtullian kicking against and Cyprian lauding it;  in the fifth century baptism became fully established amongst all  Christian communities; then the Eastern and Western Churches  quarrelled as to whether sprinkling or immersion constituted the  proper ceremony; other small disputes concerning the modus operandi  followed; and from that time to this the adherents of each scheme  have spilled a great deal of water in piously working out their  notions. There was once a time when nobody could undergo the  ordinary process of baptism except at Easter or Whitsuntide; but  children and upgrown people can now be put through the ceremony  whenever it is considered necessary. In Preston, as elsewhere, the  majority of people think well of water when it is required by  children for engulphing or baptismal purposes; but they care little  for its use when the teens have been trotted through. It may be  right enough for the physical and religious comfort of babes and  sucklings; but its virtues recede in the ratio of development. There  are, however, some sections of men and women in the town who,  symbolically at least, have a high regard for water at any time  after the years of sense and reason have been reached.    These are the Baptists. There are four or five chapels set apart for  their improvement in Preston, and the smartest of these is in  Fishergate. In Leeming-street it was in the chrysalis state; in  Fishergate the butterfly epoch has been reached. A dull, forlorn  looking edifice, afterwards taken advantage of by the Episcopalian  party, and now cleared off to make way for St. Saviour's church,  once formed the sacred asylum of a portion of the Baptists; but a  desire for better accomodation, combined with a wish for more  fashionable quarters, induced a change. The dove was repeatedly sent  out, and dry land was finally found for the Baptists in Fishergate.  In 1858 a chapel was erected upon the spot, and thus far it has  steadfastly maintained its position. It is a handsome building,  creditable to both the architect and the congregation, and if its  tower were less top heavy, it would, in its way, be quite superb. We  never look at that solemn tower head without being reminded of some  immense quadrangular pepper castor, fit for a place in the kitchen  of the Titans."]]]
