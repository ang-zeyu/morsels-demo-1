The king  immediately sent Wolsey to meet the emperor, who disembarked at Dover,  whither Henry went to visit him; and the two sovereigns repaired together  to Canterbury, where they went in state to the cathedral, \"resplendent,\"  says Erasmus, \"with all the precious gifts it had received for so many  centuries, especially with the most precious of all, the chest containing  the remains of Thomas a-Becket, so magnificent that gold was the least of  its ornaments.\"  There they passed three days, treating of their affairs  in the midst of galas, during which Charles V. completely won over Wolsey  by promising to help him to become pope.  On the 31st of May, 1520,  Charles, quite easy about the interview in France, embarked at Sandwich  for his Flemish possessions, and Henry VIII. made sail for Calais, his  point of departure to the place agreed upon for Francis to meet him, and  where they had made up their minds, both of them, to display all the  splendors of their two courts.    This meeting has remained celebrated in history far more for its royal  pomp, and for the personal incidents which were connected with it, than  for its political results.  It was called _The Field of Cloth of Gold;_  and the courtiers who attended the two sovereigns felt bound to almost  rival them in sumptuousness, \"insomuch,\" says the contemporary Martin du  Bellay, \"that many bore thither their mills, their forests, and their  meadows on their backs.\"  Henry VIII. had employed eleven hundred  workmen, the most skilful of Flanders and Holland, in building a  quadrangular palace of wood, one hundred and twenty-eight feet long every  way; on one side of the entrance-gate was a fountain, covered with  gilding, and surmounted by a statue of Bacchus, round which there flowed  through subterranean pipes all sorts of wines, and which bore in letters  of gold the inscription, \"Make good cheer, who will;\" and on the other  side a column, supported by four lions, was surmounted by a statue of  Cupid armed with bow and arrows.  Opposite the palace was erected a huge  figure of a savage wearing the arms of his race, with this inscription,  chosen by Henry VIII.: \"He whom I back wins.\"  The frontage was covered  outside with canvas painted to represent freestone; and the inside was  hung with rich tapestries.  Francis I., emulous of equalling his royal  neighbor in magnificence, had ordered to be erected close to Ardres an  immense tent, upheld in the middle by a colossal pole firmly fixed in the  ground and with pegs and cordage all around it.  Outside, the tent, in  the shape of a dome, was covered with cloth of gold; and, inside, it  represented a sphere with a ground of blue velvet and studded with stars,  like the firmament.  At each angle of the large tent there was a small  one equally richly decorated.  But before the two sovereigns exchanged  visits, in the midst of all these magnificent preparations, there arose  a violent hurricane, which tore up the pegs and split the cordage of the  French tent, scattered them over the ground, and forced Francis I. to  take up his quarters in an old castle near Ardres.  When the two kings'  two chief councillors, Cardinal Wolsey on one side and Admiral Bonnivet  on the other, had regulated the formalities, on the 7th of June, 1520,  Francis I. and Henry VIII. set out on their way, at the same hour and the  same pace, for their meeting in the valley of Ardres, where a tent had  been prepared for them.  As they drew near, some slight anxiety was  manifested by the escort of the King of England, amongst whom a belief  prevailed that that of the King of France was more numerous; but it was  soon perceived to be nothing of the sort.  The two kings, mounted upon  fine horses and superbly dressed, advanced towards one another; and Henry  VIII.'s horse stumbled, which his servants did not like.  The two kings  saluted each other with easy grace, exchanged embraces without getting  off their horses, dismounted, and proceeded arm-in-arm to the tent where  Wolsey and De Bonnivet were awaiting them.  \"My dear brother and cousin,\"  immediately said Francis with his easy grace, \"I am come a long way, and  not without trouble, to see you in person.  I hope that you hold me for  such as I am, ready to give you aid with the kingdoms and lordships that  are in my power.\"  Henry, with a somewhat cold reserve, replied, \"It is  not your kingdoms or your divers possessions that I regard, but the  soundness and loyal observance of the promises set down in the treaties  between you and me.  My eyes never beheld a prince who could be dearer to  my heart, and I have crossed the seas at the extreme boundary of my  kingdom to come and see you.\"  The two kings entered the tent and signed  a treaty whereby the Dauphin of France was to marry Princess Mary, only  daughter at that time of Henry VIII., to whom Francis I. undertook to pay  annually a sum of one hundred thousand livres [two million eight hundred  thousand francs, or one hundred and twelve thousand pounds in the money  of our day], until the marriage was celebrated, which would not be for  some time yet, as the English princess was only four years old.  The two  kings took wine together, according to custom, and reciprocally presented  the members of their courts.  \"King Francis,\" says Henry VIII.'s favorite  chronicler, Edward Hall, who was there, \"is an amiable prince, proud in  bearing and gay in manner, with a brown complexion, large eyes, long  nose, thick lips, broad chest and shoulders, short legs, and big feet.\"  Titian's portrait gives a loftier and more agreeable idea of Francis I.    When the two kings proceeded to sign, in their tent, the treaty they had  just concluded, \"the King of England,\" according to Fleuranges'  _Memoires,_ \"himself took up the articles and began to read them.  When  he had read those relating to the King of France, who was to have the  priority, and came to speak of himself, he got as far as, 'I, Henry,  King' .  .  .  (he would have said of _France and England_), but he left  out the title as far as France was concerned, and said to King Francis,  'I will not put it in as you are here, for I should lie;' and he said  only, 'I Henry, King of _England_.'\"  But, as M. Mignet very properly  says, \"if he omitted the title in his reading, he left it in the treaty  itself, and, shortly afterwards, was ambitious to render it a reality,  when he invaded France and wished to reign over it.\"    After the diplomatic stipulations were concluded, the royal meeting was  prolonged for sixteen days, which were employed in tourneys, jousts, and  all manner of festivals.  The personal communication of the two kings was  regulated with all the precautions of official mistrust and restraint;  and when the King of England went to Ardres to see the Queen of France,  the King of France had to go to Guines to see the Queen of England, for  the two kings were hostages for one another.  \"The King of France, who  was not a suspicious man,\" says Fleuranges, \"was mighty vexed at there  being so little confidence in one another.  He got up one morning very  early, which is not his habit, took two gentlemen and a page, the first  three he could find, mounted his horse, and went to visit the King of  England at the castle of Guines.  When he came on to the castle-bridge,  all the English were mighty astonished.  As he rode amongst them, the  king gayly called upon them to surrender to him, and asked them the way  to the chamber of the king his brother, the which was pointed out to him  by the governor of Guines, who said to him, 'Sir, he is not awake.'  But  King Francis passed on all the same, went up to the said chamber, knocked  at the door, awoke the King of England, and walked in.    [Illustration: Francis I. surprises Henry VIII.----44]    Never was man more dumbfounded than King Henry, who said to King Francis,  'Brother, you have done me a better turn than ever man did to another,  and you show me the great trust I ought to have in you.  I yield myself  your prisoner from this moment, and I proffer you my parole.'  He undid  from his neck a collar worth fifteen thousand angels, and begged the King  of France to take it and wear it that very day for his prisoner's sake.  And, lo, the king, who wished to do him the same turn, had brought with  him a bracelet which was worth more than thirty thousand angels, and  begged him to wear it for his sake, which thing he did, and the King of  France put what had been given him on his neck.  Thereupon the King of  England was minded to get up, and the King of France said that he should  have no other chamber-attendant but himself, and he warmed his shirt and  handed it to him when he was up.  The King of France made up his mind to  go back, notwithstanding that the King of England would have kept him to  dinner; but, inasmuch as there was to be jousting after dinner, he  mounted his horse and went back to Ardres.  He met a many good folk who  were coming to meet him, amongst the rest l'Aventureux [a name given to  Fleuranges himself], who said to him, 'My dear master, you are mad to  have done what you have done; I am very glad to see you back here, and  devil take him who counselled you.'  Whereupon the king said that never a  soul had counselled him, and that he knew well that there was not a soul  in his kingdom who would have so counselled him; and then he began to  tell what he had done at the said Guines, and so returned, conversing, to  Ardres, for it was not far.\"    \"Then began the jousts, which lasted a week, and were wondrous fine, both  a-foot and a-horseback.  After all these pastimes the King of France and  the King of England retired to a pavilion, where they drank together.  And there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#8)"],[1,"sent to the Duke  of Beauvilliers; \"there is no counting any longer on their patience, they  are reduced to such outrageous trials.  As they have nothing more to  hope, they have nothing more to fear.  The king has no right to risk  France in order to save Spain; he received his kingdom from God, not that  he should expose it to invasion by the enemy, as if it were a thing with  which he can do anything he pleases, but that he should rule it as a  father, and transmit it as a precious heirloom to his posterity.\"  He  demanded at the same time the convocation of the assembly of notables.    It was this kingdom, harassed on all sides by its enemies, bleeding,  exhausted, but stronger, nevertheless, and more bravely faithful than was  made out by Fenelon, that the new dauphin found himself suddenly called  upon to govern by the death of Monseigneur, and by the unexpected  confidence testified in him before long by the king.  \"The prince should  try more than ever to appear open, winning, accessible, and sociable,\"  wrote Fenelon; \"he must undeceive the public about the scruples imputed  to him; keep his strictness to himself, and not set the court  apprehending a severe reform of which society is not capable, and which  would have to be introduced imperceptibly, even if it were possible.  He  cannot be too careful to please the king, avoid giving him the slightest  umbrage, make him feel a dependence founded on confidence and affection,  relieve him in his work, and speak to him with a gentle and respectful  force which will grow by little and little.  He should say no more than  can be borne; it requires to have the heart prepared for the utterance  of painful truths which are not wont to be heard.  For the rest, no  puerilities or pettinesses in the practice of devotion; government is  learned better from studying men than from studying books.\"    The young dauphin was wise enough to profit by these sage and able  counsels.  \"Seconded to his heart's content by his adroit young wife,  herself in complete possession of the king's private ear and of the heart  of Madame de Maintenon, he redoubled his attentions to the latter, who,  in her transport at finding a dauphin on whom she might rely securely  instead of one who did not like her, put herself in his hands, and, by  that very act, put the king in his hands.  The first fortnight made  perceptible to all at Marly this extraordinary change in the king, who  was so reserved towards his legitimate children, so very much the king  with them.  Breathing more freely after so great a step had been made,  the dauphin showed a bold front to society, which he dreaded during the  lifetime of Monseigneur, because, great as he was, he was often the  victim of its best received jests.  The king having come round to him;  the insolent cabal having been dispersed by the death of a father, almost  an enemy, whose place he took; society in a state of respect, attention,  alacrity; the most prominent personages with an air of slavishness; the  gay and frivolous, no insignificant portion of a large court, at his feet  through his wife,--it was observed that this timid, shy,  self-concentrated prince, this precise (piece of) virtue, this (bit of)  misplaced learning, this gawky man, a stranger in his own house,  constrained in everything,--it was observed, I say, that he was showing  himself by degrees, unfolding himself little by little, presenting  himself to society in moderation, and that he was unembarrassed,  majestic, gay, and agreeable in it.  A style of conversation, easy but  instructive, and happily and aptly directed, charmed the sensible  courtier and made the rest wonder.  There was all at once an opening of  eyes, and ears, and hearts.  There was a taste of the consolation, which  was so necessary and so longed for, of seeing one's future master so well  fitted to be from his capacity and from the use that he showed he could  make of it.\"    The king had ordered ministers to go and do their work at the prince's.  The latter conversed modestly and discreetly with the men he thought  capable of enlightening him; the Duke of St. Simon had this honor, which  he owed to the friendship of the Duke of Beauvilliers, and of which he  showed himself sensible in his Memoires.  Fenelon was still at Cambrai,  \"which all at once turned out to be the only road from all the different  parts of Flanders.  The archbishop had such and so eager a court there,  that for all his delight he was pained by it, from apprehension of the  noise it would make, and the bad effect he feared it might have on the  king's mind.\"  He, however, kept writing to the dauphin, sending him  plans of government prepared long before; some wise, bold, liberal,  worthy of a mind that was broad and without prejudices; others chimerical  and impossible of application.  The prince examined them with care.  \"He had comprehended what it is to leave God for God's sake, and had set  about applying himself almost entirely to things which might make him  acquainted with government, having a sort of foretaste already of  reigning, and being more and more the hope of the nation, which was at  last beginning to appreciate him.\"    God had in former times given France a St. Louis.  He did not deem her  worthy of possessing such an ornament a second time.  The comfort and  hope which were just appearing in the midst of so many troubles vanished  suddenly like lightning; the dauphiness fell ill on the 5th of February;  she had a burning fever, and suffered from violent pains in the head; it  was believed to be scarlet-fever (rougeole), with whispers, at the same  time, of ugly symptoms; the malady went on increasing; the dauphin was  attacked in his turn; sacraments were mentioned; the princess, taken by  surprise, hesitated without daring to speak.  Her Jesuit confessor,  Father La Rue, himself proposed to go and fetch another priest.  A  _Recollet_ (Raptionist) was brought; when he arrived she was dying.  A  few hours later she expired, at the age of twenty-six, on the 12th of  February, 1712.  \"With her there was a total eclipse of joys, pleasures,  amusements even, and every sort of grace; darkness covered the whole face  of the court; she was the soul of it all, she filled it all, she pervaded  all the interior of it.\"  The king loved her as much as he was capable of  loving; she amused him and charmed him in the sombre moments of his life;  he, like the dauphin, had always been ignorant of the giddiness of which  she had been guilty; Madame de Maintenon, who knew of them, and who held  them as a rod over her, was only concerned to keep them secret; all the  court, with the exception of a few perfidious intriguers, made common  cause to serve her and please her.  \"Regularly ugly, pendent cheeks,  forehead too prominent, a nose that said nothing; of eyes the most  speaking and most beautiful in the world; a carriage of the head gallant,  majestic, graceful, and a look the same; smile the most expressive, waist  long, rounded, slight, supple; the gait of a goddess on the clouds; her  youthful, vivacious, energetic gayety, carried all before it, and her  nymph-like agility wafted her everywhere, like a whirlwind that fills  many places at once, and gives to them movement and life.  If the court  existed after her it was but to languish away.\"  [Memoires de St. Simon,  xi.]  There was only one blow more fatal for death to deal; and there was  not long to wait for it.    \"I have prayed, and I will pray,\" writes F6nelon.  \"God knows whether the  prince is for one instant forgotten.  I fancy I see him in the state in  which St. Augustin depicts himself: 'My heart is obscured by grief.  All  that I see reflects for me but the image of death.  All that was sweet to  me, when I could share it with her whom I loved, becomes a torment to me  since I lost her.  My eyes seek for her everywhere and find her nowhere.  When she was alive, wherever I might be without her, everything said to  me, You are going to see her.  Nothing says so now.  I find no solace but  in my tears.  I cannot bear the weight of my wounded and bleeding heart,  and yet I know not where to rest it.  I am wretched; for so it is when  the heart is set on the love of things that pass away.'\"  \"The days of  this affliction were soon shortened,\" says St. Simon; \"from the first  moment I saw him, I was scared at his fixed, haggard look, with a  something of ferocity, at the change in his countenance and the livid  marks I noticed upon it.  He was waiting at Marly for the king to awake;  they came to tell him he could go in; he turned without speaking a word,  without replying to his gentlemen (_menins_) who pressed him to go; I  went up to him, taking the liberty of giving him a gentle push; he gave  me a look, that pierced right to the heart, and went away.  I never  looked on him again.  Please God in His mercy I may look on him forever  there where his goodness, no doubt, has placed him!\"    It was a desperate but a short struggle.  Disease and grief were  victorious over the most sublime courage.  \"It was the spectacle of a man  beside himself, who was forcing himself to keep the surface smooth, and  who succumbed in the attempt.\"  The dauphin took to his bed on the 14th  of February; he believed himself to be poisoned, and said, from the  first, that he should never recover.  His piety alone, through the most  prodigious efforts, still kept up; he spoke no more, save to God,  continually lifting up his soul to him in fervent aspirations.  \"What  tender, but tranquil views!  What lively motions towards thanksgiving for  being preserved from the sceptre and the account that must be rendered  thereof!  What submission, and how complete!  What ardent love of God!  What a magnificent idea of infinite mercy!  What pious and humble awe!  What invincible patience!  What sweetness!  What constant kindness  towards all that approached him!  What pure charity"]]]
