Animals fed with madder for the purpose  of these experiments were found upon dissection to have thinner gall.  Comment. de rebus. Lipsiae. This circumstance is worth further attention.  The colouring materials of vegetables, like those which serve the purpose  of tanning, varnishing, and the various medical purposes, do not seem  essential to the life of the plant; but seem given it as a defence  against the depredations of insects or other animals, to whom these  materials are nauseous or deleterious. To insects and many smaller  animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones  which prey upon them. Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally  green; and earth-worms the colour of the earth which they inhabit;  Butterflies which frequent flowers, are coloured like them; small birds  which frequent hedges have greenish backs like the leaves, and light  coloured bellies like the sky, and are hence less visible to the hawk,  who passes under them or over them. Those birds which are much  amongst flowers, as the gold-finch (Fringilla carduelis), are furnished  with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of the dry  vegetables or earth on which they rest. And frogs vary their colour with  the mud of the streams which they frequent; and those which live on  trees are green. Fish, which are generally suspended in water, and  swallows, which are generally suspended in air, have their backs the  colour of the distant ground, and their bellies of the sky. In the colder  climates many of these become white during the existence of the snows.  Hence there is apparent design in the colours of animals, whilst those  of vegetables seem consequent to the other properties of the materials  which possess them.]              With chemic art _four_ favour'd youths aloof  380  Stain the white fleece, or stretch the tinted woof;          O'er Age's cheek the warmth of youth diffuse,          Or deck the pale-eyed nymph in roseate hues.

The story of AEson becoming  young, from the medicated bath of Medea, seems to have been intended to  teach the efficacy of warm bathing in retarding the progress of old  age. The words _relaxation and bracing_, which are generally thought  expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing, are mechanical terms,  properly applied to drums or strings; but are only metaphors when applied  to the effects of cold or warm bathing on animal bodies. The immediate  cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability of the finer  vessels or parts of our system; hence these cease to act, and collapse  or become horny or bony. The warm bath is peculiarly adapted to  prevent these circumstances by its increasing our irritability, and by  moistening and softening the skin, and the extremities of the finer  vessels, which terminate in it. To those who are past the meridian of  life, and have dry skins, and begin to be emaciated, the warm bath, for  half an hour twice a week, I believe to be eminently serviceable in  retarding the advances of age.]              Through his thrill'd nerves forgotten ardors dart,  390  And warmer eddies circle round his heart;          With softer fires his kindling eye-balls glow,          And darker tresses wanton round his brow.

They have their roots at the bottom of the  Rhone, the flowers of the female plant float on the surface of the  water, and are furnished with an elastic spiral stalk, which extends or  contracts as the water rises and falls; this rise or fall, from the rapid  descent of the river, and the mountain torrents which flow into it, often  amounts to many feet in a few hours. The flowers of the male plant are  produced under water, and as soon as their farina, or dust, is mature;  they detach themselves from the plant, and rise to the surface, continue  to flourish, and are wafted by the air, or borne by the currents to the  female flowers.

If the  pupils have not understood the cause of the flower-cluster scars, show  them their position in shoots where they are plainly on the summit of the  stem, and tell them to compare this with the arrangement of a large  bud. The flower-cluster terminates the axis in the bud, and this scar  terminates a branch. When the terminal bud is thus prevented from  continuing its growth, the nearest axillary buds are developed.[1] One  shoot usually gets the start, and becomes so much stronger that it throws  the other to one side. The tendency of the Horsechestnut to have its  growth carried on by the terminal buds is so strong that I almost feel  inclined to say that vigorous branches are never formed from axillary  buds, in old trees, except where the terminal bud has been prevented from  continuing the branch. This tendency gives to the tree its characteristic  size of trunk and branches, and lack of delicate spray. On looking closely  at the branches also, they will be seen to be quite irregular, wherever  there has been a flower-cluster swerving to one side or the other.    [Footnote 1: The first winter that I examined Horsechestnut buds I found,  in many cases, that the axillary shoots had from a quarter of an inch to  an inch of wood before the first set of rings. I could not imagine what  had formed this wood, and it remained a complete puzzle to me until the  following spring, when I found in the expanding shoots, that, wherever  a flower-cluster was present, there were one or two pairs of leaflets  already well developed in the axils, and that the next season's buds were  forming between them, while the internodes of these leaflets were making  quite a rapid growth. Subsequently, I found the leaflets also in the buds  themselves. I found these leaflets developed on the tree only in the  shoots containing flower-clusters, where they would be needed for the  future growth of the branches. I suppose the reason must be that the  flower-cluster does not use all the nourishment provided and that  therefore the axillary buds are able to develop. It would be interesting  to know what determines the stronger growth of the one which eventually  becomes the leader.]    There is one thing more the pupils may have noticed. The small round dots  all over the young stem, which become long rifts in the older parts, are  breaks in the epidermis, or skin of the stem, through which the inner  layers of bark protrude. They are called lenticels. They provide a passage  for gases in and out of the stem. In some trees, as the Birch, they are  very noticeable.    After discussing the subject thoroughly in the class-room, the pupils  should rewrite their papers, and finally answer the following questions,  as a species of review. I have thus spent three recitations on the  Horsechestnut. The work is all so new, and, if properly presented,  so interesting, that a good deal of time is required to exhaust its  possibilities of instruction. If the teacher finds his scholars wearying,  however, he can leave as many of the details as he pleases to be treated  in connection with other branches.      QUESTIONS ON THE HORSECHESTNUT.    How many scales are there in the buds you have examined?    How are they arranged?    How many leaves are there in the buds?    How are they arranged?    Where does the flower-cluster come in the bud?    Do all the buds contain flower-clusters?    What is the use of the wool and the gum?    Where do the buds come on the stem?    Which are the strongest?    How are the leaves arranged on the stem?    Do the pairs stand directly over each other?    What are the dots on the leaf-scars?    How old is your branch?    How old is each twig?    Which years were the best for growth?    Where were the former flower-clusters?    What happens when a branch is stopped in its growth by flowering?    What effect does this have on the appearance of the tree?    In some parts of the country the Horsechestnut is not so commonly planted  as in New England. In the southern states the Magnolia may be used in its  stead, but it is not nearly so simple an example of the main points to be  observed.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VII. Trees in Winter.]      MAGNOLIA UMBRELLA.    The bud may be examined by removing the scales with a knife, as in  Horsechestnut, and also by cutting sections. The outer scales enfold the  whole bud, and each succeeding pair cover all within. They are joined,  and it is frequently difficult to tell where the suture is, though it can  generally be traced at the apex of the bud. On the back is a thick  stalk, which is the base of the leaf-stalk. Remove the scales by cutting  carefully through a single pair, opposite the leaf-stalk, and peeling  them off. The scales are modified stipules, instead of leaf-stalks, as in  Horsechestnut. The outer pair are brown and thick, the inner green, and  becoming more delicate and crumpled as we proceed toward the centre of the  bud. The leaves begin with the second or third pair of scales. The first  one or two are imperfect, being small, brown, and dry. The leaves grow  larger towards the centre of the bud. They are covered with short,  silky hairs, and are folded lengthwise, with the inner surface within  (_conduplicate_). In the specimens I have examined I do not see much  difference in size between the buds with flowers and those without. In  every bud examined which contained a flower, there was an axillary bud in  the axil of the last, or next to the last, leaf. This bud is to continue  the interrupted branch in the same way as in Horsechestnut.    There are from six to ten good leaves, in the buds that I have seen. Those  without flowers contain more leaves, as in Horsechestnut. In the centre of  these buds the leaves are small and undeveloped. The flower is very easy  to examine, the floral envelopes, stamens and pistils, being plainly  discernible. The bud may also be studied in cross-section. This shows the  whole arrangement. The plan is not so simple as in Horsechestnut, where  the leaves are opposite. The subject of leaf-arrangement should be passed  over until phyllotaxy is taken up.    The scars on the stem differ from Horsechestnut in having no distinct  bands of rings. The scales, being stipules, leave a line on each side of  the leaf-scar, and these are separated by the growth of the internodes.  In the Beech, the scales are also stipules; but, whereas in the Magnolia  there are only one or two abortive leaves, in the Beech there are eight or  nine pairs of stipules without any leaves at all. The rings thus become  separated in Magnolia, while in the Beech the first internodes are not  developed, leaving a distinct band of rings, to mark the season's growth.  The Magnolia is therefore less desirable to begin upon. The branches are  swollen at the beginning of a new growth, and have a number of leaf-scars  crowded closely together. The leaf-scars are roundish, the lower line more  curved. They have many dots on them. From each leaf-scar runs an irregular  line around the stem. This has been left by the stipules.    The flower-scar is on the summit of the axis, and often apparently in the  axil of a branch, as in Horsechestnut. Sometimes the nearest axillary bud  is developed; sometimes there are two, when the branch forks. The axillary  buds seldom grow unless the terminal bud is interrupted. The tree  therefore has no fine spray.      LILAC _(Syringa vulgaris_).    Ask the scholars to write a description of their branches and to compare  them with Horsechestnut. These papers should be prepared before coming  into the class, as before.    The buds are four-sided. The scales and leaves are opposite, as in  Horsechestnut. The outer pair sometimes have buds in their axils. Remove  the scales one by one with a knife, or better, with a stout needle. The  scales gradually become thinner as we proceed, and pass into leaves, so  that we cannot tell where the scales end and leaves begin. After about six  pairs are removed, we come, in the larger buds, to leaves with axillary  flower-clusters. The leaves grow smaller and the flower-clusters  larger till we come to the centre, where the axis is terminated by a  flower-cluster. There is a great difference in the buds on different  bushes and on shoots of the same bush, some being large, green, and easy  to examine, others small, hard, and dark-colored. It is better, of course,  to select as soft and large buds as possible for examination.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Lilac. I. Branch in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar;  _b_, bud-scar (reduced). 2. Same, less reduced. 3. Branch, with leaf-buds  expanded. 4. Series in a single bud, showing the gradual transition from  scales to leaves.]    That the scales are modified leaves is plainly shown by the gradual  transition they undergo, and also by the fact that buds are developed in  their axils. If any of these can be shown to the pupils, remind them of  the experiment where the top of a seedling Pea was cut off and buds forced  to develop in the axils of the lower scales.[1] The transition from scales  to leaves can be well studied by bringing branches into the house, where  they will develop in water, and towards spring may even be made to  blossom. Cherry, Apple, Forsythia, and other blossoming trees and shrubs  can be thus forced to bloom. Place the branches in hot water, and cut off  a little of their ends under water. If the water is changed every day,  and the glass kept near the register or stove, they will blossom out very  quickly. These expanded shoots may be compared with the buds. The number  of leaves in the bud varies.    [Footnote 1: See p. 31.]    The leaf-scars of Lilac are horseshoe-shaped and somewhat swollen.
