Strange was their mingling in the sky,      It hush'd the listener's breath;    For the music spoke of triumph high,      The lonely bell, of death.      There was hurrying through the midnight:--      A sound of many feet;    But they fell with a muffled fearfulness,      Along the shadowy street;    And softer, fainter, grew their tread,      As it near'd the Minster-gate,    Whence broad and solemn light was shed      From a scene of royal state.      Full glow'd the strong red radiance      In the centre of the nave,    Where the folds of a purple canopy      Sweep down in many a wave;    Loading the marble pavement old      With a weight of gorgeous gloom;    For something lay 'midst their fretted gold,      Like a shadow of the tomb.      And within that rich pavilion      High on a glittering throne,    A woman's form sat silently,      Midst the glare of light alone.    Her Jewell'd robes fell strangely still--      The drapery on her breast    Seem'd with no pulse beneath to thrill,      So stone-like was its rest.      But a peal of lordly music      Shook e'en the dust below,    When the burning gold of the diadem      Was set on her pallid brow!    Then died away that haughty sound,      And from th' encircling band,    Stept Prince and Chief, 'midst the hush profound,      With homage to her hand.      Why pass'd a faint cold shuddering      Over each martial frame,    As one by one, to touch that hand,      Noble and leader came?    Was not the settled aspect fair?      Did not a queenly grace,    Under the parted ebon hair.      Sit on the pale still face?      Death, Death! canst _thou_ be lovely      Unto the eye of Life?    Is not each pulse of the quick high breast      With thy cold mien at strife?    --It was a strange and fearful sight,      The crown upon that head,    The glorious robes and the blaze of light,      All gather'd round the Dead!      And beside her stood in silence      One with a brow as pale,    And white lips rigidly compress'd,      Lest the strong heart should fail;    King Pedro with a jealous eye      Watching the homage done    By the land's flower and chivalry      To her, his martyr'd one.      But on the face he look'd not      Which once his star had been:    To every form his glance was turn'd,      Save of the breathless queen;    Though something, won from the grare's embrace,      Of her beauty still was there,    Its hues were all of that shadowy place,      'Twas not for _him_ to bear.      Alas! the crown, the sceptre,      The treasures of the earth,    And the priceless love that pour'd those gifts,      Alike of wasted worth!    The rites are closed--bear back the Dead      Unto the chamber deep,    Lay down again the royal head,      Dust with the dust to sleep.      There is music on the midnight--      A requiem sad and slow.    As the mourners through the sounding aisle      In dark procession go,    And the ring of state, and the starry crown,      And all the rich array,    Are borne to the house of silence down,      With her, that queen of clay.      And tearlessly and firmly,      King Pedro led the train--    But his face was wrapt in his folding robe,      When they lower'd the dust again.    --'Tis hush'd at last, the tomb above,      Hymns die, and steps depart:    Who call'd thee strong as Death, O Love?      _Mightier_ thou wert and art!                       _New Monthly Magazine._        [7] Don Pedro of Portugal, after his accession to the kingdom,      had the body of the murdered Inez taken from the grave, solemnly      enthroned and crowned.           *       *       *       *       *      ART THOU THE MAID?

I fain would think thou art not she      Who hung upon mine arm,    When love was yet a mystery,      A sweet, resistless charm.      It seemed to me as though the spell      On both alike were cast;    I prayed but in thy sight to dwell,      For thee, to breathe my last.      Mine inmost secret soul was thine,      Thou wert enthroned therein,    Like sculptured saint in holy shrine,      All free from guile and sin.      And, heaven forgive! I did adore      With more than pilgrim's zeal;    And then thy smile----But oh! no more!      No more may I reveal.      Enough--we're parted----Both must own      The accursed power of gold.    I wander through the world _alone_;      _Thou_ hast been bought and sold.                        _Blackwood's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *    It would be a very pleasant thing, if literary productions could be  submitted to something like chemical analysis,--if we could separate the  merit of a book, as we can the magnesia of Epsom salts, by a simple  practical application of the doctrine of affinities.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER          A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.

The secretary of a literary society being requested to draw up \"_a  definition of a good fellow_,\" applied to the members of the club,  individually, for such hints as they could furnish, when, he received  the following:--    Mr. _Golightly_.--A good fellow is one who rides blood horses, drives  four-in-hand, speaks when he's spoken to, sings when he's asked, always  turns his back on a dun, and never on a friend.    Mr. _Le Blanc_.--A good fellow is one who studies deep, reads  trigonometry, and burns love songs; has a most cordial aversion for  dancing and D'Egville, and would rather encounter a cannon than a fancy  ball.    Hon. _G. Montgomery_.--A good fellow is one who abhors moralists and  mathematics, and adores the classics and Caroline Mowbray.    Sir _T. Wentworth_.--A good fellow is one who attends the Fox-dinners,  who goes to the Indies to purchase independence, and would rather  encounter a buffalo than a boroughmonger.    Mr. _M. Sterling_.--A good fellow is a good neighbour, a good citizen, a  good relation; in short, a good man.    Mr. _M. Farlane_.--A good fellow is a bonnie braw John Hielandman.    Mr. _O'Connor_.--A good fellow is one who talks loud and swears louder;  cares little about learning, and less about his neckcloth; loves  whiskey, patronizes bargemen, and wears nails in his shoes.    Mr. _Musgrave_.--A good fellow is prime--flash--and bang-up.    Mr. _Burton_.--A good fellow is one who knows \"what's what,\" keeps  accounts, and studies Cocker.    Mr. _Rowley_.--A good fellow likes turtle and cold punch, drinks Port  when he can't get Champagne, and dines on mutton with Sir Robert, when  he can't get venison at my lord's.    Mr. _Lozell_.--A good fellow is something compounded of the preceding.    Mr. _Oakley_.--A good fellow is something perfectly different from the  preceding,--or Mr. Oakley is an ass.           *       *       *       *       *      MERCHANT TAILORS' SCHOOL.        At Merchant Tailors' School, what time      Old Bishop held the rod,    The boys rehearsed the old man's rhyme      Whilst he would smile and nod.      Apart I view'd a little child      Who join'd not in the game:    His face was what mammas call mild      And fathers dull and tame.      Pitying the boy, I thus address'd      The pedagogue of verse--    \"Why doth he not, Sir, like the rest,      Your epigrams rehearse?\"      \"Sir!\" answered thus the aged man,      \"He's not in Nature's debt;    His ears so tight are seal'd, he can-      Not learn his alphabet.\"      \"Why not?\" I cried:--whereat to me      He spoke in minor clef--    \"He cannot learn his A, B, C,      Because he's D, E, F.\"                         _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      ROYAL LEARNING.      The king of Persia made many inquiries of Sir Harford Jones respecting  America, saying, \"What sort of a place is it? How do you get at it? Is  it underground, or how?\"           *       *       *       *       *      COMPLIMENT MAL-APROPOS.      Napoleon was once present at the performance of one of Pasiello's  operas, in which was introduced an air by Cimarosa. Pasiello was in the  box with the emperor, and received many compliments during the evening.  At length, when the air by Cimarosa was played, the emperor turned  round, and taking Pasiello by the hand, exclaimed, \"By my faith, my  friend, the man who has composed that air, may proclaim himself the  greatest composer in Europe.\" \"It is Cimarosa's,\" feebly articulated  Pasiello. \"I am sorry for it; but I cannot recall what I have said.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A gentleman taking an apartment, said to the landlady, \"I assure you,  madam, I never left a lodging but my landlady shed tears.\" She answered,  \"I hope it was not, Sir, because you went away without paying.\"           *       *       *       *       *    LOMBIRD'S EDITION OF THE _Following Novels are already Published:_                                          _s_  _d_  Mackenzie's Man of Feeling . . . . . . 0    6  Paul and Virginia. . . . . . . . . . . 0    6  The Castle of Otranto. . . . . . . . . 0    6  Almoran and Hamet. . . . . . . . . . . 0    6  Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia. . 0    6  The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne . . 0    6  Rasselas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0    8  The Old English Baron. . . . . . . . . 0    8  Nature and Art . . . . . . . . . . . . 0    8  Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield . . . . 0   10  Sicilian Romance . . . . . . . . . . . 1    0  The Man of the World . . . . . . . . . 1    0  A Simple Story . . . . . . . . . . . . 1    4  Joseph Andrews . . . . . . . . . . . . 1    6  Humphry Clinker. . . . . . . . . . . . 1    8  The Romance of the Forest. . . . . . . 1    8  The Italian. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2    0  Zeluce, by Dr. Moore . . . . . . . . . 2    6"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#8)"],[1,"his knapsack upon his shoulder, lumbered off. In how  many such hearts is there this sullen revolt against the military  system, and how much of a factor will it be to reckon with in the  future?    There were four prisoners quite separated from the rest of us. It  was said that they were sentenced to be shot. I am not sure that  they were; but we were strictly forbidden any intercourse with  them. They were the most crestfallen, terror-stricken lot of men  that ever I had laid eyes upon, and at four o'clock they were led  away by a cordon of soldiers. There was enough mental suggestion  about it to plunge the room into a deep silence. It was oppressive.    At last Obels, the reporter, walked over and asked me if there  were proofs of the immortality of the soul, excusing himself by  saying that up to this time he had never had any particular time nor  reason for reflection on this subject. That was the only  psychological blunder that he made. However, it at last broke the  heavy, painful silence, and we speculated together, instead of  singly, how it might feel to have immortal bliss thrust upon us from  the end of a German musket.    I related to him my experience of the previous week. Some war  photographers wanted a picture of a spy shot. I had volunteered to  play the part of a spy, and, after being blindfolded, was led over  against a wall, where a Belgian squad leveled their rifles at me. I  assured him that the sensation was by no means terrible; but he  would not be comforted. Death itself he wouldn't mind so much, if  he could have found it in the open fighting gladly for his country;  but it seemed a blot on his good name to be shot for just snooping  around the German lines.    On the whole, after weighing all the pros and cons, we decided  that our pronounced aversion to being shot had purely an altruistic  origin. It was a wicked, shameful loss to the human race. That  point was very clear to us. But there was the arrant stupidity of the  Germans to be reckoned with. They have such a distorted sense  of real values. Rummaging through my pockets during these  reflections, I fished up an advertising folder out of a corner where I  had tucked it when it was presented to me by Dr. Morse. The  outside read, \"How We Lost Our Best Customer.\" Mechanically I  opened it, and there, staring back at me from big black borders on  the inside, were the two words, \"HE DIED.\"    These ruminations upon matters spiritual were interrupted by the  strains from a brass band which went crashing by, while ten  thousand hobnailed boots of the regiment striking the pavements  in unison beat out time like a trip-hammer.    \"Perhaps the Germans are leaving Brussels,\" whispered a  companion; \"and wouldn't we grow wild or faint or crazy to see  those guards drop away and we should find ourselves free men  again!\"    The passing music had a jubilating effect upon our guards, who  paraded gayly up and down the room. One simple, good-hearted  fellow harangued us in a bantering way, pointing out our present  sorry plight as evidence of the sad mistake we had made in not  being born in Germany. He felt so happy that he took a little  collection from us, and in due time returned with some bread and  chocolate and soda water. But even the soda water, as if adjusting  itself to the spiritlessness of the prisoners, refused to effervesce.  The music had by contrast seemed only to increase the general  depression.    Only one free spirit soared above his surroundings. He was a  young Belgian--Ernest de Burgher by name--a kindly light amidst  the encircling gloom. He took everything in life with a smile. I am  sure that if death as a spy had been ordered for him at the door,  he would have met that with the same happy, imperturbable  expression. He had quite as much reason as I, if not more, for  joining our gloom-party. He, too, was waiting sentence. For six  days his wild, untamed spirit had been cabined in these walls; but  he had been born a humorist, and even in bonds he sought to play  the clown. He went through contortions, pitched coins against  himself, and staggered around the room with a soda-water bottle  at his lips, imitating a drunkard. But ours was a tough house even  for his irrepressible spirit to play to. Despite all his efforts, we sat  around like a convention of corpses, and only once did his comic  spirit succeed.    One prisoner sunk down in a comatose condition in his chair, as  though his last drop of strength and life had oozed away. Now de  Burgher was one of those who can resist anything but temptation.  He stole over and tied the man's legs to his chair. Then he got a  German soldier to tap the hapless victim on the shoulder. Roused  from his stupor to see the soldier standing over him like a  messenger of doom, the poor fellow turned ashen pale. He sprang  to his feet, but the chair bound to his legs tripped him up and he  fell sprawling on the floor. He apparently regarded the chair as  some sort of German infernal machine clutching him, and he lay  there wrestling with his inanimate antagonist as though it were a  demon. As soon as the victim understood the joke he joined in the  burst of merriment that ran round the room; but it was of short  duration. The gloom got us again, despite all that de Burgher could  do, and finally he succumbed to the prevailing atmosphere and  gave us up as a bad job.    He was a diminutive fellow, battered and rather the worse for wear.  Ever shall I think of him not only as the happy-souled, but as the  great-souled. My introduction into the room was at the point of a  steel bayonet. With him, that served me far better than any gilt-  edged introduction of high estate. He didn't know what crime was  charged against, me, but he felt that it must have been a sacrifice  for Belgium's sake. The fact that I was persona non grata to the  Germans was a lien upon his sympathy, and gave me high rank  with him at once. He instinctively divined my feelings of fear and  loneliness, and straightway set out to make me his ward, his  comrade, and his master.    Never shall I forget how, during that long night in prison, he  crawled over and around the recumbent forms to where I lay upon  the floor courting sleep in vain. I was frightened by this maneuver,  but he smiled and motioned me to silence. Reaching up beneath  my blanket, he unlaced one shoe and then the other. At first I  really thought that he was going to steal them, but the reaction  from the day had set in and I was too tired and paralyzed to make  any protest. Laying the shoes one side, he remarked, \"That will  ease your feet.\" Then stripping off his coat and rolling it into a  bundle, he placed it as a pillow beneath my head.    A great, big hulking American, treated tenderly by this little Belgian,  how could I keep the tears from my eyes? And as they came  welling up--tears of appreciation for the generous fineness of his  spirit--he took them to be tears of grief, brought on by thoughts of  home and friends and all those haunting memories. But he was  equal to the occasion.    In a little vacant space he made a circle of cigarettes and small  Belgian coins. In the center he placed a small box, and on it laid a  ruler. \"This is the roulette wheel at Monte Carlo, and you are the  rich American,\" he whispered, and with a snap of the finger he  spun the ruler round. Whenever it stopped, he presented me my  prize with sundry winkings and chucklings, interrupted by furtive  glances towards the door.    Rouge-et-noir upon a prison floor! To him existence was such a  game--red life or black death, as the fates ordained. His spirit was  contagious, and I found myself smiling through my tears. When he  saw his task accomplished, gathering in his coins, he crawled  away.    His was a restless spirit. Only once did I see him steadfastly quiet.  That was the next morning, when he sat with his eyes fixed upon  an opening in the shutter. He insisted upon my taking his seat, and  adjusting my angle of vision properly. There, framed in a window  across the forbidden courtyard, was a pretty girl watering flowers.  She was indeed a distracting creature, and de Burgher danced  around me with unfeigned glee. His previous experience with  Americans had evidently led him to believe that we were all  connoisseurs in pretty girls. I tried valiantly to uphold our national  reputation, but my thoughts at the time were much more heavenly  than even that fair apparition framed in the window, and I fear I  disappointed de Burgher by my lack of enthusiasm.    My other comrade, Constance Staes, must not be forgotten. For  some infraction of the new military regulations he had been hustled  off to prison, but he, too, was born for liberty, a free-ranging spirit  that fetters could never bind. He made me see the Belgian soul  that would never be subservient to German rule. The Germans  can be overlords in Belgium only when such spirits have either  emigrated or have been totally exterminated.    To Constance Staes every rule was a challenge. That's the reason  he had been put in jail. He had trespassed on forbidden way in  front of the East Station. Here in prison smoking was forbidden. So  Staes, with one eye upon the listless guard, would slip beneath a  blanket, take a pull at his cigarette, and come up again as innocent  as though he had been saying his prayers. I refused the offer of a  pull at his cigarette, but not the morsel of white bread which he  drew from behind a picture and shared with me. That bread,  broken and shared between us in that upper room, is to me an  eternal sacrament. It fed my body hunger then; never shall it  cease to feed the hunger of my soul.    Whenever temptation to play the cynic or think meanly of my  fellow-man shall come, my mind will hark back to those two  unpretending fellows and bow in reverence before the selflessness  and immensity of the human soul. Needing bread, they gave it  freely away; needing"]]]
