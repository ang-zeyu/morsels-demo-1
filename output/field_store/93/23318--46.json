With a population of about six hundred thousand this  province exported annually two million dollars' worth of raw silk,  silkworm-raising being a specialty of the Lebanon.    When autonomy was granted the Lebanon, French influence became  predominant among the Maronites and other Christians of the province.  French is spoken by almost all of them, and love for France is a  deep-rooted sentiment of the people. On the other hand, the Druses feel  the English influence. For the last sixty years England has been the  friend of the Druses, and they have not forgotten it.    It may be worth while to tell in a few words the story of one man who  accomplished wonders in spreading the influence of his country. Sir  Richard Wood was born in London, a son of Catholic parents. From his  early boyhood he aspired to enter the diplomatic service. The East  attracted him strongly, and in order to learn Arabic he went with  another young Englishman to live in the Lebanon. In Beirut they sought  the hospitality of the Maronite patriarch. For a few days they were  treated with lavish hospitality, and then the patriarch summoned them  before him and told them that they must leave the city within  twenty-four hours. The reason for their disgrace they discovered later.  Not suspecting that they were being put to the test, they had eaten meat  on a Friday, and this made the patriarch think that they were not true  Catholics, but were there as spies.    Leaving Beirut in haste, Wood and his friend sought shelter with the  Druses, who received them with open arms. For two years Wood lived  among the Druses, in the village of Obey. There he learned Arabic and  became thoroughly acquainted with the country and with the ways of the  Druses, and there he conceived the idea of winning the Druses for  England to counteract the influence of the French Maronites. He went  back to London, where he succeeded in impressing his views upon the  Foreign Office, and he returned to Syria charged with a secret mission.  Before long he persuaded the Druse chieftains to address a petition to  England asking for British protection.    British protection was granted, and for over thirty years Richard Wood,  virtually single-handed, shaped the destiny of Syria. It was he who  broke the power of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mehemet Ali; it was he who  guided Admiral Stopford in the bombardment of Beirut; it was he, again,  who brought about the landing of English troops in Syria in 1841; we  find him afterwards in Damascus as British Consul, and wherever he went  he was always busy spreading English power and prestige. He understood  the East thoroughly and felt that England must be strong in Syria if she  wished to retain her imperial power. It is very unfortunate that the  policy of Sir Richard Wood was not carried out by his nation.    It was with high hopes and expectations that I approached the Lebanon.  I was looking forward to the moment when I should find myself among  people who were free from the Turkish yoke, in a country where I should  be able to breathe freely for a few hours.    But how great was my consternation, when, on entering the Lebanon, I  found on all the roads Turkish soldiers who stopped me every minute to  ask for my papers! Even then I could not realize that the worst had  happened. Of course, rumors of the Turkish occupation of the Lebanon had  reached us a few weeks before, but we had not believed it, as we knew  that Germany and Austria were among those who guaranteed the autonomy of  the Lebanon. It was true, however; the scrap of paper that guaranteed  the freedom of the Lebanon had proved of no more value to the Lebanese  than had that other scrap of paper to Belgium. As I entered the  beautiful village of Ed-Damur, one of the most prosperous and enchanting  places on earth, I saw entire regiments of Turkish troops encamped in  and about the village.    While I was watering my horse, I tried to ask questions from a few  inhabitants. My fair hair and complexion and my khaki costume made them  take me for a German, and they barely answered me, but when I addressed  them in French their faces lit up. For the Lebanon, for all it is  thousands of miles away from France, is nevertheless like a French  province. For fifty years the French language and French culture have  taken hold of the Lebanon. No Frenchman has more love for and faith in  France than lie in the hearts of the Lebanese Christians. They have  never forgotten that when massacres were threatening to wipe out all the  Christians of the Lebanon, ten thousand French soldiers swept over the  mountains to spread peace, life, and French gayety.    And when the poor people heard the language they loved, and when they  found out that I too was the son of an oppressed and ruined community,  all the sadness and bitterness of their hearts was told me,--how the  Turkish soldiers had spread over the beloved mountains of Lebanon; how  the strong, stalwart young Lebanese had been taken away from the  mountains and forced into the Turkish army; how the girls and women were  hiding in their homes, afraid to be seen by the soldiers and their  officers; how the chieftains were imprisoned and even hanged; and how  violence and pillage had spread over the peaceful country.[Footnote:  Since the above was written the American press has chronicled many  atrocities committed in the Lebanon. The execution of leaders and the  complete blockade of the mountains by the Turkish authorities resulted  in the starving of eighty thousand Lebanese. The French Government has  warned Turkey through the American Ambassador that the Turks will be  held accountable for their deeds.]    I could not help wondering at the mistakes of the Allies. If they had  understood the situation in Palestine and Syria, how differently this  war might have eventuated! The Lebanon and Syria would have raised a  hundred thousand picked men, if the Allies had landed in Palestine. The  Lebanon would have fought for its independence as heroically as did the  Belgians. Even the Arab population would have welcomed the Allies as  liberators. But alas!    With a saddened heart I pursued my journey into Beirut. My coming was a  joyful surprise to my sister. Many sad things had happened since she had  last seen me. During my imprisonment she had suffered tortures, not  knowing what would happen to me, and now that she saw me alive she cried  from happiness. She told me how kindly she had been treated by President  Bliss, of the Syrian Protestant College, and of all the good things the  college had done.    What a blessing the college was for the people of Beirut! Many  unfortunate people were saved from prison and hardships through the  intervention of President Bliss. He never tired of rendering service,  wonderful personal service. But alas, even his influence and power began  to wane. The American prestige in the country was broken, and the  Turkish Government no longer respected the American flag. An order  issued from Constantinople demanded that the official language of the  college be Turkish instead of English, and Turkish officers even dared  to enter the college premises to search for citizens belonging to the  belligerent nations, without troubling to ask permission from the  American Consul.    [ILLUSTRATION: HAIFA]          CHAPTER IX    A ROBBER BARON OF PALESTINE      Beirut is a city of about two hundred thousand inhabitants, half of whom  are Christians and the rest Mohammedans and Jews. The pinch of hunger  was already felt there. Bread was to be had only on tickets issued by  the Government, and prices in general were extremely high. The  population were discontented and turbulent, and every day thousands of  women came before the governor's residence to cry and protest against  the scarcity of bread.    The Allies' warships often passed near the town, but the people were not  afraid of them, for it was known that the Allies had no intention of  bombarding the cities. Only once had a bombardment taken place. Toward  the end of March, 1915, a French warship approached the bay of Haifa and  landed an officer with a letter to the commandant of that town giving  notice of his intention to bombard the German Consulate at 3 P.M. sharp.  This was in retaliation for the propaganda carried on by the consul,  Leutweld von Hardegg, and chiefly because of his desecration of the  grave of Bonaparte's soldiers. The consul had time to pack up his  archives and valuables, and he left his house before three. The  bombardment began exactly at three. Fifteen shells were fired with a  wonderful precision. Not one house in the neighborhood of the consulate  was touched, but the consulate itself was a heap of ruins after a few  shells had struck it. The population was exceedingly calm. Only the  German colony was panic-stricken, and on every German house an American  flag was raised. It was rather humorous to see all the Germans who were  active in the Turkish army in one capacity or another seek safety by  means of this trick.    This bombardment had a sobering effect upon the Mohammedan population.  They saw that the Allies were not wholly ignorant of what was going on  in the country and that they could retaliate, and safety for the  non-Mohammedans increased accordingly.    In general Beirut was a rather quiet and safe place. The presence of an  American cruiser in the port had much to do with that. The American  sailors were allowed to come ashore three times a week, and they spent  their money lavishly. It was estimated that Beirut was getting more than  five thousand dollars a week out of them. But the natives were  especially impressed by the manliness and quick action of the American  boys. Frequently a few sailors were involved in a street fight with  scores of Arabs, and they always held their own. In a short time the  Americans became feared, which in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#8)"],[1," old weather-board shanty that had been a sly-grog-shop,  and the Lord knows what else! in the palmy days of Gulgong; and I did  a bit of digging ('fossicking', rather), a bit of shearing, a bit of  fencing, a bit of Bush-carpentering, tank-sinking,--anything, just to  keep the billy boiling.    We had a lot of trouble with Jim with his teeth. He was bad with every  one of them, and we had most of them lanced--couldn't pull him through  without. I remember we got one lanced and the gum healed over before  the tooth came through, and we had to get it cut again. He was a plucky  little chap, and after the first time he never whimpered when the doctor  was lancing his gum: he used to say 'tar' afterwards, and want to bring  the lance home with him.    The first turn we got with Jim was the worst. I had had the wife and Jim  out camping with me in a tent at a dam I was making at Cattle Creek; I  had two men working for me, and a boy to drive one of the tip-drays,  and I took Mary out to cook for us. And it was lucky for us that the  contract was finished and we got back to Gulgong, and within reach of  a doctor, the day we did. We were just camping in the house, with our  goods and chattels anyhow, for the night; and we were hardly back home  an hour when Jim took convulsions for the first time.    Did you ever see a child in convulsions? You wouldn't want to see it  again: it plays the devil with a man's nerves. I'd got the beds fixed up  on the floor, and the billies on the fire--I was going to make some tea,  and put a piece of corned beef on to boil over night--when Jim  (he'd been queer all day, and his mother was trying to hush him to  sleep)--Jim, he screamed out twice. He'd been crying a good deal, and  I was dog-tired and worried (over some money a man owed me) or I'd have  noticed at once that there was something unusual in the way the child  cried out: as it was I didn't turn round till Mary screamed 'Joe!  Joe!' You know how a woman cries out when her child is in danger or  dying--short, and sharp, and terrible. 'Joe! Look! look! Oh, my God! our  child! Get the bath, quick! quick! it's convulsions!'    Jim was bent back like a bow, stiff as a bullock-yoke, in his mother's  arms, and his eyeballs were turned up and fixed--a thing I saw twice  afterwards, and don't want ever to see again.    I was falling over things getting the tub and the hot water, when the  woman who lived next door rushed in. She called to her husband to run  for the doctor, and before the doctor came she and Mary had got Jim into  a hot bath and pulled him through.    The neighbour woman made me up a shake-down in another room, and stayed  with Mary that night; but it was a long while before I got Jim and  Mary's screams out of my head and fell asleep.    You may depend I kept the fire in, and a bucket of water hot over it,  for a good many nights after that; but (it always happens like this)  there came a night, when the fright had worn off, when I was too tired  to bother about the fire, and that night Jim took us by surprise. Our  wood-heap was done, and I broke up a new chair to get a fire, and had  to run a quarter of a mile for water; but this turn wasn't so bad as the  first, and we pulled him through.    You never saw a child in convulsions? Well, you don't want to. It must  be only a matter of seconds, but it seems long minutes; and half an  hour afterwards the child might be laughing and playing with you,  or stretched out dead. It shook me up a lot. I was always pretty  high-strung and sensitive. After Jim took the first fit, every time he  cried, or turned over, or stretched out in the night, I'd jump: I was  always feeling his forehead in the dark to see if he was feverish, or  feeling his limbs to see if he was 'limp' yet. Mary and I often laughed  about it--afterwards. I tried sleeping in another room, but for nights  after Jim's first attack I'd be just dozing off into a sound sleep,  when I'd hear him scream, as plain as could be, and I'd hear Mary cry,  'Joe!--Joe!'--short, sharp, and terrible--and I'd be up and into their  room like a shot, only to find them sleeping peacefully. Then I'd feel  Jim's head and his breathing for signs of convulsions, see to the fire  and water, and go back to bed and try to sleep. For the first few nights  I was like that all night, and I'd feel relieved when daylight came.  I'd be in first thing to see if they were all right; then I'd sleep till  dinner-time if it was Sunday or I had no work. But then I was run down  about that time: I was worried about some money for a wool-shed I put up  and never got paid for; and, besides, I'd been pretty wild before I met  Mary.    I was fighting hard then--struggling for something better. Both Mary and  I were born to better things, and that's what made the life so hard for  us.    Jim got on all right for a while: we used to watch him well, and have  his teeth lanced in time.    It used to hurt and worry me to see how--just as he was getting fat  and rosy and like a natural happy child, and I'd feel proud to take him  out--a tooth would come along, and he'd get thin and white and pale and  bigger-eyed and old-fashioned. We'd say, 'He'll be safe when he gets his  eye-teeth': but he didn't get them till he was two; then, 'He'll be safe  when he gets his two-year-old teeth': they didn't come till he was going  on for three.    He was a wonderful little chap--Yes, I know all about parents thinking  that their child is the best in the world. If your boy is small for his  age, friends will say that small children make big men; that he's a  very bright, intelligent child, and that it's better to have a bright,  intelligent child than a big, sleepy lump of fat. And if your boy is  dull and sleepy, they say that the dullest boys make the cleverest  men--and all the rest of it. I never took any notice of that sort of  clatter--took it for what it was worth; but, all the same, I don't  think I ever saw such a child as Jim was when he turned two. He was  everybody's favourite. They spoilt him rather. I had my own ideas about  bringing up a child. I reckoned Mary was too soft with Jim. She'd say,  'Put that' (whatever it was) 'out of Jim's reach, will you, Joe?' and  I'd say, 'No! leave it there, and make him understand he's not to have  it. Make him have his meals without any nonsense, and go to bed at a  regular hour,' I'd say. Mary and I had many a breeze over Jim. She'd  say that I forgot he was only a baby: but I held that a baby could be  trained from the first week; and I believe I was right.    But, after all, what are you to do? You'll see a boy that was brought up  strict turn out a scamp; and another that was dragged up anyhow (by the  hair of the head, as the saying is) turn out well. Then, again, when  a child is delicate--and you might lose him any day--you don't like to  spank him, though he might be turning out a little fiend, as delicate  children often do. Suppose you gave a child a hammering, and the same  night he took convulsions, or something, and died--how'd you feel about  it? You never know what a child is going to take, any more than you can  tell what some women are going to say or do.    I was very fond of Jim, and we were great chums. Sometimes I'd sit  and wonder what the deuce he was thinking about, and often, the way he  talked, he'd make me uneasy. When he was two he wanted a pipe above all  things, and I'd get him a clean new clay and he'd sit by my side, on the  edge of the verandah, or on a log of the wood-heap, in the cool of the  evening, and suck away at his pipe, and try to spit when he saw me do  it. He seemed to understand that a cold empty pipe wasn't quite the  thing, yet to have the sense to know that he couldn't smoke tobacco  yet: he made the best he could of things. And if he broke a clay pipe  he wouldn't have a new one, and there'd be a row; the old one had to be  mended up, somehow, with string or wire. If I got my hair cut, he'd  want his cut too; and it always troubled him to see me shave--as if he  thought there must be something wrong somewhere, else he ought to have  to be shaved too. I lathered him one day, and pretended to shave him:  he sat through it as solemn as an owl, but didn't seem to appreciate  it--perhaps he had sense enough to know that it couldn't possibly be the  real thing. He felt his face, looked very hard at the lather I scraped  off, and whimpered, 'No blood, daddy!'    I used to cut myself a good deal: I was always impatient over shaving.    Then he went in to interview his mother about it. She understood his  lingo better than I did.    But I wasn't always at ease with him. Sometimes he'd sit looking into  the fire, with his head on one side, and I'd watch him and wonder what  he was thinking about (I might as well have wondered what a Chinaman  was thinking about) till he seemed at least twenty years older than me:  sometimes, when I moved or spoke, he'd glance round just as if to see  what that old fool of a dadda of his was doing now.    I used to have a fancy that there was something Eastern, or  Asiatic--something older than our civilisation or religion--about  old-fashioned children. Once I started to explain my idea to a woman I  thought would understand--and as it happened she had an old-fashioned  child, with very slant eyes--a little tartar he was too. I suppose  it was the sight of him that unconsciously reminded me of my infernal  theory, and set me off on it, without warning me. Anyhow, it got me  mixed up in an awful row with the woman and her husband--and all their  tribe. It wasn't an easy thing to explain myself out of it, and the row  hasn't been fixed up yet. There were some Chinamen in the district.    I took a good-size fencing contract, the frontage of a ten-mile paddock,  near Gulgong, and did well out of it. The railway had got as far as the  Cudgeegong river--some twenty miles from Gulgong and two hundred  from the coast--and 'carrying' was good then. "]]]
