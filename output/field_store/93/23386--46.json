'Tis thirty--_can't_ be thirty years,      Since last I stood upon this plank.    Which o'er the brook its figure rears,      And watch'd the pebbles as they sank?    How white the stream! I still remember    Its margin glassed by hoar December,    And how the sun fell on the snow:    Ah! can it be so long ago?      It cometh back;--so blithe, so bright,      It hurries to my eager ken.    As though but one short winter's night      Had darkened o'er the world since then.    It is the same clear dazzling scene;--    Perhaps the grass is scarce as green;    Perhaps the river's troubled voice    Doth not so plainly say--\"Rejoice.\"      Yet Nature surely never ranges,      Ne'er quits her gay and flowery crown;--    But, ever joyful, merely changes      The primrose for the thistle-down.    'Tis _we_ alone who, waxing old,    Look on her with an aspect cold,    Dissolve her in our burning tears,    Or clothe her with the mists of years!      Then, why should not the grass be green?      And why should not the river's song    Be merry,--as they both have been      When I was here an urchin strong?      Ah, true--too true! I see the sun    Through thirty winter years hath run.    For grave eyes, mirrored in the brook,    Usurp the urchin's laughing look!      So be it! I have lost,--and won!      For, once, the past was poor to me,--    The future dim: and though the sun      Shed life and strength, and I was free,    I _felt_ not--_knew_ no grateful pleasure:    All seemed but as the common measure:    But NOW--the experienced spirit old    Turns all the leaden past to gold.           *       *       *       *       *      FRENCH MANNERS.      (The Duchess of Abrantes, in her recently published Memoirs, gives a  striking picture of the difference in the fashions and habits of living  which has resulted from the old French Revolution.)    Transported from Corsica to Paris at the close of the reign of Louis  XV., my mother had imbibed a second nature in the midst of the luxuries  and excellencies of that period. We flatter ourselves that we have  gained much by our changes in that particular; but we are quite wrong.  Forty thousand livres a-year fifty years ago, would have commanded more  luxury than two hundred thousand now. The elegancies that at that period  surrounded a woman of fashion cannot be numbered; a profusion of  luxuries were in common use, of which even the name is now forgotten.  The furniture of her sleeping apartment--the bath in daily use--the  ample folds of silk and velvet which covered the windows--the perfumes  which filled the room--the rich laces and dresses which adorned the  wardrobe, were widely different from the ephemeral and insufficient  articles by which they have been replaced. My opinion is daily receiving  confirmation, for every thing belonging to the last age is daily coming  again into fashion, and I hope soon to see totally expelled all those  fashions of Greece and Rome, which did admirably well under the climate  of Rome or Messina, but are ill adapted for our _vent du bize_ and  cloudy atmosphere. A piece of muslin suspended on a gilt rod, is really  of no other use but to let a spectator see that he is behind the  curtain. It is the same with the imitation tapestry--the walls six  inches thick, which neither keep out the heat in summer, nor the cold in  winter. All the other parts of modern dress and furniture are comprised  in my anathema, and will always continue to be so.    It is said that every thing is simplified and brought down to the reach  of the most moderate fortunes. That is true in one sense; that is to  say, our confectioner has muslin curtains and gilt rods at his windows,  and his wife has a silk cloak as well as ourselves, because it is become  so thin that it is indeed accessible to every one, but it keeps no one  warm. It is the same with all the other stuffs. We must not deceive  ourselves; we have gained nothing by all these changes. Do not say, \"So  much the better, this is equality.\" By no means; equality is not to be  found here, any more than it is in England, or America, or anywhere,  since it cannot exist. The consequence of attempting it is, that you  will have bad silks, bad satins, bad velvets, and that is all.    The throne of fashion has encountered during the Revolution another  throne, and it has been shattered in consequence. The French people,  amidst their dreams of equality, have lost their own hands. The large  and soft arm-chairs, the full and ample draperies, the cushions of eider  down, all the other delicacies which we alone understood of all the  European family, led only to the imprisonment of their possessors; and  if you had the misfortune to inhabit a spacious hotel, within a court,  to avoid the odious noise and smells of the street, you had your throat  cut. That mode of treating elegant manners put them out of fashion; they  were speedily abandoned, and the barbarity of their successors still so  lingers amongst us, that every day you see put into the lumber-room an  elegant Grecian chair which has broken your arm, and canopies which  smell of the stable, because they are stuffed with hay.    At that time, (1801,) the habits of good company were not yet extinct in  Paris; of the _old_ company of France, and not of what is _now_ termed  good company, and which prevailed 30 years ago only among postilions and  stable-boys. At that period, men of good birth _did not smoke in the  apartments of their wives_, because they felt it to be a dirty and  disgusting practice; they _generally washed their hands_; when they went  out to dine, or to pass the evening in a house of their acquaintance,  they _bowed to the lady at its head in entering and retiring_, and did  not appear so abstracted in their thoughts as to behave as they would  have done in an hotel. They were then careful _not to turn their back on  those with whom they conversed_, so as to show only an ear or the point  of a nose to those whom they addressed. They spoke of something else,  besides those eternal politics on which no two can ever agree, and which  give occasion only to the interchange of bitter expressions. There has  sprung from these endless disputes, disunion in families, the  dissolution of the oldest friendships, and the growth of hatred which  will continue till the grave. Experience proves that in these contests  no one is ever convinced, and that each goes away more than ever  persuaded of the truth of his own opinions.    The customs of the world now give me nothing but pain. From the bosom of  the retirement where I have been secluded for these 15 years, I can  judge, without prepossession, of the extraordinary revolution in manners  which has lately taken place. Old impressions are replaced, it is said,  by new ones; that is all. Are, then, the new ones superior? I cannot  believe it. Morality itself is rapidly undergoing dissolution--every  character is contaminated, and no one knows from whence the poison is  inhaled. Young men now lounge away their evenings in the box of a  theatre, or the Boulevards, or carry on elegant conversation with a fair  seller of gloves and perfumery, make compliments on her lily and  vermilion cheeks, and present her with a _cheap_ ring, accompanied with  a gross and indelicate compliment. Society is so disunited, that it is  daily becoming more vulgar, in the literal sense of the word. Whence any  improvement is to arise, God only knows.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.             *       *       *       *       *    CURRAN AND THE MASTIFF.    Curran told me, with infinite humour of an adventure between him and a  mastiff when he was a boy. He had heard somebody say that any person  throwing the skirts of his coat over his head, stooping low, holding out  his arms and creeping along backward, might frighten the fiercest dog  and put him to flight. He accordingly made the attempt on a miller's  animal in the neighbourhood, who _would never let_ the boys _rob the  orchard_; but found to his sorrow that he had a dog to deal with who did  not care which end of a boy went foremost, so as he could get a good  bite out of it. \"I pursued the instructions,\" said Curran; \"and, as I  had no eyes save those in front, fancied the mastiff was in full  retreat: but I was confoundedly mistaken; for at the very moment I  thought myself victorious, the enemy attacked my rear, and having got a  reasonably good mouthful out of it, was fully prepared to take another  before I was rescued. Egad, I thought for a time the beast had devoured  my entire _centre of gravity_, and that I never should go on a steady  perpendicular again.\" \"Upon my word, Curran,\" said I, \"the mastiff may  have left you your _centre_, but he could not have left much _gravity_  behind him, among the bystanders.\"--_Sir Jonah Barrington._    _Bishop Ken._--This English prelate died as he was on a journey to Bath,  in March, 1710, in the seventy-fourth year of his age. He had been in  the habit of travelling many years with his shroud in his portmanteau,  which he always put on when attacked by illness; of this he gave notice  the day before his death, in order to prevent his body from being  stripped.

The draught of the two currents having been effected through the  conical form of the upper part of the chimney, it remained to regulate the  entrance of the external current into the flame. If this current should  enter the latter at too sharp an angle, it would carry it toward the mouth  of the chimney before the chemical combustion of the carbon and oxygen was  finished; and if, on the contrary, it should traverse it at too obtuse an  angle, it would depress and contract it. Experience has shown that in the  majority of cases the most favorable angle at which the external current  of air can be led into the flame varies between 35 deg. and 45 deg.. We say in the  majority of cases, for there are exceptions; this depends upon the  combustive materials and upon the conditions under which they enter the  flame. The annexed figure shows the form adopted by the inventor for oil  and kerosene lamps. As may be seen, the chimney consists of two cones, A  and B, connected end to end by their small bases. The upper one, A, or  divergent cone, is constructed according to a variable angle, but one  which, in order to produce its maximum effect, ought not to differ much  from 5 deg.. This cone rests upon the convergent one, B, whose angle, as we  have said, varies between 35 deg. and 45 deg.. To the large base of this cone  there is soldered a cylindrical part, c, designed for fixing the chimney  to the holder. The height given the divergent cone is likewise variable,  but a very beautiful light is obtained, when it is equal to six times the  diameter of the contracted part. When the lamp is designed to be used in a  still atmosphere, free from abrupt currents of air, the height may be  reduced to four times the diameter of the base, without the light being  thereby rendered any the less bright. As for the height to be given the  convergent cone, B, that is determined by the opening of the angle  according to which it has been constructed. Finally, as a general thing,  the diameter of the small base should be equal to half the large base of  the convergent cone, B.    The new chimney should be placed upon the holder in such a way that the  upper part of the wick tube, D, is a few millimeters beneath the base of  the convergent cone. The height to be given the wick varies according to  the lamp used. It is regulated so as to obtain a steady and regular  combustion. In oil lamps it must project about 11/2 centimeters. If two  lamps of the same size be observed, one of which is fitted with the new  chimney and the other with the old style, we shall be struck with the  difference that exists in the color of the flame as well as in its  intensity. While in the case of the cylindrical glass the flame is red and  dull, in that of the circuit it is white and very bright. This, however,  is not surprising when we reflect upon the theoretical conditions upon  which the construction of the new chimney is based--the strong influx of  air having the result of causing a more active combustion of the liquid,  and consequently of raising to white heat the particles of carbon  disseminated through the flame. As it was of interest to ascertain what  the increase of illuminating power was in a given lamp provided with the  new chimney, Mr. Felix le Blanc undertook some photometric experiments.  The trials were made with a Gagneau lamp provided with a chimney of the  ordinary shape, and then with one of Mr. Bayle's. The measurements were  made after each had been burned half an hour. The light of the standard  Carcel lamp being 1, there was obtained with the Gagneau lamp with the  ordinary chimney 1.113 carcels, and with the Bayle chimney 1.404 carcels.  Thus 1.113:1.404 represents the ratio of the same lamp with the ordinary  chimney and with that of Bayle. Whence it follows that the light of the  lamp with the old chimney being 1, that with the new one is 1.26, say an  increase of about 25 per cent. There is nothing absolute about this  figure, however. On kerosene lamps the new chimney, compared with the  contracted Prussian one, gives an increase of 40 per cent. in illuminating  power, and the oil is burned without odor or smoke.    As it was of interest to see whether this increase in intensity was not  due to a greater consumption of oil, a determination was made of the  quantity of the latter consumed per hour. The Gagneau lamp, with the old  chimney, burned 62.25 grammes per hour, and with the Bayle 63 grammes in  the same length of time.    It may be concluded, then, that the increase in light is due to the  special form given the chimney. This new burner is applicable to gas lamps  as well as to oil and petroleum ones.    The effects obtained by the new chimney may be summed up as follows:  increase in illuminating power, as a natural result of a better  combustion; suppression of smoke; and a more active combustion, which  dries the carbon of the wick and thus facilitates the ascent of the oil.  The velocity of the current of air likewise facilitates the action of  capillarity by carrying the oil to the top of the wick. Moreover, the  great influx of air under the flame continually cools the base of the  chimney as well as the wick tube, and the result is that the excess of oil  falls limpid and unaltered into the reservoir, and produces none of those  gummy deposits that soil the external movements and clog up the conduits  through which the oil ascends. Finally, the influx of air produced by this  chimney permits of burning, without smoke and without charring the wick,  those oils of poor quality that are unfortunately too often met with in  commerce.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          MODERN LOCOMOTIVE PRACTICE.    [Footnote: Paper read before the Civil and Mechanical Engineers' Society,  April 2, 1884.]    By H. MICHELL WHITLEY, Assoc. M.I.C.E., F.G.S.      A little more than half a century ago, but yet at a period not so far  distant as to be beyond the remembrance of many still living, a  clear-headed North-countryman, on the banks of the Tyne, was working out,  in spite of all opposition, the great problem of adapting the steam engine  to railway locomotion. Buoyed up by an almost prophetic confidence in his  ultimate triumph over all obstacles, he continued to labor to complete an  invention which promised the grandest benefits to mankind. What was  thought of Stephenson and his schemes may be judged by the following  extracts from the _Quarterly Review_ of 1825, in which the introduction of  locomotive traction is condemned in the most pointed manner:    \"As to those persons who speculate on making railways general throughout  the kingdom, and superseding every other mode of conveyance by land and  water, we deem them and their visionary schemes unworthy of notice.... The  gross exaggeration of the locomotive steam engine may delude for a time,  but must end in the mortification of all concerned.... It is certainly  some consolation to those who are to be whirled, at the rate of 18 or 20  miles per hour, by means of a high-pressure engine, to be told that they  are in no danger of being sea-sick while on shore, that they are not to be  scalded to death or drowned by the bursting of a boiler, and that they  need not mind being shot by the shattered fragments, or dashed in pieces  by the flying off or breaking of a wheel. But with all these assurances,  we would as soon expect the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be  fired off upon one of Congreve's ricochet rockets, as trust themselves to  the mercy of such a machine going at such a rate.\"    These words, strange and ludicrous as they seem to us, but tersely  expressed the general opinion of the day; but fortunately the clear head  and the undaunted will persevered, until success was at last attained, and  the magnificent railway system of the present, which has revolutionized  the world, is the issue. And the results are almost overwhelming in their  magnitude. Here, in Great Britain alone, 654,000,000 people travel  annually. There are 14,000 locomotives, and the rolling stock would form a  train nearly 2,000 miles long; while the number of miles traveled in a  year by trains is more than 10,000 times round the world; and the  passengers would form a procession 100 abreast, a yard apart, and 3,700  miles long.    These stupendous results have been attained gradually; if we go back to  1848, we find that on the London and Birmingham Railway the number of  trains in and out of Euston was forty-four per day. The average weight of  the engines was 18 tons, and the gross loads were, for passenger trains 76  tons, and for goods 160. Now, the weight of an express engine and tender  is about 65 tons, and gross loads of 250 to 300 tons for an express, and  500 tons for a coal train are not uncommon, while not only have the trains  materially increased in weight, owing to the carriage of third-class  passengers by all (except a few special) trains, and also to the lowering  of fares and consequent more frequent traveling, but the speed, and  therefore the duty of the engines, is greatly enhanced. A \"Bradshaw's  Guide\" of thirty-five years ago is now a rare book, but it is very  interesting to glance over its pages, and in doing so it will be found  that the fastest speed in all cases but one falls far short of that which  obtains at present. The following table will show what the alteration has  been:    _________________________________________________________________                                           |   1849.   |   1884.   |                                           |Speed miles|Speed miles|                                           | per hour. | per hour. |  -----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+  Great Western--London to Didcot.         |    56     |    --     |        \"           \"   to Swindon.        |    --     |    53    "]]]
