Then she will have her husband's interest truly at heart;  will study to spend his money carefully, and to the best advantage;  and she herself, even, will be surprised at the many economies which  will suggest themselves to save his hard-earned money when she handles  that money herself, which certainly teaches her the saving habit and  the value of money.    \"The majority of housewives of today aren't naturally inclined to be  extravagant or careless. It is rather that they lack the knowledge and  experience of spending money, and spending it to the best advantage  for themselves and their household needs.    \"'Tis a compulsory law in England, I have heard, to allow a wife pin  money, according to a man's means. 'Tis a most wise law. To a loyal  wife and mother it gives added force, dignity and usefulness to have a  sufficient allowance and to be allowed unquestioningly to spend that  money to her best ability. Her husband, be he a working or  professional man, would find it greatly to his advantage in the home  as well as in his business and less of a drain on his bank account  should he give his wife a suitable allowance and trust her to spend it  according to her own intelligence and thrift.    \"Child, many a man is violently prejudiced against giving a young wife  money; many allow her to run up bills, to her hurt and to his, rather  than have her, even in her household expenditure, independent of his  supervision. I sincerely hope, dear, that your intended, Ralph  Jackson, will be superior to this male idiosyncrasy, to term it  mildly, and allow you a stated sum monthly. The home is the woman's  kingdom, and she should be allowed to think for it, to buy for it, and  not to be cramped by lack of money to do as she thinks best for it.\"    \"But, Aunt Sarah, some housewives are so silly that husbands cannot  really be blamed for withholding money from them and preventing them  from frittering it away in useless extravagance.\"    \"Mary, wise wives should not suffer for those who are silly and  extravagant. I don't like to be sarcastic, but with the majority of  the men, silliness appeals to them more than common sense. Men like to  feel their superiority to us. However, though inexperienced, Mary, you  aren't silly or extravagant, and Ralph could safely trust you with his  money. It makes a woman so self-respecting, puts her on her mettle, to  have money to do as she pleases with, to be trusted, relied upon as a  reasoning, responsible being. A man, especially a young husband, makes  a grave mistake when he looks upon his wife as only a toy to amuse  him in his leisure moments and not as one to be trusted to aid him in  his life work. A trusted young housewife, with a reasonable and  regular allowance at her command, be she ever so inexperienced, will  soon plan to have wholesome, nutritious food at little cost, instead  of not knowing until a half hour before meal time what she will serve.  She would save money and the family would be better nourished;  nevertheless, I would impress it on the young housewife not to be too  saving or practice too close economy, especially when buying milk and  eggs, as there is nothing more nutritious or valuable. A palatable  macaroni and cheese; eggs or a combination of eggs and milk, are  dishes which may be substituted occasionally, at less expense, for  meat. A pound of macaroni and cheese equals a pound of steak in food  value. Take time and trouble to see that all food be well cooked and  served, both in an attractive and appetizing manner. Buy the cheaper  cuts of stewing meats, and by long, slow simmering, they will become  sweet and tender and of equal nutritive value as higher priced  sirloins and tenderloins.    \"But, Mary, I've not yet finished that trunk and its contents. That  slightly-faded pink chambray I'll cut up into quilt blocks. Made up  with white patches, and quilted nicely, a pretty quilt lined with  white, will be evolved. I have such a pretty design of pink and white  called the 'Winding Way,' very simple to make. The beauty of the quilt  consists altogether in the manner in which the blocks are put  together, or it might be made over the pattern called 'The Flying  Dutchman.' From that tan linen skirt may be made a laundry bag, shoe  pocket, twine bag, a collar bag and a table runner, the only expense  being several skeins of green embroidery silk, and a couple yards of  green cord to draw the bags up with, and a couple of the same-hued  skirt braids for binding edges, and,\" teasingly, \"Mary, you might  embroider Ralph Jackson's initials on the collar and laundry bag.\"    [Illustration:    A-12 Pine Tree Quilt  A-13 Tree of Life  A-14 Pineapple  A-15 Enlarged Block of Winding Way Quilt  A-16 Lost Rose in the Wilderness  A-17 Tree Quilt]    Mary blushed rosily red and exclaimed in an embarrassed manner, most  bewitchingly, \"Oh!\"    Aunt Sarah laughed. She thought to have Mary look that way 'twas worth  teasing her.    \"Well, Mary, we can in leisure moments, from that coarse, white linen  skirt which you have discarded, make bureau scarfs, sideboard cover,  or a set of scalloped table mats to place under hot dishes on your  dining-room table. I will give you pieces of asbestos to slip between  the linen mats when finished. They are a great protection to the  table. You could also make several small guest towels with deep,  hemstitched ends with your initials on. You embroider so beautifully,  and the drawn work you do is done as expertly as that of the Mexican  women.\"    \"Oh, Aunt Sarah, how ingenious you are.\"    \"And, Mary, your rag carpet shall not be lacking. We shall tear up  those partly-worn muslin skirts into strips one-half inch in width,  and use the dyes left over from dyeing Easter eggs. I always save the  dye for this purpose, they come in such pretty, bright colors. The  rags, when sewed together with some I have in the attic, we'll have  woven into a useful carpet for the home you are planning.'    \"Oh! Aunt Sarah,\" exclaimed Mary, \"do you mean a carpet like the one  in the spare bedroom?\"    \"Yes, my dear, exactly like that, if you wish.\"    \"Indeed I do, and I think one like that quite good enough to have in a  dining-room. I think it so pretty. It does not look at all like a  common rag carpet.\"    \"No, my dear, it is nothing very uncommon. It is all in the way it is  woven. Instead of having two gay rainbow stripes about three inches  wide running through the length of the carpet, I had it woven with the  ground work white and brown chain to form checks. Then about an inch  apart were placed two threads of two shades of red woolen warp,  alternating with two threads of two shades of green, across the whole  width, running the length of the carpet. It has been greatly admired,  as it is rather different from that usually woven. All the rag carpets  I found in the house when we moved here, made by John's mother,  possessed very wide stripes of rainbow colors, composed of shaded  reds, yellows, blues and greens. You can imagine how very gorgeous  they were, and so very heavy. Many of the country weavers use linen  chain or warp instead of cotton, and always use wool warp for the  stripes.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, I want something so very much for the Colonial bedroom I  should like to have when I have a home of my very own.\"    \"What is it, dear? Anything, e'en to the half of my kingdom,\"  laughingly replied her Aunt.    \"Why, I'd love to have several rag rugs like those in your bedroom,  which you call 'New Colonial' rugs.\"    \"Certainly, my dear. They are easily made from carpet rags. I have  already planned in my mind a pretty rag rug for you, to be made from  your old, garnet merino shirtwaist, combined with your discarded  cravenette stormcoat.    \"And you'll need some pretty quilts, also,\" said her Aunt.    \"I particularly admire the tree quilts,\" said Mary.    \"You may have any one you choose; the one called 'Tree of Paradise,'  another called 'Pineapple Design,' which was originally a border to  'Fleur de lis' quilt or 'Pine Tree,' and still another called 'Tree of  Life,' and 'The Lost Rose in the Wilderness.'\"    \"They are all so odd,\" said Mary, \"I scarcely know which one I think  prettiest.\"    \"All are old-fashioned quilts, which I prize highly,\" continued her  Aunt. \"Several I pieced together when a small girl, I think old-time  patchwork too pretty and useful an accomplishment to have gone out of  fashion.    \"You shall have a small stand cover like the one you admired so  greatly, given me by Aunt Cornelia. It is very simple, the materials  required being a square of yard-wide unbleached muslin. In the centre  of this baste a large, blue-flowered handkerchief with cream-colored  ground, to match the muslin. Turn up a deep hem all around outside  edge; cut out quarter circles of the handkerchief at each of four  corners; baste neatly upon the muslin, leaving a space of muslin the  same width as the hem around each quarter circle; briarstitch all  turned-in edges with dark-blue embroidery silk, being washable, these  do nicely as covers for small tables or stands on the veranda in  Summertime.\"    \"Aunt Sarah,\" ecstatically exclaimed Mary, \"you are a wizard to plan  so many useful things from a trunk of apparently useless rags. What a  treasure Uncle has in you. I was fretting about having so little to  make my home attractive, but I feel quite elated at the thought of  having a carpet and rugs already planned, besides the numerous other  things evolved from your fertile brain.\"    Aunt Sarah loved a joke. She held up an old broadcloth cape. \"Here is  a fine patch for Ralph Jackson's breeches, should he ever become  sedentary and need one.\"    Mary reddened and looked almost offended and was at a loss for a  reply.

We had, however, experienced a great deal of  kindness from those around us, and, though perfect strangers, had tasted  some of the hospitality for which this city has often been celebrated. I  omitted, in my former letter, telling you how we formed an acquaintance  with a highly respectable merchant in this place, who afforded us a  great deal of useful information, and introduced us to his wife, a very  elegant and accomplished young woman. During our short acquaintance, we  passed some pleasant hours at their house, much to our satisfaction.    I enjoyed the fresh breeze from the river along the banks of which our  road lay. It was a fine sight to see the unclouded sun rising from  behind the distant chain of mountains. Below us lay the rapids in their  perturbed state, and there was the island of St. Anne's, bringing to our  minds Moore's Canadian boat song: \"We'll sing at Saint Anne's our  parting hymn.\"    The bank of the St. Laurence, along which our road lay, is higher here  than at Montreal, and clothed with brushwood on the summit, occasionally  broken with narrow gulleys. The soil, as near as I could see, was sandy  or light loam. I noticed the wild vine for the first time twining among  the saplings. There were raspberry bushes, too, and a profusion of that  tall yellow flower we call Aaron's golden rod, a _solidago_, and the  white love-everlasting, the same that the chaplets are made of by the  French and Swiss girls to adorn the tombs of their friends, and which  they call _immortelle_; the Americans call it life-everlasting; also a  tall purple-spiked valerian, that I observed growing in the fields among  the corn, as plentiful as the bugloss is in our light sandy fields in  England.    At Lachine we quitted the stage and went on board a steamer, a fine  vessel elegantly fitted up with every accommodation. I enjoyed the  passage up the river exceedingly, and should have been delighted with  the journey by land had not my recent illness weakened me so much that I  found the rough roads very unpleasant. As to the vehicle, a Canadian  stage, it deserves a much higher character than travellers have had the  candour to give it, and is so well adapted for the roads over which it  passes that I doubt if it could be changed for a more suitable one. This  vehicle is calculated to hold nine persons, three back, front, and  middle; the middle seat, which swings on broad straps of leather; is by  far the easiest, only you are liable to be disturbed when any of the  passengers choose to get out.    Certainly the travelling is arranged with as little trouble to the  traveller as possible. Having paid your fare to Prescott you have no  thought or care. When you quit the steam-boat you find a stage ready to  receive you and your luggage, which is limited to a certain proportion.  When the portage is passed (the land carriage), you find a steam-vessel  ready, where you have every accommodation. The charges are not  immoderate, considering the comforts you enjoy.    In addition to their own freight, the steamers generally tow up several  other vessels. We had three Durham boats at one time, beside some other  small craft attached to us, which certainly afforded some variety, if  not amusement.    With the exception of Quebec and Montreal, I must give the preference to  the Upper Province. If not on so grand a scale, the scenery is more  calculated to please, from the appearance of industry and fertility it  displays. I am delighted, in travelling along the road, with the  neatness, cleanliness, and comfort of the cottages and farms. The log-  house and shanty rarely occur, having been supplanted by pretty frame  houses, built in a superior style, and often painted white-lead colour  or a pale pea-green. Around these habitations were orchards, bending  down with a rich harvest of apples, plums, and the American crab, those  beautiful little scarlet apples so often met with as a wet preserve  among our sweetmeats at home.    You see none of the signs of poverty or its attendant miseries. No  ragged, dirty, squalid children, dabbling in mud or dust; but many a  tidy, smart-looking lass was spinning at the cottage-doors, with bright  eyes and braided locks, while the younger girls were seated on the green  turf or on the threshold, knitting and singing as blithe as birds.    There is something very picturesque in the great spinning-wheels that  are used in this country for spinning the wool, and if attitude were to  be studied among our Canadian lasses, there cannot be one more becoming,  or calculated to show off the natural advantages of a fine figure, than  spinning at the big wheel. The spinster does not sit, but walks to and  fro, guiding the yarn with one hand while with the other she turns the  wheel.    I often noticed, as we passed by the cottage farms, hanks of yarn of  different colours hanging on the garden or orchard fence to dry; there  were all manner of colours, green, blue, purple, brown, red, and white.  A civil landlady, at whose tavern we stopped to change horses, told me  these hanks of yarn were first spun and then dyed by the good wives,  preparatory to being sent to the loom. She showed me some of this home-  spun cloth, which really looked very well. It was a dullish dark brown,  the wool being the produce of a breed of black sheep. This cloth is made  up in different ways for family use.    \"Every little dwelling you see,\" said she, \"has its lot of land, and,  consequently, its flock of sheep; and, as the children are early taught  to spin, and knit, and help dye the yarn, their parents can afford to  see them well and comfortably clothed.    \"Many of these very farms you now see in so thriving a condition were  wild land thirty years ago, nothing but Indian hunting-grounds. The  industry of men, and many of them poor men, that had not a rood of land  of their own in their own country, has effected this change.\"    I was much gratified by the reflection to which this good woman's  information gave rise. \"We also are going to purchase wild land, and why  may not we see our farm, in process of time,\" thought I, \"equal these  fertile spots. Surely this is a blessed country to which we have  emigrated,\" said I, pursuing the pleasing idea, \"where every cottage  abounds with the comforts and necessaries of life.\"    I perhaps overlooked at that time the labour, the difficulties, the  privations to which these settlers had been exposed when they first came  to this country. I saw it only at a distance of many years, under a high  state of cultivation, perhaps in the hands of their children or their  children's children, while the toil-worn parent's head was low in the  dust.    Among other objects my attention was attracted by the appearance of open  burying-grounds by the roadside. Pretty green mounds, surrounded by  groups of walnut and other handsome timber trees, contained the graves  of a family, or may be, some favoured friends slept quietly below the  turf beside them. If the ground was not consecrated, it was hallowed by  the tears and prayers of parents and children.    These household graves became the more interesting to me on learning  that when a farm is disposed of to a stranger, the right of burying  their dead is generally stipulated for by the former possessor.    You must bear with me if I occasionally weary you with dwelling on  trifles. To me nothing that bears the stamp of novelty is devoid of  interest. Even the clay-built ovens stuck upon four legs at a little  distance from the houses were not unnoticed in passing. When there is  not the convenience of one of these ovens outside the dwellings, the  bread is baked in large iron pots--\"_bake-kettles_\" they are termed. I  have already seen a loaf as big as a peck measure baking on the hearth  in one of these kettles, and tasted of it, too; but I think the confined  steam rather imparts a peculiar taste to the bread, which you do not  perceive in the loaves baked in brick or clay ovens. At first I could  not make out what these funny little round buildings, perched upon four  posts, could be; and I took them for bee-hives till I spied a good woman  drawing some nice hot loaves out of one that stood on a bit of waste  land on the roadside, some fifty yards from the cottage.    Besides the ovens every house had a draw-well near it, which differed in  the contrivance for raising the water from those I had seen in the old  country. The plan is very simple:--a long pole, supported by a post,  acts as a lever to raise the bucket, and the water can be raised by a  child with very trifling exertion. This method is by many persons  preferred to either rope or chain, and from its simplicity can be  constructed by any person at the mere trouble of fixing the poles. I  mention this merely to show the ingenuity of people in this country, and  how well adapted all their ways are to their means*. [* The plan is  pursued in England and elsewhere, and may be seen in the market-gardens  on the western suburb of London. It can only be done when the water is  near the surface.]    We were exceedingly gratified by the magnificent appearance of the  rapids of the St. Laurence, at the cascades of which the road commanded  a fine view from the elevation of the banks. I should fail in my attempt  to describe this grand sheet of turbulent water to you. Howison has  pictured them very minutely in his work on Upper Canada, which I know  you are well acquainted with. I regretted that we could not linger to  feast our eyes with a scene so wild and grand as the river here appears;  but a Canadian stage waits for no one, so we were obliged to content  ourselves with a passing sight of these celebrated rapids.    We embarked at Couteau du Lac and reached Cornwall late the same  evening. Some of the"]]]
