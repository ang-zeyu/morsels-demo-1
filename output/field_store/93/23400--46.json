What Bohemond, during the first crusade, had proposed to Godfrey de  Bouillon, and what the Bishop of Langres, during the second, had  suggested to Louis the Young, namely, the capture of Constantinople for  the sake of insuring that of Jerusalem, the first crusaders of the  thirteenth century were led by bias, greed, anger, and spite to take in  hand and accomplish; they conquered Constantinople, and, having once made  that conquest, they troubled themselves no more about Jerusalem.  Founded, May 16th, 1204, in the person of Baldwin IX., Count of Flanders,  the Latin empire of the East existed for seventy years, in the teeth of  many a storm, only to fall once more, in 1273, into the hands of the  Greek emperors, overthrown in 1453 by the Turks, who are still in  possession.    One circumstance, connected rather with literature than politics, gives  Frenchmen a particular interest in this conquest of the Greek empire by  the Latin Christians; for it was a Frenchman, Geoffrey de Villehardouin,  seneschal of Theobald III., Count of Champagne, who, after having been  one of the chief actors in it, wrote the history of it; and his work,  strictly historical as to facts, and admirably epic in description of  character and warmth of coloring, is one of the earliest and finest  monuments of French literature.    But to return to the real crusades.    At the beginning of the thirteenth century, whilst the enterprises which  were still called crusades were becoming more and more degenerate in  character and potency, there was born in France, on the 25th of April,  1215, not merely the prince, but the man who was to be the most worthy  representative and the most devoted slave of that religious and moral  passion which had inspired the crusades.  Louis IX., though born to the  purple, a powerful king, a valiant warrior, a splendid knight, and an  object of reverence to all those who at a distance observed his life, and  of affection to all those who approached his person, was neither biassed  nor intoxicated by any such human glories and delights; neither in his  thoughts nor in his conduct did they ever occupy the foremost place;  before all and above all he wished to be, and was indeed, a Christian,  a true Christian, guided and governed by the idea and the resolve of  defending the Christian faith and fulfilling the Christian law.  Had he  been born in the most lowly condition, as the world holds, or, as  religion, the most commanding; had he been obscure, needy, a priest, a  monk, or a hermit, he could not have been more constantly and more  zealously filled with the desire of living as a faithful servant of Jesus  Christ, and of insuring, by pious obedience to God here, the salvation of  his soul hereafter.  This is the peculiar and original characteristic of  St. Louis, and a fact rare and probably unique in the history of kings.  (He was canonized on the 11th of August, 1297; and during twenty-four  years nine successive popes had prosecuted the customary inquiries as to  his faith and life.)    It is said that the Christian enthusiasm of St. Louis had its source in  the strict education he received from Queen Blanche, his mother.  That is  overstepping the limits of that education and of her influence.  Queen  Blanche, though a firm believer and steadfastly pious, was a stranger to  enthusiasm, and too discreet and too politic to make it the dominating  principle of her son's life any more than of her own.  The truth of the  matter is that, by her watchfulness and her exactitude in morals, she  helped to impress upon her son the great Christian lesson of hatred for  sin and habitual concern for the eternal salvation of his soul.  \"Madame  used to say of me,\" Louis was constantly repeating, \"that if I were sick  unto death, and could not be cured save by acting in such wise that I  should sin mortally, she would let me die rather than that I should anger  my Creator to my damnation.\"    [Illustration: ST. LOUIS ADMINISTERING JUSTICE----46]      In the first years of his government, when he had reached his majority,  there was nothing to show that the idea of the crusade occupied Louis  IX.'s mind; and it was only in 1239, when he was now four and twenty,  that it showed itself vividly in him.  Some of his principal vassals, the  Counts of Champagne, Brittany, and Macon, had raised an army of  crusaders, and were getting ready to start for Palestine; and the king  was not contented with giving them encouragement, but \"he desired that  Amaury de Montfort, his constable, should, in his name, serve Jesus  Christ in this war; and for that reason he gave him arms and assigned to  him per day a sum of money, for which Amaury thanked him on his knees,  that is, did him homage, according to the usage of those times.  And the  crusaders were mighty pleased to have this lord with them.\"    Five years afterwards, at the close of 1244, Louis fell seriously ill at  Pontoise; the alarm and sorrow in the kingdom were extreme; the king  himself believed that his last hour was come; and he had all his  household summoned, thanked them for their kind attentions, recommended  them to be good servants of God, \"and did all that a good Christian ought  to do.  His mother, his wife, his brothers, and all who were about him  kept continually praying for him; his mother, beyond all others, adding  to her prayers great austerities.\"  Once he appeared motionless and  breathless; and he was supposed to be dead.  \"One of the dames who were  tending him,\" says Joinville, \"would have drawn the sheet over his face,  saying that he was dead; but another dame, who was on the other side of  the bed, would not suffer it, saying that there was still life in his  body.  When the king heard the dispute between these two dames, our Lord  wrought in him: he began to sigh, stretched his arms and legs, and said,  in a hollow voice, as if he had come forth from the tomb, 'He, by God's  grace, hath visited me, He who cometh from on high, and hath recalled me  from amongst the dead.'  Scarcely had he recovered his senses and speech,  when he sent for William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris, together with  Peter de Cuisy, Bishop of Meaux, in whose diocese he happened to be, and  requested them 'to place upon his shoulder the cross of the voyage over  the sea.'  The two bishops tried to divert him from this idea, and the  two queens, Blanche and Marguerite, conjured him on their knees to wait  till he was well, and after that he might do as he pleased.  He insisted,  declaring that he would take no nourishment till he had received the  cross.  At last the Bishop of Paris yielded, and gave him a cross.  The  king received it with transport, kissing it, and placing it right gently  Upon his breast.\"  \"When the queen, his mother, knew that he had taken  the cross,\" says Joinville, \"she made as great mourning as if she had  seen him dead.\"    Still more than three years rolled by before Louis fulfilled the  engagement which he had thus entered into, with himself alone, one might  say, and against the wish of nearly everybody about him.  The crusades,  although they still remained an object of religious and knightly  aspiration, were from the political point of view decried; and, without  daring to say so, many men of weight, lay or ecclesiastical, had no  desire to take part in them.  Under the influence of this public feeling,  timidly exhibited but seriously cherished, Louis continued, for three  years, to apply himself to the interior concerns of his kingdom and to  his relations with the European powers, as if he had no other idea.  There was a moment when his wisest counsellors and the queen his mother  conceived a hope of inducing him to give up his purpose.  \"My lord king,\"  said one day that same Bishop of Paris, who, in the crisis of his  illness, had given way to his wishes, \"bethink you that, when you  received the cross, when you suddenly and without reflection made this  awful vow, you were weak, and, sooth to say, of a wandering mind, and  that took away from your words the weight of verity and authority.  Our  lord the pope, who knoweth the necessities of your kingdom and your  weakness of body, will gladly grant unto you a dispensation.  Lo! we have  the puissance of the schismatic Emperor Frederick, the snares of the  wealthy King of the English, the treasons but lately stopped of the  Poitevines, and the subtle wranglings of the Albigensians to fear;  Germany is disturbed; Italy hath no rest; the Holy Land is hard of  access; you will not easily penetrate thither, and behind you will be  left the implacable hatred between the pope and Frederick.  To whom will  you leave us, every one of us, in our feebleness and desolation?  \"Queen  Blanche appealed to other considerations, the good counsels she had  always given her son, and the pleasure God took in seeing a son giving  heed to and believing his mother; and to hers she promised, that, if he  would remain, the Holy Land should not suffer, and that more troops  should be sent thither than he could lead thither himself.  The king  listened attentively and with deep emotion.  You say,\" he answered, \"that  I was not in possession of my senses when I took the cross.  Well, as you  wish it, I lay it aside; I give it back to you;\" and raising his hand to  his shoulder, he undid the cross upon it, saying, \"Here it is, my lord  bishop; I restore to you the cross I had put on.\"  All present  congratulated themselves; but the king, with a sudden change of look and  intention, said to them, \"My friends, now, assuredly, I lack not sense  and reason; I am neither weak nor wandering of mind; and I demand my  cross back again.  He who knoweth all things knoweth that until it is  replaced upon my shoulder, no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#8)"],[1,"her knees before the king with the princes and council around him, and  demanded of him justice for her husband's cruel death.  The chancellor  promised justice in the name of the king, who added with his own lips,  \"We regard the deed relating to our own brother as done to ourself.\"  The  compassion of all present was boundless, and so was their indignation;  but it was reported that the Duke of Burgundy was getting ready to return  to Paris, and with what following and for what purpose would he come?  Nothing was known on that point.  There was no force with which to make a  defence.  Nothing was done for the Duchess of Orleans; no prosecution  began.  As much vexed and irritated as disconsolate, she set out for  Blois with her children, being resolved to fortify herself there.  Charles had another relapse of his malady.  The people of Paris, who were  rather favorable than adverse to the Duke of Burgundy, laid the blame of  the king's new attack, and of the general alarm, upon the Duchess of  Orleans, who was off in flight.  John the Fearless actually re-entered  Paris on the 20th of February, 1408, with a thousand men-at-arms, amidst  popular acclamation, and cries of \"Long live the Duke of Burgundy!\"  Having taken up a strong position at the Hotel d'Artois, he sent a demand  to the king for a solemn audience, proclaiming his intention of setting  forth the motives for which he had caused the Duke of Orleans to be  slain.  The 8th of March was the day fixed.  Charles VI., being worse  than ever that day, was not present; the _dauphin_, Louis, Duke of  Guienne, a child of twelve years, surrounded by the princes, councillors,  a great number of lords, doctors of the university, burgesses of note,  and people of various conditions, took his father's place at this  assembly.  The Duke of Burgundy had intrusted a Norman Cordelier, Master  John Petit, with his justification.  The monk spoke for more than five  hours, reviewing sacred history, and the histories of Greece, Rome, and  Persia, and the precedents of Phineas, Absalom the son of David, Queen  Athaliah, and Julian the Apostate, to prove \"that it is lawful, and not  only lawful, but honorable and meritorious, in any subject to slay or  cause to be slain a traitor and disloyal tyrant, especially when he is a  man of such mighty power that justice cannot well be done by the  sovereign.\"  This principle once laid down, John Petit proceeded to apply  it to the Duke of Burgundy, \"causing to be slain that criminal tyrant,  the Duke of Orleans, who was meditating the damnable design of thrusting  aside the king and his children from their crown;\" and he drew from it  the conclusion that \"the Duke of Burgundy ought not to be at all blamed  or censured for what had happened in the person of the Duke of Orleans,  and that the king not only ought not to be displeased with him, but ought  to hold the said lord of Burgundy, as well as his deed, agreeable to him,  and authorized by necessity.\"  The defence thus concluded, letters were  actually put before the king, running thus: \"It is our will and pleasure  that our cousin of Burgundy, his heirs and successors, be and abide at  peace with us and our successors, in respect of the aforesaid deed, and  all that hath followed thereon; and that by us, our said successors, our  people and officers, no hinderance, on account of that, may be offered  them, either now or in time to come.\"    Charles VI., weak in mind and will, even independently of his attacks,  signed these letters, and gave Duke John quite a kind reception, telling  him, however, that \"he could cancel the penalty, but not the resentment  of everybody, and that it was for him to defend himself against perils  which were probably imminent.\"  The duke answered proudly that \"so long  as he stood in the king's good graces, he did not fear any man living.\"    Three days after this strange audience and this declaration, Queen  Isabel, but lately on terms of the closest intimacy with the Duke of  Orleans, who had been murdered on his way home after dining with her, was  filled with alarm, and set off suddenly for Melun, taking with her her  son Louis, the _dauphin_, and accompanied by nearly all the princes, who,  however, returned before long to Paris, being troubled by the displeasure  the Duke of Burgundy testified at their departure.  For more than four  months, Duke John the Fearless remained absolute master of Paris,  disposing of all posts, giving them to his own creatures, and putting  himself on good terms with the university and the principal burgesses.  A serious revolt amongst the Liigese called for his presence in Flanders.  The first troops he had sent against them had been repulsed; and he felt  the necessity of going thither in person.  But two months after his  departure from Paris, on the 26th of August, 1408, Queen Isabel returned  thither from Melun, with the _dauphin_ Louis, who for the first time rode  on horseback, and with three thousand men-at-arms.  She set up her  establishment at the Louvre.  The Parisians shouted \"Noel,\" as she passed  along; and the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Bourbon, the Duke of Brittany,  the constable, and all the great officers of the crown rallied round her.  Two days afterwards, on the 28th of August, the Duchess of Orleans  arrived there from Blois, in a black litter drawn by four horses  caparisoned in black, and followed by a large number of mourning  carriages.  On the 5th of September, a state assembly was held at the  Louvre.  All the royal family, the princes and great officers of the  crown, the presidents of the parliament, fifteen archbishops or bishops,  the provost of Paris, the provost of tradesmen, and a hundred burgesses  of note attended it.  Thereupon Master Juvenal des Ursins, king's  advocate, announced the intention of Charles VI. in his illness to confer  the government upon the queen, set forth the reasons for it, called to  mind the able regency of Queen Blanche, mother of St. Louis, and produced  royal letters, sealed with the great seal.  Immediately the Duchess of  Orleans came forward, knelt at the _dauphin_'s feet, demanding justice  for the death of her husband, and begged that she might have a day  appointed her for refuting the calumnies with which it had been sought to  blacken his memory.  The _dauphin_ promised a speedy reply.  On the 11th  of September, accordingly, a new meeting of princes, lords, prelates,  parliament, the university, and burgesses was held in the great hall of  the Louvre.  The Duchess of Orleans, the Duke her son, their chancellor,  and the principal officers of her household were introduced, and leave  was given them to proceed with the justification of the late Duke of  Orleans.  It had been prepared beforehand; the duchess placed the  manuscript before the council, as pledging herself unreservedly to all it  contained, and Master Serisy, Abbot of St. Fiacre, a monk of the order of  St. Benedict, read the document out publicly.  It was a long and learned  defence, in which the imputations made by the cordelier, John Petit,  against the late Duke of Orleans, were effectually and in some parts  eloquently refuted.  After the justification, Master Cousinot, advocate  of the Duchess of Orleans, presented in person his demands against the  Duke of Burgundy.  They claimed that he should be bound to come, \"without  belt or chaperon,\" and disavow solemnly and publicly, on his knees before  the royal family, and also on the very spot where the crime was  committed, the murder of the Duke of Orleans.  After several other acts  of reparation which were imposed upon him, he was to be sent into exile  for twenty years beyond the seas, and on his return to remain at twenty  leagues' distance, at least, from the king and the royal family.  After  reacting these demands, which were more legitimate than practicable, the  young _dauphin_, well instructed as to what he had to say, addressed the  Duchess of Orleans and her children in these terms: \"We and all the  princes of the blood royal here present, after having heard the  justification of our uncle, the Duke of Orleans, have no doubt left  touching the honor of his memory, and do hold him to be completely  cleared of all that hath been said contrary to his reputation.  As to the  further demands you make, they shall be suitably provided for in course  of justice.\"  At this answer the assembly broke up.    It had just been reported that the Duke of Burgundy had completely beaten  and reduced to submission the insurgent Liegese, and that he was  preparing to return to Paris with his army.  Great was the consternation  amongst the council of the queen and princes.  They feared above  everything to see the king and the _dauphin_ in the Duke of Burgundy's  power; and it was decided to quit Paris, which had always testified a  favorable disposition towards Duke John.  Charles VI. was the first to  depart, on the 3d of November, 1408.  The queen, the _dauphin_, and the  princes followed him two days afterwards, and at Gien they all took boat  on the Loire to go to Tours.  The Duke of Burgundy on his arrival at  Paris, on the 28th of November, found not a soul belonging to the royal  family or the court; and he felt a moment's embarrassment.  Even his  audacity and lack of scruple did not go to the extent of doing without  the king altogether, or even of dispensing with having him for a tool;  and he had seen too much of the Parisian populace not to know how  precarious and fickle was its favor.  He determined to negotiate with the  king's party, and for that purpose he sent his brother-in-law the Count  of Hainault, to Tours, with a brilliant train of unarmed attendants,  bidden to make themselves agreeable, and not to fight.    A recent event had probably much to do with his decision.  His most  indomitable foe, she to whom the king and his councillors had lately  granted a portion of the vengeance she was seeking to"]]]
