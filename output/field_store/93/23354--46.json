Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;      There stays a husband to make you a wife.      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.      Hie you to church; I must another way,      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.      I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;      But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.      Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.      Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene VI.  Friar Laurence's cell.    Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.        Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act      That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!      Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy      That one short minute gives me in her sight.      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,      Then love-devouring death do what he dare-      It is enough I may but call her mine.      Friar. These violent delights have violent ends      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,      Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness      And in the taste confounds the appetite.      Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.                         Enter Juliet.        Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.      A lover may bestride the gossamer      That idles in the wanton summer air,      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.      Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.      Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.      Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.      Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy      Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue      Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both      Receive in either by this dear encounter.      Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,      Brags of his substance, not of ornament.      They are but beggars that can count their worth;      But my true love is grown to such excess      cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.      Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone      Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.                                                         [Exeunt.]          ACT III. Scene I.  A public place.    Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.        Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.      And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.      Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters      the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and      says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the      second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.      Ben. Am I like such a fellow?      Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in      Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be      moved.      Ben. And what to?      Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,      for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a      man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.      Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an      eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels      as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as      addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a      man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog      that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a      tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with      another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt      tutor me from quarrelling!      Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should      buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.      Mer. The fee simple? O simple!                           Enter Tybalt and others.        Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.      Mer. By my heel, I care not.      Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.      Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.      Mer. And but one word with one of us?      Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.      Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me      occasion.      Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving      Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.      Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make      minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my      fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!      Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.      Either withdraw unto some private place      And reason coldly of your grievances,      Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.      Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.      I will not budge for no man's pleasure,                            Enter Romeo.        Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.      Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!      Your worship in that sense may call him man.      Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford      No better term than this: thou art a villain.      Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage      To such a greeting. Villain am I none.      Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.      Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.      Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,      But love thee better than thou canst devise      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;      And so good Capulet, which name I tender      As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.      Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!      Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]      Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?      Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?      Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.  That I      mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,        dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out      of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your      ears ere it be out.      Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]      Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.      Mer. Come, sir, your passado!                                                     [They fight.]      Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.      Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!      Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath      Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.      Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!           Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies                                             [with his Followers].      Mer. I am hurt.      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.      Is he gone and hath nothing?      Ben. What, art thou hurt?      Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.                                                      [Exit Page.]      Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.      Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;      but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you      shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this      world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a      mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,  a      villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil      came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.      Rom. I thought all for the best.      Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!      They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,      And soundly too. Your houses!                                   [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].      Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,      My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt      In my behalf- my reputation stain'd      With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour      Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate      And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel                          Enter Benvolio.        Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!      That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.      Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;      This but begins the woe others must end.                           Enter Tybalt.        Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.      Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?      Away to heaven respective lenity,      And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!      Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul      Is but a little way above our heads,      Staying for thine to keep him company.      Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.      Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,      Shalt with him hence.      Rom. This shall determine that.                                         They fight. Tybalt falls.      Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.      Stand not amaz'd.

That it is German, is precisely why it is not exclusively  German: for in every epoch has it not been proclaimed in accents of  praise or of blame, until we are almost tired of hearing it, that the  inclination to take up and appropriate foreign possessions is peculiar  to the German nation--and to the Germanic spirit in general? Thus we  possess special presentations of German literature considered from the  standpoint of its antique elements, and also from that of its  Christian elements, and we could in the same way present theses which  would show its development from the standpoint of the Romance or of  the English influence. And yet latterly an exactly contrary attempt  has been made--in a spirited, if somewhat arbitrary book by Nadler,  which consists in trying to build up the history of German literature  entirely upon the peculiarities of the different tribes and provinces.  For the essence of the German, nay, even of the Swabian, or Bavarian,  or North German, or Austrian individuality, is in the long run  nourished rather than extinguished by all foreign influences. In spite  of this, it is of course important in the consideration of the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to observe how the French pattern  that is at first followed almost with the unquestioned obedience  accorded to a fixed ethical model, is confronted by the English, which  brings about the celebrated--and probably overrated--struggle between  Gottsched and the Swiss School. We should also notice precisely how  the tendency of British literature toward originality--in which the  insular peculiarities were strongly emphasized--served to increase the  self-reliance of German literature; how a new movement in the style of  the antique was cultivated by the classical writers; and how the  Romantic School favored medieval-Christian tendencies--much to  Goethe's annoyance. It is of importance likewise to note the way in  which Young Germany learned how to gain political-literary effects  from the new French models; and finally, how the Northern realism of  presentation, amalgamated with Tolstoy's, Bjoernson's, Strindberg's and  also Ibsen's ethical subjectivity, educated the naturalism of the  Germans. It is precisely those poets that are especially characterized  by German peculiarities who have also trained themselves in the use of  foreign subjects and forms: thus did Uhland, Moerike, Hebbel, and all  the Romanticists. We have already had occasion many times to call  attention in detail to the educational effect of foreign countries.    German literature is, in short, one that possesses the typical moments  of development which mark all literatures, and which Wilhelm Scherer  was the first to call to our notice: that is to say, it is a  complicated organism in which the most varied tendencies cross one  another, the most dissimilar generations of writers meet together, and  the most remarkable events occur in the most unforeseen manner.    If we should now try to get a closer view of the last and by far the  most important factor of literature, namely, the individual writers  themselves, this difficulty in obtaining a general view of the whole,  this working of the different parts against one another, this pulling  away from one another, presents itself more clearly to us here than  anywhere else. The attempt to classify the development of our  literature into distinct groups according to the personalities which  compose them has been frequently made, since I, in spite of all the  difficulties and dangers of such a hazardous enterprise, first  undertook, in my _German Literature of the Nineteenth Century_, to  give an historical and complete presentation of a literature which had  as yet scarcely become historic. I can here merely refer in passing to  my own efforts and to those of Bartels, Biese, Riemann, and  Soergel--to name only these; for in compliance with the purpose of  this introduction we must confine ourselves to giving a general  comprehensive outline--although it would be easy to improve upon it if  one went more into detail.    It seems to me under these conditions that the groundlines of the  development of our literature from 1700-1900 would be best impressed  upon us by comparing the order of its evolution with that of the most  \"normal\" poetic genius who ever lived--namely, with that of Goethe;  and thereby we should prove its development to be an essentially  normal one.    Like all \"natural geniuses\" Goethe begins as an imitator, dependent  upon others; for the poet also must first learn to speak and to walk.  The earliest literary effort of his which we possess is the poem _On  Christ's Descent into Hell_, which naturally seemed strange enough to  Goethe when this long forgotten first printed specimen of his literary  productiveness was laid before him again after he had grown old. In  this poem traditional phrases are repeated without the addition of  anything new and original; conventional feelings are expressed, usual  methods are employed; all this, however, not without a certain  moderation of expression constituting a first sign of the otherwise  still completely concealed poetic individuality.    Such is the character that the world of virtuosos also bears about the  year 1700. The poems of Rudolf von Canitz and Johann von Besser are,  though in entirely different spheres, just the same kind of first  attempts of an imperfect art anxiously following foreign models as  Goethe's first Christian poem--though truly with the tremendous  difference that they represented the utmost that Frenchified courtly  art could ever attain to; while Goethe's poem, on the contrary, was  the immature sprig cut away before its time from the stem of a tree  soon to stand in the full glory of its bloom.    When now in the Leipzig period the young student discovers the poet  within him, he first does so in the customary way: he recognizes the  ability on his part to handle the language of the contemporary poets,  and also perhaps to imbue it with his own personal feelings. His poems  inserted in letters, which make a show of the elegant pretence of  improvisation, but in reality already display a great dexterity in  rhyming and in the use of imagery, may be compared to Hagedorn's  poetry; but at the same time Goethe is trying to attain the serious  tone of the \"Pindarian\" odes, just as Haller's stilted scholarly  poetry conquered a place beside Hagedorn's Epicurean philosophy of  life. The _Book of Annette_ (1767) as a whole, however, presents the  first attempt on the part of Goethe to reach a certain completeness in  his treatment of the poetic theme. In all his subsequent collections  of poems the same attempt is made, it is true with increasingly rigid  interpretation of the idea of \"completeness,\" and in so far one is  reminded in this connection of the theoretic intentions and  performances of Gottsched.    The \"New Songs\" (_Neue Lieder_) of 1770 give a lop-sided exhibition of  the style which Leipzig and the times acts. Two great acts follow: in  1773 comes _Goetz_; in 1774, _Werther_. And with _Goetz_ the great  \"subjects of humanity\" seize possession of Goethe's poetry, as they  had taken possession of the poetry of Germany with Lessing--as shown  by his whole work up to _Nathan_: for Lessing, the strongest adversary  of mere \"estheticism,\" really accomplished what those Anacreontic  poets had merely wished to do--or seemed to wish--and brought  literature into close touch with life. _The Sorrows of Werther_ lays  hold of the subjective problems of the age just as the drama of  liberty lays hold of the objective; in them a typical character of the  times is analyzed not without zealously making use of models--both  innovations of Wieland! But now indeed comes the most important of  all, that which in its greatness represents something completely new,  although in detail Goethe had here all his teachers to teach  him--Lessing who had written _Faust_-scenes, and Wieland who was so  fond of placing the two souls of man side by side, and Herder who had  an absolutely Faust-like nature; so that people have tried, with the  exaggeration of the theorist, to hold up before us the whole _Faust_  as a kind of dramatized portrayal of Herder! And with _Faust_ Goethe  in German literature has reached his own time--\"For his century bears  his name!\"    But in the period which followed the predominating position of the  classical writers we once more find the same parallelism of  development. Again with Goethe's dilettante beginnings we compare a  school of weak imitators, which unhappily was protected by Goethe  himself (and also by Schiller in his literary organs); again with the  Strassburg period and its Storm and Stress we compare Romanticism,  which is characterized by its German nationalism and its antique  tendencies, which is sentimental and philosophical, critical and  programmatical like the time of _Goetz_, which latter surely must have  had a strong effect on men like Tieck and Arnim. And out of the  sentiment for his country, which, in Goethe's whole literary career,  is peculiar only to the poetry of the Strassburg period, tendencies  develop like those which manifest themselves in the literature of the  Wars of Liberation, of the Swabian School, in the older poetry of  political conflict--in short, like all those tendencies which we  connect with Ludwig Uhland's name.    Goethe's literary satires and poems for special occasions are a  prelude to the purely literary existence and the belligerent spirit of  men like Platen and Immermann, who both, as it were by accident, found  their way into the open of national poesy. The self-absorption in  _Werther_, the delving after new poetical experiences and mediums of  expression; the method of expression hovering between form and  illusory improvisation--all this we find again in the strongest"]]]
