He gave her betel-nut, and they chewed  together, and he said:    \"My name is Kanag and I am the son of Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen.\"    Then the girl said: \"My name is Dapilisan and I am the daughter of  Bangan and Dalonagan.\"    When Dapilisan went home Kanag followed her, and he told her parents  his name and how he had changed into a little bird. And when he had  finished he asked if he might marry their daughter. Bangan and his wife  were greatly pleased that Kanag wanted Dapilisan for his wife, but they  were afraid that his parents might object, so they sent a messenger  to invite Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen to come to visit them.    As soon as Kanag's parents heard that their son had become a man they  were very happy and started at once to go to him, carrying many fine  presents. Before arrangements for the wedding could be made, it was  necessary to decide on the price to be paid for the girl. A long  discussion took place. Bangan and Dalonagan finally said that the  spirit house must be filled nine times with different kinds of jars.    When this was done Dalonagan raised her eyebrows, and half of the  jars disappeared. Aponibolinayen used her magical power and the spirit  house was filled again, and then Dalonagan said to her:    \"Now the web of the spider shall be put around the town and you must  put gold beads on it. If it does not break, Kanag may marry Dapilisan.\"    When Aponibolinayen had put the gold beads on the thread, Dalonagan  hung on it to see if it would hold. As it did not break, she declared  that the sign was good; and Kanag and Dapilisan were married.    Then the people played on the copper gongs, danced, and made merry  for a long time, and when they returned to their homes Kanag and his  bride went with Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen.        The Story of the Tikgi    _Tinguian_      \"Tikgi, tikgi, tikgi, we will come to work for you. Let us cut  your rice.\"    Ligi [65] had gone to the field to look at his growing rice, but when  he heard this sound he looked up and was surprised to see some birds  circling above and calling to him.    \"Why, you cannot cut rice,\" said Ligi. \"You are birds and know only  how to fly.\"    But the birds insisted that they knew how to cut rice; so finally he  told them to come again when the grain was ripe, and they flew away.    No sooner had the birds gone than Ligi was filled with a great desire  to see them again. As he went home he wished over and over that his  rice were ready to cut. As soon as Ligi left the field the tikgi birds  began using magic so that the rice grew rapidly, and five days later  when he returned he found the birds there ready to cut the ripened  grain. Ligi showed them where to begin cutting, and then he left them.    When he was out of sight, the tikgi said to the rice cutters:    \"Rice cutters, you cut the rice alone.\" And to the bands which were  lying nearby they said: \"Bands, you tie into bundles the rice which  the cutters cut\"    And the rice cutters and the bands worked alone, doing as they  were told.    When Ligi went again to the field in the afternoon, the tikgi said:    \"Come, Ligi, and see what we have done, for we want to go home now.\"    Ligi was amazed, for he saw five hundred bundles of rice cut. And  he said:    \"Oh, Tikgi, take all the rice you wish in payment, for I am very  grateful to you.\"    Then the tikgi each took one head of rice, saying it was all they  could carry, and they flew away.    The next morning when Ligi reached the field, he found the birds  already there and he said:    \"Now, Tikgi, cut the rice as fast as you can, for when it is finished  I will make a ceremony for the spirits, and you must come.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the tikgi, \"and now we shall begin the work, but you  do not need to stay here.\"    So Ligi went home and built a rice granary to hold his grain, and when  he returned to the field the rice was all cut. Then the tikgi said:  \"We have cut all your rice, Ligi, so give us our pay, and when you  go home the rice will all be in your granary.\"    Ligi wondered at this, and when he reached home and saw that his  granary was full of rice, he doubted if the tikgi could be real birds.    Not long after this Ligi invited all his relatives from the different  towns to help him make the ceremony for the spirits. [66] As soon  as the people arrived, the tikgi came also; and they flew over the  people's heads and made them drink basi until they were drunk. Then  they said to Ligi:    \"We are going home now; it is not good for us to stay here, for we  cannot sit among the people.\"    When they started home Ligi followed them until they came to the  bana-asi tree, and here he saw them take off their feathers and put  them in the rice granary. Then suddenly they became one beautiful  maiden.    \"Are you not the tikgi who came to cut my rice?\" asked Ligi. \"You  look to me like a beautiful maiden.\"    \"Yes,\" she replied; \"I became tikgi and cut rice for you, for otherwise  you would not have found me.\" Ligi took her back to his house where  the people were making the ceremony, and as soon as they saw her they  began chewing the magic betel-nuts to find who she might be.    The quid [67] of Ebang and her husband and that of the tikgi went  together, so they knew that she was their daughter who had disappeared  from their house one day long ago while they were in the fields. In  answer to their many questions, she told them that she had been in the  bana-asi tree, where Kaboniyan [68] had carried her, until the day that  she changed herself into the tikgi birds and went to the field of Ligi.    Ligi was very fond of the beautiful girl and he asked her parents if  he might marry her. They were very willing and decided on a price he  should pay. After the wedding all the people remained at his house,  feasting and dancing for three months.        The Story of Sayen [69]    _Tinguian_    In the depths of a dark forest where people seldom went, lived a  wizened old Alan. [70] The skin on her wrinkled face was as tough  as a carabao hide, and her long arms with fingers pointing back from  the wrist were horrible to look at. Now this frightful creature had  a son whose name was Sayen, and he was as handsome as his mother was  ugly. He was a brave man, also, and often went far away alone to fight.    On these journeys Sayen sometimes met beautiful girls, and though  he wanted to marry, he could not decide upon one. Hearing that one  Danepan was more beautiful than any other, he determined to go and  ask her to be his wife.    Now Danepan was very shy, and when she heard that Sayen was coming  to her house she hid behind the door and sent her servant, Laey,  out to meet him. And so it happened that Sayen, not seeing Danepan,  married Laey, thinking that she was her beautiful mistress. He took  her away to a house he had built at the edge of the forest, for though  he wished to be near his old home, he dared not allow his bride to  set eyes on his ugly mother.    For some time they lived happily together here, and then one day when  Sayen was making a plow under his house, he heard Laey singing softly  to their baby in the room above, and this is what she sang:    \"Sayen thinks I am Danepan, but Laey I am. Sayen thinks I am Danepan,  but Laey I am.\"    When Sayen heard this he knew that he had been deceived, and he  pondered long what he should do.    The next morning he went to the field to plow, for it was near the  rice-planting time. Before he left the house he called to his wife:    \"When the sun is straight above, you and the baby bring food to me,  for I shall be busy in the field.\"    Before he began to plow, however, he cut the bamboo supports of the  bridge which led to the field, so that when Laey and the baby came  with his food, they had no sooner stepped on the bridge than it went  down with them and they were drowned. Sayen was again free. He took  his spear and his shield and head-ax and went at once to the town of  Danepan, and there he began killing the people on all sides.    Terror spread through the town. No one could stop his terrible work  of destruction until Danepan came down out of her house, and begged  him to spare part of the people that she might have some from whom to  borrow fire. [71] Her great beauty amazed him and he ceased killing,  and asked her to prepare some betel-nut for him to chew, as he was  very tired. She did so, and when he had chewed the nut he spat on  the people he had killed and they came to life again. Then he married  Danepan and took her to his home.    Now it happened about this time that the people of Magosang were  in great trouble. At the end of a successful hunt, while they were  dividing the meat among themselves, the Komow, [72] a murderous spirit  that looks like a man, would come to them and ask how many they had  caught. If they answered, \"Two,\" then he would say that he had caught  two also; and when they went home, they would find two people in the  town dead. As often as they went to hunt the Komow did this, and many  of the people of Magosang were dead and those living were in great  fear. Finally they heard of the brave man, Sayen, and they begged  him to help them. Sayen listened to all they told, and then said:    \"I will go with you to hunt, and while you are dividing the meat,  I will hide behind the trees. When the Komow comes to ask how many  deer you have, he will smell me, but you must say that you do not  know where I am,\"    So the people went to hunt, and when they had killed two deer, they  singed them over a fire and began to divide them. Just then the Komow  arrived and said:    \"How many have you?\"    \"We have two,\" replied the people.    \"I have two also,\" said the Komow, \"but I smell Sayen.\"    \"We do not know where Sayen is,\" answered the people; and just then he  sprang out and killed the Komow, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12815"],[0,"American Cookery: The Art of Dressing Viands, Fish, Poultry, and Vegetables (#8)"],[1,"st; and when they are of a good colour, and the sirrup will  stand, they are boiled enough.      _To preserve Raspberries_.

Put the fish first into cold water and wash it, then hang it over the  fire and soak it six hours in scalding water, then shift it into clean  warm water, and let it scald for one hour, it will be much better than  to boil.      _To boil all kinds of Garden Stuff_.    In dressing all sorts of kitchen garden herbs, take care they are  clean washed; that there be no small snails, or caterpillars between  the leaves; and that all coarse outer leaves, and the tops that have  received any injury by the weather, be taken off; next wash them in a  good deal of water, and put them into a cullender to drain, care must  likewise be taken, that your pot or sauce pan be clean, well tinned,  and free from sand, or grease.      _To keep Green Peas till Christmas_.
