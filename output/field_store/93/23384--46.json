I want to stand my  trial for murder and defend my own case, and I want to be found by the  eunuchs in the harem of the Shah. I want to dive for pearls and scale  the Matterhorn. I want to know where the tunnel leads to--the tunnel  down under the Great Pyramid of Gizeh--and I'd love to shoot Niagara  Falls in a barrel.\"    \"It sounds characteristic,\" murmured Harley, laying the slip on the  coffee table.    \"It's true!\" declared Brinn. \"I said it and I meant it. I'm a glutton  for danger, Mr. Harley, and I'm going to tell you why. Something  happened to me seven years ago--\"    \"In India?\"    \"In India. Correct. Something happened to me, sir, which just took  the sunshine out of life. At the time I didn't know all it meant. I've  learned since. For seven years I have been flirting with death and  hoping to fall!\"    Harley stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"More than ever I fail to  understand.\"    \"I can only ask you to be patient, Mr. Harley. Time is a wonderful  doctor, and I don't say that in seven years the old wound hasn't healed  a bit. But to-night you have, unknowingly, undone all that time had  done. I'm a man that has been down into hell. I bought myself out. I  thought I knew where the pit was located. I thought I was well away from  it, Mr. Harley, and you have told me something tonight which makes me  think that it isn't where I supposed at all, but hidden down here right  under our feet in London. And we're both standing on the edge!\"    That Nicol Brinn was deeply moved no student of humanity could have  doubted. From beneath the stoic's cloak another than the dare-devil  millionaire whose crazy exploits were notorious had looked out.  Persistently the note of danger came to Paul Harley. Those luxurious  Piccadilly chambers were a focus upon which some malignant will was  concentrated. He became conscious of anger. It was the anger of a just  man who finds himself impotent--the rage of Prometheus bound.    \"Mr. Brinn!\" he cried, \"I accept unreservedly all that you have told me.  Its real significance I do not and cannot grasp. But my theory that Sir  Charles Abingdon was done to death has become a conviction. That a like  fate threatens yourself and possibly myself I begin to believe.\" He  looked almost fiercely into the other's dull eyes. \"My reputation  east and west is that of a white man. Mr. Brinn--I ask you for your  confidence.\"    Nicol Brinn dropped his chin into his hand and resumed that unseeing  stare into the open grate. Paul Harley watched him intently.    \"There isn't any one I would rather confide in,\" confessed the American.  \"We are linked by a common danger. But\"--he looked up--\"I must ask you  again to be patient. Give me time to think--to make plans. For your own  part--be cautious. You witnessed the death of Sir Charles Abingdon. You  don't think and perhaps I don't think that it was natural; but whatever  steps you may have taken to confirm your theories, I dare not hope that  you will ever discover even a ghost of a clue. I simply warn you, Mr.  Harley. You may go the same way. So may I. Others have travelled that  road before poor Abingdon.\"    He suddenly stood up, all at once exhibiting to his watchful visitor  that tremendous nervous energy which underlay his impassive manner.  \"Good God!\" he said, in a cold, even voice. \"To think that it is here in  London. What does it mean?\"    He ceased speaking abruptly, and stood with his elbow resting on a  corner of the mantelpiece.    \"You speak of it being here,\" prompted Harley. \"Is it consistent with  your mysterious difficulties to inform me to what you refer?\"    Nicol Brinn glanced aside at him. \"If I informed you of that,\" he  answered, \"you would know all you want to know. But neither you nor I  would live to use the knowledge. Give me time. Let me think.\"    Silence fell in the big room, Nicol Brinn staring down vacantly into the  empty fireplace, Paul Harley standing watching him in a state of almost  stupefied mystification. Muffled to a soothing murmur the sounds of  Piccadilly penetrated to that curtained chamber which held so many  records of the troubled past and which seemed to be charged with shadowy  portents of the future.    Something struck with a dull thud upon a windowpane--once--twice. There  followed a faint, sibilant sound.    Paul Harley started and the stoical Nicol Brinn turned rapidly and  glanced across the room.    \"What was that?\" asked Harley.    \"I expect--it was an owl,\" answered Brinn. \"We sometimes get them over  from the Green Park.\"    His high voice sounded unemotional as ever. But it seemed to Paul Harley  that his face, dimly illuminated by the upcast light from the lamp upon  the coffee table, had paled, had become gaunt.        CHAPTER VI. PHIL ABINGDON ARRIVES    On the following afternoon Paul Harley was restlessly pacing his private  office when Innes came in with a letter which had been delivered by  hand. Harley took it eagerly and tore open the envelope. A look of  expectancy faded from his eager face almost in the moment that it  appeared there. \"No luck, Innes,\" he said, gloomily. \"Merton reports  that there is no trace of any dangerous foreign body in the liquids  analyzed.\"    He dropped the analyst's report into a wastebasket and resumed his  restless promenade. Innes, who could see that his principal wanted  to talk, waited. For it was Paul Harley's custom, when the clue to a  labyrinth evaded him, to outline his difficulties to his confidential  secretary, and by the mere exercise of verbal construction Harley would  often detect the weak spot in his reasoning. This stage come to, he  would dictate a carefully worded statement of the case to date and thus  familiarize himself with its complexities.    \"You see, Innes,\" he began, suddenly, \"Sir Charles had taken no  refreshment of any kind at Mr. Wilson's house nor before leaving his  own. Neither had he smoked. No one had approached him. Therefore, if he  was poisoned, he was poisoned at his own table. Since he was never out  of my observation from the moment of entering the library up to that of  his death, we are reduced to the only two possible mediums--the soup or  the water. He had touched nothing else.\"    \"No wine?\"    \"Wine was on the table but none had been poured out. Let us see what  evidence, capable of being put into writing, exists to support my theory  that Sir Charles was poisoned. In the first place, he clearly went in  fear of some such death. It was because of this that he consulted me.  What was the origin of his fear? Something associated with the term  Fire-Tongue. So much is clear from Sir Charles's dying words, and his  questioning Nicol Brinn on the point some weeks earlier.    \"He was afraid, then, of something or someone linked in his mind with  the word Fire-Tongue. What do we know about Fire-Tongue? One thing only:  that it had to do with some episode which took place in India. This item  we owe to Nicol Brinn.    \"Very well. Sir Charles believed himself to be in danger from some thing  or person unknown, associated with India and with the term Fire-Tongue.  What else? His house was entered during the night under circumstances  suggesting that burglary was not the object of the entrance. And next?  He was assaulted, with murderous intent. Thirdly, he believed himself to  be subjected to constant surveillance. Was this a delusion? It was  not. After failing several times I myself detected someone dogging my  movements last night at the moment I entered Nicol Brinn's chambers.  Nicol Brinn also saw this person.    \"In short, Sir Charles was, beyond doubt, at the time of his death,  receiving close attention from some mysterious person or persons  the object of which he believed to be his death. Have I gone beyond  established facts, Innes, thus far?\"    \"No, Mr. Harley. So far you are on solid ground.\"    \"Good. Leaving out of the question those points which we hope to clear  up when the evidence of Miss Abingdon becomes available--how did Sir  Charles learn that Nicol Brinn knew the meaning of Fire-Tongue?\"    \"He may have heard something to that effect in India.\"    \"If this were so he would scarcely have awaited a chance encounter to  prosecute his inquiries, since Nicol Brinn is a well-known figure in  London and Sir Charles had been home for several years.\"    \"Mr. Brinn may have said something after the accident and before he was  in full possession of his senses which gave Sir Charles a clue.\"    \"He did not, Innes. I called at the druggist's establishment this  morning. They recalled the incident, of course. Mr. Brinn never uttered  a word until, opening his eyes, he said: 'Hello! Am I much damaged?'\"    Innes smiled discreetly. \"A remarkable character, Mr. Harley,\" he said.  \"Your biggest difficulty at the moment is to fit Mr. Nicol Brinn into  the scheme.\"    \"He won't fit at all, Innes! We come to the final and conclusive item of  evidence substantiating my theory of Sir Charles's murder: Nicol Brinn  believes he was murdered. Nicol Brinn has known others, in his own  words, 'to go the same way.' Yet Nicol Brinn, a millionaire, a scholar,  a sportsman, and a gentleman, refuses to open his mouth.\"    \"He is afraid of something.\"    \"He is afraid of Fire-Tongue--whatever Fire-Tongue may be! I never saw a  man of proved courage more afraid in my life. He prefers to court arrest  for complicity in a murder rather than tell what he knows!\"    \"It's unbelievable.\"    \"It would be, Innes, if Nicol Brinn's fears were personal.\"    Paul Harley checked his steps in front of the watchful secretary and  gazed keenly into his eyes.    \"Death has no terrors for Nicol Brinn,\" he said slowly. \"All his life  he has toyed with danger. He admitted to me that during the past seven  years he had courted death. Isn't it plain enough, Innes? If ever a man  possessed all that the world had to offer, Nicol Brinn is that man.

At  least, if he did it became so dark that we never saw him. Then we pulled  to where we thought the ship was, and, after rowing nearly all night,  caught sight of your lights; and here we are, dead tired, wet to the  skin, and minus about two miles of whale-line and three harpoons.\"        CHAPTER V.    _Miscellaneous reflections--The coast of Greenland--Upernavik--News of  the \"Pole Star\"--Midnight-day--Scientific facts and fairy-like  scenes--Tom Singleton's opinion of poor old women--In danger of a  squeeze--Escape._      In pursuance of his original intention, Captain Guy now proceeded  through Davis' Straits into Baffin's Bay, at the head of which he  intended to search for the vessel of his friend Captain Ellice, and  afterwards prosecute the whale-fishery. Off the coast of Greenland many  whalers were seen actively engaged in warfare with the giants of the  Polar Seas, and to several of these Captain Guy spoke, in the faint hope  of gleaning some information as to the fate of the _Pole Star_, but  without success. It was now apparent to the crew of the _Dolphin_ that  they were engaged as much on a searching as a whaling expedition; and  the fact that the commander of the lost vessel was the father of \"young  Mr. Fred,\" as they styled our hero, induced them to take a deep interest  in the success of their undertaking.    This interest was further increased by the graphic account that honest  John Buzzby gave of the death of poor Mrs. Ellice, and the enthusiastic  way in which he spoke of his old captain. Fred, too, had, by his frank,  affable manner and somewhat reckless disposition, rendered himself a  general favourite with the men, and had particularly recommended himself  to Mivins the steward (who was possessed of an intensely romantic  spirit), by stating once or twice very emphatically that he (Fred) meant  to land on the coast of Baffin's Bay, should the captain fail to find  his father, and continue the search on foot and alone. There was no  doubt whatever that poor Fred was in earnest, and had made up his mind  to die in the search rather than not find him. He little knew the  terrible nature of the country in which for a time his lot was to be  cast, and the hopelessness of such an undertaking as he meditated. With  boyish inconsiderateness he thought not of how his object was to be  accomplished; he cared not what impossibilities lay in the way; but,  with manly determination, he made up his mind to quit the ship and  search for his father through the length and breadth of the land. Let  not the reader smile at what he may perhaps style a childish piece of  enthusiasm. Many a youth at his age has dreamed of attempting as great  if not greater impossibilities. All honour, we say, to the boy who  _dreams_ impossibilities, and greater honour to him who, like Fred,  _resolves to attempt them!_ James Watt stared at an iron tea-kettle till  his eyes were dim, and meditated the monstrous impossibility of making  that kettle work like a horse; and men might (perhaps did) smile at  James Watt _then_, but do men smile at James Watt _now?_--now that  thousands of iron kettles are dashing like dreadful comets over the  length and breadth of the land, not to mention the sea, with long tails  of men and women and children behind them!    \"That's 'ow it is, sir,\" Mivins used to say, when spoken to by Fred on  the subject; \"I've never bin in cold countries myself, sir, but I've bin  in 'ot, and I knows that with a stout pair o' legs and a will to work, a  man can work 'is way hanywhere. Of course there's not much of a  pop'lation in them parts, I've heerd; but there's Heskimos, and where  one man can live so can another, and what one man can do so can  another--that's bin my hexperience, and I'm not ashamed to hown it, I'm  not, though I _do_ say it as shouldn't, and I honour you, sir, for your  filleral detarmination to find your father, sir, and--\"    \"Steward!\" shouted the captain down the cabin skylight.    \"Yes, sir!\"    \"Bring me the chart.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" and Mivins disappeared like a Jack-in-the-box from the cabin  just as Tom Singleton entered it.    \"Here we are, Fred,\" he said, seizing a telescope that hung over the  cabin door, \"within sight of the Danish settlement of Upernavik; come on  deck and see it.\"    Fred needed no second bidding. It was here that the captain had hinted  there would, probably, be some information obtained regarding the _Pole  Star_, and it was with feelings of no common interest that the two  friends examined the low-roofed houses of this out-of-the-way  settlement.    In an hour afterwards the captain and first mate with our young friends  landed amid the clamorous greetings of the entire population, and  proceeded to the residence of the governor, who received them with great  kindness and hospitality; but the only information they could obtain was  that, a year ago, Captain Ellice had been driven there in his brig by  stress of weather, and after refitting and taking in a supply of  provisions, had set sail for England.    Here the _Dolphin_ laid in a supply of dried fish, and procured several  dogs, besides an Esquimau interpreter and hunter, named Meetuck.    Leaving this little settlement, they stood out once more to sea, and  threaded their way among the ice, with which they were now well  acquainted in all its forms, from the mighty berg, or mountain of ice,  to the wide field. They passed in succession one or two Esquimau  settlements, the last of which, Yotlik, is the most northerly point of  colonization. Beyond this all was _terra incognita_. Here inquiry was  again made through the medium of the Esquimau interpreter who had been  taken on board at Upernavik, and they learned that the brig in question  had been last seen beset in the pack, and driving to the northward.  Whether or not she had ever returned they could not tell.    A consultation was now held, and it was resolved to proceed north, as  far as the ice would permit, towards Smith's Sound, and examine the  coast carefully in that direction.    For several weeks past there had been gradually coming over the aspect  of nature a change, to which we have not yet referred, and which filled  Fred Ellice and his friend, the young surgeon, with surprise and  admiration. This was the long-continued daylight, which now lasted the  whole night round, and increased in intensity every day as they advanced  north. They had, indeed, often heard and read of it before, but their  minds had utterly failed to form a correct conception of the exquisite  calmness and beauty of the _midnight-day_ of the north.    Every one knows that, in consequence of the axis of the earth not being  perpendicular to the plane of its orbit round the sun, the poles are  alternately directed more or less _towards_ that great luminary during  one part of the year, and _away_ from it during another part. So that  far north the days during the one season grow longer and longer until at  last there is _one long day_ of many weeks' duration, in which the sun  does not set at all; and during the other season there is _one long  night_, in which the sun is never seen. It was approaching the height of  the summer season when the _Dolphin_ entered the Arctic Regions, and,  although the sun descended below the horizon for a short time each  night, there was scarcely any diminution of the light at all, and, as  far as one's sensations were concerned, there was but one long  continuous day, which grew brighter and brighter at midnight as they  advanced.    \"How thoroughly splendid this is!\" remarked Tom Singleton to Fred one  night, as they sat in their favourite outlook, the main-top, gazing down  on the glassy sea, which was covered with snowy icebergs and floes, and  bathed in the rays of the sun; \"and how wonderful to think that the sun  will only set for an hour or so, and then get up as splendid as ever!\"    The evening was still as death. Not a sound broke upon the ear save the  gentle cries of a few sea-birds that dipped ever and anon into the sea,  as if to kiss it gently while asleep, and then circled slowly into the  bright sky again. The sails of the ship, too, flapped very gently, and a  spar creaked plaintively, as the vessel rose and fell on the gentle  undulations that seemed to be the breathing of the ocean. But such  sounds did not disturb the universal stillness of the hour; neither did  the gambols of yonder group of seals and walruses that were at play  round some fantastic blocks of ice; nor did the soft murmur of the swell  that broke in surf at the foot of yonder iceberg, whose blue sides were  seamed with a thousand watercourses, and whose jagged pinnacles rose up  like needles of steel into the clear atmosphere.    There were many bergs in sight, of various shapes and sizes, at some  distance from the ship, which caused much anxiety to the captain,  although they were only a source of admiration to our young friends in  the main-top.    \"Tom,\" said Fred, breaking a long silence, \"it may seem a strange idea  to you, but, do you know, I cannot help fancying that heaven must be  something like this.\"    \"I'm not sure that that's such a strange idea, Fred, for it has two of  the characteristics of heaven in it--peace and rest.\"    \"True; that didn't strike me. Do you know, I wish that it were always  calm like this, and that we had no wind at all.\"    Tom smiled. \"Your voyage would be a long one if that were to happen. I  daresay the Esquimaux would join with you in the wish, however, for  their kayaks and oomiaks are better adapted for a calm than a stormy  sea.\"    \"Tom,\" said Fred, breaking another long silence, \"you're very tiresome  and stupid to-night, why don't you talk to me?\"    \"Because this delightful dreamy evening inclines me to think and be  silent.\"    \"Ah, Tom! that's your chief fault. You are always inclined"]]]
