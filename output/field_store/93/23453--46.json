On the journey out from France it is  said that Roberval took with him his niece Marguerite, a high-born  lady, who was accompanied by an old companion or nurse. Marguerite was  travelling with her uncle because, unknown to him, she had a lover who  had sailed with him on this expedition and whom she hoped to marry. As  they crossed the Atlantic these facts leaked out, and Roberval  resolved to bide his time and punish his niece for her deception. As  they passed the coast of Southern Labrador Marguerite and her old  nurse were seized and put into a boat, Roberval ordering his sailors  to row them ashore to an island, and leave them to their fate. They  were given four guns with ammunition and a small supply of provisions.  But, as the boat was leaving the ship, Marguerite's lover threw  himself into the sea and swam to the island. Here, according to the  story which Marguerite is supposed to have told afterwards, they  endeavoured to live by killing the wild animals and eating their  flesh; but her lover-husband died, so also did her child soon after it  was born, and then the old nurse, and the unhappy Marguerite was left  alone with the wild beasts, especially the white Polar bears, who  thronged round her hut. Nevertheless she kept them at bay with her  arquebus, and managed somehow to support an existence, until after  nineteen months' isolation the ascending smoke of her fire was seen by  people on one of the many fishing vessels which, by this time,  frequented the coasts of Newfoundland. She was taken off the island  and restored to her home in France. The island to which this tradition  more especially relates is now called Grand Meccatina.]    However, when the weather was warm again, in June, 1543, Roberval  started up the St. Lawrence River in boats to reach the wonderful  country of Saguenay. Apparently he met with little success, and, being  relieved by French ships in the late summer of 1543, he returned to  France.    Thus the splendid work achieved by Cartier seemed to have come to  nothing, for neither he nor Roberval revisited America. The French  settlement near Quebec was abandoned, so far as the officers of the  French king were concerned, and between 1545 and about 1583, if any  other Frenchman or European visited Canada it was some private  adventurer who traded with the natives in furs, or Basques from France  and Spain who frequented the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence on  account of the abundance of whales, walruses, and seals. In fact, at  the close of the sixteenth century, the Spanish Basques had  established themselves on shore at Tadoussac and other places, and  seemed likely to colonize the country.          CHAPTER III    Elizabethan Pioneers in North America      Except that the ships of Bristol still no doubt continued to resort to  the banks of Newfoundland for fishing, and that even the captains of  these ships were occasionally elected admirals of the French, Basque,  Portuguese, and English fishing fleets during the summer, the English,  as a nation, took no part in claiming political dominion over North  America after the voyage of Captain John Rut in 1527. This was the  fault of Sebastian Cabot, the son of the man who founded British  America, and who had returned to England long afterwards as the Grand  Pilot appointed by Edward VI to further the discovery of a northern  sea passage to China. Through him the attention of adventurers for a  time was diverted from America to the \"discovery\" of Russia (as it has  been called). The efforts of Sebastion Cabot were directed towards the  revelation of a north-east passage by way of Arctic Russia to the  Pacific, rather than past Newfoundland and Labrador and across Arctic  America.    But as soon as Elizabeth came to the throne the sea adventurers of  Britain, freed from any subservience to Spanish wishes, developed  maritime intercourse between England, Morocco, and West Africa on the  one hand, and Tropical and North America on the other. Once more the  discovery of the North-west Passage across America to China came into  favour. MARTIN FROBISHER[1] offered himself as a discoverer, and the  Earl of Warwick found the means which provided him with two small  sailing vessels of 25 and 20 tons each, besides a pinnace of 10  tons.[2] Queen Elizabeth confined herself, in the way of  encouragement, to waving her lily hand from her palace of Greenwich as  these three little boats dropped down the Thames on the 8th of June,  1576. She also sent them \"an honourable message\", which no doubt  reached them at Tilbury.    [Footnote 1: The name was also spelt Furbusher, and in other ways. He  became Sir Martin Frobisher over the wars of the Armada, and died Lord  High Admiral of England in 1592.]    [Footnote 2: It may be of interest to set forth the kind of rations  shipped in those Elizabethan times for the food of the sailors.  According to Frobisher's accounts these consisted of salted beef, salt  pork, salt fish, biscuit, meal for making bread, dried peas, oatmeal,  rice, cheese, butter, beer, and wine, with brandy for emergencies. As  regards beer, the men were to have a ration of 1 gallon a day each.  Altogether it may be said that these rations were superior in  variety--and no doubt in quality--to the food given to seamen in the  British merchant marine in the nineteenth century.]    But the pinnace was soon swallowed up in the high seas; the seamen in  the vessel of 20 tons lost heart and turned their ship homewards.  Frobisher alone, in his 25-ton bark, sailed on and on across the  stormy Atlantic, past the south end of Greenland, and over the great  gulf that separates Greenland from Labrador. He missed the entrance to  Hudson's Bay, but reached a great \"island\" which he named Meta  Incognita[3]. Here he gathered up stones and, as he believed,  minerals, besides capturing at least one Eskimo, and then returned.    [Footnote 3: We now know Meta Incognita to be the southernmost  peninsula of the vast Baffin Island.]    One of his stones was declared by the refiners of London to contain  gold. There was at once--as we should say in modern slang--a boom for  these Arctic regions. Queen Elizabeth took part in it, and on the 27th  of May, 1577, a considerable fleet, under the command of Frobisher,  sailed past the Orkneys for the south end of Greenland. It did not  reach as far as Meta Incognita, but it brought back large heaps of  earth and pieces of rock, probably from northern Labrador, which  almost certainly contained mica schist, and were therefore believed  to be full of gold. The following year 1578, Frobisher started on his  third American voyage with a fleet of fifteen vessels, mainly financed  by Queen Elizabeth, and manned to a great extent by the sons of the  aristocracy, besides a hundred persons who were going out as  colonists. For this region of ice and snow which was believed to be a  mass of gold-bearing rocks! But the result was one of bitter  disappointment. The captains were bewildered by the immense icebergs,  \"so vast that, as they melted, torrents poured from them in sparkling  waterfalls\". One iceberg toppled over on to a ship and crushed it,  though most of the sailors were picked up in the sea and saved. In the  thick mists the greater part of the fleet blundered into Hudson's  Straits, yet did not realize that they had found a passage into the  heart of Canada. At last, disgusted with this land of bare rocks, ice,  and snow, they filled up the ships with cargoes of stones supposed to  contain gold, and straggled back to England. No gold was extracted,  however, from these cargoes, and much discouragement ensued.    SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT, one of the brilliant figures of Elizabeth's  reign--scholar, poet, courageous adventurer, and man of  chivalry--stimulated by the discoveries of Frobisher, obtained a  patent or charter in 1578, and, after several unsuccessful attempts,  led an expedition of small sailing ships to Newfoundland, where he  entered St. John's Bay, and in the presence of the Basque, Portuguese,  and Breton fishermen took formal possession of the country for Queen  Elizabeth, raising a pillar on which the arms of England were engraved  as a token. He then proceeded to grant lands to the fishermen to  reassure them, and loaded his ships with rocks brought from the  interior mountains and supposed to contain minerals. But in his  further explorations of the southern coast of Newfoundland one of the  ships was lost and nearly a hundred men intended as colonists were  drowned.    Gilbert then determined to return to England in his small frigate of  10 tons named the _Squirrel_. He was accompanied by a larger vessel,  the _Golden Hinde_, but refused to leave the men on the _Squirrel_ to  their fate. Consequently, between the Azores and the north coast of  Spain, when the _Squirrel_ was overwhelmed by the heavy seas, Sir  Humphrey Gilbert perished together with all on board.    In spite, however, of the disappointing results of Gilbert's attempt  to found a colony in Newfoundland, the importance of the cod fishery  and the ivory tusks and oil of the walruses drew ever more and more  ships from Bristol and Devonshire to the coasts of that great island  and to the Gulf of St. Lawrence beyond. In 1592 the English  adventurers got as far west as Anticosti Island (in a ship from  Bristol), and in 1597 there is the first record of English ships (from  London--the _Hopewell_ and the _Chancewell_) sailing up the St.  Lawrence River, perhaps as far west as Quebec.    In 1602, stimulated by Sir Walter Raleigh,[4] Bartholomew Gosnold  sailed direct to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13007"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"derstood.      _Loki_. (Page 26.)    It is hardly necessary to point out the parallel between Loki and  Prometheus, also both helper and enemy of the Gods, and agent in their  threatened fall, though in the meantime a prisoner. In character  Loki has more in common with the mischievous spirit described by  Hesiod, than with the heroic figure of Aeschylus. The struggles of  Loki (p. 28) find a parallel in those of the fire-serpent Typhon,  to which the Greeks attributed earthquakes.      _Eclipse Ritual_. (Page 35.)    Mr. Lang, in _Myth, Ritual, and Religion_, (London, 1887)  gives  examples of eclipse ritual.
