Under their instruction he proved as  ready a scholar, as he had been indocile and restive to the pedant who  held the office of his tutor. It was now evident that his small  proficiency in literature was by no means to be ascribed to want of  capacity. He discovered no contemptible sagacity and quick-wittedness in  the science of horse-flesh, and was eminently expert in the arts of  shooting, fishing, and hunting. Nor did he confine himself to these, but  added the theory and practice of boxing, cudgel play, and quarter-staff.  These exercises added ten-fold robustness and vigour to his former  qualifications.    His stature, when grown, was somewhat more than five feet ten inches in  height, and his form might have been selected by a painter as a model  for that hero of antiquity, whose prowess consisted in felling an ox  with his fist, and devouring him at a meal. Conscious of his advantage  in this respect, he was insupportably arrogant, tyrannical to his  inferiors, and insolent to his equals. The activity of his mind being  diverted from the genuine field of utility and distinction, showed  itself in the rude tricks of an overgrown lubber. Here, as in all his  other qualifications, he rose above his competitors; and if it had been  possible to overlook the callous and unrelenting disposition which they  manifested, one could scarcely have denied his applause to the invention  these freaks displayed, and the rough, sarcastic wit with which they  were accompanied.    Mr. Tyrrel was by no means inclined to permit these extraordinary merits  to rust in oblivion. There was a weekly assembly at the nearest  market-town, the resort of all the rural gentry. Here he had hitherto  figured to the greatest advantage as grand master of the _coterie_, no  one having an equal share of opulence, and the majority, though still  pretending to the rank of gentry, greatly his inferior in this essential  article. The young men in this circle looked up to this insolent bashaw  with timid respect, conscious of the comparative eminence that  unquestionably belonged to the powers of his mind; and he well knew how  to maintain his rank with an inflexible hand. Frequently indeed he  relaxed his features, and assumed a temporary appearance of affableness  and familiarity; but they found by experience, that if any one,  encouraged by his condescension, forgot the deference which Mr. Tyrrel  considered as his due, he was soon taught to repent his presumption. It  was a tiger that thought proper to toy with a mouse, the little animal  every moment in danger of being crushed by the fangs of his ferocious  associate. As Mr. Tyrrel had considerable copiousness of speech, and a  rich, but undisciplined imagination, he was always sure of an audience.  His neighbours crowded round, and joined in the ready laugh, partly from  obsequiousness, and partly from unfeigned admiration. It frequently  happened, however; that, in the midst of his good humour, a  characteristic refinement of tyranny would suggest itself to his mind.  When his subjects, encouraged by his familiarity, had discarded their  precaution, the wayward fit would seize him, a sudden cloud overspread  his brow, his voice transform from the pleasant to the terrible, and a  quarrel of a straw immediately ensue with the first man whose face he  did not like. The pleasure that resulted to others from the exuberant  sallies of his imagination was, therefore, not unalloyed with sudden  qualms of apprehension and terror. It may be believed that this  despotism did not gain its final ascendancy without being contested in  the outset. But all opposition was quelled with a high hand by this  rural Antaeus. By the ascendancy of his fortune, and his character among  his neighbours, he always reduced his adversary to the necessity of  encountering him at his own weapons, and did not dismiss him without  making him feel his presumption through every joint in his frame. The  tyranny of Mr. Tyrrel would not have been so patiently endured, had not  his colloquial accomplishments perpetually come in aid of that authority  which his rank and prowess originally obtained.    The situation of our squire with the fair was still more enviable than  that which he maintained among persons of his own sex. Every mother  taught her daughter to consider the hand of Mr. Tyrrel as the highest  object of her ambition. Every daughter regarded his athletic form and  his acknowledged prowess with a favourable eye. A form eminently  athletic is, perhaps, always well proportioned; and one of the  qualifications that women are early taught to look for in the male sex,  is that of a protector. As no man was adventurous enough to contest his  superiority, so scarcely any woman in this provincial circle would have  scrupled to prefer his addresses to those of any other admirer. His  boisterous wit had peculiar charms for them; and there was no spectacle  more flattering to their vanity, than seeing this Hercules exchange his  club for a distaff. It was pleasing to them to consider, that the fangs  of this wild beast, the very idea of which inspired trepidation into the  boldest hearts, might be played with by them with the utmost security.    Such was the rival that Fortune, in her caprice, had reserved for the  accomplished Falkland. This untamed, though not undiscerning brute, was  found capable of destroying the prospects of a man the most eminently  qualified to enjoy and to communicate happiness. The feud that sprung up  between them was nourished by concurring circumstances, till it attained  a magnitude difficult to be paralleled; and, because they regarded each  other with a deadly hatred, I have become an object of misery and  abhorrence.    The arrival of Mr. Falkland gave an alarming shock to the authority of  Mr. Tyrrel in the village assembly and in all scenes of indiscriminate  resort. His disposition by no means inclined him to withhold himself  from scenes of fashionable amusement; and he and his competitor were  like two stars fated never to appear at once above the horizon. The  advantages Mr. Falkland possessed in the comparison are palpable; and  had it been otherwise, the subjects of his rural neighbour were  sufficiently disposed to revolt against his merciless dominion. They had  hitherto submitted from fear, and not from love; and, if they had not  rebelled, it was only for want of a leader. Even the ladies regarded Mr.  Falkland with particular complacence. His polished manners were  peculiarly in harmony with feminine delicacy. The sallies of his wit  were far beyond those of Mr. Tyrrel in variety and vigour; in addition  to which they had the advantage of having their spontaneous exuberance  guided and restrained by the sagacity of a cultivated mind. The graces  of his person were enhanced by the elegance of his deportment; and the  benevolence and liberality of his temper were upon all occasions  conspicuous. It was common indeed to Mr. Tyrrel, together with Mr.  Falkland, to be little accessible to sentiments of awkwardness and  confusion. But for this Mr. Tyrrel was indebted to a self-satisfied  effrontery, and a boisterous and over-bearing elocution, by which he was  accustomed to discomfit his assailants; while Mr. Falkland, with great  ingenuity and candour of mind, was enabled by his extensive knowledge of  the world, and acquaintance with his own resources, to perceive almost  instantaneously the proceeding it most became him to adopt.    Mr. Tyrrel contemplated the progress of his rival with uneasiness and  aversion. He often commented upon it to his particular confidents as a  thing altogether inconceivable. Mr. Falkland he described as an animal  that was beneath contempt. Diminutive and dwarfish in his form, he  wanted to set up a new standard of human nature, adapted to his  miserable condition. He wished to persuade people that the human species  were made to be nailed to a chair, and to pore over books. He would have  them exchange those robust exercises which make us joyous in the  performance, and vigorous in the consequences, for the wise labour of  scratching our heads for a rhyme and counting our fingers for a verse.  Monkeys were as good men as these. A nation of such animals would have  no chance with a single regiment of the old English votaries of beef and  pudding. He never saw any thing come of learning but to make people  foppish and impertinent; and a sensible man would not wish a worse  calamity to the enemies of his nation, than to see them run mad after  such pernicious absurdities. It was impossible that people could  seriously feel any liking for such a ridiculous piece of goods as this  outlandish foreign-made Englishman. But he knew very well how it was: it  was a miserable piece of mummery that was played only in spite of him.  But God for ever blast his soul, if he were not bitterly revenged upon  them all!    If such were the sentiments of Mr. Tyrrel, his patience found ample  exercise in the language which was held by the rest of his neighbours on  the same subject. While he saw nothing in Mr. Falkland but matter of  contempt, they appeared to be never weary of recounting his praises.  Such dignity, such affability, so perpetual an attention to the  happiness of others, such delicacy of sentiment and expression! Learned  without ostentation, refined without foppery, elegant without  effeminacy! Perpetually anxious to prevent his superiority from being  painfully felt, it was so much the more certainly felt to be real, and  excited congratulation instead of envy in the spectator. It is scarcely  necessary to remark, that the revolution of sentiment in this rural  vicinity belongs to one of the most obvious features of the human mind.  The rudest exhibition of art is at first admired, till a nobler is  presented, and we are taught to wonder at the facility "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11330"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

When I was speaking of the cure of the digestive organs, I spoke of  stomachic irritation, and said it was occasioned by some morbid  peculiarity. It is difficult to find out the exigents; it must be done by  experiment. We give a medicine, it answers. The digestive organs have such  a sympathy with contiguous organs, that no wonder if such contiguous organs  are affected. The liver, for instance, cannot perform its office aright if  the bowels are uncomfortable. Violent drastics are wrong, they do not do  good; you cannot go on giving physic every day, this will teaze the bowels  and not tranquilize them, The cure is to repeat the excitement of  progressive action. People in general will not find out that what may be an  adequate excitement one day, may not be an adequate excitement on another  day. As to these things, they are easily managed, and you should attend to  them. Every person advanced in life knows this, and attends to it. Doctor  Curry, whom I used to call the poetical doctor, says, very justly, \"It is  in medicine as it is in morals, you must break bad habits, and establish  good ones.\"    Where the liver is primarily affected, small doses of quicksilver act in a  wonderful and a prodigious manner. How the stomach, when wrong, disturbs  the head, is apparent to every one. How a faulty action of the liver  disturbs the head is also well known; but the liver, in an especial manner,  disturbs the head.    A Yorkshireman came three hundred miles, as he told me, on purpose to see  me, and he said he was going back again by the mail the same night. I asked  him what could induce him to come so far. His reply was, \"Why you once set  up a friend of mine, and I thought you could set me up too.\"    I would have you keep your eyes open to this, that we are perpetually  putting wrong our digestive organs by our absurdities in diet. These  organs, if long wrong, will affect the spinal chord, producing lumbar  numbness. Now, then, I have surveyed the influence of local maladies in  disturbing the nervous energies, and now I say there is a reflected action  in them, and they become a fruitful source of a numerous and dissimilar  progeny of local diseases.    People are disposed to say I am apt to exaggerate too much; but I merely  relate what I have seen in my time, and you will all have numerous  instances by and by of making the same observations, and I think at last  you will come to the same conclusions.    I now speak of local diseases; and, first, of phlegmonous inflammation. I  do not much like the term phlegmonous inflammation, because phlegmon alone  is inflammation. That the vessels, particularly the arteries, of inflamed  parts are disposed to receive more blood, is manifest. Mr. Hunter froze the  ears of rabbits, and the arteries inflamed and were filled with blood,  throbbing, and pain. When there is great disturbance of the arterious  system, with throbbing, there is always acute pain. In common whitlow of  the finger, how the arteries of the arm, the brachial in particular, throb,  is well known. In proportion as arteries are excited to vehement action,  some difficulty occurs to the transmission of the blood into the veins. Dr.  Phillips found that inflamed blood is slower in cooling than common blood.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.        \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other men's      stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *    Sir Boyle Roche, was arguing for the Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill, in  Ireland:--\"It would surely be better, Mr. Speaker,\" said he, \"to give up  not only a _part_, but, if necessary, even the _whole_, of our  constitution, to preserve _the remainder!_\"    _Barrington's Sketches_.           *       *       *       *       *      A short time since the manager of Sadler's Wells, wishing to make an  alteration in his bills, sent an old one with the corrections made in the  margin, to the printer.
