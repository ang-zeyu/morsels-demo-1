[Illustration: Medlers]      _To make a Tart of Medlers._    Take _Medlers_ that be rotten, and stamp them, and set them upon  a chafin dish with coales, and beat in two yolks of Eggs, boyling  till it be somewhat thick, then season it with _Sugar, Cinamon_,  and _Ginger_, and lay it in paste.           *     *     *     *     *          _Of Cucumbers._      _How to keep Cucumbers._    Take a kettle big enough for your use, halfe full of water, make  it brackish with salt, boyle therein ten or twenty _Cucumbers_, cut  in halves, then take the raw _Cucumbers_, being somewhat little,  and put them into the vessell wherein you will keep them, and  when your liquor is cold straine so much of it into them, as may  keep the _Cucumbers_ alwayes covered.      _To keep boyled Cucumbers._    Take a kettle of water, put salt to it, boyle it well, then take  your raw _Cucumbers_, put them into it, and keep them with turning  up and downe very softly, till they be as it were per-boyled,  then take them out, and lay them aside till they be cold, then put  them up in the vessel you will keep them in, and when the liquor  is cold, straine it into them, till they be all covered.      _To Pickle Cucumbers to keep all the yeare._    Pare a good quantity of the rindes of _Cucumbers_, and boyle  them in a quart of running water, and a pint of wine _Vineger_,  with a handfull of _salt_, till they be soft, then letting them stand  till the liquor be quite cold, pour out the liquor from the rinds,  into some little barrel, earthen pot, or other vessel, that may be  close stopped, and put as many of the youngest _Cucumbers_ you can  gather, therein, as the liquor will cover, and so keep them close  covered, that no winde come to them, to use all the year till they  have new; if your _Cucumbers_ be great, 'tis best to boyle them in  the liquor till they be soft.           *       *       *       *       *          *OF COOKERY.*      _To make Snow._    Take a quart of thick _Creame_, and five or six whites of _Eggs_,  a sauser full of _sugar_ finely beaten, and as much _Rose water_, beat  them all together, and always as it riseth take it out with a spoon,  then take a loaf of _Bread_, cut away the crust, set it in a platter,  and a great _Rosemary_ bush in the middest of it, then lay your  Snow with a Spoon upon the _Rosemary_, and so serve it.      _To make Spiced Bread._    Take two pound of Manchet paste, sweet _Butter_ halfe a pound,  _Currants_ halfe a pound, _sugar_ a quarter, and a little _Mace_, if you  will put in any, and make it in a loafe, and bake it in an Oven,  no hotter then for Manchet.      _To make Craknels._    Take five or six pints of the finest _Wheat_ flower you can get, to  which you must put in a spoonfull (and not above) of good _Yest_,  then mingle it well with _Butter, cream, Rose-water_, and _sugar_, finely  beaten, and working it well into paste, make it after what forme  you will, and bake it.      _To make Veale-tooh's, or Olives._    Take the _Kidney_ of a line of _Veale_ roasted, with a good deale of  the fat, and a little of the flesh, mingle it very small, and put to it  two _Eggs_, one _Nutmeg_ finely grated, a good quantity of _sugar_,  a few _Currants_, a little _salt_, stir them well together, and make them  into the form of little _Pasties_, and fry them in a pan with sweet  _Butter_.      _To make a Barley Creame to procure sleepe, or Almond  Milke._    Take a good handfull of French _Barley_, wash it cleane in warme  water, and boyle it in a quart of fayre water to the halfe, then put  out the water from the _Barley_, and put the _Barley_ into a pottell of  new clean water, with a _Parsley_, and a _Fennell_ root, clean washed,  and picked with _Bourage, Buglos, Violet_ leaves, and _Lettice_, of each  one handfull, boyle them with the _Barley_, till more then halfe be  consumed; then strayne out the liquor, and take of blanched  _Almonds_ a handfull, of the seeds of _Melons, Cucumbers, Citralls_, and  _Gourds_, husked, of each halfe a quarter of an ounce, beat these  seeds, and the _Almonds_ together, in a stone morter, with so much  _Sugar_, and _Rose-water_ as is fit, and strayne them through a cleane  cloath into the liquor, and drink thereof at night going to bed,  and in the night, if this doth not sufficiently provoke sleep, then  make some more of the same liquor,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#8)"],[1," imperial feet, but a servant should attend when he can  perform a service, and therefore I am come--        'When Kings' ears itch, they use a straw to scratch 'em;      When Kings' foes plot, they get wise men to match 'em.'    'H'm!' growled the Lion.    'Your Majesty suspects my intellect, I fear,' continued the  Jackal,'after so long an absence from your Majesty's feet; but, if I may  say so, it is still sound.'    'H'm!' growled the Lion again.    'A king, may it please your Majesty, should know how to estimate his  servants, whatever their position--        'Pearls are dull in leaden settings, but the setter is to blame;      Glass will glitter like the ruby, dulled with dust--are they the same?        'And a fool may tread on jewels, setting in his crown mere glass;      Yet, at selling, gems are gems, and fardels but for fardels pass.'

'Accept then, Sire, from the humblest of your slaves his very humble  counsel--for        'Wisdom from the mouth of children be it overpast of none;      What man scorns to walk by lamplight in the absence of the sun?'    'Good Damanaka,' said King Tawny-hide, somewhat appeased, 'how is it  that thou, so wise a son of our first minister, hast been absent all  this while from our Court? But now speak thy mind fearlessly: what  wouldst thou?'    'Will your Majesty deign to answer one question?' said Damanaka.  'Wherefore came He back from the river without drinking?'    'Hush!' whispered the King, 'thou hast hit right upon my trouble. I knew  no one unto whom I might confide it; but thou seemest a faithful fellow,  and I will tell thee. Listen, then,' continued his Majesty in an  agitated whisper, 'there is some awful beast that was never seen before  in this wood here; and we shall have to leave it, look you. Did you hear  by chance the inconceivable great roar he gave? What a strong beast it  must be to have such a voice!'    'May it please your Majesty, I did hear the noise,' said the Jackal,  'and there is doubtless cause for terrible apprehension therein; but  take comfort, my Liege, he is no minister who bids thee prepare for  either war or resignation. All will go well, and your Majesty will learn  by this difficulty which be your best servants,'    'Good Jackal,' said Tawny-hide, 'I am horribly frightened about it.'    'I can see that,' thought Damanaka; but he only said, 'Fear nothing, my  liege, while thy servant survives,'    'What shall I do?' asked the King.    'It is well to encourage those who can avert disaster. If your Majesty  condescended now to bestow some favor on Karataka and the other----'    'It shall be done,' said the Rajah; and, summoning the other Jackals, he  gave them and Damanaka a magnificent gift of flesh, and they left the  presence, undertaking to meet the threatened danger.    'But, brother,' began Karataka,'haven't we eaten the King's dinner  without knowing what the danger is which we are to meet, and whether we  can obviate it?'    'Hold thy peace,' said Damanaka, laughing; 'I know very well what the  danger is! It was a bull, aha! that bellowed--a bull, my brother--whose  beef you and I could pick, much more the King our master.'    'And why not tell him so?' asked Karataka.    'What! and quiet his Majesty's fears! And where would our splendid  dinner have been then? No, no, my friend--        'Set not your lord at ease; for, doing that,      Might starve you as it starved \"Curd-ear\" the Cat.'    'Who was Curd-ear, the Cat?' inquired Karataka. Damanaka related:--      THE STORY OF THE CAT WHO SERVED THE LION    \"Far away in the North, on a mountain named 'Thousand-Crags,' there  lived a lion called 'Mighty-heart'; and he was much annoyed by a certain  mouse, who made a custom of nibbling his mane while he lay asleep in his  den. The Lion would wake in a great rage at finding the ends of his  magnificent mane made ragged, but the little mouse ran into his hole,  and he could never catch it. After much consideration he went down to a  village, and got a Cat named Curd-ear to come to his cave with much  persuasion. He kept the Cat royally on all kinds of dainties, and slept  comfortably without having his mane nibbled, as the mouse would now  never venture out. Whenever the Lion heard the mouse scratching about,  that was always a signal for regaling the Cat in a most distinguished  style. But one day, the wretched mouse being nearly starved, he took  courage to creep timidly from his hole, and was directly pounced upon by  Curd-ear and killed. After that the Lion heard no more of the mouse, and  quite left off his regular entertainments of the Cat. No!\" concluded  Damanaka, \"we will keep our mouse alive for his Majesty.\"    So conversing, the Jackals went away to find Lusty-life the Bull, and  upon discovering him, Karataka squatted down with great dignity at the  foot of a tree, while Damanaka approached to accost him.    'Bull,' said Damanaka, 'I am the warder of this forest under the King  Tawny-hide, and Karataka the Jackal there is his General. The General  bids thee come before him, or else instantly depart from the wood. It  were better for thee to obey, for his anger is terrible,'    'Thereupon Lusty-life, knowing nothing of the country customs, advanced  at once to Karataka, made the respectful prostration of the eight  members, and said timidly, 'My Lord General! what dost thou bid me do?--        'Strength serves Reason. Saith the Mahout, when he beats the brazen              drum,      \"Ho! ye elephants, to this work must your mightinesses come.\"'    'Bull,' answered Karataka, 'thou canst remain in the wood no longer  unless thou goest directly to lay thyself at our Royal master's imperial  feet.'    'My Lord,' replied the Bull, 'give me a guarantee of safety, and I will  go.'    'Bull,' said Karataka, 'thou art foolish; fear nothing--        \"When the King of Chedi cursed him,        Krishna scorned to make reply;      Lions roar the thunder quiet,        Jackals'-yells they let go by.\"    Our Lord the King will not vouchsafe his anger to thee; knowest thou  not--        'Mighty natures war with mighty: when the raging tempests blow,      O'er the green rice harmless pass they, but they lay the palm-trees              low,'    'So the Jackals, keeping Lusty-life in the rear, went towards the palace  of King Tawny-hide; where the Rajah received them with much  graciousness, and bade them sit down.    'Have you seen him?' asked the King.    'We have seen him, your Majesty,' answered Damanaka; 'it is quite as  your Majesty expected--the creature has enormous strength, and wishes  to see your Majesty. Will you be seated, Sire, and prepare yourself--it  will never do to appear alarmed at a noise.'    'Oh, if it was only a noise,' began the Rajah.    'Ah, but the cause, Sire! that was what had to be found out; like the  secret of Swing-ear the Spirit.'    'And who might Swing-ear be?' asked the King.      THE STORY OF THE TERRIBLE BELL    \"A goblin, your Majesty,\" responded Damanaka, \"it seemed so, at least,  to the good people of Brahmapoora. A thief had stolen a bell from the  city, and was making off with that plunder, and more, into the  Sri-parvata hills, when he was killed by a tiger. The bell lay in the  jungle till some monkeys picked it up, and amused themselves by  constantly ringing it. The townspeople found the bones of the man, and  heard the noise of the bell all about the hills; so they gave out that  there was a terrible devil there, whose ears rang like bells as he swung  them about, and whose delight was to devour men. Every one, accordingly,  was leaving the town, when a peasant woman named Karala, who liked  belief the better for a little proof, came to the Rajah.    'Highness!' she observed, 'for a consideration I could settle this  Swing-ear.'    'You could!' exclaimed the Rajah.    'I think so!' repeated the woman.    'Give her a consideration forthwith,' said the Rajah.    \"Karala, who had her own ideas upon the matter, took the present and set  out. Being come to the hills, she made a circle, and did homage to  Gunputtee,[13] without whom nothing prospers. Then, taking some fruit  she had brought, such as monkeys love extremely, she scattered it up and  down in the wood, and withdrew to watch. Very soon the monkeys finding  the fruit, put down the bell, to do justice to it, and the woman picking  it up, bore it back to the town, where she became an object of uncommon  veneration. We, indeed,\" concluded Damanaka, \"bring you a Bull instead  of a bell--your Majesty shall now see him!\"    \"Thereupon Lusty-life was introduced, and, the interview passing off  well, he remained many days in the forest on excellent terms with the  Lion.    'One day another Lion, named 'Stiff-ears,' the brother of King  Tawny-hide, came to visit him. The King received him with all imaginable  respect, bade him be seated, and rose from his throne to go and kill  some beasts for his refreshment.    'May it please your Majesty,' interposed the Bull, 'a deer was slain  to-day--where is its flesh?'    'Damanaka and his brother know best,' said the King.    'Let us ascertain if there be any,' suggested the Bull.    'It is useless,' said the King, laughing--'they leave none,'    'What!' exclaimed the Bull, 'have those Jackals eaten a whole deer?'    'Eaten it, spoiled it, and given it away,' answered Tawny-hide; 'they  always do so,'    'And this without your Majesty's sanction?' asked the Bull.    'Oh! certainly not with my sanction,' said the King.    'Then,' exclaimed"]]]
