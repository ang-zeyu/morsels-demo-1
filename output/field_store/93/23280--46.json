Thus the soul is filled with thought images that assume the form  of vicious animals, homely visaged fowls, rabid and snarling  cats and dogs, leprous and virile serpents, cankerous lizards,  slimy intestine worms, hairy and malicious insects.  They are generated by greed, envy, jealousy, covetousness, backbiting,  amorous longings and other impure thoughts.  With the soul filled  with this conglomeration of virus and filth, why doubt a hell and its  counterpart condition, or expect the day or night to bring happiness?  If evil thoughts will infest the soul with ravenous microbes,  good thoughts and deeds will starve and suppress their activity,  and create a heaven to supplant them.  With this grand and eternal  truth in view, man should ever think kindly of those about him,  control his temper in word and action, seek his own, think the best  of thoughts, study to relieve the worthy poor, seek solace in the depth  of being, and let gentleness and meekness characterize his life.  Then will he sow the seeds of a present and future heaven.  His day thoughts and his night thoughts in harmony will point  with unerring forecast to a peaceful end.  Spiritual and helpful  warnings will fall upon the dream mind, as gently as dew upon  the flowers and as softly as a mother's kiss upon the lips of love.  When our external lives are guided by the forces within,  sweet are the words and messages from our own spirit;  for those who are truly blessed are those who seek divine love  through the channels of their inner world of consciousness.        {illust. caption = A DIAGRAM GIVING THE THEORY OF THIS BOOK,  AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MICROCOSM AND THE MACROCOSM.    FRAGMENTARY THOUGHTS FROM DREAM REALMS:}      Man is a little circle or world composed of the infinitesimal atoms thrown  off from the great circle or parent world, and fitting into his place  in the zone of life.  If in the revolutions of the great circle he catches  more material he increases his circle to objective or subjective growth:  if he absorbs spiritual or mind atoms as they fall from the great body  of creative source, he enlarges or contracts his own circle according  to the assimilation of the food he receives from the parent.    It is optional with man to obtain spiritual or material manna  as it is disseminated throughout existence.  To feed on material  diet alone, contracts and distorts the circle of the man;  but a full comprehension of the needs of the circle, a proper  denial of supply to some of the compounds, together with a tender  care of other parts, will round out the whole into a perfect  physical and mental circle of life.    Dissentious and conflicting results should be avoided in computing  the length and breadth of the compounded circle of man's individual world.  Objective life is one of the smallest compounds in real life.    Dream life is fuller of meaning and teaching of the inner, or God life,  than is the exterior life of man.  The mind receives education  from communing with the dream composition in the great circle.  Consult with your whole nature or circle before beginning a serious work;  partial consultations, or material advice only, often brings defeat  of objects sought, when a true home counsel would have brought success  and consequent happiness.    Man should live in his subjective realms and study more his  relation to other compositions or circles; thus fructifying  and making beautiful his own world through intercourse with  others who have worked in the great storehouse of subjectivity,  and who have climbed already from the basement into the light  of spiritual sunshine.    * * * *    A FEW QUESTIONS AND SUBJECTIVE ANSWERS REGARDING DREAMS.      QUESTION.--What is a dream?    ANSWER--A dream is an event transpiring in that world belonging to the mind  when the objective senses have withdrawn into rest or oblivion.    Then the spiritual man is living alone in the future or ahead  of objective life and consequently lives man's future first,  developing conditions in a way that enables waking man to shape  his actions by warnings, so as to make life a perfect existence.    Q.--What relationship is sustained between the average man and his dreams?    A.--A dream to the average or sensual person, bears the same relation to his  objective life that it maintained in the case of the ideal dreamer, but it  means pleasures, sufferings and advancements on a lower or material plane.    Q.--Then why is man not always able to correctly interpret his dreams?    A.--Just as words fail sometimes to express ideas, so dreams fail  sometimes in their mind pictures to portray coming events.    Q.--If they relate to the future, why is it we so often dream  of the past?    A.--When a person dreams of past events, those events are warnings of evil  or good; sometimes they are stamped so indelibly upon the subjective mind  that the least tendency of the waking mind to the past throws these pictures  in relief on the dream consciousness.    Q.--Why is it that present environments often influence our dreams?    A.--Because the future of man is usually affected by the present,  so if he mars the present by wilful wrongs, or makes it bright  by right living it will necessarily have influence on his dreams,  as they are forecastings of the future.    Q.--What is an apparition?    A.--It is the subjective mind stored with the wisdom gained from futurity,  and in its strenuous efforts to warn its present habitation--  the corporal body--of dangers just ahead, takes on the shape of a dear  one as the most effective method of imparting this knowledge.    Q.--How does subjectivity deal with time?    A.--There is no past and future to subjectivity.  It is all one living present.    Q.--If that is so, why can't you tell us accurately of our future  as you do of our past?    A.--Because events are like a procession; they pass a few at a time  and cast a shadow on subjective minds, and those which have passed  before the waking mind are felt by other minds also and necessarily  make a more lasting impression on the subjective mind.    * * * *      Q.--To illustrate:  A person on retiring or closing his eyes had a face  appear to him, the forehead well formed but the lower parts distorted.  Explain this phenomenon?    A.--A changed state from perfect sleep or waking possessed him.    Now, the man's face was only the expression of his real  thoughts and the state of his business combined.  His thoughts were strong and healthy, but his business fagging,  hence his own spirit is not a perfect likeness of his own soul,  as it takes every atom of earthly composition perfectly normal  to reproduce a perfect spirit picture of the soul or mortal man.  He would have seen a true likeness of himself had conditions  been favorable; thus a man knows when a complete whole is  his portion.  Study to make surroundings always harmonious.  Life is only being perfectly carried on when these conditions  are in unison.      HOW TO DEVELOP THE POWER TO DREAM.      Keep the mind clear and as free from material rubbish as is  possible and go to sleep in a negative condition (this will,  of course, have to be cultivated by the subject). A person can,  if he will, completely relax his mind and body to the receptive  mood required for dreams to appear as realities, or true  explanations of future events.    * * * *      To dream you are conversing with a dead relative, and that  relative endeavors to extract a promise from you, warns you  of coming distress unless you follow the advice given.  Disastrous consequences could be averted if minds could grasp  the inner workings and sight of the higher or spiritual self.  The voice of relatives is only that higher self taking form to approach  more distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane.  There is so little congeniality between common or material  natures that persons should depend more largely upon their own  subjectivity for true contentment and pleasure.    * * * *    DREAMS EXAGGERATED.      The will is suspended during sleep, so the dream mind is more a prey  to excitability than the waking mind.    Thus when images appear upon the dream vision they are frequently distorted  into hideous malformations that fill it with fear and excitement.      CONTRARY DREAMS.      The constant dwelling of the mind upon certain things distorts  their shapes upon subjectivity, thus throwing dreams in exactly  opposite channels to the waking reality.  Yet the dreamer always  feels a sense of being awake in dreams like these, and on awakening  experiences no recuperation of mind or body after such contrary dreams,  Sleep is not fully sustained while the dreamer is held by material  ideas in the subjective state.    * * * *    WHEN DREAMS ARE LESS PRESCIENT.      The cessation of the organs to perform healthful functions converts  a man into a different person, and dreams while in this state would  have no prophetic meaning, unless to warn the dreamer of this  disorganization of his physical system.    Dreams are symbols used by subjectivity to impress the objective  or material mind with a sense of coming good or evil.  Subjectivity is  the spiritual part of man.  The soul is that circle of man lying  just outside the gross materiality and partaking largely of it.  All thoughts and desires enter first the soul or material mind  and then cast themselves on the spirit.  Frequently the soul becomes  so filled with material or present ideas, that the spiritual symbols  are crowded out, and then it is that dreams seen to be contrary.  Material subjectivity, that is, all thoughts and ideas emanating  from material sources, go to make up this circle; then the mind  catches up the better thoughts of this section and weaves them  into a broader and more comprehensive power, sustaining the owner  in his own judgment.    And still another circle is formed of the finer compound of this,  which is spiritual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1,"a human being. This was done  either by walling up the victim while alive, or by mixing his or her  blood with the cement used in the walls. Often it was a virgin or a  little child thus chosen by lot and made to die, the one for the many.    The idea was not only to ward off the anger of the spirits of the air,  or to appease the dragons under ground, but also to make the workmen  do their best work faithfully, so that the foundation should be sure  and the edifice withstand the storm, the wind, and the earthquake  shocks.    So, nobody was surprised, or raised his eyebrows, or shook his head,  or pursed up his lips, when the king announced that what the wise men  declared, must be done and that quickly. Nevertheless, many a mother  hugged her darling more closely to her bosom, and fathers feared for  their sons or daughters, lest one of these, their own, should be  chosen as the victim to be slain.    King Vortigern had the long horn blown for perfect silence, and then  he spoke:    \"A child must be found who was born without a father. He must be  brought here and be solemnly put to death. Then his blood will be  sprinkled on the ground and the citadel will be built securely.\"    Within an hour, swift runners were seen bounding over the Cymric  hills. They were dispatched in search of a boy without a father, and a  large reward was promised to the young man who found what was wanted.  So into every part of the Cymric land, the searchers went.    One messenger noticed some boys playing ball. Two of them were  quarreling. Coming near, he heard one say to the other:    \"Oh, you boy without a father, nothing good will ever happen to you.\"    \"This must be the one looked for,\" said the royal messenger to  himself. So he went up to the boy, who had been thus twitted and spoke  to him thus:    \"Don't mind what he says.\" Then he prophesied great things, if he  would go along with him. The boy was only too glad to go, and the next  day the lad was brought before King Vortigern.    The workmen and their wives and children, numbering thousands, had  assembled for the solemn ceremony of dedicating the ground by shedding  the boy's blood. In strained attention the people held their breath.    The boy asked the king:    \"Why have your servants brought me to this place?\"    Then the sovereign told him the reason, and the boy asked:    \"Who instructed you to do this?\"    \"My wise men told me so to do, and even the sovereign of the land  obeys his wise councilors.\"    \"Order them to come to me, Your Majesty,\" pleaded the boy.    When the wise men appeared, the boy, in respectful manner, inquired of  them thus:    \"How was the secret of my life revealed to you? Please speak freely  and declare who it was that discovered me to you.\"    Turning to the king, the boy added:    \"Pardon my boldness, Your Majesty. I shall soon reveal the whole  matter to you, but I wish first to question your advisers. I want them  to tell you what is the real cause, and reveal, if they can, what is  hidden here underneath the ground.\"    But the wise men were confounded. They could not tell and they fully  confessed their ignorance.    The boy then said:    \"There is a pool of water down below. Please order your men to dig for  it.\"    At once the spades were plied by strong hands, and in a few minutes  the workmen saw their faces reflected, as in a looking glass. There  was a pool of clear water there.    Turning to the wise men, the boy asked before all:    \"Now tell me, what is in the pool?\"    As ignorant as before, and now thoroughly ashamed, the wise men were  silent.    \"Your Majesty, I can tell you, even if these men cannot. There are two  vases in the pool.\"    Two brave men leaped down into the pool. They felt around and brought  up two vases, as the boy had said.    Again, the lad put a question to the wise men:    \"What is in these vases?\"    Once more, those who professed to know the secrets of the world, even  to the demanding of the life of a human being, held their tongues.    \"There is a tent in them,\" said the boy. \"Separate them, and you will  find it so.\"    By the king's command, a soldier thrust in his hand and found a folded  tent.    Again, while all wondered, the boy was in command of the situation.  Everything seemed so reasonable, that all were prompt and alert to  serve him.    \"What a splendid chief and general, he would make, to lead us against  our enemies, the 'Long Knives!'\" whispered one soldier to another.    \"What is in the tent?\" asked the boy of the wise men.    Not one of the twelve knew what to say, and there was an almost  painful silence.    \"I will tell you, Your Majesty, and all here, what is in this tent.  There are two serpents, one white and one red. Unfold the tent.\"    With such a leader, no soldier was afraid, nor did a single person in  the crowd draw back? Two stalwart fellows stepped forward to open the  tent.    But now, a few of the men and many of the women shrank back while  those that had babies, or little folks, snatched up their children,  fearing lest the poisonous snakes might wriggle towards them.    The two serpents were coiled up and asleep, but they soon showed signs  of waking, and their fiery, lidless eyes glared at the people.    \"Now, Your Majesty, and all here, be you the witnesses of what will  happen. Let the King and wise men look in the tent.\"    At this moment, the serpents stretched themselves out at full length,  while all fell back, giving them a wide circle to struggle in.    Then they reared their heads. With their glittering eyes flashing  fire, they began to struggle with each other. The white one rose up  first, threw the red one into the middle of the arena, and then  pursued him to the edge of the round space.    Three times did the white serpent gain the victory over the red one.    But while the white serpent seemed to be gloating over the other for a  final onset, the red one, gathering strength, erected its head and  struck at the other.    The struggle went on for several minutes, but in the end the red  serpent overcame the white, driving it first out of the circle, then  from the tent, and into the pool, where it disappeared, while the  victorious red one moved into the tent again.    When the tent flap was opened for all to see, nothing was visible  except a red dragon; for the victorious serpent had turned into this  great creature which combined in one new form the body and the powers  of bird, beast, reptile and fish. It had wings to fly, the strongest  animal strength, and could crawl, swim, and live in either water or  air, or on the earth. In its body was the sum total of all life.    Then, in the presence of all the assembly, the youth turned to the  wise men to explain the meaning of what had happened. But not a word  did they speak. In fact, their faces were full of shame before the  great crowd.    \"Now, Your Majesty, let me reveal to you the meaning of this mystery.\"    \"Speak on,\" said the King, gratefully.    \"This pool is the emblem of the world, and the tent is that of your  kingdom. The two serpents are two dragons. The white serpent is the  dragon of the Saxons, who now occupy several of the provinces and  districts of Britain and from sea to sea. But when they invade our  soil our people will finally drive them back and hold fast forever  their beloved Cymric land. But you must choose another site, on which  to erect your castle.\"    After this, whenever a castle was to be built no more human victims  were doomed to death. All the twelve men, who had wanted to keep up  the old cruel custom, were treated as deceivers of the people. By the  King's orders, they were all put to death and buried before all the  crowd.    To-day, like so many who keep alive old and worn-out notions by means  of deception and falsehood, these men are remembered only by the  Twelve Mounds, which rise on the surface of the field hard by.    As for the boy, he became a great magician, or, as we in our age would  call him, a man of science and wisdom, named Merlin. He lived long on  the mountain, but when he went away with a friend, he placed all his  treasures in a golden cauldron and hid them in a cave. He rolled a  great stone over its mouth. Then with sod and earth he covered it all  over so as to hide it from view. His purpose was to leave this his  wealth for a leader, who, in some future generation, would use it for  the benefit of his country, when most needed.    This special person will be a youth with yellow hair and blue eyes.  When he comes to Denas, a bell will ring to invite him into the cave.  The moment his foot is over the place, the stone of entrance will open  of its own accord. Anyone else will be considered an intruder and it  will not be possible for him to carry away the treasure.          VIII      THE TOUCH OF CLAY      Long, long ago before the Cymry came into the beautiful land of Wales,  there were dark-skinned people living in caves.    In these early times there were a great many fairies of all sorts, but  of very different kinds of behavior, good and bad.    It was in this age of the world that fairies got an idea riveted into  their heads which nothing, not even hammers, chisels or crowbars can  pry up. Neither horse power, nor hydraulic force nor sixteen-inch  bombs, nor cannon balls, nor torpedoes can drive it out.    It is a settled matter of opinion in fairy land that, compared with  fairies, human beings are very stupid. The fairies think that mortals  are dull witted and awfully slow, when compared to the smarter and  more nimble fairies, that are always up to date in doing things.    Perhaps the following story will help explain why this is.    These ancient folks who lived in caves, could not possibly know some  things that are like A B C to the fairies of to-day. For the Welsh  fairies, King Puck and Queen Mab, know all about what is in the  telegraphs, submarine cables and wireless telegraphy of to-day. Puck"]]]
