As regards the use of the detecter with open lights,  several of the foregoing advantages or modifications of them will apply.  Instead of having to use the safety lamp as at present, it is thought that  the working place will be more frequently examined, for a sample of the  suspected atmosphere can be carried to a safe place and forced on to the  naked light, when, if gas be present, it simply burns at the end of the  mouthpiece like an ordinary gas jet. There are other advantages, such as  examining the return airways without exposing the lamp, etc., which will be  apparent, and become of more or less importance according to the conditions  under which the tests are made.    In conclusion, I wish to paint out that the practice adopted at some  collieries, of having all the men supplied with the most approved lamp  (such as the Mueseler or tin shield lamp) is not a safe one. If the  strength of a chain is only equal to the weakest link, it may be argued  that the safety of a mine is only equal to that of the most careless man or  most unsafe lamp in it. If, therefore, the deputies, whose duty it is to  look for gas and travel the most dangerous parts of the mine, are obliged  to use the Davy on account of its sensitiveness, may it not be said that,  as their lamps are exposed equally with the workmen's to the high  velocities of air, they are the weak links in the safety of the mine? For  the reasons given, I venture to submit that the difficulties and dangers I  have mentioned will be largely reduced, if not wholly overcome, by the use  of the fire-damp detecter.           *       *       *       *       *          CAMERA ATTACHMENT FOR PAPER PHOTO NEGATIVES.      In computing the weight of the various items for a photographic tour, the  glass almost invariably comes out at the head of the list, and the farther  or longer the journey, so much more does the weight of the plates stand out  pre-eminent; indeed, if one goes out on a trip with only three dozen  half-plates, the glass will probably weigh nearly as much as camera, backs,  and tripod, in spite of the stipulation with the maker to supply plates on  \"thin glass.\"    Next in importance to glass as a support comes paper, and it is quite easy  to understand that the tourist in out of the way parts might be able to  take an apparatus containing a roll of sensitive paper, when it would be  altogether impracticable for him to take an equivalent surface of coated  glass, and in such a case the roller slide becomes of especial value.    The roller slide of Melhuish is tolerably well known, and is, we believe,  now obtainable as an article of commerce. The slide is fitted up with two  rollers, _a a_, and the sensitive sheets, _b b_, are gummed together,  making one long band, the ends of which are gummed to pieces of paper  always kept on the rollers. The sensitive sheets are wound off the left or  reserve roller on to the right or exposed roller, until all are exposed.    [Illustration]    The rollers are supported on springs, _a a_, to render their motion  equal; they are turned by the milled heads, _m m_, and clamped when each  fresh sheet is brought into position by the nuts, _a squared a squared_. _c_, is a board  which is pressed forward by springs, _c c_, so as to hold the sheet to be  exposed, and keep it smooth against the plate of glass, _d_; when the sheet  has been exposed, the board is drawn back from the glass in order to  release the exposed sheet, and allow it to be rolled on the exposed roller;  the board is kept back while this is being done by turning the square rod,  _c squared_, half round, so that the angles of the square will not pass back  through the square opening until again turned opposite to it; _e e_ are  doors, by opening which the operator can see (through the yellow glass, _y  y_) to adjust the position of the sensitive sheets when changing them.    The remarkable similarity of such a slide to the automatic printing-frame  described last week will strike the reader; and, like the printing-frame,  it possesses the advantage of speed in working--no small consideration to  the photographer in a distant, and possibly hostile, country.    Fine paper well sized with an insoluble size and coated with a sensitive  emulsion is, we believe, the very best material to use in the roller slide;  and such a paper might be made in long lengths at a very low price, a  coating machine similar to that constructed for use in making carbon tissue  being employed. We have used such paper with success, and hope that some  manufacturer will introduce it into commerce before long. But the question  suggests itself, how are the paper negatives to be rendered transparent,  and how is the grain of the paper to be obliterated? Simply by pressure, as  extremely heavy rolling will render such paper almost as transparent as  glass, a fact abundantly demonstrated by Mr. Woodbury in his experiments on  the Photo-Filigrane process, and confirmed by some trials which we have  made.    It must be confessed that roller slide experiments which we have made with  sensitive films supported on gelatine sheets, or on such composite sheets  as the alternate rubber and collodion pellicle of Mr. Warnerke, have been  hardly satisfactory--possibly, however, from our own want of skill; while  no form of the Calotype process which we have tried has proved so  satisfactory as gelatino-bromide paper.--_Photo. News_.           *       *       *       *       *          INSTANTANEOUS PHOTO SHUTTER.      M. Audra, in the name of M. Braun, of Angouleme, has presented to the Photo  Society of France a new instantaneous shutter. The shutter is formed by a  revolving metallic disk out of which a segment has been taken. This disk is  placed in the center of the diaphragms, in order to obtain the greatest  rapidity combined with the least possible distance to travel. On the axis  to which this circular disk is fixed is a small wheel, to which is attached  a piece of string, and when the disk is turned round for the exposure the  string is wound round the wheel. If the string be pulled, naturally the  disk will revolve back to its former position so much the more quickly the  more violently the string is pulled. M. Braun has replaced the hand by a  steel spring attached to the drum of the lens (Fig. 2) By shortening or  lengthening the string, more or less rapid exposures may be obtained.

Within a short period sulphurous acid has become an important element in  the preparation of an excellent pyro developer for gelatine plates; and as  it is more or less unstable in its keeping qualities, some easy method of  preparing a small quantity which shall have a uniform strength is  desirable. A method recently described in the _Photographic News_ will  afford the amateur photographer a ready way of preparing a small quantity  of the acid.    [Illustration]    In the illustration given above, A and B are two bottles, both of which can  be closed tightly with corks. A hole is made in the cork in the bottle, A,  a little smaller than the glass tube which connects A and B. It is filed  out with a rat-tail file until it is large enough to admit the tube very  tightly. The tube may be bent easily, by being heated over a common  fish-tail gas burner or over the top of the chimney of a kerosene lamp, so  as to form two right angles, one end extending close to the bottom of the  bottle B as shown.    Having fitted up the apparatus, about two ounces of hyposulphite of soda  are placed in the bottle A, while the bottle B is about three-fourths  filled with water--distilled or melted ice water is to be preferred; some  sulphuric acid--about two ounces--is now diluted with about twice its bulk  of water, by first putting the water into a dish and pouring in the acid in  a steady stream, stirring meanwhile. It is well to set the dish in a sink,  to avoid any damage which might occur through the breaking of the dish by  the heat produced; when cool, the solution is ready for use and may be kept  in a bottle.    The cork which serves to adapt the bent tube to the bottle A is now just  removed for an instant, the other end remaining in the water in bottle B,  and about two or three ounces of the dilute acid are poured in upon the  hyposulphite, after which the cork is immediately replaced.    Sulphurous acid is now evolved by the action of the acid on the hypo, and  as the gas is generated it is led as a series of bubbles through the water  in the bottle B as shown. The air space above the water in bottle B soon  becomes filled by displacement with sulphurous acid gas, which is a little  over twice as heavy as air; so in order to expedite the complete saturation  of the water, it is convenient to remove the bottle A with its tube from  bottle B, and after having closed the latter by its cork or stopper, to  agitate it thoroughly by turning the bottle upside down. As the sulphurous  acid gas accumulated in the air space over the water is absorbed by the  water, a partial vacuum is created, and when the stopper is eased an inrush  of air may be noted. When, after passing fresh gas through the liquid for  some minutes, no further inrush of air is noted on easing the stopper as  before described after agitating the bottle, it may be concluded that the  water is thoroughly saturated with sulphurous acid and is strong enough for  immediate use. More gas can be generated by adding more dilute sulphuric  acid to the hypo until the latter is decomposed; then it should be thrown  aside, and a fresh charge put in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11740"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The following \"announcement\" is so characteristic and amusing, that we  copy it _verbatim et literatim_:--The author of \"Whims and Oddities\" has  the honour of informing the public, that, encouraged by the popularity of  the Ballads in the first and second series of that work, he intends to  communicate a succession of similar vocal crotchets, to run alone without  the help of an octavo. Sally Brown, Faithless Nelly Gray, and Mary's  Ghost, have been patronised by many public and private singers; but  unfortunately they were adapted to as many airs--sometimes even to jigs;  and the natural result was an occasional falling-out between the words  and the melodies. Judging that it would be better for those verses to be  regularly married to music, than that they should form temporary  connexions with any rambling tunes about town, Mr. J. Blewitt has at last  kindly provided them with airs that are airs of _character_, and made  their alliance with music of the correct and permanent kind. The same  gentleman has undertaken the same good office for the forthcoming Comic  Ballads; and his well-known skill and talent will insure that all unhappy  differences between Sound and Sense will be amicably composed. In fact,  the words and the airs will be intended for each other from the  cradle--like Paul and Virginia. It is intended that the new Ballads shall  start in couples. Two to make a Number, and a number of Numbers may be  _bound_ to the library, as a volume, for a term of years. The work will  be set with variations. Occasionally there will be a duet or trio, to  accommodate those timid vocalists who do not choose to make themselves  particular in a solo, or those other singers of sociable habits who  prefer giving tongue in a pack. One word about the words. They will be  \"merry and wise.\" Not a jest will be admitted that might be liable to  misconstruction by the Council of _Nice_. The Comic Muse has been too apt  to mistake liberty for _license_, and has been proportionably  _licen_tious; the Comic Ballads will be as particular as Seneca or Aesop  in their regard for good morals. Nothing, in short, will be inserted but  what is _cut out_ for the female ear. To conclude--the said Melodies will  be issued by Messrs. Clementi and Co., of Cheapside. Be sure to ask for  \"Comic Melodies,\" as all others are counterfeits, and not benefits, to  the proprietors. The first Number is expected to commence, like Blue  Bonnets, with \"March;\" and the work will be continued regularly through  every other month in the calendar.           *       *       *       *       *    The other day, a man of ninety-nine was buried at Pere-la-chaise, at  Paris, and was followed to his grave by twenty children, fifteen  grand-children and great grand-children. Happily, such populators are not  common! The deceased, it appears, had buried six wives, and married the  seventh: he died in the full enjoyment of his senses, and assured his  numerous progeny that he did not regret life, as he knew he was about to  rejoin the six beloved partners of his days, who had gone before him. Few  men, we fear, would be consoled by such an idea in their last moments, or  at any moment of their existence!--_Literary Gaz_.           *       *       *       *       *      ABERNETHYANA.

A lady went to  the doctor in great distress of mind, and stated to him, that, by a  strange accident, she had swallowed a live spider. At first, his only  reply was, \"whew! whew! whew!\" a sort of internal whistling sound,  intended to be indicative of supreme contempt. But his anxious patient  was not so easily to be repulsed. She became every moment more and more  urgent for some means of relief from the dreaded effect of the strange  accident she had consulted him about; when, at last, looking round upon  the wall, he put up his hand and caught a fly. \"There, ma'am,\" said he,  \"I've got a remedy for you. Open your mouth; and as soon as I've put this  fly into it, shut it close again; and the moment the spider hears the fly  buzzing about, up he'll come; and then you can spit them both out  together.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LISTON PLAYING MOLL FLAGGON.    _An Acrostic._        Lovesick people e'en will smile,    In spite of cares, and for the while      Sadness will not _lag on:_    Tic dolereux will lose its power    On facial nerves for half an hour,      Now Listen plays Moll Flaggon.
