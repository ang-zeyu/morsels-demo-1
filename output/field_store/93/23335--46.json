Then the rest of the Kureisch rather cravenly waited until the next day,  but seeing that no calamity had befallen Al-Welid, they were ready to  continue the work. The rebuilding prospered until they came to a point  where the Black Stone must be embedded in the eastern wall.    At this juncture a vehement dispute arose among the Kureisch as to who  was to have the honour of depositing the Black Stone in its place. They  wrangled for days, and finally decided to appeal to Mahomet, who had a  reputation for wisdom and resource. Mahomet, after carefully considering  the question, ordered a large cloth to be brought, and commanded the  representatives of the four chief Meccan houses to hold each a corner.  Then he deposited the Black Stone in the centre of it, and in this  manner, with the help of every party in the quarrel, the sacred object  was raised to the proper height. When this was done Mahomet conducted the  Black Stone to its niche in the wall with his own hand.    The building of the Kaaba was ultimately completed, and a great  festival was held in honour. Many hymns of praise were sung at the  accomplishment of so difficult and important a work. The Kaaba has  remained substantially the same as it was when it was first rebuilt. It  is a small place of no architectural pretensions, merely a square with no  windows, and a tiny door raised from the ground, by which the Faithful,  duly prepared, are allowed to enter upon rare occasions. The sacred Black  Stone lies embedded about three feet from the ground in the eastern wall,  at first a dark greenish stone of volcanic or aerolitic origin, now worn  black and polished by thousands of kisses. There is little in the Kaaba  to account for the reverence bestowed upon it, and its insignificance  bears witness to the Eastern capacity for worshipping the idea for which  its symbols stand. This was the sacred temple of Abraham and Ishmael,  therefore its exterior mattered little.    Mahomet's share in the construction of the Kaaba brought him further  honour among the Kureisch. From this time until the beginning of his  mission he lived a quiet, easeful domestic life, interrupted only by  mental storms and depressions. He found leisure to meditate and observe,  and of this necessarily uneventful time there is little or no mention in  the histories. He certainly gained an opportunity of examining somewhat  closely the tenets of Christianity by the entrance into his household of  Zeid, a Christian slave, cultured and well-informed as to the doctrines  of his religion, and his presence doubtless influenced Mahomet in the  spiritual battles he encountered at a time when as yet he was certain  neither of God nor himself. Besides Zeid another important personage  entered Mahomet's household, Ali, son of Abu Talib, and future convert  and pride of Islam, \"the lion of the Faith.\" The adoption of Ali was  Mahomet's small recompense to Abu Talib for his care of him, and the  advantages there from to Islam were inestimable. Ali was no statesman,  but he was an indomitable fighter, with whose aid Mahomet founded his  religion of the sword.    In such quiet manner Mahomet passed the years immediately preceding the  discovery of his mission, and as religious doubts and fears alternated in  him with fervour and hopefulness, so signs were not wanting of a spirit  of inquiry found abroad in Arabia, discontented with the old religions,  seeking for a clearer enthusiasm and withheld from its goal. Legends  gather round the figures of four inquirers who are reputed to have come  to Mahomet for enlightenment, and the story is but the primitive device  of rendering concrete and material all those vague stirrings of the  communal spirit towards a more convincing conception of the world--  legends that embody ideas in personalities, mainly because their language  has no words for the expression of the abstract, and also that, clothed  in living garments, they may capture the hearts of men. The time for the  coming of a prophet and a teacher could not be long delayed, and a  foreboding of his imperious destiny, dark with war and aflame with God's  judgment, had already begun to steal across Mahomet's hesitant soul.          CHAPTER V      INSPIRATION        \"Recite thou in the name of thy Lord who created,    Yan, who hath made man from Clots of Blood,    Recite thou, for thy Lord, he is most bounteous.\"    _The Kuran_.    The mental growth by which Mahomet attained the capacity of Prophet and  ruler will always have spread about it a misty veil, wherein strange  shapes and awful visions are dimly discerned. Did his soul face the  blankness that baffles and entices the human spirit with any convictions,  the gradual products of thought and experience, or was it with an  unmeaning chaos within him that he stumbled into faith and evolved his  own creed? His knowledge of Christianity and Judaism undoubtedly helped  to foster in him his central idea of the indivisibility of God. But how  was this faith wrought out into his conception of himself as the Prophet  of his people?    It is impossible for any decision to be made as to the mainspring of his  beliefs, except in the light of his character and development of mind. He  was passionate and yet practical, holding within himself the elements of  seer and statesman, prophet and law-giver, as yet doubtful of the voice  which inspired him, but spurred on in his quest for the truth by an  intensity of spirit that carried him forward resistlessly as soon as  conviction came to him. The man who imposed his dauntless determination  upon a whole people, who founded a system of religious and social laws,  who moved armies to fight primarily for an idea, could not lightly gain  is right to exhort and control. His nature is almost cataclysmic, and  once filled with the fire of the Lord, he bursts forth among his  fellow-men \"with the right hand striking,\" to use his own vivid metaphor,  but before this evidence of power has come an agonising period of doubt.    Traces of his mental turmoil are seen abundantly in his physical nature.  We read of his exhaustion after the inspiration comes, and of \"the  terrific Suras\" that took their toll of his vitality afterwards. The  mission imposed upon him was no light burden, and demanded of him  strength both of body and mind. The successive stages by which he became  convinced of his divine call are only detailed in the histories with the  concurrence of the supernatural; he sees material visions and dreams  fervent dreams. With the ecstacy of Heaven about him, according to  legend, he holds converse with the angel Gabriel, arch-messenger of God,  and the divine injunctions must be translated into mental enthusiasms  before the true evolution of Mahomet's mind can be dimly conceived.    When he was forty he sought solitude more constantly than formerly. There  were deeps in his own nature of which he was only now becoming aware. A  restlessness of mind beset him, and continually he retired to a cave at  the base of Mount Hira, where he could meditate undisturbed. This  mountain, hallowed for ever by the followers of Islam, is now called  somewhat ironically, considering its natural barrenness, Jebel Nur, the  mountain of Light. Mahomet was of a nervous temperament, the nature that  suffers more intensely through its imaginative foresight than in actual  experience. He was of those who see keenly and feel towards their  beliefs. His faith in God produced none of that self-abnegating  rapture to be found in the devotions of many early Christians; it was a  personal passion, sweeping up his whole nature within its folds, and  rousing the enfolded not to meditation but to instant action.    Through all the legendary accounts there beats that excitement that tells  of a mind wrought to the highest pitch, afire with visions, alive with  desire. Then, when his fervour attained its zenith, Gabriel came to him  in sleep with a silken cloth in his hand covered with writing and said to  Mahomet:    \"Read!\"    \"I cannot read.\"    Then the angel wrapped the cloth about him and once more commanded,  \"Read!\"    Again came the answer, \"I cannot read,\" and again the angel covered him,  still repeating, \"Read!\"    Then his mouth was opened and he read the first sura of the Kuran:  \"Recite thou in the name of thy Lord who created thee,\" and when he awoke  it seemed to him that these words were graven upon his heart.    Mahomet went immediately up into the mountain, and there Gabriel appeared  to him waking and said:    \"Thou art God's Prophet, and I am Gabriel.\"    The archangel vanished, but Mahomet remained rooted to the spot, until  Khadijah's messengers found him and brought him to her. The simple story  of Mahomet's call to the prophetic office from the lips of the old  chroniclers is peculiarly fragrant, but it leaves us in considerable  doubt as to the real means by which he attained his faith and was  emboldened to preach to his people. It is certain that he had no idea at  the time when he received his inspiration, of the ultimate political role  in store for him. He was now simply the man who warned the people of  their sins, and who insisted upon the sovereignty of one God. Very little  argument is ever used by Mahomet to spread his faith. He spoke a plain  message, and those who disregarded it were infallibly doomed. He saw  himself in the forefront as the man who knew God, and strove to win his  countrymen to right ways of life; he did not see himself at the head of  earthly armies, controlling the nucleus of a mighty and united Arabia,  and until his flight from Mecca to Medina he regarded himself merely as a  religious teacher, the political side of his mission growing out of the  exigencies of circumstance, almost without his own volition.    His exaltation upon the mountain of light soon faded into uncertainty and  fearfulness before the influence of the world's harsh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#8)"],[1,"dumping kegs down on  the ground, with a swish of liquor inside them, and then the noise of  casks being moved.    'I thought we should have a fall there ere long,' Ratsey went on, 'what  with this drought parching the ground, and the trampling at the edge when  we move out the side stone to get in, but there is no mischief done  beyond what can be easily made good. A gravestone or two and a few spades  of earth will make all sound again. Leave that to me.'    'Be careful what you do,' rejoined another man's voice that I did not  know, 'lest someone see you digging, and scent us out.'    'Make your mind easy,' Ratsey said; 'I have dug too often in this  graveyard for any to wonder if they see me with a spade.'    Then the conversation broke off, and there was little more talking, only  a noise of men going backwards and forwards, and of putting down of kegs  and the hollow gurgle of good liquor being poured from breakers into the  casks. By and by fumes of brandy began to fill the air, and climb to  where I lay, overcoming the mouldy smell of decayed wood and the dampness  of the green walls. It may have been that these fumes mounted to my head,  and gave me courage not my own, but so it was that I lost something of  the stifling fear that had gripped me, and could listen with more ease to  what was going forward. There was a pause in the carrying to and fro;  they were talking again now, and someone said--    'I was in Dorchester three days ago, and heard men say it will go hard  with the poor chaps who had the brush with the _Elector_ last summer.  Judge Barentyne comes on Assize next week, and that old fox Maskew has  driven down to Taunton to get at him before and coach him back; making  out to him that the Law's arm is weak in these parts against the  contraband, and must be strengthened by some wholesome hangings.'    'They are a cruel pair,' another put in, 'and we shall have new gibbets on  Ridgedown for leading lights. Once I get even with Maskew, the other may  go hang, ay, and they may hang me too.'    'The Devil send him to meet me one dark night on the down alone,' said  someone else, 'and I will give him a pistol's mouth to look down, and  spoil his face for him.'    'No, thou wilt not,' said a deep voice, and then I knew that Elzevir was  there too; 'none shall lay hand on Maskew but I. So mark that, lad, that  when his day of reckoning comes, 'tis _I_ will reckon with him.'    Then for a few minutes I did not pay much heed to what was said, being  terribly straitened for room, and cramped with pain from lying so long in  one place. The thick smoke from the pitch torches too came curling across  the roof and down upon me, making me sick and giddy with its evil smell  and taste; and though all was very dim, I could see my hands were black  with oily smuts. At last I was able to wriggle myself over without making  too much noise, and felt a great relief in changing sides, but gave such  a start as made the coffin creak again at hearing my own name.    'There is a boy of Trenchard's,' said a voice that I thought was  Parmiter's, who lived at the bottom of the village--'there is a boy of  Trenchard's that I mistrust; he is for ever wandering in the graveyard,  and I have seen him a score of times sitting on this tomb and looking out  to sea. This very night, when the wind fell at sundown, and we were hung  up with sails flapping, three miles out, and waited for the dark to get  the sweeps, I took my glass to scan the coast-line, and lo, here on the  tomb-top sits Master Trenchard. I could not see his face, but knew him by  his cut, and fear the boy sits there to play the spy and then tells  Maskew.'    'You're right,' said Greening of Ringstave, for I knew his  slow drawl; 'and many a time when I have sat in The Wood, and watched the  Manor to see Maskew safe at home before we ran a cargo, I have seen this  boy too go round about the place with a hangdog look, scanning the house  as if his life depended on't.'    'Twas very true what Greening said; for of a summer evening I would take  the path that led up Weatherbeech Hill, behind the Manor; both because  'twas a walk that had a good prospect in itself, and also a sweet charm  for me, namely, the hope of seeing Grace Maskew. And there I often sat  upon the stile that ends the path and opens on the down, and watched the  old half-ruined house below; and sometimes saw white-frocked Gracie  walking on the terrace in the evening sun, and sometimes in returning  passed her window near enough to wave a greeting. And once, when she had  the fever, and Dr. Hawkins came twice a day to see her, I had no heart  for school, but sat on that stile the livelong day, looking at the gabled  house where she was lying ill. And Mr. Glennie never rated me for playing  truant, nor told Aunt Jane, guessing, as I thought afterwards, the cause,  and having once been young himself. 'Twas but boy's love, yet serious for  me; and on the day she lay near death, I made so bold as to stop Dr.  Hawkins on his horse and ask him how she did; and he bearing with me for  the eagerness that he read in my face, bent down over his saddle and  smiled, and said my playmate would come back to me again.    So it was quite true that I had watched the house, but not as a spy, and  would not have borne tales to old Maskew for anything that could be  offered. Then Ratsey spoke up for me and said--''Tis a false scent. The  boy is well enough, and simple, and has told me many a time he seeks the  churchyard because there is a fine view to be had there of the sea, and  'tis the sea he loves. A month ago, when the high tide set, and this  vault was so full of water that we could not get in, I came with Elzevir  to make out if the floods were going down inside, or what eddy 'twas that  set the casks tapping one against another. So as I lay on the ground with  my ear glued close against the wall, who should march round the church  but John Trenchard, Esquire, not treading delicately like King Agag, or  spying, but just come on a voyage of discovery for himself. For in the  church on Sunday, when we heard the tapping in the vault below, my young  gentleman was scared enough; but afterwards, being told by Parson  Glennie--who should know better--that such noises were not made by  ghosts, but by the Mohunes at sea in their coffins, he plucks up heart,  and comes down on the Monday to see if they are still afloat. So there he  caught me lying like a zany on the ground. You may guess I stood at  attention soon enough, but told him I was looking at the founds to see if  they wanted underpinning from the floods. And so I set his mind at ease,  for 'tis a simple child, and packed him off to get my dubbing hammer. And  I think the boy will not be here so often now to frighten honest  Parmiter, for I have weaved him some pretty tales of Blackbeard, and he  has a wholesome scare of meeting the Colonel. But after dark I pledge my  life that neither he nor any other in the town would pass the churchyard  wall, no, not for a thousand pounds.'    I heard him chuckling to himself, and the others laughed loudly too, when  he was telling how he palmed me off; but 'he laughs loudest who laughs  last', thought I, and should have chuckled too, were it not for making  the coffin creak. And then, to my surprise, Elzevir spoke: 'The lad is  a brave lad; I would he were my son. He is David's age, and will make a  good sailor later on.'    They were simple words, yet pleasing to me; for Elzevir spoke as if he  meant them, and I had got to like him a little in spite of all his  grimness; and beside that, was sorry for his grief over his son. I was so  moved by what he said, that for a moment I was for jumping up and calling  out to him that I lay here and liked him well, but then thought better of  it, and so kept still.    The carrying was over, and I fancy they were all sitting on the ends of  kegs or leaning up against the pile; but could not see, and was still  much troubled with the torch smoke, though now and then I caught through  it a whiff of tobacco, which showed that some were smoking.    Then Greening, who had a singing voice for all his drawl, struck up  with--    Says the Cap'n to the crew,  We have slipt the revenue,    but Ratsey stopped him with a sharp 'No more of that; the words aren't  to our taste tonight, but come as wry as if the parson called _Old  Hundred_ and I tuned up with _Veni_.' I knew he meant the last verse  with a hanging touch in it; but Greening was for going on with the song,  until some others broke in too, and he saw that the company would have  none of it.    'Not but what the labourer is worthy of his hire,' went on Master Ratsey;  'so spile that little breaker of Schiedam, and send a rummer round to  keep off midnight chills.'    He loved a glass of the good liquor well, and with him 'twas always the  same reasoning, namely, to keep off chills; though he chopped the words  to suit the season, and now 'twas autumn, now winter, now spring, or  summer chills.    They must have found glasses, though I could not remember to have seen  any in the vault, for a minute later fugleman Ratsey spoke again--    'Now, lads, glasses full and bumpers for a toast. And here's to  Blackbeard, to Father Blackbeard, who watches over our treasure better  than he did over his own; for were it not the fear of him that keeps off  idle feet and prying eyes, we should have the gaugers in, and our store  ransacked twenty times.'    So he spoke, and it seemed there was a little halting at first, as of  men not liking to take Blackbeard's name in Blackbeard's place, or raise  the Devil by mocking at him. But then some of the bolder shouted  'Blackbeard', and so the more timid chimed in, and in a minute there  were a score of voices calling 'Blackbeard, Blackbeard', till the place  rang again.    Then Elzevir cried out angrily, 'Silence. Are you mad, or has the liquor  mastered you? Are you Revenue-men that you"]]]
