The President, M.  Dupin, pronounced an affecting eulogy upon the deceased, which was  received with the liveliest sympathy by the Chamber, and was ordered  to be recorded in its journal. A compliment like this is totally  unprecedented in France, and the death of no other foreigner in the  world could have elicited it.           *       *       *       *       *    BOYER, EX-PRESIDENT OF HAYTI.    Jean Pierre Boyer, a mulatto, distinguished in affairs, and for his  abilities and justice, was born at Port-au-Prince, on the 6th of  February, 1776. His father, by some said to have been of mixed blood,  was a tailor and shopkeeper, of fair reputation and some property, and  his mother a negress from Congo in Africa, who had been a slave in  the neighborhood. He joined the French Commissioners, Santhonax and  Polverel, in whose company, after the arrival of the English, he  withdrew to Jacqemel. Here he attached himself to Rigaud, set out  with him to France, and was captured on his passage by the Americans,  during the war between France and the United States. Being released  at the end of the war, he proceeded to Paris, where he remained until  the organization of Le Clerc's expedition against St. Domingo. This  expedition he with many other persons of color joined; but on the  death of Le Clerc he attached himself to the party of Petion, with  whom he acted during the remainder of that chieftain's life, which  terminated on the 29th of March, 1818. Under Petion he rose from  the post of aid-de-camp and private secretary to be general of  the arrondissement of Port-au-Prince; and Petion named him for  the succession in the Presidency, to which he was inducted without  opposition. When the revolution broke out in the northern part of the  island, in 1820, Boyer was invited by the insurgents to place himself  at their head; and on the death of Christophe, the northern and  southern parts of the island were united under his administration  into one government, under the style of the Republic of Hayti. In  the following year the Spanish inhabitants of the eastern part of the  island voluntarily placed themselves under the government of Boyer,  who thus became, chiefly by the force of character, without much  positive effort, the undisputed master of all St. Domingo.    It is not questionable that the productions and general prosperity of  the island decreased under Boyer's administration. The blacks needed  the stringent policy of some such tyrant as Christophe. And the  popularity of Boyer was greatly lessened by his approval or direct  negotiation of a treaty with France, by which he agreed to pay to  that country an indemnity of 150,000,000 of francs, in five annual  instalments. The French Government recognized the independence of  Hayti, but it was impossible for Boyer to meet his engagements. He  however conducted the administration with industry, discretion, and  repose, for fifteen years, when a long-slumbering opposition, for  his presumed preference of the mulatto to the black population in the  dispensations of government favor, began to exhibit itself openly.  When this feeling was manifested in the second chamber of the  Legislature, in 1843, the promptness and decision with which he  attempted to suppress it, induced an insurrection among the troops,  and he was compelled to fly, with about thirty followers, to Jamaica.  He afterward proceeded to London, and finally to Paris, where he lived  quietly in the Rue de Madeline, enjoying the respect of many eminent  men, and surrounded by attached followers who shared his exile, until  the 10th of July. On the 12th he was buried with appropriate funeral  honors.           *       *       *       *       *    THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE.    The death of the Duke of Cambridge, brother of the late William IV.,  occurred the 8th of July, and was quite sudden. He was the seventh  son of George III., was born in 1774, received his earliest education  at Kew, and finished his studies at Gottingen. He entered the army,  and experiencing much active service, was promoted, until in 1813 he  attained the distinction of Field Marshal. He soon afterward became  Governor-General of Hanover, and continued to fill that post until  the accession of the Duke of Cumberland, in 1839. His subsequent life  presented few features of much interest. His name was to be found as  a patron and a contributor to many most valuable institutions, and  he took delight in presiding at benevolent festivals and anniversary  dinners, when, though without the slightest pretension to eloquence,  the frankness and _bonhommie_ of his manners, and his simple  straight-forward earnestness of speech, used to make him an universal  favorite. He took but little part in the active strife of parties. He  died in his seventy-seventh year, leaving one son, Prince George of  Cambridge, and two daughters.           *       *       *       *       *    GEORGE W. ERVING.    This distinguished public man died in New York, on the 22d ult. A  correspondent of the _Evening Post_ gives the following account of his  history:    \"The journals furnish us with a brief notice of the death of the  venerable George W. Erving, who was for so many years, dating from the  foundation of our government, connected with the diplomatic history of  the country, as an able, successful and distinguished negotiator. The  career of this gentleman has been so marked, and is so instructive,  that it becomes not less a labor of love than an act of public duty,  with the press, to make it the occasion of comment. At the breaking  out of our revolution, the father of the subject of this imperfect  sketch was an eminent loyalist of Massachusetts, residing in Boston,  connected by affinity with the Shirleys, the Winslows, the Bowdons,  and Winthrops of that State. Like many other men of wealth, at that  day, he joined the royal cause, forsook his country and went to  England. There his son, George William, who had always been a sickly  delicate child, reared with difficulty, was educated, and finally  graduated at Oxford, where he was a classmate of Copley, now Lord  Lyndhurst. Following this, on the attainment of his majority, and  during the lifetime of his father, notwithstanding the most powerful  and seductive efforts to attach him to the side of Great Britain,  the more persevering from the great wealth, and the intellectual  attainments of the young American--notwithstanding the importunities  of misjudging friends and relatives, the incitements found in ties of  consanguinity with some, and his intimate personal associations with  many of the young nobility at that aristocratic seat of learning, and  notwithstanding the blandishments of fashionable society--the love of  country and the holy inspirations of patriotism, triumphed over all  the arts that power could control, and those allurements usually so  potent where youth is endowed with great wealth. The young patriot  promptly, cheerfully, sacrificed all, for his country--turned his back  upon the unnatural stepmother, and came back, to share the good or  evil fortunes of his native land.    \"Such facts as these should not be lost sight of at the present  day--such an example it is well to refer to now, in the day of our  prosperity. And we would ask--in no ill-natured or censorious spirit,  but rather that the lessons of history should not be forgotten--how  many young men of these days under like circumstances, would make  a similar sacrifice upon the altar of their country? The solemn and  impressive event which has produced this notice seems to render this  question not entirely inappropriate; for years should not dim in the  minds of the rising generation the memory of those pure and strong  men, who, in the early trials of their country, rose equal to the  occasion. When, at a later period, political parties began to develop  themselves, Mr. Erving, then a resident of Boston, identified himself  with the great republican party, and became actively instrumental in  securing the election of Thomas Jefferson to the Presidency. From  that time forward until the day of his death, he never faltered in his  political faith.    \"Few men have been, for so long a period, so intimately connected with  the diplomatic history of our country. He received his first public  appointment, as Consul and Commissioner of Claims at London, nearly  half a century since. This appointment was conferred upon him without  his solicitation, and was at first declined. Subsequent reflection,  however, induced him to waive all private and personal considerations,  and he accepted the post assigned to him. The manner in which he  discharged the duties of that trust, impressed the government with the  expediency of securing his services in more important negotiations,  and he was sent as Commissioner and Charge d'Affaires to Denmark. His  mission to the court of that country was, at that period, a highly  important one. The negotiations he had to conduct there, required  great tact and ability.    \"While at Copenhagen, he secured, in an eminent degree, the esteem  and confidence of the Danish authorities, and brought to a successful  solution the questions then arising out of the interests committed to  him. In consequence, the government was enabled to avail itself of  his experience at the Court of Berlin, where events seemed to require  the exercise of great diplomatic ability. He was afterward appointed  to Madrid, where, by his highly honorable personal character, and  captivating manners, he obtained great influence, even at that most  proud and distrustful court, and conducted, with consummate skill and  marked success, the important and delicate negotiations then pending  between the United States and Spain. He remained at Madrid for many  years, where he attained the reputation of being one of the most able  and accomplished diplomatists that the United "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#8)"],[1,"Viny,          Winy,          Twiny,          Viny,        Twisty-twiny,        Little vine!
