Lord Dorset used to say of a very goodnatured, dull fellow, \"'Tis a  thousand pities that man is not illnatured! that one might kick him out  of company.\"           *       *       *       *       *      NATIONAL COMPLAINTS.    The Englishmen at Paris find fault with the _French roast beef_; the  Frenchmen in London complain of the _British brandy_.    The English who visit Paris, imagine that the tavern-keepers have served  in the _cavalry_, as they are so expert in _making a charge_.    A foreigner inquiring the way to a friend's lodging, whom he said lived  at _Mr. Bailey's, senior_, was shown to the _Old Bailey_, by a  Bow-street officer. When he entered the court he imagined that it was  his friend's levee.           *       *       *       *       *      BENEFIT OF CORRECTION.    A certain bishop declared one day, that the punishment used in schools  did not make boys a whit better, or more tractable; it was insisted that  whipping was of the utmost service, for every one must allow it made a  boy _smart_.           *       *       *       *       *      FRENCH AND ENGLISH.    \"_C'est la Soupe_,\" says one of the best of proverbs, \"_qui fait le  Soldat_;\" \"It is the soup that makes the soldier.\" Excellent as our  troops are in the field, there cannot be a more unquestionable fact,  than their immense inferiority to the French in the business of cookery.  The English soldier lays his piece of ration beef at once on the coals,  by which means, the one and the better half is lost, and the other burnt  to a cinder. Whereas six French troopers fling their messes into the  same pot, and extract a delicious soup, ten times more nutritious than  the simple _Roti_ could ever be.           *       *       *       *       *      THE FAMILY SUIT.    The son-in-law of a chancery barrister having succeeded to the lucrative  practice of the latter, came one morning in breathless ecstasy to inform  him that he had succeeded in bringing nearly to its termination, a cause  which had been pending in the court of scruples for several years.  Instead of obtaining the expected congratulations of the retired veteran  of the law, his intelligence was received with indignation. \"It was by  this suit,\" exclaimed he, \"that my father was enabled to provide for me,  and to portion your wife, and with the exercise of common prudence it  would have furnished you with the means of providing handsomely for your  children and grand-children.\"           *       *       *       *       *      PORK CHOPS.    It is related, that Fuseli, the celebrated artist, when he wished to  summon Nightmare, and bid her sit for her picture, or any other  grotesque or horrible personations, was wont to prime himself for the  feat by supping on about three pounds of half-dressed pork-chops.           *       *       *       *       *      ARDUOUS BAPTISM.    An infant was brought for baptism into a country church. The clergyman,  who had just been drinking with his friends a more than usual quantum of  the genial juice, could not find the place of the baptism in his ritual,  and exclaimed, as he was turning over the leaves of the book, \"How  difficult this child is to baptize!\"           *       *       *       *       *      DULL READING.    St. Jerome says, that there is no book so dull, but it meets a suitable  dull reader. \"_Nullus est imperitus scriptor, qui lectorem non  inveniat_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      _Printed and Published by J.

They wrought in various metals; they spun and wove, navigated  rivers in sailboats, and fought with bows, lances, and swords. They had  clear perceptions of the rights of property, which were based on land.  Their morals were simple and pure, and they had strong natural  affections. Polygamy was unknown among them. They had no established  sacerdotal priesthood. They worshipped the powers of Nature, especially  fire, the source of light and heat, which they so much needed in their  dreary land. Authorities differ as to their primeval religion, some  supposing that it was monotheistic, and others polytheistic, and others  again pantheistic.    Most of the ancient nations were controlled more or less by priests,  who, as their power increased, instituted a caste to perpetuate their  influence. Whether or not we hold the primitive religion of mankind to  have been a pure theism, directly revealed by God,--which is my own  conviction,--it is equally clear that the form of religion recorded in  the earliest written records of poetry or legend was a worship of the  sun and moon and planets. I believe this to have been a corruption of  original theism; many think it to have been a stage of upward growth in  the religious sense of primitive man. In all the ancient nations the  sun-god was a prominent deity, as the giver of heat and light, and hence  of fertility to the earth. The emblem of the sun was fire, and hence  fire was deified, especially among the Hindus, under the name of  Agni,--the Latin _ignis_.    Fire, caloric, or heat in some form was, among the ancient nations,  supposed to be the _animus mundi_. In Egypt, as we have seen, Osiris,  the principal deity, was a form of Ra, the sun-god. In Assyria, Asshur,  the substitute for Ra, was the supreme deity. In India we find Mitra,  and in Persia Mithra, the sun-god, among the prominent deities, as  Helios was among the Greeks, and Phoebus Apollo among the Romans. The  sun was not always the supreme divinity, but invariably held one of the  highest places in the Pagan pantheon.    It is probable that the religion of the common progenitors of the  Hindus, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Kelts, Teutons, and Slavs, in their  hard and sterile home in Central Asia, was a worship of the powers of  Nature verging toward pantheism, although the earliest of the Vedas  representing the ancient faith seem to recognize a supreme power and  intelligence--God--as the common father of the race, to whom prayers and  sacrifices were devoutly offered. Freeman Clarke quotes from Mueller's  \"Ancient Sanskrit Literature\" one of the hymns in which the unity of God  is most distinctly recognized:--    \"In the beginning there arose the Source of golden light. He was the  only Lord of all that is. He established the earth and sky. Who is the  God to whom we shall offer our sacrifices? It is he who giveth life, who  giveth strength, who governeth all men; through whom heaven was  established, and the earth created.\"    But if the Supreme God whom we adore was recognized by this ancient  people, he was soon lost sight of in the multiplied manifestations of  his power, so that Rawlinson thinks[2] that when the Aryan race  separated in their various migrations, which resulted in what we call  the Indo-European group of races, there was no conception of a single  supreme power, from whom man and nature have alike their origin, but  Nature-worship, ending in an extensive polytheism,--as among the  Assyrians and Egyptians.    [Footnote 2: Religions of the Ancient World, p. 105.]    As to these Aryan migrations, we do not know when a large body crossed  the Himalaya Mountains, and settled on the banks of the Indus, but  probably it was at least two thousand years before Christ. Northern  India had great attractions to those hardy nomadic people, who found it  so difficult to get a living during the long winters of their primeval  home. India was a country of fruits and flowers, with an inexhaustible  soil, favorable to all kinds of production, where but little manual  labor was required,--a country abounding in every kind of animals, and  every kind of birds; a land of precious stones and minerals, of hills  and valleys, of majestic rivers and mountains, with a beautiful climate  and a sunny sky. These Aryan conquerors drove before them the aboriginal  inhabitants, who were chiefly Mongolians, or reduced them to a degrading  vassalage. The conquering race was white, the conquered was dark, though  not black; and this difference of color was one of the original causes  of Indian caste.    It was some time after the settlement of the Aryans on the banks of the  Indus and the Ganges before the Vedas were composed by the poets, who as  usual gave form to religious belief, as they did in Persia and Greece.  These poems, or hymns, are pantheistic. \"There is no recognition,\" says  Monier Williams, \"of a Supreme God disconnected with the worship of  Nature.\" There was a vague and indefinite worship of the Infinite under  various names, such as the sun, the sky, the air, the dawn, the winds,  the storms, the waters, the rivers, which alike charmed and terrified,  and seemed to be instinct with life and power. God was in all things,  and all things in God; but there was no idea of providential agency or  of personality.    In the Vedic hymns the number of gods is not numerous, only  thirty-three. The chief of these were Varuna, the sky; Mitra, the sun;  and Indra, the storm: after these, Agni, fire; and Soma, the moon. The  worship of these divinities was originally simple, consisting of prayer,  praise, and offerings. There were no temples and no imposing  sacerdotalism, although the priests were numerous. \"The prayers and  praises describe the wisdom, power, and goodness of the deity  addressed,\" [3] and when the customary offerings had been made, the  worshipper prayed for food, life, health, posterity, wealth, protection,  happiness, whatever the object was,--generally for outward prosperity  rather than for improvement in character, or for forgiveness of sin,  peace of mind, or power to resist temptation. The offerings to the gods  were propitiatory, in the form of victims, or libations of some juice.  Nor did these early Hindus take much thought of a future life. There is  nothing in the Rig-Veda of a belief in the transmigration of souls[4],  although the Vedic bards seem to have had some hope of immortality. \"He  who gives alms,\" says one poet, \"goes to the highest place in heaven: he  goes to the gods[5].... Where there is eternal light, in the world where  the sun is placed,--in that immortal, imperishable world, place me, O  Soma! ... Where there is happiness and delight, where joy and pleasures  reside, where the desires of our heart are attained, there make me  immortal.\"    [Footnote 3: Rawlinson, p. 121.]  [Footnote 4: Wilson: Rig-Veda, vol. iii. p. 170.]  [Footnote 5: Mueller: Chips from a German Workshop, vol. i. p. 46.]    In the oldest Vedic poems there were great simplicity and joyousness,  without allusion to those rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices which formed  so prominent a part of the religion of India at a later period.    Four hundred years after the Rig-Veda was composed we come to the  Brahmanic age, when the laws of Menu were written, when the Aryans were  living in the valley of the Ganges, and the caste system had become  national. The supreme deity is no longer one of the powers of Nature,  like Mitra or Indra, but according to Menu he is Brahm, or Brahma,--\"an  eternal, unchangeable, absolute being, the soul of all beings, who,  having willed to produce various beings from his own divine substance,  created the waters and placed in them a productive seed. The seed became  an egg, and in that egg he was born, but sat inactive for a year, when  he caused the egg to divide itself; and from its two divisions he framed  the heaven above, and the earth beneath. From the supreme soul Brahma  drew forth mind, existing substantially, though unperceived by the  senses; and before mind, the reasoning power, he produced consciousness,  the internal monitor; and before them both he produced the great  principle of the soul.... The soul is, in its substance, from Brahma  himself, and is destined finally to be resolved into him. The soul,  then, is simply an emanation from Brahma; but it will not return unto  him at death necessarily, but must migrate from body to body, until it  is purified by profound abstraction and emancipated from all desires.\"    This is the substance of the Hindu pantheism as taught by the laws of  Menu. It accepts God, but without personality or interference with the  world's affairs,--not a God to be loved, scarcely to be feared, but a  mere abstraction of the mind.    The theology which is thus taught in the Brahmanical Vedas, it would  seem, is the result of lofty questionings and profound meditation on the  part of the Indian sages or priests, rather than the creation of poets.    In the laws of Menu, intended to exalt the Brahmanical caste, we read,  as translated by Sir William Jones:--    \"To a man contaminated by sensuality, neither the Vedas, nor liberality,  nor sacrifices, nor strict observances, nor pious austerities, ever  procure felicity.... Let not a man be proud of his rigorous devotion;  let him not, having sacrificed, utter a falsehood; having made a  donation, let him never proclaim it.... By falsehood the sacrifice  becomes vain; by pride the merit of devotion is lost.... Single is each  man born, single he dies, single he receives the reward of the good, and  single the punishment of his evil, deeds.... By forgiveness of injuries  the learned are purified; by liberality, those who have neglected their  duty; by pious meditation, those who have secret thoughts; by devout  austerity, those who best know the Vedas.... Bodies are cleansed by  water; the mind is purified by truth; the vital spirit, by theology and"]]]
