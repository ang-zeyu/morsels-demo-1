She begged the chief's pardon  for her boldness and made known her errand. The chief was astonished,  but agreed to ask his daughter if she were willing to take Shell for  a husband. Much to his surprise and anger she stated that she was  willing to marry him. Her father was so enraged that he exclaimed:  \"I consider you as being lower than my servants. If you marry this  Shell I will drive you out of the village.\" But Shell and the girl  were married, and escaped from the town to a little house in the  fields, where they lived in great sorrow for a week. But at the end  of that time, one night at midnight, the shell began to turn into a  good-looking man, for he had been enchanted at his birth by an evil  spirit. When his wife saw how handsome he was, she was very glad,  and afterwards the chief received them back into his favor.      CHAPTER 10    The Three Brothers.    Once upon a time there was a great king who had three sons. The oldest  was named Pedro, the next Pablo, and the youngest Juan. One day their  father called them to him, and giving each one a small sum of money,  said: \"Go and seek for yourselves wives, for I am getting old and  wish to see you settled down before I die. The one who gets the most  beautiful wife shall have the kingdom. In addition to the money I  have given you, you may each have a horse from my stables.\"    Pedro and Pablo rushed off and secured the best horses, so that when  Juan, who had stopped to thank his father, arrived at the stable,  he found only an old horse, scarcely able to walk. However, he  determined to set out; but after getting a mile or so from home, he  saw that it was impossible to go farther, so sat down on a well-curb  and wept bitterly. While he was weeping, a frog floated to the top of  the water and asked what the matter was, and Juan told him all about  his trouble. The frog said: \"Never mind. Go to sleep for an hour and  I will look for a wife for you.\"    At the end of the hour the frog awoke Juan and said: \"Go home now,  and tell your father that you have found a wife.\" Juan did so,  and found his brothers at home, each claiming to have found a  wife. Their father said: \"I wish to test your wives. Here are three  handkerchiefs. Each of you must take one of them to his bride and  have it embroidered.\" They took the handkerchiefs and departed; but  Juan, when he had arrived at the well, sat down as before and wept,  because he thought that now he would surely be found out.    The frog floated again to the surface of the well and asked Juan  what the matter was. Juan replied, \"I told my father that I had  found a wife, as you bade me, and now he wishes to test my wife,  to see if she is a suitable mate for me, and has sent me with this  handkerchief for her to embroider. I do not know what to do, for now  my father will surely find out that I have deceived him, and I shall be  disgraced.\" The frog said: \"Do not worry. Give me your handkerchief and  go to sleep for an hour and I will have it embroidered for you.\" At  the end of the hour the frog brought to Juan the handkerchief, all  beautifully embroidered. When Juan arrived at home, he found his  brothers there, each with his handkerchief beautifully embroidered,  but Juan's handkerchief was embroidered the most beautifully of all.    Then their father said: \"Your wives, evidently, can embroider well,  but I must see how they can cook. Here are three cows. Each of you  must take one of them and have your wife cook it.\" The brothers went  off with the cows, but Juan led his cow to the well in which the frog  lived, and, as before, sat down and began to weep. After a while the  frog came to the top of the water and asked: \"Why are you weeping so  bitterly?\" \"Oh, my dear frog! Here is a cow which my father says my  wife must cook. What shall I do?\" The frog replied: \"Go to sleep for  an hour and I will cook the meat for you.\" Juan went to sleep, and at  the end of the hour the frog woke him, and showing him the cow cooked  whole, said: \"Take this home and when you have carried it upstairs,  break off one horn and see what will happen.\" Juan took the roast cow  home, and when he arrived there found his brothers before him, with  their meat roasted. Juan carried his cow upstairs and each animal  was placed upon a table by itself. The king tasted Pedro's meat,  and found it too salt. Then he tried Pablo's, and found it not salt  enough. When he approached the table on which Juan's meat was laid,  Juan broke off one of the cow's horns, and immediately a beautiful  service of silver dishes, enough for twelve persons, rolled out, each  dish taking its proper place upon the table, with the roast cow in  the midst. Then the king and his councillors sat down to the feast,  and when they had tasted the meat, they found it just right.    On the next day the king ordered his sons to bring their wives to the  palace, so that he might decide which was the most beautiful. Juan was  in more trouble than ever, for now he was sure of being discovered;  so he went to the well again, weeping bitterly and calling aloud  for the frog. In a few minutes the frog appeared, and to him Juan  related his trouble. The frog said: \"Under that tree is a hammock; go  to sleep in it for an hour, and three women will wake you by shaking  the hammock. Take the middle one and return home, for that one is to  be your wife.\" All happened as the frog had said. Juan took the woman  home with him, and as he approached the house, his father was looking  out of the window. When the king saw how beautiful Juan's wife was,  he was so overcome with joy that he fainted. When he had recovered,  he declared Juan's wife was the most beautiful woman he had ever  seen. So to Juan was given the kingdom. Pedro became the palace  coachman, and Pablo the cook.    Berton L. Maxfield, Ph. B.    Brooklyn, N. Y.      CHAPTER 11    The Datto Somacuel.        Datto Somacuel was one of the seven chiefs who, coming from Borneo  many years before the Spaniards conquered these islands, settled the  Island of Panay. He lived in Sinaragan, a town near San Joaquin, in  the southern part of Iloilo Province. His wife's name was Capinangan.    Somacuel went every morning to the seashore to watch his slaves  fish with the sinchoro, or net. One day they caught many fishes,  and Somacuel commanded them:--    \"Spread the fish to dry, and take care that the crows do not eat  them up.\"    A slave answered: \"Sir, if your treasure inside the house is stolen by  the crows, how do you expect those out of doors to be kept safe?\" This  was said with a certain intonation that made Somacuel conjecture that  there was a hidden meaning in it.    \"What do you mean by that?\" he asked.    \"Sir, I have to inform you of something that I should have told you  long ago. Do not reprove me if I have been backward in telling you  of the injury done you by your wife. It was due to my desire to get  complete proofs of the truth of my statement.\"    \"End at once your tedious narrative!\" said the datto, \"What did my  wife do?\"    \"Sir,\" answered the slave, \"she deceives you shamefully. She loves  Gorong-Gorong, who is at this very moment in your house jesting at  your absence.\"    \"Alas!\" said Somacuel, \"if this be true he shall pay well for his  boldness.\"    The chief hurried home, intending to surprise the offenders. He carried  a fish called ampahan in a bamboo tube full of water, going around by  a secret way, so as not to be seen. On reaching home he went up into  the attic to observe what was going on, and found that his informant  had told the truth.    Gorong-Gorong and Capinangan were engaged in an affectionate  dialogue. Involuntarily Somacuel spilled some of the water down, and,  fearing that he would be discovered, seized a spear that was hidden  in the attic and, dropping it down, dexterously ran Gorong-Gorong  through the body, killing him instantly.    \"Oh, Diva!\" exclaimed Capinangan, kneeling beside the inert corpse,  \"How shall I be able to take it away without being discovered by  Somacuel?\"    Somacuel, who had not been seen at all, stayed quietly above, watching  what Capinangan would do. Capinangan did not suspect that her husband  was there, as he usually did not come home before nightfall. She  tried to take the corpse out for burial, but could not carry the heavy  body of her unfortunate lover. She must conceal it in some way, and  it was dangerous for her to call for aid, lest she might be betrayed  to her husband. So she took a knife and cut the body into pieces so  that she could take them out and bury them under the house.    After this task was done she managed to wash the blood up. She  became tranquil for a moment, believing she would never be  discovered. Somacuel, however, had observed all, and he formed a  plan for punishing his wife as she deserved. When everything seemed  to be calm he crept down, doing his best not to be seen. At the door  he called his wife by name. Capinangan was afraid, but concealed her  fear with a smile. \"Capinangan,\" said her husband, \"cut this fish in  pieces and cook it for me.\"    Capinangan was astonished at this command, because she had never before  been treated in this way. They had many slaves to perform such tasks.    \"You know I cannot,\" she said.    \"Why not?\" asked her husband.    \"Because I have never learned how to cut a fish in pieces nor to cook  it,\" she replied.    \"I am astonished that you don't know how to cut, after seeing that  cutting is your favorite occupation,\" said Somacuel.    Capinangan then did not doubt that her husband knew what she had done,  so she did as he had bidden.    When dinner was ready the husband and wife ate it, but without speaking  to each other. After the meal, Somacuel told his wife that he had  seen all and should punish her severely. Capinangan said nothing. A  guilty person has no argument with which to defend himself.

Far  above it were the heavens, peopled by supernatural beings. At a certain  time one of these, a woman, by name Ataensic, threw herself through a rift  in the sky and fell toward the earth. What led her to this act was  variously recorded. Some said that it was to recover her dog which had  fallen through while chasing a bear. Others related that those who dwelt  in the world above lived off the fruit of a certain tree; that the husband  of Ataensic, being sick, dreamed that to restore him this tree must be cut  down; and that when Ataensic dealt it a blow with her stone axe, the tree  suddenly sank through the floor of the sky, and she precipitated herself  after it.    However the event occurred, she fell from heaven down to the primeval  waters. There a turtle offered her his broad back as a resting-place  until, from a little mud which was brought her, either by a frog, a beaver  or some other animal, she, by magic power, formed dry land on which to  reside.    At the time she fell from the sky she was pregnant, and in due time was  delivered of a daughter, whose name, unfortunately, the legend does not  record. This daughter grew to womanhood and conceived without having seen  a man, for none was as yet created. The product of her womb was twins, and  even before birth one of them betrayed his restless and evil nature, by  refusing to be born in the usual manner, but insisting on breaking through  his parent's side (or armpit). He did so, but it cost his mother her life.  Her body was buried, and from it sprang the various vegetable productions  which the new earth required to fit it for the habitation of man. From her  head grew the pumpkin vine; from her breast, the maize; from her limbs,  the bean and other useful esculents.    Meanwhile the two brothers grew up. The one was named Ioskeha. He went  about the earth, which at that time was arid and waterless, and called  forth the springs and lakes, and formed the sparkling brooks and broad  rivers. But his brother, the troublesome Tawiscara, he whose obstinacy had  caused their mother's death, created an immense frog which swallowed all  the water and left the earth as dry as before. Ioskeha was informed of  this by the partridge, and immediately set out for his brother's country,  for they had divided the earth between them.    Soon he came to the gigantic frog, and piercing it in the side (or  armpit), the waters flowed out once more in their accustomed ways. Then it  was revealed to Ioskeha by his mother's spirit that Tawiscara intended to  slay him by treachery. Therefore, when the brothers met, as they soon did,  it was evident that a mortal combat was to begin.    Now, they were not men, but gods, whom it was impossible really to kill,  nor even could either be seemingly slain, except by one particular  substance, a secret which each had in his own keeping. As therefore a  contest with ordinary weapons would have been vain and unavailing, they  agreed to tell each other what to each was the fatal implement of war.  Ioskeha acknowledged that to him a branch of the wild rose (or, according  to another version, a bag filled with maize) was more dangerous than  anything else; and Tawiscara disclosed that the horn of a deer could alone  reach his vital part.    They laid off the lists, and Tawiscara, having the first chance, attacked  his brother violently with a branch of the wild rose, and beat him till he  lay as one dead; but quickly reviving, Ioskeha assaulted Tawiscara with  the antler of a deer, and dealing him a blow in the side, the blood flowed  from the wound in streams. The unlucky combatant fled from the field,  hastening toward the west, and as he ran the drops of his blood which fell  upon the earth turned into flint stones. Ioskeha did not spare him, but  hastening after, finally slew him. He did not, however, actually kill him,  for, as I have said, these were beings who could not die; and, in fact,  Tawiscara was merely driven from the earth and forced to reside in the far  west, where he became ruler of the spirits of the dead. These go there to  dwell when they leave the bodies behind them here.    Ioskeha, returning, peaceably devoted himself to peopling the land. He  opened a cave which existed in the earth and allowed to come forth from it  all the varieties of animals with which the woods and prairies are  peopled. In order that they might be more easily caught by men, he wounded  every one in the foot except the wolf, which dodged his blow; for that  reason this beast is one of the most difficult to catch. He then formed  men and gave them life, and instructed them in the art of making fire,  which he himself had learned from the great tortoise. Furthermore he  taught them how to raise maize, and it is, in fact, Ioskeha himself who  imparts fertility to the soil, and through his bounty and kindness the  grain returns a hundred fold.    Nor did they suppose that he was a distant, invisible, unapproachable god.  No, he was ever at hand with instruction and assistance. Was there to be a  failure in the harvest, he would be seen early in the season, thin with  anxiety about his people, holding in his hand a blighted ear of corn. Did  a hunter go out after game, he asked the aid of Ioskeha, who would put fat  animals in the way, were he so minded. At their village festivals he was  present and partook of the cheer.    Once, in 1640, when the smallpox was desolating the villages of the  Hurons, we are told by Father Lalemant that an Indian said there had  appeared to him a beautiful youth, of imposing stature, and addressed him  with these words: \"Have no fear; I am the master of the earth, whom you  Hurons adore under the name _Ioskeha_. The French wrongly call me Jesus,  because they do not know me. It grieves me to see the pestilence that is  destroying my people, and I come to teach you its cause and its remedy.  Its cause is the presence of these strangers; and its remedy is to drive  out these black robes (the missionaries), to drink of a certain water  which I shall tell you of, and to hold a festival in my honor, which must  be kept up all night, until the dawn of day.\"    The home of Ioskeha is in the far East, at that part of the horizon where  the sun rises. There he has his cabin, and there he dwells with his  grandmother, the wise Ataensic. She is a woman of marvelous magical power,  and is capable of assuming any shape she pleases. In her hands is the fate  of all men's lives, and while Ioskeha looks after the things of life, it  is she who appoints the time of death, and concerns herself with all that  relates to the close of existence. Hence she was feared, not exactly as a  maleficent deity, but as one whose business is with what is most dreaded  and gloomy.    It was said that on a certain occasion four bold young men determined to  journey to the sun-rising and visit the great Ioskeha. They reached his  cabin and found him there alone. He received them affably and they  conversed pleasantly, but at a certain moment he bade them hide themselves  for their life, as his grandmother was coming. They hastily concealed  themselves, and immediately Ataensic entered. Her magic insight had warned  her of the presence of guests, and she had assumed the form of a beautiful  girl, dressed in gay raiment, her neck and arms resplendent with collars  and bracelets of wampum. She inquired for the guests, but Ioskeha, anxious  to save them, dissembled, and replied that he knew not what she meant. She  went forth to search for them, when he called them forth from their hiding  place and bade them flee, and thus they escaped.    It was said of Ioskeha that he acted the part of husband to his  grandmother. In other words, the myth presents the germ of that conception  which the priests of ancient Egypt endeavored to express when they taught  that Osiris was \"his own father and his own son,\" that he was the  \"self-generating one,\" even that he was \"the father of his own mother.\"  These are grossly materialistic expressions, but they are perfectly clear  to the student of mythology. They are meant to convey to the mind the  self-renewing power of life in nature, which is exemplified in the sowing  and the seeding, the winter and the summer, the dry and the rainy seasons,  and especially the sunset and sunrise. They are echoes in the soul of man  of the ceaseless rhythm in the operations of nature, and they become the  only guarantors of his hopes for immortal life.[1]    [Footnote 1: Such epithets were common, in the Egyptian religion, to most  of the gods of fertility. Amun, called in some of the inscriptions \"the  soul of Osiris,\" derives his name from the root _men_, to impregnate, to  beget. In the Karnak inscriptions he is also termed \"the husband of his  mother.\" This, too, was the favorite appellation of Chem, who was a form  of Horos. See Dr. C.P. Tiele, _History of the Egyptian Religion_, pp. 124,  146. 149, 150, etc.]    Let us look at the names in the myth before us, for confirmation of this.  _Ioskeha_ is in the Oneida dialect of the Iroquois an impersonal verbal  form of the third person singular, and means "]]]
