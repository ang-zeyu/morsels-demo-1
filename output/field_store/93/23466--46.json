But hate cannot come up to love for keen watchfulness at every  turn. Health, strength, home, loved ones, friendships, money, guidance,  protecting care, the necessities, the extras that love ever thinks of,  service--all these are included in God's loving thought for us. That is  His will. It is modified by the degree of our consent, and further  modified by the circumstances of our lives. Life has become a badly  tangled skein of threads. God with infinite patience and skill is at work  untangling and bringing the best possible out of the tangle. What is  absolutely best is rarely relatively best. That which is best in itself is  usually not best under certain circumstances, with human lives in the  balance. God has fathomless skill, and measureless patience, and a love  utterly beyond both. He is ever working out the best thing possible under  every circumstance. He could oftentimes do more, and do it in much less  time if our human wills were more pliant to His. He can be trusted. And of  course _trust_ means _trust in the darkest dark_ where you cannot see. And  trust means trust. It does not mean test. Where you trust you do not test.  Where you test you do not trust. Making this our prayer means trusting  God. That is God, and that His will, and that the meaning of our offering  this prayer. \"Thy will _be_.\" A man's will is the man in action, within  the limits of his power. God's will for man is Himself in action, within  the limits of our cooperation. _Be_ is a verb, an action-word, in the  passive voice. It takes some form of the verb to be to express the  passive voice of any action-word. It takes the intensest activity of will  to put this passive voice into human action. The greatest strength is  revealed in intelligent yielding. Here the prayer is expressing the utter  willingness of a man that God's will shall be done in him, and through  him. A man never _loses_ his will, unless indeed he lose his manhood. But  here he makes that will as strong as it can be made, as a bit of steel,  better like the strong oak, strong enough to sway and bend in the wind.  Then he uses all its strength in becoming passive to a higher will. And  that too when the purpose of that higher will is not clear to his own  limited knowledge and understanding.    \"Thy will be _done_.\" That is, be accomplished, be brought to pass. The  word stands for the action in its perfected, finished state. Thy will be  fully accomplished in its whole sweep and in all its items. It speaks not  only the earnest desire of the heart praying, but the set purpose that  everything in the life is held subject to the doing of this purpose of  God. It means that surrender of purpose that has utterly changed the lives  of the strongest men in order that the purpose of God might be dominant.  It cut off from a great throne earth's greatest jurist, the Hebrew  lawgiver, and led him instead to be allied to a race of slaves. It led  that intellectual giant Jeremiah from an easy enjoyable leadership to  espouse a despised cause and so be himself despised. It led Paul from the  leadership of his generation in a great nation to untold suffering, and to  a block and an ax. It led Jesus the very Son of God, away from a kingship  to a cross. In every generation it has radically changed lives, and  life-ambitions. \"Thy will be done\" is the great dominant purpose-prayer  that has been the pathway of God in all His great doings among men.    That will is being done everywhere else in God's great world of worlds,  save on the earth and that portion of the spirit world allied to this  earth. Everywhere else there is the perfect music of harmony with God's  will. Here only is heard the harsh discordant note.    With this prayer go two clauses that really particularize and explain it.  They are included in it, and are added to make more clear the full intent.  The first of these clauses gives the sweep of His will in its broadest  outlines. The second touches the opposition to that will both for our  individual lives and for the race and the earth.    The first clause is this, \"Thy kingdom come.\" In both of these short  sentences, \"Thy will be done,\" \"Thy kingdom come,\" the emphatic word is  \"Thy.\" That word is set in sharpest possible contrast here. There is  another kingdom now on the earth. There is another will being done. This  other kingdom must go if God's kingdom is to come. These kingdoms are  antagonistic at every point of contact. They are rivals for the same  allegiance and the same territory. They cannot exist together. Charles II  and Cromwell cannot remain in London together. \"Thy kingdom come,\" of  necessity includes this, \"the other kingdom go.\" \"Thy kingdom come\" means  likewise \"Thy king come,\" for in the nature of things there cannot be a  kingdom without a king. That means again by the same inference, \"the other  prince go,\" the one who makes pretensions to being rightful heir to the  throne. \"Thy will be done\" includes by the same inference this:--\"the  other will be undone.\" This is the first great explanatory clause to be  connected with this greatest prayer, \"Thy kingdom come.\" It gives the  sweep of God's will in its broadest outlines.    The second clause included in the prayer, and added to make clear the  swing of action is this--\"deliver us from the evil one.\" These two  sentences, \"Thy will be done,\" and \"deliver us from the evil one,\" are  naturally connected. Each statement includes the other. To have God's will  fully done in us means emancipation from every influence of the evil one,  either direct or indirect, or by hereditary taint. To be delivered from  the evil one means that every thought and plan of God for our lives shall  be fully carried out.    There are the two great wills at work in the world ever clashing in the  action of history and in our individual lives. In many of us, aye, in all  of us, though in greatly varying degree, these two wills constantly clash.  Man is the real battle-field. The pitch of the battle is in his will. God  will not do His will in a man without the man's will consenting. And Satan  cannot. At the root the one thing that works against God's will is the  evil one's will. And on the other hand the one thing that effectively  thwarts Satan's plans is a man wholly given up to God's will.    The greatest prayer then fully expressed, sweeps first the whole field of  action, then touches the heart of the action, and then attacks the  opposition. It is this:--Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done: deliver us  from the evil one. Every true prayer ever offered comes under this simple  comprehensive prayer. It may be offered, it _is_ offered with an infinite  variety of detail. It is greatest because of its sweep. It includes all  other petitions, for God's will includes everything for which prayer is  rightly offered. It is greatest in its intensity. It hits the very  bull's-eye of opposition to God.          II. Hindrances to Prayer      1. Why the Results Fail. 2. Why the Results Are Delayed. 3. The Great  Outside Hindrance, or, the Relation of Prayer to Satan.          Why the Results Fail        <u>Breaking with God.</u>      God answers prayer. Prayer is God and man joining hands to secure some  high end. He joins with us through the communication of prayer in  accomplishing certain great results. This is the main drive of prayer. Our  asking and expecting and God's doing jointly bring to pass things that  otherwise would not come to pass. Prayer changes things. This is the great  fact of prayer.    Yet a great many prayers are not answered. Or, to put it more accurately,  a great many prayers fail utterly of accomplishing any results. Probably  it is accurate to say that _thousands_ of prayers go up and bring nothing  down. This is certainly true. Let us say it just as bluntly and plainly as  it can be said. As a result many persons are saying: \"Well, prayer is not  what you claim for it: we prayed and no answer came: nothing was changed.\"    From all sorts of circles, and in all sorts of language comes this  statement. Scholarly men who write with wisdom's words, and thoughtless  people whose thinking never even pricks the skin of the subject, and all  sorts of people in between group themselves together here. And they are  right, quite right. The bother is that what they say is not all there is  to be said. There is yet more to be said, that is right too, and that  changes the final conclusion radically. Partial truth is a very mean sort  of lie.    The prayer plan like many another has been much disturbed, and often  broken. And one who would be a partner with God up to the limit of his  power must understand the things that hinder the prayer plan. There are  three sorts of hindrances to prayer. First of all there are things in us  that _break off connection_ with God, the source of the changing power.  Then there are certain things in us that _delay, or diminish_ the results;  that interfere with the full swing of the prayer plan of operations. And  then there is a great _outside_ hindrance to be reckoned upon. To-day we  want to talk together of the first of these, namely, the hindrances that  _break off connections_ between God and His human partner.    Here again there is a division into three. There are three things directly  spoken of in the book of God that hinder prayer. One of these is a  familiar thing. What a pity that repugnant things may become so familiar  as no longer to repel. It is this:--_sin_ hinders prayer. In Isaiah's  first chapter God Himself speaking says, \"When you stretch out your  hands\"--the way they prayed, standing with outstretched hands--\"I will  shut My eyes; when you make many prayers, I will shut My ears.\"[12] Why?  What's the difficulty? These outstretched hands are _soiled!_ They are  actually holding their sin-soiled hands up into God's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#8)"],[1,"and have his head shaved smooth and slick as  a peeled onion, and then stripped to the naked skin.  Then a strapping  fellow with a big rawhide would make the blood flow and spurt at every  lick, the wretch begging and howling like a hound, and then he was  branded with a red hot iron with the letter D on both hips, when he was  marched through the army to the music of the \"Rogue's March.\"  It was  enough.  None of General Bragg's soldiers ever loved him.  They had no  faith in his ability as a general.  He was looked upon as a merciless  tyrant.  The soldiers were very scantily fed.  Bragg never was a good  feeder or commissary-general.  Rations with us were always scarce.  No extra rations were ever allowed to the negroes who were with us as  servants.  No coffee or whisky or tobacco were ever allowed to be issued  to the troops.  If they obtained these luxuries, they were not from the  government.  These luxuries were withheld in order to crush the very  heart and spirit of his troops.  We were crushed.  Bragg was the great  autocrat.  In the mind of the soldier, his word was law.  He loved to  crush the spirit of his men.  The more of a hang-dog look they had about  them the better was General Bragg pleased.  Not a single soldier in the  whole army ever loved or respected him.  But he is dead now.    Peace to his ashes!    We became starved skeletons; naked and ragged rebels.  The chronic  diarrhoea became the scourge of the army.  Corinth became one vast  hospital.  Almost the whole army attended the sick call every morning.  All the water courses went dry, and we used water out of filthy pools.    Halleck was advancing; we had to fortify Corinth.  A vast army, Grant,  Buell, Halleck, Sherman, all were advancing on Corinth.  Our troops  were in no condition to fight.  In fact, they had seen enough of this  miserable yet tragic farce.  They were ready to ring down the curtain,  put out the footlights and go home.  They loved the Union anyhow, and  were always opposed to this war.  But breathe softly the name of Bragg.  It had more terror than the advancing hosts of Halleck's army.  The shot  and shell would come tearing through our ranks.  Every now and then a  soldier was killed or wounded, and we thought what \"magnificent\" folly.  Death was welcome.  Halleck's whole army of blue coats had no terror now.  When we were drawn up in line of battle, a detail of one-tenth of the  army was placed in our rear to shoot us down if we ran.  No pack of  hounds under the master's lash, or body of penitentiary convicts were  ever under greater surveillance.  We were tenfold worse than slaves;  our morale was a thing of the past; the glory of war and the pride of  manhood had been sacrificed upon Bragg's tyrannical holocaust.  But  enough of this.      ROWLAND SHOT TO DEATH    One morning I went over to the 23rd Tennessee Regiment on a visit to  Captain Gray Armstrong and Colonel Jim Niel, both of whom were glad to  see me, as we were old ante-bellum friends.  While at Colonel Niel's  marquee I saw a detail of soldiers bring out a man by the name of Rowland,  whom they were going to shoot to death with musketry, by order of a  court-martial, for desertion.  I learned that he had served out the term  for which he had originally volunteered, had quit our army and joined  that of the Yankees, and was captured with Prentiss' Yankee brigade  at Shiloh.  He was being hauled to the place of execution in a wagon,  sitting on an old gun box, which was to be his coffin.  When they got to  the grave, which had been dug the day before, the water had risen in it,  and a soldier was baling it out.  Rowland spoke up and said, \"Please hand  me a drink of that water, as I want to drink out of my own grave so the  boys will talk about it when I am dead, and remember Rowland.\"  They  handed him the water and he drank all there was in the bucket, and  handing it back asked them to please hand him a little more, as he had  heard that water was very scarce in hell, and it would be the last he  would ever drink.  He was then carried to the death post, and there he  began to cut up jack generally.  He began to curse Bragg, Jeff. Davis,  and the Southern Confederacy, and all the rebels at a terrible rate.  He was simply arrogant and very insulting.  I felt that he deserved  to die.  He said he would show the rebels how a Union man could die.  I do not know what all he did say.  When the shooting detail came up,  he went of his own accord and knelt down at the post.  The Captain  commanding the squad gave the command, \"Ready, aim, fire!\" and Rowland  tumbled over on his side.  It was the last of Rowland.      KILLING A YANKEE SHARPSHOOTER    In our immediate front, at Corinth, Mississippi, our men were being  picked off by sharpshooters, and a great many were killed, but no one  could tell where the shots came from.  At one particular post it was  sure death.  Every detail that had been sent to this post for a week had  been killed.  In distributing the detail this post fell to Tom Webb and  myself.  They were bringing off a dead boy just as we went on duty.  Colonel George C. Porter, of the 6th Tennessee, warned us to keep a good  lookout.  We took our stands.  A minnie ball whistled right by my head.  I don't think it missed me an eighth of an inch.  Tom had sat down on an  old chunk of wood, and just as he took his seat, zip! a ball took the  chunk of wood.  Tom picked it up and began laughing at our tight place.  Happening to glance up towards the tree tops, I saw a smoke rising above  a tree, and about the same time I saw a Yankee peep from behind the tree,  up among the bushes.  I quickly called Tom's attention to it, and pointed  out the place.  We could see his ramrod as he handled it while loading  his gun; saw him raise his gun, as we thought, to put a cap on it.  Tom in the meantime had lain flat on his belly and placed his gun across  the chunk he had been sitting on.  I had taken a rest for my gun by the  side of a sapling, and both of us had dead aim at the place where the  Yankee was.  Finally we saw him sort o' peep round the tree, and we moved  about a little so that he might see us, and as we did so, the Yankee  stepped out in full view, and bang, bang!  Tom and I had both shot.  We saw that Yankee tumble out like a squirrel.  It sounded like distant  thunder when that Yankee struck the ground.  We heard the Yankees carry  him off.  One thing I am certain of, and that is, not another Yankee went  up that tree that day, and Colonel George C. Porter complimented Tom and  I very highly on our success.  This is where I first saw a jack o'lantern  (ignis fatui).  That night, while Tom and I were on our posts, we saw a  number of very dim lights, which seemed to be in motion.  At first we  took them to be Yankees moving about with lights.  Whenever we could get  a shot we would blaze away.  At last one got up very close, and passed  right between Tom and I.  I don't think I was ever more scared in my  life.  My hair stood on end like the quills of the fretful porcupine;  I could not imagine what on earth it was.  I took it to be some hellish  machination of a Yankee trick.  I did not know whether to run or stand,  until I heard Tom laugh and say, \"Well, well, that's a jack o'lantern.\"      COLONEL FIELD    Before proceeding further with these memoirs, I desire to give short  sketches of two personages with whom we were identified and closely  associated until the winding up of the ball.  The first is Colonel  Hume R. Field.  Colonel Field was born a soldier.  I have read many  descriptions of Stonewall Jackson.  Colonel Field was his exact  counterpart.  They looked somewhat alike, spoke alike, and alike were  trained military soldiers.  The War Department at Richmond made a  grand mistake in not making him a \"commander of armies.\"  He was not  a brilliant man; could not talk at all.  He was a soldier.  His  conversation was yea and nay.  But when you could get \"yes, sir,\" and \"no,  sir,\" out of him his voice was as soft and gentle as a maid's when she  says \"yes\" to her lover.  Fancy, if you please, a man about thirty years  old, a dark skin, made swarthy by exposure to sun and rain, very black  eyes that seemed to blaze with a gentle luster.  I never saw him the  least excited in my life.  His face was a face of bronze.  His form was  somewhat slender, but when you looked at him you saw at the first glance  that this would be a dangerous man in a ground skuffle, a foot race,  or a fight.  There was nothing repulsive or forbidding or even  domineering in his looks.  A child or a dog would make up with him on  first sight.  He knew not what fear was, or the meaning of the word fear.  He had no nerves, or rather, has a rock or tree any nerves?  You might as  well try to shake the nerves of a rock or tree as those of Colonel Field.  He was the bravest man, I think, I ever knew.  Later in the war he was  known by every soldier in the army; and the First Tennessee Regiment,  by his manipulations, became the regiment to occupy \"tight places.\"  He knew his men.  When he struck the Yankee line they felt the blow.  He had, himself, set the example, and so trained his regiment that all  the armies in the world could not whip it.  They might kill every man in  it, is true, but they would die game to the last man.  His men all loved  him.  He was no disciplinarian, but made his regiment what it was by his  own example.  And every day on the march you would see some poor old  ragged rebel riding his fine gray mare, and he was walking.      CAPTAIN JOE P. LEE    The other person I wish to speak of is Captain Joe P. Lee.  Captain Henry  J. Webster was our regular captain, but was captured while on furlough,  sent to a northern prison and died there, and Joe went up by promotion.  He was quite a young man, about twenty-one years old, but as brave as  any old Roman soldier that ever lived.  Joe's face was ever wreathed in  smiles, and from the "]]]
