My regards to Madame Lapierre and your son. I am cordially yours,      squeezing your hand.        PEDRO S. DE MORENO.    But the Lapierres and Tessiers, while not for an instant distrusting the  honesty of the General, had become extremely weary of sending him  money. Each heir felt that he had contributed enough toward the  General's \"expenses and invitations.\" Even the one hundred and fifty  millions within easy reach did not prompt immediate response.    About the same time an extraordinary messenger arrived at the Lapierre  farm, purporting to come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and  instructing Lapierre to repair immediately to Paris. The messenger  explained that the presence of Lapierre was desired at the Ministry in  connection with some investigation then in progress into the affairs of  one Jean Tessier. Then the messenger departed as mysteriously as he had  arrived.    Good M. Lapierre was highly excited. Here was indubitable evidence of  the truth of the General's assertions. But, just as the latter had  intended, perhaps, the worthy farmer jumped to the conclusion that  probably the messenger from Paris had been sent by the conspirators.    \"At the last moment,\" wrote Lapierre to Moreno, \"I received from Paris a  letter commanding me to go to the Ministry, and at the same time a  telegram recommending that I leave at once. I shall write you from Paris  all that I learn to your interest. If this letter should not reach you  sealed in red wax, with small indentations made with a sewing thimble  and my initials, which I always sign, it is that our correspondence is  seized and read.\"    Events followed in rapid succession. Lapierre, the Tessiers, including  the little blacksmith, became almost hysterical with excitement. A  gentleman, by name \"Mr. Francis Delas,\" called upon Lapierre and offered  him twenty-five million dollars spot cash for his wife's share in the  Tessier inheritance. This person also claimed that he had a power of  attorney from all the other heirs, with the exception of Pettit and  Rozier, and asserted that he was on the point of embarking for New York  in their interest. He urged Lapierre to substitute him for Moreno. But  Lapierre, now convinced that everything was as the General had claimed  it to be, indignantly rejected any such proposition aimed at his old  friend, and sent Mr. Francis Delas packing about his business.        \"This is what my answer has been to him: 'Sir, we have already an      agent with whom we can only have cause to be satisfied, so that your      services are not acceptable or needed.' He left me most dissatisfied      and scolding.\"    The sending of this confederate on the part of the wily General had  precisely the effect hoped for. Lapierre and his friends were now  convinced that the inheritance Tessier was a reality, and that powerful  personages were not only exerting their influence to prevent the  rightful heirs from obtaining their property, but had also in some way  secured the cooperation of government officials. It was agreed, on all  hands, that the worthy landowner, accompanied by Madame Reddon, had  better proceed at once to the scene of operations and unite with the  General in their common purpose. Once on the ground Lapierre could  assume direction of his own campaign.    Lapierre and Madame Reddon accordingly sailed for America and arrived in  New York on the fourth of December, 1904, where they were met on the  dock by the General, who, freshly barbered, and with a rose in his  buttonhole, invited them, as soon as they had recovered from the fatigue  of landing, to make a personal inspection of their properties.    These heirs to hundreds of millions of dollars were conducted by the  \"Marquis de la d'Essa and Count de Tinoco\" to the Battery, where he  gallantly seated them in an electric surface car, and proceeded to show  them the inheritance. He pointed out successively Number 100 Broadway,  the \"Flatiron\" Building, the Fifth Avenue Hotel and the Holland House,  the Waldorf-Astoria, the Vanderbilt mansion at Fifty-seventh Street and  Fifth Avenue, the Hotel Savoy and the Hotel Netherland, incidentally  taking a cross-town trip to the ferry station at East Twenty-third  Street, and to Bellevue Hospital. A public omnibus conveyed them around  Central Park--also their own. And, in spite of the cold weather, the  General insisted on showing them the \"Tessier mansion and estate at Fort  George\"--visible from the Washington Bridge--\"a beautiful property in  the centre of a wood.\" Returning, he took them to the Museum of Natural  History and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contained  \"Tessier's collections.\"    Having thus given them a bird's-eye view of the promised land, the  General escorted them to his apartments and allowed them to see the Ark  of the Covenant in the shape of a somewhat dilapidated leather trunk,  which contained a paper alleged to be the will of Jean Tessier, made in  Bellevue Hospital (one of his possessions), and unlawfully seized by the  Lespinasse family. It was only, Moreno alleged, through the powerful  influence of the Jesuits that he had been able to secure and keep a copy  of this will.    Although the Marquis de la d'Essa must have known that his days were  numbered, he was as gay and as entertaining as ever. Then, suddenly, the  scales began to fall from Madame Reddon's eyes. The promised meeting  with Marie Louise Lespinasse and her mysterious representative, \"Mr.  Benedict-Smith,\" was constantly adjourned; the \"police agents,\" whom it  had been so necessary to entertain and invite to saloons and cafes, were  strangely absent, and so were the counsellors, Jesuit Fathers, bankers,  and others who had crowded the General's antechambers. A slatternly  Hibernian woman appeared, claiming the hero as her husband; his landlady  caused him to be evicted from her premises; and his trunk containing the  famous \"_dossier_\" was thrown into the street, where it lay until the  General himself, placing it upon his princely shoulders, bore it to a  fifteen-cent lodging-house.    \"And now, M'sieu',\" said little Madame Reddon, raising her hands and  clasping them entreatingly before her, \"we have come to seek vengeance  upon this _miserable_! This _villain m'sieu_! He has taken our money and  made fools of us. Surely you will give us justice!\"    \"Yes,\" echoed Lapierre stubbornly, \"and the money was my own money,  which I had made from the products of my farming.\"    A month later Don Pedro Suarez de Moreno, Count de Tinoco, Marquis de la  d'Essa, and Brigadier-General of the Royal Armies of the Philippines and  of Spain, sat at the bar of the General Sessions, twirling his mustache  and uttering loud snorts of contempt while Lapierre and Madame Reddon  told their story to an almost incredulous yet sympathetic jury.    But the real trial began only when he arose to take the witness chair in  his own behalf. Apparently racked with pain, and laboring under the most  frightful physical infirmities, the General, through an interpreter,  introduced himself to the jury by all his titles, asserting that he had  inherited his patents of nobility from the \"Prince of Arras,\" from whom  he was descended, and that he was in very truth \"General-in-Chief of the  Armies of the King of Spain, General Secretary of War, and Custodian of  the Royal Seal.\" He admitted telling the Lapierres that they were the  heirs of five hundred million dollars, but he had himself honestly  believed it. When he and the rest of them had discovered their common  error they had turned upon him and were now hounding him out of revenge.  The courtly General was as _distingue_ as ever as he addressed the  hard-headed jury of tradesmen before him. As what _canaille_ he must  have regarded them! What a position for the \"Count de Tinoco\"!    Then two officers entered the courtroom bearing the famous trunk of the  General between them. The top tray proved to contain thousands of  railroad tickets. The prosecutor requested the defendant to explain  their possession.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Moreno, twirling his mustaches, \"when I was General  under my King Don Carlos, in the Seven Years' War of '75 and also in  Catalonia in '80, I issued these tickets to wounded soldiers for their  return home. At the boundaries the Spanish tickets were exchanged for  French tickets.\" He looked as if he really meant it.    Then the prosecutor called his attention to the fact that most of them  bore the date of 1891 and were printed in French--not in Spanish. The  prisoner seemed greatly surprised and muttered under his breath vaguely  about \"plots\" and \"conspiracies.\" Then he suddenly remembered that the  tickets were a \"collection,\" made by his little son.    Beneath the tickets were found sheaves of blank orders of nobility and  blank commissions in the army of Spain, bearing what appeared to be the  royal seal. These the General asserted that he had the right to confer,  by proxy, for his \"King Don Carlos.\" Hundreds of other documents bearing  various arms and crests lay interspersed among them. The prisoner drew  himself up magnificently.    \"I was the General Secretary of War of my King,\" said he. \"When I had to  give orders to the generals under me, of whom I was the chief, I had the  right to put thereon the royal imprint of Don Carlos. I was given all  the papers incident to the granting of orders and grades in the army,  and I had the seal of the King--the seal of the Royal King.\"    But, unfortunately for the prisoner, the seals upon the papers turned  out to be the legitimate arms of Spain and not those of Don Carlos, and  as a finale he ingenuously identified the seal of the Mayor of Madrid as  that of his \"Royal King.\"    Next came a selection of letters of nobility, sealed and signed in the  name of Pope Leo the Thirteenth. These, he asserted, must have been  placed there by his enemies. \"I am a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#8)"],[1,"milk, one-quarter  teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of cinnamon extract  (Burnett's), two cups of flour, one-quarter cup of Baker's Breakfast  Cocoa, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.
