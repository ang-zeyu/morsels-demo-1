There were twenty of them in Pompeii. You will  see the ovens in the courtyard. They are big beehives built of stone or  brick. The baker made a fire inside and let the walls become hot. Then  he raked out the coals and cleaned the floor and put in his bread. The  hot walls baked the loaves. In one oven the excavators found a burned  loaf eighteen hundred years old. When the earthquake shook his house,  did the baker snatch out the rest of the ovenful to feed his hungry  family as they groped about for safety in the terrible darkness?  In several bakeries you will see, also, the mills. They are great  mortar-shaped things standing taller than a man. The heavy stone above  turned around upon the stone below. A man poured wheat in at the top. It  fell down and was ground between the two stones and dropped out at the  bottom as flour. A horse or donkey was hitched to the mill to turn it.  Around and around he walked all day. He was blindfolded to prevent his  becoming dizzy. You will see on the stone floor in one bakery the path  that was made by years of this walking. In the old days this silent  empty court must have been an interesting place. The donkey's hoofs beat  lazy time on the stone floor. Now and then a slave lifted up a bag of  wheat and poured it into the mill or scooped out the white flour from  the trough at the bottom. Another man sifted the flour and the breeze  blew the white dust over his bare arms. Some of the ovens were smoking  and glowing with fresh fire. Others were shut, with the browning bread  inside, and a good smell hung in the air. And out in front was a little  shop where the master sold the thin loaves and the fancy little cakes.    In the hundreds of houses and shops of this little town the excavators  have found bronze tables and lamps and lamp stands and wine jars and  kitchen pots and pans and spoons and glass vases and silver cups and  gold hairpins and jewelry and ivory combs and bronze strigils and  mirrors and several statues of bronze and marble. But where they  had hoped to find thousands of precious things they have found only  hundreds. Many pedestals are empty of their statues. Here and there the  very paintings have been cut from the walls. Those are the pictures we  should most like to see. How beautiful could they have been?    \"Evidently men came back soon after the eruption,\" say the excavators.  \"The tops of their ruined houses must have stood up above the ashes.  They dug down and rescued their most precious things. We have even found  broken places in walls where we think men dug tunnels from one house to  another. That is why the temple and market place have so few statues.  That is why we find so little jewelry and money and dishes. But we have  enough. The city is our treasure.\"    One rich find they did make, however. There was a pleasant farmhouse out  of town on the slope of Vesuvius. Evidently the man who owned it had  a vineyard and an olive grove and grain fields. For there are olive  presses and wine presses and a great court full of vats for making wine  and a floor for threshing wheat and a mill for grinding flour and a  stable and a wide courtyard that must have held many carts. And there  are bathrooms and many pleasant rooms besides. In the room with the wine  presses was a stone cistern for storing the fresh grape juice. Here  the excavators found a treasure and a mystery. In this cistern lay the  skeleton of a man. With him were a thousand pieces of gold money, some  gold jewelry, and a wonderful dinner set of silver dishes. There are a  hundred and three pieces--plates, platters, cups, bowls. And every one  has beaten up from it beautiful designs of flowers and people. An artist  must have made them, and a rich man must have bought them. How did they  come here in this farmhouse? They must have been meant for a nobleman's  table. Had some thief stolen them and hidden here, only to be caught  by the volcano? Did some rich lady of the city have this farm for her  country place? And had she sent her treasure here to escape when the  volcano burst forth? At any rate here it lay for eighteen hundred years.  And now it is in a museum in Paris, far from its old owner's home.    In this buried city we find the houses in which men lived, the pictures  they loved, the food they ate, the jewels they wore, the cups they drank  from. But what of the people themselves? Were they real men and women?  How did they look? Did they all escape? Not all, for many skeletons have  been found here and there through the city--in the market place, in the  streets, in the houses. And sometimes the excavators have found still  stranger, sadder things. Often as a man has been digging in the  hard-packed ashes, his spade has struck into a hole. Then he has called  the chief excavator.    \"Let us see what it is,\" the excavator has said, \"Perhaps it will be  something interesting.\"    So they have mixed plaster and poured it into the hole. They have given  it a little time to harden and then have dug away the ashes from around  it. In that way they have made a plaster cast just the shape of the  hole. And several times when they have uncovered their cast they have  found it to be the form of a man or woman or child. Perhaps the person  had been hurrying through the street and had stumbled and fallen. The  gases had choked him, the ashes had slowly covered him. Under the  moistening rain and the pressure of all the hundreds of years the ashes  had hardened almost to stone. Meantime the body had decayed and had sunk  down into a handful of dust. But the hardened ashes still stood firm  around the space where the body had been. When this hole was filled with  plaster, the cast took just the form of the one who had been buried  there so long ago--the folds of his clothes, the ring on his finger, the  girl's knot of hair, the negro slave's woolly head. So we can really  look upon the faces of some of the ancient people of Pompeii. And in  another way we can learn the names of many of them.    One of the streets that leads out from the wall is called the \"Street of  Tombs.\" It is the ancient burying ground. You will walk along the paved  street between rows of monuments. Some will be like great square altars  of marble beautifully carved. Some will be tall platforms with steps  leading up. There will be marble benches where you may sit and think of  the old Pompeians who were twice buried in their beautiful tombs. And  there on the marble monument you will see their names carved in old  Latin letters, and kind things that their friends said about them. There  are:    Marcus Cerrinius Restitutus; Aulus Veius, who was several times an  officer of the city; Mamia, a priestess; Marcus Porcius; Numerius  Istacidius and his wife and daughter and others of his family, all in  a great tomb standing on a high platform; Titus Terentius Felix, whose  wife, Fabia Sabina, built his tomb; Tyche, a slave; Aulus Umbricius  Scaurus, whose statue was set up in the market place to do him honor;  Gaius Calventius Quietus, who was given a seat of honor at the theater  on account of his generosity; Naevoleia Tyche, who had once been a slave,  but who had been freed, had married, and grown wealthy and had slaves of  her own; Gnaeus Vibius Saturninus, whose freedman built his tomb; Marcus  Arrius Diomedes, a freedman; Numerius Velasius Gratus, twelve years old;  Salvinus, six years old; and many another.    After seeing the tombs and houses and shops you will leave that little  city, I think, feeling that the people of ancient times were much like  us, that men and mountains have done wonderful things in this old world,  that it is good to know how people of other times lived and worked and  died.          PICTURES OF POMPEII      A ROMAN BOY.    This statue, now in the Metropolitan Museum, was found at Pompeii.  Probably Caius was dressed just like this, and carried such a stick when  he played in his father's courtyard.      THE CITY OF NAPLES, WITH MOUNT VESUVIUS ACROSS THE BAY.      VESUVIUS IN ERUPTION, FROM AN AIRPLANE.    Nowadays men know from history what may happen when Vesuvius wakes. But  in 79 A.D., when Pompeii was buried, the mountain had slept for hundreds  of years, and no man knew that an eruption might bury a city.      POMPEII FROM AN AIRPLANE.    The roofs are all gone and all the partitions inside the houses show.  That is why it all looks so crowded and confused. But if you study it  carefully you can see some interesting things. The big open space is  the forum. It is about five hundred feet long, running northeast and  southwest. South of it is the temple of Apollo. North of it, where you  see the bases of columns in a circle, was the market. Next to the market  is the place where the gods of the city were worshipped. The broad  street beside the forum running southeast is the one down which Ariston  fled. Then he turned into the forum, ran out the gate near the lower end  into the steep street that runs southwest and ends at a city gate near  the sea.      NOLA STREET AND THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNE.    You must imagine this temple with an altar in front, a broad flight of  steps, and a portico of beautiful columns. You can see the street paved  with blocks of lava, the deep wheel ruts, and the stepping stones for  rainy weather.      THE STABIAN GATE.    Pompeii was surrounded by two high walls fifteen feet apart, with earth  between. An embankment of earth was piled up inside also. This is one of  the eight gates in the wall. IN THE STREET OF TOMBS.    On the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche was a carving of a ship gliding into port,  the sailors furling the sails. Within this tomb is a chamber where  funeral urns stand, containing the ashes of Tyche and her husband, and  of the slaves they had freed. Pompeians always burned the bodies of the  dead.      THE AMPHITHEATER.    Like other Roman towns, Pompeii had an amphitheater.

But just let me remind you, you can't go into court with  what I'm saying to you, for _you_ won't be able to produce any collateral  evidence beyond your own word, and John's a man that can do a little hard  swearing if necessary. Very well then, that's understood. Now, I had the  fancy that I wouldn't write this will quite in the common way, so I wrote  it in a book, Mary, a printed book. And there's several thousand books in  this house. But there! you needn't trouble yourself with them, for it  isn't one of them. It's in safe keeping elsewhere: in a place where John  can go and find it any day, if he only knew, and you can't. A good will  it is: properly signed and witnessed, but I don't think you'll find the  witnesses in a hurry.\"    'Still I said nothing: if I had moved at all I must have taken hold of  the old wretch and shaken him. He lay there laughing to himself, and at  last he said:    '\"Well, well, you've taken it very quietly, and as I want to start you  both on equal terms, and John has a bit of a purchase in being able to go  where the book is, I'll tell you just two other things which I didn't  tell him. The will's in English, but you won't know that if ever you see  it. That's one thing, and another is that when I'm gone you'll find an  envelope in my desk directed to you, and inside it something that would  help you to find it, if only you have the wits to use it.\"    'In a few hours from that he was gone, and though I made an appeal to  John Eldred about it--'    'John Eldred? I beg your pardon, Mrs Simpson--I think I've seen a Mr John  Eldred. What is he like to look at?'    'It must be ten years since I saw him: he would be a thin elderly man  now, and unless he has shaved them off, he has that sort of whiskers  which people used to call Dundreary or Piccadilly something.'    '--weepers. Yes, that _is_ the man.'    'Where did you come across him, Mr Garrett?'    'I don't know if I could tell you,' said Garrett mendaciously, 'in some  public place. But you hadn't finished.'    'Really I had nothing much to add, only that John Eldred, of course, paid  no attention whatever to my letters, and has enjoyed the estate ever  since, while my daughter and I have had to take to the lodging-house  business here, which I must say has not turned out by any means so  unpleasant as I feared it might.'    'But about the envelope.'    'To be sure! Why, the puzzle turns on that. Give Mr Garrett the paper out  of my desk.'    It was a small slip, with nothing whatever on it but five numerals, not  divided or punctuated in any way: 11334.    Mr Garrett pondered, but there was a light in his eye. Suddenly he 'made  a face', and then asked, 'Do you suppose that Mr Eldred can have any more  clue than you have to the title of the book?'    'I have sometimes thought he must,' said Mrs Simpson, 'and in this way:  that my uncle must have made the will not very long before he died (that,  I think, he said himself), and got rid of the book immediately  afterwards. But all his books were very carefully catalogued: and John  has the catalogue: and John was most particular that no books whatever  should be sold out of the house. And I'm told that he is always  journeying about to booksellers and libraries; so I fancy that he must  have found out just which books are missing from my uncle's library of  those which are entered in the catalogue, and must be hunting for them.'    'Just so, just so,' said Mr Garrett, and relapsed into thought.           *       *       *       *       *    No later than next day he received a letter which, as he told Mrs Simpson  with great regret, made it absolutely necessary for him to cut short his  stay at Burnstow.    Sorry as he was to leave them (and they were at least as sorry to part  with him), he had begun to feel that a crisis, all-important to Mrs (and  shall we add, Miss?) Simpson, was very possibly supervening.    In the train Garrett was uneasy and excited. He racked his brains to  think whether the press mark of the book which Mr Eldred had been  inquiring after was one in any way corresponding to the numbers on Mrs  Simpson's little bit of paper. But he found to his dismay that the shock  of the previous week had really so upset him that he could neither  remember any vestige of the title or nature of the book, or even of the  locality to which he had gone to seek it. And yet all other parts of  library topography and work were clear as ever in his mind.    And another thing--he stamped with annoyance as he thought of it--he had  at first hesitated, and then had forgotten, to ask Mrs Simpson for the  name of the place where Eldred lived. That, however, he could write  about.    At least he had his clue in the figures on the paper. If they referred to  a press mark in his library, they were only susceptible of a limited  number of interpretations. They might be divided into 1.13.34, 11.33.4,  or 11.3.34. He could try all these in the space of a few minutes, and if  any one were missing he had every means of tracing it. He got very  quickly to work, though a few minutes had to be spent in explaining his  early return to his landlady and his colleagues. 1.13.34. was in place  and contained no extraneous writing. As he drew near to Class 11 in the  same gallery, its association struck him like a chill. But he _must_ go  on. After a cursory glance at 11.33.4 (which first confronted him, and  was a perfectly new book) he ran his eye along the line of quartos which  fills 11.3. The gap he feared was there: 34 was out. A moment was spent  in making sure that it had not been misplaced, and then he was off to the  vestibule.    'Has 11.3.34 gone out? Do you recollect noticing that number?'    'Notice the number? What do you take me for, Mr Garrett? There, take and  look over the tickets for yourself, if you've got a free day before you.'    'Well then, has a Mr Eldred called again?--the old gentleman who came the  day I was taken ill. Come! you'd remember him.'    'What do you suppose? Of course I recollect of him: no, he haven't been  in again, not since you went off for your 'oliday. And yet I seem  to--there now. Roberts'll know. Roberts, do you recollect of the name of  Heldred?'    'Not arf,' said Roberts. 'You mean the man that sent a bob over the price  for the parcel, and I wish they all did.'    'Do you mean to say you've been sending books to Mr Eldred? Come, do  speak up! Have you?'    'Well now, Mr Garrett, if a gentleman sends the ticket all wrote correct  and the secketry says this book may go and the box ready addressed sent  with the note, and a sum of money sufficient to deefray the railway  charges, what would be _your_ action in the matter, Mr Garrett, if I may  take the liberty to ask such a question? Would you or would you not have  taken the trouble to oblige, or would you have chucked the 'ole thing  under the counter and--'    'You were perfectly right, of course, Hodgson--perfectly right: only,  would you kindly oblige me by showing me the ticket Mr Eldred sent, and  letting me know his address?'    'To be sure, Mr Garrett; so long as I'm not 'ectored about and informed  that I don't know my duty, I'm willing to oblige in every way feasible to  my power. There is the ticket on the file. J. Eldred, 11.3.34. Title of  work: T-a-l-m--well, there, you can make what you like of it--not a  novel, I should 'azard the guess. And here is Mr Heldred's note applying  for the book in question, which I see he terms it a track.'    'Thanks, thanks: but the address? There's none on the note.'    'Ah, indeed; well, now ... stay now, Mr Garrett, I 'ave it. Why, that  note come inside of the parcel, which was directed very thoughtful to  save all trouble, ready to be sent back with the book inside; and if I  _have_ made any mistake in this 'ole transaction, it lays just in the one  point that I neglected to enter the address in my little book here what I  keep. Not but what I dare say there was good reasons for me not entering  of it: but there, I haven't the time, neither have you, I dare say, to go  into 'em just now. And--no, Mr Garrett, I do _not_ carry it in my 'ed,  else what would be the use of me keeping this little book here--just a  ordinary common notebook, you see, which I make a practice of entering  all such names and addresses in it as I see fit to do?'    'Admirable arrangement, to be sure--but--all right, thank you. When did  the parcel go off?'    'Half-past ten, this morning.'    'Oh, good; and it's just one now.'    Garrett went upstairs in deep thought. How was he to get the address? A  telegram to Mrs Simpson: he might miss a train by waiting for the answer.  Yes, there was one other way. She had said that Eldred lived on his  uncle's estate. If this were so, he might find that place entered in the  donation-book. That he could run through quickly, now that he knew the  title of the book. The register was soon before him, and, knowing that  the old man had died more than twenty years ago, he gave him a good  margin, and turned back to 1870. There was but one entry possible. 1875,  August 14th. _Talmud: Tractatus Middoth cum comm. R. Nachmanidae._  Amstelod. 1707. Given by J. Rant, D.D., of Bretfield Manor.    A gazetteer showed Bretfield to be three miles from a small station on  the main line. Now to ask the doorkeeper whether he recollected if the  name on the parcel had been anything like Bretfield.    'No, nothing like. It was, now you mention it, Mr Garrett, either  Bredfield or Britfield, but nothing like that other name what you  coated.'    So far well. Next, a time-table. A train could be got in twenty  minutes--taking two hours over the journey. The only chance, but one not  to be missed; and the train was taken.    If he had been fidgety on the journey up, he was almost distracted on the  journey down. If he found Eldred, what could he say? That it had been  discovered that the book was a rarity and must be recalled? An obvious"]]]
