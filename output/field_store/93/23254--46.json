Tuguegarao Air Field Raid: Captain Minton selected some of his  outstanding Scouts for his patrol. Under cover of darkness, Minton and  his men surrounded the Japanese barracks at the Tuguegarao Air Field,  killed some one-hundred Japanese soldiers as they emerged, and  destroyed two planes on the ground.    MacArthur was delighted! He promptly decorated the patrol    and promoted Majors Warner and Nakar to Lt. Cols. and Minton to Major.    The following communique was quickly announced from Corregidor: \"One  of General MacArthur's guerrilla bands, operating in the Cagayan  Valley in northern Luzon, scored a brilliant local success in a  surprise raid on a hostile airdrome at Tuguegarao. The Japanese were  taken completely by surprise and fled in confusion leaving 110 dead on  the field. Approximately three hundred others were put to flight. Our  losses were very light.\"    MacArthur said, \"If Bataan should fall, I'd consider joining the  guerrillas myself.\"    Patrols: Our patrols and outposts harassed the enemy until they  withdrew from the Cagayan Valley late in March. One battalion pursued  the Japs to Balete Pass, where they set up defense positions.  Telephone and courier services were quickly established.    The patrols continued to make raids on enemy held barrios. Normally  two soldiers (former townsmen when possible) entered the selected  barrio as civilians with produce to sell or trade. After making the  necessary observations as to the habits of the enemy, they would  leave. The following dawn, they would cut the telephone lines at each  end of town, and then attack the enemy barracks. Usually food,  supplies and equipment could be obtained, in addition to disrupting  Japanese activities. Any injured soldiers who' could not continue with  the raiding party were cared for by a local civilian family.    Politicians: Riding our horses into town, Col. Nakar and I met  frequently with provincial governors, mayors and engineers to discuss  mutual problems. We helped them police their areas and they helped us  obtain supplies. When a politician became jittery, thinking of  possible punishments if he should be captured, we had to replace him  with a stable official.    We were able to get permission from President Quezon on Corregidor to  print \"emergency money\" to pay the regiment and to purchase the  supplies. The actual printing of the money was done by the provincial  treasurer.    In late February, 1942, President Roosevelt announced that there could  be no attempt to relieve the Philippines. Actually no reinforcements  had reached the Philippines since the first bombing.    Roosevelt directed MacArthur to transfer his headquarters from  Corregidor to Australia. On March 11th, MacArthur and his family, and  some of his staff departed on P.T. boats.    Spanish friends: On Sundays, when things became quiet, Guillermo Nakar  and I liked to ride our horses to a Spanish hacienda across the  Cagayan River to spend several hours \"away\" from the war. We crossed  the river in long bancas (dugout canoes) and swam our horses behind  us, at times fending off rather large crocodiles.    Since Spain was a neutral country, the Japanese did not bother the  Spaniards very much, except indirectly. The Spaniards grew fine  fruits, vegetables and tobacco. They ate and lived well; Guillermo and  I enjoyed sharing a good meal with them.    On my last visit to the hacienda, I gave the Spaniards my movie  camera, Hamilton watch, fountain pen, and a pearl ring I had bought  for Judy, for \"safekeeping\" until the war was over.    About one year after the end of the war, I received them in poor  condition (being buried in the moist ground) from a Spanish priest,  who probably had had great difficulty in locating me; (he wanted money  to help him build a new church).    14th Infantry, Philippine Army: On April 1, 1942, USAFFE HQ on  Corregidor seemed to have learned that guerrilla type warfare was not  in accord with the rules of land warfare. Our regiment received a new  title-we were the\" 14th Infantry of the Philippine Army.\" Our regiment  now controlled the Cagayan Valley, from Tuguegarao in the north to  Balete Pass in the south, and from Kiangan in the west to Palanan and  Casiguran ports on the east coast.    Bataan: The Bataan situation was becoming desperate; rations had been  cut a second time. Soldiers in foxholes were having trouble getting  food. The 26th Cavalry was eating its horses. The 65th Pack Train was  eating its mules. Other soldiers ate trapped dogs, monkeys, lizards;  in fact most anything they could catch.    On Good Friday, 1942, General Homma opened up with his biggest  offensive-all his artillery supported by heavy bombing.    The front line of General Lim's 41st Division was pulverized. Nearly  100,000 seasoned Jap troops were overrunning the cadaverous defenders  of the \"American Way of Life.\" A few terrified and bedraggled remnants  of the native companies were managing to filter back.    General Edward (Ned) King's 11th Division was too exhausted    to plug holes in the 41st Division. The Japs were now penetrating in  large numbers.    On April 8, Gen. King called all his officers together; he tried to  spare his starved, diseased, wounded, and exhausted troops such things  as marching to internment camps; he requested conditions of surrender:    1. A four-hour armistice.    2. Japanese forces to remain in present positions during armistice.    3. Consideration be given for sick and wounded soldiers and civilians.    4. That U.S. Army transportation be used to carry sick and wounded to  any internment camp that the Japanese General may direct. General  Homma's Chief of Staff shouted, \"Yuo vill sullendah unconitionarry!\"       Bataan Falls: On April 9, 1942, starvation, disease and the  ubiquitous Japanese caused the collapse of Bataan. General King became  the first U.S. general ever forced to surrender his command to an  enemy. He referred to his \"heroes of Bataan\" as follows: \"Courage is a  quality God has seen fit to dispense with utmost care. He limits it to  His special favorites. He knows they will reward Him well, using the  power with dignity, strength and distinction. The men of Bataan and  Corregidor were His chosen favorites. They walked through unbearable  hell and labored on-under conditions that history had never recorded.  When they were supposed to be dead, these men of honor rose again-to  battle a cruel enemy with this intangible weapon.\"    \"When history of the Second World War is fully written, Americans will  thrill to the story of the 'Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor!'\"    The fall of Bataan ended any possibility of getting supplies for the  14th Infantry; our patrols had only three rounds of ammunition per  man. We became quite depressed over the surrender of Bataan; we knew  many of our friends there must be dead, wounded or suffering from  starvation and many diseases.    Shortly we received the following order from Corregidor: \"CUT STRENGTH  OF 14TH INFANTRY TO 600! WAINWRIGHT.\" This was a big blow to the whole  regiment.    Thousands of Japs were massed at Balete Pass and moving north into the  Cagayan Valley. Our patrols kept us posted. Col. Warner, becoming  frustrated and trying to determine what    positive effort could be made toward winning the war by his remaining  troops, noted that the 14th Infantry held two valuable ports at  Casiguran and Palanan. He took Major Minton and some Scouts across the  Sierra Madre mountains to the Pacific coast to explore possibilities.  He considered finding or building a good pier for supplies to be  brought in; he looked for suitable beaches for landing craft in the  event of an invasion and as a last resort, boats that could carry  personnel to China.    The Japanese troops were advancing on Echague, some fifteen miles from  Jones. Guillermo was fearful lest the Japanese locate the regimental  radio by triangulation of transmission waves. Guillermo and I, with  several Scouts, got into two bancas and worked our way up the Cagayan  River through a series of rapids to Pinippigan, where we spent the  night. The following day, with the barrio teniente, we looked for  places to hide the radio if it became necessary.    When we returned to Jones, we discharged nine hundred soldiers, to be  sent home, to grease and hide their rifles, to hide their uniforms and  equipment, and to become civilian farmers. They soon earned the  reputation, \"farmers daytime-soldiers nighttime.\"    Corregidor, the \"Rock\": With the fall of Bataan, the Japanese moved  their heavy artillery right into the grounds of our Army hospitals on  Bataan-to concentrate their massive barrages on Corregidor-without  fear of retaliation from the big guns on Corregidor. The shelling and  bombing became relentless for several weeks.    On May 5th, as the Japanese barges were approaching Corregidor,  General Wainwright offered to surrender to General Homma, who replied,  \"Imperial Japanese Army and Navy are only prepared to accept surrender  of all American and Filipino troops in whole Archipelago - Homma.\"    One of the last messages to come from Corregidor: \"Major Eugene C.  Jacobs, M.C., transferred to command of Col. John Horan in Mountain  Province north of Baguio.\"    I reasoned, \"Maybe his heart is giving him trouble and he feels the  need of a doctor.\" My weight was down from 165 to 120 pounds. I had  had amoebic dysentery for several months and had lost considerable  strength. I didn't relish traveling some one hundred to 150 miles  through areas held by the Japanese, to learn that Col. Horan had  already surrendered to the Japanese.        (Later I learned that this is exactly what happened. He surrendered on  May 14, 1942).    Corregidor Falls: With the silencing of the big guns and the radio on  Corregidor on May 6th, we found ourselves unable to contact any ally.

This fact is of special interest, since, if properly  taken advantage of, it is possible to effect its almost complete removal  from the feed-water of boilers,    There is little difference in the solubility of the sulphate of lime  until the temperature has risen somewhat above 212 deg. Fahr., when it  rapidly diminishes, and finally, at nearly 300 deg., all of this salt,  held in solution at lower temperatures, will be precipitated when the  temperature has risen to that point.

Couste, _Annales des Mines_ V 69. _Recherches sur Vincrustation  des Chaudieres a vapour_. Mr. Hugh Lee Pattison, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,  at the meeting of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers of Great  Britain, in August, 1880, remarked on this subject that \"The solubility  of sulphate of lime in water diminishes as the temperature rises. At  ordinary temperatures pure water dissolves about 150 grains of sulphate  of lime per gallon; but at a temperature of 250 deg. Fahr., at which the  pressure of steam is equal to about 2 atmospheres, only about 40 grains  per gallon are held in solution. At a pressure of 3 atmospheres, and  temperature of 302 deg. Fahr., it is practically insoluble. The point  of maximum solubility is about 95 deg. Fahr. The presence of magnesium  chloride, or of calcium chloride, in water, diminishes its power of  dissolving sulphate of lime, while the presence of sodium chloride  increases that power. As an instance of the latter fact, we find a  boiler works much cleaner which is fed alternately with fresh water and  with brackish water pumped from the Tyne when the tide is high than one  which is fed with fresh water constantly.\"]    These figures hold substantially for fresh as well as for sea water, for  the sulphate of lime becomes wholly insoluble in sea water, or in soft  water, at temperatures comprised between 280 deg. and 300 deg. Fahr.    It appears from this that it is simply necessary to heat water up to a  temperature of 250 deg. in order to effect the precipitation of four fifths  of the sulphate of lime it may have contained, or to the temperature of  290 deg. in order to precipitate it entirely. The bearing of these facts on  the purification of feed-waters will appear further on. The explanation  offered to account for the gradually increasing insolubility of sulphate  of lime on heating, is, that the hydrate, in which condition it exists  in solution, is partially decomposed, anhydrous calcic sulphate  being formed, the dehydration becoming more and more complete as the  temperature rises. Sulphate of magnesia, chloride of sodium (common  salt), and all the other more soluble salts contained in natural waters  are likewise precipitated by the process of supersaturation, but owing  to their extreme solubility their precipitation will never be effected  in boilers; all mechanically suspended matter tends naturally to  subside.    Where water containing such mineral and suspended matter is fed to a  steam boiler, there results a combined deposit, of which the carbonate  of lime usually forms the greater part, and which remains more or less  firmly adherent to the inner surfaces of the boiler, undisturbed by the  force of the boiling currents. Gradually accumulating, it becomes harder  and thicker, and, if permitted to accumulate, may at length attain such  thickness as to prevent the proper heating of the water by any fire that  may be maintained in the furnace. Dr. Joseph G. Rogers, who has made  boiler waters and incrustations a subject of careful study, declares  that the high heats necessary to heat water through thick scale will  sometimes actually convert the scale into a species of glass, by  combining the sand, mechanically separated, with the alkaline salts. The  same authority has carefully estimated the non-conducting properties  of such boiler incrustations. On this point he remarks that the evil  effects of the scale are due to the fact that it is relatively a  nonconductor of heat. As compared with iron, its conducting power is  as 1 to 371/2, consequently more fuel is required to heat water in an  incrusted boiler than in the same boiler if clean. Rogers estimates that  a scale 1-16th of an inch thick will require the extra expenditure of  15 per cent. more fuel, and this ratio increases as the scale grows  thicker. Thus, when it is one-quarter of an inch thick, 60 per cent.  more fuel is needed; one-half inch, 112 per cent. more fuel, and so on.    Rogers very forcibly shows the evil consequences to the boiler from the  excessive heating required to raise steam in a badly incrusted boiler,  by the following illustration: To raise steam to a pressure of 90 pounds  the water must be heated to about 320 deg. Fahr. In a clean boiler of  one-quarter inch iron this may be done by heating the external surface  of the shell to about 325 deg. Fahr. If, now, one-half an inch of scale  intervenes between the boiler shell and the water, such is its quality  of resisting the passage of heat that it will be necessary to heat the  fire surface to about 700 deg., almost to a low red heat, to effect the same  result. Now, the higher the temperature at which iron is kept the more  rapidly it oxidizes, and at any heat above 600 deg. it very soon becomes  granular and brittle, and is liable to bulge, crack, or otherwise give  way to the internal pressure. This condition predisposes the boiler to  explosion and makes expensive repairs necessary. The presence of such  scale, also, renders more difficult the raising, maintaining, and  lowering of steam.    The nature of incrustation and the evils resulting therefrom having been  stated, it now remains to consider the methods that have been devised  to overcome them. These methods naturally resolve themselves into  two kinds, chemical and mechanical. The chemical method has two  modifications; in one the design is to purify the water in large tanks  or reservoirs, by the addition of certain substances which shall  precipitate all the scale-forming ingredients before the water is fed  into the boiler; in the other the chemical agent is fed into the boiler  from time to time, and the object is to effect the precipitation of the  saline matter in such a manner that it will not form solid masses of  adherent scale. Where chemical methods of purification are resorted to,  the latter plan is generally followed as being the least troublesome. Of  the many substances used for this purpose, however, some are measurably  successful; the majority of them are unsatisfactory or objectionable.    The mechanical methods are also very various. Picking, scraping,  cleaning, etc., are very generally resorted to, but the scale is so  tenacious that this only partially succeeds, and, as it necessitates  stoppage of work, it is wasteful. In addition to this plan, a great  variety of mechanical contrivances for heating and purifying the  feed-water, by separating and intercepting the saline matter on its  passage through the apparatus, have been devised. Many of these are of  great utility and have come into very general use. In the Western States  especially, where the water in most localities is heavily charged  with lime, these mechanical purifiers have become quite indispensable  wherever steam users are alive to the necessity of generating steam with  economy.    Most of these appliances, however, only partly fulfill their intended  purposes. They consist essentially of a chamber through which the  feed-water is passed, and in which it is heated almost to the boiling  point by exhaust steam from the engine. According to the temperature  to which the water is heated in this chamber, and the length of time  required for its passage through the chamber, the carbonates are more or  less completely precipitated, as likewise the matter held in mechanical  suspension. The precipitated matter subsides on shelves or elsewhere in  the chamber, from which it is removed from time to time. The sulphate  of lime, however, and the other soluble salts, and in some cases also a  portion of the carbonates that were not precipitated during the brief  time of passage through the heater, are passed on into the boiler.    Appreciating this insufficiency of existing feed-water purifiers to  effectually remove these dangerous saline impurities, the writer in  designing the feed-water heater now to be described paid special  attention to the separation of all matters, soluble and insoluble; and  he has succeeded in passing the water to the boilers quite free from any  substance which would cause scaling or coherent deposit. His attention  was called more particularly to the necessity of extreme care in this  respect, through the great annoyance suffered by steam users in the  Central and Western States, where the water is heavily charged with  lime.
