Cut off the flank, take out the bone, and cut it in large slices half an  inch thick, sprinkle some salt and pepper, and broil it, pour over it  nice melted butter with capers; a leg cut in the same way and dressed as  directed for veal cutlets, is very fine. It is also excellent when  salted as beef, and boiled, served up with carrots or turnips.    A shoulder of mutton is best when roasted, but may be made into cutlets  or in a harrico.           *       *       *       *       *    TO HARRICO MUTTON.    Take the nicest part of the rack, divide it into chops, with one bone in  each, beat them flat, sprinkle salt and pepper on them, and broil them  nicely; make a rich gravy out of the inferior parts, season it well with  pepper, a little spice, and any kind of catsup you choose; when  sufficiently done, strain it, and thicken it with butter and brown  flour, have some carrots and turnips cut into small dice and boiled till  tender, put them in the gravy, lay the chops in and stew them fifteen  minutes; serve them up garnished with green pickle.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON CHOPS.    Cut the rack as for the harrico, broil them, and when dished, pour over  them a gravy made with two large spoonsful of boiling water, one of  mushroom catsup, a small spoonful of butter and some salt, stir it till  the butter is melted, and garnish with horse-radish scraped.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED BREAST OF MUTTON.    Separate the joints of the brisket, and saw off the sharp ends of the  ribs, dredge it with flour, and boil it; serve it up covered with  onions--see onion sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAST OF MUTTON IN RAGOUT.    Prepare the breast as for boiling, brown it nicely in the oven, have a  rich gravy well seasoned and thickened with brown flour, stew the mutton  in it till sufficiently done, and garnish with forcemeat balls fried.           *       *       *       *       *    TO GRILL A BREAST OF MUTTON.    Prepare it as before, score the top, wash it over with the yelk of an  egg, sprinkle some salt, and cover it with bread crumbs, bake it, and  pour caper sauce in the dish. It may also be roasted, the skin taken off  and frothed nicely, serve it up with good gravy, and garnish with  current jelly cut in slices.    The neck of mutton is fit only for soup, the liver is very good when  broiled.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED SHOULDER OF MUTTON.    Put it in cold water with some salt, and boil it till tender; serve it  up covered with onion sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    SHOULDER OF MUTTON WITH CELERY SAUCE.    Wash and clean ten heads of celery, cut off the green tops and take off  the outside stalks, cut the heads in thin slices, boil them tender in a  little milk, just enough for gravy, add salt, and thicken it with a  spoonful of butter and some white flour; boil the shoulder and pour the  sauce over it.           *       *       *       *       *    ROASTED LOIN OF MUTTON.    Cut the loin in four pieces, take off the skin, rub each piece with  salt, wash them with the yelk of an egg, and cover them thickly with  bread crumbs, chopped parsley, pepper and salt; wrap them up securely in  paper, put them on a bird spit, and roast them; put a little brown gravy  in the dish, and garnish with pickle.           *       *       *       *       *      PORK.      TO CURE BACON.    Hogs are in the highest perfection, from two and a half to four years  old, and make the best bacon, when they do not weigh more than one  hundred and fifty or sixty at farthest; they should be fed with corn,  six weeks at least, before they are killed, and the shorter distance  they are driven to market, the better will their flesh be. To secure  them against the possibility of spoiling, salt them before they get  cold; take out the chine or back-bone from the neck to the tail, cut the  hams, shoulders and middlings; take the ribs from the shoulders and the  leaf fat from the hams: have such tubs as are directed for beef, rub a  large table spoonful of saltpetre on the inside of each ham, for some  minutes, then rub both sides well with salt, sprinkle the bottom of the  tub with salt, lay the hams with the skin downward, and put a good deal  of salt between each layer; salt the shoulders and middlings in the same  manner, but less saltpetre is necessary; cut the jowl or chop from the  head, and rub it with salt and saltpetre. You should cut off the feet  just above the knee joint; take off the ears and nose, and lay them in a  large tub of cold water for souse. When the jowls have been in salt two  weeks, hang them up to smoke--do so with the shoulders and middlings at  the end of three weeks, and the hams at the end of four. If they remain  longer in salt they will be hard. Remember to hang the hams and  shoulders with the hocks down, to preserve the juices. Make a good smoke  every morning, and be careful not to have a blaze; the smoke-house  should stand alone, for any additional heat will spoil the meat. During  the hot weather, beginning the first of April, it should be occasionally  taken down, examined--rubbed with hickory ashes, and hung up again.    The generally received opinion that saltpetre hardens meat, is entirely  erroneous:--it tends greatly to prevent putrefaction, but will not make  it hard; neither will laying in brine five or six weeks in cold weather,  have that effect, but remaining in salt too long, will certainly draw  off the juices, and harden it. Bacon should be boiled in a large  quantity of water, and a ham is not done sufficiently, till the bone on  the under part comes off with ease. New bacon requires much longer  boiling than that which is old.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SOUSE.    Let all the pieces you intend to souse, remain covered with cold water  twelve hours; then wash them out, wipe off the blood, and put them again  in fresh water; soak them in this manner, changing the water frequently,  and keeping it in a cool place, till the blood is drawn away; scrape and  clean each piece perfectly nice, mix some meal with water, add salt to  it, and boil your souse gently, until you can run a straw into the skin  with ease. Do not put too much in the pot, for it will boil to pieces  and spoil the appearance. The best way is to boil the feet in one pot,  the ears and nose in another, and the heads in a third; these should be  boiled till you can take all the bones out; let them get cold, season  the insides with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg; make it in a tight  roll, sew it up close in a cloth, and press it lightly. Mix some more  meal and cold water, just enough to look white; add salt, and one-fourth  of vinegar; put your souse in different pots, and keep it well covered  with this mixture, and closely stopped. It will be necessary to renew  this liquor every two or three weeks. Let your souse get quite cold  after boiling, before you put it in the liquor, and be sure to use pale  coloured vinegar, or the souse will be dark. Some cooks singe the hair  from the feet, _etcetera_, but this destroys the colour: good souse will  always be white.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST A PIG.    The pig must be very fat, nicely cleaned, and not too large to lie in  the dish; chop the liver fine and mix it with crumbs of bread, chopped  onion and parsley, with pepper and salt, make it into a paste with  butter and an egg, stuff the body well with it, and sew it up, spit it,  and have a clear fire to roast it; baste with salt and water at first,  then rub it frequently with a lump of lard wrapped in a piece of clean  linen; this will make it much more crisp than basting it from the  dripping pan. When the pig is done, take off the head, separate the face  from the chop, cut both in two and take off the ears, take out the  stuffing, split the pig in two parts lengthways, lay it in the dish with  the head, ears, and feet, which have been cut off, placed on each side,  put the stuffing in a bowl with a glass of wine, and as much dripping as  will make it sufficiently liquid, put some of it under the pig, and  serve the rest in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BARBECUE SHOTE.[1]    This is the name given in the southern states to a fat young hog, which,  when the head and feet are taken off, and it is cut into four quarters,  will weigh six pounds per quarter. Take a fore-quarter, make several  incisions between the ribs, and stuff it with rich forcemeat; put it in  a pan with a pint of water, two cloves of garlic, pepper, salt, two  gills of red wine, and two of mushroom catsup, bake it, and thicken the  gravy with batter and brown flour; it must be jointed, and the ribs cut  across before it is cooked; or it cannot be carved well; lay it in the  dish with the ribs uppermost; if it be not sufficiently brown, add a  little burnt sugar to the gravy, garnish with balls.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST A FORE-QUARTER OF SHOTE.    Joint it for the convenience of carving, roast it before a brisk fire;  when done, take the skin off, dredge and froth it, put a little melted  butter with some caper vinegar over it, or serve it with mint sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SHOTE CUTLETS.    Take the skin from the hind-quarter, and cut it in pieces, prepare them  in the way directed for veal cutlets, make a little nice gravy with the  skin and the scraps of meat left, thicken it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#8)"],[1,"ntire;  several animals were found in their perfect state when the one I allude to  was cut open.    There is also an immense animal of this species, which I have heard the  natives of this part of the coast describe, often exceeding 30 feet in  length, and of an enormous size; it is variegated with spots, and the head  is covered with scales; the tongue is fleshy and forked, but its bite is  not poisonous; it is to be found in the recesses of caves and thickets,  from whence it suddenly darts upon its victim, whether man or beast: it  frequently chooses a tree, from which it reconnoitres the passing objects,  supporting itself by the tail, which it twists round the trunk or branches:  when it seizes animals, especially those of the larger kind, such as lions,  tigers, &c. it dexterously, and almost instantaneously twists itself round  their bodies in several folds, and by its powerful muscular force, breaks  the bones, and bruises it in all its parts; when this is done it covers the  animal with a viscous cohesive saliva, by licking its body with its tongue,  which facilitates the power of swallowing it entire; this process is  tedious, and it gradually sucks in the body, which, if large, renders it  incapable of moving for some time, until it digests; and this is the period  which the hunters watch to destroy it: it makes a hissing noise like a  serpent, and has recourse to a variety of expedients to conceal itself; it  is called by the natives _Tinnui_, and is what I apprehend naturalists term  the species of _Boa constrictor_: it is most commonly found in the sultry  climates of Africa, and I believe is also an inhabitant of Asia and  America.    Insects are extremely numerous, of a nondescript species, and exceedingly  beautiful: the most singular are termites, destructive to houses and fences  built of wood; ants, causing ruin to provisions; cockroaches and crickets,  destroying leather, linen, and clothes; musquitos, sand-flies, centipedes,  scorpions; and wild bees, which are very productive of honey. The vermis  and large barnacles abound, which are so destructive to shipping without  copper bottoms.    Esculent vegetables are various: Rice, which forms the chief part of the  African's sustenance. The rice-fields or _lugars_ are prepared during the  dry season, and the seed is sown in the tornado season, requiring about  four or five months growth to bring it to perfection.    Yams, a nutritious substance, known in the West Indies.    _Cassada_ or _cassava_, a root, of a pleasant taste when roasted or boiled,  and makes an excellent cake, superior in whiteness to flour.    Papaw, of a deep green in its growth, but yellqw when ripe, and is an  excellent dish when boiled; its leaves are frequently used by the natives  for soap; ropes are made of the bark.    Oranges and limes are in great abundance, and of superior quality,  throughout the year; but lemons degenerate much in their growth, and in a  few years are scarcely to be distinguished from the latter. Guavas,  pumpkins, or pumpions, squash water mellons, musk mellons, and cucumbers,  grow in the greatest perfection. The pumpkins grow in wild exuberance  throughout the year, and make a good pudding or pie.    Indian corn, or maize, may be reaped several times throughout the year,  only requiring about three months growth.    Millet, with a multiplicity too tedious to enumerate.    Sugar canes are not very abundant, but are of a good quality, which, under  careful management and industry, would, no doubt, yield productive returns.    Coffee trees, of different nondescript species, only requiring the same  interference.    Dyes, of infinite variety and superior texture: yellow is procured from the  butter and tallow tree, producing a juice resembling gamboge, but more  cohesive, and of a darker colour; the wood of this tree is firm, and  adapted to a variety of purposes; its fruit is about the size of a tennis  ball, nearly oval, thick in the rind, and of a pleasant acid taste,  containing several seeds about the size of a walnut, and yielding a viscous  substance used by the natives in their food. Red and black are procured  from a variety of other trees and plants; and indigo growing in wild  exuberance, particularly in the rivers more to the northward.    Cotton, in great varieties, requiring only cultivation to raise it to  perfection and amount. The natives manufacture from it a narrow cloth,  which is made from thread, spun in a manner similar to the distaff.    A species of silk cotton, or ether down, is produced on a large tree,  called the pullam tree. The quantity which the usual size bears may be  computed at about 4 cwt. in pods of 6 to 9 inches long, 4-1/2 in  circumference, and about 1-1/2 inch in diameter, which, upon being exposed  to the heat of the sun, is distended to an incredible bulk. It is much  superior to down for the couch, and, from its elasticity, might be of great  utility in the manufacture of hats. This tree is in great estimation among  the Africans, and is frequently regarded by them as their _Fetish_. Every  town almost has a tree of this species towering over its huts, which its  chief tells the traveller with exultation he or his father planted.    Tobacco is uncertain, but I entertain very little doubt that it might be  raised upon the more luxuriant soils.    Pepper, more particularly near Cape Mount, of several sorts, Maboobo,  Massaaba, Massa, Amquona, Tosan, &c.; the three first are of a weaker  flavour, and are oblong and angular in their seeds; but the last excels in  pungency, and is the native Malaguetta pepper of Africa.    The bread-fruit tree, is similar in appearance to the apple tree, and grows  in the low sandy situations of the Boolum shore, producing a fruit  exceedingly nutritious, and larger than an apple.    Tamarinds in great variety and plenty: the velvet tamarind abounds in the  Bananas, also the white and brown; but the latter are most in esteem, and  are very fine.    Okras, the fruit of a small tree, resembling the English mallows, which put  into soup gives it a gelatine quality, highly alimental; the leaves make a  good spinage.    The palm tree, producing the oil so denominated, is one of the most useful  trees to the African, yielding him meat, drink, and raiment. Where it  grows, it is an indication of a good soil. It is remarkably tall, without  branches, having regular and gradual protuberances, from the bottom towards  the top, ending in five or six clusters of nuts, shaded by large deciduous  leaves. The nuts, which are about the size of a hazle nut, have a hard  kernel, encompassed by a clammy unctuous substance, covered by a thin skin,  and the oil is produced from them by being exposed to the sun, which, by  its influence, opens the juices; subsequent to this exposure, the nuts are  put into a boiler full of water, and a liquid, in the process of boiling,  flows upon the top, which when skimmed off, soon hardens and turns rancid;  the kernel of the nut, after this process, is taken out of the boiler, beat  in a paloon, and put into clear water, the shell of the nut sinks, and its  contents float upon the surface, which, when skimmed as before, is finally  put into a pot, fried, and carefully poured off, producing another kind of  oil, used as butter, and having in a great degree its quality.    The wine is extracted from the tree by forming an incision at the bottom of  every cluster of nuts, from each of which flows about a gallon of wine per  day, for a week, when they are closed until the ensuing season. The liquid,  when newly taken from the tree, resembles whey, and in that state has a  sweetish agreeable taste, but it soon ferments and grows sour, changing to  a strong vinegar of a disagreeable smell: in its fermented state it is most  esteemed by the natives, and is productive of inebriety.    A substance overtops the clusters about 10 or 12 inches in diameter, and 3  or 4 feet in height, in a full grown tree, from whence proceeds a stalk,  about 4 inches in length, which, on being boiled in water, makes an  excellent vegetable resembling cabbage, or rather, in taste, the  cauliflower; the leaves of the tree are converted by the natives into  baskets, fishing nets, and cloth.    MEDICINAL PLANTS. _Colla_ is highly esteemed by the natives, and they  attribute to it the virtues of Peruvian bark; the Portuguese, ascribe the  same quality to it, and dispatch from their factories small vessels to  collect all they can procure.    _Castor Oil Rhinum_.-The bush which produces the bud from which this oil  and valuable medicine is extracted, grows in great exuberance upon the  Windward Coast, and its vicinity. A species of bark is in great abundance  also, and is said to be equal in virtue to the Peruvian.    The foregoing enumeration of natural productions, is the result of  unscientific enquiry only; but unquestionably, industrious and professional  research, would discover infinitely more to philosophic and commercial  contemplation, and develope  the arcana of nature, dormant here through  ignorance and barbarism.    On the 10th of May, I set out from Bance Island, with the view of exploring  the two branches of the Sierra Leone river, the Rochelle, and the Port  Logo. After rowing a few hours I arrived at the factory of Miffare,  formerly occupied by a Mr. Berauld, a Frenchman, but now attached to Bance  Island.    Mr. Hodgkin, with his people, then in possession of the factory,  accompanied me up the Port Logo branch the following morning, taking a  number of towns in our way, and visiting the chiefs. The course of this  branch of the river is extremely serpentine, and is navigable for light  vessels to a little way from the town of Port Logo which is now the  residence of Alimami, a Mandingo chief, who assumes the title of emperor.  The banks are overgrown with the mangrove tree, interwoven together, so as  to form an almost impenetrable thicket, excluding the air, which,"]]]
