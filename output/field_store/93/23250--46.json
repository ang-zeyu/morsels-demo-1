Let us then return each  to his own; but him leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of  Hypsipyle until he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there  come to him great glory.\"    (ll. 875-887) Thus did he chide the band; but no one dared to meet his  eye or to utter a word in answer. But just as they were in the assembly  they made ready their departure in all haste, and the women came running  towards them, when they knew their intent. And as when bees hum round  fair lilies pouring forth from their hive in the rock, and all around  the dewy meadow rejoices, and they gather the sweet fruit, flitting from  one to another; even so the women eagerly poured forth clustering round  the men with loud lament, and greeted each one with hands and voice,  praying the blessed gods to grant him a safe return. And so Hypsipyle  too prayed, seizing the hands of Aeson's son, and her tears flowed for  the loss of her lover:    (ll. 888-898) \"Go, and may heaven bring thee back again with thy  comrades unharmed, bearing to the king the golden fleece, even as thou  wilt and thy heart desireth; and this island and my father's sceptre  will be awaiting thee, if on thy return hereafter thou shouldst choose  to come hither again; and easily couldst thou gather a countless host  of men from other cities. But thou wilt not have this desire, nor do I  myself forbode that so it will be. Still remember Hypsipyle when thou  art far away and when thou hast returned; and leave me some word of  bidding, which I will gladly accomplish, if haply heaven shall grant me  to be a mother.\"    (ll. 899-909) And Aeson's son in admiration thus replied: \"Hypsipyle, so  may all these things prove propitious by the favour of the blessed gods.  But do thou hold a nobler thought of me, since by the grace of Pelias it  is enough for me to dwell in my native land; may the gods only release  me from my toils. But if it is not my destiny to sail afar and return  to the land of Hellas, and if thou shouldst bear a male child, send him  when grown up to Pelasgian Iolcus, to heal the grief of my father and  mother if so be that he find them still living, in order that, far away  from the king, they may be cared for by their own hearth in their home.\"    (ll. 910-921) He spake, and mounted the ship first of all; and so the  rest of the chiefs followed, and, sitting in order, seized the oars;  and Argus loosed for them the hawsers from under the sea-beaten rock.  Whereupon they mightily smote the water with their long oars, and in  the evening by the injunctions of Orpheus they touched at the island of  Electra, [1105] daughter of Atlas, in order that by gentle initiation  they might learn the rites that may not be uttered, and so with greater  safety sail over the chilling sea. Of these I will make no further  mention; but I bid farewell to the island itself and the indwelling  deities, to whom belong those mysteries, which it is not lawful for me  to sing.    (ll. 922-935) Thence did they row with eagerness over the depths of  the black Sea, having on the one side the land of the Thracians, on the  other Imbros on the south; and as the sun was just setting they reached  the foreland of the Chersonesus. There a strong south wind blew for  them; and raising the sails to the breeze they entered the swift stream  of the maiden daughter of Athamas; and at dawn the sea to the north was  left behind and at night they were coasting inside the Rhoeteian shore,  with the land of Ida on their right. And leaving Dardania they directed  their course to Abydus, and after it they sailed past Percote and the  sandy beach of Abarnis and divine Pityeia. And in that night, as the  ship sped on by sail and oar, they passed right through the Hellespont  dark-gleaming with eddies.    (ll. 936-960) There is a lofty island inside the Propontis, a short  distance from the Phrygian mainland with its rich cornfields, sloping  to the sea, where an isthmus in front of the mainland is flooded by the  waves, so low does it lie. And the isthmus has double shores, and they  lie beyond the river Aesepus, and the inhabitants round about call the  island the Mount of Bears. And insolent and fierce men dwell there,  Earthborn, a great marvel to the neighbours to behold; for each one has  six mighty hands to lift up, two from his sturdy shoulders, and four  below, fitting close to his terrible sides. And about the isthmus and  the plain the Doliones had their dwelling, and over them Cyzicus son of  Aeneus was king, whom Aenete the daughter of goodly Eusorus bare. But  these men the Earthborn monsters, fearful though they were, in nowise  harried, owing to the protection of Poseidon; for from him had the  Doliones first sprung. Thither Argo pressed on, driven by the winds of  Thrace, and the Fair haven received her as she sped. There they cast  away their small anchorstone by the advice of Tiphys and left it beneath  a fountain, the fountain of Artaeie; and they took another meet for  their purpose, a heavy one; but the first, according to the oracle of  the Far-Darter, the Ionians, sons of Neleus, in after days laid to be a  sacred stone, as was right, in the temple of Jasonian Athena.    (ll. 961-988) Now the Doliones and Cyzicus himself all came together to  meet them with friendliness, and when they knew of the quest and their  lineage welcomed them with hospitality, and persuaded them to row  further and to fasten their ship's hawsers at the city harbour. Here  they built an altar to Ecbasian Apollo [1106] and set it up on the  beach, and gave heed to sacrifices. And the king of his own bounty gave  them sweet wine and sheep in their need; for he had heard a report that  whenever a godlike band of heroes should come, straightway he should  meet it with gentle words and should have no thought of war. As with  Jason, the soft down was just blooming on his chin, nor yet had it been  his lot to rejoice in children, but still in his palace his wife was  untouched by the pangs of child-birth, the daughter of Percosian Merops,  fair-haired Cleite, whom lately by priceless gifts he had brought from  her father's home from the mainland opposite. But even so he left his  chamber and bridal bed and prepared a banquet among the strangers,  casting all fears from his heart. And they questioned one another in  turn. Of them would he learn the end of their voyage and the injunctions  of Pelias; while they enquired about the cities of the people round and  all the gulf of the wide Propontis; but further he could not tell  them for all their desire to learn. In the morning they climbed mighty  Dindymum that they might themselves behold the various paths of that  sea; and they brought their ship from its former anchorage to the  harbour, Chytus; and the path they trod is named the path of Jason.    (ll. 989-1011) But the Earthborn men on the other side rushed down from  the mountain and with crags below blocked up the mouth of vast Chytus  towards the sea, like men lying in wait for a wild beast within. But  there Heracles had been left behind with the younger heroes and he  quickly bent his back-springing bow against the monsters and brought  them to earth one after another; and they in their turn raised huge  ragged rocks and hurled them. For these dread monsters too, I ween, the  goddess Hera, bride of Zeus, had nurtured to be a trial for Heracles.  And therewithal came the rest of the martial heroes returning to meet  the foe before they reached the height of outlook, and they fell to the  slaughter of the Earthborn, receiving them with arrows and spears  until they slew them all as they rushed fiercely to battle. And as when  woodcutters cast in rows upon the beach long trees just hewn down by  their axes, in order that, once sodden with brine, they may receive  the strong bolts; so these monsters at the entrance of the foam-fringed  harbour lay stretched one after another, some in heaps bending their  heads and breasts into the salt waves with their limbs spread out above  on the land; others again were resting their heads on the sand of the  shore and their feet in the deep water, both alike a prey to birds and  fishes at once.    (ll. 1012-1076) But the heroes, when the contest was ended without  fear, loosed the ship's hawsers to the breath of the wind and pressed on  through the sea-swell. And the ship sped on under sail all day; but when  night came the rushing wind did not hold steadfast, but contrary blasts  caught them and held them back till they again approached the hospitable  Doliones. And they stepped ashore that same night; and the rock is still  called the Sacred Rock round which they threw the ship's hawsers in  their haste. Nor did anyone note with care that it was the same island;  nor in the night did the Doliones clearly perceive that the heroes were  returning; but they deemed that Pelasgian war-men of the Macrians  had landed. Therefore they donned their armour and raised their hands  against them. And with clashing of ashen spears and shields they fell on  each other, like the swift rush of fire which falls on dry brushwood and  rears its crest; and the din of battle, terrible and furious, fell upon  the people of the Doliones. Nor was the king to escape his fate and  return home from battle to his bridal chamber and bed. But Aeson's son  leapt upon him as he turned to face him, and smote him in the middle  of the breast, and the bone was shattered round the spear; he rolled  forward in the sand and filled up the measure of his fate. For that no  mortal may escape; but on every side a wide snare encompasses us. And  so, when he thought that he had escaped bitter death from the chiefs,  fate entangled him that very night in her toils while battling with  them; and many champions withal were slain; Heracles killed Telecles  and Megabrontes, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#7)"],[1,"draw off from each other the space of an acre, then  drive their horses together; they reach for each other with the tips of  their lances, and strike each other so hard that the shields are pierced  and broken; the lances split and crack; the saddle-bows are knocked to  bits behind. They must needs lose their stirrups, so that they both fall  to the ground, and the horses run off across the field. Though smitten  with the lances, they are quickly on their feet again, and draw their  swords from the scabbards. With great fierceness they attack each other,  and exchange great sword blows, so that the helmets are crushed and made  to ring. Fierce is the clash of the swords, as they rain great blows  upon neck and shoulders. For this is no mere sport: they break whatever  they touch, cutting the shields and shattering the hauberks. The swords  are red with crimson blood. Long the battle lasts; but they fight so  lustily that they become weary and listless. Both the damsels are in  tears, and each knight sees his lady weep and raise her hands to God and  pray that He may give the honours of the battle to the one who strives  for her. \"Ha! vassal,\" quoth the knight to Erec, \"let us withdraw and  rest a little; for too weak are these blows we deal. We must deal better  blows than these; for now it draws near evening. It is shameful and  highly discreditable that this battle should last so long. See yonder  that gentle maid who weeps for thee and calls on God. Full sweetly she  prays for thee, as does also mine for me. Surely we should do our best  with our blades of steel for the sake of our lady-loves.\" Erec replies:  \"You have spoken well.\" Then they take a little rest, Erec looking  toward his lady as she softly prays for him. While he sat and looked  on her, great strength was recruited within him. Her love and beauty  inspired him with great boldness. He remembered the Queen, to whom he  pledged his word that he would avenge the insult done him, or would make  it greater yet. \"Ah! wretch,\" says he, \"why do I wait? I have not yet  taken vengeance for the injury which this vassal permitted when his  dwarf struck me in the wood.\" His anger is revived within him as he  summons the knight: \"Vassal,\" quoth he, \"I call you to battle anew. Too  long we have rested; let us now renew our strife.\" And he replies: \"That  is no hardship to me.\" Whereupon, they again fall upon each other.  They were both expert fencers. At his first lunge the knight would have  wounded Erec had he not skilfully parried. Even so, he smote him so  hard over the shield beside his temple that he struck a piece from his  helmet. Closely shaving his white coif, the sword descends, cleaving the  shield through to the buckle, and cutting more than a span from the side  of his hauberk. Then he must have been well stunned, as the cold steel  penetrated to the flesh on his thigh. May God protect him now! If the  blow had not glanced off, it would have cut right through his body. But  Erec is in no wise dismayed: he pays him back what is owing him, and.  attacking him boldly, smites him upon the shoulder so violently a blow  that the shield cannot withstand it, nor is the hauberk of any use to  prevent the sword from penetrating to the bone. He made the crimson  blood flow down to his waist-band. Both of the vassals are hard  fighters: they fight with honours even, for one cannot gain from the  other a single foot of ground. Their hauberks are so torn and their  shields so hacked, that there is actually not enough of them left to  serve as a protection. So they fight all exposed. Each one loses a deal  of blood, and both grow weak. He strikes Erec and Erec strikes him. Erec  deals him such a tremendous blow upon the helmet that he quite stuns  him. Then he lets him have it again and again, giving him three blows  in quick succession, which entirely split the helmet and cut the coif  beneath it. The sword even reaches the skull and cuts a bone of his  head, but without penetrating the brain. He stumbles and totters, and  while he staggers, Erec pushes him over, so that he falls upon his right  side. Erec grabs him by the helmet and forcibly drags it from his  head, and unlaces the ventail, so that his head and face are completely  exposed. When Erec thinks of the insult done him by the dwarf in the  wood, he would have cut off his head, had he not cried for mercy. \"Ah!  vassal,\" says he, \"thou hast defeated me. Mercy now, and do not kill me,  after having overcome me and taken me prisoner: that would never bring  thee praise or glory. If thou shouldst touch me more, thou wouldst do  great villainy. Take here my sword; I yield it thee.\" Erec, however,  does not take it, but says in reply: \"I am within an ace of killing  thee.\" \"Ah! gentle knight, mercy! For what crime, indeed, or for what  wrong shouldst thou hate me with mortal hatred? I never saw thee before  that I am aware, and never have I been engaged in doing thee any shame  or wrong.\" Erec replies: \"Indeed you have.\" \"Ah, sire, tell me when! For  I never saw you, that I can remember, and if I have done you any wrong,  I place myself at your mercy.\" Then Erec said: \"Vassal, I am he who was  in the forest yesterday with Queen Guinevere, when thou didst allow thy  ill-bred dwarf to strike my lady's damsel. It is disgraceful to strike  a woman. And afterwards he struck me, taking me for some common fellow.  Thou wast guilty of too great insolence when thou sawest such an outrage  and didst complacently permit such a monster of a lout to strike the  damsel and myself. For such a crime I may well hate thee; for thou  hast committed a grave offence. Thou shalt now constitute thyself my  prisoner, and without delay go straight to my lady whom thou wilt surely  find at Cardigan, if thither thou takest thy way. Thou wilt reach there  this very night, for it is not seven leagues from here, I think. Thou  shalt hand over to her thyself, thy damsel, and thy dwarf, to do as she  may dictate; and tell her that I send her word that to-morrow I shall  come contented, bringing with me a damsel so fair and wise and fine  that in all the world she has not her match. So much thou mayst tell her  truthfully. And now I wish to know thy name.\" Then he must needs say in  spite of himself: \"Sire, my name is Yder, son of Nut. This morning I had  not thought that any single man by force of arms could conquer me. Now  I have found by experience a man who is better than I. You are a very  valiant knight, and I pledge you my faith here and now that I will go  without delay and put myself in the Queen's hands. But tell me without  reserve what your name may be. Who shall I say it is that sends me? For  I am ready to start.\" And he replies: \"My name I will tell thee without  disguise: it is Erec. Go, and tell her that it is I who have sent thee  to her.\" \"Now I'll go, and I promise you that I will put my dwarf, my  damsel, and myself altogether at her disposal (you need have no fear),  and I will give her news of you and of your damsel.\" Then Erec received  his plighted word, and the Count and all the people round about the  ladies and the gentlemen were present at the agreement. Some were  joyous, and some downcast; some were sorry, and others glad. The most  rejoiced for the sake of the damsel with the white raiment, the daughter  of the poor vavasor she of the gentle and open heart; but his damsel and  those who were devoted to him were sorry for Yder.    (Vv. 1081-1170.) Yder, compelled to execute his promise, did not wish  to tarry longer, but mounted his steed at once. But why should I make  a long story? Taking his dwarf and his damsel, they traversed the woods  and the plain, going on straight until they came to Cardigan. In the  bower [112] outside the great hall, Gawain and Kay the seneschal and a  great number of other lords were gathered. The seneschal was the first  to espy those approaching, and said to my lord Gawain: \"Sire, my heart  divines that the vassal who yonder comes is he of whom the Queen spoke  as having yesterday done her such an insult. If I am not mistaken, there  are three in the party, for I see the dwarf and the damsel.\" \"That is  so,\" says my lord Gawain; \"it is surely a damsel and a dwarf who are  coming straight toward us with the knight. The knight himself is fully  armed, but his shield is not whole. If the Queen should see him,  she would know him. Hello, seneschal, go call her now!\" So he went  straightway and found her in one of the apartments. \"My lady,\" says he,  \"do you remember the dwarf who yesterday angered you by wounding your  damsel?\" \"Yes, I remember him right well. Seneschal, have you any  news of him? Why have you mentioned him?\" \"Lady, because I have seen a  knight-errant armed coming upon a grey horse, and if my eyes have not  deceived me, I saw a damsel with him; and it seems to me that with him  comes the dwarf, who still holds the scourge from which Erec received  his lashing.\" Then the Queen rose quickly and said: \"Let us go quickly,  seneschal, to see if it is the vassal. If it is he, you may be sure that  I shall tell you so, as soon as I see him.\" And Kay said: \"I will show  him to you. Come up into the bower where your knights are assembled. It  was from there we saw him coming, and my lord Gawain himself awaits  you there. My lady, let us hasten thither, for here we have too long  delayed.\" Then the Queen bestirred herself, and coming to the windows  she took her stand by my lord Gawain, and straightway recognised the  knight. \"Ha! my lords,\" she cries, \"it is he. He has been through great  danger. He has been in a battle. I do not know whether Erec has avenged  his grief, or whether this knight has defeated Erec. But there is many a  dent upon his shield, and his hauberk is covered with blood, so that it  is rather red than white.\" \"In sooth, my lady,\" quoth my lord Gawain,  \"I am very sure that you are quite right. His hauberk is covered with  blood, and"]]]
