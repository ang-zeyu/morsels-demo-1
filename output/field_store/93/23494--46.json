The mind of one  who has led a quiet, uneventful life is not apt to take in contradictory  feelings at the same moment and balance them, but rather to be  overpowered by each in turn. While Gerard was with the Countess, the  excitement of so new a situation, the unlooked-for promise the joy  and pride it would cause at home, possessed him wholly; but now it was  passion's turn to be heard again. What! give up Margaret, whose soft  hand he still felt in his, and her deep eyes in his heart? resign her  and all the world of love and joy she had opened on him to-day? The  revulsion, when it did come, was so strong that he hastily resolved  to say nothing at home about the offered benefice. \"The Countess is  so good,\" thought he, \"she has a hundred ways of aiding a young man's  fortune: she will not compel me to be a priest when she shall learn I  love one of her sex: one would almost think she does know it, for she  cast a strange look on me, and said, 'A priest gives up much, too much.'  I dare say she will give me a place about the palace.\" And with this  hopeful reflection his mind was eased, and, being now at the entrance  of the banqueting hall, he thanked his conductor, and ran hastily with  joyful eyes to Margaret. He came in sight of the table--she was gone.  Peter was gone too. Nobody was at the table at all; only a citizen in  sober garments had just tumbled under it dead drunk, and several persons  were raising him to carry him away. Gerard never guessed how important  this solemn drunkard was to him: he was looking for \"Beauty,\" and  let the \"Beast\" lie. He ran wildly round the hall, which was now  comparatively empty. She was not there. He left the palace: outside he  found a crowd gaping at two great fan-lights just lighted over the gate.  He asked them earnestly if they had seen an old man in a gown, and a  lovely girl pass out. They laughed at the question. \"They were staring  at these new lights that turn night into day. They didn't trouble their  heads about old men and young wenches, every-day sights.\" From another  group he learned there was a Mystery being played under canvas hard by,  and all the world gone to see it. This revived his hopes, and he went  and saw the Mystery.    In this representation divine personages, too sacred for me to name  here, came clumsily down from heaven to talk sophistry with the cardinal  Virtues, the nine Muses, and the seven deadly sins, all present in  human shape, and not unlike one another. To enliven which weary stuff  in rattled the Prince of the power of the air, and an imp that kept  molesting him and buffeting him with a bladder, at each thwack of which  the crowd were in ecstasies. When the Vices had uttered good store of  obscenity and the Virtues twaddle, the celestials, including the nine  Muses went gingerly back to heaven one by one; for there was but one  cloud; and two artisans worked it up with its supernatural freight,  and worked it down with a winch, in full sight of the audience. These  disposed of, the bottomless pit opened and flamed in the centre of the  stage; the carpenters and Virtues shoved the Vices in, and the Virtues  and Beelzebub and his tormentor danced merrily round the place of  eternal torture to the fife and tabor.    This entertainment was writ by the Bishop of Ghent for the diffusion  of religious sentiment by the aid of the senses, and was an average  specimen of theatrical exhibitions so long as they were in the hands of  the clergy. But, in course of time, the laity conducted plays, and so  the theatre, I learn from the pulpit, has become profane.    Margaret was nowhere in the crowd, and Gerard could not enjoy the  performance; he actually went away in Act 2, in the midst of a  much-admired piece of dialogue, in which Justice out-quibbled Satan. He  walked through many streets, but could not find her he sought. At last,  fairly worn out, he went to a hostelry and slept till daybreak. All that  day, heavy and heartsick, he sought her, but could never fall in with  her or her father, nor ever obtain the slightest clue. Then he felt she  was false or had changed her mind. He was irritated now, as well as sad.  More good fortune fell on him; he almost hated it. At last, on the third  day, after he had once more been through every street, he said, \"She is  not in the town, and I shall never see her again. I will go home.\"  He started for Tergou with royal favour promised, with fifteen golden  angels in his purse, a golden medal on his bosom, and a heart like a  lump of lead.        CHAPTER IV    It was near four o'clock in the afternoon. Eli was in the shop. His  eldest and youngest sons were abroad. Catherine and her little crippled  daughter had long been anxious about Gerard, and now they were gone a  little way down the road, to see if by good luck he might be visible  in the distance; and Giles was alone in the sitting-room, which I will  sketch, furniture and dwarf included.    The Hollanders were always an original and leading people. They claim  to have invented printing (wooden type), oil-painting, liberty,  banking, gardening, etc. Above all, years before my tale, they invented  cleanliness. So, while the English gentry, in velvet jerkins and  chicken-toed shoes, trode floors of stale rushes, foul receptacle of  bones, decomposing morsels, spittle, dogs, eggs, and all abominations,  this hosier's sitting-room at Tergou was floored with Dutch tiles, so  highly glazed and constantly washed, that you could eat off them. There  was one large window; the cross stone-work in the centre of it was  very massive, and stood in relief, looking like an actual cross to the  inmates, and was eyed as such in their devotions. The panes were very  small and lozenge-shaped, and soldered to one another with strips of  lead: the like you may see to this day in our rural cottages. The chairs  were rude and primitive, all but the arm-chair, whose back, at right  angles with its seat, was so high that the sitter's head stopped two  feet short of the top. This chair was of oak, and carved at the summit.  There was a copper pail, that went in at the waist, holding holy water,  and a little hand-besom to sprinkle it far and wide; and a long, narrow,  but massive oak table, and a dwarf sticking to its rim by his teeth, his  eyes glaring, and his claws in the air like a pouncing vampire. Nature,  it would seem, did not make Giles a dwarf out of malice prepense; she  constructed a head and torso with her usual care; but just then her  attention was distracted, and she left the rest to chance; the result  was a human wedge, an inverted cone. He might justly have taken her to  task in the terms of Horace,         \"Amphora coepit       Institui; currente rota cur urceus exit?\"    His centre was anything but his centre of gravity. Bisected, upper Giles  would have outweighed three lower Giles. But this very disproportion  enabled him to do feats that would have baffled Milo. His brawny arms  had no weight to draw after them; so he could go up a vertical pole like  a squirrel, and hang for hours from a bough by one hand like a cherry by  its stalk. If he could have made a vacuum with his hands, as the lizard  is said to do with its feet, he would have gone along a ceiling. Now,  this pocket-athlete was insanely fond of gripping the dinner-table with  both hands, and so swinging; and then--climax of delight! he would seize  it with his teeth, and, taking off his hands, hold on like grim death by  his huge ivories.    But all our joys, however elevating, suffer interruption. Little Kate  caught Sampsonet in this posture, and stood aghast. She was her mother's  daughter, and her heart was with the furniture, not with the 12mo  gymnast.    \"Oh, Giles! how can you? Mother is at hand. It dents the table.\"    \"Go and tell her, little tale-bearer,\" snarled Giles. \"You are the one  for making mischief.\"    \"Am I?\" inquired Kate calmly; \"that is news to me.\"    \"The biggest in Tergou,\" growled Giles, fastening on again.    \"Oh, indeed!\" said Kate drily.    This piece of unwonted satire launched, and Giles not visibly blasted,  she sat down quietly and cried.    Her mother came in almost at that moment, and Giles hurled himself under  the table, and there glared.    \"What is to do now?\" said the dame sharply. Then turning her experienced  eyes from Kate to Giles, and observing the position he had taken up, and  a sheepish expression, she hinted at cuffing of ears.    \"Nay, mother,\" said the girl; \"it was but a foolish word Giles spoke.  I had not noticed it at another time; but I was tired and in care for  Gerard, you know.\"    \"Let no one be in care for me,\" said a faint voice at the door, and in  tottered Gerard, pale, dusty, and worn out; and amidst uplifted hands  and cries of delight, curiosity, and anxiety mingled, dropped exhausted  into the nearest chair.    Beating Rotterdam, like a covert, for Margaret, and the long journey  afterwards, had fairly knocked Gerard up. But elastic youth soon  revived, and behold him the centre of an eager circle. First of all they  must hear about the prizes. Then Gerard told them he had been admitted  to see the competitors' works, all laid out in an enormous hall before  the judges pronounced.    \"Oh, mother! oh, Kate! when I saw the goldsmiths' work, I had liked to  have fallen on the floor. I thought not all the goldsmiths on earth had  so much gold, silver, jewels, and craft of design and facture. But, in  sooth, all the arts are divine.\"    Then, to please the females, he described to them the reliquaries,  feretories, calices,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#8)"],[1,"epidemic. The sepoys had suffered  chiefly, but not exclusively, for the British ranks also supplied a quota  of victims. An officer on the staff of the military governor of Baghdad  had recently died. We heard that the army commander had the virulent form,  and knew there could be no chance of his recovery. The announcement of his  death was a heavy blow to all, and many were the gloomy forebodings. The  whole army had implicit confidence in their leader, and deeply mourned his  loss. The usual rumors of foul play and poison went the rounds, but I  soon after heard Colonel Wilcox--in pre-war days an able and renowned  practitioner of Harley Street--say that it was an undoubted case of  cholera. The colonel had attended General Maude throughout the illness.  The general had never taken the cholera prophylactic, although Colonel  Wilcox had on many occasions urged him to do so, the last time being only  a few days before the disease developed.    [Illustration: Towing an armored car across a river]    [Illustration: Reconnaissance]    General Marshall, who had commanded General Maude's old division, the  Thirteenth, took over. The Seventeenth lost General Gillman, who thereupon  became chief of staff. This was a great loss to his division, for he was  the idol of the men, but the interest of the Expeditionary Force was  naturally and justly given precedence.    In due course my transfer to the Motor Machine-Gun Corps came through  approved, and I was assigned to the Fourteenth battery of light-armored  motor-cars, commanded by Captain Nigel Somerset, whose grandfather, Lord  Raglan, had died, nursed by Florence Nightingale, while in command of the  British forces in the Crimean War. Somerset himself was in the infantry at  the outbreak of the war and had been twice wounded in France. He was an  excellent leader, possessing as he did dash, judgment, and personal  magnetism. A battery was composed of eight armored cars, subdivided into  four sections. There was a continually varying number of tenders and  workshop lorries. The fighting cars were Rolls-Royces, the others Napiers  and Fords.    At that time there were only four batteries in the country. We were army  troops--that is to say, we were not attached to any individual brigade, or  division, or corps, but were temporarily assigned first here and then  there, as the need arose.    In attacks we worked in co-operation with the cavalry. Although on  occasions they tried to use us as tanks, it was not successful, for our  armor-plate was too light. We were also employed in raiding, and in  quelling Arab uprisings. This latter use threw us into close touch with  the political officers. These were a most interesting lot of men. They  were recruited in part from the army, but largely from civil life. They  took over the civil administration of the conquered territory and  judiciously upheld native justice. Many remarkable characters were  numbered among them--men who had devoted a lifetime to the study of the  intricacies of Oriental diplomacy. They were distinguished by the white  tabs on the collars of their regulation uniforms; but white was by no  means invariably the sign of peace, for many of the political officers  were killed, and more than once in isolated towns in unsettled districts  they sustained sieges that lasted for several days. We often took a  political officer out with us on a raid or reconnaissance, finding his  knowledge of the language and customs of great assistance. Sir Percy Cox  was at the head, with the title \"Chief Political Officer\" and the rank of  general. His career in the Persian Gulf has been as distinguished as it is  long, and his handling of the very delicate situations arising in  Mesopotamia has called forth the unstinted praise of soldier and civilian  alike.    Ably assisting him, and head of the Arab bureau, was Miss Gertrude Bell,  the only woman, other than the nursing sisters, officially connected with  the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Forces. Miss Bell speaks Arabic fluently  and correctly. She first became interested in the East when visiting her  uncle at Teheran, where he was British minister. She has made noteworthy  expeditions in Syria and Mesopotamia, and has written a number of  admirable books, among which are _Armurath to Armurath_ and _The Desert  and the Sown_. The undeniable position which she holds must appear doubly  remarkable when the Mohammedan official attitude toward women is borne in  mind. Miss Bell has worked steadily and without a leave in this trying  climate, and her tact and judgment have contributed to the British success  to a degree that can scarcely be overestimated.    The headquarters of the various batteries were in Baghdad. There we had  our permanent billets, and stores. We would often be ordered out in  sections to be away varying lengths of time, though rarely more than a  couple of months. The workshops' officer stayed in permanent charge and  had the difficult task of keeping all the cars in repair. The supply of  spare parts was so uncertain that much skill and ingenuity were called  for, and possessed to a full degree by Lieutenant Linnell of the  Fourteenth.    A few days after I joined I set off with Somerset and one of the battery  officers, Lieutenant Smith, formerly of the Black Watch. We were ordered  to do some patrolling near the ruins of Babylon. Kerbela and Nejef, in the  quality of great Shiah shrines, had never been particularly friendly to  the Turks, who were Sunnis--but the desert tribes are almost invariably  Sunnis, and this coupled with their natural instinct for raiding and  plundering made them eager to take advantage of any interregnum of  authority. We organized a sort of native mounted police, but they were  more picturesque than effective. They were armed with weapons of varying  age and origin--not one was more recent than the middle of the last  century. Now the Budus, the wild desert folk, were frequently equipped  with rifles they had stolen from us, so in a contest the odds were  anything but even.    We took up our quarters at Museyib, a small town on the banks of the  Euphrates, six or eight miles above the Hindiyah Barrage, a dam finished a  few years before, and designed to irrigate a large tract of potentially  rich country. We patrolled out to Mohamediyah, a village on the caravan  desert route to Baghdad, and thence down to Hilleh, around which stand the  ruins of ancient Babylon. The rainy season was just beginning, and it was  obvious that the patrolling could not be continuous, for a twelve-hour  rain would make the country impassable to our heavy cars for two or three  days. We were fortunate in having pleasant company in the officers of a  Punjabi infantry battalion and an Indian cavalry regiment. Having  commandeered an ancient caravan-serai for garage and billets, we set to  work to clean it out and make it as waterproof as circumstances would  permit. An oil-drum with a length of iron telegraph-pole stuck in its top  provided a serviceable stove, and when it rained we played bridge or read.    I was ever ready to reduce my kit to any extent in order to have space for  some books, and Voltaire's _Charles XII_ was the first called upon to  carry me to another part of the world from that in which I at the moment  found myself. I always kept a volume of some sort in my pocket, and during  halts I would read in the shade cast by the turret of my car. The two  volumes of Layard's _Early Adventures_ proved a great success. The writer,  the great Assyriologist, is better known as the author of _Nineveh and  Babylon_. The book I was reading had been written when he was in his early  twenties, but published for the first time forty years later. Layard  started life as a solicitor's clerk in London, but upon being offered a  post in India he had accepted and proceeded thither overland. On reaching  Baghdad he made a side-trip into Kurdistan, and became so enamored of the  life of the tribesmen that he lived there with them on and off for two  years--years filled with adventure of the most thrilling sort.    I had finished a translation of Xenophon shortly before and found it a  very different book than when I was plodding drearily through it in the  original at school. Here it was all vivid and real before my eyes, with  the scene of the great battle of Cunaxa only a few miles from Museyib.  Babylon was in sight of the valiant Greeks, but all through the loss of a  leader it was never to be theirs. On the ground itself one could  appreciate how great a masterpiece the retreat really was, and the  hardiness of the soldiers which caused Xenophon to regard as a \"snow  sickness\" the starvation and utter weariness which made the numbed men lie  down and die in the snow of the Anatolian highlands. He remarks naively  that if you could build a fire and give them something hot to eat, the  sickness was dispelled!    The rain continued to fall and the mud became deeper and deeper. It was  all the Arabs could do to get their produce into market. The bazaar was  not large, but was always thronged. I used to sit in one of the  coffee-houses and drink coffee or tea and smoke the long-stemmed  water-pipe, the narghile. My Arabic was now sufficiently fluent for  ordinary conversation, and in these clubs of the Arab I could hear all the  gossip. Bazaar rumors always told of our advances long before they were  officially given out. Once in Baghdad I heard of an attack we had  launched. On going around to G.H.Q. I mentioned the rumor, and found that  it was not yet known there, but shortly after was confirmed. I had already  in Africa met with the \"native wireless,\" and it will be remembered how in  the Civil War the plantation negroes were often the first to get news of  the battles. It is something that I have never heard satisfactorily  explained.    In the coffee-houses, besides smoking and gossiping, we also played games,  either chess or backgammon or"]]]
