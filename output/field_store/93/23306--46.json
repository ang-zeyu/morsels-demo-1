The construction of these little artificial islands however  had not been simple.    [Illustration: THE YOUNG NILE.]    A single man or a single family or even a small tribe could not  construct a river-dam without the help of others.    However much a farmer might dislike his neighbors he disliked getting  drowned even more and he was obliged to call upon the entire  country-side when the water of the river began to rise and threatened  him and his wife and his children and his cattle with destruction.    Necessity forced the people to forget their small differences and soon  the entire valley of the Nile was covered with little combinations of  people who constantly worked together for a common purpose and who  depended upon each other for life and prosperity.    Out of such small beginnings grew the first powerful State.    It was a great step forward along the road of progress.    It made the land of Egypt a truly inhabitable place. It meant the end of  lawless murder. It assured the people greater safety than ever before  and gave the weaker members of the tribe a chance to survive. Nowadays,  when conditions of absolute disorder exist only in the jungles of  Africa, it is hard to imagine a world without laws and policemen and  judges and health officers and hospitals and schools.    But five thousand years ago, Egypt stood alone as an organized state and  was greatly envied by those of her neighbors who were obliged to face  the difficulties of life single-handedly.    A state, however, is not only composed of citizens.    There must be a few men who execute the laws and who, in case of an  emergency, take command of the entire community. Therefore no country  has ever been able to endure without a single head, be he called a King  or an Emperor or a Shah (as in Persia) or a President, as he is called  in our own land.    [Illustration: THE FERTILE VALLEY.]    In ancient Egypt, every village recognized the authority of the  Village-Elders, who were old men and possessed greater experience than  the young ones. These Elders selected a strong man to command their  soldiers in case of war and to tell them what to do when there was a  flood. They gave him a title which distinguished him from the others.  They called him a King or a prince and obeyed his orders for their own  common benefit.    Therefore in the oldest days of Egyptian history, we find the following  division among the people:    The majority are peasants.    All of them are equally rich and equally poor.    They are ruled by a powerful man who is the commander-in-chief of their  armies and who appoints their judges and causes roads to be built for  the common benefit and comfort.    He also is the chief of the police force and catches the thieves.    In return for these valuable services he receives a certain amount of  everybody's money which is called a tax. The greater part of these  taxes, however, do not belong to the King personally. They are money  entrusted to him to be used for the common good.    But after a short while a new class of people, neither peasants nor  king, begins to develop. This new class, commonly called the nobles,  stands between the ruler and his subjects.    Since those early days it has made its appearance in the history of  every country and it has played a great role in the development of  every nation.    I must try and explain to you how this class of nobles developed out of  the most commonplace circumstances of everyday life and why it has  maintained itself to this very day, against every form of opposition.    To make my story quite clear, I have drawn a picture.    It shows you five Egyptian farms. The original owners of these farms had  moved into Egypt years and years ago. Each had taken a piece of  unoccupied land and had settled down upon it to raise grain and cows and  pigs and do whatever was necessary to keep themselves and their children  alive. Apparently they had the same chance in life.    How then did it happen that one became the ruler of his neighbors and  got hold of all their fields and barns without breaking a single law?    [Illustration: THE ORIGINS OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.]    One day after the harvest, Mr. Fish (you see his name in hieroglyphics  on the map) sent his boat loaded with grain to the town of Memphis to  sell the cargo to the inhabitants of central Egypt. It happened to have  been a good year for the farmer and Fish got a great deal of money for  his wheat. After ten days the boat returned to the homestead and the  captain handed the money which he had received to his employer.    A few weeks later, Mr. Sparrow, whose farm was next to that of Fish,  sent his wheat to the nearest market. Poor Sparrow had not been very  lucky for the last few years. But he hoped to make up for his recent  losses by a profitable sale of his grain. Therefore he had waited until  the price of wheat in Memphis should have gone a little higher.    That morning a rumor had reached the village of a famine in the island  of Crete. As a result the grain in the Egyptian markets had greatly  increased in value.    Sparrow hoped to profit through this unexpected turn of the market and  he bade his skipper to hurry.    The skipper handled the rudder of his craft so clumsily that the boat  struck a rock and sank, drowning the mate who was caught under the sail.    Sparrow not only lost all his grain and his ship but he was also forced  to pay the widow of his drowned mate ten pieces of gold to make up for  the loss of her husband.    These disasters occurred at the very moment when Sparrow could not  afford another loss.    Winter was near and he had no money to buy cloaks for his children. He  had put off buying new hoes and spades for such a long time that the old  ones were completely worn out. He had no seeds for his fields. He was in  a desperate plight.    He did not like his neighbor, Mr. Fish, any too well but there was no  way out. He must go and humbly he must ask for the loan of a small  sum of money.    He called on Fish. The latter said that he would gladly let him have  whatever he needed but could Sparrow put up any sort of guaranty?    Sparrow said, \"Yes.\" He would offer his own farm as a pledge of good  faith.    Unfortunately Fish knew all about that farm. It had belonged to the  Sparrow family for many generations. But the Father of the present owner  had allowed himself to be terribly cheated by a Phoenician trader who  had sold him a couple of \"Phrygian Oxen\" (nobody knew what the name  meant) which were said to be of a very fine breed, which needed little  food and performed twice as much labor as the common Egyptian oxen. The  old farmer had believed the solemn words of the impostor. He had bought  the wonderful beasts, greatly envied by all his neighbors.    They had not proved a success.    They were very stupid and very slow and exceedingly lazy and within  three weeks they had died from a mysterious disease.    The old farmer was so angry that he suffered a stroke and the management  of his estate was left to the son, who worked hard but without  much result.    The loss of his grain and his vessel were the last straw.    Young Sparrow must either starve or ask his neighbor to help him with a  loan.    Fish who was familiar with the lives of all his neighbors (he was that  kind of person, not because he loved gossip but one never knew how such  information might come in handy) and who knew to a penny the state of  affairs in the Sparrow household, felt strong enough to insist upon  certain terms. Sparrow could have all the money he needed upon the  following condition. He must promise to work for Fish six weeks of every  year and he must allow him free access to his grounds at all times.    Sparrow did not like these terms, but the days were growing shorter and  winter was coming on fast and his family were without food.    He was forced to accept and from that time on, he and his sons and  daughters were no longer quite as free as they had been before.    They did not exactly become the servants or the slaves of their  neighbor, but they were dependent upon his kindness for their own  livelihood. When they met Fish in the road they stepped aside and said  \"Good morning, sir.\" And he answered them--or not--as the case might be.    He now owned a great deal of water-front, twice as much as before.    He had more land and more laborers and he could raise more grain than in  the past years. The nearby villagers talked of the new house he was  building and in a general way, he was regarded as a man of growing  wealth and importance.    Late that summer an unheard-of-thing happened.    It rained.    The oldest inhabitants could not remember such a thing, but it rained  hard and steadily for two whole days. A little brook, the existence of  which everybody had forgotten, was suddenly turned into a wild torrent.  In the middle of the night it came thundering down from the mountains  and destroyed the harvest of the farmer who occupied the rocky ground at  the foot of the hills. His name was Cup and he too had inherited his  land from a hundred other Cups who had gone before. The damage was  almost irreparable. Cup needed new seed grain and he needed it at once.  He had heard Sparrow's story. He too hated to ask a favor of Fish who  was known far and wide as a shrewd dealer. But in the end, he found his  way to the Fishs' homestead and humbly begged for the loan of a few  bushels of wheat. He got them but not until he had agreed to work two  whole months of each year on the farm of Fish.    Fish was now doing very well. His new house was ready and he thought the  time had come to establish himself as the head of a household.    Just across the way, there lived a farmer who had a young daughter. The  name of this farmer "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#8)"],[1,"not sitting in  the chair, but had fallen out, and was lying upon the floor,  face downward.    Very gently, I turned her over, and raised her head somewhat. Then, I  poured a little of the brandy between her lips. After a while, she  shivered slightly. A little later, she gave several gasps, and opened  her eyes. In a dreamy, unrealizing way, she looked at me. Then her eyes  closed, slowly, and I gave her a little more of the brandy. For, perhaps  a minute longer, she lay silent, breathing quickly. All at once, her  eyes opened again, and it seemed to me, as I looked, that the pupils  were dilated, as though fear had come with returning consciousness.  Then, with a movement so unexpected that I started backward, she sat up.  Noticing that she seemed giddy, I put out my hand to steady her. At  that, she gave a loud scream, and, scrambling to her feet, ran from  the room.    For a moment, I stayed there--kneeling and holding the brandy flask. I  was utterly puzzled and astonished.    Could she be afraid of me? But no! Why should she? I could only  conclude that her nerves were badly shaken, and that she was temporarily  unhinged. Upstairs, I heard a door bang, loudly, and I knew that she had  taken refuge in her room. I put the flask down on the table. My  attention was distracted by a noise in the direction of the back door. I  went toward it, and listened. It appeared to be shaken, as though some  of the creatures struggled with it, silently; but it was far too  strongly constructed and hung to be easily moved.    Out in the gardens rose a continuous sound. It might have been  mistaken, by a casual listener, for the grunting and squealing of a herd  of pigs. But, as I stood there, it came to me that there was sense and  meaning to all those swinish noises. Gradually, I seemed able to trace  a semblance in it to human speech--glutinous and sticky, as though each  articulation were made with difficulty: yet, nevertheless, I was  becoming convinced that it was no mere medley of sounds; but a rapid  interchange of ideas.    By this time, it had grown quite dark in the passages, and from these  came all the varied cries and groans of which an old house is so full  after nightfall. It is, no doubt, because things are then quieter, and  one has more leisure to hear. Also, there may be something in the theory  that the sudden change of temperature, at sundown, affects the structure  of the house, somewhat--causing it to contract and settle, as it were,  for the night. However, this is as may be; but, on that night in  particular, I would gladly have been quit of so many eerie noises. It  seemed to me, that each crack and creak was the coming of one of those  Things along the dark corridors; though I knew in my heart that this  could not be, for I had seen, myself, that all the doors were secure.    Gradually, however, these sounds grew on my nerves to such an extent  that, were it only to punish my cowardice, I felt I must make the 'round  of the basement again, and, if anything were there, face it. And then, I  would go up to my study, for I knew sleep was out of the question, with  the house surrounded by creatures, half beasts, half something else, and  entirely unholy.    Taking the kitchen lamp down from its hook, I made my way from cellar  to cellar, and room to room; through pantry and coal-hole--along  passages, and into the hundred-and-one little blind alleys and hidden  nooks that form the basement of the old house. Then, when I knew I had  been in every corner and cranny large enough to conceal aught of any  size, I made my way to the stairs.    With my foot on the first step, I paused. It seemed to me, I heard a  movement, apparently from the buttery, which is to the left of the  staircase. It had been one of the first places I searched, and yet, I  felt certain my ears had not deceived me. My nerves were strung now,  and, with hardly any hesitation, I stepped up to the door, holding the  lamp above my head. In a glance, I saw that the place was empty, save  for the heavy, stone slabs, supported by brick pillars; and I was about  to leave it, convinced that I had been mistaken; when, in turning, my  light was flashed back from two bright spots outside the window, and  high up. For a few moments, I stood there, staring. Then they  moved--revolving slowly, and throwing out alternate scintillations of  green and red; at least, so it appeared to me. I knew then that they  were eyes.    Slowly, I traced the shadowy outline of one of the Things. It appeared  to be holding on to the bars of the window, and its attitude suggested  climbing. I went nearer to the window, and held the light higher. There  was no need to be afraid of the creature; the bars were strong, and  there was little danger of its being able to move them. And then,  suddenly, in spite of the knowledge that the brute could not reach to  harm me, I had a return of the horrible sensation of fear, that had  assailed me on that night, a week previously. It was the same feeling of  helpless, shuddering fright. I realized, dimly, that the creature's eyes  were looking into mine with a steady, compelling stare. I tried to turn  away; but could not. I seemed, now, to see the window through a mist.  Then, I thought other eyes came and peered, and yet others; until a  whole galaxy of malignant, staring orbs seemed to hold me in thrall.    My head began to swim, and throb violently. Then, I was aware of a  feeling of acute physical pain in my left hand. It grew more severe, and  forced, literally forced, my attention. With a tremendous effort, I  glanced down; and, with that, the spell that had held me was broken. I  realized, then, that I had, in my agitation, unconsciously caught hold  of the hot lamp-glass, and burnt my hand, badly. I looked up to the  window, again. The misty appearance had gone, and, now, I saw that it  was crowded with dozens of bestial faces. With a sudden access of rage,  I raised the lamp, and hurled it, full at the window. It struck the  glass (smashing a pane), and passed between two of the bars, out into  the garden, scattering burning oil as it went. I heard several loud  cries of pain, and, as my sight became accustomed to the dark, I  discovered that the creatures had left the window.    Pulling myself together, I groped for the door, and, having found it,  made my way upstairs, stumbling at each step. I felt dazed, as though I  had received a blow on the head. At the same time, my hand smarted  badly, and I was full of a nervous, dull rage against those Things.    Reaching my study, I lit the candles. As they burnt up, their rays were  reflected from the rack of firearms on the sidewall. At the sight, I  remembered that I had there a power, which, as I had proved earlier,  seemed as fatal to those monsters as to more ordinary animals; and I  determined I would take the offensive.    First of all, I bound up my hand; for the pain was fast becoming  intolerable. After that, it seemed easier, and I crossed the room, to  the rifle stand. There, I selected a heavy rifle--an old and tried  weapon; and, having procured ammunition, I made my way up into one of  the small towers, with which the house is crowned.    From there, I found that I could see nothing. The gardens presented a  dim blur of shadows--a little blacker, perhaps, where the trees stood.  That was all, and I knew that it was useless to shoot down into all that  darkness. The only thing to be done, was to wait for the moon to rise;  then, I might be able to do a little execution.    In the meantime, I sat still, and kept my ears open. The gardens were  comparatively quiet now, and only an occasional grunt or squeal came up  to me. I did not like this silence; it made me wonder on what devilry  the creatures were bent. Twice, I left the tower, and took a walk  through the house; but everything was silent.    Once, I heard a noise, from the direction of the Pit, as though more  earth had fallen. Following this, and lasting for some fifteen minutes,  there was a commotion among the denizens of the gardens. This died away,  and, after that all was again quiet.    About an hour later, the moon's light showed above the distant horizon.  From where I sat, I could see it over the trees; but it was not until it  rose clear of them, that I could make out any of the details in the  gardens below. Even then, I could see none of the brutes; until,  happening to crane forward, I saw several of them lying prone, up  against the wall of the house. What they were doing, I could not make  out. It was, however, a chance too good to be ignored; and, taking aim,  I fired at the one directly beneath. There was a shrill scream, and, as  the smoke cleared away, I saw that it had turned on its back, and was  writhing, feebly. Then, it was quiet. The others had disappeared.    Immediately after this, I heard a loud squeal, in the direction of the  Pit. It was answered, a hundred times, from every part of the garden.  This gave me some notion of the number of the creatures, and I began to  feel that the whole affair was becoming even more serious than I  had imagined.    As I sat there, silent and watchful, the thought came to me--Why was  all this? What were these Things? What did it mean? Then my thoughts  flew back to that vision (though, even now, I doubt whether it was a  vision) of the Plain of Silence. What did that mean? I wondered--And  that Thing in the arena? Ugh! Lastly, I thought of the house I had seen  in that far-away place. That house, so like this in every detail of  external structure, that it might have been modeled from it; or this  from that. I had never thought of that--    At this moment, there came another long squeal, from the Pit, followed,  a second later, by a couple of shorter ones. At once, the garden was  filled with answering cries. I stood up, quickly, and looked over the  parapet. In the moonlight, it seemed as though the shrubberies were  alive. They"]]]
