In the  main it has consisted of the teacher assigning to the pupils a certain  number of paragraphs or pages in the textbook as the next lesson, and  then questioning them next day to ascertain how much of this printed  material they have remembered and how well. It has not consisted  of stimulating and guiding the children toward intelligent  inquisitiveness and inquiring interest as to the world, and the skies  above, and waters round about, and the conditions of nature that limit  and shape the development of mankind.    That the latter is the proper end of geographical teaching is being  recognized in developing the new course of study in this subject.  Industries, commerce, agriculture, and modes of living are becoming  the centers about which geographic thought and experience are  gathered. The best work now being done here is thoroughly modern.  Unfortunately it is not yet great in amount in even the best of the  schools, still less in the majority. But the direction of progress is  unmistakable and unquestionably correct.    As in the reading, so in geography, right development of the course of  study must depend in large measure upon the material equipment that is  at the same time provided. It sounds like a legitimate evasion to  say that education is a spiritual process, and that good teachers  and willing, obedient, and industrious pupils are about all that is  required. As a matter of fact, just as modern business has found it  necessary to install one-hundred-dollar typewriters to take the place  of the penny quill pens, so must education, to be efficient, develop  and employ the elaborate tools needed by new and complex modern  conditions, and set aside the tools that were adequate in a simpler  age. The proper teaching of geography requires an abundance of reading  materials of the type that will permit pupils to enter vividly into  the varied experience of all classes of people in all parts of the  world. In the supplementary books now furnished the schools, only  a beginning has been made. The schools need 10 times as much  geographical reading as that now found in the best equipped school.    It would be well to drop the term \"supplementary.\" This reading should  be the basic geographic experience, the fundamental instrument of  the teaching. All else is supplementary. The textbook then becomes  a reference book of maps, charts, summaries, and a treatment for  the sake of perspective. Maps, globes, pictures, stereoscopes,  stereopticon, moving-picture machine, models, diagrams, and museum  materials, are all for the purpose of developing ideas and imagery of  details. The reading should become and remain fundamental and central.  The quantity required is so great as to make it necessary for the city  to furnish the books. While the various other things enumerated are  necessary for complete effectiveness, many of them could well wait  until the reading materials are sufficiently supplied.    In the high schools the clear tendency is to introduce more of the  industrial and commercial geography and to diminish the time given to  the less valuable physiography. The development is not yet vigorous.  The high school geography departments, so far as observed, have not  yet altogether attained the social point of view. But they are moving  in that direction. On the one hand, they now need stimulation; and  on the other, to be supplied with the more advanced kinds of such  material equipment as already suggested for the elementary schools.          DRAWING AND APPLIED ART      The elementary schools are giving the usual proportion of time to  drawing and applied art. The time is distributed, however, in a  somewhat unusual, but probably justifiable, manner. Whereas the  subject usually receives more time in the primary grades than in the  grammar grades, in Cleveland, in quite the reverse way, the subject  receives its greatest emphasis in the higher grades.      TABLE 10.--TIME GIVEN TO DRAWING    ===========================================================               |    Hours per year    | Per cent of grade time|       Grade   |-----------------------------------------------               | Cleveland | 50 cities| Cleveland | 50 cities |    -----------------------------------------------------------        1      |    47     |    98    |     6.5   |   11.3    |        2      |    47     |    54    |     5.3   |    6.0    |        3      |    47     |    56    |     5.3   |    6.2    |        4      |    47     |    53    |     5.3   |    5.5    |        5      |    57     |    50    |     6.4   |    5.2    |        6      |    57     |    50    |     6.4   |    5.1    |        7      |    57     |    50    |     6.4   |    5.0    |        8      |    57     |    49    |     6.4   |    4.9    |    ===========================================================      Total    |   416     |   460    |     6.1   |    6.1    |    -----------------------------------------------------------    Drawing has been taught in Cleveland as a regular portion of the  curriculum since 1849. It has therefore had time for substantial  growth; and it appears to have been successful. Recent developments  in the main have been wholesome and in line with best modern progress.  The course throughout attempts to develop an understanding and  appreciation of the principles of graphic art plus ability to use  these principles through practical application in constructive  activities of an endlessly varied sort.    Occasionally the work appears falsetto and even sentimental. It  is often applied in artificial schoolroom ways to things without  significance. General grade teachers cannot be specialists in  the multiplicity of things demanded of them; it is not therefore  surprising that they sometimes lack skill, insight, ingenuity, and  resourcefulness. Too often the teachers do not realize that the study  of drawing and design is for the serious purpose of giving to pupils a  language and form of thought of the greatest practical significance  in our present age. The result is a not infrequent use of schoolroom  exercises that do not greatly aid the pupils as they enter the busy  world of practical affairs.    These shortcomings indicate incompleteness in the development. Where  the teaching is at its best in both the elementary and high schools  of Cleveland, the work exhibits balanced understanding and complete  modernness. The thing needed is further expansion of the best, and the  extension of this type of work through specially trained departmental  teachers to all parts of the city.    There should be a larger amount of active co-operation between the  teachers of art and design and the teachers of manual training; also  between both sets of teachers and the general community.          MANUAL TRAINING AND HOUSEHOLD ARTS      In the grammar grades manual and household training receives an  average proportion of the time. In the grades before the seventh, the  subject receives considerably less than the usual amount of time.

They assist in the training for complicated vocational  activities performed in some degree at least by most women. Where  women are so situated that they do not actually perform them, they  need, for properly supervising others and for making intelligible and  appreciative use of the labors of others, a considerable understanding  of these various matters.    Where this work for girls is at its best in Cleveland, it appears to  be of a superior character. Those who are in charge of the best are in  a position to advise as to further extensions and developments. It  is not difficult to discern certain of these. It would appear, for  example, that sewing should find some place at least in the work of  seventh and eighth grades. The girl who does not go on to high school  is greatly in need of more advanced training in sewing than can be  given in the sixth grade. Each building having a household arts  room should possess a sewing machine or two, at the very least. The  academic high schools are now planning to offer courses in domestic  science. As in the technical high schools, all of this work should  involve as large a degree of normal responsibility as possible.    We omit discussion here of the specialized vocational training of  women, since this is handled in other reports of the Survey.    When we turn to the manual training of the boys, we are confronted  with problems of much greater difficulty. Women's household  occupations, so far as retained in the home, are unspecialized. Each  well-trained household worker does or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#8)"],[1,"great was my life-days' gain;    Now these shards have been my fellow in the work the Gods would have,    But today hath Odin taken the gift that once he gave.    I have wrought for the Volsungs truly, and yet have I known full well    That a better one than I am shall bear the tale to tell:    And for him shall these shards be smithied; and he shall be my son    To remember what I have forgotten and to do what I left undone.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then failed the voice of Sigmund; but so mighty was the man,    That a long while yet he lingered till the dusky night grew wan,    And she sat and sorrowed o'er him, but no more a word he spake.    Then a long way over the sea-flood the day began to break;    And when the sun was arisen a little he turned his head    Till the low beams bathed his eyen, and there lay Sigmund dead.    And the sun rose up on the earth; but where was the Volsung kin    And the folk that the Gods had begotten the praise of all people to win?      _How King Sigmund the Volsung was laid in mound on the sea-side  of the Isle-realm._      Now Hiordis looked from the dead, and her eyes strayed down to the sea,    And a shielded ship she saw, and a war-dight company,    Who beached the ship for the landing: so swift she fled away,    And once more to the depth of the thicket, wherein her handmaid lay:    And she said: \"I have left my lord, and my lord is dead and gone,    And he gave me a charge full heavy, and here are we twain alone,    And earls from the sea are landing: give me thy blue attire,    And take my purple and gold and my crown of the sea-flood's fire,    And be thou the wife of King Volsung when men of our names shall ask,    And I will be the handmaid: now I bid thee to this task,    And I pray thee not to fail me, because of thy faith and truth,    And because I have ever loved thee, and thy mother fostered my youth.\"           *       *       *       *       *      So the other nought gainsaith it and they shift their raiment there:    But well-spoken was the maiden, and a woman tall and fair.      Now the lord of those new-coming men was a king and the son of a king,    King Elf the son of the Helper, and he sailed from warfaring    And drew anigh to the Isle-realm and sailed along the strand;    For the shipmen needed water and fain would go a-land;    And King Elf stood hard by the tiller while the world was yet a-cold:    Then the red sun lit the dawning, and they looked, and lo, behold!    The wrack of a mighty battle, and heaps of the shielded dead,    And a woman alive amidst them, a queen with crowned head,    And her eyes strayed down to the sea-strand, and she saw that weaponed folk,    And turned and fled to the thicket: then the lord of the shipmen spoke:    \"Lo, here shall we lack for water, for the brooks with blood shall run,    Yet wend we ashore to behold it and to wot of the deeds late done.\"      So they turned their faces to Sigmund, and waded the swathes of the sword.    \"O, look ye long,\" said the Sea-king, \"for here lieth a mighty lord:    And all these are the deeds of his war-flame, yet hardy hearts, be sure,    That they once durst look in his face or the wrath of his eyen endure;    Though his lips be glad and smiling as a God that dreameth of mirth.    Would God I were one of his kindred, for none such are left upon earth.    Now fare we into the thicket, for thereto is the woman fled,    And belike she shall tell us the story of this field of the mighty dead.\"      So they wend and find the women, and bespeak them kind and fair:    Then spake the gold-crowned handmaid: \"Of the Isle-king's house we were,    And I am the Queen called Hiordis; and the man that lies on the field    Was mine own lord Sigmund the Volsung, the mightiest under shield.\"      Then all amazed were the sea-folk when they hearkened to that word,    And great and heavy tidings they deem their ears have heard:    But again spake out the Sea-king: \"And this blue-clad one beside,    So pale, and as tall as a Goddess, and white and lovely eyed?\"      \"In sooth and in troth,\" said the woman, \"my serving-maid is this;    She hath wept long over the battle, and sore afraid she is.\"      Now the king looks hard upon her, but he saith no word thereto,    And down again to the death-field with the women-folk they go.    There they set their hands to the labour, and amidst the deadly mead    They raise a mound for Sigmund, a mighty house indeed;    And therein they set that folk-king, and goodly was his throne,    And dight with gold and scarlet: and the walls of the house were done    With the cloven shields of the foemen, and banners borne to field;    But none might find his war-helm or the splinters of his shield,    And clenched and fast was his right hand, but no sword therein he had:    For Hiordis spake to the shipmen:                                     \"Our lord and master bade    That the shards of his glaive of battle should go with our lady the Queen:    And by them that lie a-dying a many things are seen.\"      _How Queen Hiordis is known; and how she abideth in the house of  Elf the son of the Helper._    Then Elf asked of the two women where they would go, and they prayed  that he would take them to his land, where they dwelt for long in all  honour.    But the old queen, the mother of Elf, was indeed a woman wise above  many, and fain would she know why the less noble of the two was  dressed the more richly and why the handmaid gave always wiser  counsel than her mistress. So she bade her son to speak suddenly and  to take them unawares.    Then he asked the gold-clad one how she knew in the dark winter night  that the dawn was near. She answered that ever in her youth she awoke  at the dawn to follow her daily work, and always was she wont to  drink of whey, and now, though the times were changed, she still woke  athirst near the dawning.    To Elf it seemed strange that a fair queen in her youth had need to  arise to follow the plough in the dark of the winter morning, and  turning to the handmaid he asked of her the same question. She  replied that in her youth her father had given her the gold ring she  still wore, and which had the magic power of growing cold as the  hours neared daybreak, and such was her dawning sign.    Then did Elf know of their exchange, and he told Hiordis that long  had he loved her and felt pity for her sorrow, and that he would make  her his wife. So that night she sat on the high-seat with the crown  on her head, and dreamt of what had been and what was to be.      So passeth the summer season, and the harvest of the year,    And the latter days of the winter on toward the springtide wear.          BOOK II.    REGIN.      _Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund._        Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son;    There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done,    And glad was the dawn's awakening, and the noontide fair and glad:    There no great store had the franklin, and enough the hireling had;    And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land    With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand.    'Twas a country of cunning craftsmen, and many a thing they wrought,    That the lands of storm desired, and the homes of warfare sought.    But men deemed it o'er-well warded by more than its stems of fight,    And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might.    So hidden was that country, and few men sailed its sea,    And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk's company.    But fair-fruited, many-peopled, it lies a goodly strip,    'Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood's surging lip,    And a perilous flood is its ocean, and its mountains, who shall tell    What things, in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell.           *       *       *       *       *      Again, in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man    Beardless and low of stature, of visage pinched and wan:    So exceeding old was Regin, that no son of man could tell    In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell:    But the youth of King Elf had he fostered, and the Helper's youth thereto,    Yea and his father's father's: the lore of all men he knew,    And was deft in every cunning, save the dealings of the sword:    So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned, that men trowed his every word;    His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight    With the latter days of sorrow; all tales he told aright;    The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he;    And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea;    Nor might any learn him leech-craft, for before that race was made,    And that man-folk's generation, all their life-days had he weighed.    In this land of the Helper and Elf, his son, dwelt Hiordis, and here  her son, the last of the Volsungs, was born. The babe had eyes of  such wondrous brightness that the folk shrank from him, while they  rejoiced over his birth, but his mother spake to the babe as to one  who might understand, and she told him of Sigmund and Volsung, of  their wars and their troubles and their joys. Then she gave him to  her maids to bear him to the kings of the land that they might  rejoice with her.      But there sat the Helper of Men with King Elf and his Earls in the hall,    And they spake of the deeds that had been, and told of the times to befall,    And they hearkened and heard sweet voices and the sound of harps draw nigh,    Till their hearts were exceeding merry and they knew not wherefore or why:    Then, lo, in the hall white raiment, as thither the damsels came,    And amid the hands of the foremost was the woven gold aflame.      \"O daughters of earls,\" said the Helper, \"what tidings then do ye bear?    Is it grief in the merry morning, or joy or wonder or fear?\"      Quoth the first: \"It is grief "]]]
