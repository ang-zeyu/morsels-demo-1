Our  sudden departure from the island, we imagined, must have proved some  disappointment to the inhabitants, as we noticed that a gun was fired at  the fort, shortly after our opening the bay; a signal, it was supposed,  to the country people to bring down their articles for trade and barter.    July.] On the 14th of July the fleet crossed the equator in the 26th  degree of east longitude. Such persons as had never before crossed the  Line were compelled to undergo the ridiculous ceremonies which those who  were privileged were allowed to perform on them.    From this time our weather was pleasant, and we had every appearance of  soon reaching our next port, the Rio de Janeiro, on the Brazil coast.    The track which we had to follow was too beaten to afford us any thing  new or interesting. Captain Phillip proposed making the Island of  Trinidada; but the easterly winds and southerly currents which we had met  with to the northward of the Line having set us so far to the westward  when we crossed it, he gave up all expectation of seeing it, and on the  28th altered his course, steering SW. Trinidada is laid down in 20  degrees 25 minutes south latitude, and 28 degrees 35 minutes west  longitude, while we at noon on the 29th were in 19 degrees 36 minutes  south latitude, and 33 degrees 18 minutes west longitude.    The longitude, when calculated by either altitudes of the sun, for the  time-piece (of Kendal's constructing, which was sent out by the Board of  Longitude), or by the means of several sets of lunar observations, which  were taken by Captain Hunter, Lieutenant Bradley, and Lieutenant Dawes,  was constantly shown to the convoy, for which purpose the signal was made  for the whole to pass under the stern of the _Sirius_, when a board was  set up in some conspicuous part of the ship with the longitude marked on  it to that day at noon.    A good look-out (to make use of the sea-phrase usual on these occasions)  was kept for an island, not very well known or described, which was laid  down in some charts, nearly in the track which we were to cross, but it  was not seen by any of the ships of the fleet; nor was implicit credit  given to its existence, although named (the island of Ascension) and a  latitude and longitude assigned to it. It was conjectured, that the  islands of Martin Vas and Trinidada, lying within about five leagues of  each other, had given rise to the idea of a new island, and that  Ascension was in reality one or other of those islands.    Only two accidents happened during the passage to the Brazils. A seaman  belonging to the _Alexander_ was so unfortunate as to fall overboard, and  could not be recovered--and a female convict on board the _Prince of  Wales_ was so much bruised by the falling of a boat from off the booms  (which, owing to the violent motion of the ship, had got loose) that she  died the following day, notwithstanding the professional skill and humane  attention of the principal surgeon; for as the boat in launching forward  fell upon the neck and crushed the vertebrae and spine, all the aid he  could render her was of no avail.    August.] On Thursday the 2nd of August we had the coast of South America  in sight; and the head-land, named Cape Frio, was distinctly seen before  the evening closed in. Our time-piece had given us notice when to look  out for it, and the land was made precisely to the hour in which it had  taught us to expect it. It was not, however, until the evening of the 4th  that we anchored within the islands at the entrance of the harbour of Rio  de Janeiro.    At day-break the next morning an officer was dispatched from the _Sirius_  to inform the viceroy of the arrival of the fleet; and he most readily  and politely promised us every assistance in his power. A ship bound to  Lisbon passing us about noon, that opportunity was taken of sending an  account to England of the fortunate progress which we had so far made in  the long voyage before us; soon after which the port-officer, or  harbour-master, came on board, and, the seabreeze beginning to blow, the  fleet got under sail. About five in the afternoon we crossed the bar, and  soon after passing the fort of Santa Cruz, saluted it with thirteen guns,  which were returned by an equal number of guns from the fort. While  saluting, it fell calm; but by the assistance of a light breeze which  afterwards sprung up, and the tide of flood, the _Sirius_ was enabled to  reach far enough in by seven o'clock to come to an anchor in the harbour  of Rio de Janeiro; the convoy also anchored as they came up, at the  distance of about a mile and a half from the landing-place, which was  found very commodious.    Our passage from Teneriffe, although rather a long one, had fortunately  been unattended with any disease, and the surgeon reported that we had  brought in only ninety-five persons sick, comprehending every description  of people in the fleet. Many, however, of this number were bending only  under the pressure of age and its attendant infirmities, having no other  complaints among them.    On the morning after our arrival the intendant of the port, with the  usual officers, repaired on board the _Sirius_, requiring the customary  certificates to be given, as to what nation she belonged to, whither  bound, the name of her commander, and his reason for coming into that  port; to all which satisfactory answers were given; and at eleven o'clock  the day following Captain Phillip, accompanied by the officers of the  settlement, civil and military, waited upon Don Louis Vasconcellos, the  viceroy of the Brazils, at his excellency's palace, who received them  with much politeness, readily assenting to a tent being pitched on shore  for the purpose of an observatory; as well as to the drawing of the Seine  in different parts of the bay for fish; only pointing out the  restrictions that would be necessary to prevent the sailors from  straggling into the country. On their taking leave, it was most politely  intimated, that no restraint would be imposed upon the officers, whenever  they came on shore to the town, in which they were free to pass wherever  they desired. A conduct so opposite to that in general observed to  foreigners in this port could by us be attributed only to the great  esteem in which Captain Phillip was held here by all ranks of people  during the time of his commanding a ship in the Portuguese service; for  on being informed of the employment he now held, the viceroy's guard was  directed to pay him the same honours during his stay here, that were paid  to himself as the representative of the crown of Portugal.    The palace of the viceroy stood in the Royal Square, of which, together  with the public prison, the mint, and the opera-house, it formed the  right wing. Of these buildings the opera-house alone was shut up; and we  were informed, that the gloom which was thrown over the court and kingdom  of Portugal by the death of the late king, had extended in full force to  the colonies also; all private and public amusements being since that  time discouraged as much as possible, the viceroy himself setting the  example. Once a week, indeed, his excellency had a music-meeting at the  palace for the entertainment of himself and a few select friends; but  nothing more.    The town of St. Sebastian (or, as it is more commonly named, the town of  Rio de Janeiro, which was in fact the name of the river forming the bay,  on the western side of which was built the town) is large, and was  originally designed to have had an elevated and airy situation, but was,  unfortunately for the inhabitants, erected on low ground along the shore,  and in a recess almost wholly out of the reach of the refreshing  seabreeze, which was observed to be pretty regular in its visitations.  The inhabitants, nevertheless, deemed the air salubrious; and we were  informed that epidemic distempers were rare among them. In their streets,  however, were frequently seen objects of wretchedness and misery,  crawling about with most painful and disgusting swellings in their legs  and privities. The hospital, which had formerly been a Jesuit's convent,  stood near the summit of the hill, in an open situation, at the back of  the town. From the great estimation in which English surgeons were held  here, it would seem that the town is not too well provided in that  respect. Senor Ildefonse, the principal in the place had studied in  England, where he went under the course of surgical education called  walking the hospitals, and might by his practice in this place, which was  considerable, and quite as much as he could attend to, have soon realised  a handsome fortune; but we understood, that to the poor or necessitous  sick he always administered _gratis_.    The township of the Rio de Janeiro was said to contain on the whole not  less than 40,000 people, exclusive of the native Indians and negroes.  These last appear to be very numerous, of a strong robust appearance, and  are brought from the coast of Guinea, forming an extensive article of  commerce. With these people of both sexes the streets were constantly  filled, scarcely any other description of people being seen in them.  Ladies or gentlemen were never seen on foot in the streets during the  day; those whose business or inclination led them out being carried in  close chairs, the pole of which came from the head of the vehicle, and  rested on the shoulders of the chairmen, having, notwithstanding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#8)"],[1," alone. I will help you all I can, and you shall see that  your real life is just beginning.\"    Amrei's eyes filled with tears at these words; and yet she could say  nothing, for she felt estranged toward this man. His voice appealed to  her, but when she looked at him, she felt as if she would have liked to  run away.    Damie now came with the key. Amrei started to take it from him, but he  would not give it up. With the peculiar pedantic conscientiousness of a  child he declared that he had faithfully promised Coaly Mathew's wife to  give it to nobody but his uncle. Accordingly the uncle took it from him,  and it seemed to Amrei as if a magic secret door were being opened when  the key for the first time rattled in the lock and turned--the hasp went  down and the door opened! A strange chill, like that of a vault, came  creeping from the black front-room, which had also served as a kitchen.  A little heap of ashes still lay on the hearth, and on the door the  initials of Caspar Melchior Balthasar and the date of the parent's  death, were written in chalk. Amrei read it aloud--her own father had  written it.    \"Look,\" cried Damie, \"the eight is shaped just as you make it, and as  the master won't have it--you know--from right to left.\"    Amrei motioned to him to keep quiet. She thought it terrible and sinful  that Damie should talk so lightly--here, where she felt as if she were  in church, or even in eternity--quite out of the world, and yet in the  very midst of it. She herself opened the inside door; the room was dark  as a grave, for the shutters were closed. A single sunbeam, shining  through a crack in the wall, fell on the angel's head on the tile stove  in such a way that the angel seemed to be laughing. Amrei crouched down  in terror. When she looked up again, her uncle had opened one of the  shutters, and the warm, outside air poured in. How cold it seemed in  there! None of the furniture was left in the room but a bench nailed to  the wall. There her mother used to spin, and there she had put Amrei's  little hands together and taught her to knit.    \"Come, children, let us go now,\" said the uncle. \"It is not good to be  here. Come with me to the baker and I will buy you each a white roll--or  do you like biscuits better?\"    \"No, let us stay here a little longer,\" said Amrei; and she kept on  stroking the place where her mother had sat. Then, pointing to a white  spot on the wall, she said, half in a whisper: \"There our cuckoo clock  used to hang, and there our father's discharge from the army. And there  the hanks of yarn that mother spun used to hang--she could spin even  better than Black Marianne--Black Marianne has said so herself. She  always got a skein more out of a pound than anybody else, and it was  always so even--not a knot in it. And do you see that ring up there on  the ceiling? It was beautiful to see her twisting the threads there. If  I had been old enough to know then, I would not have let them sell  mother's spindle--it would have been a fine legacy for me. But there was  nobody to take any interest in us. Oh, mother dear! Oh, father dear! If  you knew how we have been pushed about, it would grieve you, even in  eternity.\"    Amrei began to weep aloud, and Damie wept with her; even the uncle dried  his eyes. He again urged them to come away from the place; he was vexed  for having caused himself and the children this grief. But Amrei said in  a decided way:    \"Even if you do go, I shall not go with you.\"    \"How do you mean? You will not go with me at all?\"    Amrei started; for she suddenly realized what she had said, and it  seemed to her almost as if it had been an inspiration. But presently she  answered:    \"No, I don't know about that yet. I merely meant to say, that I shall  not willingly leave this house until I have seen everything again. Come,  Damie, you are my brother--come up into the attic. Do you remember where  we used to play hide-and-seek, behind the chimney? And then we'll look  out of the window, where we dried the truffles. Don't you remember the  bright florin father got for them?\"    Something rustled and pattered across the ceiling. All three started,  and the uncle said quickly:    \"Stay where you are, Damie, and you too. What do you want up there?  Don't you hear the mice running about?\"    \"Come with me--they won't eat us!\" Amrei insisted. Damie, however,  declared that he would not go, and Amrei, although she felt a secret  fear, took courage and went upstairs alone. But she soon came down  again, looking as pale as death, with nothing in her hand but a bundle  of old straws.    \"Damie says he'll go with me to America,\" said the uncle, as she came  forward. Amrei, breaking up the straws in her hands, replied: \"I've  nothing to say against it. I don't know yet what I shall do, but he can  go if he likes.\"    \"No,\" cried Damie, \"I shan't do that. You did not go with Dame Landfried  when she wanted to take you away, and so I shall not go off alone  without you.\"    \"Well, then, think it over--you are sensible enough,\" said the uncle, to  conclude the matter. He then closed the shutters again, so that they  stood in the dark, and hurried the children out of the room and through  the vestibule, locked the outside door, and went to take the key back to  Coaly Mathew. After that he started for the village with Damie alone.  When he was some way off, he called back to Amrei:    \"You have until tomorrow morning--then I shall go away whether you go  with me or not.\"    Amrei was left alone. She looked after the retreating figures and  wondered how one person could go away from another.    \"There he goes,\" she thought, \"and yet he belongs to you, and you to  him.\"    Strange! As in a sleep-dream, a subject that has been lightly touched  upon is renewed and interwoven with all sorts of strange details, so was  it now with Amrei in her waking-dream. Damie had made but a passing  allusion to the meeting with Farmer Landfried's wife. The remembrance of  her had half faded away; but now it suddenly rose up fresh again--like a  picture of past life in a vision. Amrei said to herself, almost aloud:    \"Who knows if she may not thus suddenly think of you? One cannot tell  why she should, and yet perhaps she is thinking of you at this very  moment. For in this place she promised to be your protectress whenever  you came to her,--it was yonder by the stunted willows. Why is it, that  only the trees remain to be seen? Why is not a word like a tree,  something which stands firmly, something which one can hold to. Yes, one  can, if one will. Then one is as well off as a tree--and what an  honorable farmer's wife says, is firm and lasting. She, too, wept  because she had to go away from her native place, although she had been  married and away from it for a long time. And she has children of her  own--one of them is called John.\"    Amrei was standing by the tree where they had picked the berries. She  laid her hand upon the trunk and said:    \"You--why don't you go away, too? Why don't people tell you to emigrate?  Perhaps for you, too, it would be better elsewhere. But, to be sure, you  are too large--you did not place yourself here, and who knows if you  would not die in some other place. You can only be hewn down, not  transplanted. Nonsense! I also had to leave my home. If it were my  father, I should be obliged to go with him--he would not need to ask me.  And he who asks too much, goes astray. No one can advise me in this  matter, not even Marianne. And, after all, with my uncle, it's like  this: 'I am doing you a good turn, and you must repay me.' If he's  severe with me, and with Damie, because he's awkward, and we have to run  away, where in this wide, strange world are we to go? Here everybody  knows us, and every hedge, every tree has a familiar face. 'You know me,  don't you?' she said, looking up at the tree. 'Oh, if you could but  speak! God created you too--why cannot you speak? You knew my father and  mother so well--why cannot you tell me what they would advise me to do?'  Oh, dear father! Oh, dear mother! It grieves me so to have to go away! I  have nothing here, and hardly anybody, and yet I feel as if I were being  driven out of a warm bed into the cold snow. Is this deep sadness that I  feel a sign that I ought not to go? Is it the true voice of conscience,  or is it but a foolish fear? Oh, good Heaven, I do not know! If only a  voice from Heaven would come now and tell me!\"    The child trembled with inward terror, and the sense of life's  difficulties for the first time arose vividly within her. And again she  went on, half-thinking, half-talking to herself--but this time in a more  decided way:    \"If I were alone, I know for certain that I should not go; I should  stay here. For it would grieve me too much. Alone I could get along.  Good--remember that; of one thing, then, you are sure--as to yourself  you are decided. But what foolish thoughts are these! How can I imagine  that I am alone, and without Damie? I am not alone--I belong to Damie,  and he belongs to me. And for Damie it would be better if he had a  fatherly hand to guide him--it would help him up. But why do you want  anybody else, Amrei?--can you not take care of him yourself, if it be  necessary? If he once starts out in that way, I can see that he'll be  nothing but a servant all his life, a drudge for other people. And who  knows how uncle's children will behave toward us? Because they're poor  people themselves, they'll play the masters with us. No, no! I'm sure  they're good,--and it would be a fine thing to be able to say: 'Good  morning, cousin.' If uncle had only brought one of the children with  him, I could decide much better--I could find out about things. Oh, good  heavens, how difficult all this is!\"    Amrei sat down by the tree. A chaffinch came hopping along, picked up a  seed, looked around him, and flew away. Something crept across Amrei's  face; she brushed it"]]]
