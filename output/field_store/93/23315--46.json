The Kaiser undertook the task of mediator, but the  action ordered by him was hardly in motion, when Russia began to  mobilize all her forces against Austria-Hungary. (Excited shouts of  indignation and disgust.) But Austria had only mobilized certain army  corps against Serbia, besides which she had only two corps, and these  were far from the Russian frontier.    \"At this juncture the Kaiser informed the Czar that the mobilization of  his armies against Austria would increase the difficulties of mediation,  a task which he had undertaken at the Czar's express wish, and perhaps  render it impossible. Nevertheless, we continued our mediatory action in  Berlin, and indeed in a form which went to the limits permitted by our  alliance. (Great excitement.) During this time Russia renewed her  assurances that she was taking no military measures against us.    \"We come to July 3ist. In Vienna a decision was to be arrived at on that  day. By our representations we had already brought it about that Vienna,  which for a time was not in direct communication with St. Petersburg,  had commenced direct discussion again. But before Vienna could come to a  final decision, the news came that Russia was mobilizing--_i.e._,  against us too--her whole forces. (Cries of indignation.) The Russian  Government, although fully aware from our repeated representations what  a mobilization on our frontiers means, did not notify this step to us,  and gave us no explanations concerning it.    \"As late as the afternoon of July 31st a telegram came from the Czar to  the Kaiser in which the former pledged himself that his army should take  up no provocative attitude against us. (Great excitement.) But the  hostile mobilization on the Russian frontier was in full swing during  the night July 30th-31st. While we were mediating in Berlin the Russian  armies appeared on our long and almost entirely open frontier. France  was not yet mobilizing, but, as she admits, was already taking  precautionary measures.    \"And we? Up till then we had not--the Imperial Chancellor spoke with  great emotion and repeatedly struck the table while uttering these  words--called up a single reservist, out of a loving regard for the  peace of Europe. (Loud cries of 'Bravo!') Were we then to wait on in  patience till the Powers between which we are wedged should choose their  moment to strike? (A hurricane of voices, 'No!') To expose Germany to  this danger would be a crime. (Stormy, general and long continued cries  of 'Quite true!' and 'Bravo!' in which the Social Democrats joined too.)    \"Therefore on July 31st we requested Russia to demobilize as the only  measure which could save the European peace. (Loud applause.) The  Imperial Ambassador in St. Petersburg further received instructions to  inform the Russian Government, that in case our demand was rejected, we  should consider ourselves in a state of war with Russia. The Imperial  Ambassador has carried out these instructions.    \"What answer Russia accorded to our demand for demobilization we do not  know even to-day. Telegraphic announcements on this point have not  reached us, although matters of far less importance have been sent over  the wires. Hence, long after the expiration of the stated time, the  Kaiser saw himself compelled to mobilize our forces at 5 o'clock on  August 1st.    \"Simultaneously, it was necessary for us to inquire regarding France's  attitude. In answer to our definite question whether, in case of a  Russo-German war, France would remain neutral, the French Government has  replied that they will act as their interests dictate. (Laughter.) This  was at least an evasion, if not a negative answer to our question.    \"In spite of this, the Kaiser ordered that the French frontier should be  respected. This order was strictly obeyed with one single exception.  France, who mobilized at the same time as ourselves, declared that she  would respect a ten-kilometre zone along her frontiers. (Cries of  indignation.) And what happened in reality? Their airmen have thrown  bombs, cavalry patrols have violated our territory, and companies have  broken into Alsace-Lorraine. (Indignation.) Therewith, France, although  war has not yet been declared, has attacked our territories.    \"As regards the single exception which I have referred, I have received  the following report from the Chief of the General Staff: In respect to  French complaints of violations of her frontiers, only one case is  admitted. Against express orders an officer with a patrol from the 14th  Army Corps crossed the French frontier on August 2nd. Apparently they  were shot down; only one man has returned. But long before this single  instance occurred, French airmen had penetrated into Southern Germany  and dropped bombs, and French troops had attacked our  frontier-protection-troops in the Schlucht Pass. Up till now our  soldiers have confined themselves entirely to protecting the frontier.    \"So far the report from the Chief of the General Staff.    \"We are now in a position of self-defence, and necessity knows no  law![21] (Cries of 'Quite right!') Our troops have occupied Luxembourg,  perhaps they have already entered Belgium. (Loud applause.) That is a  breach of international law. The French Government, it is true, had  declared in Brussels that they would respect Belgian neutrality so long  as their opponent respected it. But we knew that France stood ready to  invade it. (Cries of indignation.)    [Footnote 21: This sentence seems so important that I give the original:  \"Wir sind jetzt in der Notwehr, und Not kennt kein Gebot!\"]    \"France could wait, we could not; and a French attack in our flank on  the Lower Rhine might have been disastrous for us. Thus we were  compelled to ignore the protests of the Luxembourg and Belgian  Governments.    \"The injustice which we commit thereby, we shall try to make good again  as soon as our military goal is attained. Anyone who fights for the  highest, as we do now, may only think of how he may hack his way  through. (Hurricanes of applause; long continued hand-clapping in the  whole house and on the tribune.)    \"Gentlemen, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with Austria-Hungary.  Concerning England's attitude, the declaration made by Sir Edward Grey  in the House of Commons yesterday has made the standpoint which the  English Government takes up quite clear.    \"We have declared to the English Government that as long as England  remains neutral, our fleet shall not attack the North Coast of France.  Further, that we shall not disturb the integrity and independence of  Belgium. I repeat this declaration before the whole world and I may add  that if England will remain neutral, we are prepared--assuming mutual  treatment--to undertake no hostile operations against France's  commercial marine. (Applause.)    \"Gentlemen, so much for events up till now! I repeat the words of the  Kaiser: 'We enter the struggle with a clear conscience!' (Great  enthusiasm.) We are fighting for the fruits of our labours in peace, for  the heritage of a great past, and for our future. The fifty years are  not yet ended within which Moltke said we should stand at arms to defend  the heritage and the achievements of 1870. The hour of great trial has  struck for our nation. But we look forward to it with absolute  confidence. (Tremendous applause.)    \"Our army is in the field, our fleet is ready, and behind them the  entire German nation (roars of never-ending applause and hand-clapping  in the whole house)--the whole German nation! (These words were  accompanied by a gesture towards the Social Democrats.--Renewed outburst  of applause, in which the Social Democrats also joined.)    \"Gentlemen, you know your duty in its entirety. The vote of credit  requires no further argument, I beg you to pass it quickly. (Loud  applause.)\"[22]    [Footnote 22: _Berliner Tageblatt_, August 5th.]    Unfortunately this eloquent exposition of Germany's case contains  inaccuracies which can only be described as conscious untruths. I have  already made myself responsible for the statement: \"Lying has always  been the foundation stone of German policy.\"[23] Earl Cromer, in  commenting on this, gives additional evidence of its veracity.[24]    [Footnote 23: \"Soul of Germany,\" p. 192.]    [Footnote 24: _The Spectator_, August 7th, 1915, p. 169.]    The German Chancellor, when he justified his policy by the dictum:  \"Necessity knows no law,\" evidently meant that necessity also recognizes  no law of truth. In any case, he remained faithful to the traditions of  his country. Although the German Press is both venal and supine, we  shall see that it has done the world a service and played its own  Government a foul trick. (Der deutschen Regierung einen boesen Streich  gespielt.)    When Bethmann-Hollweg was thumping the table before him, and assuring  his immediate hearers and the world in general that the Berlin cabinet  had not called up a single reservist before five o'clock on Saturday,  August 1st, he was guilty of a deliberate falsehood. On July 31st, I  left Erlangen by the 3.31 train for Nuremberg; travelling in the same  train was Dr. Haack, professor of the history of art in Erlangen  University. He was accompanied by his wife and various colleagues,  including Professor Busch, who bade him farewell on the platform. Dr.  Haack is an artillery reserve officer, and he was then going to join his  regiment. At 8.30 p.m. on the same day, we spoke to Frau Haack on  Nuremberg station. The lady's face was very tear-stained and she was  about to return to Erlangen alone. She told us in a broken voice that  her husband had been called up.    In \"The Soul of Germany\" I have given names and dates of other cases. I  do not propose to disgrace my word of honour by playing it off against  the German Chancellor. But acting on the principle of \"Set "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#8)"],[1,"W. had been threatened, beaten, shot at,  and otherwise intimidated.    The Chamber of Commerce sent an imperative appeal to representative  wheat-raisers, ranchers, lumbermen, farmers, and bade them come to  Spokane to discuss the situation. They met at the Hotel Davenport, where  luncheon was served in one of the magnificently appointed dining-halls  of that most splendid hotel in the West.    The lion of this group of Spokane capitalists was Riesinberg, a man of  German forebears, but all American in his sympathies, with a son already  in the army. Riesinberg was president of a city bank and of the Chamber  of Commerce. His first words to the large assembly of clean-cut,  square-jawed, intent-eyed Westerners were: \"Gentlemen, we are here to  discuss the most threatening and unfortunate situation the Northwest was  ever called upon to meet.\" His address was not long, but it was  stirring. The Chamber of Commerce could provide unlimited means, could  influence and control the state government; but it was from the visitors  invited to this meeting, the men of the outlying districts which were  threatened, that objective proofs must come and the best methods of  procedure.    The first facts to come out were that many crops were ruined already,  but, owing to the increased acreage that year, a fair yield was  expected; that wheat in the Bend would be a failure, though some farmers  here and there would harvest well; that the lumber districts were not  operating, on account of the I.W.W.    Then it was that the organization of men who called themselves the  Industrial Workers of the World drew the absorbed attention of the  meeting. Depredations already committed stunned the members of the  Chamber of Commerce.    President Riesinberg called upon Beardsley, a prominent and intelligent  rancher of the southern wheat-belt. Beardsley said:        \"It is difficult to speak with any moderation of the outrageous      eruption of the I.W.W. It is nothing less than rebellion, and the      most effective means of suppressing rebellion is to apply a little      of that 'direct action' which is the favorite diversion of the      I.W.W.'s.        \"The I.W.W. do not intend to accomplish their treacherous aims by      anything so feeble as speech; they scorn the ballot-box. They are      against the war, and their method of making known their protest is      by burning our grain, destroying our lumber, and blowing up      freight-trains. They seek to make converts not by argument, but by      threats and intimidation.        \"We read that Western towns are seeking to deport these rebels. In      the old days we can imagine more drastic measures would have been      taken. The Westerners were handy with the rope and the gun in those      days. We are not counseling lynch law, but we think deportation is      too mild a punishment.        \"We are too 'civilized' to apply the old Roman law, 'Spare the      conquered and extirpate the rebels,' but at least we could intern      them. The British have found it practicable to put German prisoners      to work at useful employment. Why couldn't we do the same with our      rebel I.W.W.'s?\"    Jones, a farmer from the Yakima Valley, told that business men,  housewives, professional men, and high-school boys and girls would help  to save the crop of Washington to the nation in case of labor trouble.  Steps already had been taken to mobilize workers in stores, offices, and  homes for work in the orchards and grain-fields, should the I.W.W.  situation seriously threaten harvests.    Pledges to go into the hay or grain fields or the orchards, with a  statement of the number of days they were willing to work, had been  signed by virtually all the men in North Yakima.    Helmar, lumberman from the Blue Mountains, spoke feelingly; he said:        \"My company is the owner of a considerable amount of timbered lands      and timber purchased from the state and from individuals. We have      been engaged in logging that land until our operations have been      stopped and our business paralyzed by an organization which calls      itself the Industrial Workers of the World, and by members of that      organization, and other lawless persons acting in sympathy with      them.        \"Our employees have been threatened with physical violence and      death.        \"Our works are picketed by individuals who camp out in the forests      and who intimidate and threaten our employees.        \"Open threats have been made that our works, our logs, and our      timber will all be burned.        \"Sabotage is publicly preached in the meetings, and in the      literature of the organization it is advised and upheld.        \"The open boast is made that the lumbering industry, with all other      industry, will be paralyzed by this organization, by the destruction      of property used in industry and by the intimidation of laborers who      are willing to work.        \"A real and present danger to the property of my company exists.      Unless protection is given to us it will probably be burned and      destroyed. Our lawful operations cannot be conducted because      laborers who are willing to work are fearful of their lives and are      subject to abuse, threats, and violence. Our camps, when in      operation, are visited by individuals belonging to the said      organization, and the men peaceably engaged in them threatened with      death if they do not cease work. All sorts of injury to property by      the driving of spikes in logs, the destruction of logs, and other      similar acts are encouraged and recommended.        \"As I pointed out to the sheriff of our county, the season is a very      dry one and the woods are and will be, unless rain comes, in danger      of disastrous fires. The organization and its members have openly      and repeatedly asserted that they will burn the logs in the woods      and burn the forests of this company and other timber-holders before      they will permit logging operations to continue.        \"Many individuals belonging to the organization are camped in the      open in the timbered country, and their very presence is a fire      menace. They are engaged in no business except to interfere with the      industry and to interfere with the logging of this company and      others who engaged in the logging business.        \"We have done what we could in a lawful manner to continue our      operations and to protect our employees. We are now helpless, and      place the responsibility for the protection of our property and the      protection of our employees upon the board of county commissioners      and upon the officers of the county.\"    Next President Riesinberg called upon a young reporter to read  paragraphs of an I.W.W. speech he had heard made to a crowd of three  hundred workmen. It was significant that several members of the Chamber  of Commerce called for a certain paragraph to be reread. It was this:        \"If you working-men could only stand together you could do in this      country what has been done in Russia,\" declared the I.W.W. orator.      \"You know what the working-men did there to the slimy curs, the      gunmen, and the stool-pigeons of the capitalistic class. They bumped      them off. They sent them up to say, 'Good morning, Jesus.'\"    After a moment of muttering and another silence the president again  addressed the meeting:        \"Gentlemen, we have Anderson of Golden Valley with us to-day. If      there are any of you present who do not know him, you surely have      heard of him. His people were pioneers. He was born in Washington.      He is a type of the men who have made the Northwest. He fought the      Indians in early days and packed a gun for the outlaws--and to-day,      gentlemen, he owns a farm as big as Spokane County. We want to hear      from him.\"    When Anderson rose to reply it was seen that he was pale and somber.  Slowly he gazed at the assembly of waiting men, bowed; then he began,  impressively:        \"Gentlemen an' friends, I wish I didn't have to throw a bomb into      this here camp-fire talk. But I've got to. You're all talkin' I.W.W.      Facts have been told showin' a strange an' sudden growth of this      here four-flush labor union. We've had dealin's with them for      several years. But this year it's different.... All at once they've      multiplied and strengthened. There's somethin' behind them. A big      unseen hand is stackin' the deck.... An', countrymen, that      tremendous power is German gold!\"    Anderson's deep voice rang like a bell. His hearers sat perfectly  silent. No surprise showed, but faces grew set and hard. After a pause  of suspense, in which his denunciation had time to sink in, Anderson  resumed:        \"A few weeks ago a young man, a stranger, came to me an' asked for a      job. He could do anythin', he said. An' I hired him to drive my car.      But he wasn't much of a driver. We went up in the Bend country one      day, an' on that trip I got suspicious of him. I caught him talkin'      to what I reckoned was I.W.W. men. An' then, back home again, I      watched him an' kept my ears open. It didn't take long for me to      find discontent among my farm-hands. I hire about a hundred hands on      my ranches durin' the long off season, an' when harvest comes round      a good many more. All I can get, in fact.... Well, I found my hands      quittin' me, which was sure onusual. An' I laid it to that driver.        \"One day not long ago I run across him hobnobbin' with the strange      man I'd seen talkin' with him on the Bend trip. But my driver--Nash,      he calls himself--didn't see me. That night I put a cowboy to watch      him. An' what this cowboy heard, put together two an' two, was that      Nash was assistant to an I.W.W. leader named Glidden. He had sent      for Glidden to come to look over my ranch. Both these I.W.W. men had      more money than they could"]]]
