It has taken over the ethics of the family, filial  piety, obedience and respect for elders, and has made them a part of its  system. Transgression of these fundamental duties is visited by dire  punishments in the next world. The faithful observance is followed not  only by the rewards of the Confucian system, but results in the greatest  rewards in the future life.    _1. Kuan Yin, the Giver of Children and Protector of Women_    Buddhism has done more. Out of its atmosphere of love and mercy toward  all beings has developed Kuan Yin, the ideal of Chinese womanhood, the  goddess of Mercy, who embodies the Chinese ideal of beauty, filial piety  and compassion toward the weak and suffering. She is especially the  goddess of women, being interested in all their affairs. Her image is  found in almost every household and her temples have a place in every  part of China.    A brief history of this deity will enable us to understand the  significance of the cult. Kuan Yin started as a male god in India,  called Avalôkitêsvara, who was worshipped from the third to the seventh  century of our era. He was the protector of sailors and people in  danger. In the course of time, either in China or in India, the god  became a goddess. Some think that this was due to the influence of  Christianity. In China both forms survive, though the goddess is better  known. A Buddhist once said that a Bodhisattva is neither male nor  female and appears in whatever form is convenient.    Kuan Yin is a very popular goddess. Her experiences in Hades are  dramatically presented by traveling theatrical companies. Her deeds of  mercy are portrayed in art. Her well known story runs as follows:    Kuan Yin was the daughter of the ruler of a prosperous kingdom located  somewhere near the island of Sumatra. Her birth was announced to the  queen by a dream. The little girl ate no meat nor milk. Her disposition  was very good. Her intelligence was most extraordinary. Once she read  anything she never forgot it.    At the age of sixteen her father tried to betroth her to a young prince.  She refused and decided to give herself to a life of fasting and  abstinence. Angered b-v her obstinacy the father ordered her to take off  her court dress and jewels, to put on the garb of a servant and to carry  water for the garden. The garden never looked so beautiful. The daughter  also looked well and showed no signs of weariness, because the gods  assisted her in her work.    Relenting a little the king sent an older sister to urge Kuan Yin to  accept the husband he had found for her. When she refused, he sent her  to a monastery and charged the abbess to treat her harshly, so that she  might be forced to return home. Expecting to win the king's favor, the  abbess put the most unpleasant tasks on the girl. But again the gods  assisted her and made her work light, so that her tasks were always well  done and the young woman was cheerful.    One day the report came to the king that his daughter was associating  with a young monk discussing heterodox doctrines and that she had given  birth to a child. This news so enraged the king that he burned the  monastery, killing many monks. The princess was captured and brought  before him. Inasmuch as she was obdurate, the king ordered her to be  executed. The executioner's sword, however, broke into a thousand pieces  without doing her any injury. The king then ordered her to be strangled.  A golden image sixteen feet high appeared on the spot. The princess  laughed and cried: \"Where there was no image, an image appeared. I see  the real form. When body flesh is strangled, then appear the lights of  ten thousand roads.\" She went to purgatory and purgatory at once changed  into paradise. Yama, in order to save his purgatory, sent her back to  the world. She appeared at Puto, an island off the coast of Chekiang  near Ningpo. Here she rescued sailors and performed many miracles for  people in distress.    In the meantime the father, who had committed many sins, became sick.  His allotted time of life had been shortened by twenty years. Moreover,  an ulcer grew on his body for every one of the five hundred monks he had  killed when he burned the monastery. A miserable, loathsome old man, he  came to an old monk, who was really the princess in disguise, and asked  for help. The monk told him that an eye and an arm of a blood relative  made into medicine was the only cure for his trouble. The two living  daughters were willing to make such an offering, but their husbands  would not permit them to do so. The old monk urged the monarch to take  up a life of abstinence, to rebuild the monastery he had burned, and to  provide money for services to take the five hundred monks whom he had  killed through purgatory. He also said that a nun in the convent would  offer an arm and an eye. When the monarch entered the monastery, he  found hanging before the incense burner an arm and an eye. These were  boiled, mixed with medicine and rubbed on the king's body. He soon  became well. Further inquiry revealed that these members belonged to his  daughter.    This is the story of the most popular goddess in China. She is  worshipped by her devotees on the first and fifteenth of every month, on  the nineteenth of the sixth month, when she became a Bodhisattva, and on  the nineteenth of the ninth month, when she put on the necklace. A month  after marriage every young bride is presented with an image of the  Goddess of Mercy, an incense-burner and candlesticks.    This goddess is worshipped whenever trouble comes to man or woman. Her  names signify her willingness to listen to all prayers. She is the \"one  who regards the voice,\" i.e., prayer; \"one who hears the prayers of the  world;\" \"one who regards and exists by himself as sovereign;\" \"the  ancestor of Buddha who regards prayer;\" \"one who frees from fear;\"  \"Buddha the august king;\" \"the great white robed scholar;\" \"great  compassion and mercy.\"    _2. Kuan Yin, the Model of Local Mother-Goddesses_    This conception is the creation of the social and religious  consciousness of the women in China. It reveals their aspirations for  mercy, compassion, filial piety and for the beauty that crowns a well  developed character. Such an ideal does not mean that these have been  realized in all the numerous homes of the Chinese, but it manifests  their sense of such an ideal to be realized in life and their ardent  longing for its realization.    Mother-goddesses are found all over China and they have all of them been  influenced by Kuan Yin. Some of them have originated with actual women  who were deified after death. Here is the story of one of these  goddesses who presides over the censer in a small temple in Formosa. She  was born in the province of Kuangtung. At the age of seven she was  adopted by a family as the future wife of their eighteen-year-old son.  One day while crossing a river he was drowned. This was a great blow to  her. When she was fourteen years old the father of the family died. The  two women, thus left alone, wept bitterly day and night. The comfort of  relatives was of little avail. The mother was becoming emaciated with  grief. The daughter, unable to bear the strain any longer, washed  herself, burned incense before the ancestral tablet of her betrothed,  and then took this vow:    \"I am willing to remain a virgin, to apply myself to carrying water and  working at the mortar and to serve my mother-in-law. If I cherish any  other purpose and change my chastity and obedience, may Heaven slay me  and earth annihilate me.\"    When the mother heard this vow she stopped her weeping. Inasmuch as they  had no uncle to look after them, they worked day and night. A relative  of her future husband gave her one of his sons as an adopted son. The  child died after a few months. This was a great grief. Then the mother  died. The daughter sold her possessions to obtain money for a proper  burial. She had only a coarse mourning cloth for her dress. After a  while she adopted a child as her son. When he grew up she found him a  wife who served her as faithfully as she had served her mother-in-law.  When she was eighty years old, she dreamed that the golden maid and jade  messenger of Kuan Yin stood beside her saying: \"The court of Heaven has  ordered you to become a god (shên).\" She died soon after this. She said  of herself:    \"Shang Ti took compassion upon me during my life, because with a firm  heart I kept my chastity and served my mother-in-law with complete  obedience. Therefore he gave me the office of Kuan Pin. I have performed  my duties in several places. Now I am transferred to Formosa.\"    This story and many others like it mirror the moral ideals of the women  of China in the midst of their struggles for help and light and  guidance.    _3. Exhortations on Family Virtues_    The Buddhists issue a large number of tracts. These are very commonly  paid for by devotees who make a vow that, if their parent becomes well,  they will pay for the printing of several hundred or thousand of these  tracts for free distribution. In these tracts are usually many stories  illustrating the rewards of filial piety. The story is told in one of  them about a Mrs. Chin whose father-in-law being ill was unable to  sleep for sixty days. His condition grew worse. Mrs. Chin knelt before  Kuan Yin's altar, cut out a piece of flesh from her arm and cooked it  with the father's food. His health at once improved and he lived to the  age of seventy-seven. Another story is told in the same tract of a woman  who cut out a piece of her liver and gave it as medicine to her  mother-in-law.    These Buddhist tracts take up all the moral habits which make the family  and clan strong and stable and surround them by the highest sanctions. A  tract picked up in a Buddhist temple at Hangchow purports to be the  revelation of the will of Buddha. It urges sixteen virtues.

From Ardra, Rhoodra, and the lands beyond came all High Prophets  of the Earth to the Temple in Aradec of All the gods save One.    And then they told Imbaun how The Secret of Things was upon the  summit of the dome of the Hall of Night, but faintly writ, and in  an unknown tongue.    Midway in the night, between the setting and the rising sun, they  led Imbaun into the Hall of Night, and said to him, chaunting  altogether: \"Imbaun, Imbaun, Imbaun, look up to the roof, where is  writ The Secret of Things, but faintly, and in an unknown tongue.\"    And Imbaun looked up, but darkness was so deep within the Hall of  Night that Imbaun saw not even the High Prophets who came from  Ardra, Rhoodra, and the lands beyond, nor saw he aught in the Hall  of Night at all.    Then called the High Prophets: \"What seest thou, Imbaun?\"    And Imbaun said: \"I see naught.\"    Then called the High Prophets: \"What knowest thou Imbaun?\"    And Imbaun said: \"I know naught.\"    Then spake the High Prophet of Eld of All the gods save One, who  is first on Earth of prophets: \"O Imbaun! we have all looked  upwards in the Hall of Night towards the secret of Things, and  ever it was dark, and the Secret faint and in an unknown tongue.  And now thou knowest what all High Prophets know.\"    And Imbaun answered: \"I know.\"    So Imbaun became High Prophet in Aradec of All the gods save One,  and prayed for all the people, who knew not that there was  darkness in the Hall of Night or that the secret was writ faint  and in an unknown tongue.    These are the words of Imbaun that he wrote in a book that all the  people might know:    \"In the twentieth night of the nine hundredth moon, as night came  up the valley, I performed the mystic rites of each of the gods in  the temple as is my wont, lest any of the gods should grow angry  in the night and whelm us while we slept.    \"And as I uttered the last of certain secret words I fell asleep  in the temple, for I was weary, with my head against the altar of  Dorozhand. Then in the stillness, as I slept, there entered  Dorozhand by the temple door in the guise of a man, and touched me  on the shoulder, and I awoke.    \"But when I saw that his eyes shone blue and lit the whole of the  temple I knew that he was a god though he came in mortal guise.  And Dorozhand said: 'Prophet of Dorozhand, behold that the people  may know.' And he showed me the paths of Sish stretching far down  into the future time. Then he bade me arise and follow whither he  pointed, speaking no words but commanding with his eyes.    \"Therefore upon the twentieth night of the nine hundredth moon I  walked with Dorozhand adown the paths of Sish into the future  time.    \"And ever beside the way did men slay men. And the sum of their  slaying was greater than the slaying of the pestilence of any of  the evils of the gods.    \"And cities arose and shed their houses in dust, and ever the  desert returned again to its own, and covered over and hid the  last of all that had troubled its repose.    \"And still men slew men.    \"And I came at last to a time when men set their yoke no longer  upon beasts but made them beasts of iron.    \"And after that did men slay men with mists.    \"Then, because the slaying exceeded their desire, there came peace  upon the world that was brought by the hand of the slayer, and men  slew men no more.    \"And cities multiplied, and overthrew the desert and conquered its  repose.    \"And suddenly I beheld that THE END was near, for there was a  stirring above Pegana as of One who grows weary of resting, and I  saw the hound Time crouch to spring, with his eyes upon the  throats of the gods, shifting from throat to throat, and the  drumming of Skarl grew faint.    \"And if a god may fear, it seemed that there was fear upon the  face of Dorozhand, and he seized me by the hand and led me back  along the paths of Time that I might not see THE END.    \"Then I saw cities rise out of the dust again and fall back into  the desert whence they had arisen; and again I slept in the Temple  of All the gods save One, with my head against the altar of  Dorozhand.    \"Then again the Temple was alight, but not with light from the  eyes of Dorozhand; only dawn came all blue out of the East and  shone through the arches of the Temple. Then I awoke and performed  the morning rites and mysteries of All the gods save One, lest any  of the gods be angry in the day and take away the Sun.    \"And I knew that because I who had been so near to it had not  beheld THE END that a man should never behold it or know the doom  of the gods. This They have hidden.\"        OF HOW IMBAUN MET ZODRAK      The prophet of the gods lay resting by the river to watch the  stream run by.    And as he lay he pondered on the Scheme of Things and the works of  all the gods. And it seemed to the prophet of the gods as he  watched the stream run by that the Scheme was a right scheme and  the gods benignant gods; yet there was sorrow in the Worlds. It  seemed that Kib was bountiful, that Mung calmed all who suffer,  that Sish dealt not too harshly with the hours, and that all the  gods were good; yet there was sorrow in the Worlds.    Then said the prophet of the gods as he watched the stream run by:  \"There is some other god of whom naught is writ.\" And suddenly the  prophet was aware of an old man who bemoaned beside the river,  crying: \"Alas! alas!\"    His face was marked by the sign and the seal of exceeding many  years, and there was yet vigour in his frame. These be the words  of the prophet that he wrote in his book: \"I said: 'Who art thou  that bemoans beside the river?' And he answered: 'I am the fool.'  I said: 'Upon thy brow are the marks of wisdom such as is stored  in books.' He said: 'I am Zodrak. Thousands of years ago I tended  sheep upon a hill that sloped towards the sea. The gods have many  moods. Thousands of years ago They were in a mirthful mood. They  said: 'Let Us call up a man before Us that We may laugh in  Pegana.'\"    \"'And Their eyes that looked on me saw not me alone but also saw  THE BEGINNING and THE END and all the Worlds besides. Then said  the gods, speaking as speak the gods: \"Go, back to thy sheep.\"    \"'But I, who am the fool, had heard it said on earth that whoso  seeth the gods upon Pegana becometh as the gods, if so he demand  to Their faces, who may not slay him who hath looked them in the  eyes.    \"'And I, the fool, said: \"I have looked in the eyes of the gods,  and I demand what a man may demand of the gods when he hath seen  Them in Pegana.\" And the gods inclined Their heads and Hoodrazai  said: \"It is the law of the gods.\"    \"'And I, who was only a shepherd, how could I know?    \"'I said: \"I will make men rich.\" And the gods said: \"What is  rich?\"    \"'And I said: \"I will send them love.\" And the gods said: \"What is  love?\" And I sent gold into the Worlds, and, alas! I sent with it  poverty and strife. And I sent love into the Worlds, and with it  grief.    \"'And now I have mixed gold and love most woefully together, and I  can never remedy what I have done, for the deeds of the gods are  done, and nothing may undo them.    \"'Then I said: \"I will give men wisdom that they may be glad.\" And  those who got my wisdom found that they knew nothing, and from  having been happy became glad no more.    \"'And I, who would make men happy, have made them sad, and I have  spoiled the beautiful scheme of the gods.    \"'And now my hand is for ever on the handle of Their plough. I was  only a shepherd, and how should I have known?    \"'Now I come to thee as thou restest by the river to ask of thee  thy forgiveness, for I would fain have the forgiveness of a man.'    \"And I answered: 'O Lord of seven skies, whose children are the  storms, shall a man forgive a god?'    \"He answered: 'Men have sinned not against the gods as the gods  have sinned against men since I came into Their councils.'    \"And I, the prophet, answered: 'O Lord of seven skies, whose  plaything is the thunder, thou art amongst the gods, what need  hast thou for words from any man?'    \"He said: 'Indeed I am amongst the gods, who speak to me as they  speak to other gods, yet is there always a smile about Their  mouths, and a look in Their eyes that saith: \"Thou wert a man.\"'    \"I said: 'O Lord of seven skies, about whose feet the Worlds are  as drifted sand, because thou biddest me, I, a man, forgive thee.'    \"And he answered: 'I was but a shepherd, and I could not know.'  Then he was gone.\"        PEGANA      The prophet of the gods cried out to the gods: \"O! All the gods  save One\" for none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, \"where shall the  life of a man abide when Mung hath made against his body the sign  of Mung?--for the people with whom ye play have sought to know.\"    But the gods answered, speaking through the mist:    \"Though thou shouldst tell thy secrets to the beasts, even that  the beasts should understand, yet will not the gods divulge the  secret of the gods to thee, that gods and beasts and men shall be  all the same, all knowing the same things.\"    That night Yoharneth-Lahai came to Aradec, and said unto Imbaun:  \"Wherefore wouldst thou know the secret of the gods that not the  gods may tell thee?    \"When the wind blows not, where, then, is the wind?    \"Or when thou art not living, where art thou?    \"What should the wind care for the hours of calm or thou for  death?    \"Thy life is long, Eternity is short.    \"So short that, shouldst thou die and Eternity should pass, and  after the passing of Eternity thou shouldst live again, thou  wouldst say: 'I closed mine eyes but for an instant.'    \"There is an eternity behind thee as well as one before. Hast thou  bewailed the aeons that passed without thee, who art so much  afraid of the aeons that shall pass?\"    Then said the prophet: \"How shall I tell the people that the gods  have not spoken and their prophet doth not know? For then should I  be prophet no longer, and another"]]]
