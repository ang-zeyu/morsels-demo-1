On the street corners with laughter  Traffic the flower-girls. Beauty  Blossoms once more for thy pleasure    In many places.                                                        10    Gentlier now falls the twilight,  With the slim moon in the pear-trees;  And the green frogs in the meadows  Blow on shrill pipes to awaken    Thee, Lityerses.                                                       15    Gladlier now crimson morning  Flushes fair-built Mitylene,--  Portico, temple, and column,--  Where the young garlanded women  Praise thee with singing.                                                20    Ah, but what burden of sorrow  Tinges their slow stately chorus,  Though spring revisits the glad earth?  Wilt thou not wake to their summons,    O Lityerses?                                                           25    Shall they then never behold thee,--  Nevermore see thee returning  Down the blue cleft of the mountains,  Nor in the purple of evening    Welcome thy coming?                                                    30    Nevermore answer thy glowing  Youth with their ardour, nor cherish  With lovely longing thy spirit,  Nor with soft laughter beguile thee,    O Lityerses?                                                           35    Heedless, assuaged, art thou sleeping  Where the spring sun cannot find thee,  Nor the wind waken, nor woodlands  Bloom for thy innocent rapture  Through golden hours?                                                    40    Hast thou no passion nor pity  For thy deserted companions?  Never again will thy beauty  Quell their desire nor rekindle,    O Lityerses?                                                           45    Nay, but in vain their clear voices  Call thee. Thy sensitive beauty  Is become part of the fleeting  Loveliness, merged in the pathos    Of all things mortal.                                                  50    In the faint fragrance of flowers,  On the sweet draft of the sea-wind,  Linger strange hints now that loosen  Tears for thy gay gentle spirit,    O Lityerses!                                                           55          EPILOGUE      Now the hundred songs are made,  And the pause comes. Loving Heart,  There must be an end to summer,  And the flute be laid aside.    On a day the frost will come,                                             5  Walking through the autumn world,  Hushing all the brave endeavour  Of the crickets in the grass.    On a day (Oh, far from now!)  Earth will hear this voice no more;                                      10  For it shall be with thy lover  As with Linus long ago.    All the happy songs he wrought  From remembrance soon must fade,  As the wash of silver moonlight                                          15  From a purple-dark ravine.    Frail as dew upon the grass  Or the spindrift of the sea,  Out of nothing they were fashioned  And to nothing must return.                                              20    Nay, but something of thy love,  Passion, tenderness, and joy,  Some strange magic of thy beauty,  Some sweet pathos of thy tears,    Must imperishably cling                                                  25  To the cadence of the words,  Like a spell of lost enchantments  Laid upon the hearts of men.    Wild and fleeting as the notes  Blown upon a woodland pipe,                                              30  They must haunt the earth with gladness  And a tinge of old regret.    For the transport in their rhythm  Was the throb of thy desire,  And thy lyric moods shall quicken                                        35  Souls of lovers yet unborn.    When the golden days arrive,  With the swallow at the eaves,  And the first sob of the south-wind  Sighing at the latch with spring,                                        40    Long hereafter shall thy name  Be recalled through foreign lands,  And thou be a part of sorrow  When the Linus songs are sung.

The Series of \"King's Classics,\" issued under the General Editorship of  Professor I. GOLLANCZ, aims at introducing to the larger reading public  many noteworthy works of literature not readily accessible in cheap form,  or not hitherto rendered into English. Each volume is edited by some expert  scholar, and has a summary introduction dealing with the main and essential  facts of the literary history of the book; at the end there are the  necessary notes for a right understanding of references and textual  difficulties; where necessary, there is also a carefully-compiled index. As  will be at once seen from the accompanying list, much original and new work  has been secured for the Series, and it will be recognised that the \"King's  Classics\" differentiate themselves in a very marked way from the many  reprints of popular books.    It should be noted, however, that while primarily rare masterpieces are  included in the \"King's Classics,\" modern popular classics, more especially  such as have not yet been adequately or at all annotated, are not excluded  from the Series.           *       *       *       *       *    NOTE.--_At the date of this list, May 1, 1907, Nos. 1-35 were published.

The savages followed in single file, with Joe  and Jim in the middle of the line. The last Indian tried to mount  Lance; but the thoroughbred would have none of him, and after  several efforts the savage was compelled to desist. Mose trotted  reluctantly along behind the horse.    Although the chief preserved a dignified mien, his braves were  disposed to be gay. They were in high glee over their feat of  capturing the palefaces, and kept up an incessant jabbering. One  Indian, who walked directly behind Joe, continually prodded him with  the stock of a rifle; and whenever Joe turned, the brawny redskin  grinned as he grunted, \"Ugh!\" Joe observed that this huge savage had  a broad face of rather a lighter shade of red than his companions.  Perhaps he intended those rifle-prods in friendliness, for although  they certainly amused him, he would allow no one else to touch Joe;  but it would have been more pleasing had he shown his friendship in  a gentle manner. This Indian carried Joe's pack, much to his own  delight, especially as his companions evinced an envious curiosity.  The big fellow would not, however, allow them to touch it.    \"He's a cheerful brute,\" remarked Joe to Jim.    \"Ugh!\" grunted the big Indian, jamming Joe with his rifle-stock.    Joe took heed to the warning and spoke no more. He gave all his  attention to the course over which he was being taken. Here was his  first opportunity to learn something of Indians and their woodcraft.  It occurred to him that his captors would not have been so gay and  careless had they not believed themselves safe from pursuit, and he  concluded they were leisurely conducting him to one of the Indian  towns. He watched the supple figure before him, wondering at the  quick step, light as the fall of a leaf, and tried to walk as  softly. He found, however, that where the Indian readily avoided the  sticks and brush, he was unable to move without snapping twigs. Now  and then he would look up and study the lay of the land ahead; and  as he came nearer to certain rocks and trees he scrutinized them  closely, in order to remember their shape and general appearance. He  believed he was blazing out in his mind this woodland trail, so that  should fortune favor him and he contrive to escape, he would be able  to find his way back to the river. Also, he was enjoying the wild  scenery.    This forest would have appeared beautiful, even to one indifferent  to such charms, and Joe was far from that. Every moment he felt  steal stronger over him a subtle influence which he could not  define. Half unconsciously he tried to analyze it, but it baffled  him. He could no more explain what fascinated him than he could  understand what caused the melancholy quiet which hung over the  glades and hollows. He had pictured a real forest so differently  from this. Here was a long lane paved with springy moss and fenced  by bright-green sassafras; there a secluded dale, dotted with  pale-blue blossoms, over which the giant cottonwoods leaned their  heads, jealously guarding the delicate flowers from the sun. Beech  trees, growing close in clanny groups, spread their straight limbs  gracefully; the white birches gleamed like silver wherever a stray  sunbeam stole through the foliage, and the oaks, monarchs of the  forest, rose over all, dark, rugged, and kingly.    Joe soon understood why the party traveled through such open forest.  The chief, seeming hardly to deviate from his direct course, kept  clear of broken ground, matted thickets and tangled windfalls. Joe  got a glimpse of dark ravines and heard the music of tumbling  waters; he saw gray cliffs grown over with vines, and full of holes  and crevices; steep ridges, covered with dense patches of briar and  hazel, rising in the way. Yet the Shawnee always found an easy path.    The sun went down behind the foliage in the west, and shadows  appeared low in the glens; then the trees faded into an indistinct  mass; a purple shade settled down over the forest, and night brought  the party to a halt.    The Indians selected a sheltered spot under the lee of a knoll, at  the base of which ran a little brook. Here in this inclosed space  were the remains of a camp-fire. Evidently the Indians had halted  there that same day, for the logs still smouldered. While one brave  fanned the embers, another took from a neighboring branch a haunch  of deer meat. A blaze was soon coaxed from the dull coals, more fuel  was added, and presently a cheerful fire shone on the circle of  dusky forms.    It was a picture which Joe had seen in many a boyish dream; now that  he was a part of it he did not dwell on the hopelessness of the  situation, nor of the hostile chief whose enmity he had incurred.  Almost, it seemed, he was glad of this chance to watch the Indians  and listen to them. He had been kept apart from Jim, and it appeared  to Joe that their captors treated his brother with a contempt which  they did not show him. Silvertip had, no doubt, informed them that  Jim had been on his way to teach the Indians of the white man's God.    Jim sat with drooping head; his face was sad, and evidently he took  the most disheartening view of his capture. When he had eaten the  slice of venison given him he lay down with his back to the fire.    Silvertip, in these surroundings, showed his real character. He had  appeared friendly in the settlement; but now he was the relentless  savage, a son of the wilds, free as an eagle. His dignity as a chief  kept him aloof from his braves. He had taken no notice of the  prisoners since the capture. He remained silent, steadily regarding  the fire with his somber eyes. At length, glancing at the big  Indian, he motioned toward the prisoners and with a single word  stretched himself on the leaves.    Joe noted the same changelessness of expression in the other dark  faces as he had seen in Silvertip's. It struck him forcibly. When  they spoke in their soft, guttural tones, or burst into a low, not  unmusical laughter, or sat gazing stolidly into the fire, their  faces seemed always the same, inscrutable, like the depths of the  forest now hidden in night. One thing Joe felt rather than  saw--these savages were fierce and untamable. He was sorry for Jim,  because, as he believed, it would be as easy to teach the panther  gentleness toward his prey as to instill into one of these wild  creatures a belief in Christ.    The braves manifested keen pleasure in anticipation as to what they  would get out of the pack, which the Indian now opened. Time and  again the big brave placed his broad hand on the shoulder of a  comrade Indian and pushed him backward.    Finally the pack was opened. It contained a few articles of wearing  apparel, a pair of boots, and a pipe and pouch of tobacco. The big  Indian kept the latter articles, grunting with satisfaction, and  threw the boots and clothes to the others. Immediately there was a  scramble. One brave, after a struggle with another, got possession  of both boots. He at once slipped off his moccasins and drew on the  white man's foot-coverings. He strutted around in them a few  moments, but his proud manner soon changed to disgust.    Cowhide had none of the soft, yielding qualities of buckskin, and  hurt the Indian's feet. Sitting down, he pulled one off, not without  difficulty, for the boots were wet; but he could not remove the  other. He hesitated a moment, being aware of the subdued merriment  of his comrades, and then held up his foot to the nearest one. This  chanced to be the big Indian, who evidently had a keen sense of  humor. Taking hold of the boot with both hands, he dragged the  luckless brave entirely around the camp-fire. The fun, however, was  not to be all one-sided. The big Indian gave a more strenuous pull,  and the boot came off suddenly. Unprepared for this, he lost his  balance and fell down the bank almost into the creek. He held on to  the boot, nevertheless, and getting up, threw it into the fire.    The braves quieted down after that, and soon lapsed into slumber,  leaving the big fellow, to whom the chief had addressed his brief  command, acting, as guard. Observing Joe watching him as he puffed  on his new pipe, he grinned, and spoke in broken English that was  intelligible, and much of a surprise to the young man.    \"Paleface--tobac'--heap good.\"    Then, seeing that Joe made no effort to follow his brother's  initiative, for Jim was fast asleep, he pointed to the recumbent  figures and spoke again.    \"Ugh! Paleface sleep--Injun wigwams--near setting sun.\"    On the following morning Joe was awakened by the pain in his legs,  which had been bound all night. He was glad when the bonds were cut  and the party took up its westward march.    The Indians, though somewhat quieter, displayed the same  carelessness: they did not hurry, nor use particular caution, but  selected the most open paths through the forest. They even halted  while one of their number crept up on a herd of browsing deer. About  noon the leader stopped to drink from a spring; his braves followed  suit and permitted the white prisoners to quench their thirst.    When they were about to start again the single note of a bird far  away in the woods sounded clearly on the quiet air. Joe would not  have given heed to it had he been less attentive. He instantly  associated this peculiar bird-note with the sudden stiffening of  Silvertip's body and his attitude of intense listening. Low  exclamations came from the braves as they bent to catch the lightest  sound. Presently, above the murmur of the gentle fall of water over  the stones, rose that musical note once more. It was made by a bird,  Joe thought, and yet, judged by the actions of the Indians, how  potent with meaning beyond that of the simple melody of the woodland  songster! He turned, half expecting to see somewhere in the  tree-tops the bird which"]]]
