He washed McTee to the waist, cleansed the  cut places carefully, and covered them with narrow strips of adhesive  tape which he found in a small medicine chest. As the heavier breathing  of the captain indicated that he was about to recover his senses,  Harrigan performed the same services for himself. It was slow work, for  now that the stimulus of action was gone, his weakness grew on him in  recurrent waves. Finally a sound made him turn to see McTee propping  himself up on the bunk with one elbow; his eyes, unconfused and steady,  looked brightly out at Harrigan.    \"You beat me?\"    \"It was the swing of the deck that rolled you over and broke your grip.  I've stayed to tell you that.\"    \"Chances or no chances, you beat me.\"    \"Man, you'd have busted my back if it hadn't been for that buck of the  ship. When your hand came away, it took the skin with it.\"    \"And that's why you didn't finish me?\"    \"Aye.\"    \"You'll never have the chance again.\"    \"I want no chances; I want no help except my own strength as it was  before you withered me with your hellfire.\"    \"When we stand up again, I'll kill you, Harrigan.\"    \"When we stand up again, I'll break you, Black McTee--like a rotten  stick.\"    \"Lie down here,\" said the captain, rising quickly. \"You're sick.\"    He forced Harrigan onto the bunk and stretched him out at full length.  The Irishman clenched his hands and fought against the sleep which  crept over his senses.    \"There's fire in my brain,\" muttered Harrigan, \"an' it's trying to burn  its way out.\"    McTee dipped a towel in cool water.    \"I kept the rest of them away,\" went on the Irishman. \"When you woke  up, I wanted you to hear why I didn't finish you.\"    He raised his shaking hands and gripped at the air.    \"Ah-h! When me ould silf is back, I'll shtand up to ye. Tis a promise,  McTee. Black McTee, Black McTee--I'll make ye Red McTee--red as the  palms av me hands.\"    McTee tied the cold, wet towel around Harrigan's forehead.    \"I'll kill you by inches, Harrigan. You'll read hell in my eyes before  your end. Drink this!\"    He raised Harrigan's almost lifeless head and forced the neck of a  whisky bottle between his teeth.    \"Ah-h!\" said Harrigan, blinking and coughing after the strong liquor  had burned its way down his throat. \"The feel av your throat under me  thumbs was sweeter than the touch av a colleen's hand, McTee! I'm dead  for shlape!\"    And instantly his eyes closed; his breathing was deep and sonorous. The  captain watched him for a long moment, then sat down and laying a hand  on the sleeping man's wrist, he counted the pulse carefully. It was  irregular and feeble.    \"Time is all he needs,\" muttered McTee to himself, and he sat staring  before him, dreaming. \"A fool can live well,\" he was thinking, \"but it  takes a great man to die well. Harrigan will make a fine death.\" In the  meantime the big Irishman slept heavily, and Black McTee tended him  well, keeping the towel cool and wet about his forehead. The pulse was  gaining rapidly in strength and regularity; sleep seemed to act upon  Harrigan as food acts upon a starved man. At times he smiled, and McTee  could guess at the dream which caused it. He was dreaming of killing  McTee, and McTee sat by and understood, and smiled with deep content.  He, also, was tasting his thoughts of the battle-to-be when, without  any warning rap, the door swung open and the burly form of Bos'n  Masters appeared.    \"The first mate--\" he began.    \"Did you knock?\"    \"I've got no time to waste, the first mate--\"    McTee rose. In the frank, bold eyes of the bos'n he read the open  revolt, and understood. He had been beaten in open battle; his crew  felt that they were liberated by the victory of their champion.    \"Who told you to enter without knocking?\" he broke  in.    \"I don't need telling,\" said the dauntless bos'n. \"The first mate's  drunk an'--\"    The heavy fist of McTee landed on Masters's mouth and hurled him in a  heap into the corner of the cabin. The captain seized him by the nape  of the neck and jerked him back to his feet, blinking and gasping,  thoroughly subdued.    \"Get out and come in as you should.\"    The bos'n fled. A moment later a timid knock came at the door and McTee  bade him enter. He stepped in, cap in hand, his eyes on the floor.    \"The first mate's drunk, sir, an' runnin' amuck with the ship. He's at  the wheel an' he won't leave it. We've nearly scraped one reef already.  You know this ain't any open sea, sir. There's green water everywhere.\"    \"Go up and give the fool my orders. Tell the second officer to take the  wheel.\"    The bos'n retreated, but he returned within a few moments.    \"He won't leave the wheel,\" he reported. \"He said you could take your  orders to the devil, sir.\"    \"I'll tie him to the deck and skin him alive,\" said McTee calmly. \"Stay  here and watch Harrigan while I--\"    He was jerked from his feet and hurled across the room, crashing  against the cabin wall. When his senses returned, he was sitting on the  floor staring stupidly into the white face of the bos'n, who was in a  similar posture. Harrigan, who had been flung from the bunk, staggered  to his feet.    \"What the deuce is up?\" asked the Irishman.    A chorus of piercing yells rose in answer from the deck outside.    \"The end of the _Mary Rogers_,\" said McTee. \"Stay with me, Harrigan.\"    He caught the latter by the arm and dragged him out onto the deck. The  hull of the ship at the bow must have been literally ripped away by the  impact against the reef; already the deck sloped sharply to the bows.    McTee raised a voice that rang like a trumpet over the clamor as he  gave his orders to clear away the boats. If he had been a moment  earlier, he might have succeeded in getting at least one of them safely  launched, but now the _Mary Rogers_ was settling to her doom with a  speed which made the crew senseless with terror. A half-gale which  promised to swell soon into a veritable hurricane seemed to be lifting  the freighter by the heel and driving her nose into the sea. The quick  settling twilight of the tropics made the waters doubly cold and dark.    Not till the bows of the _Mary Rogers_ were deep below the waves and  her propeller humming loudly in the air did the captain desist from his  efforts to bring order out of the panic of the crew. Half a dozen men,  with the Chinaman at their head, had cut one boat from its davits, but  plunging into it before it fairly struck the water, they tipped it far  to one side. It filled instantly and sank, leaving its occupants  struggling on the surface. The Chinaman, who apparently could not swim,  gave up the struggle at once. He threw his clutching hands high above  his head and went down; his scream was the first death cry of the wreck  of the _Mary Rogers_.    McTee, with Harrigan at his heels, rushed for the second lifeboat.  Under the directions of the captain, pointed and emphasized by blows of  his fist, the boat was swung safely from the davits and lowered to the  sea. The instant that it rode the waves, bouncing up and down on the  choppy surface, the crew began leaping in, the drunken mate being the  first overside.    The lifeboat was loaded from stem to stern, and only Harrigan, McTee,  and half a dozen more remained on the ship when the boat swung a dozen  feet away from the _Mary Rogers_ and with the next wave was picked up  and smashed against the freighter. Its side went in like a matchbox  pressed by a strong thumb, and it zigzagged quickly below the surface.  The yells of the swimmers rose in a long wail. McTee caught Harrigan by  the shoulder and shouted in his ear: \"Stay close and do what I do.\"    \"Miss Malone!\" yelled Harrigan in answer, and pointed.    She stood by the after-cabin, clinging to the rail with one hand while  she attempted to adjust a life preserver with the other. The _Mary  Rogers_ lurched forward, a long slide that buried half of the ship  under the sea. A giant wave towered above the side and licked the  wheelhouse away.    \"Let her go!\" roared McTee. \"Save ourselves and let her  go.\"    It was a matter of seconds now before the last of the _Mary Rogers_  should disappear. They clambered up to the after-cabin.    \"For the love av God, McTee, she's a woman!\"      The Irishman struggled up the deck toward the girl, but the captain  caught him and held him fast.    \"There's one chance,\" shouted Black McTee, and he pointed to the litter  of the wrecked wheelhouse which tossed on the waves. \"Overboard and  make for a big timber.\"    But the eyes of Harrigan held on the form of the girl. They could only  make out the shadow of her form with her hair blowing wildly on the  wind. Then as swift as the sway of a bird's wing, a mass of black water  tossed over the side of the _Mary Rogers_. When it was gone, the  shadowy figure of the girl had disappeared with it.    \"Now!\" thundered McTee.    \"Aye,\" said Harrigan.          CHAPTER 9      They climbed the rail. Plainly Harrigan had made them delay too long,  for now they had not time to swim beyond the reach of the swirl that  would form when the ship went down. The _Mary Rogers_ lurched to her  grave as they sprang from the rail. A wave caught them and washed them  beyond the grip of the whirlpool; another wave swung them back, and the  waters sucked them down. Such was the force of that downward pull that  it seemed to Harrigan as if a weight were attached to either foot. He  drew a great, gasping breath before his head went under and then struck  out with all his might.    When his lungs seemed bursting with the labor, he whirled to the  surface again and drew another gasping breath. The storm had torn a  rift in the clouds and through it looked the moon as if some god were  peering through the curtain of mist to watch the havoc he was working.

Though he  despaired of their standing up against the Romans, he ordered them in  the Roman style, appointing a large number of subordinate officers and  teaching them the use of signals and a few elementary military  movements. His army ultimately consisted of 60,000 footmen, 4,500  mercenaries, in whom he put greatest trust, and 600 picked men as his  body-guard. He had little cavalry, but as Galilee was a country of  hills, this deficiency need not have proved fatal, had he been a  strategist or even a loyalist. During the eight months' respite that he  enjoyed before the appearance of the Roman army, he spent most of his  time in civil feud, and succeeded in dividing the population into two  hostile parties. He boasts that, though he took up his command at an age  when, if a man has happily escaped sin, he can scarcely guard himself  against slander, he was perfectly honest, and refrained from stealing  and peculation[2]; but he is at pains to prove that he threw every  obstacle in the way of the patriotic party, and did all that an open  enemy of the Jews could have done to undermine the defense of the  province.    [Footnote 1: B.J. II. xx. 6. His account of his actions in Galilee is,  however, from beginning to end, open to question; and the contemporary  account of Justus has unfortunately disappeared entirely. It is likely  that his rival's narrative would have shown him in a better light than  his own.]    [Footnote 2: Vita, 15.]    Before his arrival in the north, the leader of the national party was  John the son of Levi, a man of Gischala, which was one of the mountain  fastnesses in Northern Galilee, now known as Jish, near the town of  Safed.[1] Josephus heaps every variety of violent abuse upon him in  order, no doubt, to please his patrons. When he introduces him on the  scene, he describes him as \"a very knavish and cunning rogue, outdoing  all other rogues, and without his fellow for wicked practices. He was a  ready liar, and yet very sharp in gaining credit for his fictions. He  thought it a point of virtue to deceive, and would delude even those  nearest to him. He had an aptitude for thieving,\" and so forth. Whenever  the historian mentions the name of his rival, he rattles his box of  abusive epithets until the reader is wearied by the image of the monster  conjured up before him. But, unfortunately for his credit, Josephus also  records John's deeds, and these reveal him as one who, if at times cruel  and intriguing, yet lived and died for his country, while his enemy was  thinking of saving himself.    [Footnote 1: The Hebrew name of the fortress was [Hebrew: Nosh Halav],  meaning \"clot of cream\"; the place was so called because of the  fertility of the soil on which it stands.]    It is not surprising then that John, having eyes only for the defense of  the land, was not blind to the double-dealing of the priestly governor,  who had been sent by the Romanizing party to organize resistance. The  first event that brought about a collision between them was the  suspicious conduct of Josephus in the matter of some spoil seized from  the steward of King Agrippa and brought to Tarichea. Agrippa had  entirely turned his back on the national rising, and was the faithful  ally of the Romans. He was therefore an open enemy, and Tiberias, which  had been under his dominion, had revolted from him. Josephus upbraided  the captors for the violence they had offered to the king, and declared  his intention to return the spoil to the owner. A little later he  prevented John from destroying the corn in the province stored by the  Romans for themselves. The people were naturally indignant at this  conduct, and led by John and another Zealot, Jesus the son of Sapphias,  the governor of Tiberias, and by Justus of the same city, who was  afterwards to be a rival historian, they rose against Josephus. With  stratagems worthy of a better cause he evaded this onslaught.    More briefly in the _Wars_, and in the _Life_ at wearisome length,  Josephus tells a tale of intrigue and counter-intrigue, mutual attempts  at assassination, wiles and stratagems to undermine the power of each  other, which took place between him and John. The city of Tarichea was  his stronghold, Tiberias the hot-bed of the movement against him. The  part he professes to have played is so extraordinary in its meanness  that we are fain to believe that it is largely fiction, composed to show  that he was only driven in the end by danger of his life to fight  against the sacred power of Rome. However that may be, John reported his  doings to the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem, and that body, which was now, it  seems, in the control of the Pharisees and Zealots, sent a deputation to  recall him. Simon, the celebrated head of the Sanhedrin and leader of  the national party, had pressed for the dismissal of Josephus.[1]  Ananias, the ex-high priest and Sadducee, had at first been his  champion, but he had been overborne. The deputation consisted of two  Pharisees, Jonathan and Ananias, and two priests, Joazar and Simon.  Warned by his friends in Jerusalem of their coming, Josephus had all the  passes watched, seized the embassy, and recaptured the four cities that  had revolted from him: Sepphoris, Gamala, Gischala, and Tiberias.  According to the account in the _Wars_, the cities revolted again, and  were recaptured by similar stratagems; and when the disturbances in  Galilee were quieted in this way, the people, ceasing to prosecute their  civil dissensions, betook themselves to make preparations for the war  against the Romans. The invasion had begun in earnest, and Josephus,  fortified, as he said, by a dream, which told him not to be afraid,  because he was to fight with the Romans, and would live happily  thereafter, decided for the time not to abandon his post.    [Footnote 1: It is notable that this is the only reference in the work  of Josephus to the great Rabbi; the name of his successor in the  headship of the Sanhedrin, Johanan ben Zakkai, does not occur even  once.]    Josephus had displayed his administrative talents in these eight months  of peaceful government by losing all that had been gained in the four  months of the successful rebellion at Jerusalem. He now had an  opportunity of displaying his military abilities. In the spring of 67  C.E., Flavius Vespasian, the veteran commander of the legions in Germany  and Britain, who, on the defeat of Cestius Gallus, had been chosen by  Nero to conduct the Jewish campaign, brought his army of four legions  from Antioch to Ptolemais. He was met there by King Agrippa, who brought  a large force of auxiliaries, and by a deputation of citizens from  Sepphoris, the chief city of Galilee, who tendered their submission and  invited him to send a garrison. Josephus, though he knew of the city's  Romanizing leanings, had negligently or deliberately failed to occupy  it, so that the place was lost without a blow. He made a feeble effort  to recapture it, for appearance sake it would seem, and then, though he  had an unlimited choice of favorable positions, and the Roman forces  were not very large at the time, he abandoned the attempt of meeting the  enemy in the field. Titus arrived from Alexandria, with two more  legions, the fifth and the tenth, and then the Roman army, numbering  with auxiliaries 60,000 men, set out from Ptolemais, and proceeded to  occupy Galilee.    The Jewish forces were encamped on the hills above Sepphoris. Josephus  describes the wonderful array and order of the Roman army on the march.  The sight seems to have led a large part of his army to run away. He  himself, when he saw that he had not an army sufficient to engage the  enemy, despaired of the success of the war, and determined to place  himself as far as he could out of danger. In this inspiring mood he  abandoned the rest of the country, sent a dispatch to Jerusalem  demanding help, and threw himself into the fortress of Jotapata,  situated on the crest of a mountain in Northern Galilee, which he chose  as the most fit for his security. Vespasian, hearing of this step, and,  as Josephus modestly suggests, \"supposing that, could he only get  Josephus into his power, he would have conquered all Judea,\" straightway  laid siege to the town (Iyar 16). For forty-two days the place was  besieged, and during that period every resource that heroic resistance  could suggest, according to the narrative of its commandant, was  exhausted. The height of the wall was raised to meet the Roman  embankments, provisions were brought in by soldiers disguised in  sheep-skins, the Roman works were destroyed by fire, boiling oil was  poured on the assailants, and finally the city was not stormed till the  garrison was worn out with famine and fatigue. But, as has been pointed  out, the details recorded are \"the commonplaces of poliorcetics,\" and  may have been borrowed by Josephus from some military text-book and  neatly applied. Jotapata fell on the first day of Tammuz, and whatever  the heroism of his army, the general did not shine in the last days of  his command or in the manner of his surrender. Suspected by his men and  threatened by them with death, he was unable to give himself up openly.  He took refuge with some of his comrades in a deep pit, where they were  discovered by an old woman, who informed the Romans. Vespasian, who, we  are again told, believed that, if he captured Josephus, the greater part  of the war would be over, sent one Nicanor, well known to the Jewish  commandant, to take him. Josephus, professing prophetical powers,  offered to surrender, and quieted his conscience by a secret prayer to  God, which is a sad compound of cant and cowardice:    \"Since it pleaseth Thee, who hast created the Jewish nation, now to  bring them low, and since their good fortune is gone over to the Romans,  and since Thou"]]]
