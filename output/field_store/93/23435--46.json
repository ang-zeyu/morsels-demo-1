[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#8)"],[1,"speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially,  about politics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its  organisation, its industry, and prosperity; the finances are in the  greatest perfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian  subjects, that it must be a great compensation for all his extreme  trouble.\" But her other uncle by no means shared her sentiments. He  could not, he said, put up with a water-drinker; and King Leopold would  touch no wine. \"What's that you're drinking, sir?\" he asked him one day  at dinner. \"Water, sir.\" \"God damn it, sir!\" was the rejoinder. \"Why  don't you drink wine? I never allow anybody to drink water at my table.\"    It was clear that before very long there would be a great explosion; and  in the hot days of August it came. The Duchess and the Princess had  gone down to stay at Windsor for the King's birthday party, and the King  himself, who was in London for the day to prorogue Parliament, paid a  visit at Kensington Palace in their absence. There he found that the  Duchess had just appropriated, against his express orders, a suite of  seventeen apartments for her own use. He was extremely angry, and, when  he returned to Windsor, after greeting the Princess with affection, he  publicly rebuked the Duchess for what she had done. But this was little  to what followed. On the next day was the birthday banquet; there were  a hundred guests; the Duchess of Kent sat on the King's right hand, and  the Princess Victoria opposite. At the end of the dinner, in reply  to the toast of the King's health, he rose, and, in a long, loud,  passionate speech, poured out the vials of his wrath upon the Duchess.  She had, he declared, insulted him--grossly and continually; she had  kept the Princess away from him in the most improper manner; she was  surrounded by evil advisers, and was incompetent to act with propriety  in the high station which she filled; but he would bear it no longer; he  would have her to know he was King; he was determined that his authority  should be respected; henceforward the Princess should attend at every  Court function with the utmost regularity; and he hoped to God that his  life might be spared for six months longer, so that the calamity of a  regency might be avoided, and the functions of the Crown pass directly  to the heiress-presumptive instead of into the hands of the \"person now  near him,\" upon whose conduct and capacity no reliance whatever could  be placed. The flood of vituperation rushed on for what seemed an  interminable period, while the Queen blushed scarlet, the Princess burst  into tears, and the hundred guests sat aghast. The Duchess said not a  word until the tirade was over and the company had retired; then in  a tornado of rage and mortification, she called for her carriage and  announced her immediate return to Kensington. It was only with the  utmost difficulty that some show of a reconciliation was patched up, and  the outraged lady was prevailed upon to put off her departure till the  morrow.    Her troubles, however, were not over when she had shaken the dust  of Windsor from her feet. In her own household she was pursued by  bitterness and vexation of spirit. The apartments at Kensington were  seething with subdued disaffection, with jealousies and animosities  virulently intensified by long years of propinquity and spite.    There was a deadly feud between Sir John Conroy and Baroness Lehzen.  But that was not all. The Duchess had grown too fond of her Major-Domo.  There were familiarities, and one day the Princess Victoria discovered  the fact. She confided what she had seen to the Baroness, and to the  Baroness's beloved ally, Madame de Spath. Unfortunately, Madame de Spath  could not hold her tongue, and was actually foolish enough to reprove  the Duchess; whereupon she was instantly dismissed. It was not so easy  to get rid of the Baroness. That lady, prudent and reserved, maintained  an irreproachable demeanour. Her position was strongly entrenched; she  had managed to secure the support of the King; and Sir John found that  he could do nothing against her. But henceforward the household was  divided into two camps.(*) The Duchess supported Sir John with all the  abundance of her authority; but the Baroness, too, had an adherent who  could not be neglected. The Princess Victoria said nothing, but she had  been much attached to Madame de Spath, and she adored her Lehzen. The  Duchess knew only too well that in this horrid embroilment her daughter  was against her. Chagrin, annoyance, moral reprobation, tossed her  to and fro. She did her best to console herself with Sir John's  affectionate loquacity, or with the sharp remarks of Lady Flora  Hastings, one of her maids of honour, who had no love for the Baroness.  The subject lent itself to satire; for the pastor's daughter, with all  her airs of stiff superiority, had habits which betrayed her origin. Her  passion for caraway seeds, for instance, was uncontrollable. Little bags  of them came over to her from Hanover, and she sprinkled them on her  bread and butter, her cabbage, and even her roast beef. Lady Flora could  not resist a caustic observation; it was repeated to the Baroness, who  pursed her lips in fury, and so the mischief grew.         (*) Greville, IV, 21; and August 15, 1839 (unpublished).       \"The cause of the Queen's alienation from the Duchess and       hatred of Conroy, the Duke (of Wellington) said, was       unquestionably owing to her having witnessed some       familiarities between them. What she had seen she repeated       to Baroness Spaeth, and Spaeth not only did not hold her       tongue, but (he thinks) remonstrated with the Duchess       herself on the subject. The consequence was that they got       rid of Spaeth, and they would have got rid of Lehzen, too,       if they had been able, but Lehzen, who knew very well what       was going on, was prudent enough not to commit herself, and       who was, besides, powerfully protected by George IV and       William IV, so that they did not dare to attempt to expel       her.\"    V    The King had prayed that he might live till his niece was of age; and  a few days before her eighteenth birthday--the date of her legal  majority--a sudden attack of illness very nearly carried him off. He  recovered, however, and the Princess was able to go through her  birthday festivities--a state ball and a drawing-room--with unperturbed  enjoyment. \"Count Zichy,\" she noted in her diary, \"is very good-looking  in uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein looks remarkably  well in his pretty Hungarian uniform.\" With the latter young gentleman  she wished to dance, but there was an insurmountable difficulty. \"He  could not dance quadrilles, and, as in my station I unfortunately cannot  valse and gallop, I could not dance with him.\" Her birthday present  from the King was of a pleasing nature, but it led to a painful domestic  scene. In spite of the anger of her Belgian uncle, she had remained upon  good terms with her English one. He had always been very kind to her,  and the fact that he had quarrelled with her mother did not appear to  be a reason for disliking him. He was, she said, \"odd, very odd and  singular,\" but \"his intentions were often ill interpreted.\" He now wrote  her a letter, offering her an allowance of L10,000 a year, which he  proposed should be at her own disposal, and independent of her mother.  Lord Conyngham, the Lord Chamberlain, was instructed to deliver the  letter into the Princess's own hands. When he arrived at Kensington, he  was ushered into the presence of the Duchess and the Princess, and, when  he produced the letter, the Duchess put out her hand to take it. Lord  Conyngham begged her Royal Highness's pardon, and repeated the King's  commands. Thereupon the Duchess drew back, and the Princess took the  letter. She immediately wrote to her uncle, accepting his kind proposal.  The Duchess was much displeased; L4000 a year, she said, would be quite  enough for Victoria; as for the remaining L6000, it would be only proper  that she should have that herself.    King William had thrown off his illness, and returned to his normal  life. Once more the royal circle at Windsor--their Majesties, the elder  Princesses, and some unfortunate Ambassadress or Minister's wife--might  be seen ranged for hours round a mahogany table, while the Queen netted  a purse, and the King slept, occasionally waking from his slumbers to  observe \"Exactly so, ma'am, exactly so!\" But this recovery was of short  duration. The old man suddenly collapsed; with no specific symptoms  besides an extreme weakness, he yet showed no power of rallying; and it  was clear to everyone that his death was now close at hand.    All eyes, all thoughts, turned towards the Princess Victoria; but she  still remained, shut away in the seclusion of Kensington, a small,  unknown figure, lost in the large shadow of her mother's domination. The  preceding year had in fact been an important one in her development. The  soft tendrils of her mind had for the first time begun to stretch out  towards unchildish things. In this King Leopold encouraged her. After  his return to Brussels, he had resumed his correspondance in a more  serious strain; he discussed the details of foreign politics; he laid  down the duties of kingship; he pointed out the iniquitous foolishness  of the newspaper press. On the latter subject, indeed, he wrote with  some asperity. \"If all the editors,\" he said, \"of the papers in the  countries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we  should have a crew to which you would NOT confide a dog that you would  value, still less your honour and reputation.\" On the functions of a  monarch, his views were unexceptionable. \"The business of the highest  in a State,\" he wrote, \"is certainly, in my opinion, to act with great  impartiality and a spirit of justice for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12655"],[0,"The Boy Mechanic, Volume 1: 700 Things for Boys to Do (#8)"],[1,"can make such a rack of the same  material as the desk, table or room furnishings and finish it in  the same manner.    The dimensions are given in the detail sketch. The two ends are  cut from 1/4-in. material, the bottom being 3/8 in. thick. Only  three pieces are required, and as they are simple in design,  anyone can cut them out with a    [Illustration: Details of the Rack]    saw, plane and pocket knife.  --Contributed by Wm.

Dobbins, Glenbrook, Conn.        ** Building a Small Photographic Dark Room [26]    In building a photographic dark room, it is necessary to make it  perfectly light-tight, the best material to use being matched  boards. These boards are tongued and grooved and when put together  effectually prevent the entrance of light.    The next important thing to be considered is to make it  weather-tight, and as far as the sides are concerned the matched  boards will do this also, but it is necessary to cover the roof  with felt or water-proof paper.    The best thickness for the boards is 1 in., but for cheapness 3/4  in. will do as well, yet the saving is so little that the 1-in.  boards are preferable.    The dark room shown in the accompanying sketch measures 3 ft. 6  in. by 2 ft. 6 in., the height to the eaves being 6 ft. Form the  two sides shown in Fig 1, fixing the crosspieces which hold the  boards together in such positions that the bottom one will act as  a bearer for the floor, and the second one for the developing  bench. Both sides can be put together in this way, and both  exactly alike. Keep the ends of the crosspieces back from the  edges of the boards far enough to allow the end boards to fit in  against them.    One of the narrow sides can be formed in the same way, fixing the  crosspieces on to correspond, and then these three pieces can be  fastened together by screwing the two wide sides on the narrow  one.    Lay the floor next, screwing or nailing the boards to the  crosspieces, and making the last board come even with the ends of  the crosspieces, not even with the boards themselves. The single  boards can then be fixed, one on each side of what will be the  doorway, by screwing to the floor, and to the outside board of the  sides. At the top of the doorway, fix a narrow piece between the  side boards, thus leaving a rectangular opening for the door.    The roof boards may next be put on, nailing them to each other at  the ridge, and to the sides of the room at the outsides and eaves.  They should overhang at the sides and eaves about 2 in., as shown  in Figs. 3 and 4.    One of the sides with the crosspieces in place will be as shown in  Fig. 2 in section, all the crosspieces and bearers intersecting  around the room.    The door is made of the same kind of boards held together with  crosspieces, one of which is fastened so as to fit closely to the  floor when the door is hinged, and act as a trap for the light.  The top crosspiece is also fastened within 1 in. of the top of the  door for the same reason.    Light traps are necessary at the sides and top of the door. That  at the hinged side can be as shown at A, Fig. 5, the closing side  as at B, and the top as at C in the same drawing. These are all in  section and are self-explanatory. In hinging the door, three butt  hinges should be used so as to keep the joint close.    The fittings of the room are as shown sectionally in Fig. 6, but  before fixing these it is best to line the room with heavy, brown  wrapping paper, as an additional safeguard against the entrance of  light.    The developing bench is 18 in. wide, and in the middle an opening,  9 by 11 in., is cut, below which is fixed the sink. It is shown in  detail in Fig. 7, and should be zinc lined.    The zinc should not be cut but folded as shown in Fig. 8, so that  it will fit inside the sink. The bench at each side of the sink  should be fluted (Fig. 9), so that the water will drain off into  the sink. A strip should be fixed along the back of the bench as  shown in Figs. 6 and 9, and an arrangement of slats (Fig. 10),  hinged to it, so as to drop on the sink as in Fig. 6, and shown to  a larger scale in Fig. 11.    A shelf for bottles and another for plates, etc., can be fixed  above the developing bench as at D and E (Fig. 6) and another as F  in the same drawing. This latter forms the bottom of the tray  rack, which is fixed on as shown    [Illustration: Details of the Dark Rook]    in Fig. 13. The divisions of the tray rack are best fitted loosely  in grooves formed by fixing strips to the shelves and under the  bench and sink as in Fig. 13.    Extra bearing pieces will be wanted for the shelves mentioned  above, these being shown in Fig. 14. The window is formed by  cutting an opening in the side opposite the door, and fixing in it  a square of white glass with strips of wood on the inside and  putty on the outside, as in Fig. 15. A ruby glass is framed as  shown at G, Fig. 16, and arranged to slide to and fro in the  grooved runners H, which makes it possible to have white light, as  at I, or red light as at K, Fig. 16. The white glass with runners  in position is shown at L in the same drawing, but not the red  glass and frame. Ventilation is arranged for by boring a series of  holes near the floor, as at M, Fig. 6, and near the roof as at N  in the same drawing, and trapping the light without stopping the  passage of air, as shown in the sections, Fig. 17.    The finish of the roof at the gables is shown in Fig. 18, the  strip under the boards holding the felt in position when folded  under, and the same is true of the roll at the top of the roof in  Fig. 19.    The house will be much strengthened if strips, as shown in Fig.  20, are fastened in the corners inside, after lining with brown  paper, screwing them each way into the boards. The door may have a  latch or lock with a knob, but should in addition have two buttons  on the inside, fixed so as to pull it shut tightly at top and  bottom. A waste pipe should be attached to the sink and arranged  to discharge through the floor. A cistern with pipe and tap can be  fastened in the top of the dark room, if desired, or the room may  be made with a flat roof, and a tank stand on it, though this is  hardly advisable.    It is absolutely necessary that the room be well painted, four  coats at first is not too many, and one coat twice a year will  keep it in good condition.    A brick foundation should be laid so that no part of the room  touches the ground.        ** The Versatile Querl [28]    \"Querl\" is the German name for a kitchen utensil which may be used  as an egg-beater, potato-masher or a lemon-squeezer. For beating  up an egg in a glass, mixing flour and water, or stirring cocoa or  chocolate, it is better than anything on the market.    [Illustration: Querl Made of Wood]    This utensil is made of hardwood,  preferably maple or ash. A  circular piece about 2 in. in diameter is cut from 1/2-in. stock  and shaped like a star as shown in Fig. 1, and a 3/8-in. hole  bored in the center for a handle. The handle should be at least 12  in. in length and fastened in the star as shown in Fig. 2.    In use, the star is placed in the dish containing the material to  be beaten or mixed and the handle is rapidly rolled between the  palms of the hands.  --Contributed by W.

If a length of copper wire as large as  the job will permit and sufficiently long to admit being bent at  one end to form a rough handle, and filed or dressed to a point on  the other, is heated and tinned exactly as a regular copper should  be, the work will cause no trouble on account of inaccessibility.  --Contributed by E.

Smith, Eureka Springs, Ark.        ** Smoothing Paper after Erasing [29]    When an ink line is erased the roughened surface of the paper  should be smoothed or polished so as to prevent the succeeding  lines of ink from spreading. A convenient desk accessory for this  purpose can be made of a short    [Illustration: Collar Button Ends In Wood Stick]    piece of hardwood and two bone collar buttons.    File off the head of one button at A and the base from another at  B. Bore a small hole D and E in each end of the wood handle C and  fasten the button parts in the holes with glue or sealing wax. The  handle can be left the shape shown or tapered as desired. The  small end is used for smoothing small erasures and the other end  for larger surfaces.        ** A Cherry Seeder [29]    An ordinary hairpin is driven part way into a small round piece of  wood, about 3/8 in. in diameter and 2 or 2-1/2 in. long, for a  handle, as shown in the sketch. The hairpin should be a very    [Illustration: Hairpin In Stick]    small size. To operate, simply insert the wire loop into the  cherry where the stem has been pulled off and lift out the seed.  --Contributed by L. L.

The tenon or tongue of the joint is  sloping on three surfaces and the mortise is cut sloping to match.  The bottom surface of the mortise is the same width at    [Illustration: Shape of Tenon and Mortise]    both ends, the top being tapering toward the base of the tongue.  --Contributed by Wm. D."]]]
