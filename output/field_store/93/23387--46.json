JJ are water jacket passages for  cooling the air during compression. Owing to the absence of inlet  valves, large water jackets are provided, not only around the cylinder  itself, but through the heads. As the heat of compression is greater  near the end of the stroke, the advantage of a cool head is manifest. H  H are the discharge valves through which the compressed air is forced.    [Illustration: FIG. 16. PISTON INLET VALVE OPERATED BY THE NATURAL LAWS  OF MOMENTUM.]    The most interesting feature of this cylinder is the piston inlet valve.  It is evident that this valve being attached to the piston needs no  springs or other connections, but is opened and closed exactly at the  right time by its natural inertia. With only about 1/4 of an inch throw of  valve a large area is opened, through which the free air is drawn. The  valve is made of a single piece of composition metal and is practically  indestructible. Its construction is such that it fills the clearance  spaces to a greater extent than is usual in air compressors. A singular  feature is that indicator cards taken on these cylinders show a free air  line in some cases a little above the atmospheric line. Poppet valve  compressors almost invariably show a slight vacuum, due to several  causes, mainly the duty performed in compressing the springs of the  valves, but the vacuum is also influenced by insufficiency of valve  area, hot air cylinders, etc. This cylinder gives its full volume of  air, and apparently a little more at times, because the air is admitted  by a concentrated inlet in which free _air is always moving in one  direction_. After it has been started, the speed of the compressor is  such that the air attains a momentum due to its velocity and density;  this serves a useful purpose in piling up the free air in the cylinder  before the inlet valve closes on the return stroke.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--COMBINED STEAM AND AIR INDICATOR CARD:    Taken from a 16x18 Sergeant piston inlet air compressor, meyer's cut-off  at 3/10. Steam at 58 lb.; air pressure, 77 lb.; total engine friction, 5  per cent.]    Fig. 17 illustrates a combined steam and air indicator card taken from  one of these cylinders. It will be observed that with steam and air  cylinders equal in diameter and stroke, an air pressure of 77 pounds is  reached with a steam pressure of only 58 pounds. The reason for this is  plainly shown in the cards, their areas being nearly equal. What is made  up in the air card by high pressure is represented in the steam card by  greater volume. The indicated efficiency deduced from these cards is 95  per cent., that is, the area of the air card divided by the area of the  steam card, representing the resistance divided by the power, results in  95 per cent. While several cards have been taken on the cylinders  showing a loss by friction of only 5 per cent., yet on the average the  best practice shows a loss of 6 per cent. or an efficiency of 94 per  cent. This result indicates an almost perfect proportion between power  and resistance, and good workmanship in air-compressing machinery. It is  difficult to conceive an engine of this size being worked with a less  expenditure for friction than 5 or 6 per cent. Were it possible to  retain the heat which is in the air, and which is represented by the  space between the dotted isothermal curve and the actual curve, we might  attain high efficiency in using compressed air power, but it is evident  that the power represented by the area of this space will be lost by  radiation of heat before it is used in an engine situated several  hundred feet away.    These indicator cards show at a glance that heat is responsible for the  important air losses, and that so far as the design of the compressing  engine is concerned, we have attained a point very near perfection. All  the devices, past, present and future, on which inventors spend so much  time, and in the development of which capitalists are innocently  inveigled, _aim to save this six per cent. loss!_ We hear a good deal  about \"Centrifugal Air Compressors,\" \"Rotaries,\" \"Plunger Pumps,\" etc.,  designs involving expensive complications without any heat advantage,  and which seem to be based upon the \"iridescent dream\" of a large loss  in the present method of compressing air. Here we have a simple engine,  compact and complete in itself, capable of high speed without injury,  constructed on the basis of our best steam engine practice, which  produces compressed air power at a loss of only six per cent.    Clearance is not taken into consideration in the foregoing figures, but  clearance is very much more of a _bete noir_ in theory than in practice.  The early designers, as shown in the \"Dubois-Francois\" illustrations,  Figs. 3 and 4, regarded clearance loss as a very serious matter. Even at  the present time some air compressor manufacturers admit water through  the inlet valves into the air cylinder, not so much for the purpose of  cooling as to fill up the clearance space. A long stroke involving  expensive construction is usually justified by the claim that a large  saving is effected by reduced clearance loss. Let us see what the effect  of this clearance is. Assuming that we have an air compressor which  shows an isothermal pressure line, there would be some loss of power due  to clearance space, because we would have a certain volume of air upon  which work was done and heat produced, that heat having been absorbed  and the air being retained in the cylinder and not serving any useful  purpose. But let us assume that we have a compressor which shows an  adiabatic pressure line. We now have the air in the clearance space  acting precisely as a spring, compressed at each stroke, retaining its  heat of compression, and giving it out against the air piston at the  point when the stroke is reversed. There is no loss of power in such a  case as this, but, on the contrary, the air spring is useful in  overcoming the inertia of the piston and moving parts. The best air  compressors give a result about midway between the isothermal and the  adiabatic, and the net loss of _power_ directly due to clearance is so  small as to be practically unworthy of consideration.    It must not be inferred from the preceding remarks that the designer of  an air compressor may neglect the question of clearance. On the  contrary, it is a very important consideration. If we assume a large  clearance space in the end of an air cylinder of a compressor which is  furnishing air at a high pressure, we may readily conceive that space to  be so large, and that pressure so high, that the entire volume of the  cylinder would be filled by the air from the clearance space alone, and  the compressor would take in no free air and would, of course, produce  no compressed air.    Loss in _capacity_ of air compressors by clearance is in direct  proportion to the pressure.    Owing to the loss of capacity by clearance space at high pressures, it  is important that compound air cylinders should be used for furnishing  air at high pressure. With compound air cylinders the air is compressed  to alternate stages of pressure in the different cylinders, and the  clearance loss is thus reduced because of the reduced density of the air  in the clearance spaces. In ordinary practice air compressors deliver  the air at less than 100 pounds pressure, so that with a properly  designed air cylinder the clearance space is so small that the capacity  of the compressor is not materially affected.    Two systems are in use by which the heat of compression is absorbed, and  the difference between one and the other is so distinct that air  compressors are usually divided into two classes (1) wet compressors,  (2) dry compressors.    A _wet_ compressor is that which introduces water directly into the air  cylinder during compression.    A _dry_ compressor is that which introduces no water into the air during  compression.    _Wet_ compressors may be subdivided into two classes.    (1) Those which inject water in the form of a spray into the cylinder  during compression.    (2) Those which use a water piston for forcing the air into confinement.    The injection of water into the cylinder is usually known as the  Colladon idea. Compressors built on this system have shown the highest  isothermal results, that is, by means of a finely divided spray of cold  water the heat of compression has been absorbed to a point where the  compressed air has been discharged at a temperature nearly equal to that  at which it was admitted to the cylinder. The advantages of water  injection during compression are as follows:    (1) Low temperature of air during compression.    (2) Increased volume of air per stroke, due to filling of clearance  spaces with water and to a cold air cylinder.    (3) Low temperature of air immediately after compression, thus  condensing moisture in the air receiver.    (4) Low temperature of cylinder and valves, thus maintaining packing,  etc.    (5) Economical results, due to compression of moist air (see table 3).

It consists, in fact, of a detached hook, and its  inventor declines to class it with shuttles at all, styling it a detached  hook. It consists of an exterior shell or skeleton of steel, capable of  rotation in an annular raceway. Its detachment from the axis forms a  striking exception to the general construction of interlocking apparatus in  this company's machines. Under the beak of this curious device is found an  oblong recess, into which fits loosely a carrier or driver, rotating with a  differential or variable motion. The space between the carrier and the  sides of the recess is sufficient to permit the free passage of the thread  in encircling the shuttle, and the differential movement ingeniously  releases the contact between the hook and carrier. The skeleton of this  device is only one-sided, and does not really carry its bobbin in the  course of its revolution. The bobbin is placed in a cup-like holder, which  lies within the shuttle or hook body, and is retained in position by a  latch hinged to the bed of the machine. The cup and bobbin are prevented  from partaking of the rotatory movement by a steel spur projecting from the  cup, and fitting loosely into a notch in the latch. Tension upon the under  thread is obtained by passing it under a tension plate upon the bobbin cup.  Twisting of the thread is by these means entirely obviated. In this  apparatus, the disk-like appearance of the bobbin is partially lost in its  considerable breadth, and there is thus a distinct departure from the lines  of the ring shuttles before mentioned. The diagrams exhibit the hook in  several positions during its revolution, and the position of the threads  corresponding thereto.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    _Fixed Rotating Hooks_.--Wilson's rotating hook for lock stitch machines,  and Gribbs' hook for single thread machines, are both well known. In the  year 1872, the Wheeler & Wilson company introduced a new hook, forming an  improvement upon Wilson's original device (Fig. 3). Its chief peculiarity  consists in the extension of the termination of the periphery, forming a  long tail piece, quite overlapping the point, and serving as a guard, both  to keep off the bobbin thread and to prevent collision between bobbin and  needle.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    This improved class of hooks are provided with a much deeper cavity than  those first introduced, an arrangement permitting of the employment of a  more commodious bobbin, which is generally covered by a cap, as in the  revolving shuttle, but free to revolve. In some cases the cap carries a  tension plate preventing its revolution with the hook. But beyond these  improvements on Wilson's original device, the utility of the hook mainly  depends upon two things quite apart from the hook itself. These are the  dispensing with the old fashioned check brush and the use of a positive  take-up.    Thus, in the original machine, the stitch was pulled up by the succeeding  revolution of the hook. For while one revolution sufficed to cast it over  the spool, a second turn was requisite to complete the stitch. In this way,  to make a first stitch with such an apparatus required two turns of the  rotating hook. The improvements mentioned enable the machine to complete a  stitch with one turn of the hook--an important step in advance, when we  consider that by the old method each length of slack thread must be  tightened up solely through the fabric and the needle eye. But this  particular arrangement bears so much upon the introduction of the positive  take-up itself that further reference to it must be reserved until that  device has been described.    _Simple Thread Hooks_.--The best known of these is Willcox & Gibbs. It has  been so often described, that no further reference to it may be made. It  continues to make the same excellent twisted stitch as it produced  twenty-five years ago.    _Of Vibrating Shuttles_.--These are shuttles of the long description,  moving in a segment of a circle. There are several varieties. The most  novel machine of this kind is the vibrating shuttle machine just produced  by the Singer Manufacturing Company. In this case the shuttle itself  consists of a steel tube, into the open end of which the wound reel is  dropped, and is free to revolve quite loosely. Variation of tension is thus  obviated in a very simple manner. The chief point of interest in the  machine is undoubtedly the means employed in transferring the motion from  the main shaft to the underneath parts, an arrangement as ingenious and  effective as any device ever introduced into stitching mechanism. It is the  invention of Mr. Robert Whitehall, and consists of a vertical rocking shaft  situated in the arm of the machine Motion is imparted to it by means of an  elbow formed upon the main shaft acting upon two arms, called wipers,  projecting from the rocking shaft, the angle formed by the arms exactly  coinciding with that of the elbow in its revolution. This admirable motion  will no doubt attract much attention from mechanists and engineers.    _The Lock Stitch from Two Reels_.--In the early days of the sewing machine,  the makers of it often met with the question, \"Why do you use a shuttle at  all? Can you not invent a method of working from a reel direct?\" The  questioner generally means a reel placed upon a pin, just as the upper reel  is placed. The reply to such a query is, of course, that to produce the  lock stitch in that way is impossible--as indeed it is.    But many ingenious machinists have pondered long over the problem, and  several clever contrivances have been invented with a view to its solution.  It may scarcely be necessary to say that the best manufacturers of sewing  machines have conducted experiments with the same object in view, and the  result has always been a return to the shuttle, with its steel bobbins.    Why is this, and how is it that a very big shuttle cannot be used, large  enough, indeed, to accommodate any bobbin within itself? The answer is very  simple. It has been done over and over again.    Since the whole bulk of the under thread must pass through the loop of the  upper one, it, is quite clear that the size of that loop must be  proportioned to the bulk of the shuttle. Thus, a small shuttle would,  perhaps, be covered by an inch of thread, while our supposed mammoth  shuttle might require ten times that amount. Now, let us consider that to  sew an inch of thread into lock stitches frequently involves its being  drawn up and down through both needle and fabric twenty times. This means  considerable chafing, and possible injury to the thread.    But if we were to sanction the use of capacious shuttles, ten inches of  thread must undergo this chafing and seesaw treatment, and under the above  conditions every part of the ten inches must pass up and down two hundred  times--treatment that might reasonably be expected to leave little \"life\"  in the thread. But in spite of this tremendous drawback, there are machines  offered for sale made with such shuttles.    For reasons that I have now pointed out, it is quite clear that a large  shuttle or bobbin is by no means an unmixed advantage. Indeed, the very  best makers of sewing machines have always striven to keep down the bulk of  the shuttle, and in those splendid machines shown here to-night the use of  the small shuttles is conspicuous. It may be contended that small bobbins  frequently require refilling, which is quite true, but the saving of the  thread effected thereby, not to mention that of the machine itself, amply  compensates for the use of small shuttles. Apart from this, however, it is  no longer necessary to wind bobbins at all. Dewhurst & Sons, of Skipton,  and Clark & Co., of Paisley, have produced ready wound \"cops\" or bobbins of  thread for placing direct into shuttles. Thus no winding of bobbins is  necessary, and indeed the bobbins themselves are dispensed with. I believe  that the slightly increased cost of the thread thus wound is the only  present bar to the extensive introduction of ready wound \"cops.\"    _Of Thread Controllers_.--One of the earliest difficulties encountered by  the maker of a sewing machine was that of effectually controlling the loose  thread after it had been cast off the shuttle. In some machines this slack  thread amounts to six, in others to one or two inches. Howe got over the  difficulty by passing his thread, on its way to the needle, over the upper  extremity of the needle bar--the ascent of the bar, then, sufficed to pull  up the slack. Singer improved upon this by furnishing his machine with a  spring take-up lever, partially controlled by the needle bar.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    Wilson, in the Wheeler-Wilson machine, had neither of those arrangements,  but depended upon the succeeding revolution of the hook to draw up the  slack of the preceding stitch. These devices were all far from perfect in  their operation, chiefly because they commenced to act too soon. In each  case the pulling up commenced with the rise of the needle, and the  tightening operation subjected the thread to all the friction of rubbing  its way through both needle eye and fabric. Now, an ideal take-up should  not commence to act until the needle has ascended above the fabric, and one  of the most important steps toward perfection in sewing machines was  undoubtedly attained when such a device was actually invented. In effecting  this, the means employed consists of a differential or variable cam,  rotating with the main shaft. This controls the movements of a lever called  the take-up, pivoted to the machine (Fig. 4). Not only has it been  possible by these means to control the tightening of the stitch, but the  paying out of the thread for enveloping the shuttle also, and both the  paying out and pulling up are actually effected after the needle has  ascended above the cloth.
