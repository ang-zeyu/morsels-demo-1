Having humbled the Brahmans, Krishna now turns to the gods, choosing  Indra, their chief, for attack. The moment is his annual worship when the  cowherds offer sweets, rice, saffron, sandal and incense. Seeing them  busy, Krishna asks Nanda what is the point of all their preparations. What  good can Indra really do? he asks. He is only a god, not God himself. He  is often worsted by demons and abjectly put to flight. In fact he has no  power at all. Men prosper because of their virtues or their fates, not  because of Indra. As cowherds, their business is to carry on agriculture  and trade and to tend cows and Brahmans. Their earliest books, the Vedas,  require them not to abandon their family customs and Krishna then cites as  an ancient practice the custom of placating the spirits of the forests and  hills. This custom, he says, they have wrongly superseded in favour of  Indra and they must now revive it. Nanda sees the force of Krishna's  remarks and holds a meeting. 'Do not brush aside his words as those of a  mere boy,' he says. 'If we face the facts, we have really nothing to do  with the ruler of the gods. It is on the forests, rivers and the great  hill, Govardhana, that we really depend.' The cowherds applaud this  advice, resolve to abandon the gods and in their place to worship the  mountain, Govardhana. The worship of the hill is then performed. Krishna  advises the cowherds to shut their eyes and the spirit of the hill will  then show itself. He then assumes the spirit's form himself, telling Nanda  and the cowherds that in response to their worship the mountain spirit has  appeared. The cowherds' eyes are easily deceived. Beholding, as they  think, Govardhana himself, they make offerings and go rejoicing home.    Such an act of defiance greatly enrages Indra and he assembles all the  gods. He forgets that earlier in the story it was the gods themselves who  begged Vishnu to be born on earth and that many of their number have even  taken birth as cowherds and cowgirls in order to delight in Krishna as  his incarnation. Instead he sees Krishna as 'a great talker, a silly  unintelligent child and very proud.' He scoffs at the cowherds for  regarding Krishna as a god, and in order to reinstate himself he orders  the clouds to rain down torrents. The cowherds, faced with floods on every  side, appeal to Krishna. Krishna, however, is fully alive to the position.  He calms their fears and raising the hill Govardhana, supports it on his  little finger.[26] The cowherds and cattle take shelter under it and  although Indra himself comes and pours down rain for seven days, Braj and  its inhabitants stay dry. Indra is compelled to admit that Vishnu has  indeed descended in the form of Krishna and retires to his abode. Krishna  then sets the hill down in its former place. Following this discomfiture,  Indra comes down from the sky accompanied by his white elephant and by  Surabhi, the cow of plenty. He offers his submission to Krishna, is  pardoned and returns.    All these events bring to a head the problem which has been exercising  the cowherds for long--who and what is Krishna? Obviously no simple boy  could lift the mountain on his finger. He must clearly be someone much  greater and they conclude that Krishna can only be Vishnu himself. They  accordingly beseech him to show them the paradise of Vishnu. Krishna  agrees, creates a paradise and shows it to them. The cowherds see it and  praise his name. Yet it is part of the story that these flashes of insight  should be evanescent--that having realized one instant that Krishna is  God, the cowherds should regard him the next instant as one of themselves.  Having revealed his true nature, therefore, Krishna becomes a cowherd once  again and is accepted by the cowherds as being only that.    One further incident must be recorded. In compliance with a vow, Nanda  assembles the cowherds and cowgirls and goes to the shrine of Devi, the  Earth Mother, to celebrate Krishna's twelfth birthday. There they make  lavish offerings of milk, curds and butter and thank the goddess for  protecting Krishna for so long. Night comes on and they camp near the  shrine. As Nanda is sleeping, a huge python begins to swallow his foot.[27]  Nanda calls to Krishna, who hastens to his rescue. Logs are taken from  a fire, but as soon as the snake is touched by Krishna, a handsome young  man emerges and stands before him with folded hands. He explains that he  was once the celestial dancer, Sudarsana who in excess of pride drove his  chariot backwards and forwards a hundred times over the place where a  holy man was meditating. As a consequence he was cursed and told to  become a python until Krishna came and released him. To attract Krishna's  attention he has seized the foot of Nanda. Krishna bids him go and,  ascending his chariot, Sudarsana returns to the gods.    The _Purana_ now returns to Krishna's encounters with the cowgirls, their  passionate longings and ardent desire to have him as their lover. Since  the incident at the river, they have been waiting for him to keep his  promise. Krishna, however, has appeared blandly indifferent--going to the  forest, playing with the cowherds but coldly ignoring the cowgirls  themselves. When autumn comes, however, the beauty of the nights stirs his  feelings. Belatedly he recalls his promise and decides to fulfil it. That  night his flute sounds in the forest, its notes reaching the ears of the  cowgirls and thrilling them to the core. Like girls in tribal India today,  they know it is a call to love. They put on new clothes, brush aside their  husbands, ignore the other members of their families and hurry to the  forest. As they arrive, Krishna stands superbly before them. He wears a  crown of peacocks' feathers and a yellow dhoti and his blue-black skin  shines in the moonlight. As the cowgirls throng to see him, he twits them  on their conduct. Are they not frightened at coming into the dark forest?  What are they doing abandoning their families? Is not such wild behaviour  quite unbefitting married girls? Should not a married girl obey her  husband in all things and never for a moment leave him? Having enjoyed the  deep forest and the moonlight, let them return at once and soothe their  injured spouses. The cowgirls are stunned to hear such words, hang their  heads, sigh and dig their toes into the ground. They begin to weep and at  last turn on Krishna, saying 'Oh! why have you deceived us so? It was your  flute that made us come. We have left our husbands for you. We live for  your love. Where are we to go?' 'If you really love me,' Krishna answers  'Dance and sing with me.' His words fill the cowgirls with delight and  surrounding Krishna 'like golden creepers growing on a dark-coloured  hill,' they go with him to the banks of the Jumna. Here Krishna has  conjured up a golden circular terrace ornamented with pearls and diamonds  and cooled by sprouting plantains. The moon pours down, saturating the  forest. The cowgirls' joy increases. They beautify their bodies and then,  wild with love, join with Krishna in singing and dancing. Modesty deserts  them and they do whatever pleases them, regarding Krishna as their lover.  As the night goes on, Krishna 'appears as beautiful as the moon amidst the  stars.'    As the cowgirls' ecstasies proceed, Krishna feels that they are fast  exceeding themselves. They think that he is in their power and are already  swelling with pride. He decides therefore to leave them suddenly, and  taking a single girl with him vanishes from the dance.[28] When they find  him gone, the cowgirls are at a loss to know what to do. 'Only a moment  ago,' one of them says, 'Krishna's arms were about my neck, and now he has  gone.' They begin to comb the forest, anxiously asking the trees, birds  and animals, for news. As they go, they recall Krishna's many winning  ways, his sweetnesses of character, his heart-provoking charms and begin  to mimic his acts--the slaying of Putana, the quelling of Kaliya, the  lifting of the hill Govardhana. One girl imitates Krishna dancing and  another Krishna playing. In all these ways they strive to evoke his  passionately-desired presence. At length they discover Krishna's  footprints and a little farther on those of a woman beside them. They  follow the trail which leads them to a bed of leaves and on the leaves  they find a looking-glass. 'What was Krishna doing with this?' they ask.  'He must have taken it with him,' a cowgirl answers, 'so that while he  braided his darling's hair, she could still perceive his lovely form.' And  burning with love, they continue looking.    While they are searching, the particular cowgirl who has gone with Krishna  is tempted to take liberties. Thinking Krishna is her slave, she complains  of feeling tired and asks him to carry her on his shoulders. Krishna  smiles, sits down and asks her to mount. But as she puts out her hands, he  vanishes and she remains standing with hands outstretched.[29] Tears stream  from her eyes. She is filled with bitter grief and cries 'O Krishna! best  of lovers, where have you gone? Take pity.'    As she is bemoaning her fate, her companions arrive.[30] They put their  arms around her, comfort her as best they can, and then, taking her with  them, continue through the moonlight their vain and anguished search.  Krishna still evades them and they return to the terrace where the night's  dancing had begun. There they once again implore Krishna to have pity,  declaring that there is none like him in charm, that he is endlessly  fascinating and that in all of them he has aroused extremities of  passionate love. But the night is empty, their cries go unanswered, and  moaning for the Krishna they adore, they toss and writhe on the ground."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11930"],[0,"More Fables (#8)"],[1,"Rattlers, and laid out at Winona.\"    The English Tourist was holding his Head.    \"I guess you won't carry on so Gay since he's come,\" said the Sensitive  Waitress, addressing the Advance Agent.    \"Did he Call you Down?\" asked Edmund, the Loving Fireman, glancing at  the Advance Agent.    \"He used me like I was the Dirt under his Feet,\" she replied, placing  her Hand on her Breast and biting her Lower Lip.    \"Well, it's a Good Thing,\" said Edmund. \"You've needed a few of them  Jolts ever since you had your Hand read by the Gypsy and started to read  that Bertha Clay Book.

MORAL: _Brothers in Name only._          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ LODGE FIEND, _AND THE_ DELILAH TRICK PLAYED _BY_  HIS WIFE      A Woman who had done nothing to Deserve it was the Wife of a Joiner. He  was the K.G. of one Benevolent Order and the Worshipful High Guy of  something else, and the Senior Warden of the Sons of Patoosh, and a lot  more that she couldn't keep track of.    When he got on all of his Pins he had Sousa put away.    Night after Night he was off to a Hall up a Dark Stairway to land some  Unfortunate into the Blue Lodge or the Commandery or else Over the Hot  Sands.    He carried at least twenty Rituals in his Head, and his Hands were all  twisted out of Shape from giving so many different Grips.    In the Morning when he came out of the House he usually found some one  waiting on the Door-Step to give him the Sign of Distress and work the  fraternal Pan-Handle on him. He subscribed for the Magazines that were  full of these sparkling Chapter Reports, and after that, if he had not  spent all his money going to Conclaves and Grand Lodge Meetings, he paid  Dues and Assessments and bought Uniforms. He had one Suit in particular,  with Frogs and Cords and Gold Braid strung around over the Front of it,  and then a Helmet with about a Bushel of Red Feathers. When he got into  this Rig and strapped on his Jeweled Sword he wouldn't have traded  Places with Nelson A. Miles.    His Wife often said that he ought not to leave her and take up with a  Goat, and that she could use on Groceries some of the Coin that he was  devoting to Velvet Regalia and Emblematic Watch-Charms, but he always  tried to make it Right with her by explaining that he had Insurance in  most of these Whispering Organizations, so that she and the Children  would come in for a whole Wad of Money. The Wife thought it was too long  to wait. He seemed to be in a Fair Way to live another Century and keep  on paying Assessments.    There was no use in Arguing with him. When a Man gets to be a confirmed  Joiner he is not Happy unless he can get into an unlighted Room two or  three Nights a Week, and wallop the Neophyte with a Stuffed Club, and  walk him into a Tub of Water, and otherwise Impress him with the  Solemnity of the Ordeal.    The real Joiner loves to sit up on an elevated Throne, wearing a Bib and  holding a dinky Gavel, and administer a blistering Oath to the Wanderer  who seeks the Privilege of helping to pay the Rent.    To a Man who does not cut very many Lemons around his own House, where  they are Onto him, it is a great Satisfaction to get up in a Lodge Hall  and put on a lot of Ceremonial Dog, and have the Members kneel in front  of him and Salute him as the Exalted Sir Knight.    [Illustration: THE JOINER]    You take a Man who is Plugging along on a Salary, and who has to answer  the 'Phone and wrap up Tea all Day, and let him go out at Night and be  an Exalted Sir, and it helps him to feel that he isn't such a Nine-Spot  after all.    Now this particular Joiner wanted to be up on a carpeted Dais every  blessed Evening, having the Brothers march in front of him and give him  the High Office. His Wife, being unacquainted with the Secrets of the  Lodge Room, was unable to understand why he was so Fascinated with the  Life. She was exceedingly Inquisitive and often tried to Pump him by the  most Artful Methods, but of course he did not dare to Divulge or his  Right Arm would have Withered and his Tongue would have Cleaved to the  Roof of his Mouth, and he would have been an Outcast on the Face of the  Earth, despised by all other Members of the Royal Tararum. Now and then  he Talked in his Sleep, and she caught Expressions in regard to Branding  him on the Other Leg or putting him back into the Coffin, and her  Curiosity was intensified.    One day she read in a Veracious Newspaper that if the Left Hand of a  Sleeping Person be immersed in Tepid Water, then the Sleeper will  truthfully answer any Question that may be asked. She resolved to try it  on her Husband. She was dying to know what they Said and Did at Lodge  Meetings that would keep a Man away from Home so many Nights in the  Week.    That Night after he had come home from the Odd Fellows and passed into  Slumber she crept out and took a Low Advantage of him. She slid his Left  Hand into a bowl of Warm Water without arousing him, and he Gave Up. He  told all the Passwords, the Secret Mottoes, the Oaths, the Meaning of  the Symbols and the Unwritten Work. When he had finished she had a  Notion to Ring for a Night Cab and go Home to her own Family, but her  Better Judgment prevailed. She concluded that she would have to continue  to Live with him, no matter what she Thought of him.    She never dared to tell that she Knew, and he never Suspected. Husband  never guessed why it was that when he started out for an Evening with  the Skeletons and the Candidates she stood back and smiled at him more  in Pity than in Anger.    MORAL: _It's a Good Thing they don't Know_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ APPREHENSIVE SPARROW _AND_ HER DAILY ESCAPE      Once there was a Proper little Female who Fluttered and was interested  in Movements. She was born the Year that Fremont ran against Buchanan.  All she knew about Spooning was what she had Read in Ella Wheeler  Wilcox. Time and again she said that if a Man ever attempted to Take  Liberties with her, she knew she would Die of Mortification. At Last  Reports she was Living, but she had Courted Death at least Fifteen  Hundred Times.    If a Strange Man came up behind her while she was walking Homeward in  the Dusk, she always gave a Timid Glance behind and Hurried, suspecting  that he would Overtake her and seize her by both Wrists and tell her not  to Scream. She would reach her own Door and lean against it, almost in a  Swoon, and the Strange Man would pass by, softly Humming to Himself.    Occasionally an Adventurer with Coal-Black Eyes and a Suspicious Manner  would come and sit right beside her in a Car, evidently for some  Purpose, and she would close her Lips tightly and resolve to do a Steve  Brodie out of the Window if she saw his Hand slipping over toward Hers.  Fortunately, the man kept his Eyes on the Sporting Page and made no  Move.    If she happened to be in the Waiting-Room at the Station, and a coarse  but masterful Claim Agent, or some one else equally Terrifying, happened  to come across the Room at her, she could feel her Little Heart stand  still, and she would say, \"This is where I get it.\" After he had gone  past, on his way to the Check-Room, she would put some Camphor on her  Handkerchief and declare to Goodness that never again would she start  out to Travel unless she had some Older Person with her.    [Illustration: THE SPARROW]    More than once when she was at Home, with only a few other Persons  around the House, she saw a Large Man come up the Front Steps, and she  would be Frozen with Terror, and could see herself being lifted into a  Closed Carriage by the Brutal Confederates. She would slip a Pair of  Scissors under her Apron and creep to the Front Door, prepared to Resist  with all her Girlish Strength, and the Man would have to talk to her  through the Door, and ask where they wanted the Coal delivered.    Now and then a Caller would find her Reviving herself with a Cup of Tea.    The Caller would say: \"Madge, Child, you are as Pale as a Ghost.\"    Madge would reply: \"Oh, I have just had such a Turn! I was out watering  the Nasturtiums, when a Man in a Crash Suit came along the Street and  looked right at me. The Gate was open, and there was nothing to prevent  him from coming right in and Getting me.\"    The Appalled Visitor would want to know what became of him, and Madge  would explain that he turned at the Next Corner, and she had been as  Weak as a Cat ever since.    On her Shopping Expeditions she noticed Dozens of Men, apparently  Trailing right along after her, and she knew that her only Salvation was  to look straight ahead and indicate by her Bearing that she was no  Flirt. By so doing she eluded many a one who wanted to Catch Step with  her and begin a Conversation.    The Collected Stories of her Successful but Hair-Breadth Escapes from"]]]
