But as all forearms are not of equal length, much delay was occasioned  by the sultan trying the length of his forearm against everybody's in  the room, and then by measuring every cloth by turn, and remeasuring  them again for fear of mistake; then they were divided into lots, to  be disposed of to his wives, and children and Akils and servants, and,  of course, found insufficient to meet everybody's expectations, and I  must give more.    Tedious hours passed in this way; as a final petition, the sultan said  I must give him for himself a gun and my silk turban, as I had given  up wearing anything on my head, and did not require it: these were,  after a certain amount of haggling, surrendered, on condition that the  sultan would exert himself a little more energetically on my account.  The way he handled the musket was very amusing: he had never had one  in his hands before, and could not get it to sit against his shoulder;  and when his people placed it for him, he persisted in always cocking  the wrong eye, which tickled Farhan's fancy so much, that he burst  into loud roars of laughter. Nevertheless, the sultan took things  quietly, and would not allow himself to be discomposed, but coolly  said the gun would be of no use unless I gave him some powder to feed  it with. This last straw broke the camel's back; all things must have  an end, and I promised I would give him some after he procured enough  camels for my wants, but not before. This settled the matter, and he  walked off, with all the things I had given him, as sulkily as if he  had been injured.    Camels were then brought for sale, and purchasing commenced. When the  sultan was present, he had to determine if the prices asked by the  sellers were reasonable or not, and took for his office as mediator a  tithe on all purchases; but in his absence, Akils were appointed to  officiate on the same conditions. This system of robbing, I was  assured, was the custom of the country, and if I wanted to buy at all  I must abide by it. Cloth was at a great discount on the coast, for  the men there had, by their dealings with Aden, become accustomed to  handle dollars, and were in consequence inspired with that superior  innate love for the precious metal over all other materials, with  which all men, and especially those newly acquainted with it, become  unaccountably possessed. No one would believe that my boxes could be  made for any other purpose than for locking up money; and I was  obliged to leave them open to inspection before they would sell  anything for cloth.[14]    The sultan now lived at Bunder Gori, and seldom showed himself,  promising to come to me every day, without the least intention of  doing so; and only at last, after three days' absence, when I  threatened to invade his dwelling, did he appear, bringing several  camels with him: of these I purchased some good ones, and sent the  rest away: this was the 15th November. He then returned home again,  and promised faithfully he would bring on the morrow a sufficient  number of camels to carry all my kit.    16th.--For the first time the sultan kept his promise by returning,  but the animals he brought were weak and useless, and I could plainly  see I was being trifled with, and detained here for the mere purpose  of being robbed in an indirect manner, so that no accusation could be  laid against any one. Nothing, I may say, in all my experiences, vexes  the mind so much as feeling one's self injured in a way that cannot be  prevented or avenged. Some might take such matters quietly, but I  confess I could not. Indeed, I stormed and expostulated with the  sultan until he agreed to assist me in a move. I had now eleven  camels, and wanted some five more, but thought it better not to wait;  for as long as I remained in a comfortable dwelling, I knew my men  would not exert themselves. That day, then, packing up what I most  required, I started for Bunder Gori, and unloaded, after a three  miles' march, at an old well in rear of the village, selecting as a  camping-ground the least comfortable place I could find, and not  allowing the tent to be pitched, though the sun-heat was 112 degrees,  and the sand was blowing in perfect clouds. Some days previous to my  leaving Goriat, Sumunter induced me to give him twenty rupees to hire  donkeys for conveying the heavier things over the hills, and  repeatedly assured me he had got them, but they never came; and now I  asked him to return the money, as I had brought it with me as a  reserve fund, to provide against any possible difficulty, and not to  be parted with for any ordinary purpose. This commenced a series of  rows between Sumunter and myself: he had made away with the money, and  could not produce it. The salt also was never forthcoming.    17th.--I could not succeed in making up my complement of camels. The  sultan said he and his men must be fed before they could do work, and  sat upon the date-bags so resolutely I was fain to open them that some  business might be done. After feasting they all dispersed, under  pretence of bringing other camels, and I went into the town to inspect  the place. There were five small forts, occupied by merchants, of whom  one was a Hindi from Cutch, and a large collection of mat huts, mostly  occupied by women. Instead of finding a harbour (Bunder), as the name  of the village implied, the shore was a gradual shelving open  roadstead, in which two buggaloes were lying at anchor, waiting for  cargoes, and four small sailing-boats were preparing, with harpoon and  tackle, to go porpoise-hunting for oil.    18th.--Having made everybody as uncomfortable as I could wish, sitting  in the sandy open plain, all the men were equally desirous with myself  for a move on the journey; but still I was five camels short, and saw  no hopes of getting them. The plan then settled was to move southwards  half-way up the hill, leaving the few things still in the fort as they  were, until I arrived at the camping-place, and could send the animals  I was taking with me back to fetch them. Having now desired the  sultan, Sumunter, and Farhan to return to Goriat, and leave the rear  property in safe custody with the fort-keeper, I commenced the march  across the maritime plain with Ahmed, Imam, a number of Somali  camel-tenders armed with spear and bow, and the sultan's youngest son,  Abdullah, to direct the way until his father and the other two should  arrive, which they promised they would do by the evening. The track  first led us across the maritime plain, here about two miles broad,  and composed of sand overlying limestone, with boulders in the dry  shallow watercourses, and with no vegetable life save a few scrub  acacias and certain salsola. This traversed, we next wound along a  deep ravine called Tug (river) Tura,[15] lying between the lower spurs  of the mountain-range, and commenced a slight ascent up its cracked,  uneven passage, until we reached a halting-place called Iskodubuk. The  distance we had made was only about five miles from Bunder Gori, but  the camels were so fatigued by travelling over boulders, that we were  obliged to unload and stop there for the day. The sultan and Abban now  overtook us to say that the rear things were in safe custody in the  fort; and, leaving instructions with the young Prince Abdullah about  the road we should follow on the morrow, returned _nolens volens_ back  to Bunder Gori, saying, as they went away, we might expect them at the  next camping-ground as soon even as we could get there with the  camels. A little after sunset, some interesting rock-pigeons--very  similar to the Indian painted bird, which I found there frequenting  ground much of the same nature--lit at some pools in the bed of the  ravine, and enabled me to shoot and stuff several of them.    19th.--We got under way in the early morning, and commenced ascending  the same ravine, when a messenger from the sultan arrived, and desired  we would stop until he came. We had scarcely accomplished two miles,  and the morning was yet young and cool, and I strove with every effort  in my power to induce the men to go a little further forward, but  without the slightest effect; they were as obstinate as mules, and  just as unruly. This was a fair specimen of Somali travelling; any  pretext to save the trouble of moving is accounted too precious to be  lost. The ground here was a little more wooded; tall slender trees,  with thick green foliage, grew in the bed of the ravine, in which  there were some occasional pools of stagnant rain-water, and the brown  rocky hill-sides were decorated with budding bush acacias, which  afforded a good repast for the weary camels, whose journey over the  boulders must have been very fatiguing to them.    20th.--As the sultan did not arrive, and the young prince would not  allow my men to load, I ordered the interpreter and Imam to remain  where they were, whilst I returned to Bunder Gori to see what was the  matter, and on no account were they to issue any food until I came  back again. As soon as I had gone two or three miles, I found the  young prince and all the camel-men hastening after me, and entreating  me to return; they said the sultan was on his way, and would arrive in  camp in the evening. I complied, conditionally that they bound  themselves to march in the morning whether he came or not. Once again  in camp, I had my food prepared, and sat savagely watching the effect  its odour had upon my starving men, who, fearing they would get none,  formed in a body, and came petitioning me to forgive them, as they  consented to do my bidding for ever after. They were then fed.    21st.--After loading in the morning, with a great deal of beating and  thumping, all the camels, save two or three weakly ones, were whipped  up a winding steep ridge, one of the buttresses of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#7)"],[1,"        [Clark, June 7, 1804]  Thursday 7th of June 1804 Set out early passed the head of the Isd from  the Isd.
