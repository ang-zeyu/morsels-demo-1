The peculiar advantage of this humble criticism, in dramatic  compositions, is obvious. Alfieri himself, as he informs us, did not  disdain to resort to it.    Moliere was naturally of a reserved and taciturn temper; insomuch that  his friend Boileau used to call him the _Contemplateur_. Strangers who  had expected to recognise in his conversation the sallies of wit which  distinguished his dramas, went away disappointed. The same thing is  related of La Fontaine. The truth is, that Moliere went into society as a  spectator, not as an actor; he found there the studies for the  characters, which he was to transport upon the stage; and he occupied  himself with observing them. The dreamer, La Fontaine, lived too in a  world of his own creation. His friend, Madame de la Sabliere, paid to him  this untranslateable compliment; \"En verite, mon cher La Fontaine, vous  seriez bien bete, si vous n'aviez pas tant d'esprit.\" These unseasonable  reveries brought him, it may be imagined, into many whimsical adventures.  The great Corneille, too, was distinguished by the same apathy. A  gentleman dined at the same table with him for six months, without  suspecting the author of the \"Cid.\"    Moliere enjoyed the closest intimacy with the great Conde, the most  distinguished ornament of the court of Louis the Fourteenth; to such an  extent indeed, that the latter directed, that the poet should never be  refused admission to him, at whatever hour he might choose to pay his  visit. His regard for his friend was testified by his remark, rather more  candid than courteous, to an Abbe of his acquaintance, who had brought  him an epitaph, of his own writing, upon the deceased poet. \"Would to  heaven,\" said the prince, \"that he were in a condition to bring me  yours.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DOMESTIC HABITS OF NAPOLEON.      At nine o'clock the emperor came out of his sleeping apartments, dressed  for the whole day. First the officers on duty were admitted, and received  their orders for the day. Then the _grandes entrees_ and the officers of  the household not on duty were introduced; and if any one had any  particular communication to make, he staid till the public audience was  concluded. At half after nine o'clock Napoleon breakfasted, on a small  mahogany table with one leg, and covered with a napkin. The prefect of  the palace stood close by this table, with his hat under his arm. The  breakfast rarely lasted beyond eight minutes. Sometimes, however, men of  science or literature, or distinguished artists, were admitted at this  time, with whom Napoleon is represented to have conversed in an easy and  lively style. Amongst these were M. Monge, Costaz, Denon, Bertholet,  Corvisart, David, Gerard, Isabey, Talma, and Fontaine. Dinner was served  at six o'clock; the emperor and the empress dined alone on the common  days of the week, but on Sunday all the imperial family attended, upon  which occasion Napoleon, the empress, and Madame Mere had arm-chairs, and  the rest chairs without arms. There was only one course. The emperor  drank no wine but Chambertin, and that usually mixed with water. Dinner  lasted in general from fifteen to twenty minutes. All this time the  prefect of the palace had to superintend the affair _en grand_, and to  answer any questions put to him. In the drawing-room a page presented to  the emperor a waiter with a cup and a sugar-stand. Le chef d'office  poured out the coffee; the empress took the cup from the emperor; the  page and the chef d'office retired; the prefect waited till the empress  had poured the coffee into the saucer and given it to Napoleon. After  this the emperor went to his papers again, and the empress played at  cards. Sometimes he would come and talk a little while with the people of  the household in the apartments of the empress, but not often, and he  never staid long. Upon his retiring, the officers on duty attended the  audience _du coucher_, and received their orders for the morrow. This was  the ordinary economy of the emperor's time, when not with the army.    Napoleon read the English newspapers every day in French, and M. de  Bausset says the translation was rigorously exact. One day in January,  1811, the emperor gave some of these extracts to de B., and ordered him  to read them aloud during dinner. The prefect got on pretty well, till he  stumbled at some uncouth epithets, with which he was puzzled how to deal,  especially in the presence of the empress, and a room full of domestics.  He blew his nose, and skipped the words--\"No!\" said Napoleon, \"read out!  you will find many more.\" \"I should be wanting--\" \"Read, I tell you,\"  repeated the emperor, \"read every thing!\" At last de B. ran upon \"tyrant  or despot,\" which he commuted for \"emperor.\" Napoleon caught the paper  out of his hands, read the real phrase aloud, and then ordered M. de B.  to continue. These translations used to be made by Maret, Duke of  Bassano.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.      \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"                                   SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *      RETENTIVE MEMORY.      The historian, Fuller, in 1607, had a most retentive memory; he could  repeat 500 strange, unconnected words, after twice hearing them; and a  sermon verbatim, after reading it once. He undertook, after passing from  Temple Bar to the farthest part of Cheapside and back again, to mention  all the signs over the shops on both sides of the streets, repeated them  backwards and forwards, and performed the task with great exactness.

About two miles northward of Djidda is shown the tomb of Howa (Eve), the  mother of mankind; it is, as I was informed, a rude structure of stone,  about four feet in length, two or three feet in height, and as many in  breadth; thus resembling the tomb of Noah, seen in the valley of Bekaa,  in Syria--_Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia_.           *       *       *       *       *      ACROSTIC ON THE EYES.

It is found  by experience that these colours are significant. The vibration which  denotes the power of unselfish affection shows itself as a pale  rose-colour; that which indicates high intellectual power is yellow; that  which expresses sympathy is green, while blue betokens devotional feeling,  and a luminous lilac-blue typifies the higher spirituality. The same scheme  of colour-significance applies to the bodies which are built of denser  matter, but as we approach the physical world the hues are in every case by  comparison grosser--not only less delicate but also less living.    In the course of evolution in the lower worlds man often introduces into  his vehicles qualities which are undesirable and entirely inappropriate for  his life as an ego--such, for example, as pride, irritability, sensuality.  These, like the rest, are reducible to vibrations, but they are in all  cases vibrations of the lower subdivisions of their respective worlds, and  therefore they cannot reproduce themselves in the causal body, which is  built exclusively of the matter of the three higher subdivisions of its  world. For each section of the astral body acts strongly upon the  corresponding section of the mental body, but only upon the corresponding  section; it cannot influence any other part. So the causal body can be  affected only by the three higher portions of the astral body; and the  oscillations of those represent only good qualities.    The practical effect of this is that the man can build into the ego (that  is, into his true self) nothing but good qualities; the evil qualities  which he develops are in their nature transitory and must be thrown aside  as he advances, because he has no longer within him matter which can  express them. The difference between the causal bodies of the savage and  the saint is that the first is empty and colourless, while the second is  full of brilliant, coruscating tints. As the man passes beyond even  saint-hood and becomes a great spiritual power, his causal body increases  in size, because it has so much more to express, and it also begins to pour  out from itself in all directions powerful rays of living light. In one who  has attained Adeptship this body is of enormous dimensions.    The mental body is built of matter of the four lower subdivisions of the  mental world, and expresses the concrete thoughts of the man. Here also we  find the same colour-scheme as in the causal body. The hues are somewhat  less delicate, and we notice one or two additions. For example, a thought  of pride shows itself as orange, while irritability is manifested by a  brilliant scarlet. We may see here sometimes the bright brown of avarice,  the grey-brown of selfishness, and the grey-green of deceit. Here also we  perceive the possibility of a mixture of colours; the affection, the  intellect, the devotion may be tinged by selfishness, and in that case  their distinctive colours are mingled with the brown of selfishness, and so  we have an impure and muddy appearance. Although its particles are always  in intensely rapid motion among themselves, this body has at the same time  a kind of loose organization.    The size and shape of the mental body are determined by those of the causal  vehicle. There are in it certain striations which divide it more or less  irregularly into segments, each of these corresponding to a certain  department of the physical brain, so that every type of thought should  function through its duly assigned portion. The mental body is as yet so  imperfectly developed in ordinary men that there are many in whom a great  number of special departments are not yet in activity, and any attempt at  thought belonging to those departments has to travel round through some  inappropriate channel which happens to be fully open. The result is that  thought on those subjects is for those people clumsy and uncomprehending.  This is why some people have a head for mathematics and others are unable  to add correctly--why some people instinctively understand, appreciate and  enjoy music, while others do not know one tune from another.    All the matter of the mental body should be circulating freely, but  sometimes a man allows his thought upon a certain subject to set and  solidify, and then the circulation is impeded, and there is a congestion  which presently hardens into a kind of wart on the mental body. Such a wart  appears to us down here as a prejudice; and until it is absorbed and free  circulation restored, it is impossible for the man to think truly or to see  clearly with regard to that particular department of his mind, as the  congestion checks the free passage of undulations both outward and inward.    When a man uses any part of his mental body it not only vibrates for the  time more rapidly, but it also temporarily swells out and increases in  size. If there is prolonged thought upon a subject this increase becomes  permanent, and it is thus open to any man to increase the size of his  mental body either along desirable or undesirable lines.    Good thoughts produce vibrations of the finer matter of the body, which by  its specific gravity tends to float in the upper part of the ovoid; whereas  bad thoughts, such as selfishness and avarice, are always oscillations of  the grosser matter, which tends to gravitate towards the lower part of the  ovoid. Consequently the ordinary man, who yields himself not infrequently  to selfish thoughts of various kinds, usually expands the lower part of his  mental body, and presents roughly the appearance of an egg with its larger  end downwards. The man who has repressed those lower thoughts, and devoted  himself to higher ones, tends to expand the upper part of his mental body,  and therefore presents the appearance of an egg standing on its smaller  end. From a study of the colours and striations of a man's mental body the  clairvoyant can perceive his character and the progress he has made in his  present life. From similar features of the causal body he can see what  progress the ego has made since its original formation, when the man left  the animal kingdom.    When a man thinks of any concrete object--a book, a house, a landscape--he  builds a tiny image of the object in the matter of his mental body. This  image floats in the upper part of that body, usually in front of the face  of the man and at about the level of the eyes. It remains there as long as  the man is contemplating the object, and usually for a little time  afterwards, the length of time depending upon the intensity and the  clearness of the thought. This form is quite objective, and can be seen by  another person, if that other has developed the sight of his own mental  body. If a man thinks of another, he creates a tiny portrait in just the  same way. If his thought is merely contemplative and involves no feeling  (such as affection or dislike) or desire (such as a wish to see the person)  the thought does not usually perceptibly affect the man of whom he thinks.    If coupled with the thought of the person there is a feeling, as for  example of affection, another phenomenon occurs besides the forming of the  image. The thought of affection takes a definite form, which it builds out  of the matter of the thinker's mental body. Because of the emotion  involved, it draws round it also matter of his astral body, and thus we  have an astromental form which leaps out of the body in which it has been  generated, and moves through space towards the object of the feeling of  affection. If the thought is sufficiently strong, distance makes absolutely  no difference to it; but the thought of an ordinary person is usually weak  and diffused, and is therefore not effective outside a limited area.    When this thought-form reaches its object it discharges itself into his  astral and mental bodies, communicating to them its own rate of vibration.  Putting this in another way, a thought of love sent from one person to  another involves the actual transference of a certain amount both of force  and of matter from the sender to the recipient, and its effect upon the  recipient is to arouse the feeling of affection in him, and slightly but  permanently to increase his power of loving. But such a thought also  strengthens the power of affection in the thinker, and therefore it does  good simultaneously to both.    Every thought builds a form; if the thought be directed to another person  it travels to him; if it be distinctly selfish it remains in the immediate  neighbourhood of the thinker; if it belongs to neither of these categories  it floats for awhile in space and then slowly disintegrates. Every man  therefore is leaving behind him wherever he goes a trail of thought forms;  as we go along the street we are walking all the time amidst a sea of other  men's thoughts. If a man leaves his mind blank for a time, these residual  thoughts of others drift through it, making in most cases but little  impression upon him. Sometimes one arrives which attracts his attention, so  that his mind seizes upon it and makes it its own, strengthens it by the  addition of its force, and then casts it out again to affect somebody else.  A man therefore, is not responsible for a thought which floats into his  mind, because it may be not his, but someone else's; but he _is_  responsible if he takes it up, dwells upon it and then sends it out  strengthened.    Self-centred thought of any kind hangs about the thinker, and most men  surround their mental bodies with a shell of such thoughts. Such a shell  obscures the mental vision and facilitates the formation of prejudice.    Each thought-form is a temporary entity. It resembles a charged battery,  awaiting an opportunity to discharge itself. Its tendency is always to  reproduce its own rate of vibration in the mental"]]]
