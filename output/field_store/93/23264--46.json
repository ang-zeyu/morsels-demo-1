Tell me truly how  things stand.\"    \"Jasper has all. I have nothing.\"    \"I am glad of it.\"    \"Many thanks for the hearty speech. You at least speak sincerely,\" he  said bitterly.    \"I do, Maurice--I do; let me prove it.\"    Treherne's chair was close beside the balustrade. Mrs. Snowdon leaned on  the carved railing, with her back to the house and her face screened by  a tall urn. Looking steadily at him, she said rapidly and low, \"You  thought I wavered between you and Jasper, when we parted two years ago.  I did; but it was not between title and fortune that I hesitated. It was  between duty and love. My father, a fond, foolish old man, had set his  heart on seeing me a lady. I was his all; my beauty was his delight, and  no untitled man was deemed worthy of me. I loved him tenderly. You may  doubt this, knowing how selfish, reckless, and vain I am, but I have a  heart, and with better training had been a better woman. No matter, it  is too late now. Next my father, I loved you. Nay, hear me--I _will_  clear myself in your eyes. I mean no wrong to the general. He is kind,  indulgent, generous; I respect him--I am grateful, and while he lives, I  shall be true to him.\"    \"Then be silent now. Do not recall the past, Edith; let it sleep, for  both our sakes,\" began Treherne; but she checked him imperiously.    \"It shall, when I am done. I loved you, Maurice; for, of all the gay,  idle, pleasure-seeking men I saw about me, you were the only one who  seemed to have a thought beyond the folly of the hour. Under the seeming  frivolity of your life lay something noble, heroic, and true. I felt  that you had a purpose, that your present mood was but transitory--a  young man's holiday, before the real work of his life began. This  attracted, this won me; for even in the brief regard you then gave me,  there was an earnestness no other man had shown. I wanted your respect;  I longed to earn your love, to share your life, and prove that even in  my neglected nature slept the power of canceling a frivolous past by a  noble future. Oh, Maurice, had you lingered one week more, I never  should have been the miserable thing I am!\"    There her voice faltered and failed, for all the bitterness of lost  love, peace, and happiness sounded in the pathetic passion of that  exclamation. She did not weep, for tears seldom dimmed those tragical  eyes of hers; but she wrung her hands in mute despair, and looked down  into the frost-blighted gardens below, as if she saw there a true symbol  of her own ruined life. Treherne uttered not a word, but set his teeth  with an almost fierce glance toward the distant figure of Sir Jasper,  who was riding gaily away, like one unburdened by a memory or a care.    Hurriedly Mrs. Snowdon went on, \"My father begged and commanded me to  choose your cousin. I could not break his heart, and asked for time,  hoping to soften him. While I waited, that mysterious affair hurried you  from Paris, and then came the wreck, the illness, and the rumor that old  Sir Jasper had disinherited both nephews. They told me you were dying,  and I became a passive instrument in my father's hands. I promised to  recall and accept your cousin, but the old man died before it was done,  and then I cared not what became of me.    \"General Snowdon was my father's friend; he pitied me; he saw my  desolate, destitute state, my despair and helplessness. He comforted,  sustained, and saved me. I was grateful; and when he offered me his  heart and home, I accepted them. He knew I had no love to give; but as a  friend, a daughter, I would gladly serve him, and make his declining  years as happy as I could. It was all over, when I heard that you were  alive, afflicted, and poor. I longed to come and live for you. My new  bonds became heavy fetters then, my wealth oppressed me, and I was  doubly wretched--for I dared not tell my trouble, and it nearly drove me  mad. I have seen you now; I know that you are happy; I read your  cousin's love and see a peaceful life in store for you. This must  content me, and I must learn to bear it as I can.\"    She paused, breathless and pale, and walked rapidly along the terrace,  as if to hide or control the agitation that possessed her.    Treherne still sat silent, but his heart leaped within him, as he  thought, \"She sees that Octavia loves me! A woman's eye is quick to  detect love in another, and she asserts what I begin to hope. My  cousin's manner just now, her dislike of Annon, her new shyness with me;  it may be true, and if it is--Heaven help me--what am I saying! I must  not hope, nor wish, nor dream; I must renounce and forget.\"    He leaned his head upon his hand, and sat so still Mrs. Snowdon rejoined  him, pale, but calm and self-possessed. As she drew near, she marked his  attitude, the bitter sadness of his face, and hope sprang up within her.  Perhaps she was mistaken; perhaps he did not love his cousin; perhaps he  still remembered the past, and still regretted the loss of the heart she  had just laid bare before him. Her husband was failing, and might die  any day. And then, free, rich, beautiful, and young, what might she not  become to Treherne, helpless, poor, and ambitious? With all her faults,  she was generous, and this picture charmed her fancy, warmed her heart,  and comforted her pain.    \"Maurice,\" she said softly, pausing again beside him, \"if I mistake you  and your hopes, it is because I dare ask nothing for myself; but if ever  a time shall come when I have liberty to give or help, ask of me  _anything_, and it is gladly yours.\"    He understood her, pitied her, and, seeing that she found consolation in  a distant hope, he let her enjoy it while she might. Gravely, yet  gratefully, he spoke, and pressed the hand extended to him with an  impulsive gesture.    \"Generous as ever, Edith, and impetuously frank. Thank you for your  sincerity, your kindness, and the affection you once gave me. I say  'once,' for now duty, truth, and honor bar us from each other. My life  must be solitary, yet I shall find work to do, and learn to be content.  You owe all devotion to the good old man who loves you, and will not  fail him, I am sure. Leave the future and the past, but let us make the  present what it may be--a time to forgive and forget, to take heart and  begin anew. Christmas is a fitting time for such resolves, and the birth  of friendship such as ours may be.\"    Something in his tone and manner struck her, and, eyeing him with soft  wonder, she exclaimed, \"How changed you are!\"    \"Need you tell me that?\" And he glanced at his helpless limbs with a  bitter yet pathetic look of patience.    \"No, no--not so! I mean in mind, not body. Once you were gay and  careless, eager and fiery, like Jasper; now you are grave and quiet, or  cheerful, and so very kind. Yet, in spite of illness and loss, you seem  twice the man you were, and something wins respect, as well as  admiration--and love.\"    Her dark eyes filled as the last word left her lips, and the beauty of a  touched heart shone in her face. Maurice looked up quickly, asking with  sudden earnestness, \"Do you see it? Then it is true. Yes, I _am_  changed, thank God! And she has done it.\"    \"Who?\" demanded his companion jealously.    \"Octavia. Unconsciously, yet surely, she has done much for me, and this  year of seeming loss and misery has been the happiest, most profitable  of my life. I have often heard that afflictions were the best teachers,  and I believe it now.\"    Mrs. Snowdon shook her head sadly.    \"Not always; they are tormentors to some. But don't preach, Maurice. I  am still a sinner, though you incline to sainthood, and I have one  question more to ask. What was it that took you and Jasper so suddenly  away from Paris?\"    \"That I can never tell you.\"    \"I shall discover it for myself, then.\"    \"It is impossible.\"    \"Nothing is impossible to a determined woman.\"    \"You can neither wring, surprise, nor bribe this secret from the two  persons who hold it. I beg of you to let it rest,\" said Treherne  earnestly.    \"I have a clue, and I shall follow it; for I am convinced that something  is wrong, and you are--\"    \"Dear Mrs. Snowdon, are you so charmed with the birds that you forget  your fellow-beings, or so charmed with one fellow-being that you forget  the birds?\"    As the sudden question startled both, Rose Talbot came along the  terrace, with hands full of holly and a face full of merry mischief,  adding as she vanished, \"I shall tell Tavie that feeding the  peacocks is such congenial amusement for lovers, she and Mr. Annon  had better try it.\"    \"Saucy gypsy!\" muttered Treherne.    But Mrs. Snowdon said, with a smile of double meaning, \"Many a true word  is spoken in jest.\"          Chapter V      UNDER THE MISTLETOE    Unusually gay and charming the three young friends looked, dressed  alike in fleecy white with holly wreaths in their hair, as they  slowly descended the wide oaken stairway arm in arm. A footman was  lighting the hall lamps, for the winter dusk gathered early, and the  girls were merrily chatting about the evening's festivity when  suddenly a loud, long shriek echoed through the hall. A heavy glass  shade fell from the man's hand with a crash, and the young ladies  clung to one another aghast, for mortal terror was in the cry, and a  dead silence followed it.    \"What was it, John?\" demanded Octavia, very pale, but steady in a  moment.    \"I'll go and see, miss.\" And the man hurried away.    \"Where did the dreadful scream come from?\" asked Rose, collecting her  wits as rapidly as possible.    \"Above us somewhere. Oh, let us go down among people; I am frightened to  death,\" whispered Blanche, trembling and faint.    Hurrying into the parlor, they found only Annon and the major, both  looking startled, and both staring out of the windows.    \"Did you hear it? What could it be? Don't go and leave us!\" cried the  girls in a breath, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1,"th-southwest of Honolulu, about    halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand  Map references:    Oceania  Area:   total area:    199 km2   land area:    199 km2   comparative area:    slightly larger than Washington, DC   note:    includes Rose Island and Swains Island  Land boundaries:    0 km  Coastline:    116 km  Maritime claims:   contiguous zone:    24 nm   continental shelf:    200 m or depth of exploitation   exclusive economic zone:    200 nm   territorial sea:    12 nm  International disputes:    none  Climate:    tropical marine, moderated by southeast trade winds; annual rainfall    averages 124 inches; rainy season from November to April, dry season from    May to October; little seasonal temperature variation  Terrain:    five volcanic islands with rugged peaks and limited coastal plains, two    coral atolls (Rose Island, Swains Island)  Natural resources:    pumice, pumicite  Land use:   arable land:    10%   permanent crops:    5%   meadows and pastures:    0%   forest and woodland:    75%   other:    10%  Irrigated land:    NA km2  Environment:    typhoons common from December to March  Note:    Pago Pago has one of the best natural deepwater harbors in the South Pacific    Ocean, sheltered by shape from rough seas and protected by peripheral    mountains from high winds; strategic location in the South Pacific Ocean    *American Samoa, People    Population:    53,139 (July 1993 est.)
