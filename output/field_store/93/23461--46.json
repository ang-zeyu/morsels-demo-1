It is usually built with dry twigs as a foundation, very  commonly thorny and prickly twigs being used, on which the true nest,  composed of fine twigs and lined with grass-roots, is constructed. The  nests vary much: some are large and loosely put together, say, fully 9  inches in diameter and 6 inches in height externally; some are smaller  and more densely built, and perhaps not above 7 inches in diameter  and 4 inches in depth. The egg-cavity is usually about 5 inches in  diameter and 2 inches in depth, but they vary very much both in size  and materials; and I see that I note of one nest taken at Agra on the  3rd August--\"A very shallow saucer some 6 inches in diameter, and  with a central depression not above 11/2 inch in depth. It was composed  _exclusively_ of roots; externally somewhat coarse, internally of  somewhat finer ones. It was very loosely put together.\"    Five is the full complement of eggs, but it is very common to find  only four fully incubated ones.    Mr. W. Blewitt writes that he \"found several nests in the latter half  of April, May, and the early part of June in the neighbourhood of  Hansie.    \"Four was the greatest number of eggs I found in any nest.    \"The nests were placed in neem, keekur, and shishum trees, at heights  of from 10 to 17 feet from the ground, and were densely built of twigs  mostly of the keekur and shishum, and more or less thickly lined with  fine straw and leaves. They varied from 6 to 8 inches in diameter and  from 2 to 3 inches in depth.\"    Mr. A. Anderson writes:--\"The Indian Magpie lays from April to July,  and I have once actually seen a pair building in February. Their  eggs are of two very distinct types,--the one which, according to  my experience, is the ordinary one, is covered all over with  reddish-brown spots or rather blotches, chiefly towards the big end,  on a pale greenish-white ground, and is rather a handsome egg; the  other is a pale green egg with _faint brown_ markings, which are  confined almost entirely to the obtuse end. I have another clutch of  eggs taken at Budaon in 1865, which presents an intermediate variety  between the above two extremes; these are profusely blotched with  russet-brown on a dirty-white ground.    \"The second and third nests above referred to contained five eggs; but  the usual complement is not more than four. On the 2nd August, 1872,  I made the following note relative to the breeding of this bird:--The  bird flew off immediately we approached the tree, and never appeared  again. The nest viewed from below looked larger; this is owing to dry  _babool_ twigs or rather small branches (some of them having thorns  from an inch to 2 inches long!) having been used as a foundation, and  actually encircling the nest, no doubt by way of protection against  vermin; some of these thorny twigs were a foot long, and they had  to be removed piecemeal before the nest proper could be got at. The  egg-cavity is deep, measuring 5 inches in depth by 4 in breadth inside  measurement; it is well lined with khus grass.\"    Major Bingham says:--    \"Common as is this bird I have only found one nest, and that was at  Allahabad on the 9th July, and contained one half-fledged young one  and an addled egg. The nest, which was placed at the very top of a  large mango-tree, was constructed of branches and twigs of the same  lined with fine grass-roots. The egg is a yellowish white, thickly  speckled, chiefly at the large end, with rusty. Length 1.10 by 0.82 in  breadth.\"    Colonel Butler tells us that it \"breeds in Sind, in the hot weather.  Mr. Doig took a nest containing three fresh eggs on the 1st May, 1878.  The eggs, which seem to me to be remarkably small for the size of the  bird, are of the first type mentioned in Rough Draft of 'Nests and  Eggs,' p. 422.\"    Lieut. H.E. Barnes says in his 'Birds of Bombay:'--\"In Sind they breed  during May and June, always choosing babool trees, placing the nest  in a stoutish fork near the top; they are composed at the bottom of  thorny twigs, which form a sort of foundation upon which the true nest  is built; the latter consists of fine twigs lined with grass-roots;  the nest is frequently of large size.\"    Mr. G.W. Vidal, writing of the South Konkan, says:--\"Common about all  well-wooded villages from coast to Ghats. Breeds in April.\"    With regard to Cachar Mr. Inglis writes:--\"This Magpie is very common  in all the neighbouring villages, but I have not often seen it in the  jungles. It remains all the year and breeds during April and May.\"    The eggs are typically somewhat elongated ovals, a good deal pointed  towards the small end. They vary extraordinarily in colour and  character, as well as extent of markings, but, as remarked when  speaking of the Raven, all the eggs out of the same nest closely  resemble each other, while the eggs of different nests are almost  invariably markedly distinct. There are, however, two leading  types--the one in which the markings are bright red, brownish red, or  pale pinkish purple; and the other in which they are olive-brown and  pale purplish brown. In the first type the ground-colour is either  pale salmon, or else very pale greenish white, and the markings are  either bold blotches, more or less confluent at the large end, where  they are far most numerous, and only a few specks and spots towards  the smaller end, or they are spots and small blotches thickly  distributed over the whole surface, or they are streaky smudges  forming a mottled ill-defined cap at the large end, and running down  thence in streaks and spots longitudinally; in the other type the  ground-colour is greenish white or pale yellowish stone-colour, and  the character of the markings varies as in the preceding type. Besides  these there are a few eggs with a dingy greyish-white ground, with  very faint, cloudy, ill-defined spots of pale yellowish brown pretty  uniformly distributed over the whole surface. In nine eggs out of  ten, the markings are most dense at the large end, where they form  irregular, more or less imperfect caps or zones. A few of the eggs are  slightly glossy.    Of the salmon-pink type some specimens in their coloration resemble  eggs of _Dicrurus longicaudatus_ and some of our Goatsuckers, while of  those with the greenish-white ground-colour some strongly recall the  eggs of _Lanius lahtora_.    In length the eggs vary from 1.0 to 1.3, and in breadth from 0.78 to  0.95; but the average of forty-four eggs is 1.17 by 0.87.      17. Dendrocitta leucogastra, Gould. _The Southern Tree-pie_.    Dendrocitta leucogastra, _Gould, Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 317; _Hume,  Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 678.    From Travancore Mr. Bourdillon has kindly sent me an egg and the  following note on the nidification of the Southern Tree-pie:--    \"Three eggs, very hard-set, of an ashy-white colour, marked with ashy  and greenish-brown blotches, 1.12 long and 0.87 broad, were taken on  9th March, 1873, from a nest in a bush 8 or 10 feet from the ground.  The nest of twigs was built after the style of the English Magpie's  nest, minus the dome. It consisted of a large platform 6 inches deep  and 8 or 10 inches broad, supporting a nest 11/2 inch deep and 31/2 inches  broad. The bird is not at all uncommon on the Assamboo Hills between  the elevations of 1500 and 3000 feet above the sea, seeming to prefer  the smaller jungle and more open parts of the heavy forest.\"    Later he writes:--\"On the 8th April I found another nest containing  three half-fledged Magpies (_D. leucogastra_). The nest was entirely  composed of twigs, roughly but securely put together; interior  diameter 3 inches and depth 2 inches, though there was a good-sized  base or platform, say, 5 inches in diameter. The nest was situated on  the top fork of a sapling about 12 feet from the ground. I tried to  rear the young birds, but they all died within a week.\"    The egg is very like that of our other Indian Tree-pies. It is in  shape a broad and regular oval, only slightly compressed towards one  end. The shell is fine and compact and is moderately glossy. The  ground is a creamy stone-colour. It is profusely blotched and streaked  with a somewhat pale yellowish brown, these markings being most  numerous and darkest in a broad, irregular, imperfect zone round the  large end, and it exhibits further a number of pale inky-purple clouds  and blotches, which seem to underlie the brown markings, and which are  chiefly confined to the broader half of the egg. The latter measures  1.13 by 0.86.      18. Dendrocitta himalayensis, Bl. _The Himalayan Tree-pie_.    Dendrocitta sinensis (_Lath._) _Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 316.  Dendrocitta himalayensis, _Bl., Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 676.    Common as is the Himalayan Tree-pie throughout the lower ranges of  those mountains from which it derives its name, I personally have  never taken a nest.    It breeds, I know, at elevations of from 2000 to 6000 feet, during the  latter half of May, June, July, and probably the first half of August.    A nest in my museum taken by Mr. Gammie in Sikhim, at an elevation of  about 2500 feet, out of a small tree, on the 30th of July, contained  two fresh eggs. It was a very shallow cup, composed entirely of fine  stems, apparently of some kind of creeper, strongly but not at all  compactly interwoven; in fact, though the nest holds together firmly,  you can see through it everywhere. It is about 6 inches in external  diameter, and has an egg-cavity of about 4 inches wide and 1.5 deep.  It has no pretence for lining of any kind.    Of another nest which he took Mr. Gammie says:--\"I found a nest  containing three fresh eggs in a bush, at a height of about 10 feet  from the ground. The nest was a very loose, shallow, saucer-like  affair, some 6 or 7 inches in diameter and an inch or so in thickness,  composed entirely of the dry stems and tendrils of creepers.

Here at one time his old  uncle priest, Charles Millet, held the office of vicar and went every  morning to say mass.    Among the earliest recollections of Jean Francois was a visit to the  church of Greville at a time when some new bells had just been bought.  They were first to be baptized, as was the custom, before being hung  in the tower, and it was while they still stood on the ground that the  mother brought her little boy to see them. \"I well remember how much  I was impressed,\" he afterwards said, \"at finding myself in so vast a  place as the church, which seemed even more immense than our barn, and  how the beauty of the big windows, with their lozenge-shaped panes,  struck my imagination.\"    At the age of twelve the boy went to be confirmed at the church  of Greville, and thenceforth had another memorable experience to  associate with the place. The vicar, who questioned him, found him so  intelligent that he offered to teach him Latin. The lessons led to the  poems of Virgil, which opened a new world to him.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE CHURCH AT GREVILLE]    Years passed; the boy became a man and the man became a famous artist.  But the path to fame had been a toilsome one, and as Millet pressed on  his way he was able to return but seldom to the spots he had loved  in his youth, and then only on sad errands. At length the time  came (1871) when the artist brought his entire family to his native  Grenville to spend a long summer holiday. Millet made many sketches  of familiar scenes which gave him material for work for the next three  years. One of these pictures was that of the village church, which  he began to paint sitting at one of the windows of the inn where the  family were staying.    If the building had lost the grandeur it possessed for his childish  imagination, it was still full of artistic possibilities for a  beautiful picture.    It is a solid structure, and we fancy that the builders did not have  far to bring the stone of which it is composed. The great granite  cliffs which rise from the sea must be an inexhaustible quarry.  The building is low and broad, to withstand the bleak winds. A less  substantial structure, perched on this plateau, would be swept over  the cliffs into the sea. There is something about it suggestive of the  sturdy character of the Norman peasants themselves, strong, patient,  and enduring. It is very old; the passing years have covered the walls  with moss, and nature seems to have made the place her own. It is as  if, instead of being built with hands, it were a portion of the old  cliffs themselves.    The grassy hillock against which the church nestles is filled with  graves, a cross here and there marking the place where some more  important personage is buried. Here is the sacred spot where Millet's  saintly old grandmother was laid to rest. A rough stone wall surrounds  the churchyard, as old and moss-grown as the building itself. Some  stone steps leading into the yard are hollowed by the feet of many  generations of worshippers. In the rear is a low stone house embowered  in trees.    The square bell-tower lifts a weather-vane against the sky, and the  birds flock about it as about an old home. The rather steep roof is  slightly depressed, as if beginning to sink in.    With a painter's instinct Millet chose the point of view from which  all the lines of the church would be most beautiful and whence we may  see to the best advantage the quaint outlines of the tower. Beside  this, he took for his work the day and hour when that great artist,  the sun, could lend most effective help. So we see the simple little  building at its best. The sky makes a glorious background, with fleecy  clouds delicately veiling its brilliancy. The bright light throws  a shadow of the tower across the roof, breaking the monotony of its  length. The bareness of the big barn-like end is softened by the  shadow in which it is seen. The plain side is decorated with the  shadows of the buttresses and window embrasures.    The sheep are as much at home here as the birds. They nibble  contentedly in the road by the wall, and are undisturbed by the  approach of a villager. Beyond, at the left, is a glimpse of the level  stretch of the sea. This is a spot where earth and sky and water meet,  where the fishermen from the sea and the ploughmen from the fields  come to worship God.          XI    THE SOWER      It is nightfall, and the sky is cloudy save where the last rays of the  setting sun illumine a spot on the horizon. While the light lasts,  the Sower still holds to his task of sowing the seed. A large sack of  grain is fastened about his body and hangs at his left side, where one  end of it is grasped firmly in the left hand lest any of the precious  seed be spilled. Into this bag he plunges his right hand from time to  time, and draws out a handful of grain which he flings into the furrow  as he walks along.    The Sower's task ended, a series of strange transformations begins in  the life of the seed. The winter rain softens and swells it, and when  spring comes it pushes its way up in a tiny shoot. Soon the slender  blades appear in close lines; by and by the stalks grow tall and  strong, and the field is full of the beautiful green grain.    Then the hot summer sun shines with ripening power; the wheat turns a  golden yellow; the ears bend under the weight of the grain, and it is  time for the harvest. The reapers come with sickle and scythe, and  the grain is cut, and bound into great sheaves. The thrashing follows,  when the ear is shaken off the stalk, and the grain is winnowed. And  now the mills take up the work, the golden wheat grains are crushed,  and the fine white flour which they contain is sifted and put into  bags. The flour is mixed and kneaded and baked, and at length comes  forth from the oven a fragrant loaf of bread.    Now bread is a necessity of life to the people, and the supply of  bread turns on the history of the seed. If the harvest is plenty, the  people may eat and be happy. If it is poor, they suffer the miseries  of hunger. If it fails altogether, they die of starvation. It is then  a solemn moment when the seed is planted. Often the sower begins  his task by tossing a handful of grain into the air in the sign of a  cross, offering a prayer for a blessing on the seed. His is a grave  responsibility; every handful of seed means many loaves of bread for  hungry mouths. He must choose the right kind of seed for his soil, the  right kind of weather for the planting, and use the grain neither too  lavishly nor too sparingly.[1]    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE SOWER]    This is why the Sower in our picture takes his task so seriously. He  carries in his hand the key to prosperity. He is a true king. Peasant  though he is, he feels the dignity of his calling, and bears himself  royally. He advances with a long swinging stride, measuring his steps  rhythmically as if beating time to inaudible music. His right arm  moves to and fro, swinging from the shoulder as on a pivot, and  describing the arc of a circle.    The hilly field in which he works is such as the painter Millet was  familiar with in his peasant childhood in Normandy. A yoke of oxen are  drawing the plough in the distance, as is the custom in that province.  The Sower himself is a true Norman peasant.    It is interesting to trace the outlines of the composition. There  is first the long line on the Sower's right side, beginning at the  shoulder and following the outer edge of the right leg to the ground.  On the other side, curving to meet this, is a line which begins at the  top of the head, follows the left arm and the overhanging sack, and  is faintly continued by the tiny stream of seed which leaks from the  corner of the bag and falls near the Sower's foot. Crossing these  curves in the opposite direction are the lines of the right arm and  the left leg. Thus the figure is painted in strong simple outlines  such as we see in the statues by great sculptors.    The line defining the edge of the field against the sky, sloping in  the direction in which the Sower walks, adds to the impression of  motion which is so strongly suggested by the picture. As we look, we  almost expect to see the Sower reach the foot of the slope, and stride  out of sight, still flinging the grain as he goes.    There is another thing to note about the composition, and that is  the perfect proportion of the single figure to the canvas which it so  completely fills. This was the result of the painter's experiments.  In the haste of his first inspiration he did not allow space enough to  surround the Sower.[2] He then carefully traced the figure on a larger  canvas and made a second picture. Afterwards the same subject was  repeated in a Barbizon landscape.    Our American poet William Cullen Bryant has written a poem called  \"The Song of the Sower,\" which is very suggestive in connection with  Millet's painting.[3] This is the way the song ends:--      \"Brethren, the sower's task is done,    The seed is in its winter bed.    Now let the dark-brown mould be spread,    To hide it from the sun,    And leave it to the kindly care    Of the still earth and brooding air,    As when the mother, from her breast,    Lays the hushed babe apart to rest,    And shades its eyes, and waits to see    How sweet its waking smile will be.    The tempest now may smite, the sleet    All night on the drowned furrow beat,    And winds that, from the cloudy hold,    Of winter breathe the bitter cold,    Stiffen to stone the yellow mould,      Yet safe shall lie the wheat;    Till, out of heaven's unmeasured blue    Shall walk again the genial year,    To wake with warmth and nurse with dew    The germs we lay to slumber here.\"      [Footnote 1: For farmer's lore as to the"]]]
