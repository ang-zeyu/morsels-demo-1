I have a fine teacher in my son Carl  who, without sparing his old child by indulgence, takes the field  against my prejudices. He taught me two new lessons this very morning,  and in the most clever way, without opening his mouth and without even  letting me see him--yes, by that very means. In the first place, he  showed me that it is not necessary for a man to keep his word; in the  second, that it is superfluous to go to church and freshen up one's  memory of God's laws. Yesterday evening he promised me that he would go,  and I counted on his doing it, for I thought to myself: He will want to  thank the gracious Creator for the recovery of his mother. But he wasn't  there, and I was very comfortable all alone in my pew, which, to be  sure, is a little too short for two persons anyway. I wonder if he would  like it if I myself were to act in accordance with the new doctrine, by  not keeping my word with him? I have promised him a new suit for his  birthday, and I might take the opportunity to test his joy over my  docility. But prejudice! Prejudice! I shall not do it!    LEONARD.    Perhaps he was not well--    ANTONY.    Possibly! I need only to ask my wife, then I am sure to hear that he is  sick. For she tells me the truth about everything else in the world, but  never about the boy. And even if he was not sick!--There too the younger  generation has the advantage over us old folks, in that they can find  their spiritual edification anywhere, and can do their worshipping when  they are out trapping birds, or taking a walk, or sitting in the  ale-house. \"Our Father who art in Heaven\"--\"Good day, Peter, shall I  see you at the dance this evening?\"--\"Hallowed be Thy name\"--\"Yes, laugh  if you will, Catherine, but it is true\"--\"Thy will be done\"--\"The devil  take me, I am not shaved yet!\"--and so forth. And each one pronounces  the blessing on himself, for he is a man just as much as the preacher,  and the power that emanates from a black garb certainly exists in a blue  one as well. Nor have I anything to say against it; even if you want to  intersperse the seven petitions with seven glasses, what of it? I can't  prove to anybody that beer and religion don't mix well, and perhaps it  will some day get into the liturgy as a new way of taking the Eucharist.  Frankly, I myself, old sinner that I am, am not strong enough to keep  pace with fashion; I cannot catch up worship in the street, as if it  were a cockchafer; for me the chirping of swallows and sparrows cannot  take the place of the organ. If I want to feel my heart exalted, I must  hear the heavy, iron doors of the church close behind me and think to  myself that they are the doors of the world. The dismal high walls with  their narrow windows, that admit but a dim remnant of the bold garish  daylight as if they were sifting it, must surround me on all sides. And  in the distance I must be able to see the charnel-house, with its  death-head cut in the wall. Oh well, better is better.    LEONARD.    You are too particular about it!    ANTONY.    Of course! Of course! And today, as an honest man, I must confess that  what I have been saying did not hold good; for I lost my reverent mood  in church, being annoyed by the vacant seat beside me, and found it  again under the pear-tree in my garden. You are astonished? But look! I  went sadly and dejectedly home, like one whose harvest has been ruined  by hail; for children are like fields--we sow good corn in them and  weeds sprout up. Under the pear-tree, which the caterpillars have half  eaten up, I stood still. \"Yes,\" I thought, \"the boy is like this tree,  empty and barren.\" Then I suddenly imagined that I was very thirsty, and  absolutely had to go over to the tavern. I deceived myself--it wasn't to  get a glass of beer that I wanted to go; it was to seek out the young  man and take him to task in the tavern, where I knew he was sure to be.  I was just about to start, when the sensible old tree let fall a juicy  pear right at my feet, as if to say: Take that for your thirst, and for  slandering me by comparing me with that good-for-nothing son of yours. I  deliberated a moment, took a bite of it, and went into the house.    LEONARD.    Do you know that the apothecary is on the verge of bankruptcy?    ANTONY.    What do I care?    LEONARD.    Don't you care at all    ANTONY.    Surely! I am a Christian--the man has several children!    LEONARD.    And still more creditors. The children, too, are creditors in a way.    ANTONY.    Happy is he who is neither the one nor the other!    LEONARD.    I thought you yourself--    ANTONY.    That was settled up long ago.    LEONARD.    You are a prudent man; of course you immediately demanded your money  when you saw that the green-grocer was about to fail.    ANTONY.    Yes, I need not tremble any more with the fear of losing it--it was lost  long ago!    LEONARD.    You are joking!    ANTONY.    In all seriousness!    CLARA (_looks in at the door_).    Did you call, father?    ANTONY.    Are your ears beginning to ring already? We had not talked about you  yet!    CLARA.    The weekly paper!    LEONARD.    You are a philosopher!    ANTONY.    What do you mean by that?    LEONARD.    You know how to compose yourself.    ANTONY.    I wear a mill-stone as a cravat sometimes, instead of going to the river  with it. That gives one a strong back.    LEONARD.    Let him who can imitate you.    ANTONY.    He who has such a gallant fellow to help him bear it, as I seem to have  found in you, ought to be able to dance under the burden. You have grown  quite pale. I call that sympathy!    LEONARD.    I hope you don't misunderstand me!    ANTONY.    Certainly not!    [_He drums on a dresser._]    That wood is not transparent, is it?    LEONARD.    I do not understand you!    ANTONY.    How foolish it was of our grandfather Adam to take Eve, when she was  naked and destitute, and did not even bring a fig-leaf with her. We two,  you and I, would have scourged her out of Paradise as a tramp! What do  you think?    LEONARD.    You are exasperated with your son.--I have come to you regarding your  daughter--    ANTONY.    You had better be careful!--Perhaps I'll not say no!    LEONARD.    I hope you will not. And I will tell you what I think: The patriarchs  themselves never used to scorn the dowries of their women. Jacob loved  Rachel and courted her seven years, but he also liked the fat rams and  sheep that he earned in her father's service. That, I think, was not to  his discredit, and to outdo him in anything would be to put him to the  blush. I should have liked very much to see your daughter bring a  couple of hundred thalers with her; and that was quite natural, because  she herself would thereby be so much the better off with me. If a girl  brings her bed in her trunk, then she will not have to card wool and  spin yarn. In this case it will not be so, but what of it? We'll make a  Sunday dinner out of Lenten fare, and a Christmas feast out of Sunday's  roast. In that way we'll make out all right!    ANTONY (_offers him his hand_).    You talk well, and God smiles on your words. Well, I will forget that  for fourteen days at tea-time my daughter put a cup on the table for you  in vain. And now that you are to be my son-in-law, I will tell you where  the thousand thalers are!    LEONARD (_aside_).    So they are gone then! Well, I shall not have to go out of my way to  please the old werewolf, even if he is my father-in-law!    ANTONY.    Things went hard with me in my early years. I was no more of a bristly  hedgehog than you when I came into the world, but I have gradually grown  to be one. At first all the quills in my case pointed inward, and people  found pleasure in pricking and pinching my soft smooth skin, and were  amused to see me flinch when the points penetrated into my very heart  and bowels. But the thing did not appeal to me; I turned my skin inside  out and then the quills pricked their fingers and I had peace.    LEONARD (_to himself_).    Safe from the very devil, methinks!    ANTONY.    My father, by not allowing himself any rest day or night, worked himself  to death in his thirtieth year, and my mother nourished me as well as  she could with her spinning. I grew up without learning anything. When I  became larger and was still unable to earn any money, I would gladly  have disaccustomed myself to eating; but when now and then at noon I  would pretend to be sick and push back my plate, what did it mean? It  meant that in the evening my stomach would compel me to announce myself  well again! My greatest grief was that I was so unskilled. I used to  blame myself for it, as if it were my own fault, as if in my mother's  womb I had been supplied with nothing but teeth to eat with, as if I had  purposely left behind me there all the useful capabilities and assets. I  used to blush with shame when the sun shone on me. Just after my  confirmation the man whom they buried yesterday, Master Gebhard, came  into our house. He scowled and made a wry face, as he always used to  frown when he had anything good in mind to do. Then he said to my  mother: \"Did you bring your youngster into the world in order to let him  eat the very nose and ears off your head?\" I felt ashamed and put the  loaf of bread, from which I was just on the point of cutting off a  piece, back into the cupboard again. My mother took offense at his  well-meant words; she stopped her wheel and replied vehemently that her  son was a fine good fellow. \"Well, we will see about that,\" said the  Master. \"If he wants to, he can come right now, just as he stands there,  into my workshop with me. I do not ask any money for teaching him; he  will get his board, and his clothes I will also supply; and if he wants  to get up early and go to bed late, opportunities will not be wanting  for him to earn a little money on the side for his old mother.\" My  mother began to cry and I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"of a flood; some good grass also was found for the cattle on firm  ground at the distance of about two miles.    GOOBANG CREEK.    Mount Allan (Wollar of the natives) lay north-east by north, at a  distance of 3 3/4 miles. It was not a conspicuous or commanding hill, but  between it and our camp we this day discovered a feature of considerable  importance. This was the Goobang creek of our former journey, to all  appearance here as great a river as the Bogan and indeed its channel,  where we formerly saw it, contained deep ponds of clear water at a season  when the muddy holes of the Bogan had nearly failed us. Here the Goobang  much resembled that river in the depth of its bed and the character of  its banks: and its sources and tributaries must be also similar to those  of the Bogan. Hervey's range gives birth to the one, Croker's range to  the other and, their respective courses being along the opposite sides of  the higher land extending westward between the Lachlan and Macquarie, all  their tributaries must fall from the same ridge. Of these Mr. Oxley  crossed several in his route from the Lachlan to the Macquarie;  Emmeline's Valley creek belonging to the basin of the Goobang;  Coysgaine's ponds and Allan's water to that of the Bogan. It was rather  unfortunate, considering how much has been said about the Lachlan  receiving no tributaries in its long course, that Mr. Oxley left  unexplored that part where a tributary of such importance as the Goobang  joins it; especially as the floods of this stream lay the country below  Mount Cunningham under water, and are the sole cause of that swampy  appearance which Mr. Oxley observed from the hill on looking westward. It  would appear that this traveller's route northward was nearly parallel to  the general course of the Goobang. The name this stream receives from the  natives here is Billibang, Goobang being considered but one of its  tributaries. Its course completes the analogy between the rivers and  plains on each side, and the supposed disappearance of the channel of the  Lachlan seemed consequently as doubtful as the mysterious termination of  the Macquarie.    April 1.    The rain continuing, the party remained encamped. The barometer had  fallen since we came here from 29.442, at which it stood last night at  ten, to 29.180, which I noted this morning at six: the thermometer  continuing about 60 degrees of Fahrenheit.    LARGE FISHES.    On dragging our net through the muddy pond we captured two fishes, but of  monstrous size, one weighing 17 pounds, the other about 12 pounds.  Although very different in shape, I recognised in them the fish of the  perch kind with large scales* and the eel-fish** formerly caught by us in  the Namoi. But the former when taken in that river was coarse and tasted  of mud, whereas this ruffe, although so large was not coarse, but rich,  and of excellent flavour--and so fat that the flakes fell into crumbs  when fried. This day a bird of a new species was shot by Roach. It was of  a swallow kind, about the size of a snipe, of a leaden colour, with dark  head and wings.    (*Footnote. Cernua bidyana.)    (**Footnote. Plotosus tandanus.)    HEAVY RAIN.    April 2.    The rain continued through the night and this morning it fell rather  heavily, so that enough of water could be gathered from the surface of  the plains near our camp to preclude the necessity for our having  recourse to the muddy pool. The barometer began to rise slowly from seven  in the morning, when it had reached its minimum; but the weather  continued hazy, with drizzling rain (from the south-west) until four  o'clock, when the clouds slowly drew up. The plains were not yet at all  saturated, although become too soft for our carts. The evening was  cloudy, but by ten o'clock the state of the barometer was such as to  leave little doubt about the return of fair weather. We this day found in  the woods to the northward a most beautiful species of Trichinium, with  spiky feathered pale yellow flowers, sometimes as much as six inches  long.*    (*Footnote. Tr. nobile, Lindley manuscripts; foliis caulinis obovatis  cuspidatis subundulatis ramisque corymbosis angulatis glabris, spica  cylindracea: rachi lanata, calycis laciniis 3 acutis 2 retusis, bracteis  puberulis. Differs from Tr. densum, Cunningham in the bracts not being  villous at the base, and from T. macrocephalum, R. Br. in having much  larger flowers, which are yellow not lilac, and in three of the segments  of the calyx being acute.)    ASCEND MOUNT ALLAN.    April 3.    Thick fog in the morning. The day being Sunday the party remained in the  camp; but I do not think we could have left it from the soft state of the  plains, however desirable it might have been to proceed. After twelve I  rode to Wollar (Mount Allan) with the theodolite, and from its summit I  intersected most of the hills seen from Mounts Amyot and Cunningham. A  small wart on the eastern horizon, very distant yet conspicuous, I found  to be Mount Juson, the hill on which I had stood with the brother of the  botanist whose name had been given to this hill by Mr. Oxley.    The sameness in the surface of this country is apparently owing to the  simplicity of its geological composition. All the hills I ascended below  the junction of Byrne's creek consist of ferruginous sandstone, similar  to that which constitutes all the hills I saw on, and even beyond, the  Darling.    On passing to and from Mount Allan we crossed, at three-quarters of a  mile from the camp, Goobang creek, the bed of which exactly resembles  that of the Bogan. The remains of drifted weeds on the trees and the  uniformity of its channel showed that it is a considerable tributary of  the Lachlan. At length the stars appeared in the evening, and I could  once more see my unerring guides, the faithful Little Dog, and the mighty  Hercules,* whereby our latitude seemed to be 33 degrees 8 minutes 55  seconds South.    (*Footnote. Procyon, in Canis Minor and Regulus in Leo. The latter being  also called Hercules and Cor Leonis.)    NATIVES FROM THE BOGAN.    At the camp we recognised among the natives seated at our fire two of our  friends from the Bogan. Their little shovel of hard wood (not used on the  Lachlan) and one of the tomahawks formerly distributed by us left no room  to doubt whether we were right about their features.    PROPHECY OF A CORADJE.    One was an old man and a Coradje, the other was a boy. They disappeared  in the evening, but the Coradje was so far civil as to tell the men that,  having heard The Major was praying for rain, he had caused the late fall.  This priest had also prophesied a little for our information, telling the  men that a day was at hand when two of them would go out to watch the  bullocks and would never return.    April 4.    The surface being sufficiently dry to enable us to travel we accordingly  continued our journey and, crossing the Goobang at 5 1/4 miles, we kept  the right bank of it during the day. The surface on that side was dry and  firm; and it may be remarked that if ever it becomes desirable to open a  line of communication from Sydney towards the country on the lower part  of the Murray, the right bank of the Goobang will probably be found the  best direction as the adjacent valley affords both grass and water for  the passage of cattle, and the doubtful plains of the Lachlan may be thus  avoided.    POISONED WATERHOLE.    We finally encamped on the Lachlan at the junction of the Goobang, in  latitude 33 degrees 5 minutes 20 seconds; longitude East 147 degrees 13  minutes 10 seconds. There the river contained some deep pools and we  expected to catch fish; but Piper told us that the holes had been  recently poisoned, a process adopted by the natives in dry seasons, when  the river no longer flows, for bringing the fish to the surface of deep  ponds and thus killing the whole; I need not add that none of us got a  bite. All these holes were full of recently cut boughs of the eucalyptus,  so that the water was tinged black.    ASCEND HURD'S PEAK.    April 5.    As soon as the party had started I gave the overseer the bearings and  distances to be pursued; while I proceeded to the cone named Hurd's peak  by Oxley, but by the natives Tolga. It was distant about four miles from  our line of route. A low ridge of quartz rock extends from the Goobang to  this peak the base of which consists of chlorite slate, and its summit of  squarish pebbles of quartz, with the angles rounded, associated with  fragments of chlorite slate. There was just convenient room on it for the  theodolite and, as it afforded a most satisfactory and commanding view,  well suited for the purpose of surveying, it seemed to have been aptly  named after a distinguished geographer. Many points of a distant range  now appeared on the north-western horizon in the direction of Oxley's  Mount Granard, and the ridge of Bolloon (towards the great lake  Cudjallagong) seemed not very distant. I took angles on all the points  and then hastened to overtake the party, which I did after they had  travelled about nine miles. At fourteen miles we made the banks of the  Lachlan, and encamped by the side of it on the edge of a plain in  latitude 33 degrees 4 minutes 38 seconds South, longitude 147 degrees  East. Judging by the relative position of Hurd's peak etc., I supposed it  might have been about this place that Oxley's party crossed to the right  bank of the river on his return towards Wellington valley. No traces  however were discovered by us here of the first explorers of the Lachlan.    April 6.    The night had been mild and clear and the sun rose in a cloudless sky. We  traversed plains of firmer surface than those crossed on the previous  day. So early even as nine o'clock the heat was oppressive.    SNAKE AND BIRD.    On one of these plains I witnessed an instance of the peculiar  fascination attributed to the serpent race. A large snake, lying at"]]]
