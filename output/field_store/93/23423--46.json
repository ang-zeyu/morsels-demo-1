Each of the Biblical narrators seems to be seeking also by means of  these illustrations to teach certain universal moral and religious  truths.  In this respect the two variant Biblical narratives are in  perfect agreement.  The destruction of mankind came not as the fiat  of an arbitrary Deity, but because of the purpose which God had  before him in the work of creation, and because that purpose was  good.  Men by their sins and wilful failure to observe his benign  laws were thwarting that purpose.  Hence in accord with the just  laws of the universe their destruction was unavoidable, and it came  even as effect follows cause.  On the other hand, these ancient  teachers taught with inimitable skill that God would not destroy  that which was worthy of preservation.    In each of the accounts the character of Noah stands in striking  contrast with those of his contemporaries.  The story as told is  not merely an illustration of the truth that righteousness brings  its just reward, but of the profounder principle that it is the  morally fit who survive.  In both of the versions Noah in a very  true sense represents the beginning of a new creation: he is the  traditional father of a better race.  To him are given the promises  which God was eager to realize in the life of humanity.  In the  poetic fancy of the ancient East even the resplendent rainbow,  which proclaimed the return of the sun after the storm, was truly  interpreted as evidence of God's fatherly love and care for his  children.  In the light of these profound religious teachings may  any one reasonably question the right of these stories to a place  in the Bible?  Did not Jesus himself frequently use illustrations  drawn from earlier history or from nature to make clear his  teachings?  Is it not evidence of superlative teaching skill to use  that which is familiar and, therefore, of interest to those taught,  in order to inculcate the deeper moral and religious truths of life?      V.    SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN THE NATURAL WORLD.    It is interesting and illuminating to note how the ancient Hebrew  prophets in their religious teaching forecast the discoveries and  scientific methods of our day.  This was because they had grasped  universal principles.    Since the memorable evening in July, 1858, in which the views of  Darwin and Wallace on the principles of variation and selection in  the natural world were sent to the Linnaean Society in London, the  leading scientists have laid great stress upon the doctrine of the  survival of the \"fittest\" as the true explanation of progress in  the natural world.  It was apparently made clear by Darwin, and  supported by sufficient evidence, that \"any being, if it vary  however slightly, in any manner profitable to itself, under the  complex and somewhat varying conditions of life, will have a better  chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.\"    This principle, since that day, has been thoroughly worked out in  practically all the important fields of both the plant and animal  world.  Moreover, the doctrine of evolution, dependent upon this  principle, has exerted so great an influence upon the process of  investigation and thinking in all fields of activity that the  resulting change in method has amounted to a revolution.  The  principle is applied not only in the field of biology, but also in  the realm of astronomy, where we study the evolution of worlds, and  in psychology, history, social science, where we speak of the  development of human traits and of the growth of economic,  political and social institutions.    It is necessary to remember in applying such a brief statement of a  principle, that the words are used in a highly technical sense.  The word \"fittest\" by no means need imply the best from the point  of view of beauty or strength or usefulness in nature; nor does it  necessarily mean, in reference to society, best from the point of  view of morals or a higher civilization.  Rather the \"fittest\"  means the being best adapted to the conditions under which it is  living, or to its environment.  As a matter of fact, it is the  general opinion that in practically all fields this principle works  toward progress in the highest and best sense; but it is always a  matter for specific study as well as of great scientific interest  and importance, to determine where and how the variation and the  corresponding selection tend to promote the morally good.  Especially is this true in the study of society, where we should  endeavor to see whether or not the \"fittest\" means also the highest  from the moral and religious point of view.    The story of the flood gives us a most interesting example of the  way in which the ancient Hebrews looked upon such a process of  selection in the moral and religious world and taught it as a  divine principle.  It is, therefore, one of the most suggestive and  interesting of the writings of the early Israelites.      VI.    THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE.    From our modern point of view, the ancient Hebrew writers had a far  deeper knowledge of moral and religious questions than of natural  science.  They had a far keener sense of what was socially  beneficial than of what was scientifically true.  However we may  estimate their knowledge of geology and biology, we must grant that  their beliefs regarding the good and ill effects of human action  have in them much that is universally true, even though we may not  follow them throughout in their theories of divine wrath and  immediate earthly punishment of the wicked.    But is it not true almost invariably, if we look at social  questions of every kind in a comprehensive way, that the survival  of the fittest means the survival of the morally best?  That the  religion which endures is of the highest type?  Business success in  the long run, is so strongly based upon mutual confidence and  trust, that, especially in these later days of credit organization,  the dishonest man or even the tricky man cannot prosper long.  A  sales manager of a prominent institution said lately that the chief  difficulty that he had with his men was to make them always tell  the truth.  For the sake of making an important sale they were  often inclined to misrepresent his goods.  \"But nothing,\" he added,  \"will so surely kill all business as misrepresentation.\"  Even a  gambling book-maker on the race tracks in New York, before such  work was forbidden by law, is said to have proudly claimed that  absolute justice and honesty toward his customers was essential to  his success and had therefore become the rule of his life.  Although it is sometimes said that the man who guides his life by  the maxim, \"Honesty is the best policy,\" is in reality not honest  at heart, it must nevertheless be granted that in business the  survival of the fittest means the survival of the most honest  business man.    It may perhaps have been true in the days of Machiavelli that  cruelty and treachery would aid the unscrupulous petty despot of  Italy to secure and at times to maintain his dukedom; but certainly  in modern days, when in all civilized countries permanently  prosperous government is based ultimately upon the will of the  people, the successful ruler can no longer be treacherous and  cruel.  Even among our so-called \"spoils\" politicians and corrupt  bosses, who hold their positions by playing upon the selfishness of  their followers and the ignorance and apathy of the public, there  must be rigid faithfulness to promises, and, at any rate, the  appearance of promoting the public welfare.  Otherwise their term  of power is short.    If we look back through the history of modern times, we shall find  that the statesmen who rank high among the successful rulers of  their countries are men of unselfish patriotism, and almost  invariably men of personal uprightness and morality, and usually of  deep religious feeling.  Think over the names of the great men of  the United States, and note their characters.  Pick out the leading  statesmen of the last half century in England, Germany and Italy.  Do they not all stand for unselfish, patriotic purpose in their  actions, and in character for individual honor and integrity?    The same is true in our social intercourse.  Brilliancy of  intellect, however important in many fields of activity, counts for  relatively little in home and social life, if not accompanied by  graciousness of manner, kindness of heart, uprightness of  character.  It may sometimes seem that the brilliant rascal  succeeds, that the unscrupulous business man becomes rich, and that  the hypocrite prospers through his hypocrisy.  If all society were  made up of men of these low moral types, would such cases perhaps  be more often found than now?  In a society of hypocrites, would  the fittest for survival be the most skilful deceiver?  Or, even  there, would the adage, \"There must be honor among thieves,\" hold,  when it came to permanent organization?  But, whatever your answer,  society fortunately is not made up of hypocrites or rascals of any  kind.  With all the weakness of human nature found in every  society, the growing success of the rule of the people throughout  the world proves that fundamentally men and women are honest and  true.  Generally common human nature is for the right.  Almost  universally, if a mooted question touching morals can be put simply  and squarely before the people, they will see and choose the right.    Fortunate it is for the world that the lessons taught by the early  Hebrew writers regarding the survival of the moral and upright are  true, and that good sense and religion both agree that in the long  run,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#8)"],[1,"room, but the eye of the doctor held him, unwilling. And there  began once more that eternal waiting, waiting, waiting, which was the  horror of the place, until the faint creakings through the windshaken  house took on the meaning of footsteps stalking down the hall and  pausing at the door, and there was the hushing breath of one who  listened and smiled to himself! Now the doctor became aware that the eye  of Buck Daniels was widening, brightening; it was as if the mind of the  big man were giving way in the strain. His face blanched. Even the lips  had no colour, and they moved, gibberingly.    \"Listen!\" he said.    \"It is the wind,\" answered the doctor, but his voice was hardly audible.    \"Listen!\" commanded Daniels again.    The doctor could hear it then. It was a pulse of sound obscure as the  thudding of his heart. But it was a human sound and it made his throat  close up tightly, as if a hand were settling around his wind-pipe. Buck  Daniels rose from his chair; that half-mad, half-listening look was  still in his eyes--behind his eyes. Staring at him the doctor  understood, intimately, how men can throw their lives away gloriously in  battle, fighting for an idea; or how they can commit secret and foul  murder. Yet he was more afraid of that pulse of sound than of the face  of Buck Daniels. He, also, was rising from his chair, and when Daniels  stalked to the side door of the room and leaned there, the doctor  followed.    Then they could hear it clearly. There was a note of music in the voice;  it was a woman weeping in that room where the chain lay on the floor,  coiled loosely like a snake. Buck Daniels straightened and moved away  from the door. He began to laugh, guarding it so that not a whisper  could break outside the room, and his silent laughter was the most  horrible thing the doctor had ever seen. It was only for a moment. The  hysteria passed and left the big man shaking like a dead leaf.    \"Doc,\" he said, \"I can't stand it no longer. I'm going out and try to  get him back here. And God forgive me for it.\"    He left the room, slamming the door behind him, and then he stamped down  the hall as if he were trying to make a companion out of his noise.  Doctor Randall Byrne sat down to put his thoughts in order. He began at  the following point: \"The physical fact is not; only the immaterial is.\"  But before he had carried very far his deductions from this premise, he  caught the neighing of a horse near the house; so he went to the window  and threw it open. At the same time he heard the rattle of galloping  hoofs, and then he saw a horseman riding furiously into the heart of the  wind. Almost at once the rider was lost from sight.          CHAPTER VII    JERRY STRANN      The wrath of the Lord seems less terrible when it is localised, and the  world at large gave thanks daily that the range of Jerry Strann was  limited to the Three B's. As everyone in the mountain-desert knows, the  Three B's are Bender, Buckskin, and Brownsville; they make the points of  a loose triangle that is cut with canyons and tumbled with mountains,  and that triangle was the chosen stamping ground of Jerry Strann. Jerry  was not born in the region of the Three B's and why it should have been  chosen specially by him was matter which the inhabitants could not  puzzle out; but they felt that for their sins the Lord had probably put  his wrath among them in the form of Jerry Strann.    He was only twenty-four, this Jerry, but he was already grown into a  proverb. Men of the Three B's reckoned their conversational dates by the  visits of the youth; if a storm hung over the mountains someone might  remark: \"It looks like Jerry Strann is coming,\" and such a remark was  always received in gloomy silence; mothers had been known to hush their  children by chanting: \"Jerry Strann will get you if you don't watch  out.\" Yet he was not an ogre with a red knife between his teeth. He  stood at exactly the perfect romantic height; he was just six feet tall;  he was as graceful as a young cotton-wood in a windstorm and he was as  strong and tough as the roots of the mesquite. He was one of those rare  men who are beautiful without being unmanly. His face was modelled with  the care a Praxiteles would lavish on a Phoebus. His brown hair was  thick and dark and every touch of wind stirred it, and his hazel eyes  were brilliant with an enduring light--the inextinguishable joy of life.    Consider that there was no malice in Jerry Strann. But he loved strife  as the young Apollo loved strife--or a pure-blooded bull terrier. He  fought with distinction and grace and abandon and was perfectly willing  to use fists or knives or guns at the pleasure of the other contracting  party. In another age, with armour and a golden chain and spurs, Jerry  Strann would have been--but why think of that? Swords are not  forty-fives, and the Twentieth Century is not the Thirteenth. He was, in  fact, born just six hundred years too late. From his childhood he had  thirsted for battle as other children thirst for milk: and now he rode  anything on hoofs and threw a knife like a Mexican--with either  hand--and at short range he did snap shooting with two revolvers that  made rifle experts sick at heart.    However, the men of the Three B's, as everyone understands, are not  gentle or long-enduring, and you will wonder why this young destroyer  was allowed to range at large so long. There was a vital reason. Up in  the mountains lived Mac Strann, the hermit-trapper, who hated everything  in the wide world except his young brother, the beautiful, wild, and  sunny Jerry Strann. And Mac Strann loved his brother as much as he hated  everything else; it is impossible to state it more strongly. It was not  long before the men of the Three B's discovered how Mac Strann felt  about his brother. After Jerry's famous Hallowe'en party in Buckskin,  for instance, Williamson, McKenna, and Rath started out to rid the  country of the disturber. They went out to hunt him as men go out to  hunt a wild mustang. And they caught him and bent him down--those three  stark men--and he lay in bed for a month; but before the month was over  Mac Strann came down from his mountain and went to Buckskin and gathered  Williamson and McKenna and Rath in one public place. And when the  morning came Williamson and McKenna and Rath had left this vale of tears  and Mac Strann was back on his mountain. He was not even arrested. For  there was a devilish cunning about the fellow and he made his victims,  without exception, attack him first; then he destroyed them, suddenly  and surely, and retreated to his lair. Things like this happened once or  twice and then the men of the Three B's understood that it was not wise  to lay plots for Jerry Strann. They accepted him, as I have said before,  as men accept the wrath of God.    Let it not be thought that Jerry Strann was a solitary like his brother.  When he went out for a frolic the young men of the community gathered  around him, for Jerry paid all scores and the red-eye flowed in his path  like wine before the coming of Bacchus; where Jerry went there was never  a dull moment, and young men love action. So it happened that when he  rode into Brownsville this day he was the leader of a cavalcade. Rumour  rode before them, and doors were locked and windows were darkened, and  men sat in the darkness within with their guns across their knees. For  Brownsville lay at the extreme northern tip of the triangle and it was  rarely visited by Jerry; and it is well established that men fear the  unfamiliar more than the known.    As has been said, Jerry headed the train of revellers, partially because  it was most unwise to cut in ahead of Jerry and partially because there  was not a piece of horseflesh in the Three B's which could outfoot his  chestnut. It was a gelding out of the loins of the north wind and sired  by the devil himself, and its spirit was one with the spirit of Jerry  Strann; perhaps because they both served one master. The cavalcade came  with a crash of racing hoofs in a cloud of dust. But in the middle of  the street Jerry raised his right arm stiffly overhead with a whoop and  brought his chestnut to a sliding stop; the cloud of dust rolled lazily  on ahead. The young men gathered quickly around the leader, and there  was silence as they waited for him to speak--a silence broken only by  the wheezing of the horses, and the stench of sweating horseflesh was  in every man's nostrils.    \"Who owns that hoss?\" asked Jerry Strann, and pointed.    He had stopped just opposite O'Brien's hotel, store, blacksmith shop,  and saloon, and by the hitching rack was a black stallion. Now, there  are some men who carry tidings of their inward strength stamped on their  foreheads and written in their eyes. In times of crises crowds will turn  to such men and follow them as soldiers follow a captain; for it is  patent at a glance that this is a man of men. It is likewise true that  there are horses which stand out among their fellows, and this was such  a horse. He was such a creature that, if he had been led to a barrier,  the entire crowd at the race track would rise as one man and say: \"What  is that horse?\" There were points in which some critics would find  fault; most of the men of the mountain-desert, for instance, would have  said that the animal was too lightly and delicately limbed for long  endurance; but as the man of men bears the stamp of his greatness in his  forehead and his eyes, so it was with the black stallion. When the  thunder of the cavalcade had rushed upon him down the street he had  turned with catlike grace and raised his head to see; and his forehead  and his eyes arrested Jerry Strann like a levelled rifle. Looking at  that proud head one forgot the body of the horse, the symmetry of curves  exquisite beyond the sculptor's dream, the arching neck and the steel  muscles; one was only conscious of the great spirit."]]]
