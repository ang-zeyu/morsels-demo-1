The maid Rebekah ran and told at home all that she had heard.  Rebekah had a brother named Laban, which hastily went out to the man  where as he was when he had seen the rings in his sister's ears and her  poinettes or armlets on her hands; and had heard her say all that the  man said. He came to the man that stood by the well yet, and said to  him: Come in, thou blessed of God, why standest thou without? I have  made ready the house for thee, and have ordained place for thy camels.  And brought him in, and strawed his camels, and gave them chaff and hay,  and water to wash the camels' feet, and the men's feet that came with  him.    And they set forth bread tofore him, which said: I shall not eat till I  have done mine errand and said wherefore I am come. And it was answered  to him, say on, and he said: I am servant of Abraham, and God hath  blessed and magnified him greatly and hath given to him oxen and sheep,  silver and gold, servants men and women, camels and asses. And Sarah his  wife hath brought him forth a son in her old age, and he hath given to  him all that he had. And my lord hath charged and adjured me saying: In  no wise let my son Isaac have no wife of the daughters of Canaan in  whose land he dwelleth, but go unto the house of my father and of my  kindred, and of them thou shall take a wife to my son, wherefore I am  come hither. And told all how he prayed God of some token, and how  Rebekah did to him, and in conclusion desired to have Rebekah for his  lord Isaac; and if he would not, that he might depart and go into some  other place, on the right side or on the left, to seek a wife for his  lord's son. Then Bethuel and Laban said to him: This word is come of  God, against his will we may nothing do. Lo! Rebekah standeth tofore  thee, take her and go forth that she may be wife unto the son of thy  lord, as our Lord hath said. Which words when Abraham's servant had  heard, he fell down to the ground and thanked our Lord, and anon took  forth silver vessels and of gold and good clothes and gave them to  Rebekah for a gift. And to her brethren and mother he gave also gifts,  and anon they made a feast, and ate and were joyful together. On the  morn betimes, the servant of Abraham arose, and desired to depart and  take Rebekah with him and go to his lord. Then the mother and her  brethren said: Let the maid abide with us but only ten days, and then  take her and go thy way. I pray you, said he, retain ne let [hinder] me  not, our Lord hath addressed my way and achieved my errand, wherefore  let me go to my lord. And they said: We shall call the maid and know her  will; and when she was demanded if she would go with that man, she said:  Yea, I shall go with him. Then they let her go, and her nurse with her,  and so she departed, and they said to her: Thou art our sister, we pray  God that thou mayst increase into a thousand thousand, and that thy seed  may possess the gates of their enemies. Then Rebekah and her maidens  ascended upon the camels, and followed the servant of Abraham which  hastily returned unto his lord.    That same time, when they were come, Isaac walked by the way without  forth and looked up and saw the camels coming from far. Rebekah espied  him and demanded of the servant who that he was that came in the field  against them. He answered and said: That is my lord Isaac, and anon she  took her pall or mantle and covered her. The servant anon told unto his  lord Isaac all that he had done; which received her and led her into the  tabernacle of Sarah his mother and wedded her, and took her in to his  wife, and so much loved her, that the love attempered the sorrow that he  had for his mother. Abraham after this wedded another wife, by whom he  had divers children. Abraham gave to Isaac all his possessions, and to  his other children he gave movable goods, and departed the sons of his  concubines from his son Isaac whilst he yet lived. And all the days of  the life of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five years, and then  died in good mind and age, and Isaac and Ishmael buried him by his wife  Sarah in a double spelunke [cave].          HERE BEGINNETH THE LIFE OF ISAAC    WITH THE HISTORY OF ESAU AND OF JACOB    _Which is read in the Church the Second Sunday in Lent_      Isaac was forty years old when he wedded Rebekah and she bare him no  children. Wherefore he besought our Lord that she might bring forth  fruit. Our Lord heard his prayer, and she had twain sons at once. The  first was rough from the head to the foot, and he was named Esau; and  the other was named Jacob. Isaac the father was sixty years old when  these children were born. And after this, when they were grown to  reasonable age, Esau became a ploughman, and a tiller of the earth, and  an hunter. And Jacob was simple and dwelled at home with his mother.  Isaac the father loved well Esau, because he ate oft of the venison that  Esau took, and Rebekah the mother loved Jacob.    Jacob on a time had made a good pottage, and Esau his brother had been  an hunting all day and came home sore an hungred, and found Jacob having  good pottage, and prayed him to give him some, for he was weary and much  hungry. To whom Jacob said: If thou wilt sell to me thy patrimony and  heritage I shall give thee some pottage. And Esau answered, Lo! I die  for hunger, what shall avail me mine inheritance if I die, and what  shall profit me my patrimony? I am content that thou take it for this  pottage. Jacob then said: Swear that to me thou shalt never claim it,  and that thou art content I shall enjoy it, and Esau sware it, and so  sold away his patrimony, and took the pottage and ate it, and went his  way, setting nothing thereby that he had sold his patrimony. This  aforesaid is to bring in my matter of the history that is read, for now  followeth the legend as it is read in the church.    Isaac began to wax old and his eyes failed and dimmed that he might not  clearly see. And on a time he called Esau his oldest son and said to  him: Son mine, which answered: Father, I am here ready, to whom the  father said: Behold that I wax old and know not the day that I shall die  and depart out of this world, wherefore take thine harness, thy bow and  quiver with tackles, and go forth an hunting, and when thou hast taken  any venison, make to me thereof such manner meat as thou knowest that I  am wont to eat, and bring it to me that I may eat it, and that my soul  may bless thee ere I die. Which all these words Rebekah heard. And Esau  went forth for to accomplish the commandment of his father, and she said  then to Jacob: I have heard thy father say to Esau, thy brother: Bring  to me of thy venison, and make thereof meat that I may eat, and that I  may bless thee tofore our Lord ere I die. Now my son, take heed to my  counsel, and go forth to the flock, and bring to me two the best kids  that thou canst find, and I shall make of them meat such as thy father  shall gladly eat, which when thou hast brought to him and hast eaten he  may bless thee ere he die: To whom Jacob answered: Knowest thou not that  my brother is rough and hairy and I am smooth? If my father take me to  him and taste me and feel, I dread me that he shall think that I mock  him, and shall give me his curse for the blessing. The mother then said  to him: In me, said she, be this curse, my son, nevertheless hear me; go  to the flock and do that I have said to thee. He went and fetched the  kids and delivered them to his mother, and she went and ordained them  into such meat as she knew well that his father loved, and took the best  clothes that Esau had, and did them on Jacob. And the skins of the kid  she did about his neck and hands there as he was bare, and delivered to  him bread and the pulment that she had boiled. And he went to his father  and said: Father mine, and he answered: I am here; who art thou, my son?  Jacob said: I am Esau, thy first begotten son, I have done as thou  commandedst me, arise, sit and eat of the venison of my hunting that thy  soul may bless me. Then said Isaac again to his son: How mightest thou,  said he, so soon find and take it, my son? To whom he answered: It was  the will of God that such thing as I desired came soon to my hand. Isaac  said to him: Come hither to me, my son, that I may touch and handle  thee, that I may prove whether thou be my son Esau or not. He came to  his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice truly is the  voice of Jacob, but the hands be the hands of Esau. And he knew him not,  for his hands expressed the likeness and similitude of the more  brother. Therefore blessing him, he said to him: Thou art then my son  Esau? He answered and said: I am he. Then said Isaac: Bring to the meat  of thine hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee; which he offered  and gave to his father, and also wine. And when he had eaten and drunken  a good draught of the wine, he said to Jacob: Come hither to me, my son,  and kiss me; and he went to him and kissed him. Anon as he felt the  sweet savour and smell of his clothes, blessing him he said: Lo! the  sweet odour of my son is as the odour of a field full of flowers, whom  our Lord bless. God give to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the  fatness of the earth, abundance of wheat, wine, and oil, and the people  serve thee, and the tribes worship thee. Be thou lord of thy brethren,  and the sons of thy mother shall bow down and kneel to thee. Whosomever  curseth thee, be he accursed, and who that blesseth thee, with blessings  be he fulfilled.    Unnethe [hardly] had Isaac fulfilled these words and Jacob gone out,  when that Esau came with his meat that he had gotten with hunting,  entered in, and offered to his father saying: Arise, father mine, and  eat of the venison that thy son hath ordained for thee, that thy soul  may bless me. Isaac said to him: Who art thou?

The Spanish n [ny] is employed     to denote this sound, and Ngami is spelt nyami--naka means a tusk,     nyaka a doctor.  Every vowel is sounded in all native words,     and the emphasis in pronunciation is put upon the penultimate.    Returning to Kuruman, in order to bring my luggage to our proposed  settlement, I was followed by the news that the tribe of Bakwains,  who had shown themselves so friendly toward me, had been driven from  Lepelole by the Barolongs, so that my prospects for the time of forming  a settlement there were at an end. One of those periodical outbreaks  of war, which seem to have occurred from time immemorial, for the  possession of cattle, had burst forth in the land, and had so changed  the relations of the tribes to each other, that I was obliged to set out  anew to look for a suitable locality for a mission station.    In going north again, a comet blazed on our sight, exciting the  wonder of every tribe we visited. That of 1816 had been followed by an  irruption of the Matebele, the most cruel enemies the Bechuanas ever  knew, and this they thought might portend something as bad, or it might  only foreshadow the death of some great chief. On this subject of comets  I knew little more than they did themselves, but I had that confidence  in a kind, overruling Providence, which makes such a difference between  Christians and both the ancient and modern heathen.    As some of the Bamangwato people had accompanied me to Kuruman, I was  obliged to restore them and their goods to their chief Sekomi. This made  a journey to the residence of that chief again necessary, and, for the  first time, I performed a distance of some hundred miles on ox-back.    Returning toward Kuruman, I selected the beautiful valley of Mabotsa  (lat. 25d 14' south, long. 26d 30'?) as the site of a missionary  station, and thither I removed in 1843. Here an occurrence took place  concerning which I have frequently been questioned in England, and  which, but for the importunities of friends, I meant to have kept in  store to tell my children when in my dotage. The Bakatla of the village  Mabotsa were much troubled by lions, which leaped into the cattle-pens  by night, and destroyed their cows. They even attacked the herds in open  day. This was so unusual an occurrence that the people believed that  they were bewitched--\"given,\" as they said, \"into the power of the lions  by a neighboring tribe.\" They went once to attack the animals, but,  being rather a cowardly people compared to Bechuanas in general on such  occasions, they returned without killing any.    It is well known that if one of a troop of lions is killed, the others  take the hint and leave that part of the country. So, the next time the  herds were attacked, I went with the people, in order to encourage them  to rid themselves of the annoyance by destroying one of the marauders.  We found the lions on a small hill about a quarter of a mile in length,  and covered with trees. A circle of men was formed round it, and they  gradually closed up, ascending pretty near to each other. Being down  below on the plain with a native schoolmaster, named Mebalwe, a most  excellent man, I saw one of the lions sitting on a piece of rock within  the now closed circle of men. Mebalwe fired at him before I could, and  the ball struck the rock on which the animal was sitting. He bit at  the spot struck, as a dog does at a stick or stone thrown at him; then  leaping away, broke through the opening circle and escaped unhurt. The  men were afraid to attack him, perhaps on account of their belief in  witchcraft. When the circle was re-formed, we saw two other lions in  it; but we were afraid to fire lest we should strike the men, and they  allowed the beasts to burst through also. If the Bakatla had acted  according to the custom of the country, they would have speared the  lions in their attempt to get out. Seeing we could not get them to kill  one of the lions, we bent our footsteps toward the village; in going  round the end of the hill, however, I saw one of the beasts sitting on  a piece of rock as before, but this time he had a little bush in front.  Being about thirty yards off, I took a good aim at his body through the  bush, and fired both barrels into it. The men then called out, \"He is  shot, he is shot!\" Others cried, \"He has been shot by another man too;  let us go to him!\" I did not see any one else shoot at him, but I saw  the lion's tail erected in anger behind the bush, and, turning to the  people, said, \"Stop a little, till I load again.\" When in the act of  ramming down the bullets, I heard a shout. Starting, and looking half  round, I saw the lion just in the act of springing upon me. I was upon  a little height; he caught my shoulder as he sprang, and we both came to  the ground below together. Growling horribly close to my ear, he shook  me as a terrier dog does a rat. The shock produced a stupor similar to  that which seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of the cat.  It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was no sense of pain nor  feeling of terror, though quite conscious of all that was happening.  It was like what patients partially under the influence of chloroform  describe, who see all the operation, but feel not the knife. This  singular condition was not the result of any mental process. The shake  annihilated fear, and allowed no sense of horror in looking round at the  beast. This peculiar state is probably produced in all animals killed  by the carnivora; and if so, is a merciful provision by our benevolent  Creator for lessening the pain of death. Turning round to relieve myself  of the weight, as he had one paw on the back of my head, I saw his eyes  directed to Mebalwe, who was trying to shoot him at a distance of ten  or fifteen yards. His gun, a flint one, missed fire in both barrels; the  lion immediately left me, and, attacking Mebalwe, bit his thigh. Another  man, whose life I had saved before, after he had been tossed by a  buffalo, attempted to spear the lion while he was biting Mebalwe. He  left Mebalwe and caught this man by the shoulder, but at that moment the  bullets he had received took effect, and he fell down dead. The whole  was the work of a few moments, and must have been his paroxysms of  dying rage. In order to take out the charm from him, the Bakatla on the  following day made a huge bonfire over the carcass, which was declared  to be that of the largest lion they had ever seen. Besides crunching the  bone into splinters, he left eleven teeth wounds on the upper part of my  arm.    A wound from this animal's tooth resembles a gun-shot wound; it is  generally followed by a great deal of sloughing and discharge, and pains  are felt in the part periodically ever afterward. I had on a tartan  jacket on the occasion, and I believe that it wiped off all the virus  from the teeth that pierced the flesh, for my two companions in this  affray have both suffered from the peculiar pains, while I have escaped  with only the inconvenience of a false joint in my limb. The man whose  shoulder was wounded showed me his wound actually burst forth afresh on  the same month of the following year. This curious point deserves the  attention of inquirers.    The different Bechuana tribes are named after certain animals, showing  probably that in former times they were addicted to animal-worship like  the ancient Egyptians. The term Bakatla means \"they of the monkey\";  Bakuena, \"they of the alligator\"; Batlapi, \"they of the fish\": each  tribe having a superstitious dread of the animal after which it is  called. They also use the word \"bina\", to dance, in reference to the  custom of thus naming themselves, so that, when you wish to ascertain  what tribe they belong to, you say, \"What do you dance?\" It would seem  as if that had been a part of the worship of old. A tribe never eats the  animal which is its namesake, using the term \"ila\", hate or dread, in  reference to killing it. We find traces of many ancient tribes in the  country in individual members of those now extinct, as the Batau, \"they  of the lion\"; the Banoga, \"they of the serpent\"; though no such tribes  now exist. The use of the personal pronoun they, Ba-Ma, Wa, Va or Ova,  Am-Ki, &c., prevails very extensively in the names of tribes in Africa.  A single individual is indicated by the terms Mo or Le. Thus Mokwain is  a single person of the Bakwain tribe, and Lekoa is a single white man or  Englishman--Makoa being Englishmen.    I attached myself to the tribe called Bakuena or Bakwains, the chief of  which, named Sechele, was then living with his people at a place called  Shokuane. I was from the first struck by his intelligence, and by  the marked manner in which we both felt drawn to each other. As this  remarkable man has not only embraced Christianity, but expounds its  doctrines to his people, I will here give a brief sketch of his career.    His great-grandfather Mochoasele was a great traveler, and the first  that ever told the Bakwains of the existence of white men. In his  father's lifetime two white travelers, whom I suppose to have been Dr.  Cowan and Captain Donovan, passed through the country (in 1808), and,  descending the River Limpopo, were, with their party, all cut off by  fever. The rain-makers there, fearing lest their wagons might drive away  the rain, ordered them to be thrown into the river. This is the true  account of the end of that expedition, as related to me by the son of  the chief at whose village they perished. He remembered, when a boy,  eating part of one of the horses, and said it tasted like zebra's flesh.  Thus they were not killed by the Bangwaketse, as reported, for they  passed the Bakwains all well. The Bakwains were then rich in cattle; and  as one of the many evidences of the desiccation"]]]
