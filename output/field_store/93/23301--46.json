And he realized also that since he had  last looked closely at Terence the latter had slipped out of boyhood and  into manhood. There was that indescribable something about the set of the  chin and the straight-looking eyes that spelled the difference.    \"Terence,\" she said, \"for twenty-four years you have been my boy.\"    \"Yes, Aunt Elizabeth.\"    He acknowledged the gravity of this opening statement by straightening a  little, his hand falling away from the stone against which he had been  leaning. But Vance looked more closely at his sister. He could see the  gleam of worship in her eyes.    \"And now I want you to be something more. I want you to be my boy in the  eyes of the law, so that when anything happens to me, your place won't be  threatened.\"    He was straighter than ever.    \"I want to adopt you, Terence!\"    Somehow, in those few moments they had been gradually building to a  climax. It was prodigiously heightened now by the silence of the boy. The  throat of Vance tightened with excitement.    \"I will be your mother, in the eyes of the law,\" she was explaining  gently, as though it were a mystery which Terry could not understand.  \"And Vance, here, will be your uncle. You understand, my dear?\"    What a world of brooding tenderness went into her voice! Vance wondered  at it. But he wondered more at the stiff-standing form of Terence, and  his silence; until he saw the tender smile vanish from the face of  Elizabeth and alarm come into it. All at once Terence had dropped to one  knee before her and taken her hands. And now it was he who was talking  slowly, gently.    \"All my life you've given me things, Aunt Elizabeth. You've given me  everything. Home, happiness, love--everything that could be given. So  much that you could never be repaid, and all I can do is to love you, you  see, and honor you as if you were my mother, in fact. But there's just  one thing that can't be given. And that's a name!\"    He paused. Elizabeth was listening with a stricken face, and the heart of  Vance thundered with his excitement. Vaguely he felt that there was  something fine and clean and honorable in the heart of this youth which  was being laid bare; but about that he cared very little. He was getting  at facts and emotions which were valuable to him in the terms of dollars  and cents.    \"It makes me choke up,\" said Terence, \"to have you offer me this great  thing. It's a fine name, Cornish. But you know that I can't do it. It  would be cowardly--a sort of rotten treason for me to change. It would be  wrong. I know it would be wrong. I'm a Colby, Aunt Elizabeth. Every time  that name is spoken, I feel it tingling down to my fingertips. I want to  stand straighter, live cleaner. When I looked at the old Colby place in  Virginia last year, it brought the tears to my eyes. I felt as if I were  a product of that soil. Every fine thing that has ever been done by a  Colby is a strength to me. I've studied them. And every now and then when  I come to some brave thing they've done, I wonder if I could do it. And  then I say to myself that I _must_ be able to do just such things or else  be a shame to my blood.    \"Change my name? Why, I've gone all my life thanking God that I come of a  race of gentlemen, clean-handed, and praying God to make me worthy of it.  That name is like a whip over me. It drives me on and makes me want to do  some fine big thing one of these days. Think of it! I'm the last of a  race. I'm the end of it. The last of the Colbys! Why, when you think of  it, you see how I can't possibly change, don't you? If I lost that, I'd  lose the best half of myself and my self-respect! You understand, don't  you? Not that I slight the name of Cornish for an instant. But even if  names can be changed, blood can't be changed!\"    She turned her head. She met the gleaming eyes of Vance, and then let her  glance probe the fire and shadow of the hearth.    \"It's all right, my dear,\" she said faintly. \"Stand up.\"    \"I've hurt you,\" he said contritely, leaning over her. \"I feel--like a  dog. Have I hurt you?\"    \"Not the least in the world. I only offered it for your happiness, Terry.  And if you don't need it, there's no more to be said!\"    He bent and kissed her forehead.    The moment he had disappeared through the tall doorway, Vance, past  control, exploded.    \"Of all the damnable exhibitions of pride in a young upstart, this--\"    \"Hush, hush!\" said Elizabeth faintly. \"It's the finest thing I've ever  heard Terry say. But it frightens me, Vance. It frightens me to know that  I've formed the character and the pride and the self-respect of that boy  on--a lie! Pray God that he never learns the truth!\"        CHAPTER 7      There were not many guests. Elizabeth had chosen them carefully from  families which had known her father, Henry Cornish, when, in his  reckless, adventurous way, he had been laying the basis of the Cornish  fortune in the Rockies. Indeed, she was a little angry when she heard of  the indiscriminate way in which Vance had scattered the invitations,  particularly in Craterville.    But, as he said, he had acted so as to show her that he had entered fully  into the spirit of the thing, and that his heart was in the right place  as far as this birthday party was concerned, and she could not do  otherwise than accept his explanation.    Some of the bidden guests, however, came from a great distance, and as a  matter of course a few of them arrived the day before the celebration and  filled the quiet rooms of the old house with noise. Elizabeth accepted  them with resignation, and even pleasure, because they all had pleasant  things to say about her father and good wishes to express for the  destined heir, Terence Colby. It was carefully explained that this  selection of an heir had been made by both Elizabeth and Vance, which  removed all cause for remark. Vance himself regarded the guests with  distinct amusement. But Terence was disgusted.    \"What these true Westerners need,\" he said to Elizabeth later in the day,  \"is a touch of blood. No feeling of family or the dignity of family  precedents out here.\"    It touched her shrewdly. More than once she had felt that Terry was on  the verge of becoming a complacent prig. So she countered with a sharp  thrust.    \"You have to remember that you're a Westerner born and bred, my dear. A  very Westerner yourself!\"    \"Birth is an accident--birthplaces, I mean,\" smiled Terence. \"It's the  blood that tells.\"    \"Terry, you're a snob!\" exclaimed Aunt Elizabeth.    \"I hope not,\" he answered. \"But look yonder, now!\"    Old George Armstrong's daughter, Nelly, had gone up a tree like a  squirrel and was laughing down through the branches at a raw-boned cousin  on the ground beneath her.    \"And what of it?\" said Elizabeth. \"That girl is pretty enough to please  any man; and she's the type that makes a wife.\"    Terry rubbed his chin with his knuckles thoughtfully. It was the one  family habit that he had contracted from Vance, much to the irritation of  the latter.    \"After all,\" said Terry, with complacency, \"what are good looks with bad  grammar?\"    Elizabeth snorted literally and most unfemininely.    \"Terence,\" she said, lessoning him with her bony, long forefinger,  \"you're just young enough to be wise about women. When you're a little  older, you'll get sense. If you want white hands and good grammar, how do  you expect to find a wife in the mountains?\"    Terry answered with unshaken, lordly calm. \"I haven't thought about the  details. They don't matter. But a man must have standards of criticism.\"    \"Standards your foot!\" cried Aunt Elizabeth. \"You insufferable young  prig. That very girl laughing down through the branches--I'll wager she  could set your head spinning in ten seconds if she thought it worth her  while to try.\"    \"Perhaps,\" smiled Terence. \"In the meantime she has freckles and a  vocabulary without growing pains.\"    \"All men are fools,\" declared Aunt Elizabeth; \"but boys are idiots, bless  'em! Terence, before you grow up you'll have sore toes from stumbling,  take my word for it! Do you know what a wise man would do?\"    \"Well?\"    \"Go out and start a terrific flirtation with Nelly.\"    \"For the sake of experience?\" sighed Terence.    \"Good heavens!\" groaned Aunt Elizabeth. \"Terry, you're impossible! Where  are you going now?\"    \"Out to see El Sangre.\"    He went whistling out of the door, and she followed him with confused  feelings of anger, pride, joy, and fear. She went to a side window and  saw him go fearlessly into the corral where the man-destroying El Sangre  was kept. And the big stallion, red fire in the sunshine, went straight  to him and nosed at a hip pocket. They had already struck up a perfect  understanding. Deeply she wondered at it.    She had never loved the mountains and their people and their ways. It had  been a battle to fight. She had fought the battle, won, and gained a  hollow victory. And watching Terry caress the great, beautiful horse, she  knew vaguely that his heart, at least, was in tune with the wilderness.    \"I wish to heaven, Terry,\" she murmured, \"that you could find a master as  El Sangre has done. You need teaching.\"    When she turned from the window, she found Vance watching her. He had a  habit of obscurely melting into a background and looking out at her  unexpectedly. All at once she knew that he had been there listening  during all of her talk with Terence. Not that the talk had been of a  peculiarly private nature, but it angered her. There was just a semblance  of eavesdropping about the presence of Vance. For she knew that Terence  unbosomed himself to her as he would do in the hearing of no other human  being. However, she mastered her anger and smiled at her brother. He had  taken all these recent changes which were so much to his disadvantage  with a good spirit that astonished and touched her.    \"Do you know what I'm going to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#7)"],[1,"wait on you?\" she asked,  feeling, now she had made this silent man talk, once more at her ease.    \"I am a borderman,\" replied Jonathan. There was a certain dignity or  sadness in his answer which reminded Helen of Colonel Zane's portrayal  of a borderman's life. It struck her keenly. Here was this young giant  standing erect and handsome before her, as rugged as one of the ash  trees of his beloved forest. Who could tell when his strong life might  be ended by an Indian's hatchet?    \"For you, then, is there no such thing as friendship?\" she asked.    \"On the border men are serious.\"    This recalled his sister's conversation regarding the attentions of  the young men, that they would follow her, fight for her, and give her  absolutely no peace until one of them had carried her to his cabin  a bride.    She could not carry on the usual conventional conversation with this  borderman, but remained silent for a time. She realized more keenly  than ever before how different he was from other men, and watched  closely as he stood gazing out over the river. Perhaps something she  had said caused him to think of the many pleasures and joys he missed.  But she could not be certain what was in his mind. She was not  accustomed to impassive faces and cold eyes with unlit fires in their  dark depths. More likely he was thinking of matters nearer to his  wild, free life; of his companion Wetzel somewhere out beyond those  frowning hills. Then she remembered that the colonel had told her of  his brother's love for nature in all its forms; how he watched the  shades of evening fall; lost himself in contemplation of the last  copper glow flushing the western sky, or became absorbed in the bright  stars. Possibly he had forgotten her presence. Darkness was rapidly  stealing down upon them. The evening, tranquil and gray, crept over  them with all its mystery. He was a part of it. She could not hope to  understand him; but saw clearly that his was no common personality.  She wanted to speak, to voice a sympathy strong within her; but she  did not know what to say to this borderman.    \"If what your sister tells me of the border is true, I may soon need a  friend,\" she said, after weighing well her words. She faced him  modestly yet bravely, and looked him straight in the eyes. Because he  did not reply she spoke again.    \"I mean such a friend as you or Wetzel.\"    \"You may count on both,\" he replied.    \"Thank you,\" she said softly, giving him her hand. \"I shall not  forget. One more thing. Will you break a borderman's custom, for  my sake?\"    \"How?\"    \"Come to see me when you are in the settlement?\"    Helen said this in a low voice with just a sob in her breath; but she  met his gaze fairly. Her big eyes were all aglow, alight with girlish  appeal, and yet proud with a woman's honest demand for fair exchange.  Promise was there, too, could he but read it, of wonderful  possibilities.    \"No,\" he answered gently.    Helen was not prepared for such a rebuff. She was interested in him,  and not ashamed to show it. She feared only that he might  misunderstand her; but to refuse her proffered friendship, that was  indeed unexpected. Rude she thought it was, while from brow to curving  throat her fair skin crimsoned. Then her face grew pale as the  moonlight. Hard on her resentment had surged the swell of some new  emotion strong and sweet. He refused her friendship because he did not  dare accept it; because his life was not his own; because he was a  borderman.    While they stood thus, Jonathan looking perplexed and troubled,  feeling he had hurt her, but knowing not what to say, and Helen with a  warm softness in her eyes, the stalwart figure of a man loomed out of  the gathering darkness.    \"Ah, Miss Helen! Good evening,\" he said.    \"Is it you, Mr. Brandt?\" asked Helen. \"Of course you know Mr. Zane.\"    Brandt acknowledged Jonathan's bow with an awkwardness which had  certainly been absent in his greeting to Helen. He started slightly  when she spoke the borderman's name.    A brief pause ensued.    \"Good night,\" said Jonathan, and left them.    He had noticed Brandt's gesture of surprise, slight though it was, and  was thinking about it as he walked away. Brandt may have been  astonished at finding a borderman talking to a girl, and certainly, as  far as Jonathan was concerned, the incident was without precedent.  But, on the other hand, Brandt may have had another reason, and  Jonathan tried to study out what it might be.    He gave but little thought to Helen. That she might like him  exceedingly well, did not come into his mind. He remembered his sister  Betty's gossip regarding Helen and her admirers, and particularly  Roger Brandt; but felt no great concern; he had no curiosity to know  more of her. He admired Helen because she was beautiful, yet the  feeling was much the same he might have experienced for a graceful  deer, a full-foliaged tree, or a dark mossy-stoned bend in a murmuring  brook. The girl's face and figure, perfect and alluring as they were,  had not awakened him from his indifference.    On arriving at his brother's home, he found the colonel and Betty  sitting on the porch.    \"Eb, who is this Brandt?\" he asked.    \"Roger Brandt? He's a French-Canadian; came here from Detroit a year  ago. Why do you ask?\"    \"I want to know more about him.\"    Colonel Zane reflected a moment, first as to this unusual request from  Jonathan, and secondly in regard to what little he really did know of  Roger Brandt.    \"Well, Jack, I can't tell you much; nothing of him before he showed up  here. He says he has been a pioneer, hunter, scout, soldier,  trader--everything. When he came to the fort we needed men. It was  just after Girty's siege, and all the cabins had been burned. Brandt  seemed honest, and was a good fellow. Besides, he had gold. He started  the river barges, which came from Fort Pitt. He has surely done the  settlement good service, and has prospered. I never talked a dozen  times to him, and even then, not for long. He appears to like the  young people, which is only natural. That's all I know; Betty might  tell you more, for he tried to be attentive to her.\"    \"Did he, Betty?\" Jonathan asked.    \"He followed me until I showed him I didn't care for company,\"  answered Betty.    \"What kind of a man is he?\"    \"Jack, I know nothing against him, although I never fancied him. He's  better educated than the majority of frontiersmen; he's good-natured  and agreeable, and the people like him.\"    \"Why don't you?\"    Betty looked surprised at his blunt question, and then said with a  laugh: \"I never tried to reason why; but since you have spoken I  believe my dislike was instinctive.\"    After Betty had retired to her room the brothers remained on the porch  smoking.    \"Betty's pretty keen, Jack. I never knew her to misjudge a man. Why  this sudden interest in Roger Brandt?\"    The borderman puffed his pipe in silence.    \"Say, Jack,\" Colonel Zane said suddenly, \"do you connect Brandt in any  way with this horse-stealing?\"    \"No more than some, an' less than others,\" replied Jonathan curtly.    Nothing more was said for a time. To the brothers this hour of early  dusk brought the same fullness of peace. From gray twilight to gloomy  dusk quiet reigned. The insects of night chirped and chorused with  low, incessant hum. From out the darkness came the peeping of frogs.    Suddenly the borderman straightened up, and, removing the pipe from  his mouth, turned his ear to the faint breeze, while at the same time  one hand closed on the colonel's knee with a warning clutch.    Colonel Zane knew what that clutch signified. Some faint noise, too  low for ordinary ears, had roused the borderman. The colonel listened,  but heard nothing save the familiar evening sounds.    \"Jack, what'd you hear?\" he whispered.    \"Somethin' back of the barn,\" replied Jonathan, slipping noiselessly  off the steps, lying at full length with his ear close to the ground.  \"Where's the dog?\" he asked.    \"Chief must have gone with Sam. The old nigger sometimes goes at this  hour to see his daughter.\"    Jonathan lay on the grass several moments; then suddenly he arose much  as a bent sapling springs to place.    \"I hear footsteps. Get the rifles,\" he said in a fierce whisper.    \"Damn! There is some one in the barn.\"    \"No; they're outside. Hurry, but softly.\"    Colonel Zane had but just risen to his feet, when Mrs. Zane came to  the door and called him by name.    Instantly from somewhere in the darkness overhanging the road, came a  low, warning whistle.    \"A signal!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane.    \"Quick, Eb! Look toward Metzar's light. One, two, three,  shadows--Injuns!\"    \"By the Lord Harry! Now they're gone; but I couldn't mistake those  round heads and bristling feathers.\"    \"Shawnees!\" said the borderman, and his teeth shut hard like steel on  flint.    \"Jack, they were after the horses, and some one was on the lookout! By  God! right under our noses!\"    \"Hurry,\" cried Jonathan, pulling his brother off the porch.    Colonel Zane followed the borderman out of the yard, into the road,  and across the grassy square.    \"We might find the one who gave the signal,\" said the colonel. \"He was  near at hand, and couldn't have passed the house.\"    Colonel Zane was correct, for whoever had whistled would be forced to  take one of two ways of escape; either down the straight road ahead,  or over the high stockade fence of the fort.    \"There he goes,\" whispered Jonathan.    \"Where? I can't see a blamed thing.\"    \"Go across the square, run around the fort, an' head him off on the  road. Don't try to stop him for he'll have weapons, just find out  who he is.\"    \"I see him now,\" replied Colonel Zane, as he hurried off into the  darkness.    During a few moments Jonathan kept in view the shadow he had seen  first come out of the gloom by the stockade, and thence pass swiftly  down the road. He followed swiftly, silently. Presently "]]]
