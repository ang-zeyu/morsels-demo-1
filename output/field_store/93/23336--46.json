And ever as Sir Ector rode he made diligent inquiry and he found that those  two knights had ridden before him, so he said to himself: \"By and by I  shall overtake them--if not to-day, at least by night, or by to-morrow  day.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Ector seeks adventure] But after a while he came to a  cross-roads, and there he took a way that Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had  not taken; so that, after he had gone a distance, he found that he had  missed them by taking that road. Nevertheless, he went on until about the  prime of the day, what time he met a forester, to whom he said: \"Sirrah,  saw you two knights ride this way--one knight clad in white armor with a  white shield upon which was depicted the figure of a lady, and the other  knight clad in red armor with the figure of a red gryphon upon his shield?\"  \"Nay,\" said the forester, \"I saw not such folk.\" Then said Sir Ector, \"Is  there any adventure to be found hereabouts?\" Upon this the forester fell to  laughing in great measure. \"Yea,\" he said, \"there is an adventure to be  found hard by and it is one that many have undertaken and not one yet hath  ever fulfilled.\" Then Sir Ector said, \"Tell me what that adventure is and I  will undertake it.\"    \"Sir,\" said the forester, \"if you will follow along yonder road for a  distance you will find a very large, strong castle surrounded by a broad  moat. In front of that castle is a stream of water with a fair, shallow  ford, where the roadway crosses the water. Upon this side of that ford  there groweth a thorn-tree, very large and sturdy, and upon it hangs a  basin of brass. Strike upon that basin with the butt of your spear, and you  shall presently meet with that adventure concerning which I have just now  spoken.\" \"Fellow,\" said Sir Ector, \"grammercy for your news.\" And,  therewith, straightway he rode off in search of that adventure.    He rode a great distance at a very fast gait and by and by he came to the  top of a hill and therewith he saw before him the mouth of a fair valley.  Across from where he stood was another hill not very large or high, but  exceedingly steep and rocky. Upon this farther hill was builded a tall,  noble castle of gray stone with many towers and spires and tall chimneys  and with several score of windows, all shining bright in the clear weather.  A fair river ran down into the mouth of that valley and it was as bright  and as smooth as silver, and on each side of it were smooth level  meadow-lands--very green--and here and there shady groves of trees and  plantations of fruit-trees. And Sir Ector perceived that the road upon  which he travelled crossed the aforesaid river by a shallow ford, and he  wist that this must be the ford whereof the forester had spoken. So he rode  down unto that ford, and when he had come nigh he perceived the thorn-tree  of which the forester had told him, and he saw that a great basin of brass  hung to the thorn-tree, just as the forester had said.    [Sidenote: Sir Ector smites upon the brazen basin] Then Sir Ector rode to  that thorn-tree and he smote upon that basin of brass with the butt of his  spear, so that the basin rang with a noise like thunder; and he smote it  again and again, several times over. But though he was aware of a great  commotion within that fair castle, yet no adventure befell him, although he  smote the brazen basin several times.    Now, his horse being athirst, Sir Ector drove him into the ford that he  might drink, and whilst he was there he was suddenly aware where, on the  other side of the stream, was a singular party coming along the roadway.  For first of all there rode a knight entirely clad in black, riding upon a  black horse, and all the harness and furniture of that horse entirely of  black. Behind him, that knight led four horses as though they were  pack-horses, and across each one of those four horses was a knight in full  armor, bound fast to the saddle like to a sack of grain, whereat Sir Ector  was very greatly astonished.    As soon as that sable knight approached the castle, several came running  forth and relieved him of those horses he led and took them into the  castle, and as soon as he had been thus relieved the sable knight rode very  violently up to where Sir Ector was. As soon as he had come to the water's  edge he cried out: \"Sir Knight, come forth from out of that water and do me  battle.\"    \"Very well,\" said Sir Ector, \"I will do so, though it will, I think, be to  thy very great discomfort.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Ector essays battle with the sable knight] With that he  came quickly out from the ford, the water whereof was all broken and  churned into foam at his passing, and straightway he cast aside his spear  and drew his sword and, driving against that sable knight, he smote him  such a buffet that his horse turned twice about.    \"Ha,\" said the black knight, \"that is the best blow that ever I had struck  me in all of my life.\" Therewith he rushed upon Sir Ector, and without  using a weapon of any sort he catched him about the body, underneath the  arms, and dragged him clean out of his saddle, and flung him across the  horn of his own saddle. Thereupon, having accomplished this marvellous  feat, and with Sir Ector still across his saddle-bow, he rode up unto his  castle, nor stopped until he had reached the court-yard of the keep. There  he set Sir Ector down upon the stone pavement. Then he said: \"Messire, thou  hast done to me this day what no other knight hath ever done to me before,  wherefore, if thou wilt promise to be my man from henceforth, I will let  thee go free and give thee great rewards for thy services as well.\"    But Sir Ector was filled very full of shame, wherefore he cried out  fiercely, \"Rather would I lie within a prison all my life than serve so  catiff a knight as thou, who darest to treat other knights as thou hast  just now treated me.\"    \"Well,\" said the black knight very grimly, \"thou shalt have thy choice.\"  Therewith he gave certain orders, whereupon a great many fierce fellows set  upon Sir Ector and stripped him of all his armor, and immediately haled him  off, half-naked, to that dungeon aforementioned.    [Sidenote: The sable knight makes prisoner of Sir Ector] There he found  many knights of King Arthur's court, and several of the Round Table, all of  whom he knew, and when they beheld Sir Ector flung in unto them in that  fashion they lifted up their voices in great lamentation that he should  have been added to their number, instead of freeing them from their  dolorous and pitiable case. \"Alas,\" said they, \"there is no knight alive  may free us from this dungeon, unless it be Sir Launcelot. For this Sir  Turquine is, certes, the greatest knight in all the world, unless it be Sir  Launcelot.\"    [Illustration: Queen Morgana appears unto Sir Launcelot]          Chapter Third      _How Sir Launcelot was Found in a Sleep by Queen Morgana le Fay and Three  Other Queens who were with Her, and How He was Taken to a Castle of Queen  Morgana's and of What Befell Him There._    [Sidenote: Four Queens and their courts pass by where Sir Launcelot lies  sleeping] So Sir Launcelot lay in deep slumber under that apple-tree, and  knew neither that Sir Lionel had left him nor what ill-fortune had befallen  that good knight. Whilst he lay there sleeping in that wise there came by,  along the road, and at a little distance from him, a very fair procession  of lordly people, making a noble parade upon the highway. The chiefest of  this company were four ladies, who were four queens. With them rode four  knights, and, because the day was warm, the four knights bore a canopy of  green silk by the four corners upon the points of their lances in such wise  as to shelter those queens from the strong heat of the sun. And those four  knights rode all armed cap-a-pie on four noble war-horses, and the four  queens, bedight in great estate, rode on four white mules richly  caparisoned with furniture of divers colors embroidered with gold. After  these lordly folk there followed a very excellent court of esquires and  demoiselles to the number of a score or more; some riding upon horses and  some upon mules that ambled very easily.    Now all these folk of greater or lesser degree were entirely unaware that  Sir Launcelot lay sleeping so nigh to them as they rode by chattering very  gayly together in the spring-time weather, taking great pleasure in the  warm air, and in growing things, and the green fields, and the bright sky;  and they would have had no knowledge that the knight was there, had not Sir  Launcelot's horse neighed very lustily. Thereupon, they were aware of the  horse, and then they were aware of Sir Launcelot where he lay asleep under  the apple-tree, with his head lying upon his helmet.    Now foremost of all those queens was Queen Morgana le Fay (who was King  Arthur's sister, and a potent, wicked enchantress, of whom much hath been  told in the Book of King Arthur), and besides Queen Morgana there was the  Queen of North Wales, and the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Outer  Isles.    Now when this party of queens, knights, esquires, and ladies heard the  war-horse neigh, and when they beheld Sir Launcelot where he lay, they  drew rein and marvelled very greatly to see a knight sleeping so soundly at  that place, maugre all the noise and tumult of their passing. So Queen  Morgana called to her one of the esquires who followed after them, and she  said to him: \"Go softly and see if thou knowest who is yonder knight; but  do not wake him.\"    [Sidenote: An esquire knoweth Sir Launcelot] So the esquire did as she  commanded; he went unto that apple-tree and he looked into Sir Launcelot's  face, and by hap he knew who it was because he had been to Camelot  erstwhiles and he had seen Sir Launcelot at that place. So he hastened back  to Queen Morgana and he said to her: \"Lady, I believe "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10751"],[0,"Oregon, Washington and Alaska; Sights and Scenes for the Tourist (#8)"],[1,"by  seventy miles in extent, embracing beautiful Coeur d'Alene Lake and the  three rivers, St. Joseph, St. Marys, and Coeur d'Alene, which empty  into it. There about 250 Indians on this reservation, and they enjoy  the proud distinction of being the only tribe who refuse Government  aid. They have been offered the usual rations, but preferred to remain  independent. They live in houses, farm quite extensively, and use all  kinds of improved farm machinery; many of them are quite wealthy. The  lake is one of the prettiest sheets of water on the continent; its  waters are full of salmon, and in the heavy pine woods are many  varieties of game, from quail to grizzly bear and elk. The town of  Rockford will in the near future assume importance as a tourist point,  both from its own healthy and picturesque location, and its nearness to  Coeur d'Alene Lake. A Government Commission is now at work on a  settlement with the Indians, whereby the whole or a part of this noble  domain will be thrown open to the public. The peculiar attractions of  Coeur d'Alene must in a short time render it a much sought for resort.    SPOKANE FALLS    Is one of those miracles possible only in the alert, aggressive West.  When Mr. Hayes was inaugurated it was a blank wilderness. Not a single  civilized being lived within a hundred miles of it. One day in 1878 a  white man came along in a \"bull team,\" saw the wild rapids and the mighty  falls of the Spokane River, reflected on the history of St. Paul and  Minneapolis with their little Falls of St. Anthony, looked at the tide of  immigration just turning toward the farther Northwest, and concluded he  would sit right down where he was and wait for a city to grow around him.  This far-sighted pioneer is still living within earshot of those rumbling  falls, and they make a cheerful music for him. The city is there with  him, 22,000 people, and he can draw a check to-day good for $1,000,000.  For several years his eyes fell on nothing but gravel-beds and foamy  waters. Now, as he looks around, he sees mills and factories, railroad  lines to the north, south, east, and west, churches, theatres,  school-houses, costly dwellings and stores, paved streets, and all that  makes living easy and comfortable. The greater part of this has come  within his vision since 1883. But even then there was quite a village.  After this pioneer had spent a lonely year or two on his homestead, two  other men came along. They were friends, who, upon an outing, had chanced  to meet. They were captivated by the waterfall, and by what the pioneer  told them of the fine fanning lands in the adjacent country, and they  offered each to take a third of his holding. Then they began to  advertise, and to place adventurous farmers on homestead claims. They  were wise in their day and generation, and they worked harder to fill the  country with grain-producers than to sell real estate around the falls.  They soon had their reward. The merchants were quickly provided with  store-houses, rental values were kept low, every inducement was offered  that could possibly stimulate building activity, and in three years the  farming country was made to perceive that Spokane was its natural point  of entry and of shipment. The turbulent waters of the Spokane River, a  clear and beautiful mountain stream, were caught above the falls, and  directed wherever the factories and mills that had been established above  them required their services. Four large flouring-mills quickly took  advantage of the rich opportunity growing out of this unique situation.  From two enormous agricultural areas they are enabled to draw their  supplies of grain, flour, therefore, being manufactured for the farmers  more cheaply at Spokane: than anywhere else. This circumstance alone  exercised a large influence in giving the new town a hold upon the  country districts. These constitute more than a region--they are really a  grand division of the State, and form what is known as the Great Plain of  the Columbia River.    THE COEUR D'ALENE MINES    Have reached a high and profitable state of development. These mines  extend over a comparatively limited area. They are close together, and  their ores, producing gold, silver, and lead, are all similar. Their  output for the last three years has been quite remarkable, and has placed  the Coeur d'Alene district among the foremost lead-producing regions in  the country. Gold, associated with iron, and treated by the free-milling  process, is largely found in the northern part of the district, but the  greatest amount of tonnage is derived from the southern country, where  the Galena silver mines, a dozen or more in number, have been discovered.  That minerals in large quantity existed in this country has been known for  years. But the want of railroad facilities for a long while prevented any  serious effort to get at them. The matter of transportation is now laid  at rest, and within the last three years $1,000,000 has been spent in  development. The returns have already more than justified the investment.    Tributary to Spokane, and reached by the various railroads now in  operation, are five other mining districts, at Colville, Okanagan,  Kootenai, Metaline, and Pend d'Oreille. They are in various stages of  development, but their wealth and availability have been clearly  ascertained. Spokane's population, in a degree greater than that of most  all these new cities, consists of young men and young women from the New  England and Middle States. They have enjoyed a remarkable and wholly  uninterrupted period of prosperity. Some of them have grown quickly and  immensely rich from real estate operations, but the great majority have  yet to realize on their investments because of the large sacrifices they  have made in building up the city. They are to-day in an admirable  position. As they have made money they have spent it; spent it in street  railroads, in the laying out of drives, in the building of comfortable  houses, in the establishment of electrical plants, and in a large number  of local improvements, every one of which has borne its part in making  the city attractive.    WONDERFUL VITALITY.    It has been well said of Spokane Falls, that \"it was another  fire-devastated city that did not seem to know it was hurt.\"    If Washington can stand the loss of millions of dollars in its four great  fires of the year, at Cheney, Ellensburg, Seattle, and Spokane, it is the  strongest evidence that its recuperative powers have solid backing. It  does seem to stand the loss, and actually thrive under it.    The great fire at Spokane Falls on the 4th of August, 1889, burned most  of the business portion of the city. Four hundred and fifty houses of  brick, stone, and wood were destroyed, entailing a loss, according to the  computation of the local agent of R.G. Dun & Co., of about $4,500,000.    The insurance in the burned district amounted to $2,600,000.    No people were ever in better condition to meet disaster, and none ever  met it with braver hearts or with quicker and more resolute determination  to survive the blow.    The city was in the midst of a period of marvelous prosperity. Its  population was increasing rapidly, many fine buildings were in process of  construction, its trade was extending over a vast region of country which  was being penetrated by new railroads centering within its limits, and  there were flowing to it the rich fruits of half a dozen prosperous  mining districts.    [Illustration: ONEONTA GORGE, COLUMBIA RIVER, ORE. On the Union Pacific  Ry.]    Its working people were all employed at good wages, and money was  abundant with all classes.    Hardly had the sun of the day following the fire risen upon the scene of  smoking desolation, when preparations began for rebuilding. It was felt  at once that the city would be rebuilt more substantially and more  handsomely than before.    The rebuilding of Spokane commenced on a very extensive scale; the city  will be entirely restored within twelve months, and far more attractively  than ever before. The class of buildings erected are of a very superior  character. The new Opera House has been modeled after the Broadway  Theatre, New York; the new Hotel Spokane, a structure creditable not only  to the city, but to the entire Pacific Northwest; five National Bank  buildings, at a cost of $100,000 each; upon the burned district have  arisen buildings solid in substance, and beautiful architecturally,  varying from five to seven stories in height, and costing all the way  from $60,000 to $300,000. This sturdy young giant of the North arises  from her ashes stronger, more attractive, more substantial, than before.  And there is abundant reason for solid faith in the future of Spokane  Falls.    It is the metropolis of a region 200,000 square miles in extent,  including 50,000 square miles of Washington, or all that portion east of  the Cascade Mountains, more than half of Idaho, the northern and eastern  portions of Oregon, a large part of Montana, and as much of British  Columbia as would make a State as large as New York.    It is the distributing point for the Coeur d'Alene, the Colville, the  Kootenai, and the Okanagan mining districts, all of which are in a  prosperous condition, and all of which are yielding rich and growing  tributes of trade.    It has adjacent to it the finest wheat-growing country in the world,  producing from 30 to 60 bushels per acre.    It has adjacent to it a country equally rich in the production of fruits  and vegetables.    It has adjacent to it the finest meadow lands between the Cascade and  Rocky Mountains.    It has adjacent to it extensive grazing lands, on which are hundreds of  thousands of cattle, sheep, and horses.    It has, adjacent to it, on Lakes Pend d'Oreille and Coeur d'Alene,  inexhaustible quantities of white pine, yellow pine, cedar and tamarack,  the manufacturing of which into lumber is"]]]
