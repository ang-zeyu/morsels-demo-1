Yet I am constrained to say  that hardly had the door closed on Miggles than we crowded together,  whispering, snickering, smiling, and exchanging suspicions, surmises,  and a thousand speculations in regard to our pretty hostess and her  singular companion. I fear that we even hustled that imbecile paralytic,  who sat like a voiceless Memnon in our midst, gazing with the serene  indifference of the Past in his passionate eyes upon our wordy counsels.  In the midst of an exciting discussion the door opened again, and  Miggles re-entered.    But not, apparently, the same Miggles who a few hours before had flashed  upon us. Her eyes were downcast, and as she hesitated for a moment on  the threshold, with a blanket on her arm, she seemed to have left behind  her the frank fearlessness which had charmed us a moment before. Coming  into the room, she drew a low stool beside the paralytic's chair, sat  down, drew the blanket over her shoulders, and saying, \"If it's all the  same to you, boys, as we're rather crowded, I'll stop here tonight,\"  took the invalid's withered hand in her own, and turned her eyes upon  the dying fire. An instinctive feeling that this was only premonitory  to more confidential relations, and perhaps some shame at our previous  curiosity, kept us silent. The rain still beat upon the roof, wandering  gusts of wind stirred the embers into momentary brightness, until, in a  lull of the elements, Miggles suddenly lifted up her head, and, throwing  her hair over her shoulder, turned her face upon the group and asked:    \"Is there any of you that knows me?\"    There was no reply.    \"Think again! I lived at Marysville in '53. Everybody knew me there, and  everybody had the right to know me. I kept the Polka saloon until I came  to live with Jim. That's six years ago. Perhaps I've changed some.\"    The absence of recognition may have disconcerted her. She turned her  head to the fire again, and it was some seconds before she again spoke,  and then more rapidly:    \"Well, you see I thought some of you must have known me. There's  no great harm done, anyway. What I was going to say was this: Jim  here\"--she took his hand in both of hers as she spoke--\"used to know me,  if you didn't, and spent a heap of money upon me. I reckon he spent all  he had. And one day--it's six years ago this winter--Jim came into my  back room, sat down on my sofy, like as you see him in that chair, and  never moved again without help. He was struck all of a heap, and never  seemed to know what ailed him. The doctors came and said as how it  was caused all along of his way of life--for Jim was mighty free and  wild-like--and that he would never get better, and couldn't last long  anyway. They advised me to send him to Frisco to the hospital, for he  was no good to anyone and would be a baby all his life. Perhaps it was  something in Jim's eye, perhaps it was that I never had a baby, but I  said 'No.' I was rich then, for I was popular with everybody--gentlemen  like yourself, sir, came to see me--and I sold out my business and  bought this yer place, because it was sort of out of the way of travel,  you see, and I brought my baby here.\"    With a woman's intuitive tact and poetry, she had, as she spoke, slowly  shifted her position so as to bring the mute figure of the ruined man  between her and her audience, hiding in the shadow behind it, as if  she offered it as a tacit apology for her actions. Silent and  expressionless, it yet spoke for her; helpless, crushed, and smitten  with the Divine thunderbolt, it still stretched an invisible arm around  her.    Hidden in the darkness, but still holding his hand, she went on:    \"It was a long time before I could get the hang of things about yer, for  I was used to company and excitement. I couldn't get any woman to help  me, and a man I dursen't trust; but what with the Indians hereabout,  who'd do odd jobs for me, and having everything sent from the North  Fork, Jim and I managed to worry through. The Doctor would run up from  Sacramento once in a while. He'd ask to see 'Miggles's baby,' as  he called Jim, and when he'd go away, he'd say, 'Miggles; you're a  trump--God bless you'; and it didn't seem so lonely after that. But  the last time he was here he said, as he opened the door to go, 'Do you  know, Miggles, your baby will grow up to be a man yet and an honor to  his mother; but not here, Miggles, not here!' And I thought he went away  sad--and--and--\" and here Miggles's voice and head were somehow both  lost completely in the shadow.    \"The folks about here are very kind,\" said Miggles, after a pause,  coming a little into the light again. \"The men from the fork used to  hang around here, until they found they wasn't wanted, and the women are  kind--and don't call. I was pretty lonely until I picked up Joaquin in  the woods yonder one day, when he wasn't so high, and taught him to beg  for his dinner; and then thar's Polly--that's the magpie--she knows no  end of tricks, and makes it quite sociable of evenings with her talk,  and so I don't feel like as I was the only living being about the ranch.  And Jim here,\" said Miggles, with her old laugh again, and coming out  quite into the firelight, \"Jim--why, boys, you would admire to see how  much he knows for a man like him. Sometimes I bring him flowers, and he  looks at 'em just as natural as if he knew 'em; and times, when we're  sitting alone, I read him those things on the wall. Why, Lord!\" said  Miggles, with her frank laugh, \"I've read him that whole side of the  house this winter. There never was such a man for reading as Jim.\"    \"Why,\" asked the Judge, \"do you not marry this man to whom you have  devoted your youthful life?\"    \"Well, you see,\" said Miggles, \"it would be playing it rather low down  on Jim, to take advantage of his being so helpless. And then, too, if we  were man and wife, now, we'd both know that I was bound to do what I do  now of my own accord.\"    \"But you are young yet and attractive--\"    \"It's getting late,\" said Miggles, gravely, \"and you'd better all turn  in. Good night, boys\"; and, throwing the blanket over her head, Miggles  laid herself down beside Jim's chair, her head pillowed on the low stool  that held his feet, and spoke no more. The fire slowly faded from the  hearth; we each sought our blankets in silence; and presently there was  no sound in the long room but the pattering of the rain upon the roof  and the heavy breathing of the sleepers.    It was nearly morning when I awoke from a troubled dream. The storm had  passed, the stars were shining, and through the shutterless window the  full moon, lifting itself over the solemn pines without, looked into  the room. It touched the lonely figure in the chair with an infinite  compassion, and seemed to baptize with a shining flood the lowly head of  the woman whose hair, as in the sweet old story, bathed the feet of him  she loved. It even lent a kindly poetry to the rugged outline of Yuba  Bill, half-reclining on his elbow between them and his passengers, with  savagely patient eyes keeping watch and ward. And then I fell asleep  and only woke at broad day, with Yuba Bill standing over me, and \"All  aboard\" ringing in my ears.    Coffee was waiting for us on the table, but Miggles was gone. We  wandered about the house and lingered long after the horses were  harnessed, but she did not return. It was evident that she wished to  avoid a formal leave-taking, and had so left us to depart as we had  come. After we had helped the ladies into the coach, we returned to  the house and solemnly shook hands with the paralytic Jim, as solemnly  settling him back into position after each handshake. Then we looked for  the last time around the long low room, at the stool where Miggles had  sat, and slowly took our seats in the waiting coach. The whip cracked,  and we were off!    But as we reached the highroad, Bill's dexterous hand laid the six  horses back on their haunches, and the stage stopped with a jerk. For  there, on a little eminence beside the road, stood Miggles, her hair  flying, her eyes sparkling, her white handkerchief waving, and her white  teeth flashing a last \"good-by.\" We waved our hats in return. And then  Yuba Bill, as if fearful of further fascination, madly lashed his horses  forward, and we sank back in our seats. We exchanged not a word until we  reached the North Fork, and the stage drew up at the Independence House.  Then, the Judge leading, we walked into the barroom and took our places  gravely at the bar.    \"Are your glasses charged, gentlemen?\" said the Judge, solemnly taking  off his white hat.    They were.    \"Well, then, here's to MIGGLES. GOD BLESS HER!\"    Perhaps He had. Who knows?          TENNESSEE'S PARTNER      I do not think that we ever knew his real name. Our ignorance of it  certainly never gave us any social inconvenience, for at Sandy Bar in  1854 most men were christened anew. Sometimes these appellatives were  derived from some distinctiveness of dress, as in the case of \"Dungaree  Jack\"; or from some peculiarity of habit, as shown in \"Saleratus Bill,\"  so called from an undue proportion of that chemical in his daily bread;  or for some unlucky slip, as exhibited in \"The Iron Pirate,\" a mild,  inoffensive man, who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate  mispronunciation of the term \"iron pyrites.\" Perhaps this may have been  the beginning of a rude heraldry; but I am constrained to think that  it was because a man's real name in that day rested solely upon his own  unsupported statement. \"Call yourself Clifford, do you?\" said Boston,  addressing a timid newcomer with infinite scorn; \"hell is full of such  Cliffords!\" He then introduced the unfortunate man, whose name happened  to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#8)"],[1," from the south-eastward did not permit me to go up this arm,  and the extensive flats made it impossible to land upon the south side of  the bay; and finding that nothing more could be done at this time, I  returned to the ship.    The numerous shoals in Keppel Bay rendering the services of the Lady  Nelson in a great measure useless to the examination, I directed  lieutenant Murray to run out to the hummocky island lying to the  north-east from Cape Keppel, and endeavour to take us some turtle; for  there were no signs of inhabitants upon it, and turtle seemed to be  plentiful in this neighbourhood. He was also to ascend the hills, and  take bearings of any island or other object visible in the offing; and  after making such remarks as circumstances might allow, to return not  later than the third evening.    THURSDAY 12 AUGUST 1802    Next afternoon, I went, accompanied by the naturalist, to examine the  eastern arm of the bay, which is divided into two branches. Pursuing the  easternmost and largest, with soundings from 6 to 3 fathoms, we came to  several mangrove islands, about four miles up, where the stream changed  its direction from S. S. E. to E. S. E., and the deepest water was 2  fathoms. A little further on we landed for the night, cutting a path  through the mangroves to a higher part of the northern shore; but the  swarms of musketoes and sand flies made sleeping impossible to all except  one of the boat's crew, who was so enviably constituted, that these  insects either did not attack him, or could not penetrate his skin. It  was high water here at nine o'clock; and the tide afterwards fell between  ten and twelve feet.    FRIDAY 13 AUGUST 1802    In the morning, I set Broad Mount in Keppel Bay at N. 61 deg. 20' W. and  Mount Larcom S. 8 deg. 20' E; and we then steered onward in six to eight feet  water, amongst various little islands of mud and mangroves; the whole  width of the stream being still more than half a mile, nearly the same as  at the entrance. Three miles above the sleeping place the water began to  increase in breadth, and was 2 fathoms deep; and advancing further, it  took a direction more southward, and to our very agreeable surprise,  brought us to the head of Port Curtis; forming thus a channel of  communication from Keppel Bay, and cutting off Cape Capricorn with a  piece of land twenty-five miles in length, from the continent.    I landed on the eastern shore, nearly opposite to the reddish cliffs  which had been my uppermost station from Port Curtis, and set    Broad Mount in Keppel Bay at  N. 60 deg. 45' W.  Mount Larcom,                 S. 16  15  W.    Having found one communication, we rowed up the western branch near the  reddish cliffs, hoping to get back to Keppel Bay by a second new passage;  but after going two miles, with a diminishing depth from 4 fathoms to  three feet, we were stopped by mangroves, and obliged to return to the  main stream.    The tide was half ebbed when we came to the shallowest part of the  communicating channel; and it was with much difficulty that the boat  could be got over. A space here of about two miles in length, appears to  be dry, or very nearly so, at low water; but it is possible that some  small channel may exist amongst the mangroves, of sufficient depth for a  boat to pass at all times of tide.    We reached the entrance of the eastern arm from Keppel Bay, with the last  of the ebb; and took the flood to go up the southern branch. The depth of  water was generally 3 fathoms, on the eastern side, and the width nearly  half a mile. This continued three miles up, when a division took place;  in the smallest, which ran southward, we got one mile, and up the other,  leading south-westward, two miles; when both were found to terminate in  shallows amongst the mangroves. It was then dusk; and there being no  possibility of landing, the boat was made fast to a mangrove bush till  high water, and with the returning ebb, we got on board the ship at  eleven o'clock.    The Lady Nelson had returned from the hummocky island, without taking any  turtle. No good anchorage was found, nor was there either wood or water  upon the island, worth the attention of a ship. Mr. Murray ascended the  highest of the hummocks with a compass, but did not see any lands in the  offing further out than the Keppel Isles.    SATURDAY 14 AUGUST 1802    I left the ship again in the morning, and went up the southern arm to a  little hill on its western shore; hoping to gain from thence a better  knowledge of the various streams which intersect the low land on the  south side of the bay. This arm is one mile in width, and the depth in it  from 3 to 6 fathoms; the shores are flat, as in other parts, and covered  with mangroves; but at high water a landing was effected under the _South  Hill_, without much trouble. The sides of this little eminence are steep,  and were so thickly covered with trees and shrubs, bound together and  intertwisted with strong vines, that our attempts to reach the top were  fruitless. It would perhaps have been easier to climb up the trees, and  scramble from one to another upon the vines, than to have penetrated  through the intricate net work in the darkness underneath.    Disappointed in my principal object, and unable to do any thing in the  boat, which could not then approach the shore within two hundred yards, I  sought to walk upwards, and ascertain the communication between the south  and south-west arms; but after much fatigue amongst the mangroves and  muddy swamps, very little more information could be gained. The small  fish which leaps on land upon two strong breast fins, and was first seen  by captain Cook on the shores of Thirsty Sound, was very common in the  swamps round the South Hill. There were also numbers of a small kind of  red crab, having one of its claws uncommonly large, being, indeed, nearly  as big as the body; and this it keeps erected and open, so long as there  is any expectation of disturbance. It was curious to see a file of these  pugnacious little animals raise their claws at our approach, and open  their pincers ready for an attack; and afterwards, finding there was no  molestation, shoulder their arms and march on.    At nine in the evening, the tide brought the boat under the hill, and  allowed us to return to the ship. All the examination of Keppel Bay which  our time could allow, was now done; but a day being required for laying  down the plan of the different arms, I offered a boat on Sunday [15  AUGUST 1802] morning to the botanists, to visit the South Hill, which  afforded a variety of plants; but they found little that had not before  fallen under their observation. A part of the ship's company was allowed  to go on shore abreast of the ship, for no Indians had hitherto been seen  there; but towards the evening, about twenty were observed in company  with a party of the sailors. They had been met with near Cape Keppel, and  at first menaced our people with their spears; but finding them inclined  to be friendly, laid aside their arms, and accompanied the sailors to the  ship in a good-natured manner. A master's mate and a seaman were,  however, missing, and nothing was heard of them all night.    MONDAY 16 AUGUST 1802    At daylight, two guns were fired and an officer was sent up the small  inlet under Sea Hill; whilst I took a boat round to Cape Keppel, in the  double view of searching for the absentees and obtaining a set of  bearings from the top of the cape. This station afforded me a better view  of the Keppel Isles than any former one; and to the northward of them  were two high peaks on the main land, nearly as far distant as Cape  Manifold.    Amongst the number of bearings taken, those most essential to the  connection of the survey were as under.    Cape Capricorn, outer hummock,              S. 79 deg. 30' E.  Mount Larcom,                               S.  6  10  E.  The ship at anchor,                         S. 59  50  W.  Highest peak near Cape Manifold,            N. 25  10  W.  Keppel Isles, outermost, called first lump, N.  0  45  E.  Hummocky Island,                 N. 54 deg. 35' to 61  40  E.    On my return to the ship, the master's mate and seaman were on board. The  officer had very incautiously strayed away from his party, after natives  had been seen; and at sunset, when he should have been at the beach, he  and the man he had taken with him were entangled in a muddy swamp amongst  mangroves, several miles distant; in which uncomfortable situation, and  persecuted by clouds of musketoes, they passed the night. Next morning  they got out of the swamp; but fell in with about twenty-five Indians,  who surrounded and took them to a fire place. A couple of ducks were  broiled; and after the wanderers had satisfied their hunger, and  undergone a personal examination, they were conducted back to the ship in  safety. Some of the gentlemen went to meet the natives with presents, and  an interview took place, highly satisfactory to both parties; the Indians  then returned to the woods, and our people were brought on board.    TUESDAY 17 AUGUST 1802    The anchor was weighed at daylight of the 17th, but the wind and tide  being unfavourable, it took the whole day to get into the offing; at dusk  we came to, in 9 fathoms, mud and sand, having the centre of the hummocky  island bearing S. 72 deg. E. two leagues. A sketch of the island and of Cape  Keppel was taken by Mr. Westall (Atlas, Plate XVIII. View 5.) whilst  beating out of the bay.    Keppel Bay was discovered and named by captain Cook, who sailed past it  in 1770. A ship going in will be much deceived by the colour of the  water; for the shores of the bay being soft and muddy, the water running  out by the deep channels with the latter part of the ebb, is thick;  whilst the more shallow parts, over which the tide does not then set, are  covered with sea water, which is clear. Not only are the shores for the  most part"]]]
