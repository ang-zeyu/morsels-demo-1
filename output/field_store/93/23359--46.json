[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#8)"],[1," modern  times.\"      IV    Michelangelo arrived in Rome at the end of June 1496. This we know  from the first of his extant letters, which is dated July 2, and  addressed to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. The superscription,  however, bears the name of Sandro Botticelli, showing that some  caution had still to be observed in corresponding with the Medici,  even with those who latterly assumed the name of Popolani. The young  Buonarroti writes in excellent spirits: \"I only write to inform you  that last Saturday we arrived safely, and went at once to visit the  Cardinal di San Giorgio; and I presented your letter to him. It  appeared to me that he was pleased to see me, and he expressed a wish  that I should go immediately to inspect his collection of statues. I  spent the whole day there, and for that reason was unable to deliver  all your letters. Afterwards, on Sunday, the Cardinal came into the  new house, and had me sent for. I went to him, and he asked what I  thought about the things which I had seen. I replied by stating my  opinion, and certainly I can say with sincerity that there are many  fine things in the collection. Then he asked me whether I had the  courage to make some beautiful work of art. I answered that I should  not be able to achieve anything so great, but that he should see what  I could do. We have bought a piece of marble for a life-size statue,  and on Monday I shall begin to work.\"    After describing his reception, Michelangelo proceeds to relate the  efforts he was making to regain his Sleeping Cupid from Messer  Baldassare: \"Afterwards, I gave your letter to Baldassare, and asked  him for the child, saying I was ready to refund his money. He answered  very roughly, swearing he would rather break it in a hundred pieces;  he had bought the child, and it was his property; he possessed  writings which proved that he had satisfied the person who sent it to  him, and was under no apprehension that he should have to give it up.  Then he complained bitterly of you, saying that you had spoken ill of  him. Certain of our Florentines sought to accommodate matters, but  failed in their attempt. Now I look to coming to terms through the  Cardinal; for this is the advice of Baldassare Balducci. What ensues I  will report to you.\" It is clear that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, being  convinced of the broker's sharp practice, was trying to recover the  Sleeping Cupid (the child) at the price originally paid for it, either  for himself or for Buonarroti. The Cardinal is mentioned as being the  most likely person to secure the desired result.    Whether Condivi is right in saying that S. Giorgio neglected to employ  Michelangelo may be doubted. We have seen from this letter to Lorenzo  that the Cardinal bought a piece of marble and ordered a life-size  statue. But nothing more is heard about the work. Professor Milanesi,  however, has pointed out that when the sculptor was thinking of  leaving Rome in 1497 he wrote to his father on the 1st of July as  follows: \"Most revered and beloved father, do not be surprised that I  am unable to return, for I have not yet settled my affairs with the  Cardinal, and I do not wish to leave until I am properly paid for my  labour; and with these great patrons one must go about quietly, since  they cannot be compelled. I hope, however, at any rate during the  course of next week, to have completed the transaction.\"    Michelangelo remained at Rome for more than two years after the date  of the letter just quoted. We may conjecture, then, that he settled  his accounts with the Cardinal, whatever these were, and we know that  he obtained other orders. In a second letter to his father, August 19,  1497, he writes thus: \"Piero de' Medici gave me a commission for a  statue, and I bought the marble. But I did not begin to work upon it,  because he failed to perform what he promised. Wherefore I am acting  on my own account, and am making a statue for my own pleasure. I  bought the marble for five ducats, and it turned out bad. So I threw  my money away. Now I have bought another at the same price, and the  work I am doing is for my amusement. You will therefore understand  that I too have large expenses and many troubles.\"    During the first year of his residence in Rome (between July 2, 1496,  and August 19, 1497) Michelangelo must have made some money, else he  could not have bought marble and have worked upon his own account.  Vasari asserts that he remained nearly twelve months in the household  of the Cardinal, and that he only executed a drawing of S. Francis  receiving the stigmata, which was coloured by a barber in S. Giorgio's  service, and placed in the Church of S. Pietro a Montorio. Benedetto  Varchi describes this picture as having been painted by Buonarroti's  own hand. We know nothing more for certain about it. How he earned his  money is therefore, unexplained, except upon the supposition that S.  Giorgio, unintelligent as he may have been in his patronage of art,  paid him for work performed. I may here add that the Piero de' Medici  who gave the commission mentioned in the last quotation was the exiled  head of the ruling family. Nothing had to be expected from such a man.  He came to Rome in order to be near the Cardinal Giovanni, and to  share this brother's better fortunes; but his days and nights were  spent in debauchery among the companions and accomplices of shameful  riot.    Michelangelo, in short, like most young artists, was struggling into  fame and recognition. Both came to him by the help of a Roman  gentleman and banker, Messer Jacopo Gallo. It so happened that an  intimate Florentine friend of Buonarroti, the Baldassare Balducci  mentioned at the end of his letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, was  employed in Gallo's house of business. It is probable, therefore, that  this man formed the link of connection between the sculptor and his  new patron. At all events, Messer Gallo purchased a Bacchus, which now  adorns the sculpture-gallery of the Bargello, and a Cupid, which may  possibly be the statue at South Kensington.    Condivi says that this gentleman, \"a man of fine intelligence,  employed him to execute in his own house a marble Bacchus, ten palms  in height, the form and aspect of which correspond in all parts to the  meaning of ancient authors. The face of the youth is jocund, the eyes  wandering and wanton, as is the wont with those who are too much  addicted to a taste for wine. In his right hand he holds a cup,  lifting it to drink, and gazing at it like one who takes delight in  that liquor, of which he was the first discoverer. For this reason,  too, the sculptor has wreathed his head with vine-tendrils. On his  left arm hangs a tiger-skin, the beast dedicated to Bacchus, as being  very partial to the grape. Here the artist chose rather to introduce  the skin than the animal itself, in order to hint that sensual  indulgence in the pleasure of the grape-juice leads at last to loss of  life. With the hand of this arm he holds a bunch of grapes, which a  little satyr, crouched below him, is eating on the sly with glad and  eager gestures. The child may seem to be seven years, the Bacchus  eighteen of age.\" This description is comparatively correct, except  that Condivi is obviously mistaken when he supposes that  Michelangelo's young Bacchus faithfully embodies the Greek spirit. The  Greeks never forgot, in all their representations of Dionysos, that he  was a mystic and enthusiastic deity. Joyous, voluptuous, androgynous,  he yet remains the god who brought strange gifts and orgiastic rites  to men. His followers, Silenus, Bacchantes, Fauns, exhibit, in their  self-abandonment to sensual joy, the operation of his genius. The  deity descends to join their revels from his clear Olympian ether, but  he is not troubled by the fumes of intoxication. Michelangelo has  altered this conception. Bacchus, with him, is a terrestrial young  man, upon the verge of toppling over into drunkenness. The value of  the work is its realism. The attitude could not be sustained in actual  life for a moment without either the goblet spilling its liquor or the  body reeling side-ways. Not only are the eyes wavering and wanton, but  the muscles of the mouth have relaxed into a tipsy smile; and, instead  of the tiger-skin being suspended from the left arm, it has slipped  down, and is only kept from falling by the loose grasp of the  trembling hand. Nothing, again, could be less godlike than the face of  Bacchus. It is the face of a not remarkably good-looking model, and  the head is too small both for the body and the heavy crown of leaves.  As a study of incipient intoxication, when the whole person is  disturbed by drink, but human dignity has not yet yielded to a bestial  impulse, this statue proves the energy of Michelangelo's imagination.  The physical beauty of his adolescent model in the limbs and body  redeems the grossness of the motive by the inalienable charm of health  and carnal comeliness. Finally, the technical merits of the work  cannot too strongly be insisted on. The modelling of the thorax, the  exquisite roundness and fleshiness of the thighs and arms and belly,  the smooth skin-surface expressed throughout in marble, will excite  admiration in all who are capable of appreciating this aspect of the  statuary's art. Michelangelo produced nothing more finished in  execution, if we except the Pieta at S. Peter's. His Bacchus alone is  sufficient to explode a theory favoured by some critics, that, left to  work unhindered, he would still have preferred a certain vagueness, a  certain want of polish in his marbles.    Nevertheless, the Bacchus leaves a disagreeable impression on the  mind--as disagreeable in its own way as that produced by the Christ of  the Minerva. That must be because it is wrong in spiritual  conception--brutally materialistic, where it ought to have been noble  or graceful.
