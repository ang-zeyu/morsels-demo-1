I don't  want too many to go down or we may startle Libbie.\"    Betty crept downstairs after Mrs. Littell, the soft, thick rugs making  their progress absolutely noiseless. Not a step in the well-built  staircase creaked.    They found the chain and bolt drawn from the heavy front door. Libbie had  evidently let herself out with no difficulty. From the wide hall window  Bob and Esther watched breathlessly.    \"Just go up to her quietly and take one of her hands,\" Mrs. Littell  whispered to Betty. \"I'll take the other, and, if I'm not mistaken, we  can lead her into the house.\"    Libbie stood motionless beside a rosebush as they approached her. Her  eyes were wide open, and her dark hair floated over her shoulders. In her  white nightdress, the moonlight full upon her, she looked very pretty and  yet so weird that Betty could not repress a shiver.    Mrs. Littell did not speak, but took one of the limp hands in hers, and  Betty took the other. Libbie made no resistance, and allowed them to  draw her toward the house. They crossed the threshold, led her upstairs,  past the quivering Esther and Bob huddled on the windowseat, and into the  bedroom she had so unceremoniously left.    Then Mrs. Littell lifted her in strong arms, put her gently down on the  bed, and Libbie rolled up like a little kitten, tucked one hand under her  cheek and continued to sleep.    \"Now go to bed, children, do,\" commanded Mrs. Littell. \"Bob, I'm so  thankful you saw that child--she might have wandered off or caught a  severe cold. As it is, I don't believe she has been out very long. What's  the matter, Esther?\"    \"Can I come and sleep with you?\" pleaded Esther. \"I'm afraid to sleep  with Libbie. She might do it again.\"    \"I don't think so--not to-night,\" said her mother, smiling. \"However,  chicken, come and sleep with me if you'll rest better.\"    Betty awoke and went in later that night to see if Libbie had vanished  again, but found her sleeping normally. In the morning the girl was much  surprised to find she had been wandering in the garden and betrayed  considerable interest in the details. Betty decided that it would be  better to omit Esther's belief that she had eloped, and Libbie was  allowed to remain in blissful ignorance of the action her youthful cousin  attributed to her.    The last day sped by all too soon, and what the Tucker twins persisted  in pessimistically designating the \"fateful Thursday\" was upon them.    \"I don't know why you sigh so frequently,\" dimpled Betty, who sat next to  Tommy Tucker at the breakfast table. \"I'm very anxious to go to school.  Don't you really like to go back?\"    \"It's like this,\" said Tommy, the \"dark Tucker twin,\" solemnly. \"From  four to ten p.m. (except on drill nights) I like it well enough, and from  ten, lights out, till six, reveille, I'm fairly contented. But from nine  to four, when we're cooped up in classrooms, I simply detest school!\"    Teddy, the \"light Tucker twin,\" nodded in confirmation.    \"I suppose we have to be educated,\" he admitted, with the air of one  making a generous concession to public opinion, \"but I don't see why they  find it necessary to prolong the agony. Any one who can read and write  can make a living.\"    \"Perhaps your father hopes you'll do a bit more than that,\" suggested Mr.  Littell slyly.    This effectually silenced the twins, for their wealthy father was a  splendid scientist who had made several explorations that had contributed  materially to the knowledge of the scientific world, and he had lost the  sight of one eye in a laboratory experiment undertaken to advance the  cause for which he labored.    The Littell car carried the twelve to the station soon after  breakfast, and though Shadyside and Salsette, unlike many of the large  northern schools, ran no \"special,\" the few passengers who were not  school bound found themselves decidedly in the minority on the \"9:36  local\" that morning.    \"Remember, Betty, you and Bob are to spend the holidays with us,\" said  Mrs. Littell, as she kissed her good-bye. \"If your uncle comes down from  Canada, he must come, too.\"    \"All aboard!\" shouted the conductor, who foresaw a lively trip. \"No'm,  you can't go through the gate--nobody can.\"    The crowd of fathers and mothers and younger brothers and sisters  pressed close to the iron grating as the train got under way. On the  back platform the Tucker twins raised their voices in a school yell that  would have horrified the dignified heads of the Academy had they been  there to hear it.          CHAPTER IX    ADJUSTER TOMMY      \"I'm Salsette born!\" trilled Tommy Tucker soulfully.    \"And Salsette bred!\" chimed in his brother    \"And when I die--\" caroled Tommy.    \"I'll be Salsette dead!\" they finished together.    Then, highly satisfied with this intelligible ditty, they burst into the  car where the others were waiting for them.    The boys had appropriated the seats at the forward end of the car, and  unfortunately their selection included a seat in which an elderly, or so  she seemed to them, woman sat. She fidgeted incessantly, folding and  unfolding her long traveling coat, opening and closing a fitted lunch  basket, and arranging and re-arranging several small unwieldy parcels and  heavy books that slid persistently to the floor with the jarring of the  train. When the conductor came through for tickets, she discovered that  she had mislaid hers and it was necessary to flutter the pages of every  book before the missing bit of pasteboard finally dropped from between  the leaves of the last one opened.    Bob, with instinctive courtesy, had offered to help her search, but she  had rebuffed him sharply.    \"I don't want any boy pawing over my belongings,\" she informed him  tartly.    Bob flushed a little, it was impossible not to help it, but he said  nothing. Meeting Betty's indignant eyes, he smiled good-humoredly.    \"Sweet pickles!\" ejaculated Tommy Tucker indignantly. \"Here, you Timothy,  hand me that suitcase at your feet--it belongs to the little dark girl.\"    Libbie, \"the little dark girl,\" smiled dreamily as Timothy passed her  suitcase to Tommy. She and Timothy Derby, ignoring the jeers of their  friends, were deep in two white and gold volumes of poetry. Timothy,  Libbie had discovered, had a leaning toward the romantic in fiction,  though he preferred his served in rhyme.    The wicked Tommy had a motive in asking for Libbie's suitcase. It was  much smaller and lighter than any of the others, and he swung it deftly  into the rack over the vinegary lady's unsuspecting head. With a  deftness, born it must be confessed of previous practice, he balanced  the case on the rim so that the first lurch of the train catapulted the  thing down squarely on the woman's hat, snapping a shiny, hard black  quill in two.    \"I must say!\" she sputtered, rising angrily. \"Who put that up there? If  anything goes in that rack, it will be some of my things. I paid for  this seat.\"    She set the suitcase out into the aisle with a decided bang, and lifted  up the wicker lunch basket. To the glee of the watching young people, as  she lifted it to the rack, two china cups, several teaspoons and a silver  cream jug sifted down. The cups broke on the floor and the other articles  rolled under the seats.    \"Get 'em, quick!\" cried the owner. \"My two best cups broken, and I  thought I had them packed so well! Pick up those teaspoons, some of  you--they're solid silver!\"    \"If you don't mind boys pawing them--\" began Teddy Tucker, but Betty  intervened.    \"Oh, don't!\" she protested softly. \"Don't be so mean. Pick them up,  please do.\"    So down on their hands and knees went the six lads, and if, in their  earnestness, they bumped into the elderly woman's hat box, and knocked  down her books, that really should not be held against them.    \"Now for mercy's sake, don't let me hear from you again,\" was her  speech of thanks to them when the teaspoons had been recovered and  restored to her.    She might have been severely left alone after this, if Sydney Cooke had  not discovered a remarkable peculiarity she possessed. Sydney was a great  lover of games, and he had brought his pocket checkerboard and men with  him. He persuaded Winifred Marion Brown to play a game with him, and the  rest of the party crowded around to watch.    \"I'll trouble you to let me pass,\" said the owner of the teaspoons, when  Sydney had just made his first play.    The group parted to let her through, closed in again, and opened again  for her when she came back. No one paid any attention to this until she  had made the request four times.    \"What ails that woman?\" demanded Sydney irritably.    Each time she had passed him she had brushed his elbow, scattering his  checkers about. Ordinarily sweet-tempered, Sydney was beginning to weary  of this performance.    \"What do you think?\" snickered Bobby Littell. \"She takes a white tablet  every five minutes. Honest! I've been watching her. She sits there with  her watch in her hand, and exactly five minutes apart--I've timed  her--she starts for the water cooler. She puts something on her tongue,  swallows a glass of water, and comes back.\"    \"Well, somebody carry her a gallon jug,\" muttered Sydney impatiently. \"I  can't get anywhere if she is going to parade up and down the aisle  incessantly.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said Tommy Tucker soothingly. \"I'll adjust this little  matter for you.\"    If Sydney had been less interested in his game, he might have felt  slightly apprehensive. The Tucker twins were famous for their  \"adjustments.\"    Tommy went down the aisle and slipped into the seat directly back of the  woman who did not approve of boys. She turned and regarded him hostilely,  but he gazed out at the flying landscape. The moment she turned around,  he ducked to the floor.    \"What do you suppose he is doing?\" whispered Bobby to Betty. \"Tommy can  think up tricks faster than any boy I ever knew.\"    Whatever Tommy was doing, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#8)"],[1," and communicated the tidings to the  \"boys\" around the stove.    \"A couple of dozen eggs, he says to me, and a few pounds of beef and  three or four quarts of milk and a bowl of flapjacks and a platter of  bacon,\" was the way the second version of the historic order for food  came to the idlers.    Half a dozen of the men risked the cold and the wind to steal around  to the side of the house and peer through the window at the huge,  bunched figure that sat on the floor. They found him with his chin  dropped upon the burly fist and a frown on his forehead, for Bull  was thinking.    He would have been glad to have found Pete Reeve in Johnstown and have  the matter over with. But, after all, it was beginning to occur to him  that it might not be wise to kill the man in the presence of other  people. They might attempt to correct him with the assistance of a  rope and a limb of a tree. Somewhere he must cut in ahead of this  Reeve and start out at him if possible. As for his ability to keep  pace with a horse he had no doubt that he could do it fairly well.  More than once he had gone out on foot, while Harry and Joe rode, and  he had pressed the little ponies, bearing their riders slowly up and  down the slopes, to keep pace with him. On the level, of course, it  was a different matter, but in broken country he more than kept up.    \"Have you got a grudge agin' Reeve?\" asked the host, as he brought in  the fried eggs.    \"Maybe,\" admitted Bull, and instantly he began to attack the food.    The proprietor watched with a growing awe. No chinook ever ate snow as  this hungry giant melted food to nothingness. He came back with the  first stack of flapjacks and bacon and more questions. \"But I'd think  that a gent like you'd be pretty careful about tangling with Pete  Reeve--him being so handy with a gun and you such a tolerable  big target.\"    \"I've figured that all out,\" said Bull calmly. \"But they's so much of  me to kill that I don't figure one bullet could do the work. Do you?\"    The eyes of the proprietor grew large. He swallowed, and before he  could answer Bull continued in the exposition of his theory. \"Before  he shoots the next shot, maybe I can get my hands on him.\"    \"You going to fight him bare hands agin' a gun?\"    \"You see,\" said Bull apologetically, \"I ain't much good with a gun,  but I feel sort of curious about what would happen if I got my grip  on a man.\"    And that was the foundation on which another section of the Bull  Hunter legend was built.          CHAPTER 6      The bed on which Bull Hunter reposed his bulk that night was not the  cot to which he was shown by his host. One glance at the spindling  wooden legs of the canvas-bottomed cot was enough for Bull, and having  wrapped himself in the covers he lay down on the floor and was  instantly asleep.    While it was still dark, he wakened out of a dream in which Pete Reeve  seemed to be riding far--far away on the rim of the world. Ten minutes  later Bull was on the trail out of Johnstown. There was only one trail  for a horseman south of Johnstown, and that trail followed the  windings of the valley. Bull planned to push across the ragged peaks  of the Little Cloudy Mountains and head off the fugitive at  Glenn Crossing.    Two days of stern labor went into the next burst. He followed the cold  stars by night and the easy landmarks by day, and for food he had the  stock of raisins he had bought at Johnstown. He came out of the  heights and dropped down into Glenn Crossing in the gloom of the  second evening. But raisins are meager support for such a bulk as that  of Bull Hunter. It was a gaunt-faced giant who looked in at the door  of the shop where the blacksmith was working late. The mechanic looked  up with a start at the deep voice of the stranger, but he managed to  stammer forth his tidings. Such a man as Pete Reeve had indeed been in  Glenn Crossing, but he had gone on at the very verge of day and night.    Bull Hunter set his teeth, for there was no longer a possibility of  cutting off Pete Reeve by crossing country. The immense labors of the  last three days had merely served to put him on the heels of the  horseman, and now he must follow straight down country and attempt to  match his long legs against the speed of a fine horse. He drew a deep  breath and plunged into the night out of Glenn Crossing, on the south  trail. At least he would make one short, stiff march before the  weariness overtook him.    That weariness clouded his brain ten miles out. He built a fire in a  cover of pines and slept beside it. Before dawn he was up and out  again. In the first gray of the daylight he reached a little store at  a crossroad, and here he paused for breakfast. A tousled girl, rubbing  the sleep out of her eyes, served him in the kitchen. The first  glimpse of the hollow cheeks and the unshaven face of Bull Hunter  quite awakened her. Bull could feel her watching him, as she glided  about the room. He sunk his head between his shoulders and glared down  at the table. No doubt she would begin to gibe at him before long.  Most women did. He prepared himself to meet with patience that  incredible sting and penetrating hurt of a woman's mockery.    But there was no mockery forthcoming. The sun was still not up when he  paid his bill and hastened to the door of the old building. Quick  footsteps followed him, a hand touched his shoulders, and he turned  and looked suspiciously down into the face of the girl. It was a  frightened face, he thought, and very pretty. At some interval between  the time when he first saw her and the present, she had found time to  rearrange her hair and make it smooth. Color was pulsing in  her cheeks.    \"Stranger,\" she said softly, \"what are you running away from?\"    The question slowly penetrated the mind of Bull; he was still  bewildered by the change in her--something electric, to be felt rather  than noted with the eye.    \"They ain't any reason for hurrying on,\" she urged. \"I--I can hide  you, easy. Nobody could find where I'll put you, and there you can  rest up. You must be tolerable tired.\"    There was no doubt about it. There was kindness as well as anxiety in  her voice. For the second time in his entire life, Bull decided that a  woman could be something more than an annoyance. She was placing a  value on him, just as Jessie, three days before, had placed a value on  him; and it disturbed Bull. For so many years, he had been mocked and  scorned by his uncle and cousins that deep in his mind was engraved  the certainty that he was useless. He decided to hurry on before the  girl found out the truth.    \"I can still walk,\" he said, \"and, while I can walk, I got to go  south. But--you gimme heart, lady. You gimme a pile of heart to keep  going. Maybe\"--he paused, uncertain what to say next, and yet  obviously she expected something more--\"I'll get a chance to come back  this way, and if I do, I'll see you! You can lay to that--I'll  see you!\"    He was gone before she could answer, and he was wondering why she had  looked down with that sudden color and that queer, pleased smile. It  would be long before Bull understood, but, even without understanding,  he found that his heart was lighter and an odd warmth suffused him.    The rising of the sun found him in the pale desert with the magic of  the hills growing distant behind him, and he settled to a different  step through the thin sand--a short, choppy step. His weight was  against him here, but it would be even a greater disadvantage to a  horseman, and with this in mind, he pressed steadily south.    Every day on that south trail was like a year in the life of Bull.  Heat and thirst wasted him, the constant labor of the march hardened  his muscles, and he got that forward look about his eyes, which comes  with shadows under the lids and a constant frown on the forehead. It  was long afterward that men checked up his march from date to date and  discovered that the distance between the shack of Bill Campbell and  Halstead in the South was one hundred and fifty miles over bitter  mountains and burning desert, and that Bull Hunter had made the  distance in five days.    All this was learned and verified later when Bull was a legend. When  he strode into Halstead on that late afternoon no one had ever heard  of the man out of the mountains. He was simply an oddity in a country  where oddities draw small attention.    Yet a rumor advanced before Bull. A child, playing in the incredible  heat of the sun, saw the dusty giant heaving in the distance and ran  to its mother, frightened, and the worn-faced mother came to the porch  and shaded her eyes to look. She passed on the word with a call that  traveled from house to house. So that, when Bull entered the long,  irregular street of Halstead, he found it lined on either side by  children, old men, women. It was almost as though they had heard of  the thing he had come to do and were there to watch.    Bull shrank from their eyes. He would far rather have slipped around  the back of the village and gone toward its center unobserved. A pair  of staring eyes to Bull was like the pointing of a loaded gun. He put  unspoken sentences upon every tongue, and the sentences were those he  had heard so often from his uncle and his uncle's sons.    \"Too big to be any good.\"    \"Bull's got the size of a hoss, and as a hoss he'd do pretty well, but  he ain't no account as a man.\"    His life had been paved with such burning remarks as these. Many an  evening had been long agony to him as the three sat about and baited  him. He hurried down the street, the pulverized sand squirting up  about his heavy boots and drifting in a mist behind him. When he was  gone an old man came out and measured those great strides with his eye  and then stretched his legs vainly to cover the same marks. But this,  of course, Bull did not see, and he would not have understood it, had  he seen, except as a mockery.    He paused in"]]]
