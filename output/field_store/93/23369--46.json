Many new sorts have lately been obtained and  brought into notice in this country; and this facility of the peach to  multiply its varieties will no doubt be taken advantage of by  propagators.    _The Nectarine_.--This, it is allowed by all writers, is certainly a  child of cultivation: there being no wild plant from which it could be  derived, except the almond. It is therefore a collateral branch with,  or rather of, the peach: of this no better proof can be given, than  the circumstance that nectarines are sometimes produced by a peach  tree.    _The Orange_.--This endless family of fruits it is probable had the  small but useful wild lime for its progenitor. The monstrous shaddock,  citrons of all shapes and sizes, oranges and lemons, are all  varieties, obtained in the course of long cultivation.    (_To be concluded in our next_.)           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.    \"I am but a Gatherer and disposer of other men's stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *      TO CHLOE, AT SIXTY.        Those teeth, as white as orient pearls    Stolen from th' Indian deep,    Those locks, whose light and auburn curls    Soft on thy shoulders sleep,    Expose a woman to the sight    None but old friends can know;    Thy locks were grey, thy teeth not white,    Some twenty years ago.             *       *       *       *       *      Wilkes used to say, that a gentleman did not always require a footman  to carry a parcel, for there were three things which he might always  carry openly in his hand,--a book, a paper of snuff, and a string of  fish.           *       *       *       *       *      HEREDITARY TALENT IN ACTORS.    \"Families are chequered as in brains, so in bulk.\"--FULLER.      The children of many obscure performers have become eminent: but there  are very few instances in which the descendant of a considerable actor  or actress has been distinguished. To take instances within recent  recollection, or of the present day, for example--Mr. Elliston has a  son upon the stage: with none of the striking talent of the father.  Mr. Henry Siddons, the son of Mrs. Siddons, was a very bad actor  indeed. Lewis had two sons upon the stage, neither of them of any  value. Mr. Dowton has two sons (or had), in the same situation. And  Mrs. Glover's two daughters will never rise above mediocrity. On the  other hand, Mr. Macready and Mr. Wallack, are both sons of very low  actors; and the late Mr. John Bannister and Mr. Tokely were similarly  descended. Almost the only modern instance of the immediate descendant  of a valuable performer turning out well, was in the case of Mrs.  Jordan's daughter, Mrs. Alsop; who was very nearly as good an actress  as her mother. We doubt, too, if there is an instance on record of a  very young man being a considerable actor.           *       *       *       *       *      PRISON TORTURE.      A horrible instance of human vengeance occurred a short time since, at  Minden, in Westphalia. The object was a person who, from conscientious  motives, peculiar to the religious body of which he was a member, had  refused to serve in the militia. He was placed in a cell, the floor and  sides of which were closely studded with projecting spikes, or pieces of  sharpened iron resembling the blades of knives. The individual remained  in this state for twenty-four hours, and the punishment was repeated  at three distinct intervals. It is considered a rare occurrence for a  person to survive the second infliction of this species of cruelty.  In this instance, however, the sufferer did not perish--_From the last  Report of the Prison Discipline Society_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE.      As her Grace was one day rambling in the neighbourhood of Chiswick,  she was overtaken by a violent storm, and accordingly took shelter,  in a cottage where she happened to be unknown. Among other topics she  introduced with her usual affability, she asked the poor woman if  she knew the Duchess of Devonshire? \"Know her, (answered the woman,)  _everybody_ has cause to know her here; never was there a better lady  born.\" \"I am afraid you are mistaken, (said her Grace); from what I  understand of her, she is no better than she should be.\" \"I am sure  _you_ are no better than you should be, (returned the poor woman,) to  find fault with the Duchess; but you'll never be worthy to wipe her  shoes.\" \"Well then, (rejoined her Grace,) I must be beholden to _you_,  as they are at present very dirty.\" The good woman perceiving the  awkward mistake, ran to perform the office with great humility, and  received an ample reward.           *       *       *       *       *      KITCHEN CONUNDRUM.        \"Come Thomas,\" says Kitty, \"pray make us a pun,--    You're goodnatured and never refuse;\"      \"Ask coachee,\" says Tom, \"_he's_ the fellow for Fun,--    For he knows the way to _a-mews_.\"      Says coachee, \"Why Thomas you puzzle my brains,    For you never can bridle your wit;\"      \"But how comes it, that I, tho' exposed to the _reins_    Ev'ry day, never _suffer a bit_?\"           *       *       *       *       *      DEAR TIMES.      After the union with Ireland, when the Irish members had taken their  seats, one of them, in the heat of his maiden speech, blustered out,  \"Now, dare Mr. Speaker,\" which, of course, set the house in an  immoderate fit of laughter. When the tumult had subsided, Sheridan  observed, \"that the honourable gentleman was perfectly in order,  since, thanks to the ministry, everything at that time was  immoderately _dear_.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11378"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 289, (#8)"],[1,"  Mosaic, though an ancient art, is not merely a revived, but an improved  one; for the Romans only used coloured marbles, or natural stones in its  composition, which admitted of comparatively little variety; but the  invention of smalts has given it a far wider range, and made the  imitation of painting far closer. The mosaic work at Florence is totally  different to this, being merely inlaying in _pietre dure_, or natural  precious stones, of every variety, which forms beautiful, and very  costly imitations of shells, flowers, figures, &c. but bears no  similitude to painting.    Besides this government establishment at Rome, there are hundreds of  artists, or artisans, who carry on the manufactory of mosaics on a small  scale. Snuff-boxes, rings, necklaces, brooches, earrings, &c. are made  in immense quantity; and since the English flocked in such numbers to  Rome, all the streets leading to the Piazza di Spagna are lined with the  shops of these _Musaicisti_, &c.    Oriental shells are made at Rome into beautiful cameos, by the white  outer surface being cut away upon the deeper coloured internal part,  forming figures in minute bassi relievi. The subjects are chiefly taken  from ancient gems, and sometimes from sculpture and painting. The shells  used for this purpose are chiefly brought from the Levant; and these  shell cameos make remarkably beautiful ornaments. Hundreds of artists  also find support at Rome, in making casts, sulphurs, &c. from ancient  gems and medals, and in selling or fabricating antiques. Marble and  stone-cutting are also beautifully executed both at Rome and  Florence--_Abridged, (but interspersed) from \"Rome in the 19th  Century.\"_             *       *       *       *       *    THE GATHERER.    \"I am but a Gatherer and disposer of other men's stuff.\"--Wotton.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ****    Moria pur quando vuol non e bisogna mutar ni faccia ni voci per esser un  Angelo.--The words addressed by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, to the  beautiful Nun at Murano.

The following is the original, epistle of this famous lunatic to the  matron of Bedlam; No other proof is necessary of her insanity:--    Madam,--I've recollected perhaps 'tis necessary to acquaint you upon  what account I continue here yet, _maim_, after making you privy to my  great concerns, _madam_ I only wait for alteration of the globe which  belongs to this house, _maim_ and if the time is almost expired I wish  to know it _maim_.

NICHOLSON.           *       *       *       *       *    LADY ARCHER, Formerly Miss West, lived to a good age--a proof that  cosmetics are not so fatal as has been supposed. Nature had given her a  fine aquiline nose, like, the princesses of the house of Austria, and  she did not fail to give herself a complexion. She resembled a fine old  wainscotted painting with the face and features shining through a thick  incrustation of copal varnish.    Her ladyship was for many years the wonder of the fashionable world,  envied by all the ladies that frequented the court. She had a splendid  house in Portland-place, with _et caetera_ equal in brilliancy and  beauty to, or rather surpassing those of any of her contemporaries.  Magnificent appendages were a sort of scenery. She gloried in milk-white  horses to her carriage--the coachman and footman in grand shewy  liveries--the carriage lined with a silk calculated to exhibit the  complexion, &c. &c.    I recollect, however, to have seen the late Mrs. Robinson go far beyond  all this in the rich exuberance of her genius; a yellow lining to her  landau, with a black footman, to contrast with her beautiful countenance  and fascinating figure, and thus render both more lovely. Lady Archer's  house at Barnes Elms Terrace, had an elegance of ornaments and drapery  to strike the senses, and yet powerfully addressed to the imagination.  She could give an insinuating interest to the scenes about her; which  other eyes were viewing. Her kitchen garden and pleasure ground of five  acres--the Thames running in front as if appertaining to the  grounds--the apartments most tastefully decorated in the Chinese  style--a fine conservatory opening, into the principal apartment with  grapes, slow peaches, &c. at the end a magnificent sofa, with a superb  curtain all displayed with a peculiar grace and to the greatest  advantage. Much praise was due to her arrangement of green and hot-house  plants, the appellations of which she was well acquainted with, as also  everything relating to their history.--_from the Papers of the late  Alexander Stephens, Esq._           *       *       *       *       *    TO SUBSCRIBERS.
