He reached there just about the time the  buffalo were being driven in, and shot a cow, which looked very scabby, but  was really very fat. Then he helped the old women to butcher, and when they  had taken the meat to camp, he said to them, \"Now take all the choice fat  pieces, and hang them up so that those who live in the bear lodge will  notice them.\"    They did this, and pretty soon the old chief bear said to his children: \"Go  out now, and look around. The people have finished killing by this  time. See where the nicest pieces are, and bring in some nice back fat.\" A  young bear went out of the lodge, stood up and looked around, and when it  saw this meat close by, at the old women's lodge, it went over and began to  pull it down. \"Hold on there,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"What are you doing  here, taking the old women's meat?\" and he hit him over the head with a  stick that he had. The young bear ran home crying, and said to his father,  \"A young man has hit me on the head.\" Then all the bears, the father and  mother, and uncles and aunts, and all the relations, were very angry, and  all rushed out toward the old women's lodge.    K[)u]t-o'-yis killed them all, except one little child bear, a female,  which escaped. \"Well,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"you can go and breed bears, so  there will be more.\"    Then said K[)u]t-o'-yis to the old women: \"Now, grand-mothers, where are  there any more people? I want to travel around and see them.\" The old women  said: \"The nearest ones are at the point of rocks (on Sun River). There is  a pis'kun there.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis travelled off toward this place, and  when he reached the camp, he entered an old woman's lodge.    The old woman set before him a plate of bad food. \"How is this?\" he  asked. \"Have you nothing better than this to set before a stranger? You  have a pis'kun down there, and must get plenty of fat meat. Give me some  pemmican.\" \"We cannot do that,\" the old woman replied, \"because there is a  big snake here, who is chief of the camp. He not only takes the best  pieces, but often he eats a handsome young woman, when he sees one.\" When  K[)u]t-o'-yis heard this he was angry, and went over and entered the  snake's lodge. The women were cooking up some sarvis berries. He picked up  the dish, and ate the berries, and threw the dish out of the door. Then he  went over to where the snake was lying asleep, pricked him with his knife,  and said: \"Here, get up. I have come to see you.\" This made the snake  angry. He partly raised himself up and began to rattle, when K[)u]t-o'-yis  cut him into pieces with his knife. Then he turned around and killed all  his wives and children, except one little female snake, which escaped by  crawling into a crack in the rocks. \"Oh, well,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"you  can go and breed young snakes, so there will be more. The people will not  be afraid of little snakes.\" K[)u]t-o'-yis said to the old woman, \"Now you  go into this snake's lodge and take it for yourself, and everything that is  in it.\"    Then he asked them where there were some more people. They told him that  there were some people down the river, and some up in the mountains. But  they said: \"Do not go there, for it is bad, because Ai-sin'-o-ko-ki (Wind  Sucker) lives there. He will kill you.\" It pleased K[)u]t-o'-yis to know  that there was such a person, and he went to the mountains. When he got to  the place where Wind Sucker lived, he looked into his mouth, and could see  many dead people there,--some skeletons and some just dead. He went in, and  there he saw a fearful sight. The ground was white as snow with the bones  of those who had died. There were bodies with flesh on them; some were just  dead, and some still living. He spoke to a living person, and asked, \"What  is that hanging down above us?\" The person answered that it was Wind  Sucker's heart. Then said K[)u]t-o'-yis: \"You who still draw a little  breath, try to shake your heads (in time to the song), and those who are  still able to move, get up and dance. Take courage now, we are going to  have the ghost dance.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis bound his knife, point upward, to  the top of his head and began to dance, singing the ghost song, and all the  others danced with him; and as he danced up and down, the point of the  knife cut Wind Sucker's heart and killed him. K[)u]t-o'-yis took his knife  and cut through Wind Sucker's ribs, and freed those who were able to crawl  out, and said to those who could still travel to go and tell their people  that they should come here for the ones who were still alive but unable to  walk.    Then he asked some of these people: \"Where are there any other people? I  want to visit all the people.\" They said to him: \"There is a camp to the  westward up the river, but you must not take the left-hand trail going up,  because on that trail lives a woman, a handsome woman, who invites men to  wrestle with her and then kills them. You must avoid her.\" This was what  K[)u]t-o'-yis was looking for. This was his business in the world, to kill  off all the bad things. So he asked the people just where this woman lived,  and asked where it was best to go to avoid her. He did this, because he did  not wish the people to know that he wanted to meet her.    He started on his way, and at length saw this woman standing by the  trail. She called out to him, \"Come here, young man, come here; I want to  wrestle with you.\" \"No,\" replied the young man, \"I am in a hurry. I cannot  stop.\" But the woman called again, \"No, no, come now and wrestle once with  me.\" When she had called him four times, K[)u]t-o'-yis went up to her. Now  on the ground, where this woman wrestled with people, she had placed many  broken and sharp flints, partly hiding them by the grass. They seized each  other, and began to wrestle over these broken flints, but K[)u]t-o'-yis  looked at the ground and did not step on them. He watched his chance, and  suddenly gave the woman a wrench, and threw her down on a large sharp  flint, which cut her in two; and the parts of her body fell asunder.    Then K[)u]t-o'-yis went on, and after a while came to where a woman kept a  sliding place; and at the far end of it there was a rope, which would trip  people up, and when they were tripped, they would fall over a high cliff  into deep water, where a great fish would eat them. When this woman saw him  coming, she cried out, \"Come over here, young man, and slide with me.\"  \"No,\" he replied, \"I am in a hurry.\" She kept calling him, and when she  had called the fourth time, he went over to slide with her. \"This sliding,\"  said the woman, \"is a very pleasant pastime.\" \"Ah!\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"I  will look at it.\" He looked at the place, and, looking carefully, he saw  the hidden rope. So he started to slide, and took out his knife, and when  he reached the rope, which the woman had raised, he cut it, and when it  parted, the woman fell over backward into the water, and was eaten up by  the big fish.    Again he went on, and after a while he came to a big camp. This was the  place of a man-eater. K[)u]t-o'-yis called a little girl he saw near by,  and said to her: \"Child, I am going into that lodge to let that man-eater  kill and eat me. Watch close, therefore, and when you can get hold of one  of my bones, take it out and call all the dogs, and when they have all come  up to you, throw it down and cry out, 'K[)u]t-o'-yis, the dogs are eating  your bones!'\"    Then K[)u]t-o'-yis entered the lodge, and when the man-eater saw him, he  cried out, \"_O'ki, O'ki,\"_ and seemed glad to see him, for he was a fat  young man. The man-eater took a large knife, and went up to K[)u]t-o'-yis,  and cut his throat, and put him into a great stone kettle to cook. When the  meat was cooked, he drew the kettle from the fire, and ate the body, limb  by limb, until it was all eaten up.    Then the little girl, who was watching, came up to him, and said, \"Pity me,  man-eater, my mother is hungry and asks you for those bones.\" So the old  man bunched them up together and handed them to her. She took them out, and  called all the dogs to her, and threw the bones down to the dogs, crying  out, \"Look out, K[)u]t-o'-yis; the dogs are eating you!\" and when she said  that, K[)u]t-o'-yis arose from the pile of bones.    Again he went into the lodge, and when the man-eater saw him, he cried out,  \"How, how, how! the fat young man has survived,\" and seemed  surprised. Again he took his knife and cut K[)u]t-o'-yis' throat, and threw  him into the kettle. Again, when the meat was cooked, he ate it up, and  again the little girl asked for the bones, which he gave her; and, taking  them out, she threw them to the dogs, crying, \"K[)u]t-o'-yis, the dogs are  eating you!\" and K[)u]t-o'-yis again arose from the bones.    When the man-eater had cooked him four times, he again went into the lodge,  and, seizing the man-eater, he threw him into the boiling kettle, and his  wives and children too, and boiled them to death.    The man-eater was the seventh and last of the bad animals and people who  were destroyed by K[)u]t-o'-yis.        THE BAD WIFE      I    There was once a man who had but one wife. He was not a chief, but a very  brave warrior. He was rich, too, so he could have had plenty of wives if he  wished; but he loved his wife very much, and did not want any more. He was  very good to this woman. She always wore the best clothes that could be  found. If any other woman had a fine buckskin dress, or something very  pretty, the man would buy it for her.    It was summer. The berries were ripe, and the woman kept saying to her  husband, \"Let us go and pick some berries for winter.\" \"No,\" replied the  man. \"It is dangerous now. The enemy is travelling all around.\" But still  the woman kept teasing him to go. So one day he told her to get ready. Some  other women went, too."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#8)"],[1," other times when driven in  straits, _in answer to prayer_ God has enabled us to procure necessary  help, which was difficult to obtain.    \"In 1874, while on my way to see my mother in Pennsylvania--who had just  been paralyzed, and died the next week--I was suddenly paralyzed in my  left arm, by which, I have since been helpless and useless. After coming  here to live, being in want of a man to lift me in and out of bed, dress  me, etc., for which we inquired of people, and prayed to God to send us  the needed help. We had not means to hire and pay any person to do such  work, even if he could be found. Soon the right one came, in the person  of a young German, who was tramping through the country in search of  employment and food; was ready and glad to do any work for a living. For  pay that satisfied him and us, he staid in the family over a year,  working out doors and in; could be trusted to do business with money,  and return every cent correctly. After being with us over a year, when  we needed him no longer, he obtained a situation in a good family, where  he is now living. In many instances, I have prayed to be healed of  special sickness, always using what remedies I thought best, yet asking  the divine blessing on their use.\"      HEALING.      \"For over three years, I was troubled with frequent raising of blood  from my right lung, which physicians failed to cure. Of this I prayed to  be relieved; after which, the soreness healed, and for several years it  has ceased to trouble me.\"      THAT $18.75.      A man who had led a very wicked life, was converted and hopefully saved.  Previous to this time, a debt of $18.75 had not given him the slightest  thought. After receiving a new heart, he distinctly heard God's command,  \"Pay what thou owest;\" so called on his creditor, and urged him to send  to his house and get a bureau, table and looking-glass, which he desired  him to sell and pay himself the sum due him; but, not wishing to deprive  his debtor of such necessary articles, refused, saying he would wait  till he could pay. The 18th of November was set, and, as the day  approached, the prospect was no brighter; and when the night of the 17th  came around, he spent it in prayer that God would deliver him, and rose  from his knees at daybreak, with the full assurance that \"He knoweth how  to deliver.\"    On passing down a street the next morning, on his way to business, a man  who kept a large store was standing in the door-way, and called to him  to stop a minute. Wondering what could be the nature of the call, he  retraced his steps, to hear this astonishing news: \"_For three days I  have been impressed with the idea that I must give you_ $18.75, _and for  three days have been trying to ascertain why I must give you this  amount, for I do not owe any man a penny_. I cannot get rid of the  thought, and if you value my peace of mind, I beg you take the money!\"  Seeing, instantly, the hand of God in it, he told the story to the  astonished storekeeper, then left to pay his debt with the money so  strangely given. His creditor, surprised to see him so promptly on time,  questioned him as to the manner of obtaining it, thinking, perhaps, he  had made a great sacrifice to do so. On being told just how it was given  him, said, \"_I won't take it; keep it. If God is as near to people as  that, I don't want it; it seems as if it had come directly from his  Almighty hand_.\" The result was the conversion of both the storekeeper  and creditor, to whom the incident came as the undoubted evidence of  God's presence among them.      GOD SENT THE BAG OF FLOUR.      In about the year 1830, in Central New York, there was a time of great  scarcity of provisions. Grain was very high, and difficult to be  obtained at any price; and, of course, families of limited means were  very much straitened. In one family, the wife and mother of six  children, a Godly woman, worked at her trade (tailoress) to the extent  of her ability, and prayed earnestly that God would deliver them from  pressing want. Husband and children all knew of their need, and of the  fervent prayers of the wife and mother for their supply; but no one knew  by what means the supply was to come. Every day, as their scanty means  were being consumed, the prospect grew darker. On the farm was a large  quantity of pine timber. Four miles from there, in the next town, lived  a man who needed some shingles; and, casting about him to see where he  should obtain a supply, thought he would go and purchase a pine tree,  and himself and man go into the woods and work it up into shingles. As  he was about starting, the thought occurred to him, \"Perhaps they may be  in want of wheat flour--a bag cannot come amiss in this time of  scarcity.\" So, putting two bushels in a bag, he proceeded to the next  town, entered the house, and made known his errand, saying, \"I have  brought along two bushels of flour towards paying for the tree, thinking  you might be in want of it in this time of scarcity, and I knew you live  six or seven miles from the mill, and have no horse.\" \"That is in answer  to prayer,\" said the noble woman; and the husband believed it, though  not a praying man. When, at night, the oldest son came in, the mother  said to him, \"God has answered our prayers, and sent a bag of flour.\" It  is believed that, while this was not miraculous, it was as directly the  interposition of God, as feeding Elijah by the ravens; and it was in  direct answer to prayer for that special blessing.\"      INCIDENTS FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF A CITY MISSIONARY.--A PRAYER FOR SUPPER  ANSWERED.      An educated, accomplished lady, reduced to the very lowest round of  poverty's ladder, whom we shall call Mrs. X----, bears unfailing  testimony to God's hearing and answering the prayer of faith. The  daughter came up-stairs one day to announce the utter emptiness of the  larder. There was not even a piece of dry bread, nor a drawing of tea;  not a potato, nor a bean; and \"Charles, poor fellow, will come home from  his work at six, tired and so hungry; what _shall_ we do, mother?\"    \"The Lord will send us something, before he comes,\" said Mrs. X----. So,  for three hours more the daughter waited. \"Mother, it is five o'clock,  and the Lord has not sent us anything.\" \"He will, my dear, before  half-past six;\" and the widow went in an adjoining room, to ask that her  daughter might not feel it vain to call upon God. In fifteen minutes,  the door-bell rang violently, and a gentleman, valise in hand, said,  \"Mrs. X----, I left the room which I hired of you one year ago, in a  great hurry, you will remember; and I owed you five dollars. I have not  been in the city since, and am rushing out of it again--jumped off the  car just to give you this money. Good-bye.\"      RELIEF FROM A CREDITOR'S DEMANDS.      \"At another time, being sorely pressed by a heartless creditor, and  almost beside herself, she concluded to walk out and get free from the  insupportable burden, by change of air and scene for two or three hours.  Passing the house of a friend, just returned from Europe, she called for  a few moments, and was presented with a small and peculiar plant,  brought from Wales. All the way home she was asking the Lord to release  her from this relentless creditor, and all the way home a man, without  her knowledge, was following her. Arrived at her own stoop, he suddenly  confronted her, bowed, apologized for the liberty, but said he had not  had a sight of that dear old plant since he left home; and if she would  sell it to him, he would gladly give her ten dollars for it. As that was  half the sum for which she was persecuted, and would probably relieve  her from annoyance until she could raise the balance, she accepted the  offer.\"      TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS NEEDED AND GIVEN AT THE LAST MOMENT.      \"At the time of her husband's death, there were _two hundred dollars_  due an institute, for board and tuition of their two little boys. His  death was the flood-gate opened, which let in a successive torrent of  perplexities, losses, dilemmas, delays, law-suits, etc. She had not been  able to pay that bill; the principal was importunate, persevering,  bitter, and, at last, abusive. She cried to the Lord for a week, day and  night, almost without ceasing. Then, a gentleman whom she had taken to  her own house and carefully nursed through a dangerous illness, three  years before, called to say good-bye. He was on his way to a Bremen  steamer, and all other adieus were said, all his baggage on board,  except the valise in his hand. Might her boy ride down to the wharf and  see him off? Of course she was glad to consent. When her son returned he  brought back a letter, which opened, she found to contain _two hundred  dollars_ and the words, 'Not that money can ever express my gratitude,  but the enclosed may be useful for gas-bills or some other little  household matter.'\"      HOW THE LORD REPAID A GENEROUS GIFT.      \"Some gentlemen, urged to contribute to a most worthy cause, said, 'Go  first to Mr. Z.--whatever he gives, we will.' Mr. Z., upon application,  concluded to make his neighbors do something worth while, and, as he was  expecting a thousand dollars in a very few days, subscribed the whole of  that. Upon the arrival of the vessel which was to pay his subscription,  he found the difference in exchange between certain countries, had  swelled his thousand dollars to _twenty-two hundred_.\"      THE ASTONISHED GIVER.      \"A gentleman, not marching in the ranks of 'cheerful givers,' was urged  to bestow five dollars toward the 'Fresh Air Fund.' 'He could not;  business wretched; poor enough himself,' and all the well known line of  excuses. The friend assured him, if the Lord did not more than make it  up to him, before the end of the week, he himself would return the  money. To those terms he agreed, quite sure he should call on Saturday  and get back the $5. But, the very next morning, he"]]]
