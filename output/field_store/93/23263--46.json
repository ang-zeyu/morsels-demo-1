These  traditions are softened by the influence of years into simply idealizing,  in the mind of every country-bred New Englander, the peculiar refreshing  scent of the southernwood as a typical Sabbath-day fragrance. Half a  century ago, the pretty feathery pale-green shrub grew in every country  door-yard, humble or great, throughout New England; and every church-going  woman picked a branch or spray of it when she left her home on Sabbath  morn. To this day, on hot summer Sundays, many a staid old daughter of  the Puritans may be seen entering the village meeting-house, clad in  a lilac-sprigged lawn or a green-striped barege,--a scanty-skirted,  surplice-waisted relic of past summers,--with a lace-bordered silk cape  or a delicate, time-yellowed, purple and white cashmere scarf on her bent  shoulders, wearing on her gray head a shirred-silk or leghorn bonnet, and  carrying in her lace-mitted hand a fresh handkerchief, her spectacle-case  and well-worn Bible, and a great sprig of the sweet, old-fashioned  \"lad's-love.\" A rose, a bunch of mignonette would be to her too gay a posy  for the Lord's House and the Lord's Day. And balmier breath than was  ever borne by blossom is the pure fragrance of green growing  things,--southernwood, mint, sweet fern, bayberry, sweetbrier. No rose is  half so fresh, so countrified, so memory-sweet.    The benches and the pew-seats in the old churches were never cushioned.  Occasionally very old or feeble women brought cushions to meeting to sit  upon. It is a matter of recent tradition that Colonel Greenleaf caused a  nine days' talk in Newbury town at the beginning of this century when  he cushioned his pew. The widow of Sir William Pepperell, who lived in  imposing style, had her pew cushioned and lined and curtained with  worsted stuff, and carpeted with a heavy bear-skin. This worn, faded, and  moth-eaten furniture remained in the Kittery church until the year 1840,  just as when Lady Pepperell furnished and occupied the pew. Nor were even  the seats of the pulpit cushioned. The \"cooshoons\" of velvet or leather,  which were given by will to the church, and which were kept in the pulpit,  and were nibbled by the squirrels, were for the Bible, not the minister, to  rest upon.    In many churches--in Durham, Concord and Sandwich--the pews had  swing-shelves, \"leaning shelves,\" upon which a church attendant could rest  his paper and his arm when taking notes from the sermon, as was at one time  the universal custom, and in which even school-boys of a century ago had  to take part. Funny stories are told of the ostentatious notes taken by  pompous parishioners who could neither write nor read, but who could  scribble, and thus cut a learned figure.    The doors of the pews were usually cut down somewhat lower than the  pew-walls, and frequently had no top-rails. They sometimes bore the name of  the pew-owner painted in large white letters. They were secured when  closed by clumsy wooden buttons. In many country congregations the elderly  men--stiff old farmers--had a fashion of standing up in the middle of the  sermon to stretch their cramped limbs, and they would lean against and hang  over the pew door and stare up and down the aisle. In Andover, Vermont,  old Deacon Puffer never let a summer Sunday pass without thus resting and  diverting himself. One day, having ill-secured the wooden button at the  door of his pew, the leaning-place gave way under his weight, and out he  sprawled on all-fours, with a loud clatter, into the middle of the aisle,  to the amusement of the children, and the mortification of his wife.    Thus it may be seen, as an old autobiography phrases it, \"diversions was  frequent in meeting, and the more duller the sermon, the more likely it was  that some accident or mischief would be done to help to pass the time.\"          V.    Seating the Meeting.        Perhaps no duty was more important and more difficult of satisfactory  performance in the church work in early New England than \"seating the  meeting-house.\" Our Puritan forefathers, though bitterly denouncing all  forms and ceremonies, were great respecters of persons; and in nothing was  the regard for wealth and position more fully shown than in designating the  seat in which each person should sit during public worship. A committee of  dignified and influential men was appointed to assign irrevocably to each  person his or her place, according to rank and importance. Whittier wrote  of this custom:--      \"In the goodly house of worship, where in order due and fit,    As by public vote directed, classed and ranked the people sit;    Mistress first and goodwife after, clerkly squire before the clown,    From the brave coat, lace embroidered: to the gray frock shading down.\"    In many cases the members of the committee were changed each year or at  each fresh seating, in order to obviate any of the effects of partiality  through kinship, friendship, personal esteem, or debt. A second committee  was also appointed to seat the members of committee number one, in order  that, as Haverhill people phrased it, \"there may be no Grumbling at them  for picking and placing themselves.\"    This seating committee sent to the church the list of all the attendants  and the seats assigned to them, and when the list had been twice or thrice  read to the congregation, and nailed on the meeting-house door, it became a  law. Then some such order as this of the church at Watertown, Connecticut,  was passed: \"It is ordered that the next Sabbath Day every person shall  take his or her seat appointed to them, and not go to any other seat where  others are placed: And if any one of the inhabitants shall act contrary, he  shall for the first offence be reproved by the deacons, and for a second  pay a fine of two shillings, and a like fine for each offence ever  after.\" Or this of the Stratham church: \"When the comety have Seatid the  meeting-house every person that is Seatid shall set in those Seats or pay  Five Shillings Pir Day for every day they set out of There seats in a  Disorderly Manner to advance themselves Higher in the meeting-house.\" These  two church-laws were very lenient. In many towns the punishments and fines  were much more severe. Two men of Newbury were in 1669 fined L27 4s.  each for \"disorderly going and setting in seats belonging to others.\" They  were dissatisfied with the seats assigned to them by the seating committee,  and openly and defiantly rebelled. Other and more peaceable citizens  \"entred their Decents\" to the first decision of the committee and asked for  reconsideration of their special cases and for promotion to a higher pew  before the final orders were \"Jsued.\"    In all the Puritan meetings, as then and now in Quaker meetings, the men  sat on one side of the meeting-house and the women on the other; and they  entered by separate doors. It was a great and much-contested change when  men and women were ordered to sit together \"promiscuoslie.\" In front,  on either side of the pulpit (or very rarely in the foremost row in the  gallery), was a seat of highest dignity, known as the \"foreseat,\" in which  only the persons of greatest importance in the community sat.    Sometimes a row of square pews was built on three sides of the ground  floor, and each pew occupied by separate families, while the pulpit was  on the fourth side. If any man wished such a private pew for himself and  family, he obtained permission from the church and town, and built it at  his own expense. Immediately in front of the pulpit was either a long seat  or a square inclosed pew for the deacons, who sat facing the congregation.  This was usually a foot or two above the level of the other pews, and was  reached by two or three steep, narrow steps. On a still higher plane was a  pew for the ruling elders, when ruling elders there were. The magistrates  also had a pew for their special use. What we now deem the best seats,  those in the middle of the church, were in olden times the free seats.    Usually, on one side of the pulpit was a square pew for the minister's  family. When there were twenty-six children in the family, as at least one  New England parson could boast, and when ministers' families of twelve  or fourteen children were far from unusual, it is no wonder that we find  frequent votes to \"inlarge the ministers wives pew the breadth of the  alley,\" or to \"take in the next pue to the ministers wives pue into her  pue.\" The seats in the gallery were universally regarded in the early  churches as the most exalted, in every sense, in the house, with the  exception, of course, of the dignity-bearing foreseat and the few private  pews.    It is easy to comprehend what a source of disappointed anticipation,  heart-burning jealousy, offended dignity, unseemly pride, and bitter  quarrelling this method of assigning scats, and ranking thereby, must have  been in those little communities. How the goodwivcs must have hated the  seating committee! Though it was expressly ordered, when the committee  rendered their decision, that \"the inhabitants are to rest silent and  sett down satysfyed,\" who can still the tongue of an envious woman or an  insulted man? Though they were Puritans, they were first of all men and  women, and complaints and revolts were frequent. Judge Sewall records that  one indignant dame \"treated Captain Osgood very roughly on account of  seating the meeting-house.\" To her the difference between a seat in the  first and one in the second row was immeasurably great. It was not alone  the Scribes and Pharisees who desired the highest seats in the synagogue.    It was found necessary at a very early date to \"dignify the meeting,\"  which was to make certain seats, though in different localities, equal in  dignity; thus could peace and contented pride be partially restored. For  instance, the seating committee in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8675"],[0,"Welsh Fairy-Tales and Other Stories (#7)"],[1,"day of his seven years Billy was penniless, and he went to  the taproom of his favourite inn, which was full.    \"Well, boys,\" said Billy, \"we must have some money to-night. I'll treat  you, and give you a pound each,\" and rising, he placed his tumbler in  the middle of the table, and wished for twenty pounds. No sooner had  he wished than a ball of fire came through the ceiling, and the twenty  sovereigns fell into the tumbler. Everyone was taken aback, and there  was a noise as if a bomb had burst, and the fireball disappeared, and  rolled down the garden path, the landlord following it. After this  they each drank what they liked, and Billy gave them a sovereign apiece  before he went home.    The next morning he was in his smithy making a pair of horseshoes, when  the devil came in and said:    \"Well, Billy, I'll want you this morning.\"    \"Yes; all right. Take hold of this sledge-hammer, and give me a few  hammers till I finish this job before I go.\"    So the devil seized the hammer and began striking the anvil, but he  couldn't stop.    So Billy laughed, and locked him in, and was away three days. During  this time the people collected round the smithy, and peeped through the  cracks in the shutter, for they could hear the hammer going night and  day.    At the end of three days Billy returned and opened the door, and the  devil said, \"Oh, Billy, you've played a fine trick to me; let me go.\"    \"What are you going to give me if I let you go?\"    \"Seven years more, twice the money, and two days' grace for wishing for  what you like.\"    The devil paid his money and disappeared, and Billy shut the smithy and  took to gambling and drinking, so that at the end of seven years he was  without a penny, and working again in his smithy.    On the last night of the seven years he went to his favourite  public-house again, and wished for five pounds.    After he wished, a little man entered and spat the sovereigns into the  tumbler, and they all drank all night.    Next morning Billy went back to his smithy. The devil, who had grown  suspicious, turned himself into a sovereign and appeared on the floor.  Billy seized the sovereign and clapped it into his purse. Then he took  his purse and lay it upon the anvil, and began to beat it with his  sledge-hammer, when the devil began to call out, \"Spare my poor limbs,  spare my poor limbs!\"    \"How much now if I let you go?\" asked Billy    \"Seven more years, three times the money, and one day in which to wish  for what you like.\"    Billy took the sovereign out of his purse and threw it away, when he  found his money in the smithy.    Billy carried on worse than ever; gambled and drank and raced,  squandering it all before his seven years was gone. On the last day of  his term he went to his favourite inn as usual and wished for a tumbler  full of sovereigns. A little man with a big head, a big nose, and big  mouth, a little body, and little legs, with clubbed feet and a forked  tail, brought them in and put them in the tumbler. The drunkards in the  room got scared when they saw the little man, for he looked all glowing  with fire as he danced on the table. When he finished, he said, \"Billy,  to-morrow morning our compact is up.\"    \"I know it, old boy, I know it, old boy!\" said Billy. Then the devil ran  out and disappeared, and the people began to question Billy:    \"What is that? I think it is you, Mister Duffy, he is after.\"    \"Oh, it is nothing at all,\" said Billy.    \"I should think there was something,\" said the man.    \"I am afraid my house will get a bad name,\" croaked the landlord.    \"Not in the least! You are only a coward,\" said Billy.    \"But in the name of God, what is it all about?\" asked an old man.    \"Oh, you'll see by-and-bye,\" said Billy; \"it is nothing at all.\"    Next morning Billy went to his smithy, but the devil would not come near  it.    So he went to his house, and began to quarrel with his wife, and whilst  he was quarrelling the devil walked in and said:    \"Well, Mr. Duffy, I am ready for you.\"    \"Ah, yes; just sit down and wait a minute or two. I have some papers I  want to put to rights before I go.\"    So the devil sat down in the arm-chair, and Billy went to the smithy and  heated a pair of tongs red-hot, and coming back, he got the devil by the  nose, and pulled it out as though it had been soft iron. And the devil  began yelling, but he could not move, and Billy kept drawing the nose  out till it was long enough to reach over the window, when he put an  old bell-topper on the end of it. And the devil yelled, and snorted fire  from his nose.    The whole of the village crowded round Billy's, house--at a safe  distance--calling out, \"Billy and the devil! The devil and Billy Duffy!\"    The devil got awful savage, and blackguarded Billy Duffy terribly; but  it was useless. Billy kept him there for days, till he got civil and  said:    \"Mr. Duffy, what will you let me go for?\"    \"Only one thing: I am to live the rest of my life without you, and have  as much gold as I like.\"    The devil agreed, so Billy let him go; and immediately he grew rich. He  lived to a good old age squandering money all the time, but at last he  died and when he got to the gates of hell the clerk said \"Who are you?\"  \"Billy Duffy,\" said he. And when the devil, who was standing near,  heard, he said:    \"Good God! bar the gates and double-lock them for if this Billy Duffy  the blacksmith gets in he will ruin us all.\"    Old Billy saw a pair of red-hot tongs, which he picked up, and seized  the devil by the nose. When the devil pulled back his head he left a  red-hot bit of his nose in the tongs.    Then Billy Duffy went up to the gates of heaven and St. Peter asked him  who he was.    \"Billy Duffy the blacksmith,\" he answered.    \"No admittance! You are a bold, bad man,\" said St. Peter.    \"Good God! what will I do?\" said Billy, and he went back to the earth,  where he and the piece of the devil's nose melted into a ball of fire,  and he roves the earth till this day as a will-o'-the-wisp.          THE STORY OF JOHN 0' GROATS.    He was an old seaman, with weather-beaten face and black eyes, that had  looked upon many lands and many sights.    \"Well, indeed, I'll tell you about Johnny Groats as it was told to me  one night in the trades,\" he said, blowing a whiff of smoke from his  wheezy pipe.    \"Well, in olden times there was a rich lord, who owned all the property  looking on to the Pentlands--an awful place in bad weather; indeed, in  any weather.    \"He was a lone man, for his wife was dead, and his son had turned out to  be a rake and a spendthrift, spending all his substance upon harlots and  entertainments.    \"Now this lord had a factor, by name John o' Scales, a stingy, cunning  man, who robbed his master all he could during the week, and prayed hard  for forgiveness on the Sabbath.    \"The lord, who was getting very old, was much grieved on account of his  son's behaviour. 'He'll spend everything when I am gone, and the estates  will go into other hands,' the old man said to himself.\"            *       *       *       *       *    \"One fine morning in summer the factor received orders to build a hut by  the sea, and plant bushes and trees round about it. 'But don't make  the door to fit close; leave the space of a foot at the bottom, so the  leaves can blow in, for I want the hut to shoot sea-fowl as they flight,  and it is cold standing on the bare ground,' said the old man.    \"The factor carried out his master's instructions, but not without  suspicion of ulterior motives on his master's part. However, when he saw  my lord shooting the birds and stuffing many of them his suspicions  were allayed, and the factor thought that, after all, though his master  wanted the hut for flight-shooting, still he must be getting softening  of the brain, for it was very eccentric that he should take up this new  hobby in his old age.    \"So the old lord was never disturbed in his hut by curious and ill-timed  visits.    \"After a time the lord died, and was laid with his fathers, the prodigal  inheriting the property.    \"The old castle was then the scene of perpetual feastings and card  parties, so that in a few years the property was heavily mortgaged, the  old factor advancing the money.    \"Things went apace, until one day the factor informed the young  spendthrift that he had spent everything, and the estates were no longer  his, so he gave him a few pounds, and turned him out.    \"When the news spread round the countryside his old friends began to  drop off, until at last the spendthrift found every door closed against  him.    \"When he had spent his last penny, the prodigal thought of the key which  his father had given him, saying, 'When you have spent everything, take  this key, and go to the hut.'    \"But he had lost the key long before.    \"Nevertheless, he went to the hut. It had a deserted appearance, being  overgrown with moss and lichens.    \"He managed to squeeze himself under the door, and when he stood up he  saw a rope, with a noose hanging from the centre of the roof. Pursuing  his investigations, he found a parchment nailed to the back of the door,  and in one corner stood an old three-legged stool. There was nothing  else in the damp, mouldy room, so he began to read the parchment.    \"'Thou art come to beggary; end thy miserable existence, for it is thy  father's wish,' he read.    \"He was dazed, and looked from the parchment to the rope, and from the  rope to the parchment, saying to himself: 'Well, I have come to that, I  must follow my father's wish.'    \"So he got the stool and put it under the noose, and standing upon it,  adjusted the rope with trembling fingers round his neck, when he said,  hoarsely: 'Father, I do thy bidding,' and he kicked the stool from under  him.    \"Immediately he heard a crash, and found himself lying upon the leaves,  with a feeling that his neck had been jerked off. However, he soon  recovered, and, "]]]
