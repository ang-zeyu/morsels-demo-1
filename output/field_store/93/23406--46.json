Full  PUBLICITY, PRINTED STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS, and occasional DISCUSSIONS  and inquiries at GENERAL MEETINGS, are the only safeguards; and a due  degree of VIGILANCE should be exercised on those who DISCOURAGE these  principles. Of the Royal Society, I shall speak in a succeeding page;  and I regret to add, that I might have said more. My object is to amend  it; but, like all deeply-rooted complaints, the operation which alone  can contribute to its cure, is necessarily painful. Had the words of  remonstrance or reproof found utterance through other channels, I had  gladly been silent, content to support by my vote the reasonings of the  friend of science and of the Society. But this has not been the case,  and after frustrated efforts to introduce improvements, I shall now  endeavour, by the force of plain, but perhaps painful truths, to direct  public opinion in calling for such a reform, as shall rescue the Royal  Society from contempt in our own country, from ridicule in others.    On the next five societies in the list, I shall offer no remarks. Of the  Geological, I shall say a few words. It possesses all the freshness, the  vigour, and the ardour of youth in the pursuit of a youthful science,  and has succeeded in a most difficult experiment, that of having an oral  discussion on the subject of each paper read at its meetings. To say of  these discussions, that they are very entertaining, is the least part  of the praise which is due to them. They are generally very instructive,  and sometimes bring together isolated facts in the science which,  though insignificant when separate, mutually illustrate each other,  and ultimately lead to important conclusions. The continuance of these  discussions evidently depends on the taste, the temper, and the good  sense of the speakers. The things to be avoided are chiefly verbal  criticisms--praise of each other beyond its reasonable limits, and  contest for victory. This latter is, perhaps, the most important of the  three, both for the interests of the Society and of truth. With regard  to the published volumes of their Transactions, it may be remarked,  that if members were in the habit of communicating their papers to the  Society in a more finished state, it would be attended with several  advantages; amongst others, with that of lightening the heavy duties of  the officers, which are perhaps more laborious in this Society than in  most others. To court publicity in their accounts and proceedings,  and to endeavour to represent all the feelings of the Society in the  Council, and to avoid permanent Presidents, is a recommendation not  peculiarly addressed to this Society, but would contribute to the  well-being of all.    Of the Astronomical Society, which, from the nature of its pursuits,  could scarcely admit of the discussions similar to those of the  Geological, I shall merely observe, that I know of no secret which has  caused its great success, unless it be attention to the maxims which  have just been stated.    On the Zoological Society, which affords much rational amusement to the  public, a few hints may at present suffice. The largeness of its income  is a frightful consideration. It is too tempting as the subject for  jobs, and it is too fluctuating and uncertain in its amount, not to  render embarrassment in the affairs of the Society a circumstance likely  to occur, without the greatest circumspection. It is most probable, from  the very recent formation of this Institution, that its Officers and  Council are at present all that its best friends could wish; but it  is still right to mention, that in such a Society, it is essentially  necessary to have men of business on the Council, as well as persons  possessing extensive knowledge of its pursuits. It is more dangerous  in such a Society than in any other, to pay compliments, by placing  gentlemen on the Council who have not the qualifications which are  requisite; a frequent change in the members of the Council is desirable,  in order to find out who are the most regular attendants, and most  qualified to conduct its business. Publicity in its accounts and  proceedings is, from the magnitude of its funds, more essential to the  Zoological than to any other society; and it is rather a fearful omen,  that a check was attempted to be given to such inquiries at the last  anniversary meeting. If it is to be a scientific body, the friends of  science should not for an instant tolerate such attempts.    It frequently happens, that gentlemen take an active part in more  than one scientific society: in that case, it may be useful to derive  instruction as to their merits, by observing the success of their  measures in other societies.    The Asiatic Society has, amongst other benefits, caused many valuable  works to be translated, which could not have otherwise been published.    The Horticultural Society has been ridden almost to death, and is  now rousing itself; but its constitution seems to have been somewhat  impaired. There are hopes of its purgation, and ultimate restoration,  notwithstanding a debt of 19,000L., which the Committee of Inquiry have  ascertained to exist. This, after all, will not be without its advantage  to science, if it puts a stop to HOUSE-LISTS, NAMED BY ONE OR TWO  PERSONS,--to making COMPLIMENTARY councillors,--and to auditing the  accounts WITHOUT EXAMINING EVERY ITEM, or to omitting even that form  altogether.    The Medico-Botanical Society suddenly claimed the attention of the  public; its pretensions were great--its assurance unbounded. It speedily  became distinguished, not by its publications or discoveries, but by the  number of princes it enrolled in its list. It is needless now to expose  the extent of its short-lived quackery; but the evil deeds of that  institution will long remain in the impression they have contributed  to confirm throughout Europe, of the character of our scientific  establishments. It would be at once a judicious and a dignified course,  if those lovers of science, who have been so grievously deceived in this  Society, were to enrol upon the latest page of its history its highest  claim to public approbation, and by signing its dissolution, offer the  only atonement in their power to the insulted science of their country.  As with a singular inversion of principle, the society contrived to  render EXPULSION* the highest HONOUR it could confer; so it remains  for it to exemplify, in suicide, the sublimest virtue of which it is  capable. [* They expelled from amongst them a gentleman, of whom it is  but slight praise to say, that he is the first and most philosophical  botanist of our own country, and who is admired abroad as he is  respected at home. The circumstance which surprised the world was not  his exit from, but his previous entrance into that Society.]        CHAPTER IV. STATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN PARTICULAR.    As the venerable first parent of English, and I might perhaps say, of  European scientific societies; as a body in the welfare of which, in  the opinions of many, the interests of British science are materially  involved, I may be permitted to feel anxiously, and to speak more in  detail.          SECTION 1. MODE OF BECOMING A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.    I have no intention of stating what ought to be the qualifications of  a Fellow of the Royal Society; but, for years, the practical mode of  arriving at that honour, has been as follows:--    A. B. gets any three Fellows to sign a certificate, stating that he  (A. B.) is desirous of becoming a member, and likely to be a useful and  valuable one. This is handed in to the Secretary, and suspended in the  meeting-room. At the end of ten weeks, if A. B. has the good fortune to  be perfectly unknown by any literary or scientific achievement, however  small, he is quite sure of being elected as a matter of course. If, on  the other hand, he has unfortunately written on any subject connected  with science, or is supposed to be acquainted with any branch of it, the  members begin to inquire what he has done to deserve the honour;  and, unless he has powerful friends, he has a fair chance of being  black-balled. [I understand that certificates are now read at the  Council, previously to their being hung up in the meeting-room; but I am  not aware that this has in the slightest degree diminished their number,  which was, at the time of writing this note, TWENTY-FOUR.]    In fourteen years' experience, the few whom I have seen rejected,  have all been known persons; but even in such cases a hope  remains;--perseverance will do much, and a gentleman who values so  highly the distinction of admission to the Royal Society, may try  again; and even after being twice black-balled, if he will a third time  condescend to express his desire to become a member, he may perhaps  succeed, by the aid of a hard canvass. In such circumstances, the odds  are much in favour of the candidate possessing great scientific claims;  and the only objection that could then reasonably be suggested, would  arise from his estimating rather too highly a distinction which had  become insignificant from its unlimited extension.    It should be observed, that all members contribute equally, and that  the sum now required is fifty pounds. It used, until lately, to be  ten pounds on entrance, and four pounds annually. The amount of this  subscription is so large, that it is calculated to prevent many men  of real science from entering the Society, and is a very severe tax on  those who do so; for very few indeed of the cultivators of science  rank amongst the wealthy classes. Several times, whilst I have been  consulting books or papers at Somerset House, persons have called to  ask the Assistant-secretary the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#8)"],[1,"                               _Aside_.]    And so my desire has really scope for its indulgence. Yet I am  still distracted by doubts, remembering the pleasantry of her  female companions respecting her wish for a husband.    PRIYAMVADA.      [_Looking with a smile at [S']AKOONTALA, and then turning towards                                                         the KING.]    You seem desirous, Sir, of asking something further.               [[S']AKOONTALA _makes a chiding gesture with her finger_.    KING.    You conjecture truly. I am so eager to hear the particulars of  your friend's history, that I have still another question to ask.    PRIYAMVADA.    Scruple not to do so. Persons who lead the life of hermits may be  questioned unreservedly.    KING.    I wish to ascertain one point respecting your friend.      Will she be bound by solitary vows    Opposed to love, till her espousals only?    Or ever dwell with these her cherished fawns,    Whose eyes, in lustre vying with her own,    Return her gaze of sisterly affection?    PRIYAMVADA.    Hitherto, Sir, she has been engaged in the practice of religious  duties, and has lived in subjection to her foster-father; but it  is now his fixed intention to give her away in marriage to a  husband worthy of her.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    His intention may be easily carried into effect.      Be hopeful, O my heart, thy harrowing doubts    Are past and gone; that which thou didst believe    To be as unapproachable as fire,    Is found a glittering gem that may be touched.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                 [_Pretending anger_.    Anasuya, I shall leave you.    ANASUYA.    Why so?    [S']AKOONTALA.    That I may go and report this impertinent Priyamvada to the  venerable matron, Gautami[29].    ANASUYA.    Surely, dear friend, it would not be right to leave a  distinguished guest before he has received the rites of  hospitality, and quit his presence in this wilful manner.                [[S']AKOONTALA, _without answering a word, moves away_.    KING.            [_Making a movement to arrest her departure, but checking                                                   himself. Aside_.    Ah! a lover's feelings betray themselves by his gestures.      When I would fain have stayed the maid, a sense    Of due decorum checked my bold design;    Though I have stirred not, yet my mien betrays    My eagerness to follow on her steps.    PRIYAMVADA.                                         [_Holding [S']AKOONTALA back_.    Dear [S']akoontala, it does not become you to go away in this  manner.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                         [_Frowning_.    Why not, pray?    PRIYAMVADA.    You are under a promise to water two more shrubs for me. When you  have paid your debt, you shall go, and not before.                                          [_Forces her to turn back_.    KING.    Spare her this trouble, gentle maiden. The exertion of watering  the shrubs has already fatigued her.      The water-jar has overtasked the strength    Of her slim arms; her shoulders droop, her hands    Are ruddy with the glow of quickened pulses;    E'en now her agitated breath imparts    Unwonted tremor to her heaving breast;    The pearly drops that mar the recent bloom    Of the [S']irisha pendent in her ear,    Gather in clustering circles on her cheek;    Loosed is the fillet of her hair; her hand    Restrains the locks that struggle to be free.    Suffer me, then, thus to discharge the debt for you.       [_Offers a ring to_ PRIYAMVADA. _Both the maidens, reading the              name_ DUSHYANTA _on the seal, look at each other with                                                         surprise_.    KING.    Nay, think not that I am King Dushyanta. I am only the King's  officer, and this is the ring which I have received from him as  my credentials.    PRIYAMVADA.    The greater the reason you ought not to part with the ring from  your finger. I am content to release her from her obligation at  your simple request.    [_With a smile_.]    Now, [S']akoontala, my love, you are at liberty to retire, thanks  to the intercession of this noble stranger, or rather of this  mighty prince.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                            [_Aside_.    My movements are no longer under my own control.                                                            [_Aloud_.    Pray, what authority have you over me, either to send me away or  keep me back?    KING.                          [_Gazing at_ [S']AKOONTALA. _Aside_.    Would I could ascertain whether she is affected towards me as I  am towards her! At any rate, my hopes are free to indulge  themselves. Because,      Although she mingles not her words with mine,    Yet doth her listening ear drink in my speech;    Although her eye shrinks from my ardent gaze,    No form but mine attracts its timid glances.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    O hermits, be ready to protect the animals belonging to our  hermitage. King Dushyanta, amusing himself with hunting, is near  at hand.      Lo! by the feet of prancing horses raised,    Thick clouds of moving dust, like glittering swarms    Of locusts, in the glow of eventide,    Fall on the branches of our sacred trees    Where hang the dripping vests of woven bark,    Bleached by the waters of the cleansing fountain.    And see!      Scared by the royal chariot in its course,    With headlong haste an elephant invades    The hallowed precincts of our sacred grove;    Himself the terror of the startled deer,    And an embodied hindrance to our rites.    The hedge of creepers clinging to his feet,    Feeble obstruction to his mad career,    Is dragged behind him in a tangled chain;    And with terrific shock one tusk he drives    Into the riven body of a tree,    Sweeping before him all impediments.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    Out upon it! my retinue are looking for me, and are disturbing  this holy retreat. Well! there is no help for it; I must go and  meet them.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Noble Sir, we are terrified by the accidental disturbance caused  by the wild elephant. Permit us to return to the cottage.    KING.                                                 [_Hastily_.    Go, gentle maidens. It shall be our care that no injury happen to  the hermitage.                                                      [_All rise up_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    After such poor hospitality, we are ashamed to request the honour  of a second visit from you.    KING.    Say not so. The mere sight of you, sweet maidens, has been to me  the best entertainment.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Anasuya, a pointed blade of Ku[s']a-grass [30] has pricked my foot;  and my bark-mantle is caught in the branch of a Kuruvaka-bush[31].  Be so good as to wait for me until I have disentangled it.                [_Exit with her two companions, after making pretexts                for delay, that she may steal glances at the_ KING.    KING.    I have no longer any desire to return to the city. I will  therefore rejoin my attendants, and make them encamp somewhere in  the vicinity of this sacred grove. In good truth, [S']akoontala has  taken such possession of my thoughts, that I cannot turn myself  in any other direction.      My limbs drawn onward leave my heart behind,    Like silken pennon borne against the wind.           *       *       *       *       *          ACT II.      SCENE.--_A plain on the skirts of the forest.    Enter the Jester_ [32] MA[T.]HAVYA, _in a melancholy mood_.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                            [_Sighing_.    Heigh-ho! what an unlucky fellow I am! worn to a shadow by my  royal friend's sporting propensities. 'Here's a deer!' 'There  goes a boar!' 'Yonder's a tiger!' This is the only burden of our  talk, while in the heat of the meridian sun we toil on from  jungle to jungle, wandering about in the paths of the woods,  where the trees afford us no shelter. Are we thirsty? We have  nothing to drink but the dirty water of some mountain stream  mixed with dry leaves, which give it a most pungent flavour. Are  we hungry? We have nothing to eat but roast game[33], which we  must swallow down at odd times, as best we can. Even at night  there is no peace to be had. Sleeping is out of the question,  with joints all strained by dancing attendance upon my sporting  friend; or if I do happen to doze, I am awakened at the very  earliest dawn by the horrible din of a lot of rascally beaters  and huntsmen, who must needs surround the wood before sunrise,  and deafen me with their clatter. Nor are these my only troubles.  Here's a fresh grievance, like a new boil rising upon an old  one! Yesterday, while we were lagging behind, my royal friend  entered yonder hermitage after a deer; and there, as ill-luck  would have it, caught sight of a beautiful girl, called  [S']akoontala, the hermit's daughter. From that moment, not another  thought about returning to the city! and all last night not a  wink of sleep did he get for thinking of the damsel. What is to  be done? At any rate I will be on the watch for him as soon as he  has finished his toilet.                                       [_Walking and looking about_.]    Oh! here he comes, attended by the Yavana women[34], with bows in  their hands, wearing garlands of wild flowers. What shall I do? I  have it. I will pretend to stand in the easiest attitude for  resting my bruised and crippled limbs.                                        [_Stands leaning on a staff_.    _Enter King_ DUSHYANTA, _followed by a retinue, in the manner  described_.    KING.      True, by no easy conquest may I win her,    Yet are my hopes encouraged by her mien,    Love is not yet triumphant; but, methinks,    The hearts of both are ripe for his delights.
