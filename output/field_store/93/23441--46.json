It is plain, therefore, that the  same indicator must be employed for both standardization and analysis,  and that, if this is done, accurate results are obtainable.    The following table (Note 1) illustrates the variations in the volume  of an alkali solution (tenth-normal sodium hydroxide) required to  produce an alkaline end-point when run into 10 cc. of tenth-normal  sulphuric acid, diluted with 50 cc. of water, using five drops of each  of the different indicator solutions.    ====================================================================                 |            |          |             |     INDICATOR   |   N/10     |   N/10   |COLOR IN ACID|COLOR IN ALKA-                 | H_{2}SO_{4}|   NaOH   |SOLUTION     |LINE SOLUTION  _______________|____________|__________|_____________|______________                 |    cc.     |    cc.   |    cc.      |  Methyl orange  |    10      |   9.90   |   Red       |  Yellow  Lacmoid        |    10      |  10.00   |   Red       |  Blue  Litmus         |    10      |  10.00   |   Red       |  Blue  Rosalic acid   |    10      |  10.07   |   Yellow    |  Pink  Phenolphthalein|    10      |  10.10   |   Colorless |  Pink  ====================================================================    It should also be stated that there are occasionally secondary  changes, other than those outlined above, which depend upon the  temperature and concentration of the solutions in which the indicators  are used. These changes may influence the sensitiveness of an  indicator. It is important, therefore, to take pains to use  approximately the same volume of solution when standardizing that is  likely to be employed in analysis; and when it is necessary, as is  often the case, to titrate the solution at boiling temperature, the  standardization should take place under the same conditions. It is  also obvious that since some acid or alkali is required to react with  the indicator itself, the amount of indicator used should be uniform  and not excessive. Usually a few drops of solution will suffice.    The foregoing statements with respect to the behavior of indicators  present the subject in its simplest terms. Many substances other than  those named may be employed, and they have been carefully studied to  determine the exact concentration of H^{+} ions at which the color  change of each occurs. It is thus possible to select an indicator  for a particular purpose with considerable accuracy.

Wiesbaden, 1901.]      PREPARATION OF INDICATOR SOLUTIONS    A !methyl orange solution! for use as an indicator is commonly made by  dissolving 0.05-0.1 gram of the compound (also known as Orange III) in  a few cubic centimeters of alcohol and diluting with water to 100 cc.  A good grade of material should be secured. It can be successfully  used for the titration of hydrochloric, nitric, sulphuric, phosphoric,  and sulphurous acids, and is particularly useful in the determination  of bases, such as sodium, potassium, barium, calcium, and ammonium  hydroxides, and even many of the weak organic bases. It can also be  used for the determination, by titration with a standard solution of  a strong acid, of the salts of very weak acids, such as carbonates,  sulphides, arsenites, borates, and silicates, because the weak acids  which are liberated do not affect the indicator, and the reddening of  the solution does not take place until an excess of the strong acid  is added. It should be used in cold, not too dilute, solutions. Its  sensitiveness is lessened in the presence of considerable quantities  of the salts of the alkalies.    A !phenolphthalein solution! is prepared by dissolving 1 gram of the  pure compound in 100 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. This indicator is  particularly valuable in the determination of weak acids, especially  organic acids. It cannot be used with weak bases, even ammonia. It  is affected by carbonic acid, which must, therefore, be removed by  boiling when other acids are to be measured. It can be used in hot  solutions. Some care is necessary to keep the volume of the solutions  to be titrated approximately uniform in standardization and in  analysis, and this volume should not in general exceed 125-150 cc. for  the best results, since the compounds formed by the indicator undergo  changes in very dilute solution which lessen its sensitiveness.    The preparation of a !solution of litmus! which is suitable for use  as an indicator involves the separation from the commercial litmus of  azolithmine, the true coloring principle. Soluble litmus tablets are  often obtainable, but the litmus as commonly supplied to the market is  mixed with calcium carbonate or sulphate and compressed into lumps. To  prepare a solution, these are powdered and treated two or three times  with alcohol, which dissolves out certain constituents which cause a  troublesome intermediate color if not removed. The alcohol is decanted  and drained off, after which the litmus is extracted with hot water  until exhausted. The solution is allowed to settle for some time, the  clear liquid siphoned off, concentrated to one-third its volume and  acetic acid added in slight excess. It is then concentrated to a  sirup, and a large excess of 95 per cent. alcohol added to it. This  precipitates the blue coloring matter, which is filtered off, washed  with alcohol, and finally dissolved in a small volume of water and  diluted until about three drops of the solution added to 50 cc. of  water just produce a distinct color. This solution must be kept in an  unstoppered bottle. It should be protected from dust by a loose plug  of absorbent cotton. If kept in a closed bottle it soon undergoes a  reduction and loses its color, which, however, is often restored by  exposure to the air.    Litmus can be employed successfully with the strong acids and bases,  and also with ammonium hydroxide, although the salts of the latter  influence the indicator unfavorably if present in considerable  concentration. It may be employed with some of the stronger organic  acids, but the use of phenolphthalein is to be preferred.      PREPARATION OF STANDARD SOLUTIONS    !Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide. Approximate Strength!, 0.5 N      PROCEDURE.--Measure out 40 cc. of concentrated, pure hydrochloric  acid into a clean liter bottle, and dilute with distilled water to an  approximate volume of 1000 cc. Shake the solution vigorously for a  full minute to insure uniformity. Be sure that the bottle is not too  full to permit of a thorough mixing, since lack of care at this point  will be the cause of much wasted time (Note 1).    Weigh out, upon a rough balance, 23 grams of sodium hydroxide (Note  2). Dissolve the hydroxide in water in a beaker. Pour the solution  into a liter bottle and dilute, as above, to approximately 1000 cc.  This bottle should preferably have a rubber stopper, as the hydroxide  solution attacks the glass of the ground joint of a glass stopper, and  may cement the stopper to the bottle. Shake the solution as described  above.    [Note 1: The original solutions are prepared of a strength greater  than 0.5 N, as they are more readily diluted than strengthened if  later adjustment is desired.    Too much care cannot be taken to insure perfect uniformity of  solutions before standardization, and thoroughness in this respect  will, as stated, often avoid much waste of time. A solution once  thoroughly mixed remains uniform.]    [Note 2: Commercial sodium hydroxide is usually impure and always  contains more or less carbonate; an allowance is therefore made for  this impurity by placing the weight taken at 23 grams per liter. If  the hydroxide is known to be pure, a lesser amount (say 21 grams) will  suffice.]      COMPARISON OF ACID AND ALKALI SOLUTIONS    PROCEDURE.--Rinse a previously calibrated burette three times with the  hydrochloric acid solution, using 10 cc. each time, and allowing the  liquid to run out through the tip to displace all water and air  from that part of the burette. Then fill the burette with the acid  solution. Carry out the same procedure with a second burette, using  the sodium hydroxide solution.    The acid solution may be placed in a plain or in a glass-stoppered  burette as may be more convenient, but the alkaline solution should  never be allowed to remain long in a glass-stoppered burette, as it  tends to cement the stopper to the burette, rendering it useless. It  is preferable to use a plain burette for this solution.    When the burettes are ready for use and all air bubbles displaced from  the tip (see Note 2, page 17) note the exact position of the liquid in  each, and record the readings in the notebook. (Consult page 188.) Run  out from the burette into a beaker about 40 cc. of the acid and add  two drops of a solution of methyl orange; dilute the acid to about  80 cc. and run out alkali solution from the other burette, stirring  constantly, until the pink has given place to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1279"],[0,"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns (#8)"],[1,"still may fly them, O;       An' tho' at last they catch them fast,       Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O.
