Thus it is that from among them would in  some degree issue not only inventors and craftsmen and teachers, but  sorcerers and diviners, medicine-men and wizards, prophets and priests.  Such persons would be especially impelled to thought, because they would  realize that they were different from other people; treated with reverence  by some and with contempt by others, they would be compelled to face the  problems of their own nature and, indirectly, the problems of the world  generally. Moreover, Carpenter points out, persons in whom the masculine  and feminine temperaments were combined would in many cases be persons of  intuition and complex mind beyond their fellows, and so able to exercise  divination and prophecy in a very real and natural sense.[53]    This aptitude of the invert for primitive religion, for sorcery and  divination, would have its reaction on popular feeling, more especially  when magic and the primitive forms of religion began to fall into  disrepute. The invert would be regarded as the sorcerer of a false and  evil religion and be submerged in the same ignominy. This point has been  emphasized by Westermarck in the instructive chapter on homosexuality in  his great work on Moral Ideas.[54] He points out the significance of the  fact, at the first glance apparently inexplicable, that homosexuality in  the general opinion of medieval Christianity was constantly associated,  even confounded, with heresy, as we see significantly illustrated by the  fact that in France and England the popular designation for homosexuality  is derived from the Bulgarian heretics. It was, Westermarck believes,  chiefly as a heresy and out of religious zeal that homosexuality was so  violently reprobated and so ferociously punished.    In modern Europe we find the strongest evidence of the presence of what  may fairly be called true sexual inversion when we investigate the men of  the Renaissance. The intellectual independence of those days and the  influence of antiquity seem to have liberated and fully developed the  impulses of those abnormal individuals who would otherwise have found no  clear expression, and passed unnoticed.[55]    Muret, the Humanist, may perhaps be regarded as a typical example of the  nature and fate of the superior invert of the Renaissance. Born in 1526 at  Muret (Limousin), of poor but noble family, he was of independent,  somewhat capricious character, unable to endure professors, and  consequently he was mainly his own teacher, though he often sought advice  from Jules-Cesar Scaliger. Muret was universally admired in his day for  his learning and his eloquence, and is still regarded not only as a great  Latinist and a fine writer, but as a notable man, of high intelligence,  and remarkable, moreover, for courtesy in polemics in an age when that  quality was not too common. His portrait shows a somewhat coarse and  rustic but intelligent face. He conquered honor and respect before he died  in 1585, at the age of 59. In early life Muret wrote wanton erotic poems  to women which seem based on personal experience. But in 1553 we find him  imprisoned in the Chatelet for sodomy and in danger of his life, so that  he thought of starving himself to death. Friends, however, obtained his  release and he settled in Toulouse. But the very next year he was burnt in  effigy in Toulouse, as a Huguenot and sodomist, this being the result of a  judicial sentence which had caused him to flee from the city and from  France. Four years later he had to flee from Padua owing to a similar  accusation. He had many friends but none of them protested against the  charge, though they aided him to escape from the penalty. It is very  doubtful whether he was a Huguenot, and whenever in his works he refers to  pederasty it is with strong disapproval. But his writings reveal  passionate friendship for men, and he seems to have expended little energy  in combating a charge which, if false, was a shameful injustice to him. It  was after fleeing into Italy and falling ill of a fever from fatigue and  exposure that Muret is said to have made the famous retort (to the  physician by his bedside who had said: \"Faciamus experimentum in anima  vili\"): \"Vilem animam appellas pro qua Christus non dedignatus est  mori.\"[56]    A greater Humanist than Muret, Erasmus himself, seems as a young man, when  in the Augustinian monastery of Stein, to have had a homosexual attraction  to another Brother (afterward Prior) to whom he addressed many  passionately affectionate letters; his affection seems, however, to have  been unrequited.[57]    As the Renaissance developed, homosexuality seems to become more prominent  among distinguished persons. Poliziano was accused of pederasty. Aretino  was a pederast, as Pope Julius II seems also to have been. Ariosto wrote  in his satires, no doubt too extremely:--        \"Senza quel vizio son pochi umanisti.\"[58]    Tasso had a homosexual strain in his nature, but he was of weak and  feminine constitution, sensitively emotional and physically frail.[59]    It is, however, among artists, at that time and later, that homosexuality  may most notably be traced. Leonardo da Vinci, whose ideals as revealed in  his work are so strangely bisexual, lay under homosexual suspicion in his  youth. In 1476, when he was 24 years of age, charges were made against him  before the Florentine officials for the control of public morality, and  were repeated, though they do not appear to have been substantiated. There  is, however, some ground for supposing that Leonardo was imprisoned in his  youth.[60] Throughout life he loved to surround himself with beautiful  youths and his pupils were more remarkable for their attractive appearance  than for their skill; to one at least of them he was strongly attached,  while there is no record of any attachment to a woman. Freud, who has  studied Leonardo with his usual subtlety, considers that his temperament  was marked by \"ideal homosexuality.\"[61]    Michelangelo, one of the very chief artists of the Renaissance period, we  cannot now doubt, was sexually inverted. The evidence furnished by his own  letters and poems, as well as the researches of numerous recent  workers,--Parlagreco, Scheffler, J.A. Symonds, etc.,--may be said to have  placed this beyond question.[62] He belonged to a family of 5 brothers, 4  of whom never married, and so far as is known left no offspring; the fifth  only left 1 male heir. His biographer describes Michelangelo as \"a man of  peculiar, not altogether healthy, nervous temperament.\" He was indifferent  to women; only in one case, indeed, during his long life is there evidence  even of friendship with a woman, while he was very sensitive to the beauty  of men, and his friendships were very tender and enthusiastic. At the  same time there is no reason to suppose that he formed any physically  passionate relationships with men, and even his enemies seldom or never  made this accusation against him. We may probably accept the estimate of  his character given by Symonds:--        Michelangelo Buonarotti was one of those exceptional, but not      uncommon men who are born with sensibilities abnormally deflected      from the ordinary channel. He showed no partiality for women, and      a notable enthusiasm for the beauty of young men.... He was a man      of physically frigid temperament, extremely sensitive to beauty      of the male type, who habitually philosophized his emotions, and      contemplated the living objects of his admiration as amiable, not      only for their personal qualities, but also for their esthetical      attractiveness.[63]    A temperament of this kind seems to have had no significance for the men  of those days; they were blind to all homosexual emotion which had no  result in sodomy. Plato found such attraction a subject for sentimental  metaphysics, but it was not until nearly our own time that it again became  a subject of interest and study. Yet it undoubtedly had profound influence  on Michelangelo's art, impelling him to find every kind of human beauty in  the male form, and only a grave dignity or tenderness, divorced from every  quality that is sexually desirable, in the female form. This deeply rooted  abnormality is at once the key to the melancholy of Michelangelo and to  the mystery of his art.    Michelangelo's contemporary, the painter Bazzi (1477-1549), seems also to  have been radically inverted, and to this fact he owed his nickname  Sodoma. As, however, he was married and had children, it may be that he  was, as we should now say, of bisexual temperament. He was a great artist  who has been dealt with unjustly, partly, perhaps, because of the  prejudice of Vasari,--whose admiration for Michelangelo amounted to  worship, but who is contemptuous toward Sodoma and grudging of  praise,--partly because his work is little known out of Italy and not  very easy of access there. Reckless, unbalanced, and eccentric in his  life, Sodoma revealed in his painting a peculiar feminine softness and  warmth--which indeed we seem to see also in his portrait of himself at  Monte Oliveto Maggiore--and a very marked and tender feeling for  masculine, but scarcely virile, beauty.[64]    Cellini was probably homosexual. He was imprisoned on a charge of  unnatural vice and is himself suspiciously silent in his autobiography  concerning this imprisonment.[65]    In the seventeenth century another notable sculptor who has been termed  the Flemish Cellini, Jerome Duquesnoy (whose still more distinguished  brother Francois executed the Manneken Pis in Brussels), was an invert;  having finally been accused of sexual relations with a youth in a chapel  of the Ghent Cathedral, where he was executing a monument for the bishop,  he was strangled and burned, notwithstanding that much influence,  including that of the bishop, was brought to bear in his behalf.[66]    In "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#8)"],[1,"lar. This process goes on until the whole      of the internal stroma becomes tense and brilliantly injected      with blood.... In all essential points the menstruation or      pro-estrum of the human female is identical with that of      monkeys.... Estrus is possible only after the changes due to      pro-estrum have taken place in the uterus. A wave of disturbance,      at first evident in the external generative organs, extends to      the uterus, and after the various phases of pro-estrum have been      gone through in that organ, and the excitement there is      subsiding, it would seem as if the external organs gain renewed      stimulus, and it is then that estrus takes place.... In all      animals which have been investigated coition is not allowed by      the female until some time after the swelling and congestion of      the vulva and surrounding tissue are first demonstrated, and in      those animals which suffer from a considerable discharge of blood      the main portion of that discharge, if not the whole of it, will      be evacuated before sexual intercourse is allowed.\" (W. Heape,      \"The 'Sexual Season' of Mammals,\" _Quarterly Journal of      Microscopical Science_, vol. xliv, Part I, 1900. Estrus has since      been fully discussed in Marshall's _Physiology of Reproduction_.)      This description clearly brings out the fundamentally vascular      character of the process I have termed \"tumescence\"; it must be      added, however, that in man the nervous elements in the process      tend to become more conspicuous, and more or less obliterate      these primitive limitations of sexual desire. (See \"Sexual      Periodicity\" in the first volume of these _Studies_.)        Moll subsequently restated his position with reference to my      somewhat different analysis of the sexual impulse, still      maintaining his original view (\"Analyse des Geschlechtstriebes,\"      _Medizinische Klinik_, Nos. 12 and 13, 1905; also _Geschlecht und      Gesellschaft_, vol. ii, Nos. 9 and 10). Numa Praetorius      (_Jahrbuch fuer Sexeuelle Zwischenstufen_, 1904, p. 592) accepts      contrectation, tumescence, and detumescence as all being stages      in the same process, contrectation, which he defines as the      sexual craving for a definite individual, coming first. Robert      Mueller (_Sexualbiologie_, 1907, p. 37) criticises Moll much in      the same sense as I have done and considers that contrectation      and detumescence cannot be separated, but are two expressions of      the same impulse; so also Max Katte, \"Die Praeliminarien des      Geschlechtsaktes,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft_, Oct.,      1908, and G. Saint-Paul, _L'Homosexualite et les Types      Homosexuels_, 1910, p. 390.        While I regard Moll's analysis as a valuable contribution to the      elucidation of the sexual impulse, I must repeat that I cannot      regard it as final or completely adequate. As I understand the      process, contrectation is an incident in the development of      tumescence, an extremely important incident indeed, but not an      absolutely fundamental and primitive part of it. It is equally an      incident, highly important though not primitive and fundamental,      of detumescence. Contrectation, from first to last; furnishes      the best conditions for the exercise of the sexual process, but      it is not an absolutely essential part of the process and in the      early stages of zooelogical development it had no existence at      all. Tumescence and detumescence are alike fundamental,      primitive, and essential; in resting the sexual impulse on these      necessarily connected processes we are basing ourselves on the      solid bedrock of nature.        Moreover, of the two processes, tumescence, which in time comes      first, is by far the most important, and nearly the whole of      sexual psychology is rooted in it. To assert, with Moll, that the      sexual process may be analyzed into contrectation and      detumescence alone is to omit the most essential part of the      process. It is much the same as to analyze the mechanism of a gun      into probable contact with the hand, and a more or less      independent discharge, omitting all reference to the loading of      the gun. The essential elements are the loading and the      discharging. Contrectation is a part of loading, though not a      necessary part, since the loading may be effected mechanically.      But to understand the process of firing a gun and to comprehend      the mechanism of the discharge, we must insist on the act of      loading and not merely on the contact of the hand. So it is in      analyzing the sexual impulse. Contrectation is indeed highly      important, but it is important only in so far as it aids      tumescence, and so may be subordinated to tumescence, exactly as      it may also be subordinated to detumescence. It is tumescence      which is the really essential part of the process, and we cannot      afford, with Moll, to ignore it altogether.    Wallace opposed Darwin's theory of sexual selection, but it can scarcely  be said that his attitude toward it bears critical examination. On the one  hand, as has already been noted, he saw but one side of that theory and  that the unessential side, and, on the other hand, his own view really  coincided with the more essential elements in Darwin's theory. In his  _Tropical Nature_ he admitted that the male's \"persistency and energy win  the day,\" and also that this \"vigor and liveliness\" of the male are  usually associated with intense coloration, while twenty years later (in  his _Darwinism_) he admitted also that it is highly probable that the  female is pleased or excited by the male's display. But all that is really  essential in Darwin's theory is involved, directly or indirectly, in these  admissions.    Espinas, in 1878, in his suggestive book, _Des Societes Animales_,  described the odors, colors and forms, sounds, games, parades, and mock  battles of animals, approaching the subject in a somewhat more  psychological spirit than either Darwin or Wallace, and he somewhat more  clearly apprehended the object of these phenomena in producing mutual  excitement and stimulating tumescence. He noted the significance of the  action of the hermaphroditic snails in inserting their darts into each  other's flesh near the vulva in order to cause preliminary excitation. He  remarks of this whole group of phenomena: \"It is the preliminary of sexual  union, it constitutes the first act of it. By it the image of the male is  graven on the consciousness of the female, and in a manner impregnates it,  so as to determine there, as the effects of this representation descend to  the depths of the organism, the physiological modifications necessary to  fecundation.\" Beaunis, again, in an analysis of the sexual sensations, was  inclined to think that the dances and parades of the male are solely  intended to excite the female, not perceiving, however, that they at the  same time serve to further excite the male also.[24]    A better and more comprehensive statement was reached by Tillier, who, to  some extent, may be said to have anticipated Groos. Darwin, Tillier  pointed out, had not sufficiently taken into account the coexistence of  combat and courtship, nor the order of the phenomena. Courtship without  combat, Tillier argued, is rare; \"there is a normal coexistence of combat  and courtship.\"[25] Moreover, he proceeded, force is the chief factor in  determining the possession of the female by the male, who in some species  is even prepared to exert force on her; so that the female has little  opportunity of sexual selection, though she is always present at these  combats. He then emphasized the significant fact that courtship takes  place long after pairing has ceased, and the question of selection thus  been eliminated. The object of courtship, he concluded, is not sexual  selection by the female, but the sexual excitement of both male and  female, such excitement, he asserted, not only rendering coupling easier,  but favoring fecundation. Modesty, also, Tillier further argued, again  anticipating Groos, works toward the same end; it renders the male more  ardent, and by retarding coupling may also increase the secretions of the  sexual glands and favor the chances of reproduction.[26]        In a charming volume entitled _The Naturalist in La Plata_ (1892)      Mr. W.H. Hudson included a remarkable chapter on \"Music and      Dancing in Nature.\" In this chapter he described many of the      dances, songs, and love-antics of birds, but regarded all such      phenomena as merely \"periodical fits of gladness.\" While,      however, we may quite well agree with Mr. Hudson that conscious      sexual gratification on the part of the female is not the cause      of music and dancing performances in birds, nor of the brighter      colors and ornaments that distinguish the male, such an opinion      by no means excludes the conclusion that these phenomena are      primarily sexual and intimately connected with the process of      tumescence in both sexes. It is noteworthy that, according to      H.E. Howard (\"On Sexual Selection in Birds,\" _Zooelogist_, Nov.,      1903), color is most developed just before pairing, rapidly      becoming less beautiful--even within a few hours--after this, and      the most beautiful male is most successful in getting paired. The      fact that, as Mr. Hudson himself points out, it is at the season      of love that these manifestations mainly, if not exclusively,      appear, and that it is the more brilliant and highly endowed      males which play the chief part in them, only serves to confirm      such a conclusion. To argue, with Mr. Hudson, that they cannot be      sexual because they sometimes occur before the arrival of the      females, is much the same as to argue that the antics of a      kitten with a feather or a reel "]]]
