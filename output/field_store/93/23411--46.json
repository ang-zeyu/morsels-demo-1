Here, then, I had touched another complex, which, if followed  up, would lead me into the innermost depths and recesses of this old lady's  soul-life, into the holiest of holies of her mental life.    The writer will be pardoned for not here giving fuller histories, or for not  carrying out the analyses to their ultimate goals, or for not giving the  interpretations of the two dreams presented. That was not the primary object  of this communication.    I wish, in conclusion, to repeat that through the conscientious and most  far-reaching analysis of a single dream, or, in fact, of a single element of  a dream or a single element or stimulus in the objective or subjective  world, one may, at least not infrequently, unearth the full life history of  normal or abnormal individuals, and the genesis and evolution of  psychopathic affections.    The reader may justly inquire why the analyst should resort to dream  analysis instead of taking the history of the case in the usual way. In all  cases the patient should be permitted to tell her story in her own way.  This method of procedure, with cross questioning, may and should indeed be  sufficient to unravel the case for us in most cases. But if we find that we  have not gained the confidence of the patient and have not that condition of  being en rapport with the patient which is essential for progress and  success in the analysis, one may resort to dream analysis, not so much for  the purpose of following the royal road to what the Freudian school calls  \"the unconscious,\" but rather with the object of obtaining the confidence of  the patient and of having something definite to start with.        AN ACT OF EVERYDAY LIFE TREATED AS A PRETENDED DREAM AND INTERPRETED BY  PSYCHOANALYSIS    BY RAYMOND BELLAMY    Professor of Education, Emory and Henry College, Emory, Va.    A RECENT article by Brill, entitled \"Artificial Dreams and Lying,\"[1]  recalled to me a little work I did two years ago while engaged in making an  introductory study of dreams as a thesis at Clark University.  The part  which is hereby submitted is a fragment of a larger work and, being only a  sort of side issue, was never included in the thesis proper. I have made  only such changes as were made necessary by the fact that this is a fragment  and needed one or two minor changes to make it complete.    [1] Journal Abnormal Psychology, Vol. 9, No. 5.    Let me say at the beginning that I have the greatest and most profound  respect for Freudian theories as interpreted by G. Stanley Hall and other  men of like scholarly ability, but I have never been able to accept the more  extreme form of Freudianism as interpreted by some of the most prolific  writers in this field.  I have found that the charges made by Habermann[2]  are substantially true. I find it very helpful indeed, to try to interpret  my own dreams and to assist some of my students to do so according to the  Freudian formula, and to a certain point I believe these interpretations are  undoubtedly true. The question is to find the point beyond which the  interpretation becomes artificial.  Personally, I believe that this will  always have to be decided finally by the individual himself rather than by  some outsider who insists on reading in a certain interpretation. I have  come to believe that it is possible for one to become trained to the point  at which he is able to decide just how far the interpretation goes, or, at  least, to approximate it.    [2] Journal Abnormal Psychology, Vol. 9, No. 4.    With these few introductory remarks I shall submit the paper, which was  written in 1912.  I have not appended the rather long and cumbersome  bibliography from which I drew these references, but I can supply any  reference that is wanted.    If we examine the Freudian system, we find that it is impossible to disprove  this theory of dreams.  If we demonstrate that a dream has no sexual  connection whatever, they have only to say that it is the censor that  blinds, and, by resorting to symbolism and other such very present helps in  time of trouble, they show plainly that we were mistaken.  The situation is  the same as it would be if I declared that what I saw as blue appeared  yellow to the rest of the world. The disproof of this and of Freudianism are  equally impossible. But, on the other hand, have the Freudians presented any  proof or argument on the affirmative side of this question?  They are over  fond of saying, \"Freud has proven thus and so,\" but in what did the proof  consist? The great answer to all objections has been to analyze dreams and,  so far as I know, the attempt has never failed to show that the dream in  question conformed to the prescribed requirements.  And in truth, it is not  a difficult matter to analyze a dream a la Freud.  After a little practice,  especially if one has a vivid imagination and is somewhat suggestible, It is  possible to find the repressed sexual wish in every dream.  But if we use  such flexible and wonderful factors as the four mechanisms, and, above all,  symbolism, we can find the same things in any other experience.  By this I  mean that if we take a bit out of our daily life, a dream of some one else,  a fictitious story, an historical incident, or any other pictured situation  and PRETEND THAT IT IS ONE OF OUR OWN DREAMS and apply the Freudian  analysis, we find that it serves for this purpose as well as a real dream.  When this is the case, it is absurd to put any faith in the analysis of real  dreams, when carried to extremes.    As an illustration of the above statement, the following is a fairly typical  example.  The supposed \"dream\" is a commonplace bit out of my daily life.  This is chosen at random (although Jones would say such a thing is  impossible) and subjected to a dream analysis.    ANALYSIS OF FALSE DREAM    Dream.  I was walking along a street on a cold winter night. I looked down  at the cement walk and in this was set a piece of granite on which the  letters \"W. H.\" were cut.  Coming to the corner, I looked up and saw on a  short board which was nailed to a post, the name of the street, \"Queen  Street,\" The street running at right angles to this was King Street, and I  turned and went down this. After walking a short distance, I came to a house  from a window of which a light was shining.  The house number was \"23.\" I  took a key from my pocket, unlocked the door and entered.    Analysis.  In attempting to analyze this (so-called) dream, I was amazed to  find with how many past longings and emotionally-colored experiences it was  associated. I first took up the letters on the sidewalk, and as I repeated  them, letting my mind be as blank as possible in order that the associations  might be free, I gained an immediate response. \"W. H.\"--\"Which House\"--came  out as in answer to a question. With these words there was a definite visual  image of a young country farm youth standing talking to two persons in a  buggy. I remembered the incident in all its details. I was the young man and  these people were asking the way to a certain place, or at WHICH HOUSE they  should stop. As it so happened, I was at that time keeping company with a  young lady who lived at the very house concerning which they asked. I will  not go into detail any further at this point, for this is a real case and I  should be trespassing on personal ground. But any one who yet remembers his  boyhood courtship, with all its agonies and fears, its hopes and joys, its  disappointments and its pleasures, can see at a glance how important this  occasion is in throwing light on the meaning of the dream. Of course \"W. H.\"  stood for \"Which House.\"    I seemed to get no further in my associations with these letters at this  time, and my thoughts spontaneously turned to the name of the street.  \"Queen Street.\"  Even more readily and completely than in the other case,  there came a whole complex of associations. First there was the name and  image of Miss Agnes Queen, whom I had known for years.  But, strange to say,  the image was of this young lady standing and talking to a certain Mr.  Harding.  I saw them together but once, and it seemed passing strange that  this incident should be the one remembered in connection with the name. But  the associations were rapidly progressing, and I mentally reviewed parts of  three or four years during which I was working and closely associating with  this Mr. Harding.  Here I began to see some light. This Mr. Harding was in  all respects, at least as far as I knew him a man of good morals, but he was  much less particular in his social habits than I was.  He was engaged to a  young lady all the time I was with him, and wrote letters to her constantly;  but this fact did not prevent him from paying attentions to other young  women, and I was aware that he was more familiar with them than  conventionality would warrant.  In fact he made no attempt to be secret in  the matter, and often poked fun at me for my over sensitivity on the  subject.  Here was the key to a whole lot of meaning. The first year I was  with him, I had no sweetheart or any lady friend on whom to center my  affection or to whom I could write. There were a number of young men in our  \"squad,\" as it was called, and nearly all of them had correspondents and it  was a joke among us that I was \"out in the cold world with no one to love.\"  In reality, this was not so much a joke for me at the time, as I tried to  give the impression that it was, and I longed for the very thing of which we  joked.  The fact that I was out on the street on a cold winter night in this  dream symbolized being \"out in the cold world,\" as we had used the term  then.    I now took up the letters \"W. H.\" again, and the words \"White Horse\" came in  response to the stimulus.  With little hesitation I placed this as connected  with the Knights of the White Horse of whom Tennyson writes in his poems of  \"King Arthur's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I. (#8)"],[1,"them from whooping cough and other ailments. Snake  Stones were, moreover, a charm to ensure prosperity in general and to  repel evil spirits. When one of these priceless treasures was not on  active service, the owner kept it in an iron box to guard it against  fairies, who, as is well known, cannot abide iron.[40]    [Medicinal plants, water, are not allowed to touch the earth.]    Pliny mentions several medicinal plants, which, if they were to retain  their healing virtue, ought not to be allowed to touch the earth.[41]  The curious medical treatise of Marcellus, a native of Bordeaux in the  fourth century of our era, abounds with prescriptions of this sort; and  we can well believe the writer when he assures us that he borrowed many  of his quaint remedies from the lips of common folk and peasants rather  than from the books of the learned.[42] Thus he tells us that certain  white stones found in the stomachs of young swallows assuage the most  persistent headache, always provided that their virtue be not impaired  by contact with the ground.[43] Another of his cures for the same malady  is a wreath of fleabane placed on the head, but it must not touch the  earth.[44] On the same condition a decoction of the root of elecampane  in wine kills worms; a fern, found growing on a tree, relieves the  stomach-ache; and the pastern-bone of a hare is an infallible remedy for  colic, provided, first, it be found in the dung of a wolf, second, that  it docs not touch the ground, and, third, that it is not touched by a  woman.[45] Another cure for colic is effected by certain hocus-pocus  with a scrap of wool from the forehead of a first-born lamb, if only the  lamb, instead of being allowed to fall to the ground, has been caught by  hand as it dropped from its dam.[46] In Andjra, a district of Morocco,  the people attribute many magical virtues to rain-water which has fallen  on the twenty-seventh day of April, Old Style; accordingly they collect  it and use it for a variety of purposes. Mixed with tar and sprinkled on  the door-posts it prevents snakes and scorpions from entering the house:  sprinkled on heaps of threshed corn it protects them from the evil eye:  mixed with an egg, henna, and seeds of cress it is an invaluable  medicine for sick cows: poured over a plate, on which a passage of the  Koran has been written, it strengthens the memory of schoolboys who  drink it; and if you mix it with cowdung and red earth and paint rings  with the mixture round the trunks of your fig-trees at sunset on  Midsummer Day, you may depend on it that the trees will bear an  excellent crop and will not shed their fruit untimely on the ground. But  in order to preserve these remarkable properties it is absolutely  essential that the water should on no account be allowed to touch the  ground; some say too that it should not be exposed to the sun nor  breathed upon by anybody.[47] Again, the Moors ascribe great magical  efficacy to what they call \"the sultan of the oleander,\" which is a  stalk of oleander with a cluster of four pairs of leaves springing from  it. They think that the magical virtue is greatest if the stalk has been  cut immediately before midsummer. But when the plant is brought into the  house, the branches may not touch the ground, lest they should lose  their marvellous qualities.[48] In the olden days, before a Lithuanian  or Prussian farmer went forth to plough for the first time in spring, he  called in a wizard to perform a certain ceremony for the good of the  crops. The sage seized a mug of beer with his teeth, quaffed the liquor,  and then tossed the mug over his head. This signified that the corn in  that year should grow taller than a man. But the mug might not fall to  the ground; it had to be caught by somebody stationed at the wizard's  back, for if it fell to the ground the consequence naturally would be  that the corn also would be laid low on the earth.[49]      Sec. 2. _Not to see the Sun_      [Sacred persons not allowed to see the sun.]    The second rule to be here noted is that the sun may not shine upon the  divine person. This rule was observed both by the Mikado and by the  pontiff of the Zapotecs. The latter \"was looked upon as a god whom the  earth was not worthy to hold, nor the sun to shine upon.\"[50] The  Japanese would not allow that the Mikado should expose his sacred person  to the open air, and the sun was not thought worthy to shine on his  head.[51] The Indians of Granada, in South America, \"kept those who were  to be rulers or commanders, whether men or women, locked up for several  years when they were children, some of them seven years, and this so  close that they were not to see the sun, for if they should happen to  see it they forfeited their lordship, eating certain sorts of food  appointed; and those who were their keepers at certain times went into  their retreat or prison and scourged them severely.\"[52] Thus, for  example, the heir to the throne of Bogota, who was not the son but the  sister's son of the king, had to undergo a rigorous training from his  infancy: he lived in complete retirement in a temple, where he might not  see the sun nor eat salt nor converse with a woman: he was surrounded by  guards who observed his conduct and noted all his actions: if he broke a  single one of the rules laid down for him, he was deemed infamous and  forfeited all his rights to the throne.[53] So, too, the heir to the  kingdom of Sogamoso, before succeeding to the crown, had to fast for  seven years in the temple, being shut up in the dark and not allowed to  see the sun or light.[54] The prince who was to become Inca of Peru had  to fast for a month without seeing light.[55] On the day when a Brahman  student of the Veda took a bath, to signify that the time of his  studentship was at an end, he entered a cow-shed before sunrise, hung  over the door a skin with the hair inside, and sat there; on that day  the sun should not shine upon him.[56]    [Tabooed persons not allowed to see the sun; certain persons forbidden  to see fire.]    Again, women after childbirth and their offspring are more or less  tabooed all the world over; hence in Corea the rays of the sun are  rigidly excluded from both mother and child for a period of twenty-one  or a hundred days, according to their rank, after the birth has taken  place.[57] Among some of the tribes on the north-west coast of New  Guinea a woman may not leave the house for months after childbirth. When  she does go out, she must cover her head with a hood or mat; for if the  sun were to shine upon her, it is thought that one of her male relations  would die.[58] Again, mourners are everywhere taboo; accordingly in  mourning the Ainos of Japan wear peculiar caps in order that the sun may  not shine upon their heads.[59] During a solemn fast of three days the  Indians of Costa Rica eat no salt, speak as little as possible, light no  fires, and stay strictly indoors, or if they go out during the day they  carefully cover themselves from the light of the sun, believing that  exposure to the sun's rays would turn them black.[60] On Yule Night it  has been customary in parts of Sweden from time immemorial to go on  pilgrimage, whereby people learn many secret things and know what is to  happen in the coming year. As a preparation for this pilgrimage, \"some  secrete themselves for three days previously in a dark cellar, so as to  be shut out altogether from the light of heaven. Others retire at an  early hour of the preceding morning to some out-of-the-way place, such  as a hay-loft, where they bury themselves in the hay, that they may  neither see nor hear any living creature; and here they remain, in  silence and fasting, until after sundown; whilst there are those who  think it sufficient if they rigidly abstain from food on the day before  commencing their wanderings. During this period of probation a man ought  not to see fire, but should this have happened, he must strike a light  with flint and steel, whereby the evil that would otherwise have ensued  will be obviated.\"[61] During the sixteen days that a Pima Indian is  undergoing purification for killing an Apache he may not see a blazing  fire.[62]    [The story of Prince Sunless.]    Acarnanian peasants tell of a handsome prince called Sunless, who would  die if he saw the sun. So he lived in an underground palace on the site  of the ancient Oeniadae, but at night he came forth and crossed the  river to visit a famous enchantress who dwelt in a castle on the further  bank. She was loth to part with him every night long before the sun was  up, and as he turned a deaf ear to all her entreaties to linger, she hit  upon the device of cutting the throats of all the cocks in the  neighbourhood. So the prince, whose ear had learned to expect the shrill  clarion of the birds as the signal of the growing light, tarried too  long, and hardly had he reached the ford when the sun rose over the  Aetolian mountains, and its fatal beams fell on him before he could  regain his dark abode.[63]      Notes:    [1] _The Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings_, i. 44.
