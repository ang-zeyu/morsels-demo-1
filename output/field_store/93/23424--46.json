As each  faller in succession approaches close to the drawing rollers, it is  made to descend so that the pins may leave the fibres, and from this  point the faller moves backwards towards the retaining roller until  it reaches the other end ready to rise again in contact with the  fibres and to repeat the cycle as just described. It will thus be  seen that the upper set of fallers occupy the full stretch between  the retaining rollers and the drawing rollers, but there is always  one faller leaving the upper set at the front and another joining  the set at the back.    [Illustration: Fig. 17 Push-bar drawing frame]    The actual distance between the retaining rollers and the drawing  rollers is determined by the length of the fibre, and must in all  cases be a little greater than the longest fibre. This condition is  necessary because the surface speed of the drawing roller is much  greater than that of the retaining rollers; indeed, the difference  between the surface speeds of the two pairs of rollers is the actual  draft.    Between the retaining and drawing rollers the slivers are embedded  in the gill pins of the fallers, and these move forward, as mentioned,  to support the stretch of slivers and to carry the latter to the nip  of the drawing rollers. Immediately the forward ends of the fibres  are nipped between the quickly-moving drawing rollers, the fibres  affected slide on those which have not yet reached the drawing  rollers, and, incidentally, help to parallelize the fibres. It will  be clear that if any fibre happened to be in the grip of the two  pairs of rollers having different surface speeds, such fibre would be  snapped. It is to avoid this rupture of fibres that the distance  between the two sets of rollers is greater than the longest fibres  under treatment. The technical word for this distance is \"reach.\"    On emerging from the drawing rollers, the combed slivers pass  between slicking rollers, and then approach the sliver plate which  bridges the gap between the slicking rollers and the delivery rollers,  and by means of which plate two or more individual slivers are  diverted at right angles, first to join each other, and then again  diverted at right angles to join another sliver which passes  straight from the drawing rollers and over the sliver plate to the  guide of the delivery rollers. It will thus be seen that a number of  slivers, each having been drawn out according to the degree of draft,  are ultimately joined to pass through a common sliver guide or  conductor to the nip of the delivery rollers, and thence into a  sliver can.    The push-bar drawing illustrated in Fig. 17, or some other of the  same type, is often used as the first drawing frame in a set. With  the exception of the driving pulleys, all the gear wheels are at the  far end of the frame, and totally enclosed in dust-proof casing. The  set-on handles, for moving the belt from the loose pulley to the  fast pulley, or _vice versa_, are conveniently situated, as shown,  and in a place which is calculated to offer the least obstruction to  the operative. The machines are made with what are known as  \"two heads\" or \"three heads.\" It will be seen from the large  pressing rollers that there are two pairs; hence the machine is a  \"two-head\" drawing frame.    The slivers from the first drawing frame are now subjected to a  further process of doubling and drafting in a very similar machine  termed the second drawing frame. The pins in the gills for this  frame are rather finer and more closely set than those in the first  drawing frame, but otherwise the active parts of the machines, and  the operations conducted therein, are practically identical, and  therefore need no further description. It should be mentioned,  however, that there are different types of drawing frames, and their  designation is invariably due to the particular manner in which the  fallers are operated while traversing the closed circuit. The names  of other drawing frames appear below.      Spiral or screw gill;    Open link chain;    Rotary;    Ring Carrier    Circular.    For the preparation of slivers for some classes of yarn it is  considered desirable to extend the drawing and doubling operation in  a third drawing frame; as a rule, however, two frames are considered  sufficient for most classes of ordinary yarn.          CHAPTER IX.  THE ROVING FRAME    The process of doubling ends with the last drawing frame, but there  still remains a process by means of which the drafting of the  slivers and the parallelization of the fibres are continued. And, in  addition to these important functions, two other equally important  operations are conducted simultaneously, viz., that of imparting to  the drawn out sliver a slight twist to form what is known as a  \"rove\" or roving, and that of winding the rove on to a large rove  bobbin ready for the actual spinning frame.    The machine in which this multiple process is performed is termed a  \"roving frame.\" Such machines are made in various sizes, and with  different types of faller mechanism, but each machine is provided  for the manipulation of two rows of bobbins, and, of course, with  two rows of spindles and flyers. These two rows of spindles, flyers,  and rove bobbin supports are shown clearly in Fig. 18, which  represents a spiral roving frame made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser &  Sons, Ltd., Arbroath.    Each circular bobbin support is provided with pins rising from the  upper face of the disc, and these pins serve to enter holes in the  flange of the bobbin and thus to drive the bobbin. The discs or  bobbin supports are situated in holes in the \"lifter rail\" or  \"builder rail\" or simply the \"builder\"; the vertical spindles pass  through the centre of the discs, each spindle being provided with a  \"flyer,\" and finally a number of plates rest upon the tops of the  spindles.    [Illustration: FIG. 18 ROVING FRAME _By Permission of Messrs.  Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd_.]    A roving machine at work is shown in Fig. 19, and it will be seen  that the twisted sliver or rove on emerging from the drawing rollers  passes obliquely to the top of the spindle, through a guide eye,  then between the channel-shaped bend at the upper part of the flyer,  round the flyer arm, through an eye at the extreme end of either of  the flyer arms, and finally on to the bobbin. Each bobbin has its  own sliver can (occasionally two), and the sliver passes from this  can between the sides of the sliver guide, between the retaining  rollers, then amongst the gill pins of the fallers and between the  drawing (also the delivery) rollers. Here the sliver terminates  because the rotary action of the flyer imparts a little twist and  causes the material to assume a somewhat circular sectional form.  From this point, the path followed to the bobbin is that described  above.    As in all the preceding machines, the delivery speed of the sliver  is constant and is represented by the surface speed of the periphery  of the delivery rollers, this speed approximates to about 20 yards  per minute. The spindles and their flyers are also driven at a  constant speed, because in all cases we have--      spindle speed = delivery x twist.    There is thus a constant length of yarn to be wound on the rove  bobbin per minute, and the speed of the bobbin, which is driven  independently of the spindle and flyer, is constant for any one  series of rove coils on the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin differs,  however, for each complete layer of rove, simply because the  effective diameter of the material on the bobbin changes with the  beginning of each new layer.    The eyes of the flyers always rotate in the same horizontal plane,  and hence the rove always passes to the bobbins at the same height  from any fixed point. The bobbins, however, are raised gradually by  the builder during the formation of each layer from the top of the  bobbin to the bottom, and lowered gradually by the builder during  the formation of each layer from bottom to top. In other words, the  travel of the builder is represented by the distance between the  inner faces of the flanges of the rove bobbin.    [Illustration: FIG. 19 ROVING FRAME FAIRBAIRN'S ROVING FRAME IN WORK]    Since every complete layer of rove is wound on the bobbin in virtue  of the joint action of the spindle and flyer, the rotating bobbin,  and the builder, each complete traverse of the latter increases the  combined diameter of the rove and bobbin shaft by two diameters of  the rove. It is therefore necessary to impart an intermittent and  variable speed to the bobbin. The mechanism by means of which this  desirable and necessary speed is given to the bobbin constitutes one  of the most elegant groups of mechanical parts which obtains in  textile machinery. Some idea of the intricacy of the mechanism, as  well as its value and importance to the industry, may be gathered  from the fact that a considerable number of textile and mechanical  experts struggled with the problem for years; indeed 50 years  elapsed before an efficient and suitable group of mechanical parts  was evolved for performing the function.    The above group of mechanical parts is known as \"the differential  motion,\" and the difficulties in constructing its suitable gearing  arose from the fact that the speed of the rove passing on to the  various diameters must be maintained throughout, and must coincide  with the delivery of yarn from the rollers, so that the attenuated  but slightly twisted sliver can be wound on to the bobbin without  strain or stretch. The varying motion is regulated and obtained by a  drive, either from friction plates or from cones, and the whole gear  is interesting, instructive--and sometimes bewildering--two distinct  motions, a constant one and a variable one, are conveyed to the  bobbins from the driving shaft of the machine.    The machine illustrated in Fig. 18 is of special design, and the  whole train "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#8)"],[1,"Painting by Ludwig von Hofmann._]           *       *       *       *       *    TWILIGHT[36] (1825-26)      By the dim sea-shore    Lonely I sat, and thought-afflicted.    The sun sank low, and sinking he shed    Rose and vermilion upon the waters,    And the white foaming waves,    Urged on by the tide,    Foamed and murmured yet nearer and nearer--    A curious jumble of whispering and wailing,    A soft rippling laughter and sobbing and sighing,    And in between all a low lullaby singing.    Methought I heard ancient forgotten legends,    The world-old sweet stories,    Which once, as a boy,    I heard from my playmates,    When, of a summer's evening,    We crouched down to tell stories    On the stones of the doorstep,    With small listening hearts,    And bright curious eyes;    While the big grown-up girls    Were sitting opposite    At flowery and fragrant windows,    Their rosy faces    Smiling and moonshine-illumined.           *       *       *       *       *    HAIL TO THE SEA[37] (1825-26)      Thalatta! Thalatta!    Hail to thee, thou eternal sea!    Hail to thee, ten thousand times, hail!    With rejoicing heart    I bid thee welcome,    As once, long ago, did welcome thee    Ten thousand Greek hearts--    Hardship-battling, homesick-yearning,    World-renowned Greek hearts.      The billows surged,    They foamed and murmured,    The sun poured down, as in haste,    Flickering ripples of rosy light;    Long strings of frightened sea-gulls    Flutter away shrill screaming;    War-horses trample, and shields clash loudly,    And far resounds the triumphant cry:    Thalatta! Thalatta!      Hail to thee, thou eternal sea!    Like accents of home thy waters are whispering,    And dreams of childhood lustrous I see    Through thy limpid and crystalline wave,    Calling to mind the dear old memories    Of dear and delightful toys,    Of all the glittering Christmas presents,    Of all the red-branched forests of coral,    The pearls, the goldfish and bright-colored shells,    Which thou dost hide mysteriously    Deep down in thy clear house of crystal.      Oh, how have I languished in dreary exile!    Like unto a withered flower    In the botanist's capsule of tin,    My heart lay dead in my breast.    Methought I was prisoned a long sad winter,    A sick man kept in a darkened chamber;    And now I suddenly leave it,    And outside meets me the dazzling Spring,    Tenderly verdant and sun-awakened;    And rustling trees shed snowy petals,    And tender young flowers gaze on me    With their bright fragrant eyes,    And the air is full of laughter and gladness,    And rich with the breath of blossoms,    And in the blue sky the birds are singing--    Thalatta! Thalatta!      Oh, my brave Anabasis-heart!    How often, ah! how sadly often    Wast thou pressed hard by the North's fair Barbarians!    From large and conquering eyes    They shot forth burning arrows;    With crooked words as sharp as a rapier    They threatened to pierce my bosom;    With cuneiform angular missives they battered    My poor stunned brains;    In vain I held out my shield for protection,    The arrows hissed and the blows rained down,    And hard pressed I was pushed to the sea    By the North's fair Barbarians--    And, breathing freely, I greet the sea,    The sea my deliverer, the sea my friend--    Thalatta!

How sweet and homelike the world is reflected,    In the chalice green of Rhinewine Rummer.    And how the dancing microcosm    Sunnily glides down the thirsty throat!    Everything I behold in the glass--    History, old and new, of the nations,    Both Turks and Greeks, and Hegel and Gans,    Forests of citron and big reviews,    Berlin and Shilda, and Tunis and Hamburg;    But, above all, thy image, Beloved,    And thy dear little head on a gold-ground of Rhenish!      Oh, how fair, how fair art thou, Dearest!    Thou art as fair as the rose!    Not like the Rose of Shiras,    That bride of the nightingale, sung by Hafis,    Not like the Rose of Sharon,    That mystic red rose, exalted by prophets--    Thou art like the \"Rose, of the Bremen Town-Cellar,\"    Which is the Rose of Roses;    The older it grows the sweeter it blossoms,    And its breath divine it hath all entranced me,    It hath inspired and kindled my soul;    And had not the Town-Cellar Master gripped me    With firm grip and steady,    I should have stumbled!      That excellent man! We sat together    And drank like brothers;    We spoke of wonderful mystic things,    We sighed and sank in each other's arms,    And me to the faith of love he converted;    I drank to the health of my bitterest foes,    And I forgave all bad poets sincerely,    Even as I may one day be forgiven;      I wept with devotion, and at length    The doors of salvation were opened unto me,    Where the sacred Vats, the twelve Apostles,    Silently preach, yet oh, so plainly,    Unto all nations.      These be men forsooth!    Of humble exterior, in jackets of wood,    Yet within they are fairer and more enlightened    Than all the Temple's proud Levites,    Or the courtiers and followers of Herod,    Though decked out in gold and in purple;    Have I not constantly said:    Not with the herd of common low people,    But in the best and politest of circles    The King of Heaven was sure to dwell!      Hallelujah! How lovely the whisper    Of Bethel's palm-trees!    How fragrant the myrtle-trees of Hebron!    How sings the Jordan and reels with joy!    My immortal spirit likewise is reeling,    And I reel in company, and, joyously reeling,    Leads me upstairs and into the daylight    That excellent Town-Cellar Master of Bremen.      Thou excellent Town-Cellar Master of Bremen!    Dost see on the housetops the little angels    Sitting aloft, all tipsy and singing?    The burning sun up yonder    Is but a fiery and drunken nose--    The Universe Spirit's red nose;    And round the Universe Spirit's red nose    Reels the whole drunken world.           *       *       *       *       *    A NEW SPRING (1831)    1[39]      Soft and gently through my soul    Sweetest bells are ringing,    Speed you forth, my little song,    Of springtime blithely singing!      Speed you onward to a house    Where sweet flowers are fleeting!    If, perchance, a rose you see,    Say, I send her greeting!      2[40]      Thy deep blue eyes enchant me,    So lovingly they glow;    My gazing soul grows dreamy,    My words come strange and slow.      Thy deep blue eyes enchant me    Wherever I may go:    An ocean of azure fancies    O'erwhelms me with its flow.      3[41]      Was once an ancient monarch,    Heavy his heart, his locks were gray,    This poor and aged monarch    Took a wife so young and gay.      Was once a page-boy handsome,    With lightsome heart and curly hair,    The silken train he carried    Of the queen so young and fair.      Dost know the old, old story?    It sounds so sweet, so sad to tell--    Both were obliged to perish,    They loved each other too well.           *       *       *       *       *    ABROAD[42] (1834)      Oh I had once a beauteous Fatherland!    High used to seem    The oak--so high!--the violets nodded kind--    It was a dream.      In German I was kissed, in German told    (You scarce would deem    How sweetly rang the words): \"I love thee well!--\"    It was a dream.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SPHINX[43] (1839)      It is the fairy forest old,      With lime-tree blossoms scented!    The moonshine with its mystic light      My soul and sense enchanted.      On, on I roamed, and, as I went,      Sweet music o'er me rose there;    It is the nightingale--she sings      Of love and lovers' woes there.      She sings of love and lovers' woes,      Hearts blest, and hearts forsaken:    So sad is her mirth, so glad her sob,      Dreams long forgot awaken.      Still on I roamed, and, as I went,      I saw before me lowering    On a great wide lawn a stately pile,      With gables peaked and towering.      Closed were its windows, everywhere      A hush, a gloom, past telling;    It seemed as though silent Death within      These empty halls were dwelling.      A Sphinx lay there before the door,      Half-brutish and half-human,    A lioness in trunk and claws,      In head and breasts a woman.      A lovely woman! The pale cheek      Spoke of desires that wasted;    The hushed lips curved into a smile,      That wooed them to be tasted.      The nightingale so sweetly sang,      I yielded to their wooing;    And as I kissed that winning face,      I sealed my own undoing.      The marble image thrilled with life,      The stone began to quiver;    She drank my kisses' burning flame      With fierce convulsive shiver.      She almost drank my breath away;      And, to her passion bending,    She clasped me close, with her lion claws      My hapless body rending.      Delicious torture, rapturous pang!      The pain, the bliss, unbounded!    Her lips, their kiss was heaven to me,      Her claws, oh, how they wounded.      The nightingale sang: \"O beauteous Sphinx!      O love, love! say, why this is,    That with the anguish of death itself      Thou minglest all thy blisses?      \"Oh beauteous Sphinx, oh, answer me,      That riddle strange unloosing!    For many, many thousand years      Have I on it been musing!\"      GERMANY[44] (1842)      Germany's still a little child,      But he's nursed by the sun, though tender;    He is not suckled on soothing milk,      But on flames of burning splendor.      One grows apace on such a diet;      It fires the blood from languor.    Ye neighbors' children,"]]]
