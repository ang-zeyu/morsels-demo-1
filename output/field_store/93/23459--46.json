He  had, when taken up and carried before Col. Ellis, been committed to New  Prison for a capital offence. He had not remained there long before he  wrote the Colonel a letter in which (provided he were admitted an  evidence) he offered to make large discoveries. His offers were  accepted, and several convicted capitally at the Old Bailey by him were  executed at Tyburn, whither for his trade of housebreaking, Shepherd  quickly followed them.    While in Newgate Shepherd had picked up a thoughtless resolution as to  dying, not uncommon to those malefactors who, having been often  condemned, go at last hardened to the gallows. When he was exhorted to  think seriously of making his peace with God, he replied 'twas done and  he was sure of going to Heaven.    With these were executed Thomas Charnock, a young man well and  religiously educated. By his friends he had been placed in the house of  a very eminent trader, and being seduced by ill-company yielded to the  desire of making a show in the world. In order to do so, he robbed his  master's counting-house, which fact made him indeed conspicuous, but in  a very different manner from what he had flattered himself with. They  died tolerably submissive and penitent, this last malefactor,  especially, having rational ideas of religion.    FOOTNOTES:        [4] William Davis, the Golden Farmer, was a notorious          highwayman, who obtained his sobriquet from a habit of always          paying in gold. He was hanged in Fleet Street, December 20,          1689. His adventures are told at length in Smith's _History of          the Highwaymen_, edited by me and published in the same series          as this volume.          The Life of WILLIAM BARTON, a Highwayman      This William Barton was born in Thames Street, London, and seemed to  have inherited a sort of hereditary wildness and inconstancy, his father  having been always of a restless temper and addicted to every species of  wickedness, except such as are punished by temporal laws. While this son  William was a child, he left him, without any provision, to the care of  his mother, and accompanied by a concubine whom he had long convened  with, shipped himself for the island of Jamaica, carrying with him a  good quantity of goods proper for that climate, intending to live there  as pleasantly as the place would give him leave. His head being well  turned, both for trading and planting, it was, indeed, probable enough  he should succeed.    Now, no sooner was his father gone on this unaccountable voyage, but  William was taken home and into favour by his grandfather, who kept a  great eating-house in Covent Garden. Here Will, if he would, might  certainly have done well. His grandfather bound him to himself, treated  him with the utmost tenderness and indulgence, and the gentlemen who  frequented the house were continually making him little presents, which  by their number were considerable, and might have contented a youth like  him.    But William, whose imagination was full of roving as his father's, far  from sitting down pleased and satisfied with that easy condition into  which Fortune had thrown him, began to dream of nothing but travels and  adventures. In short, in spite of all the poor old man, his grandfather,  could say to prevent it, to sea he went, and to Jamaica in quest of his  father, who he fancied must have grown extravagantly rich by this time,  the common sentiments of fools, who think none poor who have the good  luck to dwell in the West Indies.    On Barton's arrival at Jamaica he found all things in a very different  condition from what he had flattered himself with. His father was dead  and the woman who went over with him settled in a good plantation, 'tis  true, but so settled that Will was unable to remove her; so he betook  himself to sea again, and rubbed on the best way he was able. But as if  the vengeance of Heaven had pursued him, or rather as if Providence, by  punishments, designed to make him lay aside his vices, Barton had no  sooner scraped a little money together, but the vessel in which he  sailed was (under the usual pretence of contraband goods) seized by the  Spaniards, who not long after they were taken, sent the men they made  prisoners into Spain. The natural moroseness of those people's temper,  makes them harsh masters. Poor Barton found it so, and with the rest of  his unfortunate companions, suffered all the inconveniences of hard  usage and low diet, though as they drew nearer the coast of Spain that  severity was a little softened.    When they were safely landed, they were hurried to a prison where it was  difficult to determine which was worst, their treatment or their food.  Above all the rest Barton was uneasy, and his head ever turned towards  contriving an escape. When he and some other intriguing heads had  meditated long in vain, an accident put it in their power to do that  with ease which all their prudence could not render probable in the  attempt, a thing common with men under misfortune, who have reason,  therefore, never to part with hope.    Finding an old wall in the outer court of the prison weak, and ready to  fall down, the keeper caused the English prisoners, amongst others, to  be sent to repair it. The work was exceedingly laborious, but Barton and  one of his companions soon thought of a way to ease it. They had no  sooner broke up a small part of the foundation which was to be new laid,  but stealing the Spanish soldiers' pouches, they crowded the powder into  a small bag, placing it underneath as far as they could reach, and then  gave it fire. This threw up two yards of the wall, and while the  Spaniards stood amazed at the report, Barton and his associates marched  off through the breach, without finding the slightest resistance from  any of the keeper's people, though he had another party in the street.    But this would have signified very little, if Providence had not also  directed them to a place of safety by bringing them as soon as they  broke out of the door to a monastery. Thither they fled for shelter, and  the religious of the place treated them with much humanity. They  succoured them with all necessary provision, protected them when  reclaimed by the gaoler, and taking them into their service, showed them  in all respects the same care and favour they did to the rest of their  domestics.    Yet honest labour, however recompensed, was grating to these restless  people, who longed for nothing but debauchery, and struggled for liberty  only as a preparative to the indulging of their vices; and so they began  to contrive how they should free themselves from hence. Barton and his  fellow engineer were not long before they fell on a method to effect it,  by wrenching open the outer doors in the night, and getting to an  English vessel that lay in the harbour ready to sail.    They had not been aboard long ere they found that the charitable friars  had agreed with the captain for their passage, and so all they gained by  breaking out was the danger of being reclaimed, or at least going naked  and without any assistance, which to be sure they would have met with  from their masters, if they could but have had a little patience. But  the passion of returning home, or rather a vehement lust after the  basest pleasures, hurried them to whatever appeared conducive to that  end, however fatal in its consequence it might be.    When they were got safe into their native country again, each took such  a course for a livelihood as he liked best. Whether Barton then fell  into thievery, or whether he learned not that mystery before he had  served an apprenticeship thereto in the Army I cannot say, but in some  short space after his being at home 'tis certain that he listed himself  a soldier, and served several campaigns in Flanders, during the last  War. Being a very gallant fellow, he gained the love of his officers,  and there was great probability of his doing well there, having gained  at least some principle of honour in the service, which would have  prevented him doing such base things as those for which he afterwards  died. But, unhappily for him, the War ended just as he was on the point  of becoming paymaster-sergeant, and his regiment being disbanded, poor  Will became broke in every acceptation of the word. He retained always a  strong tincture of his military education, and was peculiarly fond of  telling such adventures as he gained the knowledge of, while in the  Army.    Amongst other stories that he told were one or two which may appear  perhaps not unentertaining to my readers. When Brussels came towards the  latter end of the War to be pretty well settled under the Imperialists,  abundance of persons of distinction came to reside there and in the  neighborhood from the advantage natural to so fine a situation. Amongst  these was the Baron De Casteja, a nobleman of a Spanish family, who  except for his being addicted excessively to gaming, was in every way a  fine gentlemen. He had married a lady of one of the best families in  Flanders, by whom he had a son of the greatest hopes. The baron's  passion for play had so far lessened their fortune that they lived but  obscurely at a village three leagues from Brussels, where having now  nothing to support his gaming expenses, he grew reformed, and his  behaviour gained so high and general esteem that the most potent lord in  the country met not with higher reverence on any occasion. The great  prudence and economy of the baroness made her the theme of general  praise, while the young Chevalier de Casteja did not a little add to the  honours of the family.    It happened the baron had a younger brother in the Emperor's service,  whose merit having raised him to a considerable rank in his armies, he  had acquired a very considerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#8)"],[1,"pherds, eating and making merry, who took pity  on him and made him welcome. And when he had broken his fast and warmed  himself, he told them the mishap that had befallen him, and how it was  that he was come there alone, and asked them if there was a farm or  castle in those parts, whither he might betake him. The shepherds said  that about three miles away there was a castle belonging to Liello di  Campo di Fiore, where his lady was then tarrying. Pietro, much comforted,  requested to be guided thither by some of their company; whereupon two of  them right gladly escorted him. So Pietro arrived at the castle, where he  found some that knew him; and while he was endeavouring to set on foot a  search for the damsel in the forest, the lady summoned him to her  presence, and he, forthwith obeying, and seeing Agnolella with her, was  the happiest man that ever was. He yearned till he all but swooned to go  and embrace her, but refrained, for bashfulness, in the lady's presence.  And overjoyed as he was, the joy of the damsel was no less. The lady  received him with great cheer, and though, when she had heard the story  of his adventures from his own lips, she chid him not a little for having  set at nought the wishes of his kinsfolk; yet, seeing that he was still  of the same mind, and that the damsel was also constant, she said to  herself:--To what purpose give I myself all this trouble? they love one  another, they know one another; they love with equal ardour; their love  is honourable, and I doubt not is well pleasing to God, seeing that the  one has escaped the gallows and the other the lance, and both the wild  beasts: wherefore be it as they would have it. Then, turning to them, she  said:--\"If 'tis your will to be joined in wedlock as man and wife, mine  jumps with it: here shall your nuptials be solemnized and at Liello's  charges, and for the rest I will see that your peace is made with your  kinsfolk.\" So in the castle the pair were wedded, Pietro only less blithe  than Agnolella, the lady ordering the nuptials as honourably as might be  in her mountain-home, and there they had most sweet joyance of the first  fruits of their love. So some days they tarried there, and then  accompanied by the lady with a strong escort, they took horse and  returned to Rome, where, very wroth though she found Pietro's kinsfolk  for what he had done, the lady re-established solid peace between him and  them; and so at Rome Pietro and Agnolella lived together to a good old  age in great tranquillity and happiness.

NOVEL IV.    --  Ricciardo Manardi is found by Messer Lizio da Valbona with his daughter,  whom he marries, and remains at peace with her father.  --    In silence Elisa received the praise bestowed on her story by her fair  companions; and then the queen called for a story from Filostrato, who  with a laugh began on this wise:--Chidden have I been so often and by so  many of you for the sore burden, which I laid upon you, of discourse  harsh and meet for tears, that, as some compensation for such annoy, I  deem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a  little: wherefore my story, which will be of the briefest, shall be of a  love, the course whereof, save for sighs and a brief passage of fear  mingled with shame, ran smooth to a happy consummation.    Know then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt in  Romagna a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da Valbona by  name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it happened, there  was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina, a daughter, who, as she  grew up, became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those  parts, and, for that she was the only daughter left to them, was most  dearly loved and cherished by her father and mother, who guarded her with  most jealous care, thinking to arrange some great match for her. Now  there was frequently in Messer Lizio's house, and much in his company, a  fine, lusty young man, one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom  Messer Lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as  if he had been their own son: who, now and again taking note of the  damsel, that she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour  most commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with  her, which love he was very careful to conceal. The damsel detected it,  however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him, to  Ricciardo's no small satisfaction. Again and again he was on the point of  speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length, however, he summoned  up his courage, and seizing his opportunity, thus addressed  her:--\"Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to die for love of thee.\"  Whereto the damsel forthwith responded:--\"Nay, God grant that it be not  rather that I die for love of thee.\" Greatly exhilarated and encouraged,  Ricciardo made answer:--\"'Twill never be by default of mine that thou  lackest aught that may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the  means to save thy life and mine.\" Then said the damsel:--\"Thou seest,  Ricciardo, how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere  possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may do  without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it.\" Ricciardo was  silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he  said:--\"Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see, to wit,  that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to  the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew that thou  wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive to meet thee,  albeit 'tis very high.\" \"As for my sleeping there,\" replied Caterina, \"I  doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art sure that thou canst join  me.\" Ricciardo answered in the affirmative. Whereupon they exchanged a  furtive kiss, and parted.    On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the damsel began  complaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had  not been able to get any sleep during the night. \"Daughter,\" said the  lady, \"what heat was there? Nay, there was no heat at all.\" \"Had you  said, 'to my thinking,' mother,\" rejoined Caterina, \"you would perhaps  have said sooth; but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have  in them than ladies that are advanced in years.\" \"True, my daughter,\"  returned the lady, \"but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold, as  thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we find it, and  as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be cooler, and thou  wilt sleep better.\" \"God grant it be so,\" said Caterina, \"but 'tis not  wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on.\" \"What  then,\" said the lady, \"wouldst thou have me do?\" \"With your leave and my  father's,\" answered Caterina, \"I should like to have a little bed made up  on the terrace by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the  nightingales sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much  better than in your room.\" Whereupon:--\"Daughter, be of good cheer,\" said  the mother; \"I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he shall  decide.\" So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between her and  the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason a little  morose, said:--\"What nightingale is this, to whose chant she would fain  sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep.\"  Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her such offence, that for  anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she not only slept not herself  that night, but suffered not her mother to sleep, keeping up a perpetual  complaint of the great heat. Wherefore her mother hied her in the morning  to Messer Lizio, and said to him:--\"Sir, you hold your daughter none too  dear; what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She  has tossed about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can  you wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale  sing? Young folk naturally affect their likes.\" Whereto Messer Lizio made  answer:--\"Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set a curtain  round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale sing to her  heart's content.\" Which the damsel no sooner learned, than she had a bed  made there with intent to sleep there that same night; wherefore she  watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a concerted sign she gave to  understand what he was to do. Messer Lizio, as soon as he had heard the  damsel go to bed, locked a door that led from his room to the terrace,  and went to sleep himself. When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of  a ladder got upon a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain  toothings of another wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had  he fallen, clambered up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him  quietly with the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then  got them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and  joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few times.  But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards dawn, albeit  they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm encircling  Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him by that part of  his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most averse to name in the  company of men. So, peacefully they slept, and were still asleep when day  broke and Messer Lizio rose; and calling to mind that his daughter slept  on the terrace, softly opened the door, saying to himself:--Let me see  what sort of night's rest the nightingale has afforded our Caterina? And  having entered, he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and  saw"]]]
