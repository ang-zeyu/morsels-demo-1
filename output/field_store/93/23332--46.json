He turned his horse, and made a show of flying in despair.  Orlando dashed after him, as he desired; and Agrican fled till he reached  a green place in a wood, with a fountain in it.    The place was beautiful, and the Tartar dismounted to refresh himself at  the fountain, but without taking off his helmet, or laying aside any of  his armour. Orlando was quickly at his back, crying out, \"So bold, and  yet such a fugitive! How could you fly from a single arm, and yet think  to escape? When a man can die with honour, he should be glad to die; for  he may live and fare worse. He may get death and infamy together.\"    The Tartar king had leaped on his saddle the moment he saw his enemy; and  when the Paladin had done speaking, he said in a mild voice, \"Without  doubt you are the best knight I ever encountered; and fain would I leave  you untouched for your own sake, if you would cease to hinder me from  rallying my people. I pretended to fly, in order to bring you out of the  field. If you insist upon fighting, I must needs fight and slay you; but  I call the sun in the heavens to witness, that I would rather not. I  should be very sorry for your death.\"    The County Orlando felt pity for so much gallantry; and he said,\" The  nobler you shew yourself, the more it grieves me to think, that in dying  without a knowledge of the true faith, you will be lost in the other  world. Let me advise you to save body and soul at once. Receive baptism,  and go your way in peace.\"    Agrican looked him in the face, and replied, \"I suspect you to be the  Paladin Orlando. If you are, I would not lose this opportunity of  fighting with you, to be king of Paradise. Talk to me no more about your  things of the other world; for you will preach in vain. Each of us for  himself, and let the sword be umpire.\"    No sooner said than done. The Tartar drew his sword, boldly advancing  upon Orlando; and a cut and thrust fight began, so long and so terrible,  each warrior being a miracle of prowess, that the story says it lasted  from noon till night. Orlando then, seeing the stars come out, was the  first to propose a respite. \"What are we to do,\" said he, \"now that  daylight has left us?\"    Agrican answered readily enough, \"Let us repose in this meadow, and renew  the combat at dawn.\"    The repose was taken accordingly. Each tied up his horse, and reclined  himself on the grass, not far from one another, just as if they had been  friends,--Orlando by the fountain, Agrican beneath a pine. It was a  beautiful clear night; and as they talked together, before addressing  themselves to sleep, the champion of Christendom, looking up at the  firmament, said, \"That is a fine piece of workmanship, that starry  spectacle. God made it all,--that moon of silver, and those stars of  gold, and the light of day and the sun,--all for the sake of human kind.\"    \"You wish, I see, to talk of matters of faith,\" said the Tartar. \"Now  I may as well tell you at once, that I have no sort of skill in such  matters, nor learning of any kind. I never could learn anything when  I was a boy. I hated it so, that I broke the man's head who was  commissioned to teach me; and it produced such an effect on others, that  nobody ever afterwards dared so much as shew me a book. My boyhood was  therefore passed as it should be, in horsemanship, and hunting, and  learning to fight. What is the good of a gentleman's poring all day over  a book? Prowess to the knight, and prattle to the clergyman. That is my  motto.\"    \"I acknowledge,\" returned Orlando, \"that arms are the first consideration  of a gentleman; but not at all that he does himself dishonour by  knowledge. On the contrary, knowledge is as great an embellishment of the  rest of his attainments, as the flowers are to the meadow before us; and  as to the knowledge of his Maker, the man that is without it is no better  than a stock or a stone, or a brute beast. Neither, without study, can  he reach anything like a due sense of the depth and divineness of the  contemplation.\"    \"Learned or not learned,\" said Agrican, \"you might skew yourself better  bred than by endeavouring to make me talk on a subject on which you have  me at a disadvantage. I have frankly told you what sort of person I am;  and I dare say, that you for your part are very learned and wise. You  will therefore permit me, if you say anything more of such things, to  make you no answer. If you choose to sleep, I wish you good night; but  if you prefer talking, I recommend you to talk of fighting, or of fair  ladies. And, by the way, pray tell me-are you, or are you not, may I ask,  that Orlando who makes such a noise in the world? And what is it, pray,  brings you into these parts? Were you ever in love? I suppose you must  have been; for to be a knight, and never to have been in love, would be  like being a man with no heart in his breast.\"    The County replied, \"Orlando I am, and in love I am.[2] Love has made me  abandon every thing, and brought me into these distant regions; and to  tell you all in one word, my heart is in the hands of the daughter of  King Galafron. You have come against him with fire and sword, to get  possession of his castles and his dominions; and I have come to help  him, for no object in the world but to please his daughter, and win her  beautiful hand. I care for nothing else in existence.\"    Now when the Tartar king Agrican heard his antagonist speak in this  manner, and knew him to be indeed Orlando, and to be in love with  Angelica, his face changed colour for grief and jealousy, though it could  not be seen for the darkness. His heart began beating with such violence,  that he felt as if he should have died. \"Well,\" said he to Orlando, \"we  are to fight when it is daylight, and one or the other is to be left  here, dead on the ground. I have a proposal to make to you; nay, an  entreaty. My love is so excessive for the same lady, that I beg you to  leave her to me. I will owe you my thanks, and give up the fight myself.  I cannot bear that any one else should love her, and I live to see it.  Why, therefore, should either of us perish? Give her up. Not a soul shall  know it.\"[3]    \"I never yet,\" answered Orlando, \"made a promise which I did not keep;  and, nevertheless, I own to you, that were I to make a promise like that,  and even swear to keep it, I should not. You might as well ask me to tear  away the limbs from my body, and the eyes out of my head. I could as soon  live without breath itself, as cease loving Angelica.\"    Agrican bad scarcely patience enough to let the speaker finish, ere he  leaped furiously on horseback, though it was midnight. \"Quit her,\" said  he, \"or die!\"    Orlando, seeing the infidel getting up, and not being sure that he would  not add treachery to fierceness, had been hardly less quick in mounting  for the combat. \"Never!\" exclaimed he. \"I never could have quitted her if  I would; and now I wouldn't if I could. You must seek her by other  means than these.\"    Fiercely dashed their horses together, in the night-time, on the green  mead. Despiteful and terrible were the blows they gave and took by the  moonlight. There was no need of their looking out for one another,  night-time though it was. Their business was to take as sharp heed of  every movement, as if it had been noon-day.[4]    Agrican fought in a rage: Orlando was cooler. And now the struggle had  lasted more than five hours, and dawn began to be visible, when the  Tartar king, furious to find so much trouble given him, dealt his enemy a  blow sharp and violent beyond conception. It cut the shield in two, as  if it had been a cheesecake; and though blood could not be drawn from  Orlando, because he was fated, it shook and bruised him, as if it had  started every joint in his body.    His body only, however; not a particle of his soul. So dreadful was the  blow which the Paladin gave in return, that not only shield, but every  bit of mail on the body of Agrican, was broken in pieces, and three of  his left ribs cut asunder.    The Tartar, roaring like a lion, raised his sword with still greater  vehemence than before, and dealt a blow on the Paladin's helmet, such as  he had never yet received from mortal man. For a moment it took away his  senses. His sight failed; his ears tinkled; his frightened horse turned  about to fly; and he was falling from the saddle, when the very action  of falling jerked his head upwards, and with the jerk he regained his  recollection.    \"O my God!\" thought he, \"what a shame is this! how shall I ever again  dare to face Angelica! I have been fighting, hour after hour, with this  man, and he is but one, and I call myself Orlando. If the combat last  any longer, I will bury myself in a monastery, and never look on sword  again.\"    Orlando muttered with his lips closed and his teeth ground together; and  you might have thought that fire instead of breath came out of his nose  and mouth. He raised his sword Durindana with both his hands, and sent  it down so tremendously on Agrican's left shoulder, that it cut through  breast-plate and belly-piece down to the very haunch; nay, crushed the  saddle-bow, though it was made of bone and iron, and felled man and horse  to the earth. From shoulder to hip was Agrican cut through his weary  soul, and he turned as white as ashes, and felt death upon him. He called  Orlando to come close to him with a gentle voice, and said, as well as he  could, \"I believe in Him who died on the Cross. Baptise me, I pray thee,  with the fountain, before my senses are gone. I have lived an evil life,  but need not be rebellious to God in death also. May He who came to save  all the rest of the world, save me! He is a God of great mercy.\"    And he shed tears, did that king, though he had been so lofty and fierce.    Orlando dismounted quickly, with his own face in tears. He gathered the  king tenderly in his arms, and took and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#8)"],[1,"our men in the rear.    XXIV.--Caesar, when he observes this, draws off his forces to the next  hill, and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy. He  himself, meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of  his four veteran legions in such a manner that he placed above him on  the very summit the two legions which he had lately levied in Hither  Gaul, and all the auxiliaries; and he ordered that the whole mountain  should be covered with men, and that meanwhile the baggage should be  brought together into one place, and the position be protected by those  who were posted in the upper line. The Helvetii, having followed with  all their waggons, collected their baggage into one place: they  themselves, after having repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx,  advanced up to our front line in very close order.    XXV.--Caesar, having removed out of sight first his own horse, then  those of all, that he might make the danger of all equal, and do away  with the hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined battle. His  soldiers, hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily broke  the enemy's phalanx. That being dispersed, they made a charge on them  with drawn swords. It was a great hindrance to the Gauls in fighting,  that, when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the  (Roman) javelins pierced through and pinned fast together, as the point  of the iron had bent itself, they could neither pluck it out, nor, with  their left hand entangled, fight with sufficient ease; so that many,  after having long tossed their arm about, chose rather to cast away the  buckler from their hand, and to fight with their person unprotected. At  length, worn out with wounds, they began to give way, and as there was  in the neighbourhood a mountain about a mile off, to betake themselves  thither. When the mountain had been gained, and our men were advancing  up, the Boii and Tulingi, who with about 15,000 men closed the enemy's  line of march and served as a guard to their rear, having assailed our  men on the exposed flank as they advanced [prepared] to surround them;  upon seeing which, the Helvetii, who had betaken themselves to the  mountain, began to press on again and renew the battle. The Romans  having faced about, advanced to the attack in two divisions; the first  and second line to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off  the field; the third to receive those who were just arriving.    XXVI.--Thus was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful  success. When they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men, the  one division, as they had begun to do, betook themselves to the  mountain; the other repaired to their baggage and waggons. For during  the whole of this battle, although the fight lasted from the seventh  hour [_i.e._ 12 (noon)--1 P.M.] to eventide, no one could see an enemy  with his back turned. The fight was carried on also at the baggage till  late in the night, for they had set waggons in the way as a rampart, and  from the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men, as they came  on, and some from between the waggons and the wheels kept darting their  lances and javelins from beneath, and wounding our men. After the fight  had lasted some time, our men gained possession of their baggage and  camp. There the daughter and one of the sons of Orgetorix were taken.  After that battle about 130,000 men [of the enemy] remained alive, who  marched incessantly during the whole of that night; and after a march  discontinued for no part of the night, arrived in the territories of the  Lingones on the fourth day, whilst our men, having stopped for three  days, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of  the slain, had not been able to follow them. Caesar sent letters and  messengers to the Lingones [with orders] that they should not assist  them with corn or with anything else; for that if they should assist  them, he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii. After the  three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his  forces.    XXVII.--The Helvetii, compelled by the want of everything, sent  ambassadors to him about a surrender. When these had met him in the way  and had thrown themselves at his feet, and speaking in suppliant tone  had with tears sued for peace, and [when] he had ordered them to await  his arrival, in the place where they then were, they obeyed his  commands. When Caesar arrived at that place, he demanded hostages, their  arms, and the slaves who had deserted to them. Whilst those things are  being sought for and got together, after a night's interval, about 6000  men of that canton which is called the Verbigene, whether terrified by  fear, lest, after delivering up their arms, they should suffer  punishment, or else induced by the hope of safety, because they supposed  that, amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered themselves,  _their_ flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked, having  at night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii, hastened to the  Rhine and the territories of the Germans.    XXVIII.--But when Caesar discovered this, he commanded those through  whose territories they had gone, to seek them, out and to bring them  back again, if they meant to be acquitted before him; and considered  them, when brought back, in the light of enemies; he admitted all the  rest to a surrender, upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and  deserters. He ordered the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi to  return to their territories from which they had come, and as there was  at home nothing whereby they might support their hunger, all the  productions of the earth having been destroyed, he commanded the  Allobroges to let them have a plentiful supply of corn; and ordered them  to rebuild the towns and villages which they had burnt. This he did,  chiefly on this account, because he was unwilling that the country, from  which the Helvetii had departed, should be untenanted, lest the Germans,  who dwell on the other side of the Rhine, should, on account of the  excellence of the lands, cross over from their own territories into  those of the Helvetii, and become borderers upon the province of Gaul  and the Allobroges. He granted the petition of the Aedui, that they  might settle the Boii, in their own (_i.e._ in the Aeduan) territories,  as these were known to be of distinguished valour to whom they gave  lands, and whom they afterwards admitted to the same state of rights and  freedom as themselves.    XXIX.--In the camp of the Helvetii, lists were found, drawn up in Greek  characters, and were brought to Caesar, in which an estimate had been  drawn up, name by name, of the number which had gone forth from their  country of those who were able to bear arms; and likewise the boys, the  old men, and the women, separately. Of all which items the total was:-    Of the _Helvetii_ [lit. of the heads of the Helvetii] 263,000  Of the _Tulingi_                                       36,000  Of the _Latobrigi_                                     14,000  Of the _Rauraci_                                       23,000  Of the _Boii_                                          32,000                                                        -------  The sum of all amounted to                            368,000    Out of these, such as could bear arms [amounted] to about 92,000. When  the _census_ of those who returned home was taken, as Caesar had  commanded, the number was found to be 110,000.    XXX.--When the war with the Helvetii was concluded, ambassadors from  almost all parts of Gaul, the chiefs of states, assembled to  congratulate Caesar, [saying] that they were well aware, that, although  he had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war, for the old wrongs done  by them to the Roman people, yet that circumstance had happened no less  to the benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people, because the  Helvetii, while their affairs were most flourishing, had quitted their  country with the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul, and  seizing the government of it, and selecting, out of a great abundance,  that spot for an abode which they should judge to be the most convenient  and most productive of all Gaul, and hold the rest of the states as  tributaries. They requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an  assembly of the whole of Gaul for a particular day, and to do that with  Caesar's permission, [stating] that they had some things which, with the  general consent, they wished to ask of him. This request having been  granted, they appointed a day for the assembly, and ordained by an oath  with each other, that no one should disclose [their deliberations]  except those to whom this [office] should be assigned by the general  assembly.    XXXI.--When that assembly was dismissed, the same chiefs of states, who  had before been to Caesar, returned, and asked that they might be  allowed to treat with him privately (in secret) concerning the safety of  themselves and of all. That request having been obtained, they all threw  themselves in tears at Caesar's feet, [saying] that they no less begged  and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed  than that they might obtain those things which they wished for; inasmuch  as they saw that, if a disclosure were made, they should be put to the  greatest tortures. For these Divitiacus the Aeduan spoke and told him:--  \"That there were two parties in the whole of Gaul: that the Aedui stood  at the head of one of these, the Arverni of the other. After these had  been violently struggling with one another for the superiority for many  years, it came to pass that the Germans were called in for hire by the  Arverni and the Sequani. That about 15,000 of them [_i.e._ of the  Germans] had at first crossed the Rhine: but after that these wild and  savage men had"]]]
