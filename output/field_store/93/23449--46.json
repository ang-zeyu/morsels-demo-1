At this stage the time was not ripe enough for them to  accord a consistent and well-defined existence to the multitude  of gods nor to universalize them in a monotheistic creed. They  hypostatized unconsciously any force of nature that overawed  them or filled them with gratefulness and joy by its beneficent or  aesthetic character, and adored it. The deity which moved the devotion  or admiration of their mind was the most supreme for the  time. This peculiar trait of the Vedic hymns Max Muller has called  Henotheism or Kathenotheism: \"a belief in single gods, each in turn  standing out as the highest. And since the gods are thought of  as specially ruling in their own spheres, the singers, in their special  concerns and desires, call most of all on that god to whom they  ascribe the most power in the matter,--to whose department if I  may say so, their wish belongs. This god alone is present to the mind  of the suppliant; with him for the time being is associated everything  that can be said of a divine being;--he is the highest, the only  god, before whom all others disappear, there being in this, however,  no offence or depreciation of any other god [Footnote ref 1].\" \"Against  this theory it has been urged,\" as Macdonell rightly says in his _Vedic  Mythology_ [Footnote ref 2], \"that Vedic deities are not represented as  'independent of all the rest,' since no religion brings its gods into  more frequent and varied juxtaposition and combination, and that even  the mightiest gods of the Veda are made dependent on others. Thus  Varu@na and Surya are subordinate to Indra (I. 101), Varu@na and  the As'vins submit to the power of Vi@s@nu (I. 156)....Even when a  god is spoken of as unique or chief (_eka_), as is natural enough in  laudations, such statements lose their temporarily monotheistic  force, through the modifications or corrections supplied by the context  or even by the same verse [Footnote Ref 3]. \"Henotheism is therefore an  appearance,\" says Macdonell, \"rather than a reality, an appearance  produced by the indefiniteness due to undeveloped anthropomorphism,  by the lack of any Vedic god occupying the position of a Zeus as the  constant head of the pantheon, by the natural tendency of the priest  or singer in extolling a particular god to exaggerate his greatness  and to ignore other gods, and by the    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 27.]    [Footnote 2: See _Ibid._ p. 33. See also Arrowsmith's note on it for other  references to Henotheism.]    [Footnote 3: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, pp. 16, 17.]    19    growing belief in the unity of the gods (cf. the refrain of 3, 35)  each of whom might be regarded as a type of the divine [Footnote ref 1].\"  But whether we call it Henotheism or the mere temporary exaggeration  of the powers of the deity in question, it is evident that this  stage can neither be properly called polytheistic nor monotheistic,  but one which had a tendency towards them both, although it  was not sufficiently developed to be identified with either of them.  The tendency towards extreme exaggeration could be called a  monotheistic bias in germ, whereas the correlation of different  deities as independent of one another and yet existing side by side  was a tendency towards polytheism.    Growth of a Monotheistic tendency; Prajapati, Vis'vakarma.    This tendency towards extolling a god as the greatest and  highest gradually brought forth the conception of a supreme  Lord of all beings (Prajapati), not by a process of conscious  generalization but as a necessary stage of development of the mind,  able to imagine a deity as the repository of the highest moral and  physical power, though its direct manifestation cannot be perceived.  Thus the epithet Prajapati or the Lord of beings, which  was originally an epithet for other deities, came to be recognized  as a separate deity, the highest and the greatest. Thus it is said  in R.V.x. 121 [Footnote Ref 2]:      In the beginning rose Hira@nyagarbha,    Born as the only lord of all existence.    This earth he settled firm and heaven established:    What god shall we adore with our oblations?    Who gives us breath, who gives us strength, whose bidding    All creatures must obey, the bright gods even;    Whose shade is death, whose shadow life immortal:    What god shall we adore with our oblations?    Who by his might alone became the monarch    Of all that breathes, of all that wakes or slumbers,    Of all, both man and beast, the lord eternal:    What god shall we adore with our oblations?    Whose might and majesty these snowy mountains,    The ocean and the distant stream exhibit;    Whose arms extended are these spreading regions:    What god shall we adore with our oblations?    Who made the heavens bright, the earth enduring,    Who fixed the firmament, the heaven of heavens;    Who measured out the air's extended spaces:    What god shall we adore with our oblations?    _________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 17.]    [Footnote 2: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, pp. 88, 89.]    20    Similar attributes are also ascribed to the deity Vis'vakarma  (All-creator) [Footnote ref 1]. He is said to be father and procreator of  all beings, though himself uncreated. He generated the primitive waters.  It is to him that the sage says,      Who is our father, our creator, maker,    Who every place doth know and every creature,    By whom alone to gods their names were given,    To him all other creatures go to ask him [Footnote ref 2]                                            R.V.x.82.3.      Brahma.    The conception of Brahman which has been the highest glory  for the Vedanta philosophy of later days had hardly emerged in  the @Rg-Veda from the associations of the sacrificial mind. The  meanings that Saya@na the celebrated commentator of the Vedas  gives of the word as collected by Haug are: (_a_) food, food offering,  (_b_) the chant of the sama-singer, (_c_) magical formula or text,  (_d_) duly completed ceremonies, (_e_) the chant and sacrificial gift  together, (_f_) the recitation of the hot@r priest, (_g_) great. Roth  says that it also means \"the devotion which manifests itself as  longing and satisfaction of the soul and reaches forth to the  gods.\" But it is only in the S'atapatha Brahma@na that the conception  of Brahman has acquired a great significance as the  supreme principle which is the moving force behind the gods.  Thus the S'atapatha says, \"Verily in the beginning this (universe)  was the Brahman (neut.). It created the gods; and, having  created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this  (terrestrial) world, Vayu the air, and Surya the sky.... Then the  Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone up  to the sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again  into these worlds?' It then descended again by means of these  two, Form and Name. Whatever has a name, that is name; and  that again which has no name and which one knows by its form,  'this is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there are Form  and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe). These indeed  are the two great forces of Brahman; and, verily, he who knows  these two great forces of Brahman becomes himself a great force [Footnote  ref 3]. In another place Brahman is said to be the ultimate thing in the  Universe and is identified with Prajapati, Puru@sa and Pra@na    __________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: See _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 89, and also Muir's _Sanskrit  Texts_, vol. IV. pp. 5-11.]    [Footnote 2: Kaegi's translation.]    [Footnote 3: See Eggeling's translation of S'atapatha Brahmana _S.B.E._  vol. XLIV. pp. 27, 28.]    21    (the vital air [Footnote ref 1]). In another place Brahman is described as  being the Svayambhu (self-born) performing austerities, who offered  his own self in the creatures and the creatures in his own self,  and thus compassed supremacy, sovereignty and lordship over  all creatures [Footnote ref 2]. The conception of the supreme man (Puru@sa)  in the @Rg-Veda also supposes that the supreme man pervades the  world with only a fourth part of Himself, whereas the remaining  three parts transcend to a region beyond. He is at once the  present, past and future [Footnote ref 3].      Sacrifice; the First Rudiments of the Law of Karma.    It will however be wrong to suppose that these monotheistic  tendencies were gradually supplanting the polytheistic sacrifices.  On the other hand, the complications of ritualism were gradually  growing in their elaborate details. The direct result of this growth  contributed however to relegate the gods to a relatively unimportant  position, and to raise the dignity of the magical characteristics  of the sacrifice as an institution which could give the  desired fruits of themselves. The offerings at a sacrifice were not  dictated by a devotion with which we are familiar under Christian  or Vai@s@nava influence. The sacrifice taken as a whole is conceived  as Haug notes \"to be a kind of machinery in which every  piece must tally with the other,\" the slightest discrepancy in the  performance of even a minute ritualistic detail, say in the pouring  of the melted butter on the fire, or the proper placing of utensils  employed in the sacrifice, or even the misplacing of a mere straw  contrary to the injunctions was sufficient to spoil the whole  sacrifice with whatsoever earnestness it might be performed.  Even if a word was mispronounced the most dreadful results  might follow.

There is something  very touching in the sight of those whom the world deserts, or to  whose interests the world is at best indifferent, arousing all  their energies to battle with adverse circumstances. Then every  little addition to the daily comforts is prized, as the result of  independence and of honorable exertion--in a word, as the reward of  labor: every holiday arrives fraught not merely with enjoyment, but  with blessing. To such there are sources of happiness, which the gay,  the wealthy, the children of life's sun know nothing of, but which in  their noonday career of splendor and greatness they might well stop to  envy.    On such an existence Marguerite had entered. Hers was a simple  history, told in few words, but connected with long previous chapters  of passions and regrets; for she was the child of love, begotten  in tears, and brought up in one of those admirable foundling  establishments which prevail in Germany, and are at once the  incentives to love and the protection of its offspring. She left it a  year previously to the period when we are writing, to enter a family  of distinction as a humble friend and teacher. There Dumiger chanced  to meet her. When first he met he loved; and like all men of earnest  purpose, he loved with no common passion. The family were of that kind  so frequently met with in society--affecting great consideration for  those whom fate has placed beneath them, but expressing consideration  in such terms as made it almost an offense, and proving their vanity  in the very manner in which they affected humility. She at once  accepted Dumiger, though some months elapsed before it was possible  for them to marry. At last, by dint of great exertion, they laid aside  sufficient money to commence the world with. Dumiger had the small  apartment, within whose narrow limits his mind expanded to the  contemplation of the vast field of inquiry on which he presumed to  enter, and he transported Marguerite to her new home; there to indulge  in imaginations of love, boundless and visionary, as his were of  ambition.    The day following that which we have described there was a great  annual _fete_ at Dantzic. The free city for the time donned its freest  and most joyous manners; it was one of those days in which honest  burghers, and most especially honest burghermasters, delight,  because they are then enabled to put on their greatness with their  broadcloths; and every flag and inscription in the streets is a  tribute to their past, and an incentive to their renewed exertions.  Fortunately the day rose in more than ordinary brightness; the Mottlaw  and the Radaw, two streams which flow through the center of Dantzic,  reflected the variegated masses of colors worn by those who thronged  their banks; Commerce had for that day deserted the lofty mart and  still loftier warehouse to muse by the side of the river which bore  her richest freights; processions from the neighboring villages  marched with music at their head into the city, bearing the devices of  their various trades, and when the crowd separated to let them pass,  the captains of companies and humbler officials drew themselves up as  they traversed the rude, ill-fashioned pavement of the picturesque  and antique gabled city. It was the _fete_ of the patron saints of  the town,--strange evidence of a future state, even among those who  reflect but little; for there as ever all men turn alike to some  mysterious guardian for protection, and like this city are consecrated  to some faith. In the midst of these happy groups, which were  collected at every corner and filled every gasthof, moved Dumiger  and Marguerite, most blessed and happy where all looked smiling and  contented. Marguerite was the envy of all brides, and of those who  wished to become so; and there was not a young burgher of distinction  who had not at some time or another looked upon her with admiring  gaze, and followed her to the palace in which she dwelt, and loitered  under her window,--where, however, the thin slight curtain was rarely  if ever drawn aside to satisfy the vanity of the gazer or to kindle  her own. She was of a very admirable beauty, as perfect as is commonly  found in nature, which fancy can at will outwork,--tall, of excellent  symmetry, with a clear, noble brow, the proudest type of Nature's  glory. There were few in town who did not know her at all events, from  reputation, and that reputation was spotless. Of Dumiger's appearance  we cannot say as much: he would have been decidedly plain but for the  indications of genius which his countenance afforded. His forehead  was marked with the lines of patient and anxious thought; but these  evidences, if they did not serve to please the gazer, at least  commanded his respect. He was somewhat bent by premature exertion; the  hair, even at that early age, was thin and scanty on the temples; his  step was slightly enfeebled by want of proper exercise. Altogether  he was a very remarkable man from the intellectual power which every  lineament expressed; yet altogether he was scarcely such a person  as would have been considered likely to awaken a strong passion in  a young girl like Marguerite. For it is too true that, to use the  expression of a writer of that age, _il avait l'air d'un ame qui avait  recontre par hasard un corps et qui s'en tirait comme il pouvait_.    And yet--so strange a being is woman!--desirous like the Hindoo wife  to sacrifice herself on whatever altar she raises in her heart,  Marguerite, in order to marry Dumiger, had refused the greatest  offers,--amongst others, no less a person than the son of that house  into which she had been received. But irrespective of the affection  which she felt for Dumiger, she was in her nature proud and haughty,  and she would not have consented, even under other and less favorable  circumstances, to have entered where she was despised by the rest of  the family. It may be imagined how great indignation was excited in  this man by her refusal, the more especially as, like Dumiger, he  thought himself a proficient in science and the mechanical arts, and  was one of those who in his way was laboring for the prize so soon to  be awarded by the city. If merit was to be the test of success, he  had but little chance; but where is that man and where are those minds  with whom rank and power have not their weight? He was, therefore, if  not the most formidable by intellect, at all events by circumstance,  the one of Dumiger's competitors the most to be dreaded, for his  father was the president of that council which presided over the  destinies of Dantzic, and who usurped more than imperial authority. He  belonged to the ancient house of Albrect, Grand Master of the Teutonic  Knights, and oldest freeman of the Hanseatic League. A strange, proud  man, who when he learned indirectly that his son Frederick was in love  with Marguerite, indulged in a storm of fearful indignation, until he  found from her that on no account did she intend to accept the suit;  and then, in spite of his gratification at the certainty that his  son could not make a marriage which he thought so discreditable,  his vanity was wounded at her decision, and even while he praised  Marguerite's disinterested conduct, in his heart he was garnering up  hatred against her. A blow to vanity is terrible, and it is a blow  which the humblest and weakest can give as well as the most powerful,  in the contempt or even the indifference expressed for the pursuit in  which we are interested, or for the object which we have attained.  So much of our opinion of the value of an object depends on the price  which others set upon it, that it is sufficient to know others are  indifferent to it for ourselves to undervalue it. But Marguerite went  forward in her career of happiness, quite ignorant of the dislike she  was leaving behind her. She told Frederick the truth, that she loved  Dumiger, and kindly added, that but for this circumstance she might  one day have loved him; and then with a light heart she left the  splendid palace for the abode of poverty.    They moved on together, those two young and loving beings, and so  intent were they on their own happiness, so concentrated in each  other, that they did not observe how the crowd through which they  passed fell back in admiration: but at last Dumiger caught the  expressions of their faces, and saw the glance which accompanied them,  and then he almost looked nobly born, so proud became his step and  steadfast his gaze. The long market (surrounded with its fantastic  gables, strange, rickety, and picturesque, which looked us though they  retained the expression of the angular, quaint, rococo faces of those  by whom the houses were formerly tenanted) was crowded with all that  was gay and animated in Dantzic; around the fountains, somewhat rude  in their execution but admirable in their models, the peasants from  the neighborhood were congregated. Presently the crowd, which had  momentarily become greater and still greater, swayed backward and  forward like the tide in a harbor when a noble vessel enters its  gates. They made place for a herald, who rode on horseback surrounded  by his deputies, and gave notice in an audible voice that on that day  week the Supreme Council would"]]]
