B. was a man of  strikingly handsome appearance, and gentle and amiable character.      BAILLIE, JOANNA (1762-1851).--Dramatist and poetess, _dau._ of the  minister of Bothwell, afterwards Professor of Divinity at Glasgow. Her  mother was a sister of the great anatomists, William and John Hunter, and  her brother was the celebrated physician, Matthew B., of London. She  received a thorough education at Glasgow, and at an early age went to  London, where the remainder of her long, happy, and honoured, though  uneventful, life was passed. In 1798, when she was 36, the first vol. of  her _Plays on the Passions_ appeared, and was received with much favour,  other two vols. followed in 1802 and 1812, and she also produced  _Miscellaneous Plays_ in 1804, and 3 vols. of _Dramatic Poetry_ in 1836.  In all her works there are many passages of true and impressive poetry,  but the idea underlying her _Plays on the Passions_, that, namely, of  exhibiting the principal character as acting under the exclusive  influence of one passion, is artificial and untrue to nature.      BAILLIE, LADY GRIZEL (1665-1746).--Poetess, _dau._ of Sir Patrick Home or  Hume, afterwards Earl of Marchmont, was married to George Baillie of  Jerviswoode. In her childhood she showed remarkable courage and address  in the services she rendered to her father and his friend, Robert Baillie  of Jerviswoode, the eminent Scottish patriot, when under persecution. She  left many pieces both prose and verse in MS., some of which were _pub._  The best known is the beautiful song, _Were na my heart licht I wad die_.      BAILLIE, ROBERT (1599-1662).--Historical writer, _s._ of B. of Jerviston,  _ed._ at Glasgow, he entered the Church of Scotland and became minister  of Kilwinning in Ayrshire. His abilities soon made him a leading man. He  was a member of the historic Assembly of 1638, when Presbyterianism was  re-established in Scotland, and also of the Westminster Assembly, 1643.  In 1651 he was made Professor of Divinity in Glasgow, and 10 years later  Principal. His _Letters and Journals_, edited for the Bannatyne Club by  D. Laing (_q.v._), are of the greatest value for the interesting light  they throw on a period of great importance in Scottish history. He was  one of the wisest and most temperate churchmen of his time.      BAIN, ALEXANDER (1818-1903).--Philosopher, _b._ at Aberdeen, and  graduated at Marischal Coll. there, became in 1860 Professor of Logic in  his university, and wrote a number of works on philosophy and psychology,  including _The Senses and the Intellect_ (1855), _The Emotions and the  Will_, _Mental and Moral Science_ (1868), _Logic_ (1870), and _Education  as a Science_ (1879). In 1881 he was elected Lord Rector of Aberdeen  University.      BAKER, SIR RICHARD (1568-1645).--Historian and religious writer, studied  law, was knighted in 1603, and was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire 1620. B.  was the author of _The Chronicle of the Kings of England_ (1643), which  was for long held as a great authority among the country gentlemen. It  has, however, many errors. B. fell on evil days, was thrown into the  Fleet for debt incurred by others, for which he had made himself  responsible, and _d._ there. It was during his durance that the  _Chronicle_ and some religious treatises were composed. The _Chronicle_  was continued by Edward Phillips, Milton's nephew, who became a strong  Royalist.      BAKER, SIR SAMUEL WHITE (1821-1893).--Traveller, _b._ in London, and  after being a planter in Ceylon, and superintending the construction of a  railway between the Danube and the Black Sea, went with his wife, a  Hungarian lady, in search of the sources of the Nile, and discovered the  great lake, Albert Nyanza. B. was knighted in 1866, and was for 4 years  Governor-General of the Equatorial Nile Basin. His books, which are all  on travel and sport, are well written and include _Albert Nyanza_ (1866),  _Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia_ (1867).      BALE, JOHN (1495-1563).--Historian and controversialist, _b._ at Cove,  Suffolk, and _ed._ as a Carmelite friar, but becoming a Protestant,  engaged in violent controversy with the Roman Catholics. After undergoing  persecution and flying to Flanders, he was brought back by Edward VI. and  made Bishop of Ossory. On the death of Edward he was again persecuted,  and had to escape from Ireland to Holland, but returned on the accession  of Elizabeth, who made him a Prebendary of Canterbury. His chief work is  a Latin _Account of the Lives of Eminent Writers of Great Britain_.  Besides this he wrote some dramas on scriptural subjects, and an account  of the trial and death of Sir John Oldcastle. He wrote in all 22 plays,  of which only 5 have come down, the names of certain of which give some  idea of their nature, _e.g._, _The Three Leaves of Nature_, _Moses and  Christ_, and _The Temptacyon of Our Lord_.      BALLANTINE, JAMES (1808-1877).--Artist and author, _b._ in Edinburgh,  began life as a house painter. He studied art, and became one of the  first to revive the art of glass-painting, on which subject he wrote a  treatise. He was the author of _The Gaberlunzie's Wallet_ (1843), _Miller  of Deanhaugh_ (1845), _Poems_ (1856), _100 Songs with Music_ (1865), and  a _Life of David Roberts, R.A._ (1866).      BALLANTYNE, ROBERT MICHAEL (1825-1894).--Writer of tales for boys, _b._  in Edinburgh, was a connection of the well-known printers. As a youth he  spent some years in the service of the Hudson's Bay Co., and was then a  member of Constable's printing firm. In 1856 he took to literature as a  profession, and _pub._ about 80 tales, which, abounding in interesting  adventure and information, and characterised by a thoroughly healthy  tone, had great popularity. Among them are _The Young Fur Traders_  (1856), _The Coral Island_, _Fighting the Flames_, _Martin Rattler_, _The  World of Ice_, _The Dog Crusoe_, _Erling the Bold_, and _Black Ivory_. B.  was also an accomplished water-colour artist, and in all respects lived  up to the ideals he sought to instil into his readers. He _d._ at Rome.      BANCROFT, GEORGE (1800-1891).--American historian, _b._ at Worcester,  Massachusetts, and after _grad._ at Harvard, studied in Germany, where he  became acquainted and corresponded with Goethe, Hegel, and other leaders  of German thought. Returning to America he began his _History of the  United States_ (1834-74). The work covers the period from the discovery  of the Continent to the conclusion of the Revolutionary War in 1782. His  other great work is _The History of the Formation of the Constitution of  the United States_ (1882). B. filled various political offices, and was  in 1846 Minister Plenipotentiary to England, and in 1867 Minister to  Prussia. His writing is clear and vigorous, and his facts generally  accurate, but he is a good deal of a partisan.      BANIM, JOHN (1798-1842).--Novelist, began life as a miniature painter,  but was led by the success of his first book, _Tales of the O'Hara  Family_, to devote himself to literature. The object which he set before  himself was to become to Ireland what Scott has been to Scotland, and the  influence of his model is distinctly traceable in his writings. His  strength lies in the delineation of the characters of the Irish lower  classes, and the impulses, often misguided and criminal, by which they  are influenced, and in this he has shown remarkable power. The first  series of the _O'Hara Tales_ appeared in 1825, the second in 1826. Other  works are _The Croppy_ (1828), _The Denounced_ (1830), _The Smuggler_  (1831), _The Mayor of Windgap_, and his last, _Father Connell_. Most of  these deal with the darker and more painful phases of life, but the  feeling shown in the last-named is brighter and tenderer. B. latterly  suffered from illness and consequent poverty, which were alleviated by a  pension from Government. He also wrote some poems, including _The Celt's  Paradise_, and one or two plays. In the _O'Hara Tales_, he was assisted  by his brother, MICHAEL BANIM (1796-1874), and there is difficulty in  allocating their respective contributions. After the death of John,  Michael wrote _Clough Fionn_ (1852), and _The Town of the Cascades_  (1864).      BANNATYNE, RICHARD (_d._ 1605).--Secretary to John Knox, compiled  _Memorials of Transactions in Scotland from 1569 to 1573_.      BARBAULD, ANNA LETITIA (1743-1825).--Poetess, etc., _dau._ of Dr. John  Aikin (_q.v._), was _b._ at Kibworth-Hencourt, Leicestershire. Her _f._  kept an academy for boys, whose education she shared, and thus became  acquainted with the classics. In 1773 she _pub._ a collection of  miscellaneous poems, which was well received, and in the following year  she married the Rev. R. Barbauld, a French Protestant and dissenting  minister, who also conducted a school near Palgrave in Suffolk. Into this  enterprise Mrs. B. threw herself with great energy, and, mainly owing to  her talents and reputation, it proved a success and was afterwards  carried on at Hampstead and Newington Green. Meantime, she continued her  literary occupations, and brought out various devotional works, including  her _Hymns in Prose for Children_. These were followed by _Evenings at  Home_, _Selections from the English Essayists_, _The Letters of Samuel  Richardson_, with a life prefixed, and a selection from the British  novelists with introductory essay.      BARBOUR, JOHN (1316?-1395).--Poet. Of B.'s youth nothing is certainly  known, but it is believed that he was _b._ near Aberdeen, and studied at  Oxford and Paris. He entered the Church, and rose to ecclesiastical  preferment and Royal favour. He is known to have been Archdeacon of  Aberdeen in 1357, when, and again in 1364, he went with some young  scholars to Oxford, and he also held various"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#8)"],[1,"the R.C.

PRENTISS, one of the most distinguished popular orators of  the age, died at Natchez, Mississippi, on the 3d inst. He was a native  of Maine, and after being admitted to the bar he emigrated to the  Southwest, where his great natural genius, with his energy and  perseverance, soon gained for him a well-deserved reputation as one  of the most successful advocates at the bar, and as one of the most  brilliant and effective speakers in all that part of the country,  where \"stumping\" is the almost universal practice among political  aspirants.    He was once elected to the House of Representatives from his adopted  State, and was excluded from his seat by the casting vote of James K.  Polk, at that time Speaker of the House. The facts in regard to the  affair, according to the _Tribune_, are substantially as follows:  In 1837, the President, Mr. Van Buren, called an Extra Session  of Congress to assemble in September of that year. The laws of  Mississippi required that the election for Congressmen for that State  for the twenty-fifth Congress should be held in November, and in  order that the State should be represented in the Extra Session, the  Governor ordered an election to be held in July for the choice of  two Congressmen \"to fill the vacancy until superseded by the members  to be elected at the next regular election, on the first Monday, and  the day following, in November next.\" The election was held under  the authority of the Governor's proclamation, and the Democratic  candidates, Claiborne and Gholson, were elected by default. They took  their seats in the House, in which there was a decided Democratic  majority, and immediately applied themselves to the task of inducing  the House to declare that they had been duly elected not only for the  Extra Session, but for the full term of two fears following. Of course  they accomplished their object. The November Election arrived and the  Whigs nominated Prentiss and Word. The Democrats brought out Claiborne  and Gholson again, and the result was that the Whig candidates were  chosen by a triumphant majority. They received their certificates  of election from the proper authority and presented themselves at  the regular session of Congress in December, and found their seats  occupied by the brace of Democrats whom the people of Mississippi  had elected to stay at home, and after a most severe and memorable  contest, the new members presented themselves for admission at the bar  of the House, which decided readily that Claiborne and Gholson were  not entitled to their places, but instead of admitting Prentiss  and Word, by Mr. Polk's casting vote declared the seats vacant, and  referred the whole subject back to the people. During the discussion  of the question Mr. Prentiss made a speech which will be remembered  and admired as long as genius and true manly eloquence are  appreciated. Another election was held in the following month of  March, and Prentiss and Word were again returned, and this time  they were admitted to their seats. The remaining session of the  twenty-fifth Congress, Prentiss served with distinguished ability. We  believe this closed his career as a statesman. He recently removed  to New Orleans, where he continued the practice of the law, standing  always at the head of his profession.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LATE HON. NATHANIEL SILSBEE, according to the Salem, Mass.  _Gazette_, of the 16th inst., began his career soon after the breaking  out of the French revolution, and the general warfare in which all  Europe became embroiled. At this favorable point of time, Mr. S.  having finished his term of service at one of our best private schools  of instruction, under the Rev. Dr. Cutler, of Hamilton, and having  abandoned the collegiate course for which he had been prepared,  and been initiated into the forms of business and knowledge of  the counting-room, he engaged in the employ of one of our most  enterprising merchants, Hasket Derby, Esq., the leader of the vanguard  of India adventures. At the age of 18, he embarked on the sea of  fortune as clerk of a merchant vessel. On his next voyage he took the  command of a vessel, and before he arrived at the age of 21, he sailed  for the East Indies in a vessel, which, at this day, would scarcely be  deemed suitable for a coasting craft, uncoppered, without the improved  nautical instruments and science which now universally prevail,  trusting only to his dead reckoning, his eyes, and his head, not  one on board having attained to the age of his majority. He served  successively as representative in our State Legislature, as member of  Congress for six years, as State Senator, over which body he presided,  and as Senator in Congress, for nine years, with honor to himself, and  satisfaction to his constituents. In all commercial questions which  presented themselves to the consideration of Congress, while a member  of both houses, no man's opinion was more sought for and more justly  respected.           *       *       *       *       *    SEVERAL FAMOUS FRENCHMEN have left the world within a few weeks.  Quatremere de Quincy, who was in the first rank of archaeology and  aesthetics, died at the age of ninety-five; Count Mollien, the famous  financier--often a minister--at eighty-seven; Baron Meneval, so long  the private, confidential, all-trusted private secretary of Napoleon,  between seventy and eighty; Count Berenger, one of the Emperor's  Councillors and Peers, conspicuous for the independence of his spirit,  as well as administrative qualifications, was four-score and upward.  The obsequies of these personages were grand ceremonials. President  Napoleon sent his carriages and orderly officers to honor the remains  of the old servants of his uncle. This class might be thought to  have found an elixir of life, in their devotion to the Emperor or  his memory. A few of them survive, like Marshal Soult, wonders of  comfortable longevity.           *       *       *       *       *    REMARKABLE WORK BY A CHINESE.    To the man of science, the philanthropist and the Christian, it will  prove a stirring incident that a work on Geography has just been  issued by a native Chinese, embracing the history and condition of  other nations. Here is a stroke, such as has never yet been dealt  against the ignorance and prejudice which has erected such a wall of  exclusiveness around three hundred millions of people. A Lieutenant  Governor is the author, and, by a commendatory preface, it is pressed  upon the notice of his countrymen by a Governor General--both of these  men high in office in the Chinese Government.    In reference to his map of the world, the writer remarks: \"We knew  in respect to a Northern frozen ocean, but in respect to a Southern  frozen ocean we had not heard. So that, when Western men produced maps  having a frozen ocean at the extreme South, we supposed that they  had made a mistake in not understanding the Chinese language, and had  placed that in the South which should have been placed only in the  North. But on inquiring of an American, one Abeel, (the Missionary,)  he said this doctrine was verily true, and should not be doubted.\"    It is a fact full of interest that the chronology adopted in this work  is that usually received by European writers. The more prominent facts  of sacred history subsequent to the Deluge, are either alluded to, or  stated at length, much as they occur in the Scriptures.    It is interesting to us, too, that this work presents to the Chinese  a more definite and discriminating view of the different religions of  the world, than has yet appeared in the Chinese language.    Speaking of different countries of India under European sway, where  Buddhism or Paganism and Protestantism exist together, the author  does not hesitate to say that the latter is gradually overcoming the  former, \"whose light is becoming more and more dim.\" This is a very  remarkable concession, when we consider that the individual who makes  it is probably a Buddhist himself, and represents the religion of  China as Buddhism.    It is a remarkable fact, that this work contains a more extensive and  correct account of the history and institution of Christian nations  than has ever been published before by any heathen writer in any age  of the world.    This remarkable work will introduce the \"Celestials\" to such an  acquaintance with \"the outside barbarians\" as cannot fail to give them  new ideas, remove something at least of the insane prejudice against,  and contempt of, all other nations, which has so long prevailed.  We regard it as a very important agency in preparing the way for  that Christianity which the friends of the perishing are seeking to  introduce into that benighted empire. A book by a native Chinaman,  himself high in office, and recommended by a still higher officer  of the government, the author still himself a Pagan, yet reasoning  upon the great facts of the Bible, and opening the hitherto unknown  civilized and Christian world to his countrymen--such a book cannot  but become an important pioneer in the work of pouring the light of  truth upon that dark land.--_Boston Traveler_.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM SARTAIN'S MAGAZINE, FOR AUGUST.]      REQUIEM.
