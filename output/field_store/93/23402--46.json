[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV. (#8)"],[1,"     This celebrated poet was the son of Mr. George Prior, citizen of  London, who was by profession a Joiner. Our author was born in 1664.  His father dying when he was very young, left him to the care of an  uncle, a Vintner near Charing-Cross, who discharged the trust that was  reposed in him, with a tenderness truly paternal, as Mr. Prior always  acknowledged with the highest professions of gratitude. He received  part of his education at Westminster school, where he distinguished  himself to great advantage, but was afterwards taken home by his  uncle in order to be bred up to his trade. Notwithstanding this mean  employment, to which Mr. Prior seemed now doomed, yet at his leisure  hours he prosecuted his study of the classics, and especially his  favourite Horace, by which means he was soon taken notice of, by the  polite company, who resorted to his uncle's house. It happened one  day, that the earl of Dorset being at his Tavern, which he often  frequented with several gentlemen of rank, the discourse turned upon  the Odes of Horace; and the company being divided in their sentiments  about a passage in that poet, one of the gentlemen said, I find we are  not like to agree in our criticisms, but, if I am not mistaken, there  is a young fellow in the house, who is able to set us all right: upon  which he named Prior, who was immediately sent for, and desired to  give his opinion of Horace's meaning in the Ode under consideration;  this he did with great modesty, and so much to the satisfaction of  the company, that the earl of Dorset, from that moment, determined to  remove him from the station in which he was, to one more suited to his  genius; and accordingly procured him to be sent to St. John's College  in Cambridge, where he took his degree in 1686, and afterwards became  fellow of the College.    During his residence in the university, he contracted an intimate  friendship with Charles Montague, esq; afterwards earl of Hallifax,  in conjunction with whom he wrote a very humorous piece, entitled The  Hind and Panther transversed to the story of the Country Mouse, and  the City Mouse, printed 1687 in 4to. in answer to Mr. Dryden's Hind  and the Panther, published the year before.    Upon the revolution Mr. Prior was brought to court by his great patron  the earl of Dorset, by whose interest he was introduced to public  employment, and in the year 1690 was made secretary to the earl  of Berkley, plenipotentiary to King William and Queen Mary at the  Congress at the Hague.    In this station he acquitted himself so well, that he was afterwards  appointed secretary to the earls of Pembroke, and Jersey, and Sir  Joseph Williamson, ambassadors, and plenipotentiaries, at the treaty  of Ryswick 1697, as he was likewise in 1698 to the earl of Portland,  ambassador to the court of France. While he was in that kingdom, one  of the officers of the French King's houshold, shewing him the royal  apartments, and curiosities at Versailles, especially the paintings of  Le Brun, wherein the victories of Lewis XIV. are described, asked him,  whether King William's actions are to be seen in his palace? 'No Sir,  replied Mr. Prior, the monuments of my master's actions are to be seen  every where, but in his own house.'    In the year 1697 Mr. Prior was made secretary of state for Ireland,  and in 1700 was created master of arts by Mandamus, and appointed  one of the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, upon the  resignation of Mr. Locke. He was also Member of Parliament for  East-Grimstead in Sussex. In 1710 he was supposed to have had a share  in writing the Examiner, and particularly a Criticism in it upon a  Poem of Dr. Garth to the earl of Godolphin, taken notice of in the  life of Garth.    About this time, when Godolphin was defeated by Oxford, and the Tories  who had long been eclipsed by the lustre of Marlborough, began again  to hold up their heads, Mr. Prior and Dr. Garth espoused opposite  interests; Mr. Prior wrote for, and Garth against the court. The Dr.  was so far honest, that he did not desert his patron in distress; and  notwithstanding the cloud which then hung upon the party, he addressed  verses to him, which, however they may fail in the poetry, bear strong  the marks of gratitude, and honour.    While Mr. Prior was thus very early initiated in public business, and  continued in the hurry of affairs for many years, it must appear not  a little surprizing, that he should find sufficient opportunities to  cultivate his poetical talents, to the amazing heights he raised them.  In his preface to his poems, he says, that poetry was only the product  of his leisure hours; that he had commonly business enough upon his  hands, and, as he modestly adds, was only a poet by accident; but we  must take the liberty of differing from him in the last particular,  for Mr. Prior seems to have received from the muses, at his nativity,  all the graces they could well bestow on their greatest favourite.    We must not omit one instance in Mr. Prior's conduct, which will  appear very remarkable: he was chosen a member of that Parliament  which impeached the Partition Treaty, to which he himself had been  secretary; and though his share in that transaction was consequently  very considerable, yet he joined in the impeachment upon an honest  principle of conviction, that exceptionable measures attended it.    The lord Bolingbroke, who, notwithstanding many exceptions made both  to his conduct, and sentiments in other instances, yet must be allowed  to be an accomplished judge of fine talents, entertained the highest  esteem for Mr. Prior, on account of his shining abilities. This noble  lord, in a letter dated September 10, 1712, addressed to Mr. Prior,  while he was the Queen's minister, and plenipotentiary at the court of  France, pays him the following compliment; 'For God's sake, Matt. hide  the nakedness of thy country, and give the best turn thy fertile brain  will furnish thee with, to the blunders of thy countrymen, who are not  much better politicians, than the French are poets.' His lordship thus  concludes his epistle; 'It is near three o'clock in the morning, I  have been hard at work all day, and am not yet enough recovered to  bear much fatigue; excuse therefore the confusedness of this scroll,  which is only from Harry to Matt, and not from the secretary to the  minister. Adieu, my pen is ready to drop out of my hand, it being now  three o'clock in the morning; believe that no man loves you better, or  is more faithfully yours, &c.    'BOLINGBROKE.'    There are several other letters from Bolingbroke to Prior, which, were  it necessary, we might insert as evidences of his esteem for him; but  Mr. Prior was in every respect so great a man, that the esteem even of  lord Bolingbroke cannot add much to the lustre of his reputation,  both as a statesman, and a poet. Mr. Prior is represented by those who  knew, and have wrote concerning him, as a gentleman, who united the  elegance and politeness of a court, with the scholar, and the man of  genius. This representation, in general, may be just, yet it holds  almost invariably true, that they who have risen from low life, still  retain some traces of their original. No cultivation, no genius, it  seems, is able entirely to surmount this: There was one particular in  which Mr. Prior verified the old proverb.    The same woman who could charm the waiter in a tavern, still  maintained her dominion over the embassador at France. The Chloe of  Prior, it seems, was a woman in this station of life; but he never  forsook her in the heighth of his reputation. Hence we may observe,  that associations with women are the most lasting of all, and  that when an eminent station raises a man above many other acts of  condescension, a mistress will maintain her influence, charm away the  pride of greatness, and make the hero who fights, and the patriot  who speaks, for the liberty of his country, a slave to her. One would  imagine however, that this woman, who was a Butcher's wife, must  either have been very handsome, or have had something about her  superior to people of her rank: but it seems the case was otherwise,  and no better reason can be given for Mr. Prior's attachment to her,  but that she was his taste. Her husband suffered their intrigue to go  on unmolested; for he was proud even of such a connexion as this, with  so great a man as Prior; a singular instance of good nature.    In the year 1715 Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and upon his  arrival was taken up by a warrant from the House of Commons; shortly  after which, he underwent a very strict examination by a Committee of  the Privy Council. His political friend, lord Bolingbroke, foreseeing  a storm, took shelter in France, and secured Harry, but left poor  Matt. in the lurch.    On the 10th of June Robert Walpole, esq; moved the House against  him, and on the 17th Mr. Prior was ordered into close custody, and no  person was admitted to see him without leave from the Speaker. For  the particulars of this procedure of the Parliament, both against Mr.  Prior, and many others concerned in the public transactions of the  preceding reign, we refer to the histories of that time. In the year  1717 an Act of Grace was passed in favour of those who had opposed  the Hanoverian succession, as well as those who had been in open  rebellion, but Mr. Prior was excepted out of it. At the close of this  year, however, he was discharged from his confinement, and retired to  spend the residue of his days at Downhall in Essex.    The severe usage which Mr. Prior met with, perhaps was the occasion of  the following beautiful lines, addressed to his Chloe;      From public noise, and factious strife,    From all the busy ills of life,    Take me, my Chloe, to thy breast;    And lull my wearied soul to rest:    For ever, in this humble cell,    Let thee and I, my fair one, dwell;    None enter else, but Love----and he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#8)"],[1,"tep-father  to Italy, and Hortense went as a pupil to Madame Campan's  boarding-school. The former, lady-in-waiting to Queen Marie Antoinette,  had, at that time, opened an establishment for the education of young  ladies, at St. Germain, and the greatest and most eminent families of  newly-republicanized France liked to send their daughters to it, so that  they might learn from the former court-lady the refined style and  manners of old royalist times.    Hortense was, therefore, sent to that boarding-school, and there, in the  society of her new Aunt Caroline--the sister of Bonaparte, and afterward  Queen of Naples--and the young Countess Stephanie Beauharnais, her  cousin, passed a few happy years of work, of varied study, and of  youthful maiden-dreams.    Hortense devoted herself with iron diligence, and untiring enthusiasm,  to her studies, which consisted, not only in the acquisition of  languages, in music, and drawing, history and geography, but still more  in the mastering the so-called _bon ton_ and that aristocratic _savoir  vivre_ of which Madame Campan was a very model. While Hortense was thus  receiving instruction on the harp from the celebrated Alvimara, in  painting from Isabey, dancing from Coulon, and singing from Lambert, and  was playing on the stage of the amateur theatre at the boarding-school  the parts of heroines and lady-loves; while she was participating in the  balls and concerts that Madame Campan gave in order to show off the  talent of her pupils to the friends she invited; while, in a word,  Hortense was thus being trained up to the accomplishments of a  distinguished woman of the world, she did not dream how useful all these  little details, so trivial, apparently, at the time, would one day be to  her, and how good a thing it was that she had learned to play parts at  Madame Campan's, and to appear in society as a great lady.    Meanwhile, Josephine was passing days of gratified pride and exulting  triumph at Paris, for the star of her hero was ascending, brighter and  brighter in its effulgence, above the horizon; the name of Bonaparte was  echoing in louder and louder volume through the world, and filling all  Europe with a sort of awe-inspired fear and trembling, as the sea  becomes agitated when the sun begins to rise. Victory after victory came  joyfully heralded from Italy, as ancient states fell beneath the iron  tread of the victor, and new ones sprang into being. The splendid old  Republic of Venice, once the terror of the whole world, the victorious  Queen of the Adriatic, had to bow her haughty head, and her diadem fell  in fragments at the feet of her triumphant conqueror. The lion of St.  Mark's no longer made mankind tremble at his angry roar, and the slender  monumental pillars on the Piazzetta were all that remained to the  shattered and fallen Venetian Republic of her conquests in Candia,  Cyprus, and the Morea. But, from the dust and ashes of the old  commonwealth, there arose, at Bonaparte's command, a new state, the  Cisalpine Republic, as a new and youthful daughter of the French  Republic; and, when the last Doge of Venice, Luigi Manin, laid his  peaked crown at the feet of Bonaparte, and then fainted away, another  Venetian, Dandolo, the son of a family that had given Venice the  greatest and most celebrated of her doges, stepped to the front at the  head of the new republic--that Dandolo of whom Bonaparte had said that  he was \"a man.\"    \"Good God!\" exclaimed Bonaparte one day to Bourrienne, \"how seldom one  meets _men_ in the world! In Italy there are eighteen millions of  inhabitants, but I have found only two _men_ among them all--Dandolo and  Melzi[6].\"    [Footnote 6: Bourrienne, vol. i., p. 139.]    But, while Bonaparte was despairing of _men_, in the very midst of his  victories, he cherished the warmest, most impassioned love for his wife,  to whom he almost daily wrote the tenderest and most ardent letters, the  answers to which he awaited with the most impatient longing.    Josephine's letters formed the sole exception to a very unusual and  singular system that Bonaparte had adopted during a part of his  campaign in Italy. This was to leave a11 written communications,  excepting such as came to him by special couriers, unread for three  weeks. He threw them all into a large basket, and opened them only on  the twenty-first day thereafter. Still, General Bonaparte was more  considerate than Cardinal Dubois, who immediately consigned _all_ the  communications he received to the flames, _unread_, and--while the fire  on his hearth was consuming the paper on which, perchance, was written  the despairing appeal of a mother, imploring pardon for her son; of a  disconsolate wife, beseeching pity for her husband; or the application  of an ambitious statesman, desiring promotion--would point to them with  a sardonic smile, and say, \"There's _my_ correspondence!\" Bonaparte, at  least, gave the letters a perusal, three weeks after they reached him,  indeed; but those three weeks saved him and his secretary, Bourrienne,  much time and labor, for, when they finally went to work on them, time  and circumstances had already disposed of four fifths of them, and thus  only one fifth required answers--a result that made Bonaparte laugh  heartily, and filled him with justifiable pride in what he termed his  \"happy idea.\"    Josephine's letters, however, had not an hour or a minute to wait ere  they were read. Bonaparte always received them with his heart bounding  with delight, and invariably answered them, in such impassioned, glowing  language as only his warm southern temperament could suggest, and  contrasted with which even Josephine's missives seemed a little cool and  passionless.    Ere long Bonaparte ceased to be satisfied with merely getting letters  from his Josephine. He desired to have her, in person, with him; and  hardly had the tempest of war begun to lull, ere the general summoned  his beloved to his side at Milan. She obeyed his call with rapture, and  hastened to Italy to join him. Now came proud days of triumph and  gratified affection. All Italy hailed Bonaparte as the conquering hero;  all Italy did homage to the woman who bore his name, and whose  incomparable fascination and amiability, gracefulness and beauty, won  all hearts. Her life now resembled a magnificent, glorified, triumphal  pageant; a dazzling fairy festival; a tale from the \"Arabian Nights\"  that had become reality, with Josephine for its enchanted heroine,  sparkling with stars, and gleaming with golden sunshine.        CHAPTER VII.    VICISSITUDES OF DESTINY.    Resplendent was the triumphal procession with which Bonaparte made his  proud entry into Paris, on his return from Italy. In the front courtyard  of the Luxembourg, the palace occupied by the _Corps Legislatif_, was  erected a vast amphitheatre, in which sat all the high authorities of  France; in the centre of the amphitheatre stood the altar of the  country, surmounted by three gigantic statues, representing Freedom,  Equality, and Peace. As Bonaparte stepped into this space, all the  dense crowd that occupied the seats of the amphitheatre rose to their  feet with uncovered heads, to hail the conqueror of Italy, and the  windows of the palace were thronged with handsomely dressed ladies, who  waved welcome to the young hero with their handkerchiefs. But suddenly  this splendid festival was marred by a serious mischance. An officer of  the Directory, who, the better to satisfy his curiosity, had clambered  up on the scaffolding of the right-side wing of the palace, then  undergoing extension, fell from it, and struck the ground almost at  Napoleon's feet. A shout of terror burst almost simultaneously from a  thousand throats, and the ladies turned pale and shrank back,  shuddering, from the windows. The palace, which a moment before had  exhibited such a wealth of adornment in these living flowers, now stood  there bare, with empty, gaping casements. A perceptible thrill ran  through the ranks of the _Corps Legislatif_, and here and there the  whisper passed that this fall of an officer portended the early  overthrow of the Directory itself, and that it, too, would soon, like  the unfortunate victim of the accident, be lying in its death agonies at  the feet of General Bonaparte.    But the Directory, nevertheless, hastened to give the victor of Arcola  new _fetes_ every day; and when these _fetes_ were over, and Bonaparte,  fatigued with the speeches, the festivities, the toasts, etc., would be  on his way returning homeward, there was the populace of Paris, who  beset his path in crowds, to greet him with hearty cheers; and these  persistent friends he had to recognize, with smiles and shakings of the  hand, or with a nod and a pleasant glance.    A universal jubilee of delight had seized upon the French. Each  individual saw in Bonaparte renown and greatness reflected on himself.  Every one regarded him as the most brilliant impersonation of his own  inner personality, and, therefore, felt drawn toward him with a sort of  reverential exultation.    Josephine gave herself up with her whole soul to the enjoyment of these  glorious occasions. While Bonaparte, almost completely overwhelmed and  disturbed, could have held aloof from these ovations of the people of  Paris, they, on the contrary, filled the heart of his wife with pride  and joy. While in the theatre, he shrank back, abashed, behind his  wife's chair when the audience, learning his presence, filled their  noisy plaudits and clamored to have a glimpse at him, Josephine would  thank the crowd on his behalf with a bewitching smile, and eyes swelling  with tears for this proof of their regard, which to her seemed but a  natural and appropriate tribute to her Achilles, her lion-hearted hero.  But Bonaparte did not allow himself to be blinded by these  demonstrations; and one day, when popular enthusiasm seemed as though it  would never end, and the"]]]
