The internal sanction of duty, whatever  our standard of duty may be, is one and the same--a feeling in our own  mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty,  which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious  cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility. This feeling, when  disinterested, and connecting itself with the pure idea of duty, and  not with some particular form of it, or with any of the merely accessory  circumstances, is the essence of Conscience; though in that complex  phenomenon as it actually exists, the simple fact is in general all  encrusted over with collateral associations, derived from sympathy, from  love, and still more from fear; from all the forms of religious feeling;  from the recollections of childhood and of all our past life; from  self-esteem, desire of the esteem of others, and occasionally even  self-abasement. This extreme complication is, I apprehend, the origin of  the sort of mystical character which, by a tendency of the human mind of  which there are many other examples, is apt to be attributed to the idea  of moral obligation, and which leads people to believe that the idea  cannot possibly attach itself to any other objects than those which, by  a supposed mysterious law, are found in our present experience to excite  it. Its binding force, however, consists in the existence of a mass of  feeling which must be broken through in order to do what violates our  standard of right, and which, if we do nevertheless violate that  standard, will probably have to be encountered afterwards in the form of  remorse. Whatever theory we have of the nature or origin of conscience,  this is what essentially constitutes it.    The ultimate sanction, therefore, of all morality (external motives  apart) being a subjective feeling in our own minds, I see nothing  embarrassing to those whose standard is utility, in the question, what  is the sanction of that particular standard? We may answer, the same as  of all other moral standards--the conscientious feelings of mankind.  Undoubtedly this sanction has no binding efficacy on those who do not  possess the feelings it appeals to; but neither will these persons be  more obedient to any other moral principle than to the utilitarian one.  On them morality of any kind has no hold but through the external  sanctions. Meanwhile the feelings exist, a feet in human nature, the  reality of which, and the great power with which they are capable of  acting on those in whom they have been duly cultivated, are proved by  experience. No reason has ever been shown why they may not be cultivated  to as great intensity in connection with the utilitarian, as with any  other rule of morals.    There is, I am aware, a disposition to believe that a person who sees in  moral obligation a transcendental fact, an objective reality belonging  to the province of \"Things in themselves,\" is likely to be more obedient  to it than one who believes it to be entirely subjective, having its  seat in human consciousness only. But whatever a person's opinion may be  on this point of Ontology, the force he is really urged by is his own  subjective feeling, and is exactly measured by its strength. No one's  belief that Duty is an objective reality is stronger than the belief  that God is so; yet the belief in God, apart from the expectation of  actual reward and punishment, only operates on conduct through, and in  proportion to, the subjective religious feeling. The sanction, so far as  it is disinterested, is always in the mind itself; and the notion,  therefore, of the transcendental moralists must be, that this sanction  will not exist _in_ the mind unless it is believed to have its root out  of the mind; and that if a person is able to say to himself, That which  is restraining me, and which is called my conscience, is only a feeling  in my own mind, he may possibly draw the conclusion that when the  feeling ceases the obligation ceases, and that if he find the feeling  inconvenient, he may disregard it, and endeavour to get rid of it. But  is this danger confined to the utilitarian morality? Does the belief  that moral obligation has its seat outside the mind make the feeling of  it too strong to be got rid of? The fact is so far otherwise, that all  moralists admit and lament the ease with which, in the generality of  minds, conscience can be silenced or stifled. The question, Need I obey  my conscience? is quite as often put to themselves by persons who never  heard of the principle of utility, as by its adherents. Those whose  conscientious feelings are so weak as to allow of their asking this  question, if they answer it affirmatively, will not do so because they  believe in the transcendental theory, but because of the external  sanctions.    It is not necessary, for the present purpose, to decide whether the  feeling of duty is innate or implanted. Assuming it to be innate, it is  an open question to what objects it naturally attaches itself; for the  philosophic supporters of that theory are now agreed that the intuitive  perception is of principles of morality, and not of the details. If  there be anything innate in the matter, I see no reason why the feeling  which is innate should not be that of regard to the pleasures and pains  of others. If there is any principle of morals which is intuitively  obligatory, I should say it must be that. If so, the intuitive ethics  would coincide with the utilitarian, and there would be no further  quarrel between them. Even as it is, the intuitive moralists, though  they believe that there are other intuitive moral obligations, do  already believe this to be one; for they unanimously hold that a large  portion of morality turns upon the consideration due to the interests of  our fellow creatures. Therefore, if the belief in the transcendental  origin of moral obligation gives any additional efficacy to the internal  sanction, it appears to me that the utilitarian principle has already  the benefit of it.    On the other hand, if, as is my own belief, the moral feelings are not  innate, but acquired, they are not for that reason the less natural. It  is natural to man to speak, to reason, to build cities, to cultivate the  ground, though these are acquired faculties. The moral feelings are not  indeed a part of our nature, in the sense of being in any perceptible  degree present in all of us; but this, unhappily, is a fact admitted by  those who believe the most strenuously in their transcendental origin.  Like the other acquired capacities above referred to, the moral faculty,  if not a part of our nature, is a natural outgrowth from it; capable,  like them, in a certain small degree, of springing up spontaneously; and  susceptible of being brought by cultivation to a high degree of  development. Unhappily it is also susceptible, by a sufficient use of  the external sanctions and of the force of early impressions, of being  cultivated in almost any direction: so that there is hardly anything so  absurd or so mischievous that it may not, by means of these influences,  be made to act on the human mind with all the authority of conscience.  To doubt that the same potency might be given by the same means to the  principle of utility, even if it had no foundation in human nature,  would be flying in the face of all experience.    But moral associations which are wholly of artificial creation, when  intellectual culture goes on, yield by degrees to the dissolving force  of analysis: and if the feeling of duty, when associated with utility,  would appear equally arbitrary; if there were no leading department of  our nature, no powerful class of sentiments, with which that association  would harmonize, which would make us feel it congenial, and incline us  not only to foster it in others (for which we have abundant interested  motives), but also to cherish it in ourselves; if there were not, in  short, a natural basis of sentiment for utilitarian morality, it might  well happen that this association also, even after it had been implanted  by education, might be analysed away.    But there is this basis of powerful natural sentiment; and this it is  which, when once the general happiness is recognized as the ethical  standard, will constitute the strength of the utilitarian morality. This  firm foundation is that of the social feelings of mankind; the desire to  be in unity with our fellow creatures, which is already a powerful  principle in human nature, and happily one of those which tend to become  stronger, even without express inculcation, from the influences of  advancing civilization. The social state is at once so natural, so  necessary, and so habitual to man, that, except in some unusual  circumstances or by an effort of voluntary abstraction, he never  conceives himself otherwise than as a member of a body; and this  association is riveted more and more, as mankind are further removed  from the state of savage independence. Any condition, therefore, which  is essential to a state of society, becomes more and more an inseparable  part of every person's conception of the state of things which he is  born into, and which is the destiny of a human being. Now, society  between human beings, except in the relation of master and slave, is  manifestly impossible on any other footing than that the interests of  all are to be consulted. Society between equals can only exist on the  understanding that the interests of all are to be regarded equally. And  since in all states of civilization, every person, except an absolute  monarch, has equals, every one is obliged to live on these terms with  somebody; and in every age some advance is made towards a state in which  it will be impossible to live permanently on other terms with anybody.  In this way people grow up unable to conceive as possible to them a  state of total disregard of other people's interests.

Hitherto I  have spoken somewhat slightingly of my uncle; and in his dissipation he  deserved it, for he was both too honest and too simple to shine in that  galaxy of prostitute genius of which Charles II. was the centre. But in  retirement he was no longer the same person, and I do not think that  the elements of human nature could have furnished forth a more amiable  character than Sir William Devereux, presiding at Christmas over the  merriment of his great hall. Good old man! his very defects were what we  loved best in him; vanity was so mingled with good nature that it became  graceful, and we reverenced one the most, while we most smiled at the  other. One peculiarity had he, which the age he had lived in, and his  domestic history, rendered natural enough, viz. an exceeding distaste  to the matrimonial state: early marriages were misery; imprudent  marriages idiotism; and marriage at the best he was wont to say, with  a kindling eye and a heightened colour, marriage at the best--was the  devil. Yet it must not be supposed that Sir William Devereux was an  ungallant man. On the contrary, never did the _beau sexe_ have a  humbler or more devoted servant. As nothing in his estimation was less  becoming to a wise man than matrimony, so nothing was more ornamental  than flirtation. He had the old man's weakness, garrulity, and he told  the wittiest stories in the world, without omitting any thing in them  but the point. This omission did not arise from the want either of  memory or of humour, but solely from a deficiency in the malice natural  to all jesters. He could not persuade his lips to repeat a sarcasm  hurting even the dead or the ungrateful; and when he came to the drop  of gall which should have given zest to the story, the milk of human  kindness broke its barrier despite himself, and washed it away. He was a  fine wreck, a little prematurely broken by dissipation, but not perhaps  the less interesting on that account; tall, and somewhat of the jovial  old English girth, with a face where good nature and good living mingled  their smiles and glow. He wore the garb of twenty years back, and was  curiously particular in the choice of his silk stockings. He was not a  little vain of his leg, and a compliment on that score was always sure  of a gracious reception.           *       *       *       *       *          The Gatherer.

One day he received a  letter by the post, directed to himself, as the _Plumbian_ Professor.  He shook with indignation. What an insult! _Plumbian_ professor!  Leaden professor! Was it meant to insinuate that there was any thing  of a leaden quality in his lectures or writings! While thus irate, a  friend of the professor happened to drop in. He showed him the letter,  and expatiated upon the indignity of the superscription. His friend  endeavoured to convince him that it must be merely a slip of the pen.  In vain.
