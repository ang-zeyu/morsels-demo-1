An English authority gives some excellent directions for calling  upon occasions of congratulation or condolence. He says:    \"Visits of condolence and congratulation must be made about a week  after the event. If you are intimate with the person upon whom you  call, you may ask, in the first case, for admission; if not, it is  better to leave only a card, and make your \"kind inquiries\" of the  servant, who is generally primed in what manner to answer them. In  visits of congratulation you should always go in, and be hearty in  your congratulations. Visits of condolence are terrible  inflictions to both receiver and giver, but they may be made less  so by avoiding, as much as is consistent with sympathy, any  allusion to the past. The receiver does well to abstain from  tears. A lady of my acquaintance, who had lost her husband, was  receiving such a visit in her best crape. She wept profusely for  sometime upon the best broad-hemmed cambric handkerchiefs, and  then turning to her visitor said: 'I am sure that you will be glad  to hear that Mr. B. has left me most comfortably provided for.'  _Hinc illae lachrymae._ Perhaps they would have been more sincere  if he had left her without a penny. At the same time, if you have  not sympathy and heart enough to pump up a little condolence, you  will do better to avoid it, but take care that your conversation  is not too gay. Whatever you may feel you must respect the sorrows  of others.\"    On marriage, cards are sent round to such people as you wish to  keep among your acquaintances, and it is then their part to call  first on the young couple, when within distance.    A lady when calling keeps her parasol in her hand, and is not  required to remove her glove.    No dog, however \"dear or interesting,\" can be admitted to the  drawing-room, and it is bad taste to have one follow you from  home, if you intend to make calls.    It is better for a lady not to have a child with her when paying  calls, unless it is trained to sit silent, or old enough to behave  with quiet propriety.    It is a sign of low-breeding to fidget with the hat, cane or  parasol during a call. They are introduced merely as signs that  the caller is in walking dress, and are not intended, the hat to  be whirled round the top of the cane, the cane to be employed in  tracing out the pattern of the carpet, or the parasol to be tapped  on the teeth, or worse still, sucked.    It is in bad taste for a caller to preface his or her departure by  consulting a watch, remarking, \"Now I must go,\" or insinuating  that the hostess is weary of the visitor. Rise when ready to go,  and express your pleasure at finding your friends at home,  followed by a cordially expressed desire for a speedy meeting  again.    Pelham said he always withdrew when he said something that  produced a sensation, because he knew he must leave such an  impression as would make people wish to see him again.  The lady of the house should always ring when visitors rise to go,  that a servant may be ready to show them out.    When other callers arrive, it is in bad taste to rise at once as  if driven away. Let the first caller watch for a favorable  opportunity to retire gracefully.    If a gentleman calling sees a lady unescorted rise to go, he may  with perfect propriety offer to escort her to her carriage, even  if a stranger, but he must return again to make his own farewell  bow to the hostess.    The most trivial subjects are admissible for a call, and it is not  in good taste to discuss deep interests, political questions or  matters of grave moment.    If strangers are in the room when a caller rises to leave,  courtesy requires only a slight bow in passing.    When calling, etiquette requires that a card be sent up. It will  show that you have called, and if friends are at home, will  prevent any confusion from mispronunciation of your name by the  servant.    When the lady of the house is not at home, a card must be left,  and if there are two or more ladies, the turning down of one  corner of the card signifies that the call was intended for all  the family,    If cards to be left preparatory to leaving town, the initials p.  p. c. (_pour prendre conge_,* or, presents parting compliments),  must be written in the left hand corner. If the departure is a  hurried one, the card may be sent by a servant, but it is in  better taste to leave it in person.    ----  * To take leave.  -----    Cards sent during the illness of any member of the family to whom  they are sent, must be accompanied by verbal inquiries regarding  the patient's health. The same rule applies to the survivors when  cards of condolence are sent.    Cards may be left or sent the day after a ball or large evening  party.    After a dinner party or small social gathering, cards must be left  within the following week. When unable to accept an invitation to  dinner, a call should soon afterwards be made to express regret at  the inability to be present.    Visits of condolence are made within a week after the bereavement,  unless the deceased be one of the immediate family, when a  fortnight may be allowed to intervene. Cards may, however, be left  immediately after the death is known.    The first call of a stranger must be returned within a week.    Married men are not obliged to make calls of ceremony in person.  It is sufficient for their wives to leave their cards with their  own.    Residents in a place make the first call upon any new comers.    If a lady does not wish to receive visitors, her servant must be  instructed to reply \"not at home,\" to callers. This is not meant  to imply that she is out of the house; merely that she is not home  to callers. To say that she is \"engaged\" answers the same purpose,  but such answers must be made upon the first inquiry, for if the  visitor is announced, he or she may conclude the refusal is  intended for that especial call.    It is not necessary, nor is it customary in the city, to offer  refreshments to callers. In the country, especially if the  visitors have come from a distance, it is not only courteous, but  often a positive kindness to do so.    If a stranger come to stay at the house of a friend, those who are  in the habit of visiting at the house should call as soon as  possible, and such calls should be returned at the earliest  practicable opportunity.    A well-bred person should endeavor to be always prepared for  callers. If it is impossible, during the day, to see your friends,  instruct your servant to deny them at the door, but if once within  house, no personal inconvenience should prevent you from  presenting yourself. Illness alone, either your own, or that of  some one requiring your constant attention, can then excuse you.    A lady should avoid keeping callers waiting. If they call before  the hours etiquette has appointed, it is better to see them in the  morning dress than to make them wait for a more elaborate toilet.  If there is any fault, it is their own for intruding at improper  hours.    Persons who do not keep a carriage should not make visits of  ceremony in wet weather. It is ill-bred to enter a drawing-room,  with a handsome carpet upon it, in muddy boots and spattered  garments, to stand a dripping umbrella beside you, or deposit  over-shoes in the hall.    Never resume your seat after having once left it to say adieu.  There is nothing more awkward than to take leave twice. A lady who  is receiving morning visits, may keep some trifling fancy-work in  her hand, if she desires; but drawing, music, writing or any other  absorbing occupation must at once be laid aside.    In receiving many callers at one time, a well-bred lady must  divide her attentions as equally as possible. A _tete-a-tete_  conversation is a gross breach of etiquette, and no one may  receive any especial notice excepting any elderly person.    If, during a call any _contretemps_ occur, shorten your visit.  Your hostess may preserve a smiling serenity while a voice in the  distance proclaims that, \"Johnnie has fallen down the stairs,\" or  \"Mary has set the nursery curtains on fire,\" but you may be  certain she will not resent your departure, even if you have not  been two minutes seated.    If you find yourself intruding upon an early dinner hour, do not  prolong your stay.    A call may be made upon a friend to whom some good fortune has  come, as promotion in service or other happy event, even if he has  not returned the last of your visits.    It is a breach of etiquette, during a call, to draw near to the  fire to warm your hands and feet, unless you are invited by the  mistress of the house to do so. If you are alone in the drawing-  room for a time, while your visit is announced, and then go to the  fire, leave your seat and advance to meet the mistress of the  house as she enters, and then take the seat she points out to you.    In visiting an invalid, never offer to go to the room, but wait  for a invitation to do so.    A gentleman who is a confirmed invalid, may receive the visits of  a lady friend, but under no other circumstances.    Calls made either in person or by card, during an illness of your  own, must be returned as soon as you are able to go abroad again.    It is a breach of etiquette to remove the gloves when making a  formal call.    It is a breach of etiquette to stare round a room when you are  making a call.    In paying visits of condolence, let your dress be subdued. It is  offensive to put on your gayest attire to call upon a friend in  affliction, and equally so to converse upon such subjects as  balls, opera or similar amusements.

But it was not so fascinating, and the dull  sparkle of the moonlight on the water brought no such sensations of  exquisite pleasure, as when the sunshine played over the polished steel  of a corselet on Hawberk's knee. I watched the bats darting and turning  above the water plants in the fountain basin, but their rapid, jerky  flight set my nerves on edge, and I went away again to walk aimlessly to  and fro among the trees.    The artillery stables were dark, but in the cavalry barracks the  officers' windows were brilliantly lighted, and the sallyport was  constantly filled with troopers in fatigue, carrying straw and harness  and baskets filled with tin dishes.    Twice the mounted sentry at the gates was changed while I wandered up and  down the asphalt walk. I looked at my watch. It was nearly time. The  lights in the barracks went out one by one, the barred gate was closed,  and every minute or two an officer passed in through the side wicket,  leaving a rattle of accoutrements and a jingle of spurs on the night air.  The square had become very silent. The last homeless loiterer had been  driven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the car tracks along  Wooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which broke the  stillness was the stamping of the sentry's horse and the ring of his  sabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers' quarters  were still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed before the  bay windows. Twelve o'clock sounded from the new spire of St. Francis  Xavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a figure passed  through the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the salute of the  sentry, and crossing the street entered the square and advanced toward  the Benedick apartment house.    \"Louis,\" I called.    The man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me.    \"Is that you, Hildred?\"    \"Yes, you are on time.\"    I took his offered hand, and we strolled toward the Lethal Chamber.    He rattled on about his wedding and the graces of Constance, and their  future prospects, calling my attention to his captain's shoulder-straps,  and the triple gold arabesque on his sleeve and fatigue cap. I believe I  listened as much to the music of his spurs and sabre as I did to his  boyish babble, and at last we stood under the elms on the Fourth Street  corner of the square opposite the Lethal Chamber. Then he laughed and  asked me what I wanted with him. I motioned him to a seat on a bench  under the electric light, and sat down beside him. He looked at me  curiously, with that same searching glance which I hate and fear so in  doctors. I felt the insult of his look, but he did not know it, and I  carefully concealed my feelings.    \"Well, old chap,\" he inquired, \"what can I do for you?\"    I drew from my pocket the manuscript and notes of the Imperial Dynasty  of America, and looking him in the eye said:    \"I will tell you. On your word as a soldier, promise me to read this  manuscript from beginning to end, without asking me a question. Promise  me to read these notes in the same way, and promise me to listen to what  I have to tell later.\"    \"I promise, if you wish it,\" he said pleasantly. \"Give me the paper,  Hildred.\"    He began to read, raising his eyebrows with a puzzled, whimsical air,  which made me tremble with suppressed anger. As he advanced his, eyebrows  contracted, and his lips seemed to form the word \"rubbish.\"    Then he looked slightly bored, but apparently for my sake read, with an  attempt at interest, which presently ceased to be an effort He started  when in the closely written pages he came to his own name, and when he  came to mine he lowered the paper, and looked sharply at me for a moment  But he kept his word, and resumed his reading, and I let the half-formed  question die on his lips unanswered. When he came to the end and read the  signature of Mr. Wilde, he folded the paper carefully and returned it to  me. I handed him the notes, and he settled back, pushing his fatigue cap  up to his forehead, with a boyish gesture, which I remembered so well in  school. I watched his face as he read, and when he finished I took the  notes with the manuscript, and placed them in my pocket. Then I unfolded  a scroll marked with the Yellow Sign. He saw the sign, but he did not  seem to recognize it, and I called his attention to it somewhat sharply.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I see it. What is it?\"    \"It is the Yellow Sign,\" I said angrily.    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said Louis, in that flattering voice, which  Doctor Archer used to employ with me, and would probably have employed  again, had I not settled his affair for him.    I kept my rage down and answered as steadily as possible, \"Listen, you  have engaged your word?\"    \"I am listening, old chap,\" he replied soothingly.    I began to speak very calmly.    \"Dr. Archer, having by some means become possessed of the secret of the  Imperial Succession, attempted to deprive me of my right, alleging that  because of a fall from my horse four years ago, I had become mentally  deficient. He presumed to place me under restraint in his own house in  hopes of either driving me insane or poisoning me. I have not forgotten  it. I visited him last night and the interview was final.\"    Louis turned quite pale, but did not move. I resumed triumphantly, \"There  are yet three people to be interviewed in the interests of Mr. Wilde and  myself. They are my cousin Louis, Mr. Hawberk, and his daughter  Constance.\"    Louis sprang to his feet and I arose also, and flung the paper marked  with the Yellow Sign to the ground.    \"Oh, I don't need that to tell you what I have to say,\" I cried, with a  laugh of triumph. \"You must renounce the crown to me, do you hear, to  _me_.\"    Louis looked at me with a startled air, but recovering himself said  kindly, \"Of course I renounce the--what is it I must renounce?\"    \"The crown,\" I said angrily.    \"Of course,\" he answered, \"I renounce it. Come, old chap, I'll walk back  to your rooms with you.\"    \"Don't try any of your doctor's tricks on me,\" I cried, trembling with  fury. \"Don't act as if you think I am insane.\"    \"What nonsense,\" he replied. \"Come, it's getting late, Hildred.\"    \"No,\" I shouted, \"you must listen. You cannot marry, I forbid it. Do you  hear? I forbid it. You shall renounce the crown, and in reward I grant  you exile, but if you refuse you shall die.\"    He tried to calm me, but I was roused at last, and drawing my long knife  barred his way.    Then I told him how they would find Dr. Archer in the cellar with his  throat open, and I laughed in his face when I thought of Vance and his  knife, and the order signed by me.    \"Ah, you are the King,\" I cried, \"but I shall be King. Who are you to  keep me from Empire over all the habitable earth! I was born the cousin  of a king, but I shall be King!\"    Louis stood white and rigid before me. Suddenly a man came running up  Fourth Street, entered the gate of the Lethal Temple, traversed the path  to the bronze doors at full speed, and plunged into the death chamber  with the cry of one demented, and I laughed until I wept tears, for I had  recognized Vance, and knew that Hawberk and his daughter were no longer  in my way.    \"Go,\" I cried to Louis, \"you have ceased to be a menace. You will never  marry Constance now, and if you marry any one else in your exile, I will  visit you as I did my doctor last night. Mr. Wilde takes charge of you  to-morrow.\" Then I turned and darted into South Fifth Avenue, and with a  cry of terror Louis dropped his belt and sabre and followed me like the  wind. I heard him close behind me at the corner of Bleecker Street, and I  dashed into the doorway under Hawberk's sign. He cried, \"Halt, or I  fire!\" but when he saw that I flew up the stairs leaving Hawberk's shop  below, he left me, and I heard him hammering and shouting at their door  as though it were possible to arouse the dead.    Mr. Wilde's door was open, and I entered crying, \"It is done, it is done!  Let the nations rise and look upon their King!\" but I could not find Mr.  Wilde, so I went to the cabinet and took the splendid diadem from its  case. Then I drew on the white silk robe, embroidered with the Yellow  Sign, and placed the crown upon my head. At last I was King, King by my  right in Hastur, King because I knew the mystery of the Hyades, and my  mind had sounded the depths of the Lake of Hali. I was King! The first  grey pencillings of dawn would raise a tempest which would shake two  hemispheres. Then as I stood, my every nerve pitched to the highest  tension, faint with the joy and splendour of my thought, without, in the  dark passage, a man groaned.    I seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door. The cat passed me like a  demon, and the tallow dip went out, but my long knife flew swifter than  she, and I heard her screech, and I knew that my knife had found her. For  a moment I listened to her tumbling and thumping about in the darkness,  and then when her frenzy ceased, I lighted a lamp and raised it over my  head. Mr. Wilde lay on the floor with his throat torn open. At first I  thought he was dead, but as I looked, a green sparkle came into his  sunken eyes, his mutilated hand trembled, and then a spasm stretched his  mouth from ear to ear. For a moment my terror and despair gave place to  hope, but as I bent over him his eyeballs rolled clean around in his  head, and he died. Then while I stood, transfixed with rage and despair,  seeing my crown, my empire, every hope and every ambition, my very life,  lying prostrate there with the dead master, _they_ came, seized me  from behind, and bound me until my veins stood out like cords, and my  voice failed with the paroxysms of my frenzied screams. But I still  raged, bleeding and infuriated among them, and more than one policeman  felt my sharp teeth. Then when I could no"]]]
