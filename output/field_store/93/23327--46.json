But while there are some who maintain that the  history of peoples is nothing but the exclusive product of racial  character, there are others who insist that the social conditions of  peoples and individuals are alone determining. The one is as much a  one-sided and incomplete theory as the other. The study of collective  society or of the single individual has resulted in the understanding  that the life of society and of the individual is always the product of  the inextricable net of the anthropological, telluric and social  elements. Hence the influence of the race cannot be ignored in the study  of nations and personalities, although it is not the exclusive factor  which would suffice to explain the criminality of a nation or an  individual. Study, for instance, manslaughter in Italy, and, although  you will find it difficult to isolate one of the factors of criminality  from the network of the other circumstances and conditions that produce  it, yet there are such eloquent instances of the influence of racial  character, that it would be like denying the existence of daylight if  one tried to ignore the influence of the ethnical factor on  criminality.    In Italy there are two currents of criminality, two tendencies which are  almost diametrically opposed to one another. The crimes due to hot blood  and muscle grow in intensity from northern to southern Italy, while the  crimes against property increase from south to north. In northern Italy,  where movable property is more developed, the crime of theft assumes a  greater intensity, while crimes due to conditions of the blood are  decreasing on account of the lesser poverty and the resulting lesser  degeneration of the people. In the south, on the other hand, crimes  against property are less frequent and crimes of blood more frequent.  Still there also are in southern Italy certain cases where criminality  of the blood is less frequent, and you cannot explain this in any other  way than by the influence of racial character. If you take a  geographical map of manslaughter in Italy, you will see that from the  minimum, from Lombardy, Piedmont, and Venice, the intensity increases  until it reaches its maximum in the insular and peninsular extreme of  the south. But even there you will find certain cases in which  manslaughter shows a lesser intensity.    For instance, the province of Benevent is surrounded by other provinces  which show a maximum of crimes due to conditions of blood, while it  registers a smaller number. Naples, again, shows a considerably smaller  number of such cases than the provinces surrounding it, but it has a  greater number of unpremeditated cases of manslaughter. Messina, Catania  and Syracuse have a remarkably smaller number of blood crimes than  Trapani, Girgenti and Palermo. It has been attempted to claim that this  difference in criminality is due to social condition's, because the  agricultural conditions in eastern Sicily are less degrading than those  of Girgenti and Trapani, where the sulphur mines compel the miners to  live miserably. But we should like to ask the following question in  opposition to this idea: Why and in what respect are the agricultural  conditions in some provinces better than in others? This condition is  merely itself a result, not a cause of the first degree.    Since the theory of historical materialism, which I prefer to call  economic determinism, has demonstrated that political, moral and  intellectual phenomena are reactions on the economic conditions of any  time and place, the attempt has been made to interpret this theory very  narrowly and to pretend that the economic condition of a nation is a  primary cause and not determined by any other. For my part, ever since I  have demonstrated the perfect accord between the Marxian and the  Darwinian theories, I have said: Very well, the economic conditions of a  nation explain its political, moral, intellectual conditions, but the  economic condition is in its turn the result of other factors. For  instance, how can the industrialism of England in the nineteenth century  be explained? Take away the coal mines (the telluric environment), and  you could not have the economic conditions of England as they are. For  the economic conditions are a result of favorable or unfavorable  telluric conditions which are acted upon by the intelligence and energy  of a certain race. Catania, Messina, Syracuse, are in a better economic  condition, because they have better geographical conditions and a  different race (of Grecian blood) than the other Sicilian provinces. So  it is in Apulia and Naples, which have likewise a considerable mixture  of Grecian blood. The northern tourists are still attracted by our art  and visit the ruins of Taormina or Pesto, which are the relics of the  Grecian race. And it is the Grecian blood which explains the lesser  frequency of bloody crimes in those provinces. This is therefore  evidently the influence of the race. And I maintain that the same fact  is due in the province of Benevent to the admixture of Langobardian  blood. For the Duchy of Benevent has had an influx of Langobardian  elements since the seventh century. And as we know that the German and  Anglo-Saxon race has the smallest tendency towards bloody crimes, the  beneficial influence of this racial character in Benevent explains  itself. On the other hand, there is much Saracen blood in the western  and southern provinces of Sicily, and this explains the greater number  of bloody crimes there. It is evident that the organic character of the  inhabitants of that island, where you may still see the brutal and  barbarian features of the Saracen by the side of those of the blond,  cool and quiet Norman, contains a transfusion of the blood of diverse  races. But it is also true that wherever a certain race has been  predominant, there its influence is left behind in the individual and  collective life.    Let this be enough so far as the anthropological factor of criminality  is concerned. There are, furthermore, the telluric factors, that is to  say, the physical environment in which we live and to which we pay no  attention. It requires much philosophy, said Rousseau, to note the  things with which we are in daily contact, because the habitual  influence of a thing makes it more difficult to be aware of it. This  applies also to the immediate influence of the physical conditions on  human morality, notwithstanding the spiritualist prejudices which still  weigh upon our daily lives. For instance, if it is claimed in the name  of supernaturalism and psychism that a man is unhappy because he is  vicious, it is equivalent to making a one-sided statement. For it is  just as true to say that a man becomes vicious because he is unhappy.  Want is the strongest poison for the human body and soul. It is the  fountain head of all inhuman and antisocial feeling. Where want spreads  out its wings, there the sentiments of love, of affection, of  brotherhood, are impossible.    Take a look at the figures of the peasant in the far-off arid Campagna,  the little government employee, the laborer, the little shop-keeper.  When work is assured, when living is certain, though poor, then want,  cruel want, is in the distance, and every good sentiment can germinate  and develop in the human heart. The family then lives in a favorable  environment, the parents agree, the children are affectionate. And when  the laborer, a bronzed statue of humanity, returns from, his smoky shop  and meets his white-haired mother, the embodiment of half a century of  immaculate virtue and heroic sacrifices, then he can, tired, but assured  of his daily bread, give room to feelings of affection, and he will  cordially invite his mother to share his frugal meal. But let the same  man, in the same environment, be haunted by the spectre of want and lack  of employment, and you will see the moral atmosphere in his family  changing as from day into night. There is no work, and the laborer comes  home without any wages. The wife, who does not know how to feed the  children, reproaches her husband with the suffering of his family. The  man, having been turned away from the doors of ten offices, feels his  dignity as an honest laborer assailed in the very bosom of his own  family, because he has vainly asked society for honest employment. And  the bonds of affection and union are loosened in that family. Its  members no longer agree. There are too many children, and when the poor  old mother approaches her son, she reads in his dark and agitated mien  the lack of tenderness and feels in her mother heart that her boy,  poisoned by the spectre of want, is perhaps casting evil looks at her  and harboring the unfilial thought: \"Better an open grave in the  cemetery than one mouth more to feed at home!\"    It is true, that want alone is not sufficient to prepare the soil in the  environment of that suffering family for the roots of real crime and to  develop it. Want will weaken the love and mutual respect among the  members of that family, but it will not be strong enough alone to arm  the hands of the man for a matricidal deed, unless he should get into a  pathological mental condition, which is very exceptional and rare. But  the conclusions of the positive school are confirmed in this case as in  any other. In order that crime may develop, it is necessary that  anthropological, social and telluric factors should act together.    We generally forget the conditions of the physical environment in which  we live, because supernatural prejudice tells us that the body is a  beast which we must forget in order to elevate ourselves into a  spiritual life."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#8)"],[1,"his numerous  qualities.    \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind turning out this  afternoon and seeing what you can do with a hard ball--if you can manage  without your little sister.\"    \"I should think the form at this place would be about on a level with  hers. But I don't happen to be playing cricket, as I think I told you.\"    Adair's jaw grew squarer than ever. Mike was wearing a gloomy scowl.    Psmith joined suavely in the dialogue.    \"My dear old comrades,\" he said, \"Don't let us brawl over this matter.  This is a time for the honeyed word, the kindly eye, and the pleasant  smile. Let me explain to Comrade Adair. Speaking for Comrade Jackson and  myself, we should both be delighted to join in the mimic warfare of our  National Game, as you suggest, only the fact is, we happen to be the  Young Archaeologists. We gave in our names last night. When you are  being carried back to the pavilion after your century against  Loamshire--do you play Loamshire?--we shall be grubbing in the hard  ground for ruined abbeys. The old choice between Pleasure and Duty,  Comrade Adair. A Boy's Crossroads.\"    \"Then you won't play?\"    \"No,\" said Mike.    \"Archaeology,\" said Psmith, with a deprecatory wave of the hand, \"will  brook no divided allegiance from her devotees.\"    Adair turned, and walked on.    Scarcely had he gone, when another voice hailed them with precisely the  same question.    \"Both you fellows are going to play cricket, eh?\"    It was a master. A short, wiry little man with a sharp nose and a  general resemblance, both in manner and appearance, to an excitable  bullfinch.    \"I saw Adair speaking to you. I suppose you will both play. I like every  new boy to begin at once. The more new blood we have, the better. We  want keenness here. We are, above all, a keen school. I want every boy  to be keen.\"    \"We are, sir,\" said Psmith, with fervor.    \"Excellent.\"    \"On archaeology.\"    Mr. Downing--for it was no less a celebrity--started, as one who  perceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad.    \"Archaeology!\"    \"We gave in our names to Mr. Outwood last night, sir. Archaeology is a  passion with us, sir. When we heard that there was a society here, we  went singing about the house.\"    \"I call it an unnatural pursuit for boys,\" said Mr. Downing vehemently.  \"I don't like it. I tell you I don't like it. It is not for me to  interfere with one of my colleagues on the staff, but I tell you frankly  that in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy. It gets  him into idle, loafing habits.\"    \"I never loaf, sir,\" said Psmith.    \"I was not alluding to you in particular. I was referring to the  principle of the thing. A boy ought to be playing cricket with other  boys, not wandering at large about the country, probably smoking and  going into low public houses.\"    \"A very wild lot, sir, I fear, the Archaeological Society here,\" sighed  Psmith, shaking his head.    \"If you choose to waste your time, I suppose I can't hinder you. But in  my opinion it is foolery, nothing else.\"    He stumped off.    \"Now _he's_ cross,\" said Psmith, looking after him. \"I'm afraid we're  getting ourselves disliked here.\"    \"Good job, too.\"    \"At any rate, Comrade Outwood loves us. Let's go on and see what sort of  a lunch that large-hearted fossil fancier is going to give us.\"        8    MIKE FINDS OCCUPATION      There was more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when  Mike found himself regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself  with regard to Sedleighan cricket. He began to realize the eternal truth  of the proverb about half a loaf and no bread. In the first flush of his  resentment against his new surroundings he had refused to play cricket.  And now he positively ached for a game. Any sort of a game. An innings  for a Kindergarten _v_. the Second Eleven of a Home of Rest for  Centenarians would have soothed him. There were times, when the sun  shone, and he caught sight of white flannels on a green ground, and  heard the \"plonk\" of bat striking ball, when he felt like rushing to  Adair and shouting, \"I _will_ be good. I was in the Wrykyn team three  years, and had an average of over fifty the last two seasons. Lead me to  the nearest net, and let me feel a bat in my hands again.\"    But every time he shrank from such a climb down. It couldn't be done.    What made it worse was that he saw, after watching behind the nets once  or twice, that Sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of the  game which he had been rash enough to assume that it must be. Numbers do  not make good cricket. They only make the presence of good cricketers  more likely, by the law of averages.    Mike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at Sedleigh.  Adair, to begin with, was a very good bowler indeed. He was not a  Burgess, but Burgess was the only Wrykyn bowler whom, in his three  years' experience of the school, Mike would have placed above him. He  was a long way better than Neville-Smith, and Wyatt, and Milton, and the  others who had taken wickets for Wrykyn.    The batting was not so good, but there were some quite capable men.  Barnes, the head of Outwood's, he who preferred not to interfere with  Stone and Robinson, was a mild, rather timid-looking youth--not unlike  what Mr. Outwood must have been as a boy--but he knew how to keep balls  out of his wicket. He was a good bat of the old plodding type.    Stone and Robinson themselves, that swashbuckling pair, who now treated  Mike and Psmith with cold but consistent politeness, were both fair  batsmen, and Stone was a good slow bowler.    There were other exponents of the game, mostly in Downing's house.    Altogether, quite worthy colleagues even for a man who had been a star  at Wrykyn.           *       *       *       *       *    One solitary overture Mike made during that first fortnight. He did not  repeat the experiment.    It was on a Thursday afternoon, after school. The day was warm, but  freshened by an almost imperceptible breeze. The air was full of the  scent of the cut grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets. This  is the real cricket scent, which calls to one like the very voice of  the game.    Mike, as he sat there watching, could stand it no longer.    He went up to Adair.    \"May I have an innings at this net?\" he asked. He was embarrassed and  nervous, and was trying not to show it. The natural result was that his  manner was offensively abrupt.    Adair was taking off his pads after his innings. He looked up. \"This  net,\" it may be observed, was the first eleven net.    \"What?\" he said.    Mike repeated his request. More abruptly this time, from increased  embarrassment.    \"This is the first eleven net,\" said Adair coldly. \"Go in after Lodge  over there.\"    \"Over there\" was the end net, where frenzied novices were bowling on a  corrugated pitch to a red-haired youth with enormous feet, who looked as  if he were taking his first lesson at the game.    Mike walked away without a word.           *       *       *       *       *    The Archaeological Society expeditions, even though they carried with  them the privilege of listening to Psmith's views of life, proved but a  poor substitute for cricket. Psmith, who had no counterattraction  shouting to him that he ought to be elsewhere, seemed to enjoy them  hugely, but Mike almost cried sometimes from boredom. It was not always  possible to slip away from the throng, for Mr. Outwood evidently looked  upon them as among the very faithful, and kept them by his side.    Mike on these occasions was silent and jumpy, his brow \"sicklied o'er  with the pale cast of care.\" But Psmith followed his leader with the  pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son is showing him  round the garden. Psmith's attitude toward archaeological research  struck a new note in the history of that neglected science. He was  amiable, but patronizing. He patronized fossils, and he patronized  ruins. If he had been confronted with the Great Pyramid, he would have  patronized that.    He seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge.    That this was not altogether a genuine thirst was proved in the third  expedition. Mr. Outwood and his band were pecking away at the site of an  old Roman camp. Psmith approached Mike.    \"Having inspired confidence,\" he said, \"by the docility of our demeanor,  let us slip away, and brood apart for awhile. Roman camps, to be  absolutely accurate, give me the pip. And I never want to see another  putrid fossil in my life. Let us find some shady nook where a man may  lie on his back for a bit.\"    Mike, over whom the proceedings connected with the Roman camp had long  since begun to shed a blue depression, offered no opposition, and they  strolled away down the hill.    Looking back, they saw that the archaeologists were still hard at it.  Their departure had passed unnoticed.    \"A fatiguing pursuit, this grubbing for mementos of the past,\" said  Psmith. \"And, above all, dashed bad for the knees of the trousers. Mine  are like some furrowed field. It's a great grief to a man of refinement,  I can tell you, Comrade Jackson. Ah, this looks a likely spot.\"    They had passed through a gate into the field beyond. At the farther end  there was a brook, shaded by trees and running with a pleasant sound  over pebbles.    \"Thus far,\" said Psmith, hitching up the knees of his trousers, and  sitting down, \"and no farther. We will rest here awhile, and listen to  the music of the brook. In fact, unless you have anything important to  say, I rather think I'll go to sleep. In this busy life of ours these  naps by the wayside are invaluable. Call me in about an hour.\" And  Psmith, heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil has  earned rest, lay down, with his head against a mossy tree stump, and  closed his eyes.    Mike sat on for a few minutes, listening to the water and making  centuries in his mind, and then,"]]]
