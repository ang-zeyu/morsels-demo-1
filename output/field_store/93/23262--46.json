I saw so many of them wretched in the connections  they had formed in weakness and vanity. They seemed so glad to esteem  women whenever they could.    \"'The soft arms of affection,' said one of the most discerning  spirits, 'will not suffice for me, unless on them I see the steel  bracelets of strength.'    \"But early I perceived that men never, in any extreme of despair,  wished to be women. On the contrary, they were ever ready to taunt one  another, at any sign of weakness, with,      \"'Art thou not like the women, who,'--      The passage ends various ways, according to the occasion and rhetoric  of the speaker. When they admired any woman, they were inclined to  speak of her as 'above her sex.' Silently I observed this, and feared  it argued a rooted scepticism, which for ages had been fastening on  the heart, and which only an age of miracles could eradicate. Ever I  have been treated with great sincerity; and I look upon it as a signal  instance of this, that an intimate friend of the other sex said, in a  fervent moment, that I 'deserved in some star to be a man.' He was  much surprised when I disclosed my view of my position and hopes, when  I declared my faith that the feminine side, the side of love, of  beauty, of holiness, was now to have its full chance, and that, if  either were better, it was better now to be a woman; for even the  slightest achievement of good was furthering an especial work of our  time. He smiled incredulously. 'She makes the best she can of it,'  thought he. 'Let Jews believe the pride of Jewry, but I am of the  better sort, and know better.'    \"Another used as highest praise, in speaking of a character in  literature, the words 'a manly woman.'    \"So in the noble passage of Ben Jonson:      'I meant the day-star should not brighter ride,      Nor shed like influence, from its lucent seat;    I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,      Free from that solemn vice of greatness, pride;    I meant each softest virtue there should meet,      Fit in that softer bosom to abide,    Only a learned and a _manly_ soul      I purposed her, that should with even powers    The rock, the spindle, and the shears control      Of destiny, and spin her own free hours.'\"      \"Me thinks,\" said I, \"you are too fastidious in objecting to this.  Jonson, in using the word 'manly,' only meant to heighten the picture  of this, the true, the intelligent fate, with one of the deeper  colors.\"    \"And yet,\" said she, \"so invariable is the use of this word where a  heroic quality is to be described, and I feel so sure that persistence  and courage are the most womanly no less than the most manly  qualities, that I would exchange these words for others of a larger  sense, at the risk of marring the fine tissue of the verse. Read, 'A  heavenward and instructed soul,' and I should be satisfied. Let it not  be said, wherever there is energy or creative genius, 'She has a  masculine mind.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    This by no means argues a willing want of generosity toward Woman. Man  is as generous towards her as he knows how to be.    Wherever she has herself arisen in national or private history, and  nobly shone forth in any form of excellence, men have received her,  not only willingly, but with triumph. Their encomiums, indeed, are  always, in some sense, mortifying; they show too much surprise. \"Can  this be you?\" he cries to the transfigured Cinderella; \"well, I should  never have thought it, but I am very glad. We will tell every one that  you have '_surpassed your sex_.'\"    In every-day life, the feelings of the many are stained with vanity.  Each wishes to be lord in a little world, to be superior at least over  one; and he does not feel strong enough to retain a life-long  ascendency over a strong nature. Only a Theseus could conquer before  he wed the Amazonian queen. Hercules wished rather to rest with  Dejanira, and received the poisoned robe as a fit guerdon. The tale  should be interpreted to all those who seek repose with the weak.    But not only is Man vain and fond of power, but the same want of  development, which thus affects him morally, prevents his  intellectually discerning the destiny of Woman: The boy wants no  woman, but only a girl to play ball with him, and mark his pocket  handkerchief.    Thus, in Schiller's Dignity of Woman, beautiful as the poem is, there  is no \"grave and perfect man,\" but only a great boy to be softened and  restrained by the influence of girls. Poets--the elder brothers of  their race--have usually seen further; but what can you expect of  every-day men, if Schiller was not more prophetic as to what women  must be? Even with Richter, one foremost thought about a wife was that  she would \"cook him something good.\" But as this is a delicate  subject, and we are in constant danger of being accused of slighting  what are called \"the functions,\" let me say, in behalf of Miranda and  myself, that we have high respect for those who \"cook something good,\"  who create and preserve fair order in houses, and prepare therein the  shining raiment for worthy inmates, worthy guests. Only these  \"functions\" must not be a drudgery, or enforced necessity, but a part  of life. Let Ulysses drive the beeves home, while Penelope there piles  up the fragrant loaves; they are both well employed if these be done  in thought and love, willingly. But Penelope is no more meant for a  baker or weaver solely, than Ulysses for a cattle-herd.    The sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate, but prophesy  to one another. In individual instances this happens. Two persons love  in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold.  This is imperfectly or rarely done in the general life. Man has gone  but little way; now he is waiting to see whether Woman can keep step  with him; but, instead of calling but, like a good brother, \"You can  do it, if you only think so,\" or impersonally, \"Any one can do what he  tries to do;\" he often discourages with school-boy brag: \"Girls can't  do that; girls can't play ball.\" But let any one defy their taunts,  break through and be brave and secure, they rend the air with shouts.    This fluctuation was obvious in a narrative I have lately seen, the  story of the life of Countess Emily Plater, the heroine of the last  revolution in Poland. The dignity, the purity, the concentrated  resolve, the calm, deep enthusiasm, which yet could, when occasion  called, sparkle up a holy, an indignant fire, make of this young  maiden the figure I want for my frontispiece. Her portrait is to be  seen in the book, a gentle shadow of her soul. Short was the career.  Like the Maid of Orleans, she only did enough to verify her  credentials, and then passed from a scene on which she was, probably,  a premature apparition.    When the young girl joined the army, where the report of her exploits  had preceded her, she was received in a manner that marks the usual  state of feeling. Some of the officers were disappointed at her quiet  manners; that she had not the air and tone of a stage-heroine. They  thought she could not have acted heroically unless in buskins; had no  idea that such deeds only showed the habit of her mind. Others talked  of the delicacy of her sex, advised her to withdraw from perils and  dangers, and had no comprehension of the feelings within her breast  that made this impossible. The gentle irony of her reply to these  self-constituted tutors (not one of whom showed himself her equal in  conduct or reason), is as good as her indignant reproof at a later  period to the general, whose perfidy ruined all.    But though, to the mass of these men, she was an embarrassment and a  puzzle, the nobler sort viewed her with a tender enthusiasm worthy of  her. \"Her name,\" said her biographer, \"is known throughout Europe. I  paint her character that she may be as widely loved.\"    With pride, he shows her freedom from all personal affections; that,  though tender and gentle in an uncommon degree, there was no room for  a private love in her consecrated life. She inspired those who knew  her with a simple energy of feeling like her own. \"We have seen,\" they  felt, \"a woman worthy the name, capable of all sweet affections,  capable of stern virtue.\"    It is a fact worthy of remark, that all these revolutions in favor of  liberty have produced female champions that share the same traits, but  Emily alone has found a biographer. Only a near friend could have  performed for her this task, for the flower was reared in feminine  seclusion, and the few and simple traits of her history before her  appearance in the field could only have been known to the domestic  circle. Her biographer has gathered them up with a brotherly devotion.    No! Man is not willingly ungenerous. He wants faith and love, because  he is not yet himself an elevated being. He cries, with sneering  scepticism, \"Give us a sign.\" But if the sign appears, his eyes  glisten, and he offers not merely approval, but homage.    The severe nation which taught that the happiness of the race was  forfeited through the fault of a Woman, and showed its thought of what  sort of regard Man owed her, by making him accuse her on the first  question to his God,--who gave her to the patriarch as a handmaid,  and, by the Mosaical law, bound her to allegiance like a serf,--even  they greeted, with solemn rapture, all great and holy women as  heroines, prophetesses, judges in Israel; and, if they made Eve listen  to the serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit. In other  nations it has been the same down to our day. To the Woman who could  conquer a triumph was awarded. And not only those whose strength was  recommended to the heart by association with goodness and beauty, but  those who were bad, if they were steadfast and strong, had their  claims allowed.

Answer me that, sorr.\"    It was Mulvaney who was speaking. The time was one o'clock of a stifling  June night, and the place was the main gate of Fort Amara, most desolate  and least desirable of all fortresses in India. What I was doing there at  that hour is a question which only concerns M'Grath the Sergeant of the  Guard, and the men on the gate.    \"Slape,\" said Mulvaney, \"is a shuparfluous necessity. This gyard'll shtay  lively till relieved.\" He himself was stripped to the waist; Learoyd on  the next bedstead was dripping from the skinful of water which Ortheris,  clad only in white trousers, had just sluiced over his shoulders; and a  fourth private was muttering uneasily as he dozed open-mouthed in the  glare of the great guard-lantern. The heat under the bricked archway was  terrifying.    \"The worrst night that iver I remimber. Eyah! Is all Hell loose this  tide?\" said Mulvaney. A puff of burning wind lashed through the  wicket-gate like a wave of the sea, and Ortheris swore.    \"Are ye more heasy, Jock?\" he said to Learoyd. \"Put yer 'ead between your  legs. It'll go orf in a minute.\"    \"Ah don't care. Ah would not care, but ma heart is plaayin' tivvy-tivvy on  ma ribs. Let me die! Oh, leave me die!\" groaned the huge Yorkshireman, who  was feeling the heat acutely, being of fleshly build.    The sleeper under the lantern roused for a moment and raised himself on  his elbow,--\"Die and be damned then!\" he said. \"_I_'m damned and I can't  die!\"    \"Who's that?\" I whispered, for the voice was new to me.    \"Gentleman born,\" said Mulvaney; \"Corp'ril wan year, Sargint nex'. Red-hot  on his C'mission, but dhrinks like a fish. He'll be gone before the cowld  weather's here. So!\"    He slipped his boot, and with the naked toe just touched the trigger of  his Martini. Ortheris misunderstood the movement, and the next instant the  Irishman's rifle was dashed aside, while Ortheris stood before him, his  eyes blazing with reproof.    \"You!\" said Ortheris. \"My Gawd, _you!_ If it was you, wot would _we_ do?\"    \"Kape quiet, little man,\" said Mulvaney, putting him aside, but very  gently; \"'tis not me, nor will ut be me whoile Dina Shadd's here. I was  but showin' something.\"    Learoyd, bowed on his bedstead, groaned, and the gentleman-ranker sighed  in his sleep. Ortheris took Mulvaney's tendered pouch, and we three smoked  gravely for a space while the dust-devils danced on the glacis and scoured  the red-hot plain.    \"Pop?\" said Ortheris, wiping his forehead.    \"Don't tantalize wid talkin' av dhrink, or I'll shtuff you into your own  breech-block an'--fire you off!\" grunted Mulvaney.    Ortheris chuckled, and from a niche in the veranda produced six bottles of  ginger ale.    \"Where did ye get ut, ye Machiavel?\" said Mulvaney. \"'Tis no bazar pop.\"    \"'Ow do _Hi_ know wot the Orf'cers drink?\" answered Ortheris. \"Arst the  mess-man.\"    \"Ye'll have a Disthrict Coort-martial settin' on ye yet, me son,\" said  Mulvaney, \"but\"--he opened a bottle--\"I will not report ye this time.  Fwhat's in the mess-kid is mint for the belly, as they say, 'specially  whin that mate is dhrink, Here's luck! A bloody war or a--no, we've got  the sickly season. War, thin!\"--he waved the innocent \"pop\" to the four  quarters of Heaven. \"Bloody war! North, East, South, an' West! Jock, ye  quakin' hayrick, come an' dhrink.\"    But Learoyd, half mad with the fear of death presaged in the swelling  veins of his neck, was pegging his Maker to strike him dead, and fighting  for more air between his prayers. A second time Ortheris drenched the  quivering body with water, and the giant revived.    \"An' Ah divn't see thot a mon is i' fettle for gooin' on to live; an' Ah  divn't see thot there is owt for t' livin' for. Hear now, lads! Ah'm  tired--tired. There's nobbut watter i' ma bones, Let me die!\"    The hollow of the arch gave back Learoyd's broken whisper in a bass boom.  Mulvaney looked at me hopelessly, but I remembered how the madness of  despair had once fallen upon Ortheris, that weary, weary afternoon in the  banks of the Khemi River, and how it had been exorcised by the skilful  magician Mulvaney.    \"Talk, Terence!\" I said, \"or we shall have Learoyd slinging loose, and  he'll be worse than Ortheris was. Talk! He'll answer to your voice.\"    Almost before Ortheris had deftly thrown all the rifles of the Guard on  Mulvaney's bedstead, the Irishman's voice was uplifted as that of one in  the middle of a story, and, turning to me, he said--    \"In barricks or out of it, as _you_ say, sorr, an Oirish rig'mint is the  divil an' more. 'Tis only fit for a young man wid eddicated fistesses. Oh  the crame av disruption is an Oirish rig'mint, an' rippin', tearin',  ragin' scattherers in the field av war! My first rig'mint was  Oirish--Faynians an' rebils to the heart av their marrow was they, an'  _so_ they fought for the Widdy betther than most, bein' contrairy--Oirish.  They was the Black Tyrone. You've heard av thim, sorr?\"    Heard of them! I knew the Black Tyrone for the choicest collection of  unmitigated blackguards, dog-stealers, robbers of hen-roosts, assaulters  of innocent citizens, and recklessly daring heroes in the Army List. Half  Europe and half Asia has had cause to know the Black Tyrone--good luck be  with their tattered Colors as Glory has ever been!    \"They _was_ hot pickils an' ginger! I cut a man's head tu deep wid my belt  in the days av my youth, an', afther some circumstances which I will  oblitherate, I came to the Ould Rig'mint, bearin' the character av a man  wid hands an' feet. But, as I was goin' to tell you, I fell acrost the  Black Tyrone agin wan day whin we wanted thim powerful bad, Orth'ris, me  son, fwhat was the name av that place where they sint wan comp'ny av us  an' wan av the Tyrone roun' a hill an' down again, all for to tache the  Paythans something they'd niver learned before? Afther Ghuzni 'twas.\"    \"Don't know what the bloomin' Paythans called it. We call it Silver's  Theayter. You know that, sure!\"    \"Silver's Theatre--so 'twas, A gut betune two hills, as black as a bucket,  an' as thin as a girl's waist. There was over-many Paythans for our  convaynience in the gut, an' begad they called thimselves a Reserve--bein'  impident by natur! Our Scotchies an' lashins av Gurkys was poundin' into  some Paythan rig'mints, I think 'twas. Scotchies an' Gurkys are twins  bekaze they're so onlike, an' they get dhrunk together whin God plazes. As  I was sayin', they sint wan comp'ny av the Ould an wan av the Tyrone to  double up the hill an' clane out the Paythan Reserve. Orf'cers was scarce  in thim days, fwhat with dysintry an' not takin' care av thimselves, an'  we was sint out wid only wan orf'cer for the comp'ny; but he was a Man  that had his feet beneath him, an' all his teeth in their sockuts.\"    \"Who was he?\" I asked,    \"Captain O'Neil--Old Crook--Cruikna-bulleen--him that I tould ye that tale  av whin he was in Burma.[1] Hah! He was a Man. The Tyrone tuk a little  orf'cer bhoy, but divil a bit was he in command, as I'll dimonstrate  presintly. We an' they came over the brow av the hill, wan on each side av  the gut, an' there was that ondacint Reserve waitin' down below like rats  in a pit.      [Footnote 1:     Now first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone     Was Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone.        _The Ballad of Boh Da Thone. _]    \"'Howld on, men,' sez Crook, who tuk a mother's care av us always. 'Rowl  some rocks on thim by way av visitin'-kyards.' We hadn't rowled more than  twinty bowlders, an' the Paythans was beginnin' to swear tremenjus, whin  the little orf'cer bhoy av the Tyrone shqueaks out acrost the  valley:--'Fwhat the devil an' all are you doin', shpoilin' the fun for my  men? Do ye not see they'll stand?'    \"'Faith, that's a rare pluckt wan!' sez Crook. 'Niver mind the rocks, men.  Come along down an' take tay wid thim!'    \"'There's damned little sugar in ut!' sez my rear-rank man; but Crook  heard.    \"'Have ye not all got spoons?' he sez, laughin', an' down we wint as fast  as we cud. Learoyd bein' sick at the Base, he, av coorse, was not there.\"    \"Thot's a lie!\" said Learoyd, dragging his bedstead nearer. \"Ah gotten  _thot_ theer, an' you knaw it, Mulvaney.\" He threw up his arms, and from  the right arm-pit ran, diagonally through the fell of his chest, a thin  white line terminating near the fourth left rib.    \"My mind's goin',\" said Mulvaney, the unabashed. \"Ye were there. Fwhat I  was thinkin' of! Twas another man, av coorse. Well, you'll remimber thin,  Jock, how we an' the Tyrone met wid a bang at the bottom an' got jammed  past all movin' among the Paythans.\"    \"Ow! It _was_ a tight 'ole. I was squeezed till I thought I'd bloomin'  well bust,\" said Ortheris, rubbing his stomach meditatively,    \"'Twas no place for a little man, but _wan_ little man\"--Mulvaney put his  hand on Ortheris's shoulder--\"saved the life av me. There we shtuck, for  divil a bit did the Paythans flinch, an' divil a bit dare we: our business  bein' to clear 'em out. An' the most exthryordinar' thing av all was that  we an' they just rushed into each other's arrums, an' there was no firing  for a long time. Nothin' but knife an' bay'nit when we cud get our hands  free: an' that was not often. We was breast-on to thim, an' the Tyrone was  yelpin' behind av us in a way I didn't see the lean av at first But I knew  later, an' so did the Paythans.    \"'Knee to knee!' sings out Crook, wid a laugh whin the rush av our comin'  into the gut shtopped, an' he was huggin' a hairy great Paythan, neither  bein' able to do "]]]
