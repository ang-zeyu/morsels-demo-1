Enough has been ascertained of the traffic in the districts  through which the London and Birmingham Railway will pass, to remove all  doubt as to an ample return for the necessary outlay.--_Metropolitan_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.      _A Dancing Archbishop_.--Dr. King, Archbishop of Dublin, having invited  several persons of distinction to dine with him, had, amongst a great  variety of dishes, a fine leg of mutton and caper sauce; but the doctor,  who was not fond of butter, and remarkable for preferring a trencher to a  plate, had some of the abovementioned pickle introduced dry for his use;  which, as he was mincing, he called aloud to the company to observe him;  \"I here present you, my lords and gentlemen,\" said he, \"with a sight that  may henceforward serve you to talk of as something curious, namely, that  you saw an Archbishop of Dublin, at fourscore and seven years of age, cut  capers upon a trencher.\"    T.H.           *       *       *       *       *      _Singular Parish_.--In the parish of East Twyford, near Harrow, in the  county of Middlesex, there is only one house, and the farmer who occupies  it is perpetual churchwarden of a church which has no incumbent, and in  which no duty is performed. The parish has been in this state ever since  the time of Queen Elizabeth.    H.S.S.           *       *       *       *       *      _Scandal_.--It is as well not to trust to one's gratitude _after_ dinner.  I have heard many a host libelled by his guests, with his Burgundy yet  reeking on their rascally lips.--_Lord Byron_.           *       *       *       *       *      A lady with a well plumed head dress, being in deep conversation with a  naval officer, one of the company said, \"it was strange to see so fine a  woman _tar'd_ and feathered.\"           *       *       *       *       *      _A Scolding Wife_.--Dr. Casin having heard the famous Thomas Fuller repeat  some verses on a scolding wife, was so delighted with them, as to request  a copy. \"There is no necessity for that,\" said Fuller, \"as you have got  the original.\"           *       *       *       *       *      _Bouts Rimes_ are words or syllables which rhyme, arranged in a particular  order, and are given to a poet with a subject, on which he must write  verses ending in the same rhymes, disposed in the same order. Menage gives  the following account of the origin of this ridiculous conceit. Dulot, (a  poet of the 17th century,) was one day complaining in a large company,  that 300 sonnets had been stolen from him. One of the company expressing  his astonishment at the number, \"Oh,\" said he, \"they are blank sonnets, or  rhymes (_bouts rimes_) of all the sonnets I may have occasion to write.\"  This ludicrous story produced such an effect, that it became a fashionable  amusement to compose blank sonnets, and in 1648, a quarto volume of _bouts  rimes_ was published.           *       *       *       *       *      _Poisoned Arrows_ used in Guiana are not shot from a bow, but blown  through a tube. They are made of the hard substance of the cokarito tree,  and are about a foot long, and the size of a knitting-needle. One end is  sharply pointed, and dipped in the poison of worraia, the other is  adjusted to the cavity of the reed, from which it is to be blown by a roll  of cotton. The reed is several feet in length. A single breath carries the  arrow 30 or 40 yards.           *       *       *       *       *      _Sterling Applause_.--Lord Bolingbroke was so pleased with Barton Booth's  performance of _Cato_, at Drury Lane Theatre, in 1712, that he presented  the actor with fifty guineas from the stage-box--an example which was  immediately followed by Bolingbroke's political opponents.           *       *       *       *       *      _Claret_ has been accused of producing the gout, but without reason.  Persons who drench themselves with Madeira, Port, &c. and indulge in an  occasional debauch of Claret, may indeed be visited in that way; because a  transition from the strong brandied wines to the lighter, is always  followed by a derangement of the digestive organs.           *       *       *       *       *      _Quarantine in America_.--Dr. Richard Bayley is the person to whom New  York is chiefly indebted for its quarantine laws. His death was, however,  by contagion. In August, 1801, Doctor Bayley, in the discharge of his duty  as health physician, enjoined the passengers and crew of an Irish emigrant  ship, afflicted with the ship fever, to go on shore to the rooms and tents  appointed for them, leaving their luggage behind. The next morning, on  going to the hospital, he found that both crew and passengers, well, sick,  and dying, were huddled together in one apartment, where they had passed  the night. He inconsiderately entered this room before it had been  properly ventilated, but remained scarcely a moment, being obliged to  retire by a deadly sickness at the stomach, and violent pain in the head,  with which he was suddenly seized. He returned home, retired to bed, and  in the afternoon of the seventh day following, he expired.           *       *       *       *       *      _Shaving_ is said to have come into use during the reigns of Louis XIII.  and XIV. of France, both of whom ascended the throne without a beard.  Courtiers and citizens then began to shave, in order to look like the king,  and, as France soon took the lead in all matters of fashion on the  continent, shaving became general. It is at best a tedious operation.  Seume, a German author, says, in his journal, \"To-day I threw my powder  apparatus out of the window, when will come the blessed day that I shall  send the shaving apparatus after it.\"           *       *       *       *       *      _Book Morality_.--Dr. Beddoes wrote a history of Isaac Jenkins, which was  intended to impress useful moral lessons on the labouring classes in an  attractive manner. Above 40,000 copies of this work were sold in a short  time.           *       *       *       *       *      _The Bedford Missal_ throws even the costly scrap-books of these times  into the shade. It was made for the celebrated John, Duke of Bedford, (one  of the younger sons of Henry IV.) and contains 59 large, and more than  1,000 small miniature paintings.           *       *       *       *       *      _The Bedford Level_ was drained at an expense of L400,000. by the noble  family of Russell, Earls and Dukes of Bedford, and others; by which means  100,000 acres of good land have been brought into use.           *       *       *       *       *        POPULAR SCIENCE.

A celebrated  physician at length undertook to restore him to sight. The blind man,  however, refused his assistance. \"If I should recover my sight,\" said  he, \"I should be deprived of the love I have for my wife, which alone  renders me happy.\" \"Man of God,\" replied the physician, \"tell me  which is of most consequence to a rational being, the attainment of  happiness or the attainment of truth?\" S.H.    _Honour_.--William the Third having insisted on Lord H----n's giving  him his _honour_ not to fight a man who had given him a box on the  ear, his lordship was obliged seemingly to comply; but as soon us he  was out of the king's presence he fought the man. The king was, at  first, highly incensed at his breaking his word with him, and asked  him how he came to do so, when he had just given him his honour.  \"Sire,\" replied his lordship, \"you were in the wrong to take such a  pledge, for at the time I gave it you, I had no honour to give.\" S.H.    _Doll's Eyes_.--Insignificant as may appear this petty article of  commerce, it is well known to keep in employ several thousand hands,  and goes to show the vast importance of trifles to a country of  decided commercialists. Mr. Osler, an intelligent manufacturer of  Birmingham, gave the following statement before the Committee of the  House of Commons, in 1824. \"Eighteen years ago, on my first journey  to London, a respectable looking man in the city asked me if I could  supply him with doll's eyes, and I was foolish enough to feel half  offended; I thought it derogatory to my new dignity as a manufacturer,  to make doll's eyes. He took me into a room quite as wide, and twice  the length of this, (one of the large rooms for Committees in the  House of Commons,) and we had just room to walk between the stacks,  from the floor to the ceiling, of parts of dolls. He said these are  only the legs and arms, the trunks are below, but I saw enough to  convince me that he wanted a great many eyes; and as the article  appeared quite in my own line of business, I said I would take an  order by way of experiment, and he showed me several specimens. I  copied the order, and on returning to the Tavistock Hotel I found it  amounted to upwards of five hundred pounds.'\" SWAINE.    _Eggs_.--The duty paid on eggs imported at Ramsgate within the last  three months, exceeds the sum of 2,000l.--_(Morning Herald.)_ The  rate of duty is, as stated in our last, 10d. on every 120 eggs.    _The Druids and the Mistletoe_--Pliny, in his _Natural History_, tells  us, \"The Druids held nothing so sacred as the mistletoe of the oak,  as this is very scarce and rarely to be found, when any of it is  discovered, they go with great pomp and ceremony on a certain day to  gather it. When they have got everything in readiness under the oak,  both for the sacrifice and the banquet, which they make on this great  festival, they begin by tying two white bulls to it by the horns, then  one of the Druids, clothed in white, mounts the tree, and with a knife  of gold, cuts the mistletoe, which is received in a white sagum; this  done, they proceed to their sacrifices and feastings.\" This festival  is said to have been kept as near as the age of the moon permitted  to the 10th of March, which was their New Year's Day. The common  mistletoe was the golden bough of Virgil, and was Aenea's passport to  the infernal regions. P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      SPIRIT OF NEW BOOKS.
