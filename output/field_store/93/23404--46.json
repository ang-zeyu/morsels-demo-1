From the  Alsatian Flitte there escaped an oath accompanied by a slight smack of  the tongue. The chin of Flachs, the Preacher-at-Early-Service, grew  downward into a regular beard.    The City Councillors could hear several softly ejaculated obituaries  referring to the late Kabel under the name of scamp, fool, infidel,  etc. But the officiating Burgomaster waved his hand, the Attorney of  the Royal Treasury and the Bookseller again bent all the elastic steel  springs of their faces as if setting a trap, and the Burgomaster  continued to read, although with enforced seriousness.    \"THIRD CLAUSE    I make an exception of the present house in Dog Street which, after  this my third clause, shall, just as it stands, devolve upon and  belong to that one of my seven above-named relatives, who first,  before the other six rivals, can in one half hour's time (to be  reckoned from the reading of the Clause) shed one or two tears over  me, his departed uncle, in the presence of an estimable magistrate who  shall record the same. If, however, all eyes remain dry, then the  house likewise shall fall to the exclusive heir whom I am about to  name.\"    Here the Burgomaster closed the will, remarked that the condition was  certainly unusual but not illegal, and the court must adjudge the  house to the first one who wept. With which he placed his watch, which  pointed to half-past eleven, on the office-table, and sat himself  quietly down in order in his capacity of executor to observe, together  with the whole court, who should first shed the desired tear over the  testator. It cannot fairly be assumed that, as long as the earth has  stood, a more woe-begone and muddled congress ever met upon it than  this one composed of seven dry provinces assembled together, as it  were, in order to weep. At first some precious minutes were spent  merely in confused wondering and in smiling; the congress had been  placed too suddenly in the situation of the dog who, when about to  rush angrily at his enemy, heard the latter call out: Beg!--and who  suddenly got upon his hind legs and begged, showing his teeth. From  cursing they had been pulled up too quickly into weeping.    Every one realized that genuine emotion was not to be thought of;  downpours do not come quite so much on the gallop; such sudden baptism  of the eyes was out of the question; but in twenty-six minutes  something might happen.    The merchant Neupeter asked if it were not an accursed business and a  foolish joke on the part of a sensible man, and he refused to lend  himself to it; but the thought that a house might swim into his purse  on a tear caused him a peculiar irritation of the glands, which made  him look like a sick lark to whom a clyster is being applied with an  oiled pinhead--the house being the head.    The Attorney of the Royal Treasury Knol screwed up his face like a  poor workman, whom an apprentice is shaving and scraping on a Saturday  evening by the light of a shoemaker's candle; he was furiously angry  at the misuse made of the title \"Will\" and quite near to shedding  tears of rage.    The crafty Bookseller Passvogel at once quietly set about the matter  in hand; he hastily went over in his mind all the touching things  which he was publishing at his own expense or on commission, and from  which he hoped to brew something; he looked the while like a dog that  is slowly licking off the emetic which the Parisian veterinary, Demet,  had smeared on his nose; it would evidently be some time before the  desired effect would take place.    Flitte from Alsace danced around in the Burgomaster's office, looked  laughingly at all the serious faces and swore he was not the richest  among them, but not for all Strasburg and Alsace besides was he  capable of weeping over such a joke.    At last the Police-Inspector looked very significantly at him and  declared: In case Monsieur hoped by means of laughter to squeeze the  desired drops out of the well-known glands and out of the Meibomian,  the caruncle, and others, and thus thievishly to cover himself with  this window-pane moisture, he wished to remind him that he could gain  just as little by it as if he should blow his nose and try to profit  by that, as in the latter case it was well known that more tears  flowed from the eyes through the _ductus nasalis_ than were shed in  any church-pew during a funeral sermon. But the Alsatian assured him  he was only laughing in fun and not with serious intentions.    The Inspector for his part tried to drive something appropriate into  his eyes by holding them wide open and staring fixedly.    The Preacher-at-Early-Service Flachs looked like a Jew beggar riding a  runaway horse. Meanwhile his heart, which was already overcast with  the most promising sultry clouds caused by domestic and  church-troubles, could have immediately drawn up the necessary water,  as easily as the sun before bad weather, if only the floating-house  navigating toward him had not always come between as a much too  cheerful spectacle, and acted as a dam.    The Consistorial Councillor had learned to know his own nature from  New Year's and funeral sermons, and was positive that he himself would  be the first to be moved if only he started to make a moving address  to others. When therefore he saw himself and the others hanging so  long on the drying-line, he stood up and said with dignity: Every one  who had read his printed works knew for a certainty that he carried a  heart in his breast, which needed to repress such holy tokens as tears  are--so as not thereby to deprive any fellowman of something--rather  than laboriously to draw them to the surface with an ulterior motive.  \"This heart has already shed them, but in secret, for Kabel was my  friend,\" he said, and looked around.    He noticed with pleasure that all were sitting there as dry as wooden  corks; at this special moment crocodiles, stags, elephants, witches,  ravens[10] could have wept more easily than the heirs, so disturbed  and enraged were they by Glanz. Flachs was the only one who had a  secret inspiration. He hastily summoned to his mind Kabel's charities  and the mean clothes and gray hair of the women who formed his  congregation at the early-service, Lazarus with his dogs, and his own  long coffin, and also the beheading of various people, Werther's  Sorrows, a small battlefield, and himself--how pitifully here in the  days of his youth he was struggling and tormenting himself over the  clause of the will--just three more jerks of the pump-handle and he  would have his water and the house.    \"O Kabel, my Kabel!\" continued Glanz, almost weeping for joy at the  prospect of the approaching tears of sorrow. \"When once beside your  loving heart covered with earth my heart too shall mol--\"    \"I believe, honored gentlemen,\" said Flachs mournfully, arising and  looking around, his eyes brimming over, \"I am weeping.\" After which he  sat down again and let them flow more cheerfully; he had feathered his  nest. Under the eyes of the other heirs he had snatched away the  prize-house from Glanz, who now extremely regretted his exertions,  since he had quite uselessly talked away half of his appetite. The  emotion of Flachs was placed on record and the house in Dog Street was  adjudged to him for good and all. The Burgomaster was heartily glad to  see the poor devil get it. It was the first time in the principality  of Haslau that the tears of a school-master and teacher-of-the-church  had been metamorphosed, not like those of the Heliades into light  amber, which incased an insect, but like those of the goddess Freya,  into gold. Glanz congratulated Flachs, and gayly drew his attention to  the fact that perhaps he, Glanz, had helped to move him. The rest drew  aside, by their separation accentuating their position on the dry road  from that of Flachs on the wet; all, however, remained intent upon the  rest of the will.    Then the reading of it was continued.          _WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT_           *       *       *       *       *    SCHILLER AND THE PROCESS OF HIS INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT    From the _Introduction to the Correspondence of Schiller and  W. von Humboldt_ (1830)    TRANSLATED BY FRANCES H. KING    Schiller's poetic genius showed itself in his very first productions.  In spite of all their defects in form, in spite of many things which  to the mature artist seemed absolutely crude, _The Robbers_ and  _Fiesko_ gave evidence of remarkable inherent power. His genius  later betrayed itself in the longing for poetry, as for the native  atmosphere of his spirit, which longing constantly breaks out in his  varied philosophical and historical labors and is often hinted at in  his letters to me. It finally revealed itself in virile power and  refined purity in those dramas which will long remain the pride and  the renown of the German stage.    This poetic genius, however, is most closely wedded, in all its height  and depth, to thought; it manifests itself, in fact, in an  intellectuality which by analysis would separate everything into its  parts, and then by combination would unite all in one complete whole.  In this lies Schiller's peculiar individuality. He demanded of poetry  more profundity of thought and forced it to submit to a more rigid  intellectual unity than it had ever had before. This he did in a  two-fold manner--by binding it into a more strictly artistic form, and  by treating every poem in such a way that its subject-matter readily  broadened its individuality until it expressed a complete idea.    It is upon these peculiarities that the excellence which characterizes  Schiller as a writer rests. It is because of them that, in order to  bring out the greatest and best of which he was capable, he needed a  certain amount of time before his completely developed individuality,  to which his poetic genius was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12063"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

It was carried by  common consent that these _must_ be the Paley arms; they were painted on  the carriage, and looked very handsome. The carriage went on very well with  them; and it was not till six months afterwards that we found out that the  tankard had been _bought at a sale_!\"    He told me, \"when I wanted to write any thing particularly well,--to do  better than ordinary,--I used to order a post-chaise and go to Longtown; it  is the first stage from Carlisle towards the north; there is a comfortable,  quiet inn there. I asked for a room to myself; there then I was, safe from  the bustle and trouble of a family; and there I remained as long as I  liked, or till I had finished what I was about.\" I said, \"That is a very  curious anecdote;\" and I said it in a tone which, from a certain change in  his countenance, I believe to have set him on musing how this anecdote  would appear in the history of his life. Paley took his rides on horseback  occasionally, but always alone, without the attendance even of a servant.  \"I am so bad a horseman, that if any man on horseback was to come near me  when I am riding, I should certainly have a fall; company would take off my  attention, and I have need of all I can command to manage my horse and keep  my seat; I have got a horse, the quietest creature that ever lived, one  that at Carlisle used to be covered with children from the ears to the  tail.\" Understanding all this, and seeing him gambadoing on the  race-course, I turned my horse's head another way. \"I saw what you meant  this morning; it was very considerate of you; I am much obliged to you.\"  Paley was too careful of petty expenses, as is frequently the case with  those who have had but narrow incomes in early life. He kept a sufficiently  handsome establishment as subdean, but he was stingy. A plentiful fall of  snow took place during an evening party at the precentors's; two of Mr.  Subdean's daughters were there; he showed great anxiety on account of the  necessity that seemed to have arisen of sending them home in a sedan-chair;  taking the advice of several of the company, whether such necessity really  and inevitably existed, he said to me, \"It is only next door.\" \"The houses  touch,\" said I, \"but it is a long round to your door; the length of both  houses and then through the garden in front of your house.\" He consulted  the precentor, who, to put the matter in a right point of view, cried out,  \"Let the girls have a chair; it is only three-pence a piece.\"    He preached a sermon at Lincoln for the benefit of a charity school. In the  course of this sermon he related, in familiar but sufficiently dignified  language, a story of a man who, giving evidence on a trial respecting some  prescriptive right claimed by the trustees of the charity, was browbeaten  by the questioning counsel:--\"I suppose the fact to which you swear  happened when you were a charity boy, and used to go to school there?\" The  witness calmly replied, \"I _was_ a charity boy; and all the good that has  befallen me in life has arisen from the education I received at that  school.\" Paley drew hence an argument in favour of the institution for  which he pleaded. The whole discourse pleased his auditors, and a  deputation waited on him to request he would print it. \"Gentlemen, I thank  you for the compliment; but I must give the same answer that I have given  on other like occasions; and that answer is--The tap is out.\" \"The  Archbishop of York,\" said he, speaking of a late primate, \"preached one day  at Carlisle; I was present, and felt muzzy and half asleep; when on a  sudden I was roused, and began to prick up my ears; and what should I hear  but a whole page of one of my own books quoted word for word; and this  without the least acknowledgment, though it was a _white bear_; a passage  that is often quoted and well known.\" \"Now,\" said Dr. Milner, Dean of  Carlisle, who related the anecdote, \"guess what inference Paley drew from  this plagiarism. No; if that court were full of people, not one of them  would be able to guess: it was this--I suppose the archbishop's wife makes  his grace's sermons for him.\"           *       *       *       *       *      The city has always been the province for satire; and the wits of King  Charles's time jested upon nothing else during his whole reign.--_Addison_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.

The king  perceived and noticed it. \"Yes, Sire,\" answered the general, \"I do weep for  Napoleon; and you will excuse it, for to him I owe every thing in the  world, even the honour of now serving your majesty, since it was he that  made me what I am!\" The king, in an elevated tone of voice, replied,  \"General, I do but esteem you the more.
