At the same time a snake, gayly striped with black and  yellow, glided out from the bank, and writhed across to the other side;  and a small stagnant pool into which my foot had inadvertently pushed a  stone was instantly alive with a congregation of black tadpoles.    \"Any chance for a bath, where you are?\" called out Shaw, from a  distance.    The answer was not encouraging. I retreated through the willows, and  rejoining my companion, we proceeded to push our researches in company.  Not far on the right, a rising ground, covered with trees and bushes,  seemed to sink down abruptly to the water, and give hope of better  success; so toward this we directed our steps. When we reached the place  we found it no easy matter to get along between the hill and the water,  impeded as we were by a growth of stiff, obstinate young birch-trees,  laced together by grapevines. In the twilight, we now and then, to  support ourselves, snatched at the touch-me-not stem of some ancient  sweet-brier. Shaw, who was in advance, suddenly uttered a somewhat  emphatic monosyllable; and looking up I saw him with one hand grasping a  sapling, and one foot immersed in the water, from which he had forgotten  to withdraw it, his whole attention being engaged in contemplating the  movements of a water-snake, about five feet long, curiously checkered  with black and green, who was deliberately swimming across the pool.  There being no stick or stone at hand to pelt him with, we looked at him  for a time in silent disgust; and then pushed forward. Our perseverence  was at last rewarded; for several rods farther on, we emerged upon a  little level grassy nook among the brushwood, and by an extraordinary  dispensation of fortune, the weeds and floating sticks, which elsewhere  covered the pool, seemed to have drawn apart, and left a few yards of  clear water just in front of this favored spot. We sounded it with a  stick; it was four feet deep; we lifted a specimen in our cupped hands;  it seemed reasonably transparent, so we decided that the time for action  was arrived. But our ablutions were suddenly interrupted by ten  thousand punctures, like poisoned needles, and the humming of myriads  of over-grown mosquitoes, rising in all directions from their native mud  and slime and swarming to the feast. We were fain to beat a retreat with  all possible speed.    We made toward the tents, much refreshed by the bath which the heat of  the weather, joined to our prejudices, had rendered very desirable.    \"What's the matter with the captain? look at him!\" said Shaw. The  captain stood alone on the prairie, swinging his hat violently around  his head, and lifting first one foot and then the other, without moving  from the spot. First he looked down to the ground with an air of  supreme abhorrence; then he gazed upward with a perplexed and indignant  countenance, as if trying to trace the flight of an unseen enemy. We  called to know what was the matter; but he replied only by execrations  directed against some unknown object. We approached, when our ears were  saluted by a droning sound, as if twenty bee-hives had been overturned  at once. The air above was full of large black insects, in a state of  great commotion, and multitudes were flying about just above the tops of  the grass blades.    \"Don't be afraid,\" called the captain, observing us recoil. \"The brutes  won't sting.\"    At this I knocked one down with my hat, and discovered him to be no  other than a \"dorbug\"; and looking closer, we found the ground thickly  perforated with their holes.    We took a hasty leave of this flourishing colony, and walking up  the rising ground to the tents, found Delorier's fire still glowing  brightly. We sat down around it, and Shaw began to expatiate on the  admirable facilities for bathing that we had discovered, and recommended  the captain by all means to go down there before breakfast in the  morning. The captain was in the act of remarking that he couldn't have  believed it possible, when he suddenly interrupted himself, and clapped  his hand to his cheek, exclaiming that \"those infernal humbugs were at  him again.\" In fact, we began to hear sounds as if bullets were humming  over our heads. In a moment something rapped me sharply on the forehead,  then upon the neck, and immediately I felt an indefinite number of sharp  wiry claws in active motion, as if their owner were bent on pushing his  explorations farther. I seized him, and dropped him into the fire.  Our party speedily broke up, and we adjourned to our respective tents,  where, closing the opening fast, we hoped to be exempt from invasion.  But all precaution was fruitless. The dorbugs hummed through the tent,  and marched over our faces until day-light; when, opening our blankets,  we found several dozen clinging there with the utmost tenacity. The  first object that met our eyes in the morning was Delorier, who seemed  to be apostrophizing his frying-pan, which he held by the handle at  arm's length. It appeared that he had left it at night by the fire; and  the bottom was now covered with dorbugs, firmly imbedded. Multitudes  beside, curiously parched and shriveled, lay scattered among the ashes.    The horses and mules were turned loose to feed. We had just taken our  seats at breakfast, or rather reclined in the classic mode, when an  exclamation from Henry Chatillon, and a shout of alarm from the captain,  gave warning of some casualty, and looking up, we saw the whole band  of animals, twenty-three in number, filing off for the settlements, the  incorrigible Pontiac at their head, jumping along with hobbled feet,  at a gait much more rapid than graceful. Three or four of us ran to cut  them off, dashing as best we might through the tall grass, which was  glittering with myriads of dewdrops. After a race of a mile or more,  Shaw caught a horse. Tying the trail-rope by way of bridle round the  animal's jaw, and leaping upon his back, he got in advance of the  remaining fugitives, while we, soon bringing them together, drove them  in a crowd up to the tents, where each man caught and saddled his own.  Then we heard lamentations and curses; for half the horses had broke  their hobbles, and many were seriously galled by attempting to run in  fetters.    It was late that morning before we were on the march; and early in the  afternoon we were compelled to encamp, for a thunder-gust came up and  suddenly enveloped us in whirling sheets of rain. With much ado, we  pitched our tents amid the tempest, and all night long the thunder  bellowed and growled over our heads. In the morning, light peaceful  showers succeeded the cataracts of rain, that had been drenching us  through the canvas of our tents. About noon, when there were some  treacherous indications of fair weather, we got in motion again.    Not a breath of air stirred over the free and open prairie; the clouds  were like light piles of cotton; and where the blue sky was visible, it  wore a hazy and languid aspect. The sun beat down upon us with a sultry  penetrating heat almost insupportable, and as our party crept slowly  along over the interminable level, the horses hung their heads as  they waded fetlock deep through the mud, and the men slouched into  the easiest position upon the saddle. At last, toward evening, the old  familiar black heads of thunderclouds rose fast above the horizon, and  the same deep muttering of distant thunder that had become the ordinary  accompaniment of our afternoon's journey began to roll hoarsely over  the prairie. Only a few minutes elapsed before the whole sky was densely  shrouded, and the prairie and some clusters of woods in front assumed a  purple hue beneath the inky shadows. Suddenly from the densest fold of  the cloud the flash leaped out, quivering again and again down to the  edge of the prairie; and at the same instant came the sharp burst and  the long rolling peal of the thunder. A cool wind, filled with the smell  of rain, just then overtook us, leveling the tall grass by the side of  the path.    \"Come on; we must ride for it!\" shouted Shaw, rushing past at full  speed, his led horse snorting at his side. The whole party broke into  full gallop, and made for the trees in front. Passing these, we found  beyond them a meadow which they half inclosed. We rode pell-mell upon  the ground, leaped from horseback, tore off our saddles; and in a moment  each man was kneeling at his horse's feet. The hobbles were adjusted,  and the animals turned loose; then, as the wagons came wheeling rapidly  to the spot, we seized upon the tent-poles, and just as the storm broke,  we were prepared to receive it. It came upon us almost with the darkness  of night; the trees, which were close at hand, were completely shrouded  by the roaring torrents of rain.    We were sitting in the tent, when Delorier, with his broad felt hat  hanging about his ears, and his shoulders glistening with rain, thrust  in his head.    \"Voulez-vous du souper, tout de suite? I can make a fire, sous la  charette--I b'lieve so--I try.\"    \"Never mind supper, man; come in out of the rain.\"    Delorier accordingly crouched in the entrance, for modesty would not  permit him to intrude farther.    Our tent was none of the best defense against such a cataract. The  rain could not enter bodily, but it beat through the canvas in a fine  drizzle, that wetted us just as effectively. We sat upon our saddles  with faces of the utmost surliness, while the water dropped from the  vizors of our caps, and trickled down our cheeks. My india-rubber cloak  conducted twenty little rapid streamlets to the ground; and Shaw's  blanket-coat was saturated like a sponge. But what most concerned us  was the sight of several puddles of water rapidly accumulating; one  in particular, that was gathering around the tent-pole, threatened  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#8)"],[1," certain  postures of the body (standing, inclination, kneeling, prostration) with  the face towards Mecca. This last particular and the language of the  Revelation are the Arabian elements of the service, which is for the rest  an imitation of Jewish and Christian rituals, so far as Mohammed knew them.  There was no sacrament, consequently no priest to administer it; Islam has  always been the lay religion _par excellence_. Teaching and exhortation are  the only spiritual help that the pious Mohammedan wants, and this simple  care of souls is exercised without any ordination or consecration.    Fasting, for a month if possible, and longer if desired, was also an  integral part of religious life and, by showing disregard of earthly joys,  a proof of faith in Allah's promises for the world to come. Almsgiving,  recommended above all other virtues, was not only to be practised in  obedience to Allah's law and in faith in retribution, but it was to testify  contempt of all earthly possessions which might impede the striving after  eternal happiness. Later, Mohammed was compelled, by the need of a public  fund and the waning zeal of the faithful as their numbers increased, to  regulate the practice of this virtue and to exact certain minima as taxes  (_zakat_).    When Mohammed, taking his stand as opposed to Judaism and Christianity,  had accentuated the Arabian character of his religion, the Meccan rites of  pagan origin were incorporated into Islam; but only after the purification  required by monotheism. From that time forward the yearly celebration of  the Hajj was among the ritual duties of the Moslim community.    In the first years of the strife yet another duty was most emphatically  impressed on the Faithful; _jihad, i.e._, readiness to sacrifice life and  possessions for the defence of Islam, understood, since the conquest of  Mecca in 630, as the extension by force of arms of the authority of the  Moslim state, first over the whole of Arabia, and soon after Mohammed's  death over the whole world, so far as Allah granted His hosts the victory.    For the rest, the legislative revelations regulated only such points as had  become subjects of argument or contest in Mohammed's lifetime, or such as  were particularly suggested by that antithesis of paganism and revelation,  which had determined Mohammed's prophetical career. Gambling and wine were  forbidden, the latter after some hesitation between the inculcation of  temperance and that of abstinence. Usury, taken in the sense of requiring  any interest at all upon loans, was also forbidden. All tribal feuds with  their consequences had henceforward to be considered as non-existent, and  retaliation, provided that the offended party would not agree to accept  compensation, was put under the control of the head of the community.  Polygamy and intercourse of master and female slave were restricted; the  obligations arising from blood-relationship or ownership were regulated.  These points suffice to remind us of the nature of the Qoranic regulations.  Reference to certain subjects in this revealed law while others were  ignored, did not depend on their respective importance to the life of the  community, but rather on what happened to have been suggested by the events  in Mohammed's lifetime. For Mohammed knew too well how little qualified he  was for legislative work to undertake it unless absolutely necessary.    This rough sketch of what Islam meant when it set out to conquer the world,  is not very likely to create the impression that its incredibly rapid  extension was due to its superiority over the forms of civilization which  it supplanted. Lammens's assertion, that Islam was the Jewish religion  simplified according to Arabic wants and amplified by some Christian and  Arabic traditions, contains a great deal of truth, if only we recognize the  central importance for Mohammed's vocation and preaching of the Christian  doctrine of Resurrection and judgment. This explains the large number of  weak points that the book of Mohammed's revelations, written down by his  first followers, offered to Jewish and Christian polemics. It was easy for  the theologians of those religions to point out numberless mistakes in the  work of the illiterate Arabian prophet, especially where he maintained that  he was repeating and confirming the contents of their Bible. The Qoranic  revelations about Allah's intercourse with men, taken from apocryphal  sources, from profane legends like that of Alexander the Great, sometimes  even created by Mohammed's own fancy--such as the story of the prophet  Salih, said to have lived in the north of Arabia, and that of the prophet  Hud, supposed to have lived in the south; all this could not but give them  the impression of a clumsy caricature of true tradition. The principal  doctrines of Synagogue and Church had apparently been misunderstood, or  they were simply denied as corruptions.    The conversion to Islam, within a hundred years, of such nations as the  Egyptian, the Syrian, and the Persian, can hardly be attributed to anything  but the latent talents, the formerly suppressed energy of the Arabian race  having found a favourable soil for its development; talents and energy,  however, not of a missionary kind. If Islam is said to have been from its  beginning down to the present day, a missionary religion,[1] then \"mission\"  is to be taken here in a quite peculiar sense, and special attention must  be given to the preparation of the missionary field by the Moslim armies,  related by history and considered as most important by the Mohammedans  themselves.    [Footnote 1: With extraordinary talent this thesis has been defended by  Professor T.W. Arnold in the above quoted work, _The Preaching of Islam_,  which fully deserves the attention also of those who do not agree with the  writer's argument. Among the many objections that may be raised against  Prof. Arnold's conclusion, we point to the undeniable fact, that the Moslim  scholars of all ages hardly speak of \"mission\" at all, and always treat the  extension of the true faith by holy war as one of the principal duties of  the Moslim community.]    Certainly, the nations conquered by the Arabs under the first khalifs were  not obliged to choose between living as Moslims or dying as unbelievers.  The conquerors treated them as Mohammed had treated Jews and Christians in  Arabia towards the end of his life, and only exacted from them submission  to Moslim authority. They were allowed to adhere to their religion,  provided they helped with their taxes to fill the Moslim exchequer. This  rule was even extended to such religions as that of the Parsis, although  they could not be considered as belonging to the \"People of Scripture\"  expressly recognized in the Qoran. But the social condition of these  subjects was gradually made so oppressive by the Mohammedan masters, that  rapid conversions in masses were a natural consequence; the more natural  because among the conquered nations intellectual culture was restricted to  a small circle, so that after the conquest their spiritual leaders lacked  freedom of movement. Besides, practically very little was required from the  new converts, so that it was very tempting to take the step that led to  full citizenship.    No, those who in a short time subjected millions of non-Arabs to the state  founded by Mohammed, and thus prepared their conversion, were no apostles.  They were generals whose strategic talents would have remained hidden but  for Mohammed, political geniuses, especially from Mecca and Taif, who,  before Islam, would have excelled only in the organization of commercial  operations or in establishing harmony between hostile families. Now they  proved capable of uniting the Arabs commanded by Allah, a unity still many  a time endangered during the first century by the old party spirit; and of  devising a division of labour between the rulers and the conquered which  made it possible for them to control the function of complicated machines  of state without any technical knowledge.    Moreover, several circumstances favoured their work; both the large realms  which extended north of Arabia, were in a state of political decline;  the Christians inhabiting the provinces that were to be conquered first,  belonged, for the larger part, to heretical sects and were treated by the  orthodox Byzantines in such a way that other masters, if tolerant, might be  welcome. The Arabian armies consisted of hardened Bedouins with few wants,  whose longing for the treasures of the civilized world made them more ready  to endure the pressure of a discipline hitherto unknown to them.    The use that the leaders made of the occasion commands our admiration;  although their plan was formed in the course and under the influence of  generally unforeseen events. Circumstances had changed Mohammed the Prophet  into Mohammed the Conqueror; and the leaders, who continued the conqueror's  work, though not driven by fanaticism or religious zeal, still prepared the  conversion of millions of men to Islam.    It was only natural that the new masters adopted, with certain  modifications, the administrative and fiscal systems of the conquered  countries. For similar reasons Islam had to complete its spiritual store  from the well-ordered wealth of that of its new adherents. Recent research  shows most clearly, that Islam, in after times so sharply opposed to other  religions and so strongly armed against foreign influence, in the first  century borrowed freely and simply from the \"People of Scripture\" whatever  was not evidently in contradiction to the Qoran. This was to be expected;  had not Mohammed from the very beginning referred to the \"people of the  Book\" as \"those who know\"? When painful experience induced him afterwards  to accuse them of corruption of their Scriptures, this attitude  necessitated a certain criticism but not rejection of their"]]]
