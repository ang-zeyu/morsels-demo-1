Twenty-one Egyptian orderlies do the sanitary work of the camp; serious  cases are sent to the English hospital at Alexandria. A Turkish  Surgeon-Major, Dr. Ibrahim, interned at the camp, is present at  operations performed upon his Ottoman comrades in the hospital. He  expressed himself as entirely satisfied with the care bestowed upon  them.    The infirmary contains 12 iron bedsteads, with wool mattresses and  blankets. The consulting room is well fitted up, the cupboards  abundantly supplied with drugs. An isolation ward accommodates  infectious cases in the incubation stage. Bathrooms reserved for the  patients adjoin the infirmary, and there is a kitchen service for  preparing special diet.    Officers troubled by their teeth are taken to a dentist in Alexandria.    The prisoners' garments and bedding are sterilised in a special  apparatus.    All new arrivals pass 14 days in quarantine, in special quarters in one  of the sections of the camp. They are permitted to join their comrades  only when it is certain that they are free from any contagious malady.  At present 36 officers and 34 orderlies are in quarantine.      _Illnesses and Deaths_-All officers imprisoned at Sidi Bishr having been  vaccinated against smallpox, typhoid, and cholera, there are no  epidemics in the camp. Three to five officers come forward each morning  when the doctor makes his rounds. There are perhaps 6 light cases of  malaria weekly, 3 to 5 cases of bacillic dysentery every month, treated  with serum; 1 case of more serious dysentery was sent away to the  English Hospital in Alexandria. In summer there are some mild cases of  diarrhoea. There were 3 cases of trachoma among the officers' orderlies.  Four tuberculous patients, coming from the Hedjaz, were conveyed to the  hospital without any stay at the camp; two died after 20 and 30 days of  treatment respectively. In the infirmary at Sidi Bishr are now:    1 officer with a foot wound, 1 suffering from pharyngitis, and one  passing 1/2 per cent. of albumen.    Some of the Turkish officers were wounded in the war:    One whose thigh was amputated is provided with a fine artificial  substitute; one who had both bones of the lower arm fractured, and was  operated upon four times, is now well on the way to recovery.    One suffering from hemiplegia, owing to a fractured skull, is now able  to move again and to walk with crutches. Another lame officer is  affected by rupture of a main nerve in the leg.    Salik Sidki, judge of Mecca, entrusted us with a letter of thanks to the  English authorities, in recognition of the care which he received at the  hospital where he underwent a severe operation for a chronic affection  of the pylorus.      _Prisoners' Wishes._--Some officers complained of not being allowed to  go to Alexandria to make their purchases; but in the circumstances such  a request could not be gratified. On the other hand, a certain number of  officers have obtained permission to go to Cairo and spend a few days  with their wives interned in the Citadel; it is evident that this favour  is only accorded in exceptional cases and cannot be made general. To  extend it equally to sons, brothers and other relations, as some of the  prisoners desire, is clearly impossible.    The officers were offered two hours' walk every morning outside the  camp, in parties of 26, under the supervision of an unarmed soldier, on  condition of their giving their parole not to escape. This they refused,  declaring that a conditional proposal was no privilege. They can,  however, stroll about freely inside the limits of the camp, which is  very extensive.    We received several complaints concerning rain having recently found its  way into the barracks. But the extreme rarity of such an occurrence  makes it of no importance.      _Pay._--Officers' pay is fixed by the War Office. That of lieutenants  comes to 5 francs daily, that of captains to 5 francs 75, that of  superior officers is proportionate to their rank.    The orderlies, being privates, are not paid. Some of them receive pay  from their officers, others get nothing. Most of them have some money,  but nevertheless we have decided to remit L20 to the camp commandant for  the poorest soldiers' small needs.      _Correspondence._--Prisoners may write as often as they like, but seldom  take advantage of the privilege, and as a rule receive few letters,  which take from 40 to 45 days in reaching them. Few money orders come to  the camp.      _Religion and Amusements._--The prisoners have every chance of  worshipping according to their own creed. The imaums can use a building  arranged as a mosque and lighted by electricity. There is one mosque  inside the camp enclosure.    The camp contains 40 musical instruments; a piano has been hired for  the officers.    The prisoners play football, tennis, cards and chess. Many amuse  themselves with reading.          ~8. Bilbeis Camp.~    _(Visited on January 16, 1917.)_      Bilbeis Camp is situated 65 kilometres (40-1/2 miles) to the north-east  of Cairo, on the confines of the cultivated land of the Delta. Founded  in the month of August, 1916, it now contains 540 prisoners grouped as  follows:      _First Division._--One hundred and thirty-five Bedouins from the East  and the Sinai peninsula, and civilians coming from El Arish; 9 Arab  soldiers of the Ottoman army; 5 Turkish soldiers from Syria; 30  Egyptians.      _Second Division._--One hundred and seventy-five Senoussi and soldiers  from Tripoli; 185 Bedouins from the West, and civilian prisoners of  divers nationalities.    Among these prisoners are included several young boys who have relatives  among the interned. The characteristic of this camp is the diversity of  nationalities herein represented. Though the number of Turks is  restricted, we thought it wise to visit this camp in order to assure  ourselves that the treatment of the prisoners is the same as in other  Egyptian camps.    The camp commandant is Colonel Collins.    The camp is surrounded by a barbed wire fence.    The prisoners are lodged under canvas, 8 men to a tent. At the present  time two great barracks of timber framework and reeds are being erected,  each large enough to contain 250 men. Their dimensions ensure perfect  ventilation. The sandy soil shows no trace of damp. Between the tents  little gardens are laid out wherein, thanks to the abundant water, the  prisoners can grow flowers and vegetables.    The camp is lighted by paraffin reflector lamps.      _Bedding._--Mats of plaited rush. Two blankets per man.      _Exercise._--The dimensions of the camp leave large clear spaces where  the prisoners can walk at their pleasure.      _Food._--Cooking is done by the prisoners themselves, provisions being  supplied by the administration. The quantities are the same as in the  other camps. The menu consists of: meat, bread, butter, cheese, lentils,  fresh vegetables, onions, rice, etc. The prisoners whom we interrogated,  either personally or through the medium of an interpreter, declared that  they were well fed. A little canteen, set up in a tent apart, provides  them with such small luxuries as tea, sugar, and so on, at a moderate  price. The prisoners get tobacco regularly. Each man has a plate, an  enamelled bowl, and a spoon.      _Dress._--The prisoners have all received a complete outfit. Their  clothing was clean and warm. The mending of linen and outer garments is  done by tailor prisoners, working in a tent provided for the purpose.  Their headdress is the fez or a red cap.      _Hygiene._--Drinking water is distributed everywhere throughout the camp  by means of pipes well supplied with taps. Water for washing purposes is  abundantly distributed to the lavatories, douches and bathing-places.    The prisoners do their washing in well-fitted wash-houses; a movable  furnace facilitates the weekly disinfection of all the prisoners'  effects.    The latrines, on the Turkish system, consist of movable tubs, emptied  each day by means of a \"shadouf,\" and then disinfected with cresol and  whitewash. There are no smells in the camp.      _Medical Attention._--Dr. Ibrahim Zabaji, a Syrian refugee doctor,  undertakes the medical charge. His work is supervised twice a week by  Lieut.-Colonel Garner and Captain Scrimgeour.    There are 3 Turkish orderlies and 1 Coptic orderly.    The infirmary is clean and well appointed. It is sub-divided into 4  quarters: the consulting room, dispensary, sick ward and isolation ward.    The beds are iron with wire springs, the mattresses stuffed with  vegetable fibre, the number of blankets not limited.    All the men have been vaccinated against smallpox and cholera. We  learned from the infirmary registers that 30-40 men attend daily at 8  o'clock, the doctor's visiting hour.    The advanced age of many of the prisoners, who are suffering from  chronic affections, accounts for this large attendance.    The day we visited the infirmary it contained 8 patients: 3 cases of  malaria, 3 cases of bronchial pneumonia, and 2 cases of dysentery.    As soon as they arrived in camp 25 men were attacked with tertian  malaria; 15 are cured, 10 are still being treated with quinine. Of 7  attacked with dysentery 5 are now cured.    Ten men were suffering from trachoma and are still being treated with  protargol.    There has been no typhoid fever, nor typhus, nor any other epidemic in  the camp.    The serious cases are sent to the Egyptian hospital at Zagazig, where  they are looked after by native doctors. There are 4 prisoners now in  hospital: 1 eye case, 1 of tuberculosis, 1 of bronchitis, and 2 feverish  patients under observation.    Six prisoners have died in the hospital since the camp was established  here. One had tumour on the brain, 2 chronic enteritis, 1 tuberculosis,  and 1 an intestinal obstruction. The dead were buried with military  honours and according to the rites "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10598"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume I. (#8)"],[1,"ho' Sir Thomas was thus involved in public affairs and domestic  concerns, yet he found leisure to write many books, either against  Heretics, or of a devotional cast; for at that time, what he reckoned  Heresy began to diffuse itself over all Germany and Flanders. He built  a chapel in his parish church at Chelsea, which he constantly attended  in the morning; so steady was he in his devotion. He hired a house  also for many aged people in the parish, which he turned into an  hospital, and supported at his own expence. He at last rose to the  dignity of Lord High Chancellor upon the fall of Wolsey, and while he  sat as the Chief Judge of the nation in one court, his father,  aged upwards of 90, sat as Chief Justice in the King's Bench; a  circumstance which never before, nor ever since happened, of a father  being a Judge, and his son a Chancellor at the same time. Every day,  as the Chancellor went to the Bench, he kneeled before his father, and  asked his blessing. The people soon found the difference between the  intolerable pride of Wolsey, and the gentleness and humility of More;  he permitted every one to approach him without reserve; he dispatched  business with great assiduity, and so cleared the court of tedious  suits, that he more than once came to the Bench, and calling for a  cause, there was none to try. As no dignity could inspire him with  pride, so no application to the most important affairs could divert  him from sallies of humour, and a pleasantry of behaviour. It once  happened, that a beggar's little dog which she had lost, was presented  to lady More, of which me was very fond; but at last the beggar  getting notice where the dog was, she came to complain to Sir Thomas  as he was sitting in his hall, that his lady withheld her dog from  her; presently my lady was sent for, and the dog brought with her,  which he taking in his hand, caused his wife to stand at the upper end  of the hall, and the beggar at the other; he then bad each of them  call the dog, which when they did, the dog went presently to the  beggar, forsaking my lady. When he saw this, he bad my lady be  contented for it was none of hers. My Lord Chancellor then gave the  woman a piece of gold, which would have bought ten such dogs, and bid  her be careful of it for the future.    A friend of his had spent much time in composing a book, and went to  Sir Thomas to have his opinion of it; he desired him to turn it  into rhime; which at the expence of many years labour he at last  accomplished, and came again to have his opinion: Yea marry, says he,  now it is somewhat; now it is rhime, but before it was neither rhime  nor reason.    But fortune, which had been long propitious to our author, began now  to change sides, and try him as well with affliction as prosperity,  in both which characters, his behaviour, integrity and courage were  irreproachable. The amorous monarch King Henry VIII, at last obtained  from his Parliament and Council a divorce from his lawful wife, and  being passionately fond of Anna Bullen, he married her, and declared  her Queen of England: This marriage Sir Thomas had always opposed, and  held it unlawful for his Sovereign to have another wife during his  first wife's life. The Queen who was of a petulant disposition, and  elated with her new dignity could not withhold her resentment against  him, but animated all her relations, and the parties inclined to the  protestant interest, to persecute him with rigour. Not long after the  divorce, the Council gave authority for the publication of a book,  in which the reasons why this divorce was granted were laid down; an  answer was soon published, with which Sir Thomas More was charged as  the author, of which report however he sufficiently cleared himself in  a letter to Mr. Cromwel, then secretary, and a great favourite with  King Henry. In the parliament held in the year 1534, there was an  oath, framed, called the Oath of Supremacy, in which all English  subjects should renounce the pope's authority, and swear also to the  succession of Queen Ann's children, and lady Mary illegitimate. This  oath was given to all the clergy as well bishops as priests, but no  lay-man except Sir Thomas More was desired to take it; he was summoned  to appear at Lambeth before archbishop Cranmer, the Lord Chancellor  Audley, Mr. Secretary Cromwel, and the abbot of Westminster, appointed  commissioners by the King to tender this oath. More absolutely  refused to take it, from a principle of conscience: and after various  expostulations he was ordered into the custody of the abbot of  Westminster; and soon after he was sent to the tower, and the  lieutenant had strict charge to prevent his writing, or holding  conversation with any persons but those sent by the secretary. The  Lord Chancellor, duke of Norfolk, and Mr. Cromwel paid him frequent  visits, and pressed: him to take the oath, which he still refused.  About a year after his commitment to the tower, by the importunity of  Queen Ann, he was arraign'd at the King's Bench Bar, for obstinately  refusing, the oath of supremacy, and wilfully and obstinately opposing  the King's second marriage. He went to the court leaning on his staff,  because he had been much weakened by his imprisonment; his judges  were, Audley, Lord Chancellor; Fitz James, Chief Justice; Sir John  Baldwin, Sir Richard Leister, Sir John Port, Sir John Spelman, Sir  Walter Luke, Sir Anthony Fitzherbert: The King's attorney opened  against him with a very opprobrious libel; the chief evidence were  Mr. secretary Cromwell, to whom he had uttered some disrespectful  expressions of the King's authority, the duke of Suffolk and earl  of Wiltshire: He replied to the accusation with great composure and  strength of argument; and when one Mr. Rich swore against him, he  boldly asserted that Rich was perjured, and wished he might never see  God's Countenance in mercy, if what he asserted was not true; besides  that, Rich added to perjury, the baseness of betraying private  conversation. But notwithstanding his defence, the jury, who were  composed of creatures of the court, brought in their verdict, guilty;  and he had sentence of death pronounced against him, which he  heard without emotion. He then made a long speech addressed to the  Chancellor, and observed to Mr. Rich, that he was more sorry for his  perjury, than for the sentence that had just been pronounced against  him: Rich had been sent by the secretary to take away all Sir Thomas's  books and papers, during which time some conversation passed, which  Rich misrepresented in order to advance himself in the King's favour.  He was ordered again to the Tower till the King's pleasure should be  known. When he landed at Tower Wharf, his favourite daughter Margaret,  who had not seen him since his confinement, came there to take her  last adieu, and forgetting the bashfulness and delicacy of her sex,  press'd thro' the multitude, threw her arms about her father's neck  and often embraced him; they had but little conversation, and their  parting was so moving, that all the spectators dissolved in tears, and  applauded the affection and tenderness of the lady which could enable  her to take her farewel under so many disadvantages.    Some time after his condemnation Mr. secretary Cromwel waited on Sir  Thomas, and entreated him to accept his Majesty's pardon, upon the  condition of taking the oath, and expressed great tenderness towards  him. This visit and seeming friendship of Cromwel not a little  affected him, he revolved in his mind the proposal which he made,  and as his fate was approaching, perhaps his resolution staggered  a little, but calling to mind his former vows, his conscience, his  honour, he recovered himself again, and stood firmly prepared for his  fall. Upon this occasion it was that he wrote the following verses,  mentioned both by Mr. Roper and Mr. Hoddeson, which I shall here  insert as a specimen of his poetry.      Ey flattering fortune, loke thou never so fayre,    Or never so pleasantly begin to smile,    As tho' thou would'st my ruine all repayre,    During my life thou shalt not me begile,    Trust shall I God to entre in a while    His haven of heaven sure and uniforme,    Ever after thy calme loke I for a storme.    On the 6th of July, 1534, in the 54th year of his age, the sentence of  condemnation was executed upon him on Tower Hill, by severing his head  from his body. As he was carried to the scaffold, some low people  hired by his enemies cruelly insulted him, to whom he gave cool and  effectual answers. Being now under the scaffold, he looked at it with  great calmness, and observing it too slenderly built, he said merrily  to Mr. Lieutenant, \"I pray you, Sir, see me safe up, and for my  coming down let me shift for myself.\" When he mounted on the  scaffold, he threw his eyes round the multitude, desired them to pray  for him, and to bear him witness that he died for the holy catholic  church, a faithful servant both to God and the King. His gaiety and  propension to jesting did not forsake him in his last moments; when he  laid his head upon the block, he bad the executioner stay till he  had removed aside his beard, saying, \"that that had never committed  treason.\" When the executioner asked his forgiveness, he kissed him  and said, \"thou wilt do me this day a greater benefit than any mortal  man can be able to give me; pluck up thy spirit man, and be not afraid  to do thy office, my neck is very short, take heed therefore that thou  strike not awry for saving thy honesty.\"    Thus by an honest but mistaken zeal fell Sir Thomas More; a man of wit  and parts superior to all his contemporaries of integrity unshaken;  of a generous and noble disposition; of a courage intrepid; a  great scholar and a devout christian. Wood says that he was but an  indifferent divine, and that he was very ignorant of antiquity and the  learning of the fathers, but he allows him to be a"]]]
