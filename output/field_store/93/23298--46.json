Then the two inquisitors went to the house of the pious    man, before whom the paralytic had been unable to rise. His widow gave    him an excellent character; he was gentle and pious; prayed three times a    day, and at midnight rose and went to a special chamber to say his    prayers. No one had ever seen the room but himself, as he ever kept the    key in his bosom. The two inquisitors opened the door of this chamber,    and found a small box hidden in the window-sill; they opened the box, and    found in it a golden figure bearing a crucifix. Thus the man had been one    of those who do the deeds of Zimri, and expect the reward of Phineas.      TABLE TALK    Joseph and Enan then retire to rest, and their sleep is sweet and long. By  strange and devious ways they continue their journey on the morrow,  starting at dawn. Again they pass the night at the house of one of Enan's  friends, Rabbi Judah, a ripe old sage and hospitable, who welcomes them  cordially, feeds them bountifully, gives them spiced dishes, wine of the  grape and the pomegranate, and then tells stories and proverbs \"from the  books of the Arabs.\"      A man said to a sage, \"Thou braggest of thy wisdom, but it came from me.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the sage, \"and it forgot its way back.\"--Who is the worst    of men? He who is good in his own esteem.--Said a king to a sage, \"Sweet    would be a king's reign if it lasted forever.\" \"Had such been your    predecessor's lot,\" replied the wise man, \"how would you have reached the    throne?\"--A man laid a complaint before the king; the latter drove the    suppliant out with violence. \"I entered with one complaint,\" sighed the    man, \"I leave with two.\"--What is style? Be brief and do not repeat    yourself.--The king once visited a nobleman's house, and asked the    latter's son, \"Whose house is better, your father's or mine?\" \"My    father's,\" said the boy, \"while the king is in it.\"--A king put on a new    robe, which did not become him. \"It is not good to wear,\" said a    courtier, \"but it is good to put on.\" The king put the robe on him.--A    bore visited a sick man. \"What ails thee?\" he asked. \"Thy presence,\" said    the sufferer.--A man of high lineage abused a wise man of lowly birth.    \"My lineage is a blot on me,\" retorted a sage, \"thou art a blot on thy    lineage.\"--To another who reviled him for his lack of noble ancestry, he    retorted, \"Thy noble line ends with thee, with me mine begins.\"--Diogenes    and Dives were attacked by robbers. \"Woe is me,\" said Dives, \"if they    recognize me.\" \"Woe is me,\" said Diogenes, \"if they do not recognize    me.\"--A philosopher sat by the target at which the archers were shooting.    \"'Tis the safest spot,\" said he.--An Arab's brother died. \"Why did he    die?\" one asked. \"Because he lived,\" was the answer.--\"What hast thou    laid up for the cold weather?\" they asked a poor fellow. \"Shivering,\" he    answered.--Death is the dread of the rich and the hope of the    poor.--Which is the best of the beasts?

But fear not. Thou art no    doctor.\"--Three things weary: a lamp that will not burn, a messenger that    dawdles, a table spread and waiting.    Then follows a string of sayings about _threes_:      Reason rules the body, wisdom is the pilot, law is its light. Might is    the lion's, burdens are the ox's, wisdom is man's; spinning the spider's,    building the bee's, making stores the ant's. In three cases lying is    permissible: in war, in reconciling man to man, in appeasing one's wife.    Their host concludes his lengthy list of sententious remarks thus:      A king had a signet ring, on which were engraved the words, \"Thou hast    bored me: rise!\" and when a guest stayed too long, he showed the visitor    the ring.-The heir of a wealthy man squandered his money, and a sage saw    him eating bread and salted olives. \"Hadst thou thought that this would    be thy food, this would not be thy food.\"-Marry no widow. She will lament    her first husband's death.      THE CITY OF ENAN    This was the signal for the party to retire to rest.    Next day the wayfarers reach Enan's own city, the place he had all along  desired Joseph to see. He shows Joseph his house; but the latter replies,  \"I crave food, not sight-seeing.\" \"Surely,\" says Enan, \"the more hurry the  less speed.\" At last the table is spread; the cloth is ragged, the dishes  contain unleavened bread, such as there is no pleasure in eating, and there  is a dish of herbs and vinegar. Then ensues a long wrangle, displaying much  medical knowledge, on the physiology of herbs and vegetables, on the eating  of flesh, much and fast. Enan makes sarcastic remarks on Joseph's rapacious  appetite. He tells Joseph, he must not eat this or that. A joint of lamb is  brought on the table, Enan says the head is bad, and the feet, and the  flesh, and the fat; so that Joseph has no alternative but to eat it all. \"I  fear that what happened to the king, will befall thee,\" said Enan. \"Let me  feed first,\" said Joseph; \"then you can tell me what happened to the king.\"      THE PRINCESS AND THE ROSE      A gardener came to his garden in the winter. It was the month of Tebet,    and he found some roses in flower. He rejoiced at seeing them; and he    plucked them, and put them on a precious dish, carried them to the king,    and placed them before him. The king was surprised, and the flowers were    goodly in his sight; and he gave the gardener one hundred pieces of gold.    Then said the king in his heart, \"To-day we will make merry, and have a    feast.\" All his servants and faithful ministers were invited to rejoice    over the joy of the roses. And he sent for his only daughter, then with    child; and she stretched forth her hand to take a rose, and a serpent    that lay in the dish leapt at her and startled her, and she died before    night.      QUESTION AND ANSWER    But Joseph's appetite was not to be stayed by such tales as this. So Enan  tells him of the \"Lean Fox and the Hole\"; but in vain. \"Open not thy mouth  to Satan,\" says Joseph. \"I fear for my appetite, that it become smaller\";  and goes on eating.    Now Enan tries another tack: he will question him, and put him through his  paces. But Joseph yawns and protests that he has eaten too much to keep his  eyes open.      \"How canst thou sleep,\" said Enan, \"when thou hast eaten everything,    fresh and stale? As I live, thou shalt not seek thy bed until I test thy    wisdom-until I prove whether all this provender has entered the stomach    of a wise man or a fool.\"    Then follows an extraordinary string of anatomical, medical, scientific,  and Talmudic questions about the optic nerves; the teeth; why a man lowers  his head when thinking over things he has never known, but raises his head  when thinking over what he once knew but has forgotten; the physiology of  the digestive organs, the physiology of laughter; why a boy eats more than  a man; why it is harder to ascend a hill than to go down; why snow is  white; why babies have no teeth; why children's first set of teeth fall  out; why saddest tears are saltest; why sea water is heavier than fresh;  why hail descends in summer; why the sages said that bastards are mostly  clever. To these questions, which Enan pours out in a stream, Joseph  readily gives answers. But now Enan is hoist with his own petard.      \"I looked at him,\" continues the poet, \"and sleep entrapped his eyes, and    his eyelids kissed the irides. Ah! I laughed in my heart. Now I will talk    to him, and puzzle him as he has been puzzling me. He shall not sleep, as    he would not let me sleep. 'My lord,' said I, 'let me now question thee.'    'I am sleepy,' said he, 'but ask on.' 'What subject shall I choose?' I    said. 'Any subject,' he replied; 'of all knowledge I know the half.'\"    Joseph asks him astronomical, musical, logical, arithmetical questions;    to all of which Enan replies, \"I do not know.\" \"But,\" protests Joseph,    \"how couldst thou assert that thou knewest half of every subject, when it    is clear thou knowest nothing?\" \"Exactly,\" says"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#7)"],[1,"compelled the Roman army, both generals and soldiers, each    clad in a single garment, to pass \"under the yoke\" made of two spears    set upright with one laid across, while they stood by and jeered. If any    Roman looked angry or sullen at his disgrace, they struck or even killed    him. This was called the disaster of the Caudine Forks, from the pass    where the Romans were caught.    THE ROMANS AND THE GREEK CITIES. Not many years after this the    Romans quarreled with the Greek cities of southern Italy. The Greeks of    Tarentum, situated where Taranto is now, called to their aid Pyrrhus,    who ruled a part of Alexander's old kingdom. Pyrrhus was a skilful    general, and he had with him, besides his foot-soldiers and horsemen,    many trained elephants. A charge of these elephants was too much for the    Romans, who were already hard pressed by the long spears of the soldiers    of Pyrrhus. But the Romans were ready for another battle, and in this    they fought so stubbornly and killed so many of the Greek soldiers that    Pyrrhus cried out, \"Another victory like this and we are ruined.\" In a    third battle, which took place 275 B.C., he was defeated, and returned    to Greece, leaving the Romans masters of the Greek cities in Italy.    THE ROMANS CONQUERORS OF ITALY. By this time there were few tribes    south of the river Po which did not own the Romans as their masters. All    Italy was united under their rule. This was the first step in the    conquest of the world that lay about the Mediterranean Sea and in the    extension of that ancient world to the shores of the Atlantic and to    England. Before we read the story of the other conquests we must inquire    who the Roman people were and how they lived.    HOW THE ROMANS LIVED. In early times most of the Romans were    farmers or cattle raisers. A man's wealth was reckoned according to the    number of cattle he owned. Their manner of living was simple and frugal.    Like the Greek, the Roman had his games. He enjoyed chariot-races, but    used slaves or freedmen as drivers. He also went to the theater,    although he thought it unworthy of a Roman to be an actor. Such an    occupation was for foreigners or slaves.      [Illustration: A ROMAN WEARING A TOGA]    ROMAN BOYS AT SCHOOL. The boys at school did not learn poems, as    did the Greek boys, but studied the first set of laws made by the    Romans, called the Twelve Tables. This they read, copied, and learned by    heart. Their interest in laws was the first sign that they were to    become the world's greatest lawmakers.    ROMAN WOMEN. In their respect for women the Romans were superior to    the Greeks. The Roman mother did not remain in the women's apartments of    the house, as she was expected to do at Athens, but was her husband's    companion, received his guests, directed her household, and went in and    out as she chose.    PATRICIANS AND PLEBEIANS. The men of the families which first ruled    Rome were called patricians or nobles, while the rest were plebeians or    common people. There were also many slaves, but they had no rights. At    first only the patricians knew exactly what the laws were, because the    laws were not written in a book. When disputes arose between patricians    and plebeians about property, the plebeians believed the patricians    changed the laws in order to gain an advantage over their poorer    neighbors.      The story is told that twice the plebeians withdrew from the city and    refused to return until their wrongs were removed. Then they compelled    the nobles to draw up the laws in a roll called the Twelve Tables. At    this time messengers were sent to Athens to examine the laws of the    Greeks. The richer plebeians were also gradually admitted to all the    offices of the Roman republic, and so became nobles themselves.    GOVERNMENT AT ROME. The Romans had once been ruled by kings, but    now their chief officers were consuls. Two consuls were chosen each year    because the Romans feared that a single consul might make himself a    king, or, at least, gain too much power. The real rulers of Rome,    however, were the senators, the men who had held the prominent offices.    There were assemblies of the people, but these generally did what the    senators or other officers told them to do.      Among the interesting officers of Rome was the censor, who drew up a    list or census of the citizens and of their property. Another officer    was the tribune, chosen in the beginning by the plebeians to protect    them against the patricians. The tribune was not at first a member of    the senate, but he was given a seat outside the door, and if a law was    proposed that would injure the plebeians, he cried out, \"Veto,\" which    means \"I forbid,\" and the law had to be dropped. This is the origin of    our word \"veto.\"    HOW THE ROMANS TREATED THE ITALIANS. The Romans were wise in their    dealings with the cities or tribes which they conquered. They not only    sent out colonies of their fellow-citizens to occupy a part of the lands    they had seized, but they also gave the conquered peoples a share in    their government, and in some cases allowed them to act as citizens of    Rome. These new Roman citizens helped the older Romans in their wars    with other tribes. In this way Roman towns gradually spread over Italy.

The conquest of Italy by the Romans took about two    hundred and fifty years. The conquest of the peoples living in the    other lands on the shores of the Mediterranean took nearly as long    again. Only twice in these four or five hundred years was Rome in    serious danger of destruction. Once it was by the Gauls, as we have    read, who captured all the city except the citadel. The second time it    was by the Carthaginians, who lived on the northern coast of Africa.    The Romans were finally victorious over all their enemies because they    were patient and courageous in misfortune and refused to believe that    they could be conquered.    CAUSE OF WAR WITH CARTHAGE. The Carthaginians were angry at the way    the Romans treated them. They watched with alarm the steady growth of    the Roman power, and feared that the Romans, if masters of Italy,    would attack their trade with the cities of the western Mediterranean.    A quarrel broke out over a city in Sicily. At first the Carthaginians    seemed to have the best of it, because they had a strong war fleet    while the Romans had only a few small vessels. But the Romans    hurriedly built ships and placed upon each a kind of drawbridge,    fitted with great hooks called grappling-irons. These they let down    upon the enemy's decks as soon as the ships came close enough, and    over these drawbridges the Roman soldiers rushed and captured the    Carthaginian ships.      When the Carthaginians asked for peace, the Romans demanded a great    sum of money and a promise that the Carthaginians would leave the    cities in Sicily which they occupied. Soon afterward the Romans took    advantage of a mutiny in the Carthaginian army to demand more money    and to seize Sardinia and Corsica. No wonder the Carthaginians were    angry. The result was a new and more terrible war.    HANNIBAL. The Carthaginians in the new war were led by Hannibal, who    understood how to fight battles better than any of the generals whom    the Romans sent against him. The story is told that when he was a boy    his father made him promise, at the altar of his city's gods, undying    hatred to Rome. Even the Romans thought him a wonderful man. Their    historians said that toil did not wear out his body or exhaust his    energy. Cold or heat were alike to him. He never ate or drank more    than he needed. He slept when he had time, whether it was day or    night, wrapping himself in a military cloak and lying on the ground in    the midst of his soldiers. He did not dress better than the other    officers, but his weapons and his horses were the best in the army.    WAR CARRIED INTO ITALY, 218 B.C. Hannibal decided that the war should    be carried into Italy to the very gates of Rome. He started from    Spain, half of which the Carthaginians ruled, marched across southern    Gaul, and came to the foot-hills of the Alps. To climb the Alps was"]]]
