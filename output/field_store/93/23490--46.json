Besides, there was another difficulty. Mr. Asquith himself, though  serenely persuaded that he is a Liberal statesman, is, in effect, very  much what the Kaiser would have been if he had been a Yorkshireman and a  lawyer, instead of being only half English and the other half  Hohenzollern, and an anointed emperor to boot. As far as popular  liberties are concerned, history will make no distinction between Mr.  Asquith and Metternich. He is forced to keep on the safe academic ground  of Belgium by the very obvious consideration that if he began to talk of  the Kaiser's imprisonments of editors and democratic agitators and so  forth, a Homeric laughter, punctuated with cries of, \"How about  Denshawai?\" \"What price Tom Mann?\" \"Votes for women!\" \"Been in India  lately?\" \"Make McKenna Kaiser,\" \"Or dear old Herbert Gladstone,\" etc.,  etc., would promptly spoil that pose. The plain fact is that, Militarism  apart, Germany is in many ways more democratic in practice than England;  indeed the Kaiser has been openly reviled as a coward by his Junkers  because he falls short of Mr. Asquith in calm indifference to Liberal  principles and blank ignorance of working-class sympathies, opinions,  and interests.    Mr. Asquith had also to distract public attention from the fact that  three official members of his Government, all men of unquestioned and  conspicuous patriotism and intellectual honesty, walked straight out  into private life on the declaration of war. One of them, Mr. John  Burns, did so at an enormous personal sacrifice, and has since  maintained a grim silence far more eloquent than the famous speech  Germany invented for him. It is not generally believed that these three  statesmen were actuated by a passion for the violation of Belgian  neutrality.    On the whole, it was impossible for the Government to seize its grand  chance and put itself at the head of the popular movement that responded  to Sir Edward Grey's declaration: the very simple reason being that the  Government does not represent the nation, and is in its sympathies just  as much a Junker government as the Kaiser's. And so, what the Government  cannot do has to be done by unofficial persons with clean and brilliant  anti-Junker records like Mr. Wells, Mr. Arnold Bennett, Mr. Neil Lyons,  and Mr. Jerome K. Jerome. Neither Mr. Asquith nor Sir Edward Grey can  grasp, as these real spokesmen of their time do, the fact that we just  simply want to put an end to Potsdamnation, both at home and abroad.  Both of them probably think Potsdam a very fine and enviable  institution, and want England to out-Potsdam Potsdam and to monopolize  the command of the seas; a monstrous aspiration. We, I take it, want to  guarantee that command of the sea which is the common heritage of  mankind to the tiniest State and the humblest fisherman that depends on  the sea for a livelihood. We want the North Sea to be as safe for  everybody, English or German, as Portland Place.      *The Need for Recrimination.*    And now somebody who would rather I had not said all this (having  probably talked dreadful nonsense about Belgium and so forth for a month  past) is sure to ask: \"Why all this recrimination? What is done is done.  Is it not now the duty of every Englishman to sink all differences in  the face of the common peril?\" etc., etc. To all such prayers to be  shielded from that terrible thing, the truth, I must reply that history  consists mainly of recrimination, and that I am writing history because  an accurate knowledge of what has occurred is not only indispensable to  any sort of reasonable behaviour on our part in the face of Europe when  the inevitable day of settlement comes, but because it has a practical  bearing on the most perilously urgent and immediate business before us:  the business of the appeal to the nation for recruits and for enormous  sums of money. It has to decide the question whether that appeal shall  be addressed frankly to our love of freedom, and our tradition (none the  less noble and moving because it is so hard to reconcile with the  diplomatic facts) that England is a guardian of the world's liberty, and  not to bad law about an obsolete treaty, and cant about the diabolical  personal disposition of the Kaiser, and the wounded propriety of a  peace-loving England, and all the rest of the slosh and tosh that has  been making John Bull sick for months past. No doubt at first, when we  were all clasping one another's hands very hard and begging one another  not to be afraid, almost anything was excusable. Even the war notes of  Mr. Garvin, which stood out as the notes of a gentleman amid a welter of  scurrilous rubbish and a rather blackguardly _Punch_ cartoon mocking the  agony of Berlin (_Punch_ having turned its non-interventionist coat very  promptly), had sometimes to run: \"We know absolutely nothing of what is  happening at the front, except that the heroism of the British troops  will thrill the ages to the last syllable of recorded time,\" or words to  that effect. But now it is time to pull ourselves together; to feel our  muscle; to realize the value of our strength and pluck; and to tell the  truth unashamed like men of courage and character, not to shirk it like  the official apologists of a Foreign Office plot.      *What Germany Should Have Done.*    And first, as I despise critics who put people in the wrong without  being able to set them right, I shall, before I go any further with my  criticism of our official position, do the Government and the Foreign  Office the service of finding a correct official position for them; for  I admit that the popular position, though sound as far as it goes, is  too crude for official use. This correct official position can be found  only by considering what Germany should have done, and might have done  had she not been, like our own Junkers, so fascinated by the Militarist  craze, and obsessed by the chronic Militarist panic, that she was \"in  too great hurry to bid the devil good morning.\" The matter is simple  enough: she should have entrusted the security of her western frontier  to the public opinion of the west of Europe and to America, and fought  Russia, if attacked, with her rear not otherwise defended. The  Militarist theory is that we, France and England, would have immediately  sprung at her from behind; but that is just how the Militarist theory  gets its votaries into trouble by assuming that Europe is a chess board.  Europe is not a chess board; but a populous continent in which only a  very few people are engaged in military chess; and even those few have  many other things to consider besides capturing their adversary's king.  Not only would it have been impossible for England to have attacked  Germany under such circumstances; but if France had done so England  could not have assisted her, and might even have been compelled by  public opinion to intervene by way of a joint protest from England and  America, or even by arms, on her behalf if she were murderously pressed  on both flanks. Even our Militarists and diplomatists would have had  reasons for such an intervention. An aggressive Franco-Russian hegemony,  if it crushed Germany, would be quite as disagreeable to us as a German  one. Thus Germany would at worst have been fighting Russia and France  with the sympathy of all the other Powers, and a chance of active  assistance from some of them, especially those who share her hostility  to the Russian Government. Had France not attacked her--and though I am  as ignorant of the terms of the Franco-Russian alliance as Sir Edward  Grey is strangely content to be, I cannot see how the French Government  could have justified to its own people a fearfully dangerous attack on  Germany had Russia been the aggressor--Germany would have secured fair  play for her fight with Russia. But even the fight with Russia was not  inevitable. The ultimatum to Servia was the escapade of a dotard: a  worse crime than the assassination that provoked it. There is no reason  to doubt the conclusion in Sir Maurice de Bunsen's despatch (No. 161)  that it could have been got over, and that Russia and Austria would have  thought better of fighting and come to terms. Peace was really on the  cards; and the sane game was to play for it.      *The Achilles Heel of Militarism.*    Instead, Germany flew at France's throat, and by incidentally invading  Belgium gave us the excuse our Militarists wanted to attack her with the  full sympathy of the nation. Why did she do this stupid thing? Not  because of the counsels of General von Bernhardi. On the contrary, he  had warned her expressly against allowing herself to be caught between  Russia and a Franco-British combination until she had formed a  counterbalancing alliance with America, Italy, and Turkey. And he had  most certainly not encouraged her to depend on England sparing her: on  the contrary, he could not sufficiently admire the wily ruthlessness  with which England watches her opportunity and springs at her foe when  the foe is down. (He little knew, poor man, how much he was flattering  our capacity for Realpolitik!) But he had reckoned without his creed's  fatal and fundamental weakness, which is, that as Junker-Militarism  promotes only stupid people and snobs, and suppresses genuine realists  as if they were snakes, it always turns out when a crisis arrives that  \"the silly people don't know their own silly business.\" The Kaiser and  his ministers made an appalling mess of their job. They were inflamed by  Bernhardi; but they did not understand him. They swallowed his flattery,  but did not take in his strategy or his warnings. They knew that when  the moment came to face the Franco-Russian alliance, they were to make a  magnificient dash at France and sweep her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#8)"],[1,"modesty.  \"I  don't know what I may be able to do--if anything. I would not feel  right in taking Mr. Bartholomew's twenty-five thousand dollars for  nothing.\"    \"Quite right, my boy,\" said Mr. Swift, approvingly.    \"Never mind that,\" said the financial manager, rather grimly.  \"It was  his own offer and his risk. That twenty-five thousand comes to our  account.\"    Tom laughed. \"All business, Ned, aren't you? But there is more than  business for the Swift Construction Company in this. Our reputation for  fair dealing as well as for inventive powers is linked up with this  contract.    \"I want to show the Jandel people--to say nothing of the bigger  firms--that the Swifts are to be reckoned with when it comes to  electric invention. Other roads will be electrifying their lines as  fast as it is proved that the electric-driven locomotive has the bulge  on the steam-driven.    \"In the case of the Hendrickton & Pas Alos there are very steep grades  to overcome. Supposedly an electric motor-drive should achieve the same  speed on a hill as on the level. But there is the weight of the train  to be counted on.    \"The H. & P. A. has a two per cent. grade in more than one place. Mr.  Bartholomew confessed as much to me last night. The electric-driven  locomotive of the powerful freight type, which the Jandel people built  for Mr. Bartholomew, can make about sixteen miles an hour on those  grades, although they can hit it up to thirty miles an hour on level  track.    \"His passenger locomotives turn off a mile a minute and more, on the  level road; but they can not climb those steep grades at a much  livelier pace than the freight engines. That is why he is talking about  two-mile-a-minute locomotives. He must get a mighty speedy locomotive,  for both freight and passenger service, to keep ahead of Montagne  Lewis's rival road, the Hendrickton & Western.\"    \"You don't suppose it can be done, do you?\" demanded Ned. \"The  two-mile-a-minute locomotive, I mean, Tom.\"    \"That is the target I am to aim for,\" returned his friend, soberly. \"At  any rate, I hope to improve on the type of locomotive Mr. Bartholomew  is now using, so that the hundred thousand dollars bonus will come our  way as well as this first twenty-five thousand.\"    \"That wouldn't pay for one engine, would it?\" cried Ned.    \"Nor is it expected to. The bonus has nothing to do with payment for  any model, or patent, or anything of the kind. To tell you the truth,  Ned, I understand those big locomotives used by the Chicago, Milwaukee  & St. Paul cost them about one hundred and twelve thousand dollars  each.\"    \"Whew! Some price, I'll tell the world!\" murmured the youthful  financial manager of the Swift Construction Company.    When the conference was over, and Tom had been through the workshop to  overlook several little jobs that were in process of completion by his  trusted mechanics, it was lunch time. He left word that he would not be  back that day, for this new task he was to attack was not to be  approached with any haphazard thought.    Tom knew quite as well as his father knew that the idea of improving  the Jandel patent on electric locomotives was no small thing. The  Jandel people had claimed that their patent was the very last word in  electric motor-power. And Tom was quite willing to acknowledge that in  some ways this claim was true.    But in invention, especially in the field of electric invention, what  is the last word today may be ancient history tomorrow.    It was because this field is so broad and the possibility of  improvement in every branch of electrical science so exciting, that Tom  had accepted Mr. Bartholomew's challenge with such eagerness.    Tom went back to the house for lunch, and as he joined his father in  the dining room he remarked to Eradicate:    \"I want the electric runabout brought around after lunch. I am going to  Waterfield. Tell Koku, will you, Rad?\"    \"Tell that crazy fellow?\" demanded the old colored man heatedly. \"Why  should I tell him, Massa Tom? Ain't I able to bring dat runabout out o'  de garbarge? Shore I is!\"    \"You can't do everything, Rad,\" said Tom, soberly. \"That is humanly  impossible.\"    \"But dat Koku can't do nothin' right. Dat's inhumanly possible, Massa  Tom.\"    \"Give him a chance, Rad. I have to take Koku with me this afternoon.  You must give your attention to the house and to father.\"    \"Huh! Umm!\" grunted Eradicate.     Rad was jealous of anybody who waited on Tom besides himself.  Yet he was proud of responsibility, too. He teetered between the pride  of being in charge at home and accompanying his young master, and  finally replied:    \"Well, in course, you ain't going to be gone long, Massa Tom.  And yo'  father does like to get his nap undisturbed. And he'll want his pot o'  tea afterwards. So I'll let dat irresponsible Koku go wid yo'. But yo'  got to watch him, Massa Tom. Dat giant don't know what he's about half  de time.\"    As Koku was not within hearing to challenge that statement, things went  all right. When Tom came out of the house after eating, he found his  very fast car waiting for him, with the giant standing beside it at the  curb.    \"Get in at the back, Koku,\" said Tom. \"I am going to take you with me.\"    \"Master is much wise,\" said Koku. \"That man with big feet will not hurt  Master while Koku is with him.\"    To tell the truth Tom had quite forgotten the supposed spy that had  attacked him the night before. He needed Koku for a purpose other than  that of bodyguard. But he made no comment upon the giant's remark.    They stopped at one of the gates of the works, and Tom instructed Koku  to bring out and put into the car certain boxes and tools that he  wished to take with him. Then he drove on, taking the road to  Waterfield.    This way led through farmlands and patches of woods, a rough country in  part. A mile out of the limits of Shopton the road edged a deep valley,  the sidehill sparsely wooded.    Almost at once, and where there was not a dwelling in sight, they saw a  figure tramping in the road ahead, a big man, roughly dressed, and  wearing a broad-brimmed hat. Somehow, his appearance made Tom reduce  speed and he hesitated to pass the pedestrian.    The man did not hear the runabout at first; or, at least, he did not  look over his shoulder. He strode on heavily, but rapidly. Suddenly the  young inventor heard the giant behind him emit a hissing breath.    \"Master!\" whispered the giant.    \"What's up now?\" demanded Tom, but without glancing around.    \"The big feet!\" exclaimed Koku.    The giant's own feet were shod with difficulty in civilized footgear,  but compared with his other physical dimensions his feet did not seem  large. The man ahead wore coarse boots which actually looked too big  for him! Koku started up in the back of the car as the latter drew  nearer to the stranger.    The man looked back at last and Tom gained a clear view of his  features--roughly carved, dark as an Indian's, and holding a grim  expression in repose that of itself was far from breeding confidence.  In a moment, too, the expression changed into one of active emotion.  The man glared at the young inventor with unmistakable malevolence.    \"Master!\" hissed Koku again. \"The big feet!\" The fellow must have seen  Koku's face and understood the giant's expression. In a flash he turned  and leaped out of the roadway. The sidehill was steep and broken here,  but he went down the slope in great strides and with every appearance  of wishing to evade the two in the motor-car.    The giant's savage war cry followed the fugitive. Koku leaped from the  moving car. Tom yelled:    \"Stop it, Koku! You don't know that that is the man.\"    \"The big feet!\" repeated the giant. \"Master see the red mud dried on  Big Feet's boots? That mud from Master's garden.\"    Again Koku uttered his savage cry, and in strides twice the length of  those of the running man, started on the latter's trail.          Chapter VIII    An Enemy in the Dark      The situation offered suggestions of trouble that stung Tom to  immediate action. The impetuousness of his giant often resulted in  difficulties which the young inventor would have been glad to escape.    Now Koku was following just the wrong path. Tom Swift knew it.    \"Koku, you madman!\" he shouted after the huge native. \"Come back here!  Hear me? Back!\"    Koku hesitated. He shot a wondering look over his shoulder, but his  long legs continued to carry him down the slope after the dark-faced  stranger.    \"Come back, I say!\" shouted Tom again. \"Have I got to come after you?  Koku! If you don't mind what you're told I'll send you back to your own  country and you'll have to eat snakes and lizards, as you used to. Come  here!\"    Whether it was because of this threat of a change of diet, which Koku  now abhorred, or the fact that he had really become somewhat  disciplined and that he fairly worshiped Tom, the giant stopped. The  man with the big shoes disappeared behind a hedge of low trees.    \"Get back up here!\" ejaculated Tom sternly. \"I'll never take you away  from the house with me again if you don't obey me.\"    \"Master!\" ejaculated the giant, slowly approaching. \"That Big Feet--\"    \"I don't care if he made those footprints in the yard last night or  not. I don't want him touched. I didn't even want him to know that we  guessed he had been sneaking about the house.  Understand?\"    \"Of a courseness,\" grumbled Koku. \"Koku understand everything Master  say.\"    \"Well, you don't act as though you did. Next time when I want any help  I may have to bring Rad with me.\"    \"Oh, no, Master! Not that old man. He don't know how to help Master.  Koku do just what Master say.\"    \"Like fun you do,\" said Tom, still apparently very angry with the  simple-minded giant. \"Get back into the car and sit still, if you can,  until we get to Mr. Damon's house.\" Then to himself he added: \"I don't  blame that fellow, whoever he is, for lighting out.
