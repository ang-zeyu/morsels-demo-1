Where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#8)"],[1," spoke or even seemed to breathe, so great was the silence for  wonder what he would do.  Meanwhile, also, quite still stood the  stranger, holding his bow in his hand, while one could count five; then  he drew his trusty yew, holding it drawn but a moment, then loosed the  string. Straight flew the arrow, and so true that it smote a gray goose  feather from off Gilbert's shaft, which fell fluttering through the  sunlit air as the stranger's arrow lodged close beside his of the Red  Cap, and in the very center. No one spoke a word for a while and no one  shouted, but each man looked into his neighbor's face amazedly.    \"Nay,\" quoth old Adam o' the Dell presently, drawing a long breath and  shaking his head as he spoke, \"twoscore years and more have I shot  shaft, and maybe not all times bad, but I shoot no more this day, for no  man can match with yon stranger, whosoe'er he may be.\" Then he thrust  his shaft into his quiver, rattling, and unstrung his bow without  another word.    Then the Sheriff came down from his dais and drew near, in all his silks  and velvets, to where the tattered stranger stood leaning upon his stout  bow, while the good folk crowded around to see the man who shot so  wondrously well.  \"Here, good fellow,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"take thou the  prize, and well and fairly hast thou won it, I bow. What may be thy  name, and whence comest thou?\"    \"Men do call me Jock o' Teviotdale, and thence am I come,\" said the  stranger.    \"Then, by Our Lady, Jock, thou art the fairest archer that e'er mine  eyes beheld, and if thou wilt join my service I will clothe thee with a  better coat than that thou hast upon thy back; thou shalt eat and drink  of the best, and at every Christmastide fourscore marks shall be thy  wage. I trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave Robin  Hood, that dared not show his face here this day.  Say, good fellow,  wilt thou join my service?\"    \"Nay, that will I not,\" quoth the stranger roughly. \"I will be mine own,  and no man in all merry England shall be my master.\"    \"Then get thee gone, and a murrain seize thee!\" cried the Sheriff, and  his voice trembled with anger.  \"And by my faith and troth, I have a  good part of a mind to have thee beaten for thine insolence!\" Then he  turned upon his heel and strode away.    It was a right motley company that gathered about the noble greenwood  tree in Sherwood's depths that same day. A score and more of barefoot  friars were there, and some that looked like tinkers, and some that  seemed to be sturdy beggars and rustic hinds; and seated upon a mossy  couch was one all clad in tattered scarlet, with a patch over one eye;  and in his hand he held the golden arrow that was the prize of the great  shooting match.  Then, amidst a noise of talking and laughter, he took  the patch from off his eye and stripped away the scarlet rags from off  his body and showed himself all clothed in fair Lincoln green; and quoth  he, \"Easy come these things away, but walnut stain cometh not so  speedily from yellow hair.\" Then all laughed louder than before, for it  was Robin Hood himself that had won the prize from the Sheriff's very  hands.    Then all sat down to the woodland feast and talked among themselves of  the merry jest that had been played upon the Sheriff, and of the  adventures that had befallen each member of the band in his disguise.  But when the feast was done, Robin Hood took Little John apart and said,  \"Truly am I vexed in my blood, for I heard the Sheriff say today, 'Thou  shootest better than that coward knave Robin Hood, that dared not show  his face here this day.'  I would fain let him know who it was who won  the golden arrow from out his hand, and also that I am no coward such as  he takes me to be.\"    Then Little John said, \"Good master, take thou me and Will Stutely, and  we will send yon fat Sheriff news of all this by a messenger such as he  doth not expect.\"    That day the Sheriff sat at meat in the great hall of his house at  Nottingham Town.  Long tables stood down the hall, at which sat men-at-  arms and household servants and good stout villains,[Bond-servants.] in  all fourscore and more.  There they talked of the day's shooting as they  ate their meat and quaffed their ale. The Sheriff sat at the head of the  table upon a raised seat under a canopy, and beside him sat his dame.    \"By my troth,\" said he, \"I did reckon full roundly that that knave Robin  Hood would be at the game today.  I did not think that he was such a  coward. But who could that saucy knave be who answered me to my beard so  bravely? I wonder that I did not have him beaten; but there was  something about him that spoke of other things than rags and tatters.\"    Then, even as he finished speaking, something fell rattling among the  dishes on the table, while those that sat near started up wondering what  it might be.  After a while one of the men-at-arms gathered courage  enough to pick it up and bring it to the Sheriff.  Then everyone saw  that it was a blunted gray goose shaft, with a fine scroll, about the  thickness of a goose quill, tied near to its head. The Sheriff opened  the scroll and glanced at it, while the veins upon his forehead swelled  and his cheeks grew ruddy with rage as he read, for this was what he  saw:         \"_Now Heaven bless Thy Grace this day       Say all in sweet Sherwood       For thou didst give the prize away       To merry Robin Hood_.\"    \"Whence came this?\" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice.  \"Even through the window, Your Worship,\" quoth the man who had handed  the shaft to him.          Will Stutely Rescued by His Companions    NOW WHEN THE SHERIFF found that neither law nor guile could overcome  Robin Hood, he was much perplexed, and said to himself, \"Fool that I am!  Had I not told our King of Robin Hood, I would not have gotten myself  into such a coil; but now I must either take him captive or have wrath  visited upon my head from his most gracious Majesty.  I have tried law,  and I have tried guile, and I have failed in both; so I will try what  may be done with might.\"    Thus communing within himself, he called his constables together and  told them what was in his mind.  \"Now take ye each four men, all armed  in proof,\" said he, \"and get ye gone to the forest, at different points,  and lie in wait for this same Robin Hood.  But if any constable finds  too many men against him, let him sound a horn, and then let each band  within hearing come with all speed and join the party that calls them.  Thus, I think, shall we take this green-clad knave.  Furthermore, to him  that first meeteth with Robin Hood shall one hundred pounds of silver  money be given, if he be brought to me dead or alive; and to him that  meeteth with any of his band shall twoscore pounds be given, if such be  brought to me dead or alive. So, be ye bold and be ye crafty.\"    So thus they went in threescore companies of five to Sherwood Forest, to  take Robin Hood, each constable wishing that he might be the one to find  the bold outlaw, or at least one of his band. For seven days and nights  they hunted through the forest glades, but never saw so much as a single  man in Lincoln green; for tidings of all this had been brought to Robin  Hood by trusty Eadom o' the Blue Boar.    When he first heard the news, Robin said, \"If the Sheriff dare send  force to meet force, woe will it be for him and many a better man  besides, for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all.  But fain would I shun blood and battle, and fain would I not deal sorrow  to womenfolk and wives because good stout yeomen lose their lives. Once  I slew a man, and never do I wish to slay a man again, for it is bitter  for the soul to think thereon.  So now we will abide silently in  Sherwood Forest, so that it may be well for all, but should we be forced  to defend ourselves, or any of our band, then let each man draw bow and  brand with might and main.\"    At this speech many of the band shook their heads, and said to  themselves, \"Now the Sheriff will think that we are cowards, and folk  will scoff throughout the countryside, saying that we fear to meet these  men.\" But they said nothing aloud, swallowing their words and doing as  Robin bade them.    Thus they hid in the depths of Sherwood Forest for seven days and seven  nights and never showed their faces abroad in all that time; but early  in the morning of the eighth day Robin Hood called the band together and  said, \"Now who will go and find what the Sheriff's men are at by this  time? For I know right well they will not bide forever within Sherwood  shades.\"    At this a great shout arose, and each man waved his bow aloft and cried  that he might be the one to go.  Then Robin Hood's heart was proud when  he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, \"Brave and  true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows  are ye, but ye cannot all go, so I will choose one from among you, and  it shall be good Will Stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox  in Sherwood Forest.\"    Then Will Stutely leaped high aloft and laughed loudly, clapping his  hands for pure joy that he should have been chosen from among them all.  \"Now thanks, good master,\" quoth he, \"and if I bring not news of those  knaves to thee, call me no more thy sly Will Stutely.\"    Then he clad himself in a friar's gown, and underneath the robe he hung  a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hands upon  it. Thus clad, he set forth upon his quest, until he came to the verge  of the forest, and so to the highway.  He saw two bands of the Sheriff's  men, yet he turned neither to the right nor the left, but only drew his  cowl the closer over his face, folding his hands as if in meditation. So  at last he came to the Sign of the Blue Boar.  \"For,\" quoth he to  himself, \"our good friend Eadom will tell me all the news.\"    At the Sign of the Blue Boar he found a"]]]
