[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#8)"],[1,"         XXXIV.    A shady friend for torrid days  Is easier to find  Than one of higher temperature  For frigid hour of mind.    The vane a little to the east  Scares muslin souls away;  If broadcloth breasts are firmer  Than those of organdy,    Who is to blame? The weaver?  Ah! the bewildering thread!  The tapestries of paradise  So notelessly are made!            XXXV.    THE GOAL.    Each life converges to some centre  Expressed or still;  Exists in every human nature  A goal,    Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,  Too fair  For credibility's temerity  To dare.    Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,  To reach  Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment  To touch,    Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;  How high  Unto the saints' slow diligence  The sky!    Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,  But then,  Eternity enables the endeavoring  Again.            XXXVI.    SIGHT.    Before I got my eye put out,  I liked as well to see  As other creatures that have eyes,  And know no other way.    But were it told to me, to-day,  That I might have the sky  For mine, I tell you that my heart  Would split, for size of me.    The meadows mine, the mountains mine, --  All forests, stintless stars,  As much of noon as I could take  Between my finite eyes.    The motions of the dipping birds,  The lightning's jointed road,  For mine to look at when I liked, --  The news would strike me dead!    So safer, guess, with just my soul  Upon the window-pane  Where other creatures put their eyes,  Incautious of the sun.            XXXVII.    Talk with prudence to a beggar  Of 'Potosi' and the mines!  Reverently to the hungry  Of your viands and your wines!    Cautious, hint to any captive  You have passed enfranchised feet!  Anecdotes of air in dungeons  Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!            XXXVIII.    THE PREACHER.    He preached upon \"breadth\" till it argued him narrow, --  The broad are too broad to define;  And of \"truth\" until it proclaimed him a liar, --  The truth never flaunted a sign.    Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence  As gold the pyrites would shun.  What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus  To meet so enabled a man!            XXXIX.    Good night! which put the candle out?  A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.     Ah! friend, you little knew  How long at that celestial wick  The angels labored diligent;     Extinguished, now, for you!    It might have been the lighthouse spark  Some sailor, rowing in the dark,     Had importuned to see!  It might have been the waning lamp  That lit the drummer from the camp     To purer reveille!            XL.    When I hoped I feared,  Since I hoped I dared;  Everywhere alone  As a church remain;  Spectre cannot harm,  Serpent cannot charm;  He deposes doom,  Who hath suffered him.            XLI.    DEED.    A deed knocks first at thought,  And then it knocks at will.  That is the manufacturing spot,  And will at home and well.    It then goes out an act,  Or is entombed so still  That only to the ear of God  Its doom is audible.            XLII.    TIME'S LESSON.    Mine enemy is growing old, --  I have at last revenge.  The palate of the hate departs;  If any would avenge, --    Let him be quick, the viand flits,  It is a faded meat.  Anger as soon as fed is dead;  'T is starving makes it fat.            XLIII.    REMORSE.    Remorse is memory awake,  Her companies astir, --  A presence of departed acts  At window and at door.    It's past set down before the soul,  And lighted with a match,  Perusal to facilitate  Of its condensed despatch.    Remorse is cureless, -- the disease  Not even God can heal;  For 't is his institution, --  The complement of hell.            XLIV.    THE SHELTER.    The body grows outside, --  The more convenient way, --  That if the spirit like to hide,  Its temple stands alway    Ajar, secure, inviting;  It never did betray  The soul that asked its shelter  In timid honesty.            XLV.    Undue significance a starving man attaches  To food  Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,  And therefore good.    Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us  That spices fly  In the receipt. It was the distance  Was savory.            XLVI.    Heart not so heavy as mine,  Wending late home,  As it passed my window  Whistled itself a tune, --    A careless snatch, a ballad,  A ditty of the street;  Yet to my irritated ear  An anodyne so sweet,    It was as if a bobolink,  Sauntering this way,  Carolled and mused and carolled,  Then bubbled slow away.    It was as if a chirping brook  Upon a toilsome way  Set bleeding feet to minuets  Without the knowing why.    To-morrow, night will come again,  Weary, perhaps, and sore.  Ah, bugle, by my window,  I pray you stroll once more!            XLVII.    I many times thought peace had come,  When peace was far away;  As wrecked men deem they sight the land  At centre of the sea,    And struggle slacker, but to prove,  As hopelessly as I,  How many the fictitious shores  Before the harbor lie.            XLVIII.    Unto my books so good to turn  Far ends of tired days;  It half endears the abstinence,  And pain is missed in praise.    As flavors cheer retarded guests  With banquetings to be,  So spices stimulate the time  Till my small library.    It may be wilderness without,  Far feet of failing men,  But holiday excludes the night,  And it is bells within.    I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;  Their countenances bland  Enamour in prospective,  And satisfy, obtained.            XLIX.    This merit hath the worst, --  It cannot be again.  When Fate hath taunted last  And thrown her furthest stone,    The maimed may pause and breathe,  And glance securely round.  The deer invites no longer  Than it eludes the hound.            L.    HUNGER.    I had been hungry all the years;  My noon had come, to dine;  I, trembling, drew the table near,  And touched the curious wine.    'T was this on tables I had seen,  When turning, hungry, lone,  I looked in windows, for the wealth  I could not hope to own.    I did not know the ample bread,  'T was so unlike the crumb  The birds and I had often shared  In Nature's dining-room.    The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, --  Myself felt ill and odd,  As berry of a mountain bush  Transplanted to the road.    Nor was I hungry; so I found  That hunger was a way  Of persons outside windows,  The entering takes away.            LI.    I gained it so,        By climbing slow,  By catching at the twigs that grow  Between the bliss and me.        It hung so high,        As well the sky        Attempt by strategy.      I said I gained it, --        This was all.  Look, how I clutch it,        Lest it fall,  And I a pauper go;  Unfitted by an instant's grace  For the contented beggar's face  I wore an hour ago.            LII.    To learn the transport by the pain,  As blind men learn the sun;  To die of thirst, suspecting  That brooks in meadows run;    To stay the homesick, homesick feet  Upon a foreign shore  Haunted by native lands, the while,  And blue, beloved air --    This is the sovereign anguish,  This, the signal woe!  These are the patient laureates  Whose voices, trained below,    Ascend in ceaseless carol,  Inaudible, indeed,  To us, the duller scholars  Of the mysterious bard!            LIII.    RETURNING.    I years had been from home,  And now, before the door,  I dared not open, lest a face  I never saw before    Stare vacant into mine  And ask my business there.  My business, -- just a life I left,  Was such still dwelling there?    I fumbled at my nerve,  I scanned the windows near;  The silence like an ocean rolled,  And broke against my ear.    I laughed a wooden laugh  That I could fear a door,  Who danger and the dead had faced,  But never quaked before.    I fitted to the latch  My hand, with trembling care,  Lest back the awful door should spring,  And leave me standing there.    I moved my fingers off  As cautiously as glass,  And held my ears, and like a thief  Fled gasping from the house.            LIV.    PRAYER.    Prayer is the little implement  Through which men reach  Where presence is denied them.  They fling their speech    By means of it in God's ear;  If then He hear,  This sums the apparatus  Comprised in prayer.            LV.    I know that he exists  Somewhere, in silence.  He has hid his rare life  From our gross eyes.    'T is an instant's play,  'T is a fond ambush,  Just to make bliss  Earn her own surprise!    But should the play  Prove piercing earnest,  Should the glee glaze  In death's stiff stare,    Would not the fun  Look too expensive?  Would not the jest  Have crawled too far?            LVI.    MELODIES UNHEARD.    Musicians wrestle everywhere:  All day, among the crowded air,    I hear the silver strife;  And -- waking long before the dawn --  Such transport breaks upon the town    I think it that \"new life!\"    It is not bird, it has no nest;  Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,    Nor tambourine, nor man;  It is not hymn from pulpit read, --  The morning stars the treble led    On time's first afternoon!    Some say it is the spheres at play!  Some say that bright majority    Of vanished dames and men!  Some think it service in the place  Where we, with late, celestial face,    Please God, shall ascertain!            LVII.    CALLED BACK.    Just lost when I was saved!  Just felt the world go by!  Just girt me for the onset with eternity,  When breath blew back,  And on the other side  I heard recede the disappointed tide!    Therefore, as one returned, I feel,  Odd secrets of the line to tell!  Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,  Some pale reporter from the awful doors  Before the seal!    Next time, to stay!  Next time, the things to see  By ear unheard,  Unscrutinized by eye.    Next time, to tarry,  While the ages steal, --  Slow tramp the centuries,  And the cycles wheel.              II. LOVE.      I.    CHOICE.    Of all the souls that stand create  I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#8)"],[1,"  'Twas pleasant indeed when I was at Rome to say here stood the  Capitol, there the Colossus of Nero, here was the Amphitheatre of  Titus, there the Aqueduct of----, here the Forum, there the Catacombs,  here the Temple of Venus, there of Jupiter, here the Pantheon, and the  like; but I never designed to write a book. As much as was useful I  kept in my head, and for the rest, I left it to others.    I observed the people degenerated from the ancient glorious  inhabitants, who were generous, brave, and the most valiant of all  nations, to a vicious baseness of soul, barbarous, treacherous,  jealous and revengeful, lewd and cowardly, intolerably proud and  haughty, bigoted to blind, incoherent devotion, and the grossest of  idolatry.    Indeed, I think the unsuitableness of the people made the place  unpleasant to me, for there is so little in a country to recommend it  when the people disgrace it, that no beauties of the creation can make  up for the want of those excellencies which suitable society procure  the defect of. This made Italy a very unpleasant country to me;  the people were the foil to the place, all manner of hateful vices  reigning in their general way of living.    I confess I was not very religious myself, and being come abroad into  the world young enough, might easily have been drawn into evils that  had recommended themselves with any tolerable agreeableness to nature  and common manners; but when wickedness presented itself full-grown in  its grossest freedoms and liberties, it quite took away all the gust  to vice that the devil had furnished me with.    The prodigious stupid bigotry of the people also was irksome to me; I  thought there was something in it very sordid. The entire empire the  priests have over both the souls and bodies of the people, gave me a  specimen of that meanness of spirit, which is nowhere else to be seen  but in Italy, especially in the city of Rome.    At Venice I perceived it quite different, the civil authority having  a visible superiority over the ecclesiastic, and the Church being more  subject there to the State than in any other part of Italy.    For these reasons I took no pleasure in filling my memoirs of Italy  with remarks of places or things. All the antiquities and valuable  remains of the Roman nation are done better than I can pretend to by  such people who made it more their business; as for me, I went to see,  and not to write, and as little thought then of these Memoirs as I ill  furnished myself to write them.    I left Italy in April, and taking the tour of Bavaria, though very  much out of the way, I passed through Munich, Passau, Lintz, and at  last to Vienna.    I came to Vienna the 10th of April 1631, intending to have gone from  thence down the Danube into Hungary, and by means of a pass, which I  had obtained from the English ambassador at Constantinople, I designed  to have seen all the great towns on the Danube, which were then in the  hands of the Turks, and which I had read much of in the history of  the war between the Turks and the Germans; but I was diverted from my  design by the following occasion.    There had been a long bloody war in the empire of Germany for twelve  years, between the emperor, the Duke of Bavaria, the King of  Spain, and the Popish princes and electors on the one side, and the  Protestant princes on the other; and both sides having been exhausted  by the war, and even the Catholics themselves beginning to dislike the  growing power of the house of Austria, 'twas thought all parties were  willing to make peace. Nay, things were brought to that pass that some  of the Popish princes and electors began to talk of making alliances  with the King of Sweden.    Here it is necessary to observe, that the two Dukes of Mecklenburg  having been dispossessed of most of their dominions by the tyranny  of the Emperor Ferdinand, and being in danger of losing the rest,  earnestly solicited the King of Sweden to come to their assistance;  and that prince, as he was related to the house of Mecklenburg, and  especially as he was willing to lay hold of any opportunity to break  with the emperor, against whom he had laid up an implacable prejudice,  was very ready and forward to come to their assistance.    The reasons of his quarrel with the emperor were grounded upon the  Imperialists concerning themselves in the war of Poland, where the  emperor had sent 8000 foot and 2000 horse to join the Polish army  against the king, and had thereby given some check to his arms in that  war.    In pursuance, therefore, of his resolution to quarrel with the  emperor, but more particularly at the instances of the princes  above-named, his Swedish Majesty had landed the year before at  Stralsund with about 12,000 men, and having joined with some forces  which he had left in Polish Prussia, all which did not make 30,000  men, he began a war with the emperor, the greatest in event, filled  with the most famous battles, sieges, and extraordinary actions,  including its wonderful success and happy conclusion, of any war ever  maintained in the world.    The King of Sweden had already taken Stettin, Stralsund, Rostock,  Wismar, and all the strong places on the Baltic, and began to spread  himself in Germany. He had made a league with the French, as I  observed in my story of Saxony; he had now made a treaty with the Duke  of Brandenburg, and, in short, began to be terrible to the empire.    In this conjuncture the emperor called the General Diet of the empire  to be held at Ratisbon, where, as was pretended, all sides were  to treat of peace and to join forces to beat the Swedes out of the  empire. Here the emperor, by a most exquisite management, brought the  affairs of the Diet to a conclusion, exceedingly to his own advantage,  and to the farther oppression of the Protestants; and, in particular,  in that the war against the King of Sweden was to be carried on in  such manner as that the whole burden and charge would lie on the  Protestants themselves, and they be made the instruments to oppose  their best friends. Other matters also ended equally to their  disadvantage, as the methods resolved on to recover the Church lands,  and to prevent the education of the Protestant clergy; and what  remained was referred to another General Diet to be held at  Frankfort-au-Main in August 1631.    I won't pretend to say the other Protestant princes of Germany had  never made any overtures to the King of Sweden to come to their  assistance, but 'tis plain they had entered into no league with him;  that appears from the difficulties which retarded the fixing of the  treaties afterward, both with the Dukes of Brandenburg and Saxony,  which unhappily occasioned the ruin of Magdeburg.    But 'tis plain the Swede was resolved on a war with the emperor. His  Swedish majesty might, and indeed could not but foresee that if he  once showed himself with a sufficient force on the frontiers of the  empire, all the Protestant princes would be obliged by their interest  or by his arms to fall in with him, and this the consequence made  appear to be a just conclusion, for the Electors of Brandenburg and  Saxony were both forced to join with him.    First, they were willing to join with him--at least they could not  find in their hearts to join with the emperor, of whose power they  had such just apprehensions. They wished the Swedes success, and would  have been very glad to have had the work done at another man's charge,  but, like true Germans, they were more willing to be saved than to  save themselves, and therefore hung back and stood upon terms.    Secondly, they were at last forced to it. The first was forced to join  by the King of Sweden himself, who being come so far was not to be  dallied with, and had not the Duke of Brandenburg complied as he did,  he had been ruined by the Swede. The Saxon was driven into the arms  of the Swede by force, for Count Tilly, ravaging his country, made him  comply with any terms to be saved from destruction.    Thus matters stood at the end of the Diet at Ratisbon. The King  of Sweden began to see himself leagued against at the Diet both by  Protestant and Papist; and, as I have often heard his Majesty say  since, he had resolved to try to force them off from the emperor, and  to treat them as enemies equally with the rest if they did not.    But the Protestants convinced him soon after, that though they  were tricked into the outward appearance of a league against him at  Ratisbon, they had no such intentions; and by their ambassadors to him  let him know that they only wanted his powerful assistance to defend  their councils, when they would soon convince him that they had a due  sense of the emperor's designs, and would do their utmost for their  liberty. And these I take to be the first invitations the King of  Sweden had to undertake the Protestant cause as such, and which  entitled him to say he fought for the liberty and religion of the  German nation.    I have had some particular opportunities to hear these things form the  mouths of some of the very princes themselves, and therefore am the  forwarder to relate them; and I place them here because, previous  to the part I acted on this bloody scene, 'tis necessary to let the  reader into some part of that story, and to show him in what manner  and on what occasions this terrible war began.    The Protestants, alarmed at the usage they had met with at the former  Diet, had secretly proposed among themselves to form a general union  or confederacy, for preventing that ruin which they saw, unless some  speedy remedies were applied, would be inevitable. The Elector of  Saxony, the head of the Protestants, a vigorous and politic prince,  was the first that moved it; and the Landgrave of Hesse, a zealous and  gallant prince, being consulted with, it rested a great while between  those two, no method being found practicable to bring it to pass, the  emperor being so"]]]
