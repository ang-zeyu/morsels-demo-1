Besides, I would have said nothing on  Panoria's account. She did not lie.\"    \"No more did Eliza,\" said Joseph.    \"Bah, imbecile!\" said Napoleon, turning on his brother. \"Where, then, is  the difference between telling a lie and acting one by keeping quiet, if  both mislead?\"    You can readily believe that Napoleon was made much of by all his family  because of his action. \"That is the stuff that makes brave soldiers,  leaders, and patriots, my son,\" his \"Mamma Letitia\" said. \"Would that we  all had more of it!\"    For Madame Bonaparte knew that there was but little of the heroic in her  handsome husband, \"Papa Charles.\" He would flame out with wrath, and  tell every one how much he meant to do against tyranny and wrong; he  would even act with courage for a while; but at last his love of ease  and his dislike of trouble would get the better of his valor, and he  would give up the struggle, bow before his opponents, and seek to gain  by subserviency their favor and patronage.    As for Eliza, she received a merited punishment--first, for her  disobedience in taking what she had been told never to touch; next, for  her bravado in daring to act insolently toward her uncle, the canon;  then for her gluttony in eating so much of the fruit; and finally, for  her \"bad heart,\" as her mother called it, for allowing her brother  to suffer in her stead, and be punished for the wrong that she had  committed.    As for Napoleon, I fear that this little incident in his life made him  feel more important than ever. He assumed a yet more masterful tone  toward his companions and playmates, lorded it over Joseph, his brother,  and made repeated demands for loyalty upon Uncle Joey Fesch.    But he did feel grateful toward Panoria for her timely word and generous  conduct. He became more fond than ever of \"La Giacommeta;\" and he  brought her fruit and flowers, told her of all the great things he meant  to do \"when he was a man,\" and even invited her into his much loved and  jealously guarded grotto; and that, you may be sure, was a very great  favor for Napoleon to grant. For his grotto was his own private and  exclusive hermitage.          CHAPTER SIX.    THE BATTLE WITH THE SHEPHERD BOYS.    The relations between Napoleon and the shepherd boys of the Ajaccio  hillsides were not improved by his unsatisfactory food-trade during his  bread-and-water days.    Whenever he took his walks abroad in their direction, the belligerent  shepherd boys made haste to annoy and attack him. They had no special  love for the town boys; there was, in fact, a long-standing rivalry  and quarrel between them, as there often is between boys of different  sections, or between boys of the country and the town.    So you may be sure that Napoleon's solitary tramps along the hillsides  were often disturbed and made unpleasant.    At last he determined upon the punishment or discomfiture of the  shepherd boys. He roused his playmates to action; and one day they  sallied forth in a body, to surprise and attack the shepherd boys. But  there must have been a traitor in the camp of the town boys; for, when  they reached the hill pastures, they not only found the shepherd boys  prepared for them, but they found them arrayed in force. Before the town  boys could rush to the attack, the shepherd boys, eager for the fray,  \"took the initiative,\" as the war records say, and making a dash upon  the town boys, drove them ignominiously from the field.    Napoleon disliked a check. Discomfited and mortified, he turned on big  Andrew Pozzo, the leader of the town boys.    \"Why, you are no general!\" he cried. \"You should have massed us all  together, and held up firm against the shepherds. But, instead, you  scattered us all; and as for you--you ran faster than any of us!\"    \"Ho! little gamecock! little boaster!\" answered Pozzo hotly. \"You  know it all, do you not? You'd better try it yourself, Captain  Down-at-the-heel.\"    \"And I will, then!\" cried Napoleon. \"Come, boys, try it again! Shall we  be whipped by a lot of shepherd boys, garlic lovers, eaters of chestnut  bread? Never! Follow me!\" But the town boys had received all they  wished, for one day. Only a portion of them followed Napoleon's lead;  and they turned about and fled before they even met the shepherd boys,  so formidable seemed the array of those warriors of the hills.    \"Why, this will never do!\" Napoleon exclaimed. \"It must not be said that  we town boys have been whipped into slavery by these miserable ones of  the mountains. At them again! What! You will not? Then let us arrange a  careful plan of attack, and try them another day. Will you do so?\"    The boys promised; for it is always easy to agree to do a thing at some  later day. But Napoleon did not intend that the matter should be given  up or postponed. He went to his grotto, and carefully thought out a plan  of campaign.    The next day he gathered his forces about him, and endeavored to fire  their hearts by a little theatrical effect.    \"What say you, boys, to a cartel?\" he said.    \"A cartel?\"    \"Yes; a challenge to those miserable ones of the hill, daring them to  battle.\"    \"But those hill dwellers cannot read; do you not know that, you silly?\"  Andrew Pozzo cried. \"How, then, can you send a challenge?\"    \"How but by word of mouth?\" replied Napoleon. \"See, here are Uncle Joey  Fesch and big Ilari; they shall go with their sticks, and stand before  those shepherd boys, and shall cry aloud\"--    \"Shall we, then?\" broke in big Ilari. \"I will do no crying.\"    Napoleon said nothing. He simply looked at the big fellow--looked at  him--and went on as if there had been no interruption,--    \"And shall cry aloud, 'Holo, miserable ones! holo, rascal shepherds! The  town boys dare you to fight them. Are you cowards, or will you meet them  in battle?' This shall Uncle Joey Fesch cry out. He has a mighty voice.\"    \"And of course they will fight,\" sneered Andrew Pozzo. \"Did you think  they would not? But shall we?\"    \"Shall we not, then?\" answered Napoleon. \"And if you will but follow and  obey me, we will conquer those hill boys, as you never could if Pozzo  led you on. For I will show you the trick of mastery. Of mastery, do you  hear? And those miserable boys of the sheep pastures shall never more  play the victor over us boys of the town.\"    It was worth trying, and the boys of that day and time were accustomed  to give and take hard knocks.    So Uncle Joey Fesch and big Tony Ilari, the bearers of the challenge,  set off for the hill pastures; and while they were gone Napoleon  directed the preparations of his forces.    The heralds returned with an answer of defiance from the hill boys.    \"So! they boast, do they?\" little Napoleon said. \"We will show them  how skill is better than strength. Remember my orders: stones in your  pockets, the stick in your hand. Attention! In order! March!\"    In excellent order the little army set out for the hills. In the  pastures where they had met defeat the day before they saw the  straggling forces of the shepherd boys awaiting them.    \"Halt!\" commanded the Captain Napoleon.    \"Let the challengers go forward again,\" he directed. \"Summon them to  surrender, and pass under the yoke. Tell them we will be masters in  Ajaccio.\"    The big boy challengers obeyed the little leader's command; and as they  departed on their mission Napoleon ordered his soldiers to quietly drop  the stones they carried in their pockets, in a line where they stood.  Then he planted a stick in the ground as a guide-post.    The challengers came rushing back, followed by the jeers and sticks of  the hill boys.    \"So! they will not yield? Then will we conquer them,\" Napoleon cried.  \"In order! Charge!\"    And up the slope, brandishing their sticks, charged the town boys.    The hill boys were ready for them. They were bigger and stronger than  the town boys, and they expected to conquer by force.    The two parties met. There was a brief rattle of stick against stick.  But the hill boys were the stronger, and Napoleon gave the order to  retreat.    Down the hill rushed the town boys. After them, pell-mell, came the hill  boys, flushed with victory and careless of consequences. Suddenly, as  Napoleon reached his guide-post, he shouted in his shrill little voice,  \"Halt!\" And his army, knowing his intentions, instantly obeyed.    \"Stones!\" he cried, and they scooped up their supply of ammunition.    \"About!\" They faced the oncoming foe.    \"Fire!\" came his final order; and, so fast and furious fell the shower  of stones upon the surprised and unprepared hill boys, that their  victorious columns halted, wavered, turned, broke, and fled.    \"Now! upon them! follow them! drive them!\" rang out the little Captain  Napoleon's swiftly given orders.    They followed his lead. The hill boys, utterly routed, scattered in  dismay. One-half of them were captured and held as prisoners, until  Napoleon's two big challengers, now acting as commissioners of  conquest, received from the hill boys an unconditional surrender, an  acknowledgment of the superiority of the town boys, and the humble  promise to molest them no more.    This was Napoleon's first taste of victorious war. But ever after he  was an acknowledged leader of the boys of Ajaccio. Andrew Pozzo was  unceremoniously deposed from his self-assumed post of commander in all  street feuds and forays. The old rivalry was a sore point with him,  however; and throughout his life he was the bitter and determined  opponent of his famous fellow-Corsican, Napoleon. But you may be sure  big Tony Ilari and the other boys paid court to the little Bonaparte's  ability; while as for Uncle Joey Fesch, he was prouder than ever of his  nine-year-old nephew and commander.          CHAPTER SEVEN.    GOOD-BYE TO CORSICA.    Meantime things were going from bad to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#7)"],[1,"you. I only hope you don't learn what it is until we  get at that sunken treasure, though.\"    But alas for Tom's hopes. Mr. Berg did learn of the object of the  treasure-seekers, and sought to defeat them, as we shall learn as our  story proceeds.          Chapter Six    Turning the Tables      When the young inventor informed his father what he had overheard Mr.  Berg saying, the aged inventor was not as much worried as his son  anticipated.    \"All we'll have to do, Tom,\" he said, \"is to keep quiet about where we  are going. Once we have the Advance afloat, and try her out, we can  start on our voyage for the South American Coast and search for the  sunken treasure. When we begin our voyage under water I defy any one to  tell where we are going, or what our plans are. No, I don't believe we  need worry about Mr. Berg, though he probably means mischief.\"    \"Well, I'm going to keep my eyes open for him and Andy Foger,\" declared  Tom.    The days that followed were filled with work. Not only were there many  unexpected things to do about the submarine, but Mr. Sharp was kept  busy making inquiries about the sunken treasure ship. These inquiries  had to be made carefully, as the adventurers did not want their plans  talked of, and nothing circulates more quickly than rumors of an  expedition after treasure of any kind.    \"What about the old sea captain you were going to get to go with us?\"  asked Mr. Swift of the balloonist one afternoon.  \"Have you succeeded  in finding one yet?\"    \"Yes; I am in communication with a man I think will be just the person  for us. His name is Captain Alden Weston, and he has sailed all over  the world. He has also taken part in more than one revolution, and, in  fact, is a soldier of fortune. I do not know him personally, but a  friend of mine knows him, and says he will serve us faithfully. I have  written to him, and he will be here in a few days.\"    \"That's good. Now about the location of the wreck itself.  Have you  been able to learn any more details?\"    \"Well, not many. You see, the Boldero was abandoned in a storm, and the  captain did not take very careful observations. As nearly as it can be  figured out the treasure ship went to the bottom in latitude forty-five  degrees south, and longitude twenty-seven east from Washington. That's  a pretty indefinite location, but I hope, once we get off the Uruguay  coast, we can better it. We can anchor or lay outside the harbor, and  in the small boat we carry go ashore and possibly gain more details.  For it was at Montevideo that the shipwrecked passengers and sailors  landed.\"    \"Does Captain Weston know our object?\" inquired Tom.    \"No, and I don't propose to tell him until we are ready to start,\"  replied Mr. Sharp. \"I don't know just how he'll consider a submarine  trip after treasure, but if I spring it on him suddenly he's less  likely to back out. Oh, I think he'll go.\"    Somewhat unexpectedly the next day it was discovered that certain tools  and appliances were needed for the submarine, and they had been left in  the house at Shopton, where Eradicate Sampson was in charge as  caretaker during the absence of Mr. Swift and his son and the  housekeeper.    \"Well, I suppose we'll have to go back after them,\" remarked Tom.  \"We'll take the airship, dad, and make a two-days' trip of it. Is there  anything else you want?\"    \"Well, you might bring a bundle of papers you'll find in the lower  right hand drawer of my desk. They contain some memoranda I need.\"    Tom and Mr. Sharp had become so used to traveling in the airship that  it seemed no novelty to them, though they attracted much attention  wherever they went. They soon had the Red Cloud in readiness for a  flight, and rising in the air above the shop that contained the  powerful submarine, a craft utterly different in type from the  aeroplane, the nose of the airship was pointed toward Shopton.    They made a good flight and landed near the big shed where the bird of  the air was kept. It was early evening when they got to the Swift  homestead, and Eradicate Sampson was glad to see them.    Eradicate was a good cook, and soon had a meal ready for the travelers.  Then, while Mr. Sharp selected the tools and other things needed, and  put them in the airship ready for the start back the next morning, Tom  concluded he would take a stroll into Shopton, to see if he could see  his friend, Ned Newton. It was early evening, and the close of a  beautiful day, a sharp shower in the morning having cooled the air.    Tom was greeted by a number of acquaintances as he strolled along, for,  since the episode of the bank robbery, when he had so unexpectedly  returned with the thieves and the cash, the lad was better known than  ever.    \"I guess Ned must be home,\" thought our hero as he looked in vain for  his chum among the throng on the streets. \"I've got time to take a  stroll down to his house.\"    Tom was about to cross the street when he was startled by the sound of  an automobile horn loudly blown just at his side. Then a voice called:    \"Hey, there! Git out of the way if you don't want to be run over!\"    He looked up, and saw a car careening along. At the wheel was the  red-haired bully, Andy Foger, and in the tonneau were Sam Snedecker and  Pete Bailey.    \"Git out of the way,\" added Sam, and he grinned maliciously at Tom.    The latter stepped back, well out of the path of the car, which was not  moving very fast. Just in front of Tom was a puddle of muddy water.  There was no necessity for Andy steering into it, but he saw his  opportunity, and a moment later one of the big pneumatic tires had  plunged into the dirty fluid, spattering it all over Tom, some even  going as high as his face.    \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Andy. \"Maybe you'll get out of my way next time, Tom  Swift.\"    The young inventor was almost speechless from righteous anger. He wiped  the mud from his face, glanced down at his clothes, which were all but  ruined, and called out:    \"Hold on there, Andy Foger! I want to see you!\" for he thought of the  time when Andy had shut him in the tank.    \"Ta! ta!\" shouted Pete Bailey.    \"See you later,\" added Sam.    \"Better go home and take a bath, and then sail away in your submarine,\"  went on Andy. \"I'll bet it will sink.\"    Before Tom could reply the auto had turned a corner.  Disgusted and  angry, he tried to sop up some of the muddy water with his  handkerchief. While thus engaged he heard his name called, and looked  up to see Ned Newton.    \"What's the matter? Fall down?\" asked his chum.    \"Andy Foger,\" replied Tom.    \"That's enough,\" retorted Ned. \"I can guess the rest.  We'll have to  tar and feather him some day, and ride him out of town on a rail. I'd  kick him myself, only his father is a director in the bank where I  work, and I'd be fired if I did. Can't afford any such pleasure. But  some day I'll give Andy a good trouncing, and then resign before they  can discharge me. But I'll be looking for another job before I do that.  Come on to my house, Tom, and I'll help you clean up.\"    Tom was a little more presentable when he left his chum's residence,  after spending the evening there, but he was still burning for revenge  against Andy and his cronies. He had half a notion to go to Andy's  house and tell Mr. Foger how nearly serious the bully's prank at the  submarine had been, but he concluded that Mr. Foger could only uphold  his son. \"No, I'll settle with him myself,\" decided Tom.    Bidding Eradicate keep a watchful eye about the house, and leaving word  for Mr. Damon to be sure to come to the coast if he again called at the  Shopton house, Tom and Mr. Sharp prepared to make their return trip  early the next morning.    The gas tank was filled and the Red Cloud arose in the air. Then, with  the propellers moving at moderate speed, the nose of the craft was  pointed toward the New Jersey coast.    A few miles out from Shopton, finding there was a contrary wind in the  upper regions where they were traveling, Mr. Sharp descended several  hundred feet. They were moving over a sparsely settled part of the  country, and looking down, Tom saw, speeding along a highway, an  automobile.    \"I wonder who's in it?\" he remarked, taking down a telescope and  peering over the window ledge of the cabin.  The next moment he uttered  a startled exclamation.    \"Andy  Foger, Sam  Snedecker and Pete Bailey!\" he cried.  \"Oh, I wish I  had a bucket of water to empty on them.\"    \"I know a better way to get even with them than that,\" said Mr. Sharp.    \"How?\" asked Tom eagerly.    \"I'll show you,\" replied the balloonist. \"It's a trick I once played on  a fellow who did me an injury. Here, you steer for a minute until I get  the thing fixed, then I'll take charge.\"    Mr. Sharp went to the storeroom and came back with a long, stout rope  and a small anchor of four prongs. It was carried to be used in  emergencies, but so far had never been called into requisition.  Fastening the grapple to the cable, the balloonist said:    \"Now, Tom, they haven't seen you. You stand in the stern and pay out  the rope. I'll steer the airship, and what I want you to do is to catch  the anchor in the rear of their car. Then I'll show you some fun.\"    Tom followed instructions. Slowly he lowered the rope with the dangling  grapple. The airship was also sent down, as the cable was not quite  long enough to reach the earth from the height at which they were. The  engine was run at slow speed, so that the noise would not attract the  attention of the three cronies who were speeding along, all unconscious  of the craft in the air over their heads. The Red Cloud was moving in  the same direction as was the automobile.    The anchor was now close to the rear of Andy's car.  Suddenly it caught  on the tonneau and Tom called that fact to Mr. Sharp.    \"Fasten the rope at the cleat,\" directed the balloonist.    Tom did so, and a moment later the aeronaut sent the airship up by"]]]
