[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#8)"],[1,"sides are traversed from top to  bottom by several folds (about sixty), which, examined microscopically, are  seen to consist of secondary leaves, or _laminellae_.    Examined on the foot, deprived of its horny covering, the sensitive laminae  are, the majority of them, in close contact with each other. In the normal  state this is not so. The interstices between the leaves are then occupied  by the horny leaves, to be afterwards described as existing on the inner  surface of the wall.    Reaching and rounding the heels, the sensitive laminae extend forward for a  short distance, where they interleave with the horny laminae of the bars.    Much discussion has centred round the point as to whether or no the cells  of the sensitive laminae take any share in the formation of the horn of the  wall. This will be alluded to in a future chapter.      I. THE HOOF.    Removed from the foot by maceration a well-shaped hoof is cylindro-conical  in form, and appears to the ordinary observer to consist of a box or case  cast in one single piece of horn. Prolonged maceration, however, will show  that the apparently single piece is divisible into three. These are known  as (1) THE WALL, (2) THE SOLE, and (3) THE FROG. In addition to these, we  have also an appendage or circular continuation of the frog named (4) THE  PERIOPLE, or CORONARY FROG BAND. These various divisions we will study  separately.    1. THE WALL is that portion of the hoof seen in front and laterally when  the horse's foot is on the ground. Posteriorly, instead of being continued  round the heels to complete the circle, its extremities become suddenly  inflected downwards, forwards, and inwards. These inflections can only be  seen with the foot lifted from the floor, and form the so-called _Bars_. It  will be noticed, too, with the foot lifted, that the wall projects beyond  the level of the other structures of the plantar surface, taking upon  itself the bearing of the greatest part of the animal's weight.    The horn of the wall, viewed immediately from the front, is known as the  _Toe_, which again is distinguished as _Outside Toe_ or _Inside Toe_,  according as the horn to its inner or outer aspect is indicated. The  remainder of the external face of the wall, that running back to the heels,  is designated the _Quarters_.    In the middle region of the toe, the wall following the angle of the bones  is greatly oblique. This obliquity decreases as the quarters are reached,  until on reaching the heels the wall is nearly upright.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--THE WALL OF THE HOOF. 1, The toe; 2, inner toe; 3,  outside toe; 4, the quarter; 5, entigeral groove; 6, horny laminae.]    For observation the wall offers two faces, two borders, and two  extremities.    _The External Face_ is convex from side to side, but straight from the  upper to the lower border. Examined closely, it is seen to be made up of  closely-arranged parallel fibres running in a straight line from the upper  to the lower border, and giving the surface of the foot a finely striated  appearance. In addition to these lines, which are really the horn tubules,  the external face is marked by a series of rings which run horizontally  from heel to heel. These are due to varying influences of food, climate,  and slight or severe disease. This will be noted again in a later page. In  a young and healthy horse the whole of the external face of the wall  is smooth and shining. This appearance is due to a thin layer of horn,  secreted independently of the wall proper, termed the periople.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--INTERNAL FEATURES OF THE WALL, FROG, AND SOLE  (MESIAN SECTION OF HOOF). 1, Horny laminae covering internal face of wall;  2, superior border of wall; 3, junction of wall with horny sole; 4, the  cutigeral groove; 5, the horny sole; 6, the horny frog (that portion of  it known as the 'frog-stay'); 7, inverted V-shaped ridge on wall and sole  (known as the 'toe-stay'); 8, anterior face of wall; 9, inferior border of  wall.]    _The Internal Face_ of the wall, that adapted to the sensitive laminae,  is closely covered over its entire surface with white parallel leaves  _(Keraphyllae_, or horn leaves, to distinguish them from the _Podophyllae_,  or sensitive leaves). These keraphyllae dovetail intimately with the  sensitive laminae, covering the os pedis. Running along the superior portion  of the inner face is the _Cutigeral Groove_. This cavity has been mentioned  before as accommodating the coronary cushion, whose shape and general  contour it closely follows, being widest and deepest in front, and  gradually decreasing as it proceeds backwards. It is hollowed out at the  expense of the wall, and shows on its surface numberless minute openings  which receive the papillae of the coronary cushion.    At the bottom of the internal face, at the point where the toe joins the  sole, will be noted the before-mentioned inverted V-shaped prominence.  Its position will be clearly understood when we say that it gives the  appearance of having been forced there by the pressure of the toe-clip of  the shoe. This will be noted again when dealing with the sole.    _The Inferior Border_ of the wall offers little to note. It is that portion  in contact with the ground, and subject to wear. A point of interest is its  union with the sole. This will be noticed in a foot which has just been  pared as a narrow white or faint yellow line on the inner or concave face  of the wall at its lower portion. It marks the point where the horny leaves  of the wall terminate and become locked with corresponding leaves of the  circumference of the sole.    _The Superior Border_ follows closely the line marked by the perioplic ring  and the groove separating the latter from the coronary cushion.    _The Extremities_ of the wall are formed by the abruptly reflected portions  of the wall at the heels. Termed by some the 'Inflexural Nodes,' they are  better known to us as the '_Points of the Heels_.'    2. THE SOLE.--The sole is a thick plate of horn which, in conjunction  with the bars and the frog, forms the floor of the foot. In shape it is  irregularly crescentic, its posterior portion, that between the horns of  the crescent, being deeply indented in a V-shaped manner to receive the  frog. Its upper surface is convex, its lower concave. It may be recognised  as possessing two faces and two borders.    _The Superior or Internal Face_ is adapted to the sole of the os pedis. Its  highest point, therefore, is at the point of its V-shaped indentation. From  this point it slopes in every direction downwards and outwards until near  the circumference. Here it curves up to form a kind of a groove in which  is lodged the inferior edge of the os pedis. In the centre of its anterior  portion--that is to say, at the toe--will be seen a small inverted V-shaped  ridge, which is a direct continuation of the same shaped prominence before  mentioned on the internal face of the wall. This Fleming has termed the  toe-stay, from a notion that it serves to maintain the position of the os  pedis. The whole of the superior face of the sole is covered with numerous  fine punctures which receive the papillae of the sensitive sole.    _The Inferior Face_ is more or less concave according to circumstances, its  deepest part being at the point of the frog. Sloping from this point to its  circumference, it becomes suddenly flat just before joining the wall. Its  horn in appearance is flaky.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--INFERIOR ASPECT OF HOOF. _a_ The inferior face of  horny sole; _b_, inferior border of the wall; _c_, body or cushion of the  frog; _d_, median lacuna of the frog; _e_, lateral lacuna of the frog; _f_,  the bar; _g_, the quarter; _h_, the point of the frog; _i_ the heel.]    _The External Border_ or Circumference is intimately dovetailed with the  horny laminae of the wall. At its circumference the sole, if unpared, is  ordinarily as thick as the wall. This thickness is maintained for a short  distance towards its centre, after which it becomes gradually more thin.    _The Internal Border_ has the shape of an elongated V with the apex  pointing forwards. It is much thinner than the external border, and,  like it, is dovetailed into the horny laminae of the inflections of the  wall--namely, the bars. In front of the termination of the bars it is  dovetailed into the sides and point of the frog. Where unworn by contact  with the ground, the horn of the sole is shed by a process of exfoliation.    3. THE FROG.--Triangular or pyramidal in shape, the frog bears a close  resemblance to the form of the plantar cushion, upon the lower surface of  which body it is moulded. It offers for consideration two faces, two sides,  a base, and a point or summit.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--HOOF WITH THE SENSITIVE STRUCTURES REMOVED. 1,  Superior face of horny frog; 2, the frog-stay; 3, the lateral ridges of  the frog's superior surface; 4, the horny laminae at the inflections of the  wall.]    _The Superior Face_ is an exact cast of the lower surface of the plantar  cushion. It shows in the centre, therefore, a triangular depression, with  the base of the triangle directed backwards. Posteriorly, the depression  is continued as two lateral channels divided by a median ridge. The median  ridge widens out as it passes backwards, forming the larger part of the  posterior portion of the frog. This median ridge fits into the cleft of the  plantar cushion. It serves to prevent displacement of the sensitive from  the horny frog, and has been rather aptly termed the '_Frog-stay_.'    _The Inferior Surface_ is an exact reverse of the superior. The triangular  depression of the superior surface is represented in the inferior surface  by a triangular projection, and the ridge-like frog-stay of the upper  surface is represented below by a median cleft, the _Median Lacuna_ of the  frog. The triangular projection in front of the median lacuna is the  body or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#8)"],[1,"otmen, ushers and other servants  at the government house in Calcutta, at the viceregal lodge at  Simla, at the palace of the governor of Bombay, and the residences  of the other high officials, are all barefooted.    Everybody with experience agrees that well-trained Hindu servants  are quick, attentive and respectful and ingenious. F. Marion  Crawford in \"Mr. Isaacs\" says: \"It has always been a mystery  to me how native servants manage always to turn up at the right  moment. You say to your man, 'Go there and wait for me,' and you  arrive and find him waiting; though how he transferred himself  thither, with his queer-looking bundle, and his lota and cooking  utensils and your best teapot wrapped up in a newspaper and ready  for use, and with all the hundred and one things that a native  servant contrives to carry about without breaking or losing one of  them, is an unsolved puzzle. Yet there he is, clean and grinning  as ever, and if he were not clean and grinning and provided with  tea and cheroots, you would not keep him in your service a day,  though you would be incapable of looking half so spotless and  pleased under the same circumstances yourself.\"    Every upper servant in an Indian household has to have an under  servant to assist him. A butler will not wash dishes or dust or  sweep. He will go to market and wait on the table, but nothing  more. A cook must have a coolie to wash the kitchen utensils,  and wait on him. He will do nothing but prepare the food for  the table. A coachman will do nothing but drive. He must have  a coolie to take care of the horse, and if there are two horses  the owner must hire another stable man, for no Hindu hostler  can take care of more than one, at least he is not willing to  do so. An American friend has told me of his experience trying  to break down one of the customs of the East, and compelling  one native to groom two horses. It is too long and tearful to  relate here, for he was finally compelled to give in and hire  a man for every horse and prove the truth of Kipling's poem:      \"It is not good for the Christian race    To worry the Aryan brown;      For the white man riles,      And the brown man smiles,    And it weareth the Christian down      And the end of the fight      Is a tombstone white    With the name of the late deceased,      And the epitaph clear:      A fool lies here,    Who tried to hustle the East.\"    That's the fate of everybody who goes up against established customs.  And so we hired a \"bearer.\"    There were plenty of candidates. They appeared in swarms before  our trunks had come up from the steamer, and continued to come by  ones and twos until we had made a selection. They camped outside  our rooms and watched every movement we made. They sprang up in  our way from behind columns and gate-posts whenever we left the  hotel or returned to it. They accosted us in the street with  insinuating smiles and politely opened the carriage door as we  returned from our drives. They were of all sizes and ages, castes  and religions, and, strange to say, most of them had become  Christians and Protestants from their strong desire to please.  Each had a bunch of \"chits,\" as they call them--recommendations  from previous employers, testifying to their intelligence, honesty  and fidelity, and insisted upon our reading them. Finally, in  self-defense, we engaged a stalwart Mohammedan wearing a snow-white  robe, a monstrous turban and a big bushy beard. He is an imposing  spectacle; he moves like an emperor; his poses are as dignified  as those of the Sheik el Islam when he lifts his hands to bestow  a blessing. And we engaged Ram Zon Abdullet Mutmammet on his  shape.    It was a mistake. Beauty is skin deep. No one can judge merit by  outside appearances, as many persons can ascertain by glancing  in a mirror. Ram Zon, and that was what we called him for short,  was a splendid illusion. It turned out that he could not scrape  together enough English to keep an account of his expenditures  and had to trust to his memory, which is very defective in money  matters. He cannot read or write, he cannot carry a message or  receive one; he is no use as a guide, for, although information  and ideas may be bulging from his noble brow, he lacks the power  to communicate them, and, worse than all, he is surly, lazy and  a constitutional kicker. He was always hanging around when we  didn't want him, and when we did want him he was never to be  found.    Ram had not been engaged two hours before he appeared in our  sitting room, enveloped in a dignity that permeated the entire  hotel, stood erect like a soldier, brought his hand to his forehead  and held it there for a long time--the salute of great respect--and  gave me a sealed note, which I opened and found to read as follows:    \"Most Honored Sir:--I most humbly beg to inform you this to your  kind consideration and generousitee and trusting which will submit  myself to your grant benevolence for avoid the troublesomeness to  you and your families, that the servant Ram Zon you have been so  honorable and benovelent to engage is a great rogue and conjurer.  He will make your mind buzzling and will steal your properties,  and can run away with you midway. In proof you please touch his  right hand shoulder and see what and how big charm he has. Such  a bad temperature man you have in your service. Besides he only  grown up taller and looks like a dandee as it true but he is  not fit to act in case not to disappeared. I beg of you kindly  consult about those matters and select and choose much experienced  man than him otherwise certainly you could be put in to great  danger by his conjuring and into troubles.    \"Hoping to excuse me for this troubles I taking, though he is my  caste and countryman much like not to do so, but his temperature  is not good therefore liable to your honourablesness, etc., etc.\"    When I told Ram about this indictment, he stoutly denied the  charges, saying that it was customary for envious \"bearers\" to  say bad things of one another when they lost good jobs. We did not  feel of his right arm and he did not try to conjure us, but his  temperature is certainly very bad, and he soon became a nuisance,  which we abated by paying him a month's wages and sending him off.  Then, upon the recommendation of the consul we got a treasure,  although he does not show it in his looks.    The hotels of India have a very bad name. There are several good  ones in the empire, however, and every experienced traveler and  every clubman you meet can tell you the names of all of them.  Hence it is not impossible to keep a good hotel in India with  profit. The best are at Lucknow and Darjeeling. Those at Caucutta  are the worst, although one would think that the vice-regal capital  would have pride enough to entertain its many visitors decently.    Bombay at last has such a hotel as ought to be found in Calcutta  and all the other large cities, an architectural monument, and  an ornament to the country. It is due to the enterprise of the  late Mr. J. N. Tata, a Parsee merchant and manufacturer, and it  is to be hoped that its success will be sufficient to stimulate  similar enterprises elsewhere. It would be much better for the people  of India to coax tourists over here by offering them comforts,  luxuries and pleasures than to allow the few who do come, to go  away grumbling. The thousands who visit Cairo every winter are  attracted there by the hotels, for no city has better ones, and  no hotels give more for the money. Hence they pay big profits,  and are a source of prosperity to the city, as well as a pleasure  to the idle public.    The most interesting study in Bombay is the people, but there  are several excursions into the country around well worth making,  particularly those that take you to the cave temples of the Hindus,  which have been excavated with infinite labor and pains out of the  solid rock. With their primitive tools the people of ancient times  chiseled great caverns in the sides of rocky cliffs and hills and  fashioned them after the conventional designs of temples, with  columns, pillars, vaulted ceilings, platforms for their idols  and pulpits for their priests. The nearest of these wonderful  examples of stone cutting is on an island in the harbor of Bombay,  called Elephanta, because at one time a colossal stone elephant  stood on the slope near the landing place, but it was destroyed  by the Portuguese several centuries ago. The island rises about  600 feet above the water, its summit is crowned with a glorious  growth of forest, its sides are covered with dense jungles, and  the beach is skirted by mangrove swamps. You get there by a steam  launch provided by the managers of your hotel, or by Cook & Sons,  the tourist agents, whenever a sufficiently large party is willing  to pay them for their trouble. Or if you prefer a sail you can  hire one of the native boats with a peculiar rigging and usually  get a good breeze in the morning, although it is apt to die down  in the afternoon, and you have to take your chances of staying  out all night. The only landing place at Elephanta Island is a  wall of concrete which has been built out across the beach into  four or five feet of water, and you have to step gingerly lest  you slip on the slime. At the end of the wall a solid stairway  cut in the hillside leads up to the temple. It was formerly used  daily by thousands of worshipers, but in this degenerate age  nobody but tourists ever climb it. Every boat load that lands  is greeted by a group of bright-eyed children, who follow the  sahibs (gentlemen) and mem-sahibs (ladies) up the stairs, begging  for backsheesh and offering for sale curios beetles and other  insects of brilliant hues that abound on the island. Coolies  are waiting at the foot of the stairs with chairs fastened to  poles, in which they will carry a person up the steep stairway  to the temple for 10 cents."]]]
