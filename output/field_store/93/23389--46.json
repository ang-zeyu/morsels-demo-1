This was the beginning of the end. The Serbs, during an absence of  the Sultan in Asia, undertook an offensive, but were defeated by the Turks  near Adrianople in 1371, who captured Sofia in 1382. After this the Serbs  formed a huge southern Slav alliance, in which the Bulgarians refused to  join, but, after a temporary success against the Turks in 1387, they were  vanquished by them as the result of treachery at the famous battle of  Kosovo in 1389. Meanwhile the Turks occupied Nikopolis on the Danube in  1388 and destroyed the Bulgarian capital Tirnovo in 1393, exiling the  Patriarch Euthymus to Macedonia. Thus the state of Bulgaria passed into  the hands of the Turks, and its church into those of the Greeks. Many  Bulgars adopted Islam, and their descendants are the Pomaks or Bulgarian  Mohammedans of the present day. With the subjection of Rumania in 1394 and  the defeat of an improvised anti-Turkish crusade from western Europe under  Sigismund, King of Hungary, at Nikopolis in 1396 the Turkish conquest was  complete, though the battle of Varna was not fought till 1444, nor  Constantinople entered till 1453.        10    _The Turkish Dominion and the Emancipation,_ 1393-1878      From 1393 until 1877 Bulgaria may truthfully be said to have had no  history, but nevertheless it could scarcely have been called happy.  National life was completely paralysed, and what stood in those days for  national consciousness was obliterated. It is common knowledge, and most  people are now reasonable enough to admit, that the Turks have many  excellent qualities, religious fervour and military ardour amongst others;  it is also undeniable that from an aesthetic point of view too much cannot  be said in praise of Mohammedan civilization. Who does not prefer the  minarets of Stambul and Edirne[1] to the architecture of Budapest,  notoriously the ideal of Christian south-eastern Europe? On the other  hand, it cannot be contended that the Pax Ottomana brought prosperity or  happiness to those on whom it was imposed (unless indeed they submerged  their identity in the religion of their conquerors), or that its Influence  was either vivifying or generally popular.    [Footnote 1: The Turkish names for Constantinople and Adrianople.]    To the races they conquered the Turks offered two alternatives--serfdom or  Turkdom; those who could not bring themselves to accept either of these  had either to emigrate or take to brigandage and outlawry in the  mountains. The Turks literally overlaid the European nationalities of the  Balkan peninsula for five hundred years, and from their own point of view  and from that of military history this was undoubtedly a very splendid  achievement; it was more than the Greeks or Romans had ever done. From the  point of view of humanitarianism also it is beyond a doubt that much less  human blood was spilt in the Balkan peninsula during the five hundred  years of Turkish rule than during the five hundred years of Christian rule  which preceded them; indeed it would have been difficult to spill more. It  is also a pure illusion to think of the Turks as exceptionally brutal or  cruel; they are just as good-natured and good-humoured as anybody else; it  is only when their military or religious passions are aroused that they  become more reckless and ferocious than other people. It was not the Turks  who taught cruelty to the Christians of the Balkan peninsula; the latter  had nothing to learn in this respect.    In spite of all this, however, from the point of view of the Slavs of  Bulgaria and Serbia, Turkish rule was synonymous with suffocation. If the  Turks were all that their greatest admirers think them the history of the  Balkan peninsula in the nineteenth century would have been very different  from what it has been, namely, one perpetual series of anti-Turkish  revolts.    Of all the Balkan peoples the Bulgarians were the most completely crushed  and effaced. The Greeks by their ubiquity, their brains, and their money  were soon able to make the Turkish storm drive their own windmill; the  Rumanians were somewhat sheltered by the Danube and also by their distance  from Constantinople; the Serbs also were not so exposed to the full blast  of the Turkish wrath, and the inaccessibility of much of their country  afforded them some protection. Bulgaria was simply annihilated, and its  population, already far from homogeneous, was still further varied by  numerous Turkish and other Tartar colonies.    For the same reasons already mentioned Bulgaria was the last Balkan state  to emancipate itself; for these reasons also it is the least trammelled by  prejudices and by what are considered national predilections and racial  affinities, while its heterogeneous composition makes it vigorous and  enterprising. The treatment of the Christians by the Turks was by no means  always the same; generally speaking, it grew worse as the power of the  Sultan grew less. During the fifteenth century they were allowed to  practise their religion and all their vocations in comparative liberty and  peace. But from the sixteenth century onwards the control of the Sultan  declined, power became decentralized, the Ottoman Empire grew ever more  anarchic and the rule of the provincial governors more despotic.    But the Mohammedan conquerors were not the only enemies and oppressors of  the Bulgars. The role played by the Greeks in Bulgaria during the Turkish  dominion was almost as important as that of the Turks themselves. The  contempt of the Turks for the Christians, and especially for their  religion, was so great that they prudently left the management of it to  them, knowing that it would keep them occupied in mutual altercation. From  1393 till 1767 the Bulgarians were under the Greco-Bulgarian Patriarchate  of Okhrida, an organization in which all posts, from the highest to the  lowest, had to be bought from the Turkish administration at exorbitant and  ever-rising prices; the Phanariote Greeks (so called because they  originated in the Phanar quarter at Constantinople) were the only ones who  could afford those of the higher posts, with the result that the Church  was controlled from Constantinople. In 1767 the independent patriarchates  were abolished, and from that date the religious control of the Greeks was  as complete as the political control of the Turks. The Greeks did all they  could to obliterate the last traces of Bulgarian nationality which had  survived in the Church, and this explains a fact which must never be  forgotten, which had its origin in the remote past, but grew more  pronounced at this period, that the individual hatred of Greeks and  Bulgars of each other has always been far more intense than their  collective hatred of the Turks.    Ever since the marriage of the Tsar Ivan III with the niece of the last  Greek Emperor, in 1472, Russia had considered itself the trustee of the  eastern Christians, the defender of the Orthodox Church, and the direct  heir of the glory and prestige of Constantinople; it was not until the  eighteenth century, however, after the consolidation of the Russian state,  that the Balkan Christians were championed and the eventual possession of  Constantinople was seriously considered. Russian influence was first  asserted in Rumania after the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainardji, in 1774. It was  only the Napoleonic war in 1812 that prevented the Russians from extending  their territory south of the Danube, whither it already stretched. Serbia  was partially free by 1826, and Greece achieved complete independence in  1830, when the Russian troops, in order to coerce the Turks, occupied part  of Bulgaria and advanced as far as Adrianople. Bulgaria, being nearer to  and more easily repressed by Constantinople, had to wait, and tentative  revolts made about this time were put down with much bloodshed and were  followed by wholesale emigrations of Bulgars into Bessarabia and  importations of Tartars and Kurds into the vacated districts. The Crimean  War and the short-sighted championship of Turkey by the western European  powers checked considerably the development at which Russia aimed.  Moldavia and Wallachia were in 1856 withdrawn from the semi-protectorate  which Russia had long exercised over them, and in 1861 formed themselves  into the united state of Rumania. In 1866 a German prince, Charles of  Hohenzollern, came to rule over the country, the first sign of German  influence in the Near East; at this time Rumania still acknowledged the  supremacy of the Sultan.    During the first half of the nineteenth century there took place a  considerable intellectual renascence in Bulgaria, a movement fostered by  wealthy Bulgarian merchants of Bucarest and Odessa. In 1829 a history of  Bulgaria was published by a native of that country in Moscow; in 1835 the  first school was established in Bulgaria, and many others soon followed.  It must be remembered that not only was nothing known at that time about  Bulgaria and its inhabitants in other countries, but the Bulgars had  themselves to be taught who they were. The Bulgarian people in Bulgaria  consisted entirely of peasants; there was no Bulgarian upper or middle or  'intelligent' or professional class; those enlightened Bulgars who existed  were domiciled in other countries; the Church was in the hands of the  Greeks, who vied with the Turks in suppressing Bulgarian nationality.    The two committees of Odessa and Bucarest which promoted the enlightenment  and emancipation of Bulgaria were dissimilar in composition and in aim;  the members of the former were more intent on educational and religious  reform, and aimed at the gradual and peaceful regeneration of their  country by these means; the latter wished to effect the immediate  political emancipation of Bulgaria by violent and, if necessary, warlike  means.

I----\"    Here a terrific shriek from Migwan brought them all to their feet. She  had been poking about in the corner of the Kitchen, when something had  suddenly jumped out at her, unfolded itself like a fan and was whirling  around her head. \"It's a bat!\" cried Sahwah, and they all laughed  heartily at Migwan's fright. The bat wheeled around, blind in the  daylight, and went bumping against the girls, causing them to run in  alarm lest it should get entangled in their hair. It finally found its  way back to the dark corner of the Kitchen and hung itself up neatly the  way Migwan had found it and the dinner proceeded.    \"What kind of a bat was it?\" asked Gladys.    \"Must have been a _bacon bat_,\" said Sahwah, dodging the acorn that  Hinpoha threw at her for making a pun.    \"Tell us a new game to play, Nyoda,\" said Gladys, \"or Sahwah will go  right on making puns.\"    \"Here is one I thought of on the way down,\" answered Nyoda. \"Think of  all the things that you know are manufactured in Cleveland, or form an  important part of the shipping industry. Then we'll go around the  circle, naming them in alphabetical order. Each girl may have ten  seconds in which to think when her turn comes, and if she misses she is  out of the game. She may only come in again by supplying a word when  another has missed, before the next girl in the circle can think of  one.\"    \"And let the two that hold out the longest have the first ride in the  canoe,\" suggested Sahwah.    The game started. Nyoda had the first chance. \"Automobiles,\" she began.    \"Bricks,\" said Gladys.    \"Clothing,\" said Migwan.    \"Drugs,\" said Sahwah.    \"Engines,\" said Hinpoha.    \"Flour,\" said Mrs. Evans.    \"Gasoline,\" said Nakwisi.    \"Hardware,\" said Chapa.    \"Iron,\" said Medmangi.    Nyoda hesitated, fishing for a \"J.\" \"One, two, three, four, five, six,\"  began Sahwah.    \"Jewelry!\" cried Nyoda on the tenth count.    \"Knitted goods,\" continued Gladys.    \"Lamps,\" said Migwan.    \"Macaroni,\" said Sahwah.    \"That reminds me,\" said Mrs. Evans, \"I meant to order some macaroni  to-day and forgot it.\"    \"N,\" said Hinpoha, \"N,--why, Nothing!\" The girls laughed at the witty  application, but she was ruled out nevertheless.    \"Nails,\" said Mrs. Evans.    \"Oil,\" said Nakwisi.    \"Paint,\" said Chapa.    Medmangi sat down. Nyoda began to count. \"Quadrupeds!\" cried Medmangi  hastily.    \"Explain yourself,\" said Nyoda.    \"Tables and chairs,\" said Medmangi. The girls shouted in derision, but  Nyoda ruled the answer in, and the game proceeded.    \"Refrigerators,\" said Nyoda.    \"Salt,\" said Gladys.    \"Tents,\" said Migwan, with a reminiscent sigh.    \"Umbrellas,\" said Sahwah.    Mrs. Evans fell down on \"V.\" \"Varnish,\" said Chapa.    \"W\" was too much for Medmangi. \"Wire,\" said Nyoda.    \"X,\" said Sahwah, \"there is no such thing. Oh, yes, there is, too;  Xylophones, they're made here.\"    Gladys and Migwan met their Waterloo on \"Y.\" \"Yeast,\" said Nyoda.    \"Z,\" sent Chapa and Nakwisi to the dummy corner and it came back to  Sahwah. \"Zerolene,\" she said.    \"What's that?\" they all cried.    \"I don't know,\" she answered, \"but I saw it on one of the big oil tanks  as we passed.\"    Sahwah and Nyoda won the right to take the first paddle in the  _Keewaydin_. They carried the canoe on their heads, portage fashion,  around the dam, and launched it up above, where the confined waters had  spread out into a wide pond. \"Oh, what a joy to dip a paddle again!\"  sighed Sahwah blissfully, sending the _Keewaydin_ flying through the  water with long, vigorous strokes. \"I'd love to paddle all the way  home.\" She had completely forgotten that there was such a thing as  school and lessons in the world. She was the Daughter of the River, and  this was a joyous homecoming.    \"Time to go back and let the rest have a turn,\" said Nyoda. Reluctantly  Sahwah steered the canoe around and returned to the waiting group. Mrs.  Evans watched with interest as Gladys and Hinpoha pushed out from shore.  Could this be her once frail daughter, who had despised all strenuous  sports and hated water above all things, who was swinging her paddle so  lustily and steering the _Keewaydin_ so skilfully? What was this strange  Something that the Camp Fire had instilled into her? She caught her  breath with the beauty of it, as the girls glided along between the  radiant banks, the two paddles flashing in and out in perfect rhythm.  They were singing a favorite boating song, and their voices floated back  on the breeze:      \"Through the mystic haze of the autumn days    Like a phantom ghost I glide,    Where the big moose sees the crimson trees    Mirrored on the silver tide,    And the blood red sun when day is done    Sinks below the hill,    The night hawk swoops, the lily droops,    And all the world is still!\"    Sahwah lingered on the river after the others had gone in a body to try  to climb to the top of the rocky fireplace. She was all alone in the  _Keewaydin_, and sent it darting around like a water spider on the  surface of the stream. So absorbed was she in the joy of paddling that  she did not see a sign on a tree beside the river which warned people in  boats to go no further than that point, neither did she realize the  significance of the quicker progress which the _Keewaydin_ was making.  When she did realize that she was getting dangerously near the edge of  the dam, and attempted to turn back, she discovered to her horror that  it was impossible to turn back. The _Keewaydin_ was being swept  helplessly and irresistibly onward. Recent rains had swollen the stream  and the water was pouring over the dam. Sahwah screamed aloud when she  saw the peril in which she was. Nyoda and Mrs. Evans and the girls,  standing up on the rocks, turned and saw her. Help was out of the  question. Frozen to the spot they saw her rushing along to that descent  of waters. Gladys moaned and covered her face with her hands. Below the  falls the great rocks jutted out, jagged and bare. Any boat going over  would be dashed to pieces.    The _Keewaydin_ shot forward, gaining speed with every second. The roar  of the falls filled Sahwah's ears. Not ten feet from the brink a rock  jutted up a little above the surface, just enough to divide the current  into two streams. When the _Keewaydin_ reached this point it turned  sharply and was hurled into the current nearest the shore. On the bank  right at the brink of the falls stood a great willow tree, its long  branches drooping far out over the water. It was one chance in a million  and Sahwah saw it. As she passed under the tree she reached up and  caught hold of a branch, seized it firmly and jumped clear of the canoe,  which went over the falls almost under her feet. Then, swinging along by  her arms, she reached the shore and stood in safety. It had all happened  so quickly the girls could hardly comprehend it. Gladys, who had hidden  her eyes to shut out the dreadful sight, heard an incredulous shout from  the girls and looked down to see the _Keewaydin_ landing on the rocks  below, empty, and Sahwah standing on the bank.    \"How did you ever manage to do it?\" gasped Hinpoha, when they had  surrounded her with exclamations of joy and amazement. \"You're a heroine  again.\"    \"You're nothing of the sort,\" said Nyoda. \"It was sheer foolhardiness or  carelessness that got you into that scrape. A girl who doesn't know  enough to keep out of the current isn't to be trusted with a canoe, no  matter what a fine paddler she is. I certainly thought better of you  than that, Sahwah. I never used to have the slightest anxiety when you  were on the water, I had such a perfect trust in your common sense, but  now I can never feel quite sure of you again.\"    Sahwah hung her head in shame, for she felt the truth of Nyoda's words.  \"I think you can trust me after this,\" she said humbly. \"I have learned  my lesson.\" She was not likely to forget the horror of the moment when  she had heard the water roaring over the dam and thought her time had  come. Sahwah liked to be thought clever as well as daring, and it was  certainly far from clever to run blindly into danger as she had done.  She sank dejectedly down on the bank, feeling disgraced forever in the  eyes of the Winnebagos.    \"Girls,\" said Mrs. Evans, wishing to take their minds off the fright  they had received, \"do you know that we are not many miles from one of  the model dairy farms of the world? I could take you over in the car and  bring you back here in time to go home in the launch.\"    \"Let's do it, Nyoda,\" begged all the Winnebagos, and into the machine  they piled. When they were still far in the distance they could see the  high towers of the barns rising in the air. \"We're nearly there,\" said  Mrs. Evans; \"here is the beginning to the cement fence that runs all the  way around the four-thousand-acre farm.\" Mrs. Evans knew some of the  people in charge of the farm and they had no difficulty gaining  admittance. That visit to the Carter Farm was a long-remembered one. The  girls walked through the long stables exclaiming at everything they saw.    \"Why, there's an electric fan in each stall!\" gasped Migwan, \"and the  windows are screened!\"    \"Oo, look at the darling calf,\" gurgled Hinpoha, on her knees before one  of the stalls, caressing a ten-thousand-dollar baby.    \"It doesn't look a bit like its mother,\" observed Nyoda, comparing it  with the cow standing beside it.    \"That isn't its mother, that's its nurse,\" said the man who was showing  them around.    \"Its what?\" said Nyoda. Then the man explained that the milk from the  blooded cows was too valuable to be fed to calves, as it commanded a  high price on the market, and so a herd of common cows were kept to feed  the aristocratic babies. The lovely little creatures were as tame as  kittens and allowed"]]]
