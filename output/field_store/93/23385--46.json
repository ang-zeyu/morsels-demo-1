The change will do her good,  and if her conduct improves, I will keep her as long as you like. She is  young to mention in regard to marriage, but in another year she will be  as old as I was when I married, and it might be the makings of her if  she married early. At any rate she will be better away from Possum  Gully, now that she is growing into womanhood, or she may be in danger  of forming ties beneath her. She might do something good for herself up  here: not that I would ever be a matchmaker in the least degree, but  Gertie will soon be coming on, and Sybylla, being so very plain, will  need all the time she can get.    Your loving mother,    L. Bossier.      My mother gave me this letter to read, and, when I had finished perusing  it, asked me would I go. I replied coldly:    \"Yes. Paupers and beggars cannot be choosers, and grandmother might as  well keep me at Caddagat as at Possum Gully\"--for my grandmother  contributed greatly to the support of our family.    As regards scenery, the one bit of beauty Possum Gully possessed was its  wattles. Bowers of grown and scrubs of young ones adorned the hills and  gullies in close proximity to the house, while groves of different  species graced the flats. Being Sunday, on this afternoon I was at  liberty for a few hours; and on receiving the intelligence contained in  the letter, I walked out of the house over a low hill at the back into a  gully, where I threw myself at the foot of a wattle in a favourite  clump, and gave way to my thoughts.    So mother had been telling my grandmother of my faults--my grandmother  whom I loved so dearly. Mother might have had enough honour and motherly  protection to have kept the tale of my sins to herself. Though this  intelligence angered, it did not surprise me, being accustomed to mother  telling every neighbour what a great trial I was to her--how  discontented I was, and what little interest I took in my work. It was  the last part of the letter which finished up my feelings. Oh heavens!  Surely if my mother understood the wild pain, the days and hours of  agony pure and complete I have suffered on account of my appearance, she  would never have shown me that letter.    I was to be given more time on account of being ugly--I was not a  valuable article in the marriage market, sweet thought! My grandmother  is one of the good old school, who believed that a girl's only proper  sphere in life was marriage; so, knowing her sentiments, her purpose to  get me married neither surprised nor annoyed me. But I was plain. Ah,  bosh! Oh! Ah! I cannot express what kind of a feeling that fact gave me.  It sank into my heart and cut like a cruel jagged knife--not because it  would be a drawback to me in the marriage line, for I had an antipathy  to the very thought of marriage. Marriage to me appeared the most  horribly tied-down and unfair-to-women existence going. It would be from  fair to middling if there was love; but I laughed at the idea of love,  and determined never, never, never to marry.    The other side of the letter--the part which gave me joy--was the  prospect of going to Caddagat.    Caddagat, the place where I was born! Caddagat, whereat, enfolded in  grandmotherly love and the petting which accrued therefrom, I spent some  of my few sweet childish days. Caddagat, the place my heart fondly  enshrines as home. Caddagat, draped by nature in a dream of beauty.  Caddagat, Caddagat! Caddagat for me, Caddagat for ever! I say.    Too engrossed with my thoughts to feel the cold of the dull winter day,  I remained in my position against the wattle-tree until Gertie came to  inform me that tea was ready.    \"You know, Sybylla, it was your turn to get the tea ready; but I set the  table to save you from getting into a row. Mother was looking for you,  and said she supposed you were in one of your tantrums again.\"    Pretty little peacemaker! She often did things like that for me.    \"Very well, Gertie, thank you. I will set it two evenings running to  make up for it--if I'm here.\"    \"If you are here! What do you mean?\"    \"I am going away,\" I replied, watching her narrowly to see if she cared,  for I was very hungry for love.    \"Going to run away becauses mother is always scolding you?\"    \"No, you little silly! I'm going up to Caddagat to live with grannie.\"    \"Always?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Honour bright?\"    \"Yes; really and truly and honour bright.\"    \"Won't you ever come back again?\"    \"I don't know about _never_ coming back again; but I'm going up for  always, as far as a person can lay out ahead of her. Do you care?\"    Yes she cared. The childish mouth quivered, the pretty blue-eyed face  fell, the ready tears flowed fast. I noticed every detail with savage  comfort. It was more than I deserved, for, though I loved her  passionately, I had ever been too much wrapped in self to have been very  kind and lovable to her.    \"Who will tell me stories now?\"    It was a habit of mine to relate stories to her out of my own fertile  imagination. In return for this she kept secret the fact that I sat up  and wrote when I should have been in bed. I was obliged to take some  means of inducing her to keep silence, as she--even Gertie, who firmly  believed in me--on waking once or twice at unearthly hours and  discovering me in pursuit of my nightly task, had been so alarmed for my  sanity that I had the greatest work to prevent her from yelling to  father and mother on the spot. But I bound her to secrecy, and took a  strange delight in bringing to her face with my stories the laughter,  the wide-eyed wonder, or the tears--just as my humour dictated.    \"You'll easily get someone else to tell you stories.\"    \"Not like yours. And who will take my part when Horace bullies me?\"    I pressed her to me.    \"Gertie, Gertie, promise me you will love me a little always, and never,  never forget me. Promise me.\"    And with a weakly glint of winter sunshine turning her hair to gold, and  with her head on my shoulder, Gertie promised--promised with the soluble  promise of a butterfly-natured child.      SELF-ANALYSIS    N.B.--This is dull and egotistical. Better skip it. That's my advice--S.  P. M.      As a tiny child I was filled with dreams of the great things I was to do  when grown up. My ambition was as boundless as the mighty bush in which  I have always lived. As I grew it dawned upon me that I was a girl--the  makings of a woman! Only a girl--merely this and nothing more. It came  home to me as a great blow that it was only men who could take the world  by its ears and conquer their fate, while women, metaphorically  speaking, were forced to sit with tied hands and patiently suffer as the  waves of fate tossed them hither and thither, battering and bruising  without mercy. Familiarity made me used to this yoke; I recovered from  the disappointment of being a girl, and was reconciled to that part of  my fate. In fact, I found that being a girl was quite pleasant until a  hideous truth dawned upon me--I was ugly! That truth has embittered my  whole existence. It gives me days and nights of agony. It is a sensitive  sore that will never heal, a grim hobgoblin that nought can scare away.  In conjunction with this brand of hell I developed a reputation of  cleverness. Worse and worse! Girls! girls! Those of you who have hearts,  and therefore a wish for happiness, homes, and husbands by and by, never  develop a reputation of being clever. It will put you out of the  matrimonial running as effectually as though it had been circulated that  you had leprosy. So, if you feel that you are afflicted with more than  ordinary intelligence, and especially if you are plain with it, hide  your brains, cramp your mind, study to appear unintellectual--it is your  only chance. Provided a woman is beautiful allowance will be made for  all her shortcomings. She can be unchaste, vapid, untruthful, flippant,  heartless, and even clever; so long as she is fair to see men will stand  by her, and as men, in this world, are \"the dog on top\", they are the  power to truckle to. A plain woman will have nothing forgiven her. Her  fate is such that the parents of uncomely female infants should be  compelled to put them to death at their birth.    The next unpleasant discovery I made in regard to myself was that I was  woefully out of my sphere. I studied the girls of my age around me, and  compared myself with them. We had been reared side by side. They had had  equal advantages; some, indeed, had had greater. We all moved in the one  little, dull world, but they were not only in their world, they were of  it; I was not. Their daily tasks and their little pleasures provided  sufficient oil for the lamp of their existence--mine demanded more than  Possum Gully could supply. They were totally ignorant of the outside  world. Patti, Melba, Irving, Terry, Kipling, Caine, Corelli, and even  the name of Gladstone, were only names to them. Whether they were  islands or racehorses they knew not and cared not. With me it was  different. Where I obtained my information, unless it was born in me, I  do not know. We took none but the local paper regularly, I saw few  books, had the pleasure of conversing with an educated person from the  higher walks of life about once in a twelvemonth, yet I knew of every  celebrity in literature, art, music, and drama; their world was my  world, and in fancy I lived with them. My parents discouraged me in that  species of foolishness. They had been fond of literature and the higher  arts, but now, having no use for them, had lost interest therein.    I was discontented and restless, and longed unendurably to be out in the  stream of life. \"Action! Action! Give me action!\" was my cry. My mother  did her best with me according to her lights. She energetically preached  at me. All the old saws and homilies were brought into requisition, but  without avail. It was like using common nostrums on a disease which"]]]
