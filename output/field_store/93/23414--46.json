[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#8)"],[1,"morning while we were sitting on the porch of Mr. Caldwell's  house preparing some bird skins, there came a sharp crackle of rifle fire  and then a roar of shots. Bullets began to whistle over us and we could see  puffs of smoke as the deep bang of a black powder gun punctuated the  vicious snapping of the high-power rifles. The firing gradually ceased  after half an hour and we decided to go down to the city to see what had  happened, for, as no Northern troops had appeared, the cause of the  fighting was a mystery.    We went first to the mission hospital which lay across a deep ravine and  only a few yards from the quarters of the soldiers. At the door of the  hospital compound lay a bloody rag, and we found Dr. Trimble in the  operating room examining a wounded man who had just been brought in. The  fellow had been shot in the abdomen with a 45-caliber lead ball that had  gone entirely through him, emerging about three inches to the right of his  spine.    From the doctor we got the first real news of the puzzling situation. It  appeared that all the men who had arrived Sunday morning from Yuchi to join  the Yen-ping rebels were in reality brigands and, to save their own lives,  the Hunan soldiers quartered in the city had played a clever trick. They  had pretended to join the rebels but at a given signal had turned upon  them, killing or capturing almost every one. Although their sympathies were  really with the South, the Hunan men knew that the rebels in Yen-ping could  not hold the city against the Northern soldiers from Foochow and, by  crushing the rebellion themselves, they hoped to avert a bigger fight.    As we could not help the doctor he suggested that we might be of some  assistance to the wounded in the city, and with rude crosses of red cloth  pinned to our white shirt sleeves we left the hospital, accompanied by four  Chinese attendants bearing a stretcher. In the compound we met a chair in  which was lying an old man groaning loudly and dripping with blood. Beside  him were his wife and several boys. The poor woman was crying quietly and,  between her sobs, was offering the wounded man mustard pickles from a small  dish in her hand! Poor things, they have so little to eat that they believe  food will cure all ills!    The bearers set the chair down as we appeared and lifted the filthy rag  which covered a gaping wound in the man's shoulder, over which had been  plastered a great mass of cow dung. Just think of the infection, but it was  the only remedy they knew!    We took the man upstairs where Dr. Trimble was preparing to operate on the  fellow who had been shot in the abdomen. The doctor was working steadily  and quietly, making every move count and inspiring his native hospital  staff with his own coolness; the way this young missionary handled his  cases made us glad that he was an American.    On the way down the hill several soldiers passed us, each carrying four or  five rifles and slung about with cartridge belts--plunder stripped from the  men who had been killed. A few hundred yards farther on we found two  brigands lying dead in a narrow street. The nearest one had fallen on his  face and, as we turned him over, we saw that half his head had been blown  away; the other was staring upward with wide open eyes on which the flies  already were settling in swarms.    There was little use in wasting time over these men who long ago had passed  beyond need of our help, and we went on rapidly down the alley to the main  thoroughfare. Guided by a small boy, we hurried over the rough stones for  fifteen minutes, and suddenly came to a man lying at the side of the  street, his head propped on a wooden block. An umbrella once had partly  covered him but had fallen away, leaving him unprotected in the broiling  sun. His face and a terrible wound in his head were a solid mass of flies,  and thousands of insects were crawling over the blood clots on the stones  beside him. At first we thought he was dead but soon saw his abdomen move  and realized that he was breathing. It did not seem possible that a human  being could live under such conditions; and yet the bystanders told us that  he had been lying there for thirty hours--he had been shot early the  previous morning and it was now three o'clock of the next afternoon.    The man was a poor water-carrier who lived with his wife in the most utter  poverty. He had been peering over the city wall when the firing began  Sunday morning and was one of the first innocent bystanders to pay the  penalty of his curiosity. I asked why he had not been taken to the  hospital, and the answer was that his wife was too poor to hire anyone to  carry him and he had no friends. So there he lay in the burning sun, gazed  at by hundreds of passers-by, without one hand being lifted to help him.    Our hospital attendants brushed away the flies, placed him in the stretcher  and started up the long hill, followed by the haggard, weeping wife and a  curious crowd. On every hand were questions: \"Why are these men taking him  away?\" \"What are they going to do with him?\" But several educated natives  who understood said, \"_Ing-ai-gidaiie_\" (A work of love). They got right  there a lesson in Christianity which they will not soon forget. It is  seldom that Chinese try to help an injured man, for ever present in their  minds is the possibility that he may die and that they will be responsible  for his burial expenses.    We left the stretcher bearers at the corner of the main street with orders  to return as soon as they had deposited the man in the hospital and, under  the guidance of a boy, hurried toward the east gate where it was said seven  or eight men had been shot. Our guide took us first to a brigand who had  been wounded and left to die beside the gutter. The corpse was a horrible  sight and with a feeling of deathly nausea we made a hurried examination  and walked to the gate at the end of the street.    A dozen soldiers were on guard. We learned from the officer that there were  no wounded in the pile of dead just beyond the entrance, so we turned  toward the river bank and rapidly patrolled the alleys leading to the  _tao-tai's yamen_ (official residence) where the firing had been heaviest.  The _yamen_ was crowded with soldiers, and we were informed that the dead  had all been removed and that there were no wounded--a grim statement which  told its own story.    The _yamen_ is but a short distance from the hospital so we climbed the  hill to the compound. The sun was simply blazing and I realized then what  the wounded men must have suffered lying in the heat without shelter. We  returned to the house and were resting on the upper porch when suddenly,  far down the river, we saw the glint of rifle barrels in the sunlight, and  with field glasses made out a long line of khaki-clad men winding along the  shore trail. At the same time two huge boats filled with soldiers came into  view heading for the water gate of the city. These were undoubtedly the  Northern troops from Foochow who were expected Monday night.    Even as we looked there came a sudden roar of musketry and a cloud of smoke  drifted up from the barracks right below us--then a rattling fusillade of  shots. We could see soldiers running along the walls firing at men below  and often in our direction. Bullets hummed in the air like angry bees and  we rushed for cover, but in a few moments the firing ceased as suddenly as  it began.    We were at a loss to know what it all meant and why the troops were firing  upon the Northern soldiers whom they wished to placate. It was still a  mystery when we sat down to dinner at half past seven, but a few minutes  later Mr. Bankhardt rushed in saying that he had just received a note from  the _tao-tai_. The mandarin's personal servant had brought word that the  Northern soldiers, who had just entered the city, were going to kill him  and he begged the missionaries for assistance. Bankhardt also told us of  the latest developments in the situation. It seems that the city soldiers  supposed the Northern troops to be brigands and had fired upon them and  killed several before they discovered their mistake. A very delicate  situation had thus been precipitated, for the Northern commander believed  that it was treachery and intended to attack the barracks in the morning  and kill every man whom he found with a rifle, as well as all the city  officials.    The story of the way in which the missionaries acted as peacemakers, saved  the _tao-tai_, and prevented the slaughter which surely would have taken  place in the morning, is too long to be told here, for it was accomplished  only after hours of the talk and \"face saving\" so dear to the heart of the  Oriental. Suffice it to say that through the exercise of great tact and a  thorough understanding of the Chinese character they were able to settle  the matter without bloodshed.    The following day twenty brigands were given a so-called trial, marched off  to the west gate, beheaded amid great enthusiasm, and the incident was  closed. In the afternoon a messenger called and delivered to each of us an  official letter from the commander of the Northern troops thanking us for  the part we had played in averting trouble and bringing the matter to a  peaceful end.    An interesting sidelight on the affair was received a few days later. A  young man, a Christian, who was born in the same town from which a number  of the brigands had come, went to his house on Monday night after the fight  and found seven of the robbers concealed in his bedroom. He was terrified  because if they were discovered he and all his family would be killed for  aiding the bandits. He told them they must leave at once, but they pleaded  with him to let them stay for they knew there were soldiers at every corner  and that it would be impossible to get away.    While he was imploring them to go, a knock sounded at the door. He pushed  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#8)"],[1,"were not told  about heaven; they were told to honor their masters and mistresses and  of the damnation which awaited them for disobedience.    After slavery the Hart family moved to Georgia where Della grew into  womanhood and at an early age married Caleb Bess by whom she had two  children. After the death of Bess, about fifteen years ago, \"Aunt Bess\"  moved to Fort Pierce, Florida. While there she married Lonny Hilyard  who brought her to Titusville where she now resides, a relic of bygone  days. (3)      Taylor Gilbert    Taylor Gilbert was born in Shellman, Georgia, 91 years ago, of a colored  mother and a white father, \"which is why I am so white\", he adds. He has  never been known to have passed as white, however, in spite of the fact  that he could do so without detection. David Ferguson bought Jacob  Gilbert from Dr. Gilbert as a husband for Emily, Taylor's mother. Emily  had nine children, two by a white man, Frances and Taylor, and seven by  Jacob, only three of whom Gilbert remembers--Gettie, Rena, and Annis.  Two of these children were sent to school while the others were obliged  to work on the plantation. Emily, the mother, was the cook and washwoman  while Jacob was the Butler.    Gilbert, a good sized lad when slavery was at its height, recalls  vividly the cruel lashings and other punishments meted out to those who  disobeyed their master or attempted to run away. It was the custom of  slaves who wished to go from one plantation to another to carry passes  in case they were stopped as suspected runaways. Frequently slaves would  visit without benefit of passes, and as result they suffered severe  torturing. Often the sons of the slaves' owners would go \"nigger  hunting\" and nothing--not even murder was too horrible for them to do to  slaves caught without passes. They justified their fiendish acts by  saying the \"nigger tried to run away when told to stop.\"    Gilbert cannot remember when he came to Florida, but he claims that it  was many years ago. Like the majority of Negroes after slavery, he  became a farmer which occupation he still pursues. He married once but  \"my wife got to messin' around with another man so I sent her home to  her mother.\" He can be found in Miami, Florida, where he may be seen  daily hobbling around on his cane.

FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    James Johnson, Field Worker  Monticello, Florida  December 15, 1936    PATIENCE CAMPBELL      Patience Campbell, blind for 26 years, was-born in Jackson County, near  Marianna, Florida about 1883[TR: incorrect date?], on a farm of George  Bullock. Her mother Tempy, belonged to Bullock, while her father Arnold  Merritt, belonged to Edward Merritt, a large plantation owner. According  to Patience, her mother's owner was very kind, her father's very cruel.  Bullock had very few slaves, but Merritt had a great many of them, not a  few of whom he sold at the slave markets.    Patience spent most of her time playing in the sand when she was a  child, while her parents toiled in the fields for their respective  owners. Her grandparents on her mother's side belonged to Bullock, but  of her father's people she knew nothing as \"they didn't come to this  country.\" When asked where they lived, she replied \"in South Carolina.\"    Since she lived with her mother, Patience fared much better than had she  lived with her father. Her main foods included meats, greens, rice, corn  bread which was replaced by biscuits on Sunday morning. Coffee was made  from parched corn or meal and was the chief drink. The food was cooked  in large iron pots and pans in an open fireplace and seasoned with salt  obtained by evaporating sea water.    Water for all purposes was drawn from a well. In order to get soap to  wash with, the cook would save all the grease left from the cooking. Lye  was obtained by mixing oak ashes with water and allowing them to decay;  Tubs were made from large barrels.    When she was about seven or eight, Patience assisted other children  about her age and older in picking out cotton seeds from the picked  cotton. After the cotton was weighed on improved scales, it was bound in  bags made of hemp.    Spinning and weaving were taught Patience when she was about ten.  Although the cloth and thread were dyed various colors, she knows only  how blue was obtained by allowing the indigo plant to rot in water and  straining the result.    Patience's father was not only a capable field worker but also a  finished shoemaker. After tanning and curing his hides by placing them  in water with oak bark for several days and then exposing them to the  sun to dry, he would cut out the uppers and the soles after measuring  the foot to be shod. There would be an inside sole as well as an outside  sole tacked together by means of small tacks made of maple wood. Sewing  was done on the shoes by means of flax thread.    Patience remembers saving the feathers from all the fowl to make feather  beds. She doesn't remember when women stopped wearing hoops in their  skirts nor when bed springs replaced bed ropes. She does remember,  however, that these things were used.    She saw her first windmill about 36 years ago, ten years before she went  blind. She remembers seeing buggies during slavery time, little light  carriages, some with two wheels and some with four. She never heard of  any money called \"shin-plasters,\" and she became money-conscious during  the war when Confederate currency was introduced. When the slaves were  sick, they were given castor oil, turpentine and medicines made from  various roots and herbs.    Patience's master joined the confederacy, but her father's master did  not. [Although Negroes could enlist in the Southern army if they  desired,] none of them wished to do so but preferred to join northern  forces and fight for the thing they desired most, freedom. When freedom  was no longer a dream, but a reality, the Merritts started life on their  own as farmers. Twelve-year old Patience entered one of the schools  established by the Freedmen's Bureau. She recalls the gradual growth of  Negro settlements, the churches and the rise and fall of the Negroes  politically.      REFERENCE    1.

Austin, Field Worker  Jacksonville, Florida  November 20, 1936    FLORIDA CLAYTON      The life of Florida Clayton is interesting in that it illustrates the  miscegenation prevalent during the days of slavery. Interesting also is  the fact that Florida was not a slave even though she was a product  of those turbulent days. Many years before her birth--March 1,  1854--Florida's great grandfather, a white man, came to Tallahassee,  Florida from Washington, District of Columbia, with his children whom he  had by his Negro slave. On coming to Florida, he set all of his children  free except one boy, Amos, who was sold to a Major Ward. For what reason  this was done, no one knew. Florida, named for the state in which she  was born, was one of seven children born to Charlotte Morris (colored)  whose father was a white man and David Clayton (white).    Florida, in a retrogressive mood, can recall the \"nigger hunters\" and  \"nigger stealers\" of her childhood days. Mr. Nimrod and Mr. Shehee, both  white, specialized in catching runaway slaves with their trained  bloodhounds. Her parents always warned her and her brothers and sisters  to go in someone's yard whenever they saw these men with their dogs lest  the ferocious animals tear them to pieces. In regards to the \"nigger  stealers,\" Florida tells of a covered wagon which used to come to  Tallahassee at regular intervals and camp in some secluded spot. The  children, attracted by the old wagon, would be eager to go near it, but  they were always told that \"Dry Head and Bloody Bones,\" a ghost who  didn't like children, was in that wagon. It was not until later years  that Florida and the other children learned that the driver of the wagon  was a \"nigger stealer\" who stole children and took them to Georgia to  sell at the slave markets.    When she was 11 years old, Florida saw the surrender of Tallahassee to  the Yankees. Three years later she came to Jacksonville to live with her  sister. She married but is now divorced after 12 years of marriage.    Three years ago she entered the Old Folks Home at 1627 Franklin Street  to live.      1.

Muse, Field Worker  Jacksonville, Florida  December 3, 1936    \"FATHER\" CHARLES COATES      \"Father\" Charles Coates, as he is called by all who know him, was born a  slave, 108 years ago at Richmond, Virginia, on the plantation of a man  named L'Angle. His early boyhood days was spent on the L'Angle place  filled with duties such as minding hogs, cows, bringing in wood and such  light work. His wearing apparel consisted of one garment, a shirt made  to reach below the knees and with three-quarter sleeves. He wore no  shoes until he was a man past 20 years of age.    The single garment was worn summer and winter alike and the change in  the weather did not cause an extra amount of clothes to be furnished for  the slaves. They were required to move about so fast at work that the  heat from the body was sufficient to keep them warm.    When Charles was still a young man Mr. L'Angle sold him on time payment  to W.B. Hall; who several years before the Civil War moved from Richmond  to Washington County, Georgia, carrying 135 grown slaves and many  children. Mr. Hall made Charles his carriage"]]]
