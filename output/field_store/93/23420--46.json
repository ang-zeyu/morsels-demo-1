[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],[0,"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#8)"],[1,"Gospel--I believe that    the realisation of Christian teaching is the end of the State; I    do not believe that we shall more nearly approach this end by the    help of the Jews.... If we withdraw this foundation, we retain in    a State nothing but an accidental aggregate of rights, a kind of    bulwark against the war of all against all, which ancient    philosophy has assumed. Therefore, gentlemen, do not let us spoil    the people of their Christianity; do not let us take from them    the belief that our legislation is drawn from the well of    Christianity, and that the State aims at the realisation of    Christianity even if it does not attain its end.\"    We can well understand how delighted Herr von Thadden was with his  pupil. \"With Bismarck I naturally will not attempt to measure myself,\"  he writes; \"in the last debates he has again said many admirable  things\"; and in another letter, \"I am quite enthusiastic for Otto  Bismarck.\" It was more important that the King felt as if these words  had been spoken out of his own heart.    Among his opponents, too, he had made his mark; they were never tired of  repeating well-worn jests about the medieval opinions which he had  sucked in with his mother's milk.    At the close of the session, he returned to Pomerania with fresh  laurels; he was now looked upon as the rising hope of the stern and  unbending Tories. His marriage took place in August, and the young Hans  Kleist, a cousin of the bride, as he proposed the bridegroom's health,  foretold that in their friend had arisen a new Otto of Saxony who would  do for his country all that his namesake had done eight hundred years  before. Careless words spoken half in jest, which thirty years later  Kleist, then Over-President of the province, recalled when he proposed  the bridegroom's health at the marriage of Bismarck's eldest daughter.  The forecast had been more than fulfilled, but fulfilled at the cost of  many an early friendship; and all the glory of later years could never  quite repay the happy confidence and intimacy of those younger days.    Followed by the good wishes of all their friends, Bismarck and his young  wife started on their wedding tour, which took them through Austria to  Italy. At Venice he came across the King of Prussia, who took the  opportunity to have more than one conversation with the man who had  distinguished himself in the States General. At the beginning of the  winter they returned to Schoenhausen to settle down to a quiet country  life. Fate was to will it otherwise. The storm which had long been  gathering burst over Europe. Bismarck was carried away by it; from  henceforth his life was entirely devoted to public duties, and we can  count by months the time he was able to spend with his wife at the old  family house; more than forty years were to pass before he was able  again to enjoy the leisure of his early years.    The revolution which at the end of February broke out in Paris quickly  spread to Germany; the ground was prepared and the news quickly came to  him, first of disorder in South Germany, then of the fall of the  Ministry in Dresden and Munich; after a few days it was told that a  revolution had taken place in Vienna itself. The rising in Austria was  the signal for Berlin, and on the 18th of March the revolution broke out  there also. The King had promised to grant a Constitution; a fierce  fight had taken place in the streets of the city between the soldiers  and the people; the King had surrendered to the mob, and had ordered the  troops to withdraw from the city. He was himself almost a prisoner in  his castle protected only by a civilian National Guard. He was exposed  to the insults of the crowd; his brother had had to leave the city and  the country. It is impossible to describe the enthusiasm and wild  delight with which the people of Germany heard of these events. Now the  press was free, now they also were going to be free and great and  strong. All the resistance of authority was overthrown; nothing, it  seemed, stood between them and the attainment of their ideal of a united  and free Germany. They had achieved a revolution; they had become a  political people; they had shewn themselves the equals of England and of  France. They had liberty, and they would soon have a Constitution.  Bismarck did not share this feeling; he saw only that the monarchy which  he respected, and the King whom, with all his faults, he loved and  honoured, were humiliated and disgraced. This was worse than Jena. A  defeat on the field of battle can be avenged; here the enemies were his  own countrymen; it was Prussian subjects who had made the King the  laughing-stock of Europe. Only a few months ago he had pleaded that they  should not lose that confidence between King and people which was the  finest tradition of the Prussian State; could this confidence ever be  restored when the blood of so many soldiers and citizens had been shed?  He felt as though someone had struck him in the face, for his country's  dishonour was to him as his own; he became ill with gall and anger. He  had only two thoughts: first to restore to the King courage and  confidence, and then--revenge on the men who had done this thing. He at  least was not going to play with the revolution. He at once sat down and  wrote to the King a letter full of ardent expressions of loyalty and  affection, that he might know there still were men on whom he could  rely. It is said that for months after, through all this terrible year,  the King kept it open by him on his writing-table. Then he hurried to  Berlin, if necessary to defend him with the sword. This was not  necessary, but the situation was almost worse than he feared; the King  was safe, but he was safe because he had surrendered to the revolution;  he had proclaimed the fatal words that _Prussia was to be dissolved in  Germany_.    At Potsdam Bismarck found his old friends of the Guard and the Court;  they were all in silent despair. What could they do to save the monarchy  when the King himself had deserted their cause? Some there were who even  talked of seeking help from the Czar of Russia, who had offered to come  to the help of the monarchy in Prussia and place himself at the head of  the Prussian army, even if necessary against their own King. There was  already a Liberal Ministry under Count Arnim, Bismarck's old chief at  Aachen; the Prussian troops were being sent to support the people of  Schleswig-Holstein in their rebellion against the Danes; the Ministers  favoured the aspirations of Poland for self-government; in Prussia there  was to be a Constituent Assembly and a new Constitution drawn up by it.  Bismarck did what he could; he went down to Schoenhausen and began to  collect signatures for an address of loyalty to the King; he wished to  instil into him confidence by appealing to the loyalty of the country  against the radicalism of the town. Then he hurried back to Berlin for  the meeting of the Estates General, which had been hastily summoned to  prepare for the new elections. An address was proposed thanking the King  for the concessions he had made; Bismarck opposed it, but he stood  almost alone.      \"I have not changed my opinion,\" he said, \"in the last six    months; the past is buried, and I regret more bitterly than any    of you that no human power can reawaken it, now that the Crown    itself has cast the earth on its coffin.\"    Two men alone voted against the address--Bismarck and Herr von Thadden.  \"It is easy to get fame nowadays,\" said the latter; \"a little courage is  all one requires.\"    Courage it did require; Berlin was terrorised; the new National Guard  was unable to maintain order; men scarcely dared to appear in the  streets in the ordinary dress of a gentleman. The city was full of  Polish insurgents, many of whom had only just been released from prison.  When the National Assembly came together, it became the organ of the  extreme Republican party; all the more moderate men and more  distinguished had preferred to be elected for that general German  Assembly which at the same time was sitting at Frankfort to create a new  Constitution for the whole Confederation. How quickly had the balance of  parties altered: Vincke, until a few months ago the leader of the  Liberals, found himself at Frankfort regarded as an extreme  Conservative; and Frankfort was moderate compared to Berlin. At this  time an ordinary English Radical would have been looked upon in Germany  as almost reactionary. Bismarck did not seek election for either of the  Assemblies; he felt that he could do no good by taking part in the  deliberations of a Parliament, the very meeting of which seemed to him  an offence against the laws and welfare of the State. He would indeed  have had no logical position; both Parliaments were Constituent  Assemblies; it was the duty of the one to build up a new Germany, of the  other a new Prussia; their avowed object was the regeneration of their  country. Bismarck did not believe that Prussia wanted regenerating; he  held that the roots for the future greatness of the State must be found  in the past. What happened to Germany he did not much care; all he saw  was that every proposal for the regeneration of Germany implied either a  dissolution of Prussia, or the subjection of the Prussian King to the  orders of an alien Parliament.    During the summer he did what he could; he contributed articles to the  newspapers attacking the Polish policy of the Government, and defending  the landlords and country gentry against the attacks made on them. As  the months went by, as the anarchy in Berlin increased, and the violence  of the Assembly as well as the helplessness of the Government became  more manifest, he and some of his friends determined to make their  voices heard in a more organised way.

Fig. 1 is a circle. Fig. 2 is a circle which contains an  ellipse, tangent to the circle at Q and P. Line segments from M (on the  circle) and N (on the ellipse) meet at point A.]    FIG. 1.--In Ptolemy's excentric theory, A may be taken to represent the  earth, C the centre of a planet's orbit, and E the equant, P (perigee)  and Q (apogee) being the apses of the orbit. Ptolemy's idea was that  uniform motion in a circle must be provided, and since the motion was  not uniform about the earth, A could not coincide with C; and since the  motion still failed to be uniform about A or C, some point E must be  found about which the motion should be uniform.    FIG. 2.--This is not drawn to scale, but is intended to illustrate  Kepler's modification of Ptolemy's excentric. Kepler found velocities at  P and Q proportional not to AP and AQ but to AQ and AP, or to EP and EQ  if EC = CA (bisection of the excentricity). The velocity at M was wrong,  and AM appeared too great. Kepler's first ellipse had M moved too near  C. The distance AC is much exaggerated in the figure, as also is MN.  AN = CP, the radius of the circle. MN should be .00429 of the radius,  and MC/NC should be 1.00429. The velocity at N appeared to be  proportional to EN ( = AN). Kepler concluded that Mars moved round PNQ,  so that the area described about A (the sun) was equal in equal times, A  being the focus of the ellipse PNQ. The angular velocity is not quite  constant about E, the equant or empty focus, but the difference could  hardly have been detected in Kepler's time.    Kepler's improved determination of the earth's orbit was obtained by  plotting the different positions of the earth corresponding to  successive rotations of Mars, i.e. intervals of 687 days. At each of  these the date of the year would give the angle MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth),  and Tycho's observation the angle MES. So the triangle could be solved  except for scale, and the ratio of SE to SM would give the distance of  Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed  position of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE,  showing the earth's inequality. Measuring from a fixed position of the  earth, it would give similarly a series of positions of Mars, which,  though lying not far from the circle whose diameter was the axis of  Mars' orbit, joining perihelion and aphelion, always fell inside the  circle except at those two points. It was a long time before it dawned  upon Kepler that the simplest figure falling within the circle except at  the two extremities of the diameter, was an ellipse, and it is not clear  why his first attempt with an ellipse should have been just as much too  narrow as the circle was too wide. The fact remains that he recognised  suddenly that halving this error was tantamount to reducing the circle  to the ellipse whose eccentricity was that of the old theory, i.e. that  in which the sun would be in one focus and the equant in the other.    Having now fitted the ends of both major and minor axes of the ellipse,  he leaped to the conclusion that the orbit would fit everywhere.    The practical effect of his clearing of the \"second inequality\" was to  refer the orbit of Mars directly to the sun, and he found that the area  between successive distances of Mars from the sun (instead of the sum of  the distances) was strictly proportional to the time taken, in short,  equal areas were described in equal times (2nd Law) when referred to the  sun in the focus of the ellipse (1st Law).    He announced that (1) The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in  one focus; and (2) The straight line joining the planet to the sun  sweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time. These are  Kepler's first and second Laws though not discovered in that order, and  it was at once clear that Ptolemy's \"bisection of the excentricity\"  simply amounted to the fact that the centre of an ellipse bisects the  distance between the foci, the sun being in one focus and the angular  velocity being uniform about the empty focus. For so many centuries had  the fetish of circular motion postponed discovery. It was natural that  Kepler should assume that his laws would apply equally to all the  planets, but the proof of this, as well as the reason underlying the  laws, was only given by Newton, who approached the subject from a  totally different standpoint.    This commentary on Mars was published in 1609, the year of the invention  of the telescope, and Kepler petitioned the Emperor for further funds to  enable him to complete the study of the other planets, but once more  there was delay; in 1612 Rudolph died, and his brother Matthias who  succeeded him, cared very little for astronomy or even astrology, though  Kepler was reappointed to his post of Imperial Mathematician. He left  Prague to take up a permanent professorship at the University of Linz.  His own account of the circumstances is gloomy enough. He says, \"In the  first place I could get no money from the Court, and my wife, who had  for a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was  taken violently ill towards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever,  epilepsy and phrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three  children were at once attacked with smallpox. Leopold with his army  occupied the town beyond the river just as I lost the dearest of my  sons, him whose nativity you will find in my book on the new star. The  town on this side of the river where I lived was harassed by the  Bohemian troops, whose new levies were insubordinate and insolent; to  complete the whole, the Austrian army brought the plague with them into  the city. I went into Austria and endeavoured to procure the situation  which I now hold. Returning in June, I found my wife in a decline from  her grief at the death of her son, and on the eve of an infectious  fever, and I lost her also within eleven days of my return. Then came  fresh annoyance, of course, and her fortune was to be divided with my  step-sisters. The Emperor Rudolph would not agree to my departure; vain  hopes were given me of being paid from Saxony; my time and money were  wasted together, till on the death of the Emperor in 1612, I was named  again by his successor, and suffered to depart to Linz.\"    Being thus left a widower with a ten-year-old daughter Susanna, and a  boy Louis of half her age, he looked for a second wife to take charge of  them. He has given an account of eleven ladies whose suitability he  considered. The first, an intimate friend of his first wife, ultimately  declined; one was too old, another an invalid, another too proud of her  birth and quarterings, another could do nothing useful, and so on.  Number eight kept him guessing for three months, until he tired of her  constant indecision, and confided his disappointment to number nine, who  was not impressed. Number ten, introduced by a friend, Kepler found  exceedingly ugly and enormously fat, and number eleven apparently too  young. Kepler then reconsidered one of the earlier ones, disregarding  the advice of his friends who objected to her lowly station. She was the  orphan daughter of a cabinetmaker, educated for twelve years by favour  of the Lady of Stahrenburg, and Kepler writes of her: \"Her person and  manners are suitable to mine; no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to  work; she has a tolerable knowledge of how to manage a family;  middle-aged and of a disposition and capability to acquire what she  still wants\".    Wine from the Austrian vineyards was plentiful and cheap at the time of  the marriage, and Kepler bought a few casks for his household. When the  seller came to ascertain the quantity, Kepler noticed that no proper  allowance was made for the bulging parts, and the upshot of his  objections was that he wrote a book on a new method of gauging--one of  the earliest specimens of modern analysis, extending the properties of  plane figures to segments of cones and cylinders as being \"incorporated  circles\". He was summoned before the Diet at Ratisbon to give his  opinion on the Gregorian Reform of the Calendar, and soon afterwards was  excommunicated, having fallen foul of the Roman Catholic party at Linz  just as he had previously at Gratz, the reason apparently being that he  desired to think for himself. Meanwhile his salary was not paid any more  regularly than before, and he was forced to supplement it by publishing  what he called a \"vile prophesying almanac which is scarcely more  respectable than begging unless it be because it saves the Emperor's  credit, who abandons me entirely, and with all his frequent and recent  orders in council, would suffer me to perish with hunger\".    In 1617 he was invited to Italy to succeed Magini as Professor of  Mathematics at Bologna. Galileo urged him to accept the post, but he  excused himself on the ground that he was a German and brought up among  Germans with such liberty of speech as he thought might get him into  trouble in Italy. In 1619 Matthias died and was succeeded by Ferdinand  III, who again retained Kepler in his post. In the same year Kepler  reprinted his \"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" and also published his  \"Harmonics\" in five books dedicated to James I of England. \"The first  geometrical, on the origin and demonstration of the laws of the figures  which produce harmonious proportions; the second, architectonical, on  figurate geometry and the congruence of plane and solid regular figures;  the third, properly Harmonic, on the derivation of musical proportions  from figures, and on the nature and distinction of things relating to  song, in opposition to the old theories; the fourth, metaphysical,  psychological, and astrological, on the mental essence of Harmonics, and  of their kinds "]]]
