[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#8)"],[1,"are coming the material proofs of the spiritual  teachings. Listen to these words from Dr. Saleeby, in his recent  valuable scientific work, \"_Evolution, the Master Key_.\" He says:    \"Life is potential in matter; life-energy is not a thing unique and  created at a particular time in the past. If evolution be true, living  matter has been evolved by natural processes from matter which is,  apparently, not alive. But if life is potential in matter, it is a  thousand times more evident that Mind is potential in Life. The  evolutionist is impelled to believe that Mind is potential in matter.  (I adopt that form of words for the moment, but not without future  criticism.) The microscopic cell, a minute speck of matter that is to  become man, has in it the promise and the germ of mind. May we not then  draw the inference that the elements of mind are present in those  chemical elements--carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur,  phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chlorine--that are found in the cell.  Not only must we do so, but we must go further, since we know that each  of these elements, and every other, is built up out of one invariable  unit, the electron, and we must therefore assert that Mind is potential  in the unit of Matter--the electron itself... It is to assert the  sublime truth first perceived by Spinoza, that Mind and Matter are the  warp and woof of what Goethe called 'the living garment of God.' Both  are complementary expressions of the Unknowable Reality which underlies  both.\"    There is no such thing as non-vital attraction or repulsion. All  inclinations for or against another object, or thing, is an evidence of  Life. Each thing has sufficient life energy to enable it to carry on  its work. And as each form advances by evolution into a higher form, it  is able to have more of the Life energy manifest through it. As its  material machinery is built up, it becomes able to manifest a greater  and higher degree of Life. It is not that one thing has a low life, or  another a high life--this cannot be, for there is but One Life. It is  like the current of electricity that is able to run the most delicate  machinery or manifest a light in the incandescent lamp. Give it the  organ or machinery of manifestation, and it manifests--give it a low  form, and it will manifest a low degree--give it a high form, and it  will manifest a high degree. The same steam power runs the clumsy  engine, or the perfect apparatus which drives the most delicate  mechanism. And so it is with the One Life--its manifestations may seem  low and clumsy, or high and perfect--but it all depends upon the  material or mental machinery through which it works. There is but One  Life, manifesting in countless forms and shapes, and degrees. One Life  underlying All--in All.    From the highest forms of Life down through the animal, vegetable and  mineral kingdoms, we see Life everywhere present--Death an illusion.  Back of all visible forms of material life there is still the  beginnings of manifested life pressing forward for expression and  manifestation. And underneath all is the Spirit of Life--longing,  striving, feeling, acting.    In the mountain and the ocean--the flower and the tree--the sunset--the  dawn--the suns--the stars--all is Life--manifestations of the One Life.  Everything is Alive, quick with living force, power, action; thrilling  with vitality; throbbing with feeling; filled with activity. All is  from the One Life--and all that is from the One Life is Alive. There is  no dead substance in the Universe--there can be none--for Life cannot  Die. All is Alive. And Life is in All.    Carry with you this Central Thought of the Lesson:    CENTRAL THOUGHT: _There is but One Life, and its manifestations  comprise all the forms and shapes of the Universe. From Life comes but  Life--and Life can come only from Life. Therefore we have the right to  expect that all manifestations of the One Life should be Alive. And we  are not mocked in such belief. Not only do the highest Occult Teachings  inform us that Everything is Alive, but Modern Science has proven to us  that Life is present everywhere--even in that which was formerly  considered dead matter. It now sees that even the atom, and what lies  back of the atom, is charged with Life Energy and Action. Forms and  shapes may change, and do change--but Life remains eternal and  infinite. It cannot Die--for it is LIFE._    Peace be with thee.          THE THIRD LESSON      THE CREATIVE WILL.    In our first lesson of this series, we stated that among the other  qualities and attributes that we were compelled, by the laws of our  reason, to think that the Absolute possessed, was that of Omnipotence  or All-Power. In other words we are compelled to think of the One as  being the source and fount of all the Power there is, ever has been, or  ever can be in the Universe. Not only, as is generally supposed, that  the Power of the One is greater than any other Power,--but more than  this, that there can be no other power, and that, therefore, each and  every, any and all manifestations or forms of Power, Force or Energy  must be a part of the great one Energy which emanates from the One.    There is no escape from this conclusion, as startling as it may appear  to the mind unaccustomed to it. If there is any power not from and of  the One, from whence comes such power, for there is nothing else  outside of the One? Who or what exists outside of the One that can  manifest even the faintest degree of power of any kind? All power must  come from the Absolute, and must in its nature be but one.    Modern Science has recognized this truth, and one of its fundamental  principles is the Unity of Energy--the theory that all forms of Energy  are, at the last, One. Science holds that all forms of Energy are  interchangeable, and from this idea comes the theory of the  Conservation of Energy or Correlation of Force.    Science teaches that every manifestation of energy, power, or force,  from the operation of the law of gravitation, up to the highest form of  mental force is but the operation of the One Energy of the Universe.    Just what this Energy is, in its inner nature, Science does not know.  It has many theories, but does not advance any of them as a law. It  speaks of the Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things  proceed, but pronounces its nature to be unknowable. But some of the  latter-day scientists are veering around to the teachings of the  occultists, and are now hinting that it is something more than a mere  mechanical energy. They are speaking of it in terms of mind. Wundt, the  German scientist, whose school of thought is called voluntarism,  considers the motive-force of Energy to be something that may be called  Will. Crusius, as far back as 1744 said: \"Will is the dominating force  of the world.\" And Schopenhauer based his fascinating but gloomy  philosophy and metaphysics upon the underlying principle of an active  form of energy which he called the Will-to-Live, which he considered to  be the Thing-in-Itself, or the Absolute. Balzac, the novelist,  considered a something akin to Will, to be the moving force of the  Universe. Bulwer advanced a similar theory, and made mention of it in  several of his novels    This idea of an active, creative Will, at work in the Universe,  building up; tearing down; replacing; repairing; changing--always at  work--ever active--has been entertained by numerous philosophers and  thinkers, under different names and styles. Some, like Schopenhauer  have thought of this Will as the final thing--that which took the place  of God--the First Cause. But others have seen in this Will an active  living principle emanating from the Absolute or God, and working in  accordance with the laws impressed by Him upon it. In various forms,  this latter idea is seen all through the history of philosophical  thought. Cudsworth, the English philosopher, evolved the idea of a  something called the \"Plastic Nature,\" which so closely approaches the  Yogi idea of the Creative Will, that we feel justified in quoting a  passage from his book. He says:    \"It seems not so agreeable to reason that Nature, as a distinct thing  from the Deity, should be quite superseded or made to signify nothing,  God Himself doing all things immediately and miraculously; from whence  it would follow also that they are all done either forcibly and  violently, or else artificially only, and none of them by any inward  principle of their own.    \"This opinion is further confuted by that slow and gradual process that  in the generation of things, which would seem to be but a vain and idle  pomp or a trifling formality if the moving power were omnipotent; as  also by those errors and bungles which are committed where the matter  is inept and contumacious; which argue that the moving power be not  irresistible, and that Nature is such a thing as is not altogether  incapable (as well as human art) of being sometimes frustrated and  disappointed by the indisposition of matter. Whereas an omnipotent  moving power, as it could dispatch its work in a moment, so would it  always do it infallibly and irresistibly, no ineptitude and  stubbornness of matter being ever able to hinder such a one, or make  him bungle or fumble in anything.    \"Wherefore, since neither all things are produced fortuitously, or by  the unguided mechanism of matter, nor God himself may be reasonably  thought to do all things immediately and miraculously, it may well be  concluded that there is a Plastic Nature under him, which, as an  inferior and subordinate instrument, doth drudgingly execute that part  of his providence which consists in the regular and orderly motion of  matter; yet so as there is also besides this a higher providence to be  acknowledged, which, presiding over it, doth often supply the defects  of it, and sometimes overrules it, forasmuch as the Plastic Nature  cannot act"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#8)"],[1,"them which would carry more meaning than they contain. People can sign  themselves \"adorers\" and such like, but they do so at the peril of  good taste. It is not good that men or women \"worship\" each other--if  they succeed in preserving reciprocal love and esteem they will have  cause for great contentment.    10. PERMISSION.--No young man should ever write to a young lady any  letter, formal or informal, unless he has first sought her permission  to do so.    11. SPECIAL FORMS.--We give various forms or models of love letters to  be _studied, not copied._ We have given no replies to the forms given,  as every letter written will naturally suggest an answer. A careful  study will be a great help to many who have not enjoyed the advantages  of a literary education.

MRS. A. SMITH.      _9.--Form of Letter Accompanying a Present._        Louisville, July 6, 1895        My Dearest Nelly:        Many happy returns of the day. So fearful was I that it would      escape your memory, that I thought I would send you this      little trinket by way of reminder, I beg you to accept it and      wear it for the sake of the giver. With love and best wishes.        Believe me ever, your sincere friend,      CAROLINE COLLINS.      _10.--Returning Thanks for the Present._        Louisville, July 6, 1894.        Dear Mrs. Collins:        I am very much obliged to you for the handsome bracelet      you have sent me. How kind and thoughtful it was of you to      remember me on my birthday. I am sure I have every cause to      bless the day, and did I forget it, I have many kind friends      to remind me of it. Again thanking you for your present, which      is far too beautiful for me, and also for your kind wishes.        Believe me, your most grateful,      BERTHA SMITH.      _11.--Congratulating a Friend Upon His Marriage._        Menton, N.Y., May 24th, 1894.        My Dear Everett:        I have, to-day received the invitation to your wedding, and      as I cannot be present at that happy event to offer my      congratulations in person, I write.        I am heartily glad you are going to be married, and      congratulate you upon the wisdom of your choice. You have won      a noble as well as a beautiful woman, and one whose love will      make you a happy man to your life's end. May God grant that      trouble may not come near you but should it be your lot, you      will have a wife to whom you can look with confidence for      comfort, and whose good sense and devotion to you will be your      sure and unfailing support.        That you may both be very happy, and that your happiness may      increase with your years, is the prayer of        Your Friend, FRANK HOWARD.             *       *       *       *       *    LETTER WRITING.      Any extravagant flattery should be avoided, both as tending to disgust  those to whom it is addressed, as well as to degrade the writers,  and to create suspicion as to their sincerity. The sentiments should  spring from the tenderness of the heart, and, when faithfully and  delicately expressed, will never be read without exciting sympathy or  emotion in all hearts not absolutely deadened by insensibility.      DECLARATION OF AFFECTION.        Dear Nellie: Will you allow me, in a few plain and simple      words, respectfully to express the sincere esteem and      affection I entertain for you, and to ask whether I may      venture to hope that these sentiments are returned? I love      you truly and earnestly and knowing you admire frankness      and candor in all things, I cannot think that you will take      offense at this letter. Perhaps it is self-flattery to suppose      I have any place in your regard. Should this be so, the error      will carry with it its own punishment, for my happy dream will      be over. I will try to think otherwise, however, and shall      await your answer with hope. Trusting soon to hear from you, I      remain, dear Nellie.        Sincerely Yours,      J.L. Master        To Miss Nellie Reynolds,      Hartford, Conn.

I love you so much that I cannot find words in      which to express my feelings. I have loved you from the very      first day we met, and always shall. Do you blame me because I      write so freely? I should be unworthy of you if I did not tell      you the whole truth. Oh, Laura, can you love me in return?      I am sure I shall not be able to bear it if your answer is      unfavorable. I will study your every wish if you will give      me the right to do so. May I hope? Send just one kind word to      your sincere friend.        HARRY SMITH.      _13.--A Lover's Good-bye Before Starting on a Journey._        Pearl St., New York, March 11th, 1894.        My Dearest Nellie: I am off to-morrow, and yet not altogether,      for I leave my heart behind in your gentle keeping. You need      not place a guard over it, however, for it is as impossible    "]]]
