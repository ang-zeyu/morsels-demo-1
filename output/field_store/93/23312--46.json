He wanted to crawl in to it, and feel the girl's hand on his head, as  he had felt that other hand in the world beyond the ridge. He would have  gone--and would have urged Gray Wolf to go with him--but the man was  there. He whined, and Gray Wolf thrust her warm muzzle against his neck.  Something told them both that they were outcasts, that the plains, and  the moon, and the stars were against them now, and they slunk into the  shelter and the gloom of the forest.    Kazan could not go far. He could still smell the camp when he lay down.  Gray Wolf snuggled close to him. Gently she soothed with her soft tongue  Kazan's bleeding wounds. And Kazan, lifting his head, whined softly to  the stars.          CHAPTER VI    JOAN      On the edge of the cedar and spruce forest old Pierre Radisson built the  fire. He was bleeding from a dozen wounds, where the fangs of the wolves  had reached to his flesh, and he felt in his breast that old and  terrible pain, of which no one knew the meaning but himself. He dragged  in log after log, piled them on the fire until the flames leaped tip to  the crisping needles of the limbs above, and heaped a supply close at  hand for use later in the night.    From the sledge Joan watched him, still wild-eyed and fearful, still  trembling. She was holding her baby close to her breast. Her long heavy  hair smothered her shoulders and arms in a dark lustrous veil that  glistened and rippled in the firelight when she moved. Her young face  was scarcely a woman's to-night, though she was a mother. She looked  like a child.    Old Pierre laughed as he threw down the last armful of fuel, and stood  breathing hard.    \"It was close, _ma cheri_\" he panted through his white beard. \"We were  nearer to death out there on the plain than we will ever be again, I  hope. But we are comfortable now, and warm. Eh? You are no longer  afraid?\"    He sat down beside his daughter, and gently pulled back the soft fur  that enveloped the bundle she held in her arms. He could see one pink  cheek of baby Joan. The eyes of Joan, the mother, were like stars.    \"It was the baby who saved us,\" she whispered. \"The dogs were being torn  to pieces by the wolves, and I saw them leaping upon you, when one of  them sprang to the sledge. At first I thought it was one of the dogs.  But it was a wolf. He tore once at us, and the bearskin saved us. He was  almost at my throat when baby cried, and then he stood there, his red  eyes a foot from us, and I could have sworn again that he was a dog. In  an instant he turned, and was fighting the wolves. I saw him leap upon  one that was almost at your throat.\"    \"He _was_ a dog,\" said old Pierre, holding out his hands to the warmth.  \"They often wander away from the posts, and join the wolves. I have had  dogs do that. _Ma cheri_, a dog is a dog all his life. Kicks, abuse,  even the wolves can not change him--for long. He was one of the pack. He  came with them--to kill. But when he found _us_--\"    \"He fought for us,\" breathed the girl. She gave him the bundle, and  stood up, straight and tall and slim in the firelight. \"He fought for  us--and he was terribly hurt,\" she said. \"I saw him drag himself away.  Father, if he is out there--dying--\"    Pierre Radisson stood up. He coughed in a shuddering way, trying to  stifle the sound under his beard. The fleck of crimson that came to his  lips with the cough Joan did not see. She had seen nothing of it during  the six days they had been traveling up from the edge of civilization.  Because of that cough, and the stain that came with it, Pierre had made  more than ordinary haste.    \"I have been thinking of that,\" he said. \"He was badly hurt, and I do  not think he went far. Here--take little Joan and sit close to the fire  until I come back.\"    The moon and the stars were brilliant in the sky when he went out in the  plain. A short distance from the edge of the timber-line he stood for a  moment upon the spot where the wolves had overtaken them an hour before.  Not one of his four dogs had lived. The snow was red with their blood,  and their bodies lay stiff where they had fallen under the pack. Pierre  shuddered as he looked at them. If the wolves had not turned their first  mad attack upon the dogs, what would have become of himself, Joan and  the baby? He turned away, with another of those hollow coughs that  brought the blood to his lips.    A few yards to one side he found in the snow the trail of the strange  dog that had come with the wolves, and had turned against them in that  moment when all seemed lost. It was not a clean running trail. It was  more of a furrow in the snow, and Pierre Radisson followed it, expecting  to find the dog dead at the end of it.    In the sheltered spot to which he had dragged himself in the edge of the  forest Kazan lay for a long time after the fight, alert and watchful.  He felt no very great pain. But he had lost the power to stand upon his  legs. His flanks seemed paralyzed. Gray Wolf crouched close at his side,  sniffing the air. They could smell the camp, and Kazan could detect the  two things that were there--_man_ and _woman_. He knew that the girl was  there, where he could see the glow of the firelight through the spruce  and the cedars. He wanted to go to her. He wanted to drag himself close  in to the fire, and take Gray Wolf with him, and listen to her voice,  and feel the touch of her hand. But the man was there, and to him man  had always meant the club, the whip, pain, death.    Gray Wolf crouched close to his side, and whined softly as she urged  Kazan to flee deeper with her into the forest. At last she understood  that he could not move, and she ran nervously out into the plain, and  back again, until her footprints were thick in the trail she made. The  instincts of matehood were strong in her. It was she who first saw  Pierre Radisson coming over their trail, and she ran swiftly back to  Kazan and gave the warning.    Then Kazan caught the scent, and he saw the shadowy figure coming  through the starlight. He tried to drag himself back, but he could move  only by inches. The man came rapidly nearer. Kazan caught the glisten of  the rifle in his hand. He heard his hollow cough, and the tread of his  feet in the snow. Gray Wolf crouched shoulder to shoulder with him,  trembling and showing her teeth. When Pierre had approached within fifty  feet of them she slunk back into the deeper shadows of the spruce.    Kazan's fangs were bared menacingly when Pierre stopped and looked down  at him. With an effort he dragged himself to his feet, but fell back  into the snow again. The man leaned his rifle against a sapling and bent  over him fearlessly. With a fierce growl Kazan snapped at his extended  hands. To his surprise the man did not pick up a stick or a club. He  held out his hand again--cautiously--and spoke in a voice new to Kazan.  The dog snapped again, and growled.    The man persisted, talking to him all the time, and once his mittened  hand touched Kazan's head, and escaped before the jaws could reach it.  Again and again the man reached out his hand, and three times Kazan felt  the touch of it, and there was neither threat nor hurt in it. At last  Pierre turned away and went back over the trail.    When he was out of sight and hearing, Kazan whined, and the crest along  his spine flattened. He looked wistfully toward the glow of the fire.  The man had not hurt him, and the three-quarters of him that was dog  wanted to follow.    Gray Wolf came back, and stood with stiffly planted forefeet at his  side. She had never been this near to man before, except when the pack  had overtaken the sledge out on the plain. She could not understand.  Every instinct that was in her warned her that he was the most dangerous  of all things, more to be feared than the strongest beasts, the storms,  the floods, cold and starvation. And yet this man had not harmed her  mate. She sniffed at Kazan's back and head, where the mittened hand had  touched. Then she trotted back into the darkness again, for beyond the  edge of the forest she once more saw moving life.    The man was returning, and with him was the girl. Her voice was soft  and sweet, and there was about her the breath and sweetness of woman.  The man stood prepared, but not threatening.    \"Be careful, Joan,\" he warned.    She dropped on her knees in the snow, just out of reach.    \"Come, boy--come!\" she said gently. She held out her hand. Kazan's  muscles twitched. He moved an inch--two inches toward her. There was the  old light in her eyes and face now, the love and gentleness he had known  once before, when another woman with shining hair and eyes had come into  his life. \"Come!\" she whispered as she saw him move, and she bent a  little, reached a little farther with her hand, and at last touched his  head.    Pierre knelt beside her. He was proffering something, and Kazan smelled  meat. But it was the girl's hand that made him tremble and shiver, and  when she drew back, urging him to follow her, he dragged himself  painfully a foot or two through the snow. Not until then did the girl  see his mangled leg. In an instant she had forgotten all caution, and  was down close at his side.    \"He can't walk,\" she cried, a sudden tremble in her voice. \"Look, _mon  pere!_ Here is a terrible cut. We must carry him.\"    \"I guessed that much,\" replied Radisson. \"For that reason I brought the  blanket. _Mon Dieu_, listen to that!\"    From the darkness of the forest there came a low wailing cry.    Kazan lifted his head and a trembling whine answered in his throat. It  was Gray Wolf calling to him.    It was a miracle that Pierre Radisson should put the blanket about  Kazan, and carry him in to the camp, without scratch or bite. It was  this miracle that he achieved, with Joan's arm resting on Kazan's shaggy  neck as she held one end of the blanket. They laid him down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#8)"],[1,"ody.  \"Pericles himself,\" they urged, \"has taken away the only possible excuse  for such an act--the fear that it might be exposed to the attacks of the  Persians when at Delos, whereas it would be safe at Athens. Greece has  been outraged, and feels itself openly tyrannized over, when it sees us  using the funds--which we extorted from it for the war against the  Persians--for gilding and beautifying our city as if it were a vain  woman, and adorning it with precious marbles and statues and temples  worth a thousand talents.\" To this Pericles replied that the allies had  no right to consider how their money was spent, so long as Athens  defended them from the Persians; while they supplied neither horses,  ships, nor men, but merely money, which the Athenians had a right to  spend as they pleased, provided they afforded them that security which  it purchased. It was right, he argued, that after the city had provided  all that was necessary for war, it should devote its surplus money to  the erection of buildings which would be a glory to it for all ages,  while these works would create plenty by leaving no man unemployed, and  encouraging all sorts of handicraft, so that nearly the whole city would  earn wages, and thus derive both its beauty and its profit from itself.  For those who were in the flower of their age, military service offered  a means of earning money from the common stock; while, as he did not  wish the mechanics and lower classes to be without their share, nor yet  to see them receive it without doing work for it, he had laid the  foundations of great edifices which would require industries of every  kind to complete them; and he had done this in the interests of the  lower classes, who thus, although they remained at home, would have just  as good a claim to their share of the public funds as those who were  serving at sea, in garrison, or in the field. The different materials  used, such as stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypress-wood, and so  forth, would require special artisans for each, such as carpenters,  modelers, smiths, stone-masons, dyers, melters and moulders of gold,  and ivory painters, embroiderers, workers in relief; and also men to  bring them to the city, such as sailors and captains of ships and pilots  for such as came by sea; and, for those who came by land, carriage  builders, horse breeders, drivers, ropemakers, linen manufacturers,  shoemakers, road menders, and miners. Each trade, moreover, employed a  number of unskilled laborers, so that, in a word, there would be work  for persons of every age and every class, and general prosperity would  be the result.    These buildings were of immense size, and unequalled in beauty and  grace, as the workmen endeavored to make the execution surpass the  design in beauty; but what was most remarkable was the speed with which  they were built. All these edifices, each of which one would have  thought it would have taken many generations to complete, were all  finished during the most brilliant period of one man's administration.  In beauty each of them at once appeared venerable as soon as it was  built; but even at the present day the work looks as fresh as ever, for  they bloom with an eternal freshness which defies time, and seems to  make the work instinct with an unfading spirit of youth.    The overseer and manager of the whole was Phidias, although there were  other excellent architects and workmen, such as Callicrates and Ictinus,  who built the Parthenon on the site of the old Hecatompedon, which had  been destroyed by the Persians, and Coroebus, who began to build the  Temple of Initiation at Eleusis, but who only lived to see the columns  erected and the architraves placed upon them. On his death, Metagenes,  of Xypete, added the frieze and the upper row of columns, and Xenocles,  of Cholargos, crowned it with the domed roof over the shrine. As to the  long wall, about which Socrates says that he heard Pericles bring  forward a motion, Callicrates undertook to build it. The Odeum, which  internally consisted of many rows of seats and many columns, and  externally of a roof sloping on all sides from a central point, was said  to have been built in imitation of the king of Persia's tent, and was  built under Pericles' direction.    The Propylaea, before the Acropolis, were finished in five years by  Mnesicles the architect; and a miraculous incident during the work  seemed to show that the goddess did not disapprove, but rather  encouraged and assisted the building. The most energetic and active of  the workmen fell from a great height, and lay in a dangerous condition,  given over by his doctors. Pericles grieved much for him; but the  goddess appeared to him in a dream, and suggested a course of treatment  by which Pericles quickly healed the workman. In consequence of this, he  set up the brazen statue of Athene the Healer, near the old altar in the  Acropolis. The golden statue of the goddess was made by Phidias, and his  name appears upon the basement in the inscription. Almost everything was  in his hands, and he gave his orders to all the workmen--as has been  said before--because of his friendship with Pericles.    When the speakers of Thucydides' party complained that Pericles had  wasted the public money, and destroyed the revenue, he asked the people  in the assembly whether they thought he had spent much. When they  answered, \"Very much indeed,\" he said in reply; \"Do not, then, put it  down to the public account, but to mine; and I will inscribe my name  upon all the public buildings.\" When Pericles said this, the people,  either in admiration of his magnificence of manner, or being eager to  bear their share in the glory of the new buildings, shouted to him with  one accord to take what money he pleased from the treasury, and spend it  as he pleased, without stint. And finally, he underwent the trial of  ostracism with Thucydides, and not only succeeded in driving him into  exile, but broke up his party.    As now there was no opposition to encounter in the city, and all parties  had been blended into one, Pericles undertook the sole administration of  the home and foreign affairs of Athens, dealing with the public revenue,  the army, the navy, the islands and maritime affairs, and the great  sources of strength which Athens derived from her alliances, as well  with Greek as with foreign princes and states. Henceforth he became  quite a different man: he no longer gave way to the people, and ceased  to watch the breath of popular favor; but he changed the loose and  licentious democracy which had hitherto existed, into a stricter  aristocratic, or rather monarchical, form of government. This he used  honorably and unswervingly for the public benefit, finding the people,  as a rule, willing to second the measures which he explained to them to  be necessary and to which he asked their consent, but occasionally  having to use violence, and to force them, much against their will, to  do what was expedient; like a physician dealing with some complicated  disorder, who at one time allows his patient innocent recreation, and at  another inflicts upon him sharp pains and bitter though salutary  draughts. Every possible kind of disorder was to be found among a people  possessing so great an empire as the Athenians, and he alone was able to  bring them into harmony by playing alternately upon their hopes and  fears, checking them when overconfident, and raising their spirits when  they were cast down and disheartened. Thus, as Plato says, he was able  to prove that oratory is the art of influencing men's minds, and to use  it in its highest application, when it deals with men's passions and  characters, which, like certain strings of a musical instrument, require  a skilful and delicate touch. The secret of his power is to be found,  however, as Thucydides says, not so much in his mere oratory as in his  pure and blameless life, because he was so well known to be  incorruptible, and indifferent to money; for though he made the city,  which was a great one, into the greatest and richest city of Greece, and  though he himself became more powerful than many independent sovereigns,  who were able to leave their kingdoms to their sons, yet Pericles did  not increase by one single drachma the estate which he received from his  father. For forty years he held the first place among such men as  Ephialtes, Leocrates, Myronides, Cimon, Tolmides, and Thucydides; and,  after the fall and banishment of Thucydides by ostracism, he united in  himself for five-and-twenty years all the various offices of state,  which were supposed to last only for one year; and yet during the whole  of that period proved himself incorruptible by bribes.    As the Lacedaemonians began to be jealous of the prosperity of the  Athenians, Pericles, wishing to raise the spirit of the people and to  make them feel capable of immense operations, passed a decree, inviting  all the Greeks, whether inhabiting Europe or Asia, whether living in  large cities or small ones, to send representatives to a meeting at  Athens to deliberate about the restoration of the Greek temples which  had been burned by the barbarians, about the sacrifices which were due  in consequence of the vows which they had made to the gods on behalf of  Greece before joining battle, and about the sea, that all men might be  able to sail upon it in peace and without fear. To carry out this decree  twenty men, selected from the citizens over fifty years of age, were  sent out, five of whom invited the Ionian and Dorian Greeks in Asia and  the islands as far as Lesbos and Rhodes, five went to the inhabitants of  the Hellespont and Thrace as far as Byzantium, and five more proceeded  to Boeotia, Phocis, and Peloponnesus, passing from thence through Locris  to the neighboring continent as far as Acarnania and Ambracia; while the  remainder journeyed through Euboea to the Oetaeans and the"]]]
