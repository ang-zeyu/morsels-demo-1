Governor says Mr.  Graves is uncommon bad.\"    With this he slammed the door and locked it. I drew the board from my  pocket, laid it on my knee, glanced at my watch, and, as the coachman  climbed to his seat, I made the first entry in the little book.    \"8.58. W. by S. Start from home. Horse 13 hands.\"    The first move of the carriage on starting was to turn round as if  heading for Newington Butts, and the second entry accordingly read:    \"8.58.30. E. by N.\"    But this direction was not maintained long. Very soon we turned south  and then west and then south again. I sat with my eyes riveted on the  compass, following with some difficulty its rapid changes. The needle  swung to and fro incessantly but always within a definite arc, the  centre of which was the true direction. But this direction varied from  minute to minute in the most astonishing manner. West, south, east,  north, the carriage turned, \"boxing\" the compass until I lost all count  of direction. It was an amazing performance. Considering that the man  was driving against time on a mission of life and death urgency, his  carelessness as to direction was astounding. The tortuousness of the  route must have made the journey twice as long as it need have been  with a little more careful selection. At least so it appeared to me,  though, naturally, I was not in a position to offer an authoritative  criticism.    As far as I could judge, we followed the same route as before. Once I  heard a tug's whistle and knew that we were near the river, and we  passed the railway station, apparently at the same time as on the  previous occasion, for I heard a passenger train start and assumed that  it was the same train. We crossed quite a number of thoroughfares with  tram-lines--I had no idea there were so many--and it was a revelation to  me to find how numerous the railway arches were in this part of London  and how continually the nature of the road-metal varied.    It was by no means a dull journey this time. The incessant changes of  direction and variations in the character of the road kept me most  uncommonly busy; for I had hardly time to scribble down one entry before  the compass-needle would swing round sharply, showing that we had once  more turned a corner; and I was quite taken by surprise when the  carriage slowed down and turned into the covered way. Very hastily I  scribbled down the final entry (\"9.24. S.E. In covered way\"), and having  closed the book and slipped it and the board into my pocket, had just  opened out the newspaper when the carriage door was unlocked and opened,  whereupon I unhooked and blew out the lamp and pocketed that too,  reflecting that it might be useful later.    As on the last occasion, Mrs. Schallibaum stood in the open doorway with  a lighted candle. But she was a good deal less self-possessed this time.  In fact she looked rather wild and terrified. Even by the candle-light  I could see that she was very pale and she seemed unable to keep still.  As she gave me the few necessary words of explanation, she fidgeted  incessantly and her hands and feet were in constant movement.    \"You had better come up with me at once,\" she said. \"Mr. Graves is much  worse to-night. We will wait not for Mr. Weiss.\"    Without waiting for a reply she quickly ascended the stairs and I  followed. The room was in much the same condition as before. But the  patient was not. As soon as I entered the room, a soft, rhythmical  gurgle from the bed gave me a very clear warning of danger. I stepped  forward quickly and looked down at the prostrate figure, and the warning  gathered emphasis. The sick man's ghastly face was yet more ghastly; his  eyes were more sunken, his skin more livid; \"his nose was as sharp as a  pen,\" and if he did not \"babble of green fields\" it was because he  seemed to be beyond even that. If it had been a case of disease, I  should have said at once that he was dying. He had all the appearance of  a man <i>in articulo mortis</i>. Even as it was, feeling convinced that the  case was one of morphine poisoning, I was far from confident that I  should be able to draw him back from the extreme edge of vitality on  which he trembled so insecurely.    \"He is very ill? He is dying?\"    It was Mrs. Schallibaum's voice; very low, but eager and intense. I  turned, with my finger on the patient's wrist, and looked into the face  of the most thoroughly scared woman I have ever seen. She made no  attempt now to avoid the light, but looked me squarely in the face, and  I noticed, half-unconsciously, that her eyes were brown and had a  curious strained expression.    \"Yes,\" I answered, \"he is very ill. He is in great danger.\"    She still stared at me fixedly for some seconds. And then a very odd  thing occurred. Suddenly she squinted--squinted horribly; not with the  familiar convergent squint which burlesque artists imitate, but with  external or divergent squint of extreme near sight or unequal vision.  The effect was quite startling. One moment both her eyes were looking  straight into mine; the next, one of them rolled round until it looked  out of the uttermost corner, leaving the other gazing steadily forward.    She was evidently conscious of the change, for she turned her head away  quickly and reddened somewhat. But it was no time for thoughts of  personal appearance.    \"You can save him, doctor! You will not let him die! He must not be  allowed to die!\"    She spoke with as much passion as if he had been the dearest friend that  she had in the world, which I suspected was far from being the case. But  her manifest terror had its uses.    \"If anything is to be done to save him,\" I said, \"it must be done  quickly. I will give him some medicine at once, and meanwhile you must  make some strong coffee.\"    \"Coffee!\" she exclaimed. \"But we have none in the house. Will not tea  do, if I make it very strong?\"    \"No, it will not. I must have coffee; and I must have it quickly.\"    \"Then I suppose I must go and get some. But it is late. The shops will  be shut. And I don't like leaving Mr. Graves.\"    \"Can't you send the coachman?\" I asked.    She shook her head impatiently. \"No, that is no use. I must wait until  Mr. Weiss comes.\"    \"That won't do,\" I said, sharply. \"He will slip through our fingers  while you are waiting. You must go and get that coffee at once and bring  it to me as soon as it is ready. And I want a tumbler and some water.\"    She brought me a water-bottle and glass from the wash-stand and then,  with a groan of despair, hurried from the room.    I lost no time in applying the remedies that I had to hand. Shaking out  into the tumbler a few crystals of potassium permanganate, I filled it  up with water and approached the patient. His stupor was profound. I  shook him as roughly as was safe in his depressed condition, but  elicited no resistance or responsive movement. As it seemed very  doubtful whether he was capable of swallowing, I dared not take the risk  of pouring the liquid into his mouth for fear of suffocating him. A  stomach-tube would have solved the difficulty, but, of course, I had not  one with me. I had, however, a mouth-speculum which also acted as a gag,  and, having propped the patient's mouth open with this, I hastily  slipped off one of the rubber tubes from my stethoscope and inserted  into one end of it a vulcanite ear-speculum to serve as a funnel. Then,  introducing the other end of the tube into the gullet as far as its  length would permit, I cautiously poured a small quantity of the  permanganate solution into the extemporized funnel. To my great relief a  movement of the throat showed that the swallowing reflex still existed,  and, thus encouraged, I poured down the tube as much of the fluid as I  thought it wise to administer at one time.    The dose of permanganate that I had given was enough to neutralize any  reasonable quantity of the poison that might yet remain in the stomach.  I had next to deal with that portion of the drug which had already been  absorbed and was exercising its poisonous effects. Taking my hypodermic  case from my bag, I prepared in the syringe a full dose of atropine  sulphate, which I injected forthwith into the unconscious man's arm. And  that was all that I could do, so far as remedies were concerned, until  the coffee arrived.    I cleaned and put away the syringe, washed the tube, and then, returning  to the bedside, endeavoured to rouse the patient from his profound  lethargy. But great care was necessary. A little injudicious roughness  of handling, and that thready, flickering pulse might stop for ever; and  yet it was almost certain that if he were not speedily aroused, his  stupor would gradually deepen until it shaded off imperceptibly into  death. I went to work very cautiously, moving his limbs about, flicking  his face and chest with the corner of a wet towel, tickling the soles  of his feet, and otherwise applying stimuli that were strong without  being violent.    So occupied was I with my efforts to resuscitate my mysterious patient  that I did not notice the opening of the door, and it was with something  of a start that, happening to glance round, I perceived at the farther  end of the room the shadowy figure of a man relieved by two spots of  light reflected from his spectacles. How long he had been watching me I  cannot say, but, when he saw that I had observed him, he came  forward--though not very far--and I saw that he was Mr. Weiss.    \"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that you do not find my friend so well  to-night?\"    \"So well!\" I exclaimed. \"I don't find him well at all. I am exceedingly  anxious about him.\"    \"You don't--er--anticipate anything of a--er--anything serious, I hope?\"    \"There is no need to anticipate,\" said I. \"It is already about as  serious as it can be. I think he might die at any moment.\"    \"Good God!\" he gasped. \"You horrify me!\"    He was not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#8)"],[1,"in the way  of refreshment. I merely came in to find a friend who has promised to  spend the night with me. It is getting along toward bedtime. Have your  fun, gentlemen, if you must--but I am really too tired to join you.\"    \"Make 'im dance!\" yelled the sheepherder, giving over the attempt to  find the sum of twelve and fourteen. \"By gosh, yuh made _me_ dance  when I struck town. Make 'im dance!\"    \"You go off and lay down!\" commanded Billy again, and to emphasize his  words leaned and emptied the contents of his glass neatly inside the  collar of the sheepherder. \"Cool down, yuh Ba-ba-black-sheep!\"    The herder forgot everything after that--everything but the desire to  tear limb from limb one Charming Billy Boyle, who sat and raked his  spurs up and down the marred front of the bar and grinned maliciously  down at him. \"Go-awn off, before I take yuh all to pieces,\" he urged  wearily, already regretting the unjustifiable waste of good beer.  \"Quit your buzzing; I wanta listen over there.\"    \"Come on 'n' have a drink!\" vociferated the hospitable one. \"Yuh got  to be sociable, or yuh can't stop in _this_ man's town.\" So insistent  was he that he laid violent hold of Mr. Dill and tried to pull him  bodily to the bar.    \"Gentlemen, this passes a joke!\" protested Mr. Dill, looking around  him in his blankly melancholy way. \"I do not drink liquor. I must  insist upon your stopping this horseplay immediately!\"    \"Oh, it ain't no _play_,\" asserted the insistent one darkly. \"I mean  it, by thunder.\"    It was at this point that Charming Billy decided to have a word.  \"Here, break away, there!\" he yelled, pushing the belligerent  sheepherder to one side. \"Hands off that long person! That there's  _my_ dill pickle!\"    [Illustration: \"HANDS OFF THAT LONG PERSON! THAT THERE'S _MY_ DILL  PICKLE.\"]    Mr. Dill was released, and Billy fancied hazily that it was because  he so ordered; as a matter of fact, Mr. Dill, catching sight of him  there, had thrown the men and their importunities off as though they  had been rough-mannered boys. He literally plowed his way through them  and stopped deprecatingly before Billy.    \"It is getting late,\" he observed, mildly reproachful. \"I thought I  would show you the way to my room, if you don't mind.\"    Billy stared down at him. \"Well, I'm going to be busy for a while  yet,\" he demurred. \"I've got to lick this misguided son-of-a-gun  that's blatting around wanting to eat me alive--and I got my eyes on  your friend in the rear, there, that's saying words about you, Dilly.  Looks to me like I'm going to be some occupied for quite a spell. You  run along to bed and don't yuh bother none about _me_.\"    \"The matter is not so urgent but what I can wait until you are ready,\"  Mr. Dill told him quietly, but with decision. He folded his long arms  and ranged himself patiently alongside Billy. And Billy, regarding him  uneasily, felt convinced that though he tarried until the sun  returned Mr. Dill would stand right there and wait--like a well-broken  range-horse when the reins are dropped to the ground. Charming Billy  did not know why it made him uncomfortable, but it did and he took  immediate measures to relieve the sensation.    He turned fretfully and cuffed the clamorous sheepherder, who  seemed to lack the heart for actual hostilities but indulged in much  recrimination and was almost in tears. \"Aw, shut up!\" growled Billy.  \"A little more uh that war-talk and I'll start in and learn yuh some  manners. I don't want any more of it. Yuh hear?\"    It is a fact that trifles sometimes breed large events. Billy, to make  good his threat, jumped off the bar. In doing so he came down upon  the toes of Jack Morgan, the hospitable soul who had insisted upon  treating Mr. Dill and who had just come up to renew the argument. Jack  Morgan was a man of uncertain temper and he also had toes exceedingly  tender. He struck out, missed Billy, who was thinking only of the  herder, and it looked quite as though the blow was meant for Mr. Dill.    After that, things happened quickly and with some confusion. Others  became active, one way or the other, and the clamor was great, so  that it was easily heard down the street and nearly emptied the other  saloons.    When the worst of it was over and one could tell for a certainty what  was taking place, Charming Billy was holding a man's face tightly  against the bar and was occasionally beating it with his fist none too  gently. Mr. Dill, an arm's length away, had Jack Morgan and one other  offender clutched by the neck in either hand and he was solemnly and  systematically butting their heads together until they howled. The  bartender had just succeeded in throwing the sheepherder out through  the back door, and he was wiping his hands and feeling very well  satisfied with himself.    \"I'd oughta fired him long ago, when he first commenced building  trouble,\" he remarked, to no one in particular. \"The darned  lamb-licker--he's broke and has been all evening. I don't know what  made me stand for 'im long as I did.\"    Billy, moved perhaps by weariness rather than mercy, let go his man  and straightened up, feeling mechanically for his hat. His eyes met  those of the melancholy Mr. Dill.    \"If you're quite through\"--bang! went the heads--\"perhaps we may as  well\"--bang!--\"leave this unruly crowd\"--bang!!--\"and go to our room.  It is after eleven o'clock.\" Mr. Dill looked as though his present  occupation was unpleasant but necessary and as though, to please  Billy, he could keep it up indefinitely.    Charming Billy stood quite still, staring at the other and at what he  was doing; and while he stared and wondered, something came into the  heart of him and quite changed his destiny. He did not know what it  was, or why it was so; at the time he realized only a deep amazement  that Mr. Dill, mild of manner, correct of speech and wistful-eyed,  should be standing there banging the heads of two men who were  considered rather hard to handle. Certainly Jack Morgan was reputed a  \"bad actor\" when it came to giving blows. And while Alexander P. Dill  was a big man--an enormous man, one might say--he had none of the  earmarks of a fighting man. It was, perhaps, his very calmness that  won Billy for good and all. Before, Charming Billy had felt toward him  a certain amused pity; his instinct had been to protect Mr. Dill. He  would never feel just that way again; Mr. Dill, it would seem, was  perfectly well able to protect himself.    \"Shall we go?\" Mr. Dill poised the two heads for another bang and held  them so. By this time every one in the room was watching, but he had  eyes only for Billy.    \"Just as you say,\" Billy assented submissively.    Mr. Dill shook the two with their faces close together, led them to a  couple of chairs and set them emphatically down. \"Now, see if you can  behave yourselves,\" he advised, in the tone a father would have  used toward two refractory boys. \"You have been acting boorishly and  disgracefully all evening. It was you who directed me wrong, to-day.  You have not, at any time since I first met you, acted like gentlemen;  I should be sorry to think this country held many such brainless  louts.\" He turned inquiringly toward Charming Billy and nodded his  head toward the door. Billy, stooping unsteadily for his hat which he  discovered under his feet, followed him meekly out.          CHAPTER VII.    \"_Till Hell's a Skating-rink._\"      Charming Billy opened his eyes slowly, but with every sense at the  normal degree of alertness; which was a way he had, born of light  sleeping and night-watching. He had slept heavily, from the feel of  his head, and he remembered the unwisdom of drinking four glasses of  whisky and then changing irresponsibly to beer. He had not undressed,  it would seem, and he was lying across the middle of a bed with his  spurred boots hanging over the edge. A red comforter had been thrown  across him, and he wondered why. He looked around the room and  discovered Mr. Dill seated in a large, cane rocker--which was  unquestionably not big enough for his huge person--his feet upon  another chair and his hands folded inertly on his drawn-up knees. He  was asleep, with his head lying against the chair-back and his face  more melancholy than ever and more wistful. His eyes, Billy observed,  were deep-sunk and dark-ringed. He sat up suddenly--did Billy, and  threw off the cover with some vehemence. \"Darn me for a drunken  chump!\" he exclaimed, and clanked over to the chair.    \"Here, Dilly\"--to save the life of him he could not refrain from  addressing him so--\"why in thunder didn't yuh kick me awake, and make  me get off your bed? What did yuh let me do it for--and you setting up  all night--oh, this is sure a hell of a note!\"    Mr. Dill opened his eyes, stared blankly and came back from his  dreaming. \"You were so--so impatient when I tried to get you up,\" he  explained in a tired voice. \"And you had a way of laying your hands on  your revolver when I insisted. It seems you took me for a shepherd  and were very unfriendly; so I thought it best to let you stay as you  were, but I'm afraid you were not very comfortable. One can rest so  much better between sheets. You would not,\" he added plaintively,  \"even permit me to take your boots off for you.\"    Charming Billy sat down upon the edge of the bed, all tousled as he  was, and stared abstractedly at Mr. Dill. Perhaps he had never before  felt so utterly disgusted with himself, or realized so keenly his  shortcomings. Not even the girl had humbled him so completely as had  this long, lank, sinfully grammatical man from Michigan.    \"You've sure got me where I live, Dilly,\" he said slowly and  haltingly, feeling mechanically for the makings of a smoke. \"Charming  Billy Boyle ain't got a word to say for himself. But if yuh ain't  plumb sick and disgusted with the spectacle I've made uh myself, yuh  can count on me till hell's a skating-rink. I ain't"]]]
