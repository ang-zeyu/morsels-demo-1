Soon is the tale told thereof: nine nights together came the she-wolf  at midnight, and each night slew and ate up one of the brethren, until  all were dead, save Sigmund only; so now, before the tenth night came,  Signy sent that trusty man to Sigmund, her brother, and gave honey into  his hand, bidding him do it over Sigmund's face, and set a little deal  of it in his mouth; so he went to Sigmund and did as he was bidden, and  then came home again; and so the next night came the she-wolf according  to her wont, and would slay him and eat him even as his brothers; but  now she sniffs the breeze from him, whereas he was anointed with the  honey, and licks his face all over with her tongue, and then thrusts  her tongue into the mouth of him. No fear he had thereof, but caught  the she-wolf's tongue betwixt his teeth, and so hard she started back  thereat, and pulled herself away so mightily, setting her feet against  the stocks, that all was riven asunder; but he ever held so fast that the  tongue came away by the roots, and thereof she had her bane.    But some men say that this same she-wolf was the mother of King  Siggeir, who had turned herself into this likeness by troll's lore and  witchcraft.        CHAPTER VI. Of how Signy sent the Children of her and Siggeir to  Sigmund.    Now whenas Sigmund is loosed and the stocks are broken, he dwells in the  woods and holds himself there; but Signy sends yet again to wot of the  tidings, whether Sigmund were alive or no; but when those who were sent  came to him, he told them all as it had betid, and how things had gone  betwixt him and the wolf; so they went home and tell Signy the tidings;  but she goes and finds her brother, and they take counsel in such wise  as to make a house underground in the wild-wood; and so things go on a  while, Signy hiding him there, and sending him such things as he needed;  but King Siggeir deemed that all the Volsungs were dead.    Now Siggeir had two sons by his wife, whereof it is told that when the  eldest was ten winters old, Signy sends him to Sigmund, so that he might  give him help, if he would in any wise strive to avenge his father;  so the youngling goes to the wood, and comes late in evening-tide to  Sigmund's earth-house; and Sigmund welcomed him in seemly fashion, and  said that he should make ready their bread; \"But I,\" said he, \"will go  seek firewood.\"    Therewith he gives the meal-bag into his hands while he himself went to  fetch firing; but when he came back the youngling had done naught at the  bread-making. Then asks Sigmund if the bread be ready--    Says the youngling, \"I durst not set hand to the meal sack, because  somewhat quick lay in the meal.\"    Now Sigmund deemed he wotted that the lad was of no such heart as that  he would be fain to have him for his fellow; and when he met his sister,  Sigmund said that he had come no nigher to the aid of a man though the  youngling were with him.    Then said Signy, \"Take him and kill him then; for why should such an one  live longer?\" and even so he did.    So this winter wears, and the next winter Signy sent her next son to  Sigmund; and there is no need to make a long tale thereof, for in like  wise went all things, and he slew the child by the counsel of Signy.        CHAPTER VII. Of the Birth of Sinfjotli the Son of Sigmund.    So on a tide it befell as Signy sat in her bower, that there came to her  a witch-wife exceeding cunning, and Signy talked with her in such wise,  \"Fain am I,\" says she, \"that we should change semblances together.\"    She says, \"Even as thou wilt then.\"    And so by her wiles she brought it about that they changed semblances,  and now the witch-wife sits in Signy's place according to her rede, and  goes to bed by the king that night, and he knows not that he has other  than Signy beside him.    But the tale tells of Signy, that she fared to the earth-house of her  brother, and prayed him give her harbouring for the night; \"For I have  gone astray abroad in the woods, and know not whither I am going.\"    So he said she might abide, and that he would not refuse harbour to one  lone woman, deeming that she would scarce pay back his good cheer by  tale-bearing: so she came into the house, and they sat down to meat,  and his eyes were often on her, and a goodly and fair woman she seemed  to him; but when they are full, then he says to her, that he is right  fain that they should have but one bed that night; she nowise turned  away therefrom, and so for three nights together he laid her in bed by  him.    Thereafter she fared home, and found the witch-wife and bade her change  semblances again, and she did so.    Now as time wears, Signy brings forth a man-child, who was named  Sinfjotli, and when he grew up he was both big and strong, and fair of  face, and much like unto the kin of the Volsungs, and he was hardly yet  ten winters old when she sent him to Sigmund's earth-house; but this  trial she had made of her other sons or ever she had sent them to  Sigmund, that she had sewed gloves on to their hands through flesh and  skin, and they had borne it ill and cried out thereat; and this she now  did to Sinfjotli, and he changed countenance in nowise thereat. Then she  flayed off the kirtle so that the skin came off with the sleeves, and  said that this would be torment enough for him; but he said--    \"Full little would Volsung have felt such a smart this.\"    So the lad came to Sigmund, and Sigmund bade him knead their meal up,  while he goes to fetch firing; so he gave him the meal-sack, and then  went after the wood, and by then he came back had Sinfjotli made an end  of his baking. Then asked Sigmund if he had found nothing in the meal.    \"I misdoubted me that there was something quick in the meal when I first  fell to kneading of it, but I have kneaded it all up together, both the  meal and that which was therein, whatsoever it was.\"    Then Sigmund laughed out, he said--    \"Naught wilt thou eat of this bread to-night, for the most deadly of  worms (1) hast thou kneaded up therewith.\"    Now Sigmund was so mighty a man that he might eat venom and have no hurt  therefrom; but Sinfjotli might abide whatso venom came on the outside of  him, but might neither eat nor drink thereof.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Serpents.        CHAPTER VIII. The Death of King Siggeir and of Signy.    The tale tells that Sigmund thought Sinfjotli over young to help him to  his revenge, and will first of all harden him with manly deeds; so in  summer-tide they fare wide through the woods and slay men for their  wealth; Sigmund deems him to take much after the kin of the Volsungs,  though he thinks that he is Siggeir's son, and deems him to have the  evil heart of his father, with the might and daring of the Volsungs;  withal he must needs think him in no wise a kinsome man, for full oft  would he bring Sigmund's wrongs to his memory, and prick him on to slay  King Siggeir.    Now on a time as they fare abroad in the wood for the getting of wealth,  they find a certain house, and two men with great gold rings asleep  therein: now these twain were spell-bound skin-changers, (1) and  wolf-skins were hanging up over them in the house; and every tenth  day might they come out of those skins; and they were kings' sons: so  Sigmund and Sinfjofli do the wolf-skins on them, and then might they  nowise come out of them, though forsooth the same nature went with them  as heretofore; they howled as wolves howl, but both knew the meaning of  that howling; they lay out in the wild-wood, and each went his way; and  a word they made betwixt them, that they should risk the onset of seven  men, but no more, and that he who was first to be set on should howl in  wolfish wise: \"Let us not depart from this,\" says Sigmund, \"for thou art  young and over-bold, and men will deem the quarry good, when they take  thee.\"    Now each goes his way, and when they were parted, Sigmund meets certain  men, and gives forth a wolf's howl; and when Sinfjotli heard it, he went  straightway thereto, and slew them all, and once more they parted. But  ere Sinfjotli has fared long through the woods, eleven men meet him,  and he wrought in such wise that he slew them all, and was awearied  therewith, and crawls under an oak, and there takes his rest. Then came  Sigmund thither, and said--    \"Why didst thou not call on me?\"    Sinfjotli said, \"I was loth to call for thy help for the slaying of  eleven men.\"    Then Sigmund rushed at him so hard that he staggered and fell, and  Sigmund bit him in the throat. Now that day they might not come out of  their wolf-skins: but Sigmund lays the other on his back, and bears  him home to the house, and cursed the wolf-gears and gave them to the  trolls. Now on a day he saw where two weasels went, and how that one bit  the other in the throat, and then ran straightway into the thicket, and  took up a leaf and laid it on the wound, and thereon his fellow sprang  up quite and clean whole; so Sigmund went out and saw a raven flying  with a blade of that same herb to him; so he took it and drew it over  Sinfjotli's hurt, and he straightway sprang up as whole as though he had  never been hurt. Thereafter they went home to their earth-house, and  abode there till the time came for them to put off the wolf-shapes; then  they burnt them up with fire, and prayed that no more hurt might come  to any one from them; but in that uncouth guise they wrought many famous  deeds in the kingdom and lordship of King Siggeir.    Now when Sinfjotli was come to man's estate, Sigmund deemed he had tried  him fully, and or ever a long time has gone by he turns his mind to the  avenging of his father, if so it may be brought about; so on a certain "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#8)"],[1,"went to Oman, returning again to take  up an assignment with the Hindu, where he currently  works.    So the Rajan era has finally come to an end at the Herald  . Sad though it may seem in human terms, it is unlikely  to surprise anyone who has at least a nodding  acquaintance with his brand of journalism -- especially  his strident and sensational approach to contentious  issues, such as the language agitation of the 'eighties.    By the time I arrived in Goa, the Herald (formerly O Heraldo  ) had celebrated the third anniversary of its  re-incarnation as an Englishman -- but it was not yet  out of the birth pangs. It often looked like a one-man  show. The six-to-eight page broad-sheet was Rajan  Narayan's play-field, and he played with gusto -- solo  at times, fast and loose frequently. His output was  phenomenal. He wrote the lead story, the front-page  anchor, the edit almost everyday, six days a week, for  several years. Besides, there also was the long-winded  'Stray Thoughts', on Sundays.    Life at The Navhind Times was sedentary by comparison.    In keeping with the image of Goa being a land of  laid-back lotus eaters, the NT staffers were under no  pressure to perform. Being the dominant daily, news  came naturally to the NT. In those days, it operated  out of a small rented building, adjoining a bar and  restaurant, on the outskirts of Panjim as the new  building near the Panjim market was under construction.  The bar and the building belonged to the then Mayor of Panjim,  an affable man whose employees entertained the NT  staffers on credit. The editorial staff got an off-day  after two days of work -- that's 10 offs a month, which  was a luxury that journalists in other papers could not  dream of.    The first thing that struck one about the  English-language Press in Goa in those days was its  utter lack of respect for the readers' intelligence.  I'm sorry if this view offends anyone, but the  small-town mentality, the self-serious posturing and  the patronising editorialisation of news reports were  all too obvious in both the NT and Herald.    But there ended the similarity. In other respects, the  two papers were a study in contrast. Herald was  technologically superior. Having introduced computers  ahead of the NT, its printing was neater but the paper  was replete with errors -- typographical as well as  factual. The NT too had its share of typos. But it made  few factual errors, because, as critics would say, it  seldom reported facts!    The NT used vintage Lino machines for composing and its  antiquated printing machine broke down quite often. The  morning paper hit the news-stands well after 10 am on  such occasions. The printing was awful -- full of black  patches, missing letters and blank spaces that  challenged the imagination of the reader. Still it  retained its readership, mainly because it was  perceived as the more credible of the two.    Rajan Narayan failed to rise to the occasion and offer  a credible alternative. Herald behaved like a spoilt  brat throwing tantrums. It lacked a sense of  proportion. Too often, it played to the gallery, fanned  sectarian passions and threw norms to the wind. With  its rabble-rousing shrillness, Herald managed to gain a  foothold among a section of the Goan population,  especially in South Goa where the NT was perennially  late to arrive. But Herald was not taken seriously even  by its ardent supporters. Journalist Devika Sequeira  once summed up the situation neatly: Herald was  laughable and the NT evoked tears!    All that changed with the arrival of the Gomantak Times  . The NT Chief Reporter Pramod Khandeparker quit to  join the GT. The NT was jolted out of its complacency  -- it was facing a challenge it had never faced before.  Work on the new building was speeded up, and the  relocation carried out in a hurry. Computers were  installed and a new printing machine was ready.    But all that was not enough to ward off a threat from  the rivals. Its content had to improve. Acting Editor  M.M. Mudaliar was in a bad mood. His calm and composed  disposition gave way to a brittle temper. He yelled at  the management people, and threatened to have the  editorial staff sacked.    One day, I diffidently approached him with a piece of  writing and asked for permission to launch a column in  the Sunday supplement. He was reluctant. I was new and  untested. And I was not even a regular -- I was on  voucher payment. But he decided to give it a try and  carried the piece on the front page of the Sunday  Magazine. It was titled 'A peep into Goan psyche'. The  column was called 'Small Talk' and it appeared under  the pseudonym of R.K. Yen. The response to the first  piece was incredibly good. Mudaliar readily published  the second one and, when the third piece appeared, I  got the appointment order.    By then Mudaliar had been confirmed as Editor and the  paper was ready to face the world with new vigour. The  editorial offs were curtailed to once a week. The  printing improved and new features and columns were  gradually introduced. The NT had arrived. The threat  from GT looked feeble now. They had good journalists  and better technology, but had forgotten to hire good  proof-readers. The paper was full of typos, even in  headlines.    The NT was relieved -- at least temporarily.    The arrival of GT had a big impact on the Herald too.  Rajan Narayan began to behave like one possessed. He  blamed Chief Minister Pratapsing Rane and the NT for  all the ills of the world. His frustration was  beginning to show. He railed against the NT and Rane at  the drop of a hat. Once, two people were killed in  police-firing in Vasco following a group clash. It was  the lead in the next day's NT, but the Herald  completely missed the news.    A reader's letter was published in Herald a few days  later: \"Where was your reporter when the firing took  place in Vasco? Had he gone to Baina for a quickie?\"  The Editor's reply: \"We don't enjoy the patronage of  Chief Minister Pratapsing Raoji Rane. So we missed the news.\"   (As if Rane had called in the NT and given out the news!)    Rajan Narayan is essentially a rhetorician. He has a  way with words and can argue his case convincingly. But  his writings carried little conviction, which was the  major reason for Herald's credibility crisis in those  days. But the fact that he changed the media scene  there cannot be disputed. In my view, the fundamental  error he made was to plunge into the middle of things,  rather than remaining a level-headed observer that a  good journalist is supposed to be. He made an  over-zealous effort to ingratiate himself with a  section of the Goan society and failed miserably. The  fact that even today his Goan credentials are  questioned bears this out.    As everything has two sides, the Herald experiment (if  one could call it that) too had its pros and cons. The  single most significant achievement of Herald, in my  opinion, was to raise a breed of bright young  journalists who cut their teeth in journalism there.  Most of them left disillusioned and bitter with the  paper and its Editor, but they have done reasonably  well elsewhere. But for Herald, they would not have  come to this field.    And Herald did manage to provide some relief (comic  relief, according to critics) from the tedious fare  offered by the NT. It was sharp and pungent -- too  pungent for many. Almost every report packed a sting in  its tail. Some of the fare dished out in the guise of  investigative journalism was just gossip laced with  outrageous bias. But all this lighted the scene up and  served as a reminder to the NT to wake up and take notice.    Rajan Narayan never hesitated to name his rivals,  especially the NT, while making disparaging remarks.  The NT, on the other hand, took a diametrically  opposite stance: it skirted controversies altogether.  Its unwritten policy was never to report or comment on  anything controversial, let alone naming names!    But that had to change to keep pace with the changing  times. I lampooned Rajan Narayan in my columns  occasionally, which Mudaliar permitted reluctantly. It  must be said to Rajan Narayan's credit that he not only  took my pot-shots in good humour, but, according to  Herald sources, also stopped a couple of juniors who  wanted to hit back at me.    I met Rajan Narayan only once; but then it was hardly a  meeting. Rather, I saw him from a distance at a  midnight carnival in Panjim. After the edition was  over, my NT colleague Anthony and I decided to take a  round. We saw Rajan Narayan surrounded by a group of  revellers. In a red T-shirt and bermudas, with a red  ribbon around his head and a glass of feni in hand, a  wobbly Rajan Narayan with bleary eyes was quite a  spectacle. Anthony nudged me and asked, \"Can you  imagine Mudaliar in such a scene?\"    Never. Mudaliar was, by comparison, dapper. In fact,  his first advice to me when I called on him for a job  interview was to be always mindful of my reputation.  \"It's a small place. Everybody knows everybody. And  liquor is cheap here,\" he had said.    I left Goa rather bitterly.    I fell out with Mudaliar over an innocuous remark in my  column. I used to report the traditional cricket match  between the legislators and journalists in the column  in a running commentary form. That year (1989), the  Legislators XI led by Chief Minister Rane trounced the  Press XI, led by Mudaliar. I made a passing remark that  age was apparently catching up with Mudaliar. He deemed  it too personal, and stopped talking to me. There were  enough people around to fan the fire; and he refused to  recommend me for a promotion. One thing led to another  and I soon decided that my future lay elsewhere.    But I've no hard feelings about anything now. In fact,  I recall my days in Goa with nostalgia and gratitude.  It was a turning point in my career and I fondly  remember my association with a wonderful people. I"]]]
