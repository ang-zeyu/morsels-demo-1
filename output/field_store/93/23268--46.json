(#7)"],[1,"unfold.\"    Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:  We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space  Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;  Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.          CANTO XI    UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,  By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,  Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:  And here to shun the horrible excess  Of fetid exhalation, upward cast  From the profound abyss, behind the lid  Of a great monument we stood retir'd,    Whereon this scroll I mark'd: \"I have in charge  Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew  From the right path.--Ere our descent behooves  We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,  To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward  Regard it not.\"  My master thus; to whom  Answering I spake: \"Some compensation find  That the time past not wholly lost.\"  He then:  \"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!  My son! within these rocks,\" he thus began,  \"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,  As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full  Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone  Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how  And for what cause in durance they abide.    \"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,  The end is injury; and all such end  Either by force or fraud works other's woe  But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,  To God is more displeasing; and beneath  The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure  Severer pang.  The violent occupy  All the first circle; and because to force  Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds  Each within other sep'rate is it fram'd.  To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man  Force may be offer'd; to himself I say  And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear  At full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds  Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes  By devastation, pillage, and the flames,  His substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites  In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence  The torment undergo of the first round  In different herds.  Man can do violence  To himself and his own blessings: and for this  He in the second round must aye deplore  With unavailing penitence his crime,  Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,  In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,  And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.  To God may force be offer'd, in the heart  Denying and blaspheming his high power,  And nature with her kindly law contemning.  And thence the inmost round marks with its seal  Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak  Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts.    \"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,  May be by man employ'd on one, whose trust  He wins, or on another who withholds  Strict confidence.  Seems as the latter way  Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.  Whence in the second circle have their nest  Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,  Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce  To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,  With such vile scum as these.  The other way  Forgets both Nature's general love, and that  Which thereto added afterwards gives birth  To special faith.  Whence in the lesser circle,  Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,  The traitor is eternally consum'd.\"    I thus: \"Instructor, clearly thy discourse  Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm  And its inhabitants with skill exact.  But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,  Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,  Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,  Wherefore within the city fire-illum'd  Are not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?  And if it be not, wherefore in such guise  Are they condemned?\"  He answer thus return'd:  \"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,  Not so accustom'd? or what other thoughts  Possess it?  Dwell not in thy memory  The words, wherein thy ethic page describes  Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,  Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,  And how incontinence the least offends  God, and least guilt incurs?  If well thou note  This judgment, and remember who they are,  Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,  Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd  From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours  Justice divine on them its vengeance down.\"    \"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,  Thou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,  That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.  Yet somewhat turn thee back,\" I in these words  Continu'd, \"where thou saidst, that usury  Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot  Perplex'd unravel.\"  He thus made reply:  \"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,  Clearly points out, not in one part alone,  How imitative nature takes her course  From the celestial mind and from its art:  And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,  Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well  Thou shalt discover, that your art on her  Obsequious follows, as the learner treads  In his instructor's step, so that your art  Deserves the name of second in descent  From God.  These two, if thou recall to mind  Creation's holy book, from the beginning  Were the right source of life and excellence  To human kind.  But in another path  The usurer walks; and Nature in herself  And in her follower thus he sets at nought,  Placing elsewhere his hope.  But follow now  My steps on forward journey bent; for now  The Pisces play with undulating glance  Along the horizon, and the Wain lies all  O'er the north-west; and onward there a space  Is our steep passage down the rocky height.\"          CANTO XII    THE place where to descend the precipice  We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge  Such object lay, as every eye would shun.    As is that ruin, which Adice's stream  On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,  Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;  For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd  To the low level, so the headlong rock  Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give  To him who from above would pass; e'en such  Into the chasm was that descent: and there  At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd  The infamy of Crete, detested brood  Of the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us  It gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.    To him my guide exclaim'd: \"Perchance thou deem'st  The King of Athens here, who, in the world  Above, thy death contriv'd.  Monster! avaunt!  He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,  But to behold your torments is he come.\"    Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring  Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow  Hath struck him, but unable to proceed  Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge  The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:  \"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well  That thou descend.\"  Thus down our road we took  Through those dilapidated crags, that oft  Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs  Unus'd.  I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:    \"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,  Guarded by the brute violence, which I  Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst  Hither descended to the nether hell,  This rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt  (If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,  Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil  Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds  Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,  I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,  Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft  Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point,  Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.  But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood  Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,  Who have by violence injur'd.\"  O blind lust!  O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on  In the brief life, and in the eternal then  Thus miserably o'erwhelm us.  I beheld  An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,  As circling all the plain; for so my guide  Had told.  Between it and the rampart's base  On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,  As to the chase they on the earth were wont.    At seeing us descend they each one stood;  And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows  And missile weapons chosen first; of whom  One cried from far: \"Say to what pain ye come  Condemn'd, who down this steep have journied?  Speak  From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.\"    To whom my guide: \"Our answer shall be made  To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.  Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.\"    Then me he touch'd, and spake: \"Nessus is this,  Who for the fair Deianira died,  And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.  He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,  Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;  That other Pholus, prone to wrath.\"  Around  The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts  At whatsoever spirit dares emerge  From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.    We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,  Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,  And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard  To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view  Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:  \"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind  Moves what he touches?  The feet of the dead  Are not so wont.\"  My trusty guide, who now  Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,  Thus made reply: \"He is indeed alive,  And solitary so must needs by me  Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd  By strict necessity, not by delight.  She left her joyful harpings in the sky,  Who this new office to my care consign'd.  He is no robber, no dark spirit I.  But by that virtue, which empowers my step  To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,  One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,  Who to the ford may lead us, and convey  Across, him mounted on his back; for he  Is not a spirit that may walk the air.\"    Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus  To Nessus spake: \"Return, and be their guide.  And if ye chance to cross another troop,  Command them keep aloof.\"  Onward we mov'd,  The faithful escort by our side,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#7)"],[1," thy lab'ring view,  What underneath those stones approacheth: now,  E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.\"    Christians and proud! poor and wretched ones!  That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust  Upon unstaid perverseness! now ye not  That we are worms, yet made at last to form  The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes  That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?  Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?  Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,  Like the untimely embryon of a worm!    As, to support incumbent floor or roof,  For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,  That crumples up its knees unto its breast,  With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd  In the beholder's fancy; so I saw  These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.    Each, as his back was laden, came indeed  Or more or less contract; but it appear'd  As he, who show'd most patience in his look,  Wailing exclaim'd: \"I can endure no more.\"          CANTO XI    \"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make  The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,  But that with love intenser there thou view'st  Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:  Join each created being to extol  Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise  Is thy blest Spirit.  May thy kingdom's peace  Come unto us; for we, unless it come,  With all our striving thither tend in vain.  As of their will the angels unto thee  Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne  With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done  By saintly men on earth.  Grant us this day  Our daily manna, without which he roams  Through this rough desert retrograde, who most  Toils to advance his steps.  As we to each  Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou  Benign, and of our merit take no count.  'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not  Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free  From his incitements and defeat his wiles.  This last petition, dearest Lord! is made  Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,  But for their sakes who after us remain.\"    Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,  Those spirits went beneath a weight like that  We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,  But with unequal anguish, wearied all,  Round the first circuit, purging as they go,  The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf  If there vows still be offer'd, what can here  For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills  Have root of goodness in them?  Well beseems  That we should help them wash away the stains  They carried hence, that so made pure and light,  They may spring upward to the starry spheres.    \"Ah! so may mercy-temper'd justice rid  Your burdens speedily, that ye have power  To stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire  Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand  Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.  And if there be more passages than one,  Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;  For this man who comes with me, and bears yet  The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,  Despite his better will but slowly mounts.\"  From whom the answer came unto these words,  Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:    \"Along the bank to rightward come with us,  And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil  Of living man to climb: and were it not  That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith  This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop  My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,  Whose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.  To mark if e'er I knew himnd to crave  His pity for the fardel that I bear.  I was of Latiun,  of a Tuscan horn  A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name  My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.  My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds  Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot  The common mother, and to such excess,  Wax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,  Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,  Each child in Campagnatico, can tell.  I am Omberto; not me only pride  Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd  In mischief with her.  Here my lot ordains  Under this weight to groan, till I appease  God's angry justice, since I did it not  Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.\"    List'ning I bent my visage down: and one  (Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight  That urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,  Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd  Intent upon me, stooping as I went  Companion of their way.  \"O!\"  I exclaim'd,    \"Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou  Agobbio's glory, glory of that art  Which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?\"    \"Brother!\" said he, \"with tints that gayer smile,  Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.  His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.  In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,  The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal  For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.  Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.  Nor were I even here; if, able still  To sin, I had not turn'd me unto God.  O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd  E'en in its height of verdure, if an age  Less bright succeed not! imbue thought  To lord it over painting's field; and now  The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.  Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd  The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,  Who shall drive either from their nest.  The noise  Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,  That blows from divers points, and shifts its name  Shifting the point it blows from.  Shalt thou more  Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh  Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,  Before the coral and the pap were left,  Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that  Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,  Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye  To the heaven's slowest orb.  He there who treads  So leisurely before me, far and wide  Through Tuscany resounded once; and now  Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:  There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught  The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day  Proud as she now is loathsome.  Your renown  Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,  And his might withers it, by whom it sprang  Crude from the lap of earth.\"  I thus to him:  \"True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe  The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay  What tumours rankle there.  But who is he  Of whom thou spak'st but now?\"--\"This,\" he replied,  \"Is Provenzano.  He is here, because  He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway  Of all Sienna.  Thus he still hath gone,  Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.  Such is th' acquittance render'd back of him,  Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth.\"  I then:  \"If soul that to the verge of life delays  Repentance, linger in that lower space,  Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,  How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?\"    \"When at his glory's topmost height,\" said he,  \"Respect of dignity all cast aside,  Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,  A suitor to  redeem his suff'ring friend,  Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,  Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein  To tremble.  More I will not say; and dark,  I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon  Shall help thee to a comment on the text.  This is the work, that from these limits freed him.\"          CANTO XII    With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,  I with that laden spirit journey'd on  Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me;  But when he bade me quit him, and proceed  (For \"here,\" said he, \"behooves with sail and oars  Each man, as best he may, push on his bark\"),  Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd  My body, still in thought submissive bow'd.    I now my leader's track not loth pursued;  And each had shown how light we far'd along  When thus he warn'd me: \"Bend thine eyesight down:  For thou to ease the way shall find it good  To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.\"    As in memorial of the buried, drawn  Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form  Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof  Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,  Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),  So saw I there, but with more curious skill  Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space  From forth the mountain stretches.  On one part  Him I beheld, above all creatures erst  Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:  On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd  Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint  Of mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god  With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,  Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs  Strewn o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw:  At foot of the stupendous work he stood,  As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd  Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.    O Niobe! in what a trance of woe  Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,  Sev'n sons on either side thee slain!  Saul!  How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword  Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour  Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!    O fond Arachne! thee I also saw  Half spider now in anguish crawling up  Th' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!    O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem  Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote  With none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.    Was shown beside upon the solid floor  How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate  That ornament in evil hour receiv'd:  How in the temple on Sennacherib fell  His sons, and how a corpse they left him there.  Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made  By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:  \"Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!\"  Was shown how routed in the battle fled  Th' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en  The relics of the carnage.  Troy I mark'd  In ashes and in caverns.  Oh! how fall'n,  How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!    What master of the pencil or the style  Had trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made  The subtlest workman wonder?  Dead the dead,  The living seem'd alive; with clearer view  His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,"]]]
