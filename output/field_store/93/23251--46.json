But my stomach craves food, and food it shall have!\"    Saying this he brushed past the steward and tried the door, but it  was locked fast; whereat the fat steward chuckled and jangled his keys  again.    Then was Little John right mad, and he brought down his huge fist on the  door-panel with a sledge-hammer blow that shivered an opening you could  thrust your hand into. Little John stooped and peered through the hole  to see what food lay within reach, when crack! went the steward's keys  upon his crown, and the worthy danced around him playing a tattoo that  made Little John's ears ring. At this he turned upon the steward and  gave him such a rap that his back went nigh in two, and over went the  fat fellow rolling on the floor.    \"Lie there,\" quoth Little John, \"till ye find strength to go to bed.  Meanwhile, I must be about my dinner.\" And he kicked open the buttery  door without ceremony and brought to light a venison pasty and cold  roast pheasant--goodly sights to a hungry man. Placing these down on a  convenient shelf he fell to with right good will. So Little John ate and  drank as much as he would.    Now the Sheriff had in his kitchen a cook, a stout man and bold, who  heard the rumpus and came in to see how the land lay. There sat Little  John eating away for dear life, while the fat steward was rolled under  the table like a bundle of rags.    \"I make my vow!\" said the cook, \"you are a shrewd hind to dwell thus in  a household, and ask thus to dine.\" So saying he laid aside his spit and  drew a good sword that hung at his side.    \"I make my vow!\" said Little John, \"you are a bold man and hardy to come  thus between me and my meat. So defend yourself and see that you prove  the better man.\" And he drew his own sword and crossed weapons with the  cook.    Then back and forth they clashed with sullen sound. The old ballad which  tells of their fight says that they thought nothing for to flee, but  stiffly for to stand. There they fought sore together, two miles away  and more, but neither might the other harm for the space of a full hour.    \"I make my vow!\" cried Little John, \"you are the best swordsman that  ever yet I saw. What say you to resting a space and eating and drinking  good health with me. Then we may fall to again with the swords.\"    \"Agreed!\" said the cook, who loved good fare as well as a good fight;  and they both laid by their swords and fell to the food with hearty  will. The venison pasty soon disappeared, and the roast pheasant flew  at as lively a rate as ever the bird itself had sped. Then the warriors  rested a space and patted their stomachs, and smiled across at  each other like bosom friends; for a man when he as dined looks out  pleasantly upon the world.    \"And now good Reynold Greenleaf,\" said the cook, \"we may as well settle  this brave fight we have in hand.\"    \"A true saying,\" rejoined the other, \"but first tell me, friend--for  I protest you are my friend henceforth--what is the score we have to  settle?\"    \"Naught save who can handle the sword best,\" said the cook. \"By my troth  I had thought to carve you like a capon ere now.\"    \"And I had long since thought to shave your ears,\" replied Little John.  \"This bout we can settle in right good time. But just now I and my  master have need of you, and you can turn your stout blade to better  service than that of the Sheriff.\"    \"Whose service would that be?\" asked the cook.    \"Mine,\" answered a would-be butcher entering the room, \"and I am Robin  Hood.\"          CHAPTER V    HOW THE SHERIFF LOST THREE GOOD SERVANTS AND FOUND THEM AGAIN         \"Make good cheer,\" said Robin Hood.       \"Sheriff! for charity!       And for the love of Little John       Thy life is granted thee!\"    The cook gasped in amazement. This Robin Hood! and under the Sheriff's  very roof!    \"Now by my troth you are a brave fellow,\" he said. \"I have heard great  tales of your prowess, and the half has not been told. But who might  this tall slasher be?\"    \"Men do call me Little John, good fellow.\"    \"Then Little John, or Reynold Greenleaf, I like you well, on my honor as  Much the miller's son; and you too, bold Robin Hood. An you take me, I  will enter your service right gladly.\"    \"Spoken like a stout man!\" said Robin, seizing him by the hand. \"But I  must back to my own bed, lest some sleepy warden stumble upon me, and  I be forced to run him through. Lucky for you twain that wine flowed  so freely in the house to-day; else the noise of your combat would have  brought other onlookers besides Robin Hood. Now if ye would flee the  house to-night, I will join you in the good greenwood to-morrow.\"    \"But, good master,\" said the cook, \"you would not stay here over night!  Verily, it is running your head into a noose. Come with us. The Sheriff  has set strict watch on all the gates, since 'tis Fair week, but I know  the warden at the west gate and could bring us through safely. To-morrow  you will be stayed.\" \"Nay, that will I not,\" laughed Robin, \"for I shall  go through with no less escort than the Sheriff himself. Now do you,  Little John, and do you, Much the miller's son, go right speedily. In  the borders of the wood you will find my merry men. Tell them to kill  two fine harts against to-morrow eve, for we shall have great company  and lordly sport.\"    And Robin left them as suddenly as he had come.    \"Comrade,\" then said Little John, \"we may as well bid the Sheriff's roof  farewell. But ere we go, it would seem a true pity to fail to take such  of the Sheriff's silver plate as will cause us to remember him, and also  grace our special feasts.\"    \"'Tis well said indeed,\" quoth the cook.    Thereupon they got a great sack and filled it with silver plate from the  shelves where it would not at once be missed, and they swung the sack  between them, and away they went, out of the house, out of the town, and  into the friendly shelter of Sherwood Forest.    The next morning the servants were late astir in the Sheriff's house.  The steward awoke from a heavy sleep, but his cracked head was still in  such a whirl that he could not have sworn whether the Sheriff had ever  owned so much as one silver dish. So the theft went undiscovered for the  nonce.    Robin Hood met the Sheriff at breakfast, when his host soon spoke of  what was uppermost in his heart--the purchase of the fine herd of cattle  near Gamewell. 'Twas clear that a vision of them, purchased for twenty  paltry gold pieces, had been with him all through the night, in his  dreams. And Robin again appeared such a silly fellow that the Sheriff  saw no need of dissembling, but said that he was ready to start at once  to look at the herd.    Accordingly they set forth, Robin in his little butcher's cart, behind  the lean mare, and the Sheriff mounted on a horse. Out of Nottingham  town, through gates open wide, they proceeded, and took the hill road  leading through Sherwood Forest. And as they went on and plunged deeper  among the trees, Robin whistled blithely and sang snatches of tunes.    \"Why are you so gay, fellow?\" said the Sheriff, for, sooth to say, the  silence of the woods was making him uneasy.    \"I am whistling to keep my courage up,\" replied Robin.    \"What is there to fear, when you have the Sheriff of Nottingham beside  you?\" quoth the other pompously.    Robin scratched his head.    \"They do say that Robin Hood and his men care little for the Sheriff,\"  he said.    \"Pooh!\" said the Sheriff. \"I would not give _that_ for their lives, if  I could once lay hands upon them.\" And he snapped his fingers angrily.  \"But Robin Hood himself was on this very road the last time I came to  town,\" said the other.    The Sheriff started at the crackling of a twig under his horse's feet,  and looked around.    \"Did you see him?\" he asked.    \"Aye, that did I! He wanted the use of this mare and cart to drive to  Nottingham. He said he would fain turn butcher. But see!\"    As he spoke he came to a turn in the road, and there before them stood a  herd of the King's deer, feeding. Robin pointed to them and continued:    \"There is my herd of cattle, good Master Sheriff! How do you like them?  Are they not fat and fair to see?\"    The Sheriff drew rein quickly. \"Now fellow,\" quoth he, \"I would I were  well out of this forest, for I care not to see such herds as these, or  such faces as yours. Choose your own way, therefore, whoever you be, and  let me go mine.\"    \"Nay,\" laughed Robin, seizing the Sheriff's bridle, \"I have been at too  much pains to cultivate your company to forego it now so easily. Besides  I wish you to meet some of my friends and dine with me, since you have  so lately entertained me at your board.\"    So saying he clapped a horn on his lips and winded three merry notes.  The deer bounded away; and before the last of them was seen, there came  a running and a rustling, and out from behind covert and tree came full  twoscore of men, clad in Lincoln green, and bearing good yew bows in  their hands and short swords at their sides. Up they ran to Robin Hood  and doffed their caps to him respectfully, while the Sheriff sat still  from very amazement.    \"Welcome to the greenwood!\" said one of the leaders, bending the knee  with mock reverence before the Sheriff.    The Sheriff glared. It was Little John.    \"Woe the worth, Reynold Greenleaf,\" he said, \"you have betrayed me!\"    \"I make my vow,\" said Little John, \"that you are to blame, master. I was  misserved of my dinner, when I was at your house. But we shall set you  down to a feast we hope you will enjoy.\"    \"Well spoken, Little John,\" said Robin Hood. \"Take you his bridle and  let us do honor to the guest who has come to feast with us.\"    Then turning abruptly the whole company plunged into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#7)"],[1," came upon a buried treasure?  What Cyril said was, 'Oh, bother--I've burnt my fingers!' and as he  spoke he dropped the match. 'AND IT WAS THE LAST!' he added.    There was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry.    'Don't,' said Anthea, 'don't, Pussy--you'll exhaust the air if you cry.  We can get out all right.'    'Yes,' said Jane, through her sobs, 'and find the Phoenix has come back  and gone away again--because it thought we'd gone home some other way,  and--Oh, I WISH we hadn't come.'    Every one stood quite still--only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and  tried to wipe her eyes in the dark.    'D-DON'T,' said Jane; 'that's my EAR--I'm not crying with my ears.'    'Come, let's get on out,' said Robert; but that was not so easy, for no  one could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficult  to remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, and  then of course it is quite different, even if you don't strike one.    Every one had come to agree with Jane's constant wish--and despair was  making the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floor  seemed to tip up--and a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift  came upon every one. All eyes were closed--one's eyes always are in the  dark, don't you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said  'Earthquakes!' and they all opened their eyes.    They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how light  and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed  after that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, looking  as calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. On  the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yet  sterling worth for the thanks of the children.    'But how DID you do it?' they asked, when every one had thanked the  Phoenix again and again.    'Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.'    'But how DID you know where to find it?'    'I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always know  all about each other--they're so clannish; like the Scots, you know--all  related.'    'But, the carpet can't talk, can it?'    'No.'    'Then how--'    'How did I get the Psammead's address? I tell you I got it from the  carpet.'    'DID it speak then?'    'No,' said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, 'it didn't speak, but I gathered  my information from something in its manner. I was always a singularly  observant bird.'    It was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as the  tea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the golden  treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground  passage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since the  moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match.    'What owls and goats we were!' said Robert. 'Look how we've always  wanted treasure--and now--'    'Never mind,' said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it.  'We'll go back again and get it all, and then we'll give everybody  presents.'    More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what  presents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity had  been satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy  for themselves.    It was Cyril who broke in on Robert's almost too technical account of  the motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school--    'There!' he said. 'Dry up. It's no good. We can't ever go back. We don't  know where it is.'    'Don't YOU know?' Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully.    'Not in the least,' the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret.    'Then we've lost the treasure,' said Cyril. And they had.    'But we've got the carpet and the Phoenix,' said Anthea.    'Excuse me,' said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, 'I do SO  HATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the  carpet?'        CHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK      It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey  on the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you will  know that the next day must have been Sunday.    Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty  day. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the  breakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowers  were chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were always  sausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six days  of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling.    On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of food  that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and there  was an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do  their best to make you happy.    After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been working  hard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, 'Go and  have an hour's rest.' He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough that  cook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said--    'Come along, kiddies; I've got a ripping book from the library, called  The Golden Age, and I'll read it to you.'    Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could  listen quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the  'armchair corner' of daddy's arm, and the others got into a happy heap  on the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet and  knees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settling  down on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back  top shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out and  played with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-room  door. It opened an angry inch, and the cook's voice said, 'Please, m',  may I speak to you a moment?'    Mother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put her  pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them and  sighed.    'As good fish in the sea,' said father, cheerfully, and it was not till  much later that the children understood what he meant.    Mother went out into the passage, which is called 'the hall', where the  umbrella-stand is, and the picture of the 'Monarch of the Glen' in a  yellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp  in the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in the  face, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that  she had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there and  she seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of her  apron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely--    'If you please ma'am, I should wish to leave at my day month.' Mother  leaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking pale  through the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to the  cook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed so  very unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too.    'Why, what's the matter?' mother said.    'It's them children,' the cook replied, and somehow the children all  felt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember having  done anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease a  cook. 'It's them children: there's that there new carpet in their room,  covered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive  knows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It's  not my place, and it's not my intentions, so I don't deceive you, ma'am,  and but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it's not a bad  place, though I says it, and I wouldn't wish to leave, but--'    'I'm very sorry,' said mother, gently. 'I will speak to the children.  And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell me  to-morrow.'    Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn't  mind if she stayed on a bit, just to see.    But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into  thoroughly by father and mother. Jane's candid explanation that the  mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried  treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others  limited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination  'not to do it again'. But father said (and mother agreed with him,  because mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was her  own idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick  mud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly  nonsense--that meant Jane's truthful statement--were not fit to have a  carpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN'T have one for a week!    So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only  comfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in the  cupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trousers  pocket. 'Till Saturday,' said he.    'Never mind,' said Anthea, 'we've got the Phoenix.'    But, as it happened, they hadn't. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found,  and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of  magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life  in Camden Town--and there was the nursery floor all bare boards in  the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness and  yellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible  distinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, to  try to make friends with the children. But the children never would.    The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue  Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb's cough  was worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in his  brougham carriage.    Every one tried to "]]]
