Straggling upon the outskirts were the  thatched huts of natives, picturesque in their primeval savagery,  harmonizing with the background of tropical jungle and accentuating the  squalid hideousness of the white man's pioneer architecture.    The boy, leaning over the rail, was looking far beyond the man-made  town deep into the God-made jungle.  A little shiver of anticipation  tingled his spine, and then, quite without volition, he found himself  gazing into the loving eyes of his mother and the strong face of the  father which mirrored, beneath its masculine strength, a love no less  than the mother's eyes proclaimed.  He felt himself weakening in his  resolve.  Nearby one of the ship's officers was shouting orders to a  flotilla of native boats that was approaching to lighter the  consignment of the steamer's cargo destined for this tiny post.    \"When does the next steamer for England touch here?\" the boy asked.    \"The Emanuel ought to be along most any time now,\" replied the officer.  \"I figgered we'd find her here,\" and he went on with his bellowing  remarks to the dusty horde drawing close to the steamer's side.    The task of lowering the boy's grandmother over the side to a waiting  canoe was rather difficult.  The lad insisted on being always at her  side, and when at last she was safely ensconced in the bottom of the  craft that was to bear them shoreward her grandson dropped catlike  after her.  So interested was he in seeing her comfortably disposed  that he failed to notice the little package that had worked from his  pocket as he assisted in lowering the sling that contained the old  woman over the steamer's side, nor did he notice it even as it slipped  out entirely and dropped into the sea.    Scarcely had the boat containing the boy and the old woman started for  the shore than Condon hailed a canoe upon the other side of the ship,  and after bargaining with its owner finally lowered his baggage and  himself aboard.  Once ashore he kept out of sight of the two-story  atrocity that bore the legend \"Hotel\" to lure unsuspecting wayfarers to  its multitudinous discomforts.  It was quite dark before he ventured to  enter and arrange for accommodations.    In a back room upon the second floor the lad was explaining, not  without considerable difficulty, to his grandmother that he had decided  to return to England upon the next steamer.  He was endeavoring to make  it plain to the old lady that she might remain in Africa if she wished  but that for his part his conscience demanded that he return to his  father and mother, who doubtless were even now suffering untold sorrow  because of his absence; from which it may be assumed that his parents  had not been acquainted with the plans that he and the old lady had  made for their adventure into African wilds.    Having come to a decision the lad felt a sense of relief from the worry  that had haunted him for many sleepless nights.  When he closed his  eyes in sleep it was to dream of a happy reunion with those at home.  And as he dreamed, Fate, cruel and inexorable, crept stealthily upon  him through the dark corridor of the squalid building in which he  slept--Fate in the form of the American crook, Condon.    Cautiously the man approached the door of the lad's room.  There he  crouched listening until assured by the regular breathing of those  within that both slept.  Quietly he inserted a slim, skeleton key in  the lock of the door.  With deft fingers, long accustomed to the silent  manipulation of the bars and bolts that guarded other men's property,  Condon turned the key and the knob simultaneously.  Gentle pressure  upon the door swung it slowly inward upon its hinges.  The man entered  the room, closing the door behind him.  The moon was temporarily  overcast by heavy clouds.  The interior of the apartment was shrouded  in gloom.  Condon groped his way toward the bed.  In the far corner of  the room something moved--moved with a silent stealthiness which  transcended even the trained silence of the burglar.  Condon heard  nothing.  His attention was riveted upon the bed in which he thought to  find a young boy and his helpless, invalid grandmother.    The American sought only the bank roll.  If he could possess himself of  this without detection, well and good; but were he to meet resistance  he was prepared for that too.  The lad's clothes lay across a chair  beside the bed.  The American's fingers felt swiftly through them--the  pockets contained no roll of crisp, new notes.  Doubtless they were  beneath the pillows of the bed.  He stepped closer toward the sleeper;  his hand was already half way beneath the pillow when the thick cloud  that had obscured the moon rolled aside and the room was flooded with  light.  At the same instant the boy opened his eyes and looked straight  into those of Condon.  The man was suddenly conscious that the boy was  alone in the bed.  Then he clutched for his victim's throat.  As the  lad rose to meet him Condon heard a low growl at his back, then he felt  his wrists seized by the boy, and realized that beneath those tapering,  white fingers played muscles of steel.    He felt other hands at his throat, rough hairy hands that reached over  his shoulders from behind.  He cast a terrified glance backward, and  the hairs of his head stiffened at the sight his eyes revealed, for  grasping him from the rear was a huge, man-like ape.  The bared  fighting fangs of the anthropoid were close to his throat.  The lad  pinioned his wrists.  Neither uttered a sound.  Where was the  grandmother?  Condon's eyes swept the room in a single all-inclusive  glance.  His eyes bulged in horror at the realization of the truth  which that glance revealed.  In the power of what creatures of hideous  mystery had he placed himself!  Frantically he fought to beat off the  lad that he might turn upon the fearsome thing at his back.  Freeing  one hand he struck a savage blow at the lad's face.  His act seemed to  unloose a thousand devils in the hairy creature clinging to his throat.  Condon heard a low and savage snarl.  It was the last thing that the  American ever heard in this life.  Then he was dragged backward upon  the floor, a heavy body fell upon him, powerful teeth fastened  themselves in his jugular, his head whirled in the sudden blackness  which rims eternity--a moment later the ape rose from his prostrate  form; but Condon did not know--he was quite dead.    The lad, horrified, sprang from the bed to lean over the body of the  man.  He knew that Akut had killed in his defense, as he had killed  Michael Sabrov; but here, in savage Africa, far from home and friends  what would they do to him and his faithful ape?  The lad knew that the  penalty of murder was death.  He even knew that an accomplice might  suffer the death penalty with the principal.  Who was there who would  plead for them?  All would be against them.  It was little more than a  half-civilized community, and the chances were that they would drag  Akut and him forth in the morning and hang them both to the nearest  tree--he had read of such things being done in America, and Africa was  worse even and wilder than the great West of his mother's native land.  Yes, they would both be hanged in the morning!    Was there no escape?  He thought in silence for a few moments, and  then, with an exclamation of relief, he struck his palms together and  turned toward his clothing upon the chair.  Money would do anything!  Money would save him and Akut!  He felt for the bank roll in the pocket  in which he had been accustomed to carry it.  It was not there!  Slowly  at first and at last frantically he searched through the remaining  pockets of his clothing.  Then he dropped upon his hands and knees and  examined the floor.  Lighting the lamp he moved the bed to one side  and, inch by inch, he felt over the entire floor.  Beside the body of  Condon he hesitated, but at last he nerved himself to touch it.  Rolling it over he sought beneath it for the money.  Nor was it there.  He guessed that Condon had entered their room to rob; but he did not  believe that the man had had time to possess himself of the money;  however, as it was nowhere else, it must be upon the body of the dead  man.  Again and again he went over the room, only to return each time  to the corpse; but no where could he find the money.    He was half-frantic with despair.  What were they to do?  In the  morning they would be discovered and killed.  For all his inherited  size and strength he was, after all, only a little boy--a frightened,  homesick little boy--reasoning faultily from the meager experience of  childhood.  He could think of but a single glaring fact--they had  killed a fellow man, and they were among savage strangers, thirsting  for the blood of the first victim whom fate cast into their clutches.  This much he had gleaned from penny-dreadfuls.    And they must have money!    Again he approached the corpse.  This time resolutely.  The ape  squatted in a corner watching his young companion.  The youth commenced  to remove the American's clothing piece by piece, and, piece by piece,  he examined each garment minutely.  Even to the shoes he searched with  painstaking care, and when the last article had been removed and  scrutinized he dropped back upon the bed with dilated eyes that saw  nothing in the present--only a grim tableau of the future in which two  forms swung silently from the limb of a great tree.    How long he sat thus he did not know; but finally he was aroused by a  noise coming from the floor below.  Springing quickly to his feet he  blew out the lamp, and crossing the floor silently locked the door.  Then he turned toward the ape, his mind made up.    Last evening he had been determined to start for home at the first  opportunity, to beg the forgiveness of his parents for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#7)"],[1,"scuffle  behind him and a feeble voice bleating for help. Looking round, there  was the old dame down upon the roadway, with her red whimple flying on  the breeze, while the two rogues, black and white, stooped over her,  wresting away from her the penny and such other poor trifles as were  worth the taking. At the sight of her thin limbs struggling in weak  resistance, such a glow of fierce anger passed over Alleyne as set his  head in a whirl. Dropping his scrip, he bounded over the stream once  more, and made for the two villains, with his staff whirled over his  shoulder and his gray eyes blazing with fury.    The robbers, however, were not disposed to leave their victim until they  had worked their wicked will upon her. The black man, with the woman's  crimson scarf tied round his swarthy head, stood forward in the centre  of the path, with a long dull-colored knife in his hand, while the  other, waving a ragged cudgel, cursed at Alleyne and dared him to  come on. His blood was fairly aflame, however, and he needed no such  challenge. Dashing at the black man, he smote at him with such good will  that the other let his knife tinkle into the roadway, and hopped howling  to a safer distance. The second rogue, however, made of sterner stuff,  rushed in upon the clerk, and clipped him round the waist with a grip  like a bear, shouting the while to his comrade to come round and stab  him in the back. At this the negro took heart of grace, and picking up  his dagger again he came stealing with prowling step and murderous eye,  while the two swayed backwards and forwards, staggering this way and  that. In the very midst of the scuffle, however, whilst Alleyne braced  himself to feel the cold blade between his shoulders, there came a  sudden scurry of hoofs, and the black man yelled with terror and ran  for his life through the heather. The man with the birth-mark, too,  struggled to break away, and Alleyne heard his teeth chatter and felt  his limbs grow limp to his hand. At this sign of coming aid the clerk  held on the tighter, and at last was able to pin his man down and  glanced behind him to see where all the noise was coming from.    Down the slanting road there was riding a big, burly man, clad in a  tunic of purple velvet and driving a great black horse as hard as  it could gallop. He leaned well over its neck as he rode, and made a  heaving with his shoulders at every bound as though he were lifting the  steed instead of it carrying him. In the rapid glance Alleyne saw that  he had white doeskin gloves, a curling white feather in his flat velvet  cap, and a broad gold, embroidered baldric across his bosom. Behind him  rode six others, two and two, clad in sober brown jerkins, with the  long yellow staves of their bows thrusting out from behind their right  shoulders. Down the hill they thundered, over the brook and up to the  scene of the contest.    \"Here is one!\" said the leader, springing down from his reeking horse,  and seizing the white rogue by the edge of his jerkin. \"This is one of  them. I know him by that devil's touch upon his brow. Where are your  cords, Peterkin? So! Bind him hand and foot. His last hour has come. And  you, young man, who may you be?\"    \"I am a clerk, sir, travelling from Beaulieu.\"    \"A clerk!\" cried the other. \"Art from Oxenford or from Cambridge? Hast  thou a letter from the chancellor of thy college giving thee a permit  to beg? Let me see thy letter.\" He had a stern, square face, with bushy  side whiskers and a very questioning eye.    \"I am from Beaulieu Abbey, and I have no need to beg,\" said Alleyne, who  was all of a tremble now that the ruffle was over.    \"The better for thee,\" the other answered. \"Dost know who I am?\"    \"No, sir, I do not.\"    \"I am the law!\"--nodding his head solemnly. \"I am the law of England  and the mouthpiece of his most gracious and royal majesty, Edward the  Third.\"    Alleyne louted low to the King's representative. \"Truly you came in good  time, honored sir,\" said he. \"A moment later and they would have slain  me.\"    \"But there should be another one,\" cried the man in the purple coat.  \"There should be a black man. A shipman with St. Anthony's fire, and a  black man who had served him as cook--those are the pair that we are in  chase of.\"    \"The black man fled over to that side,\" said Alleyne, pointing towards  the barrow.    \"He could not have gone far, sir bailiff,\" cried one of the archers,  unslinging his bow. \"He is in hiding somewhere, for he knew well, black  paynim as he is, that our horses' four legs could outstrip his two.\"    \"Then we shall have him,\" said the other. \"It shall never be said,  whilst I am bailiff of Southampton, that any waster, riever, draw-latch  or murtherer came scathless away from me and my posse. Leave that rogue  lying. Now stretch out in line, my merry ones, with arrow on string, and  I shall show you such sport as only the King can give. You on the left,  Howett, and Thomas of Redbridge upon the right. So! Beat high and low  among the heather, and a pot of wine to the lucky marksman.\"    As it chanced, however, the searchers had not far to seek. The negro had  burrowed down into his hiding-place upon the barrow, where he might have  lain snug enough, had it not been for the red gear upon his head. As  he raised himself to look over the bracken at his enemies, the staring  color caught the eye of the bailiff, who broke into a long screeching  whoop and spurred forward sword in hand. Seeing himself discovered,  the man rushed out from his hiding-place, and bounded at the top of  his speed down the line of archers, keeping a good hundred paces to the  front of them. The two who were on either side of Alleyne bent their  bows as calmly as though they were shooting at the popinjay at the  village fair.    \"Seven yards windage, Hal,\" said one, whose hair was streaked with gray.    \"Five,\" replied the other, letting loose his string. Alleyne gave a gulp  in his throat, for the yellow streak seemed to pass through the man; but  he still ran forward.    \"Seven, you jack-fool,\" growled the first speaker, and his bow twanged  like a harp-string. The black man sprang high up into the air, and  shot out both his arms and his legs, coming down all a-sprawl among  the heather. \"Right under the blade bone!\" quoth the archer, sauntering  forward for his arrow.    \"The old hound is the best when all is said,\" quoth the bailiff of  Southampton, as they made back for the roadway. \"That means a quart of  the best malmsey in Southampton this very night, Matthew Atwood. Art  sure that he is dead?\"    \"Dead as Pontius Pilate, worshipful sir.\"    \"It is well. Now, as to the other knave. There are trees and to spare  over yonder, but we have scarce leisure to make for them. Draw thy  sword, Thomas of Redbridge, and hew me his head from his shoulders.\"    \"A boon, gracious sir, a boon!\" cried the condemned man.    \"What then?\" asked the bailiff.    \"I will confess to my crime. It was indeed I and the black cook, both  from the ship 'La Rose de Gloire,' of Southampton, who did set upon the  Flanders merchant and rob him of his spicery and his mercery, for which,  as we well know, you hold a warrant against us.\"    \"There is little merit in this confession,\" quoth the bailiff sternly.  \"Thou hast done evil within my bailiwick, and must die.\"    \"But, sir,\" urged Alleyne, who was white to the lips at these bloody  doings, \"he hath not yet come to trial.\"    \"Young clerk,\" said the bailiff, \"you speak of that of which you know  nothing. It is true that he hath not come to trial, but the trial hath  come to him. He hath fled the law and is beyond its pale. Touch not that  which is no concern of thine. But what is this boon, rogue, which you  would crave?\"    \"I have in my shoe, most worshipful sir, a strip of wood which belonged  once to the bark wherein the blessed Paul was dashed up against the  island of Melita. I bought it for two rose nobles from a shipman who  came from the Levant. The boon I crave is that you will place it in my  hands and let me die still grasping it. In this manner, not only shall  my own eternal salvation be secured, but thine also, for I shall never  cease to intercede for thee.\"    At the command of the bailiff they plucked off the fellow's shoe, and  there sure enough at the side of the instep, wrapped in a piece of fine  sendall, lay a long, dark splinter of wood. The archers doffed caps at  the sight of it, and the bailiff crossed himself devoutly as he handed  it to the robber.    \"If it should chance,\" he said, \"that through the surpassing merits of  the blessed Paul your sin-stained soul should gain a way into paradise,  I trust that you will not forget that intercession which you have  promised. Bear in mind too, that it is Herward the bailiff for whom you  pray, and not Herward the sheriff, who is my uncle's son. Now, Thomas, I  pray you dispatch, for we have a long ride before us and sun has already  set.\"    Alleyne gazed upon the scene--the portly velvet-clad official, the knot  of hard-faced archers with their hands to the bridles of their horses,  the thief with his arms trussed back and his doublet turned down upon  his shoulders. By the side of the track the old dame was standing,  fastening her red whimple once more round her head. Even as he looked  one of the archers drew his sword with a sharp whirr of steel and stept  up to the lost man. The clerk hurried away in horror; but, ere he  had gone many paces, he heard a sudden, sullen thump, with a choking,  whistling sound at the end of it. A minute later the bailiff and four  of his men rode past him on their journey back to Southampton, the other  two having been chosen as grave-diggers. As they passed Alleyne saw that  one of the men was wiping his sword-blade upon the mane of his horse.  A deadly sickness came over him at the sight, and sitting down by the  wayside he burst out weeping, with his nerves all in a jangle. It"]]]
