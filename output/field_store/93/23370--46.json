BIRDS POISONING THEIR YOUNG.      Mr. Holmes, in his \"Account of the United States of America,\" relates  that some of the birds of North America are remarkable for poisoning  their young; but this is only done if they are encaged or confined.  The _robin_ is one of the birds thus noticed. If the young be taken,  and placed in a cage where the parent birds can discover them, they  will attend upon and feed them for a season; but after the lapse of a  few days, or when the young are fledged, the old ones appear very  uneasy, and endeavour to discover some way by which they may escape.  If, however, they perceive that there is no hope of accomplishing  their purpose, they procure for them a sort of berry, which is an  infallible poison; _apparently disdaining the thought that their  offspring should be slaves_!           *       *       *       *       *      A CONNOISSEUR.      Vernet relates, that he was once employed to paint a landscape, with a  cave, and St. Jerome in it; he accordingly painted the landscape, with  St. Jerome at the entrance of the cave. When he delivered the picture,  the purchaser, who understood nothing of perspective, said, \"the  landscape and the cave are well made, but St. Jerome is not _in_ the  cave.\"--\"I understand you, sir,\" replied Vernet, \"I will alter it.\" He  therefore took the painting, and made the shade darker, so that the  saint seemed to sit farther in. The gentleman took the painting; but  it again appeared to him that the saint was not in the cave. Vernet  then wiped out the figure, and gave it to the gentleman, who seemed  perfectly satisfied. Whenever he saw strangers to whom he showed the  picture, he said, \"Here you see a picture by Vernet, with St. Jerome  in the cave.\" \"But we cannot see the saint,\" replied the visiters.  \"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" answered the possessor, \"he is there; for I  have seen him standing at the entrance, and afterwards farther back;  and am therefore quite sure that he is in it.\"           *       *       *       *       *      BLACK MAN'S DREAM.      A number of years bygone, a black man, named Peter Cooper, happened to  marry a fair lady of Greenock, who did not use him with that  tenderness that he conceived himself entitled to. Having tried all  other arts to retrieve her lost affections in vain, Peter at last  resolved to work upon her fears of punishment in another world for her  conduct in this. Pretending, therefore, to awake one morning  extravagantly alarmed, his helpmate was full of anxiety to know what  was the matter; and having sufficiently, as he thought, whetted her  curiosity, by mysteriously hinting that \"he could a tale unfold,\" at  length Peter proceeded as follows:--\"H--ll of a dream last night. I  dream I go to Hebben and rap at de doa, and a gent'man came to de doa  wid black coat and powda hair. Whoa dere? Peeta Coopa.--Whoa Peeta  Coopa? Am not know you--Not knowa Peeta Coopa!

Den I say, Oh! lad, oh!  look de black book; he take de black book, and he look de black book,  and he finda Peeta Coopa wife fust page,--'Peeta-Coopa-wife,  buckra-woman, bad-to-her-husband.'\"           *       *       *       *       *      MAGICAL CLOCK.      Droz, a Genevian mechanic, once constructed a clock which was capable  of the following surprising movements:--There were seen on it a negro,  a dog, and a shepherd; when the clock struck, the shepherd played six  tunes on his flute, and the dog approached and fawned upon him. This  clock was exhibited to the King of Spain, who was delighted with it.  \"The gentleness of my dog,\" said Droz, \"is his least merit; if your  Majesty touch one of the apples, which you see in the shepherd's  basket, you will admire the fidelity of this animal.\" The King took an  apple, and the dog flew at his hand, and barked so loud, that the  King's dog, which was in the room, began also to bark; at this the  Courtiers, not doubting that it was an affair of witchcraft, hastily  left the room, crossing themselves as they went out. The minister of  Marine was the only one that ventured to stay. The king having desired  him to ask the negro what o'clock it was, the minister obeyed, but he  obtained no reply. Droz then observed, that the negro had not yet  learned Spanish.           *       *       *       *       *    _Printed and Published by J.

The rails weigh 9 lb., 14 lb., 19 lb., and 24  lb. per running yard, and are very similar to the rails used on the main  railways of France, except that their base has a proportionally greater  width. As to the strength of the rail, it is much greater in proportion  to the load than would at first sight be thought; all narrow-gauge  railways being formed on the principle of distributing the load over a  large number of axles, and so reducing the amount on each wheel. For  instance, the 9 lb. rail used for the portable railway easily bears a  weight of half a ton for each pair of wheels.    The distance between the rails differs according to the purpose for  which they are intended. The most usual gauges are 16in., 20 in., and  24in. The line of 16 in. gauge, with 9 lb. rails, although extremely  light, is used very successfully in farming, and in the interior of  workshops.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5.]    A length of 16 ft. 5 in. of 9 lb. steel rail, to 16 in. gauge, with  sleepers, etc., scarcely weighs more than 1 cwt., and may therefore be  readily carried by a man placing himself in the middle and taking a rail  in each hand.    Those members of the Institution who recently visited the new port of  Antwerp will recollect having seen there the portable railway which  Messrs. Couvreux and Hersetit had in use; and as it was these works at  the port of Antwerp that gave rise to the idea of this paper, it will be  well to begin with a description of this style of contractor's plant.    The earth in such works may be shifted by hand, horsepower, or  locomotive. For small works the railway of 16 in. gauge, with the 9 lb.  rails, is commonly used, and the trucks carry double equilibrium  tipping-boxes, containing 9 to 11 cubic feet. These wagons, having  tipping-boxes without any mechanical appliances, are very serviceable;  since the box, having neither door nor hinge, is not liable to need  repairs.    This box keeps perfectly in equilibrium upon the most broken up roads.  To tip it up to the right or the left, it must simply be pushed from the  opposite side, and the contents are at once emptied clean out. In order  that the bodies of the wagons may not touch at the top, when several are  coupled together, each end of the wagon is furnished with a buffer,  composed of a flat iron bar cranked, and furnished with a hanging hook.    Plant of this description is now being used in an important English  undertaking at the port of Newhaven, where it is employed not only on  the earthworks, but also for transporting the concrete manufactured with  Mr. Carey's special concrete machine.    These little wagons, of from 9 to 11 cubic feet capacity, run along with  the greatest ease, and a lad could propel one of them with its load for  300 yards at a cost of 3d. per cube yard. In earthworks the saving over  the wheel-barrow is 80 per cent., for the cost of wagons propelled by  hand comes to 0.1d. per cube yard, carried 10 yards, and to go this  distance with a barrow costs 1/2d. A horse draws without difficulty,  walking by the side of the line, a train of from eight to ten trucks on  the level, or five on an incline of 7 per cent. (1 in 14).    One mile of this railway, 16 in. gauge and 9 lb. steel rail, with  sixteen wagons, each having a double equilibrium tipping box containing  11 cubic feet, and all accessories, represents a weight of 20 tons--a  very light weight, if it is considered that all the materials are  entirely of metal. Its net cost price per mile is 450_l_., the wagons  included.    Large contracts for earthwork with horse haulage are carried on to the  greatest advantage with the railway of 20 in. gauge and 14 lb. rails.  The length of 16 ft. 5 in. of this railway weighs 170 lb., and so can  easily be carried by two men, one placing himself at each end. The  wagons most in use for these works are those with double equilibrium  tipping boxes, holding 18 cubic feet. These are at present employed in  one of the greatest undertakings of the age, namely, the cutting of the  Panama Canal, where there are used upward of 2,700 such wagons, and more  than 35 miles of track.    A mile of these rails of 20 in. gauge with 14 lb. rails, together with  sixteen wagons of 18 cubic feet capacity, with appurtenances, costs  about 660_1_., and represents a total weight of 33 tons.    This description of material is used for all contracts exceeding 20,000  cubic yards.    A very curious and interesting use of the narrow-gauge line, and the  wagons with double equilibrium tipping-box, was made by the Societe des  Chemins de Fer Sous-Marins on the proposed tunnel between France and  England. The line used is that of 16 in. gauge, with 9 lb. rails.    The first level of the tunnel, which was constructed by means of a  special machine by Colonel Beaumont, had only a diameter of 2.13 m. (7  ft.); the tipping boxes have therefore a breadth of only 2 ft., and  contain 71/4 cubic feet. The boxes are perfectly balanced, and are most  easily emptied. The wagons run on two lines, the one being for the  loaded trains, and the other for the empty trains.    The engineers and inspectors, in the discharge of their duties, make use  of the Liliputian carriages. The feet of the travelers go between the  wheels, and are nearly on a level with the rails; nevertheless, they are  tolerably comfortable. They are certainly the smallest carriages for  passengers that have ever been built; and the builder even prophesies  that these will be the first to enter into England through the Channel  Tunnel.    One of the most important uses to which a narrow gauge line can be put  is that of a military railway. The Dutch, Russian, and French  Governments have tried it for the transporting of provisions, of war  material, and of the wounded in their recent campaigns. In Sumatra, in  Turkestan, and in Tunis these military railroads have excited much  interest, and have so fully established their value that this paper may  confine itself to a short description.    The campaign of the Russians against the Turcomans presented two great  difficulties; these were the questions of crossing districts in which  water was extremely scarce or failed entirely, and of victualing the  expeditionary forces. This latter object was completely effected by  means of 67 miles of railway, 20 in. gauge, 14 lb. steel rails, with 500  carriages for food, water, and passengers. The rails were laid simply on  the sand, so that small locomotives could not be used, and were obliged  to be replaced by Kirghiz horses, which drew with ease from 1,800 lb. to  2,200 lb. weight for 25 miles per day.    In the Tunisian war this railroad of 20 in. gauge, 14 lb. rail, was  replaced by that of two ft. gauge, with 14 lb. and 19 lb. rails. There  were quite as great difficulties as in the Turcoman campaign, and the  country to be crossed was entirely unknown. The observations made before  the war spoke of a flat and sandy country. In reality a more uneven  country could not be imagined; alternating slopes of about 1 in 10  continually succeeded each other; and before reaching Kairouan 71/2 miles  of swamp had to be crossed. Nevertheless the horses harnessed to the  railway carriages did on an average twelve to seventeen times the work  of those working ordinary carriages. In that campaign also, on account  of the steep ascents, the use of locomotives had to be given up. The  track served not only for the conveying of victuals, war material, and  cannon, but also of the wounded; and a large number of the survivors of  this campaign owe their lives to this railway, which supplied the means  of their speedy removal without great suffering from the temporary  hospitals, and of carrying the wounded to places where more care could  be bestowed upon them.    The carriages which did duty in this campaign are wagons with a platform  entirely of metal, resting upon eight wheels. The platform is 13 ft. 1  in. in length, and 3 ft. 11 in. in width. The total length with buffers  is 14 ft. 9 in. This carriage may be at will turned into a goods wagon  or a passenger carriage for sixteen persons, with seats back to back, or  an ambulance wagon for eight wounded persons.    For the transport of cannon the French military engineers have adopted  small trucks. A complete equipage, capable of carrying guns weighing  from 3 to 9 tons, is composed of trucks with two or three axles, each  being fitted with a pivot support, by means of which it is made possible  to turn the trucks, with the heaviest pieces of ordnance, on turntables,  and to push them forward without going off the rails at the curves.    The trucks which have been adopted for the service of the new forts in  Paris are drawn by six men, three of whom are stationed at each end of  the gun, and these are capable of moving with the greatest ease guns  weighing 9 tons.    The narrow-gauge railway was tested during the war in Tunis more than in  any preceding campaign, and the military authorities decided, after  peace had been restored in that country, to continue maintaining the  narrow-gauge railways permanently; this is a satisfactory proof of their  having rendered good service. The line from Sousse to Kairouan is still  open to regular traffic. In January, 1883, an express was established,  which leaves Sousse every morning and arrives at Kairouan--a distance of  forty miles--in five hours, by means of regularly organized relays. The  number of carriages and trucks for the transport of passengers and goods  is 118.    The success thus attained by the narrow-gauge line goes far to prove how  unfounded is the judgment pronounced by those who hold that light  railways will never suffice for continuous traffic. These opinions are  based on certain cases in the colonies, where it was thought fit to  adopt a light rail weighing about 18 lb. to 27 lb. per"]]]
