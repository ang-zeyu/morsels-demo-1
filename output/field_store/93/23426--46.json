Because of its use among the ancient Romans, as the emblem of peace,  joy, and victory. In the Christian sense, it may be applied to the  victory gained over the powers of darkness by the coming of  Christ.--_Bourne._    Why is the mistletoe so called?    Because its seeds are said to be dropped by the mistle-thrush, which  feeds on its berries.    Why was the mistletoe held sacred by the Druids?    Because they had an extraordinary reverence for the number _three_,  and not only the berries, but the leaves of the mistletoe, grow in  clusters of three united on one stalk. Its growing upon the oak, their  sacred tree, was doubtless another cause of its veneration.    We read of a celebrated oak at Norwood near London, which bore  mistletoe, \"which some people cut for the gain of selling it to the  apothecaries of London, leaving a branch of it to sprout out; but they  proved unfortunate after it, for one of them fell lame, and others lost  an eye. At length, in the year 1678, a certain man, notwithstanding he  was warned against it, upon the account of what the others had suffered,  adventured to cut the tree down, and he soon after broke his  leg.\"--_Camden_.    Mr. Brand, however, thinks that mistletoe was never put up in churches  but by mistake or ignorance of the sextons: it being a heathenish and  profane plant, and therefore assigned to the kitchen. Mr. Brand made  many diligent inquiries after the truth of this point. He learnt at Bath  that it never came into churches there. An old Sexton at Teddington told  him that mistletoe was once put up in the church there, but was by the  clergyman immediately ordered to be taken away.    Why was the boar's head formerly a prime dish at Christmas?    Because fresh meats were then seldom eaten, and brawn was considered a  great delicacy. Holinshed says, that \"in the year 1170, upon the day  of the young prince's coronation, King Henry I. served his sonne at  table as server, bringing up the boar's head with trumpets before it,  according to the manner.\" For this ceremony there was a special carol.  Dugdale also tells us, that \"at the inns of court, during Christmas, the  usual dish at the first course at dinner was a large _bore's head_,  upon a silver platter, with minstralsaye.\" In one of the carols we read  that the boar's head is \"the rarest dish in all the londe, and that it  has been provided in honour of the king of bliss.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE RIVER SCHELDT.      In all former times, and centuries before the labour of Napoleon had  added so immensely to its importance, the Scheldt had been the centre  of the most important preparations for the invasion of England, and the  spot on which military genius always fixed from whence to prepare a  descent on this island. An immense expedition, rendered futile by the  weakness and vacillation of the French monarch, was assembled in it in  the fourteenth century; and sixty thousand men on the shore of the  Scheldt awaited only the signal of Charles VI. to set sail for the shore  of Kent. The greatest naval victory ever gained by the English arms was  that at Sluys, 1340, when Philip of France lost 30,000 men and 230  ships of war in an engagement off the Flemish coast with Edward III.,  a triumph greater, though less noticed in history, than either that  of Cressy or Poictiers. When the great Duke of Parma was commissioned  by Philip II. of Spain to take steps for the invasion of England, he  assembled the forces of the Low Countries at Antwerp; and the Spanish  armada, had it proved successful, was to have wafted over that great  commander from the banks of the Scheldt to the opposite shore of Essex,  at the head of the veterans who had been trained in the Dutch war. In  an evil hour, Charles II., bought by French gold and seduced by French  mistresses, entered into alliance with Louis XIV. for the coercion of  Holland; the Lillies and the Leopards, the navies of France and England,  assembled together at Spithead, and made sail for the French coast,  while the armies of the Grande Monarque advanced across the Rhine into  the heart of the United Provinces; and the consequence was, such a  prodigious addition to the power of France, as it took all the blood and  treasure expended in the war of the Succession and all the victories of  Marlborough, to reduce to a scale at all commensurate with the  independence of the other European states.           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.           *       *       *       *       *      Fleurus is a village in France, in the department of the Sombre and  Meuse, where the Austrians and the French fought a battle in the year  1794, in which the former were defeated. This victory is ascribed to the  information obtained in consequence of reconnoitering the army of the  enemy by the elevation of a balloon. The balloon employed on this  occasion was called the _Entreprenent_; and it was under the  direction of M. Coutel, the captain of the aeronauts at Meudon,  accompanied by an adjutant and a general. He ascended twice in the same  day, to the height of 220 fathoms, for the purpose of observing the  position and manoeuvres of the enemy. He continued each time four hours  in the air, and corresponded with General Jourdan, who commanded the  French army, by means of pre-concerted signals. The enterprise was  discovered by the enemy; and a battery opened its fire against the  ascending aeronauts, but they soon gained an elevation which was beyond  the reach of their fire. This balloon was prepared under the direction  of the Aerostatic Institute, for the use of the army of the north; as  were also another, called _Celeste_, for the army of the Sombre and  Meuse; and the _Hercule_ and _Intrepide_, for the army of the  Rhine and Moselle. Another, thirty feet in circumference, and weighing  160 lbs., was destined for the army of Italy. A new machine, invented by  M. Coutel, the director of the Aerostatic Institute, was designed to aid  the aeronauts in communicating intelligence, and denominated the  _Aerostatic Telegraph_.    P.T.W.      _Muscular Strength_.--It is asserted by travellers, that a Turkish  porter will run along carrying a weight of 600 lbs. Milo, of Crotona,  is said to have lifted an ox, weighing upwards of 1,000 Ibs. Haller  mentions that he saw an instance of a man, whose finger being caught in  a chain at the bottom of a mine, by keeping it forcibly bent, supported  by that means the weight of his whole body, 150 lbs., till he was drawn  up to the surface, a height of 600 feet. Augustus II., king of Poland,  could with his fingers roll up a silver dish like a sheet of paper,  and twist the strongest horse-shoe asunder. An account is given in  the _Philosophical Transactions_, No. 310, of a lion who left the  impression of his teeth upon a solid piece of iron. The most prodigious  power of the muscles is exhibited by fish:--A whale moves with a  velocity through the dense medium of water that would carry him, if  he continued at the same rate, round the world in little more than a  fortnight; and a sword-fish has been known to strike his weapon quite  through the oak plank of a ship.    W.G.C.      _Beauties of Chatsworth_.--Marshal Tallard, who was entertained a  few days at this place by the Duke of Devonshire, on leaving, made this  declaration--\"When I return,\" said he, \"into my own country, and reckon  up the days of my captivity, I shall leave out those which I spent at  Chatsworth.\" And Quin once said that he had nearly broken his neck in  coming to it, and he should break his heart on his return.    SWAINE.      _Origin of the Discovery of Peru_.--Balboa, the famous Spanish  adventurer, in one of his expeditions, met with a young cazique, who  expressed his astonishment at the high value which was set upon the  gold, which the Spaniards were weighing and distributing. \"Why do you  quarrel,\" said he, \"about such a trifle? If you are so passionately fond  of gold as to abandon your own country, and to disturb the tranquillity  of distant nations, for its sake, I will conduct you to a region where  the metal, which seems to be the chief object of your admiration and  desire, is so common, that the meanest utensils are formed of it.\"  Transported with the intelligence, Balboa eagerly inquired where this  happy country lay, and how they might arrive at it. The cazique informed  them, that at the distance of six suns, or six days' journey to the  south, they would discover another ocean, near which this wealthy  kingdom was situated; but if they intended to attack it, they must  assemble forces far superior in number and strength to those which now  attended them.--This was the first information which the Spaniards  received concerning the great southern continent, known afterwards  by the name of Peru.    P.T.W.      _Cholera Morbus._--Dr. James Johnson, in his interesting book  entitled, _Change of Air, or Pursuits of Health_, &c., says--\"The  cholera morbus ought to be denominated the high-police of scavengers.  It has cleared away more filth, in Europe and England, than all the  municipal edicts that ever issued from the constituted authorities.  On this, and on some other accounts, it _will_ save more lives  than it _has_ destroyed.\"      _Patriotism._--When the Chancellor d'Auguesseau, who constantly  resisted the encroachments of Louis XIV. on the liberties of the people,  was sent for to Versailles by that monarch, he was thus encouraged by  his amiable wife: \"Go,\" said she, \"forget in the king's presence your  wife and your children,--sacrifice everything except your honour.\"    SWAINE.

Finally, we believe that a study of Tinguian mythology has shown us  that we can gain a real knowledge of the past of a people through  their folklore; that we can secure an insight into their mental life;  and can learn something of the valuation they attach to certain of  their activities and beliefs, which to us may seem at the surface  trite and trivial.        Tales of the Mythical Period        1    \"We go to take greens, sister-in-law Dinay, perhaps the _siksiklat_  [84] will taste good. I have heard that the _siksiklat_ is good,\"  said Aponibolinayen. They went to get her _siksiklat_. When they  arrived at the place of small trees, which they thought was the  place of the _siksiklat_, they looked. Aponibolinayen was the first  who looked. As soon as she began to break off the _siksiklat_ which  she saw she did not break any more, but the _siksiklat_ encircled  and carried her up. When they reached the sky (literally \"the up\"),  the _siksiklat_ placed her below the _alosip_ [85] tree. She sat for  a long time. Soon she heard the crowing of the rooster. She stood up  and went to see the rooster which crowed. She saw a spring. She saw it  was pretty because its sands were _oday_ [86] and its gravel _pagapat_  [87] and the top of the betel-nut tree was gold, and the place where  the people step was a large Chinese plate which was gold. She was  surprised, for she saw that the house was small. She was afraid and  soon began to climb the betel-nut tree, and she hid herself.    The man who owned the house, which she saw near the well, [88]  was Ini-init--the sun. But he was not in the place of his house,  because he went out and went above to make the sun, because that was  his work in the daytime. And the next day Aponibolinayen saw him,  who went out of his house, because he went again to make the sun. And  Aponibolinayen went after him to his house, because she saw the man,  who owned the house, who left. When she arrived in the house, she  quickly cooked, because she was very hungry.    When she finished cooking, she took the stick used in roasting fish  and cooked it, and the fish-stick which she cooked became cut-up fish,  because she used her magic power. [89] When she finished to cook  the fish, she took out rice from the pot, and when she had finished  to take out the rice from the pot, she took off the meat from the  fish. When she finished taking the fish from the pot, she ate. When  she finished eating, she washed. When she finished washing, she kept  those things which she used to eat, the coconut shell cup and plate,  and she laid down to sleep.    When afternoon came, Ini-init went home to his house after he finished  fishing. He saw his house, which appeared as if it was burning,  not slowly. He went home because it appeared as if his house was  burning. When he arrived at his house, it was not burning, and he was  surprised because it appeared as if there was a flame at the place  of his bed. When he was in his house, he saw that which was like the  flame of the fire, at the place of his bed, was a very pretty lady.    Soon he cooked, and when he had finished to cook he scaled the  fish, and when he had finished scaling he cut it into many pieces,  and he made a noise on the bamboo floor when he cut the fish. The  woman awoke, who was asleep on his bed. She saw that the man who  cut the fish was a handsome man, and that he dragged his hair. [90]  The pot she had used to cook in looked like the egg of a rooster [91]  and he was surprised because it looked like the egg of a rooster; and  the rice which she cooked was one grain of broken rice. [92] Because  of all this Ini-init was surprised, for the pot was very small with  which she cooked. After Ini-init cooked, the woman vanished and she  went to the leaves of the betel-nut, where she went to hide.    After Ini-init finished cooking the fish, he saw the bed, the place  where the woman was sleeping, was empty. He was looking continually,  but he did not find her. When he could not find her, he ate alone,  and when he finished eating he washed, and when he finished washing  the dishes he put away, and when he had finished putting away he went  to the yard to get a fresh breath.    Not long afterwards he went to take a walk in the place of his  betel-nuts. When he had finished to take a walk in the place of his  betel-nuts, he went to sleep.    When it began to be early morning, he left his house, he who went up,  because it was his business to make the sun. And Aponibolinayen went  again into the house.    When it became afternoon, Ini-init went to his home, and Aponibolinayen  had cooked, after which she went out to the betel-nut trees. When  Ini-init arrived, he was surprised because his food was cooked, for  there was no person in his house. As soon as he saw the cooked rice  and cooked fish in the dish, he took the fish and the rice and began  to eat. When he had finished eating, he went to his yard to take  a fresh breath and he was troubled in his mind when he thought of  what had happened. He said, \"Perhaps the woman, which I saw, came to  cook and has left the house. Sometime I shall try to hide and watch,  so that I may catch her.\" He went to sleep, and when it became early  morning he went to cook his food. When he had finished eating, he  went again to make the sun, and Aponibolinayen went again to his house.    When the sun had nearly sunk, he sent the big star who was next to  follow him in the sky, and he went home to spy on the woman. When he  had nearly reached his home, he saw the house appeared as if it was  burning. [93] He walked softly when he went up the ladder. He slammed  shut the door. He reached truly the woman who was cooking in the  house. He went quickly and the woman said to him, \"You cut me only  once, so that I only cure one time, if you are the old enemy.\" \"If  I were the old enemy, I should have cut before,\" said Ini-init,  and he sat near her who cooked. He took out the betel-nut, and he  arranged it so that they began to chew the betel-nut, and he said,  \"Ala! young lady, we are going to chew, because it is bad for us to  talk who do not know each other's names.\" Aponibolinayen answered,  \"No, for if the rich man who practices magic is able to give to the  rich woman who has magical power, soon there will be a sign.\" Ini-init  said, \"No, hurry up even though we are related, for you come here if  we are not related.\" [94]    He begged her and he cut the betel-nut, which was to be chewed, which  was covered with gold, and he gave it to the woman who had magical  power, and they chewed. When she laid down the quid, it looked like  the agate bead, which has no hole for the thread. And the quid of  Ini-init looked like a square bead.    \"My name is Ini-init, who often goes to travel over the world. I  always stop in the afternoon. What can I do, it is my business,\"  he said. Aponibolinayen was next to tell her name. \"My name is  Aponibolinayen, who lives in Kaodanan, who am the sister of Awig,\"  she said, and when they had finished telling their names, both their  quids looked like the agate bead which is _pinoglan_, which has no  hole. Ini-init said, \"We are relatives, and it is good for us to be  married. Do not be afraid even though you did not come here of your  own accord. I go to Kaodanan,\" he said. Then they married, and the  sun went to shine on the world, because it was his business, and the  big star also had business when it became night. Aponibolinayen staid  alone in the house, and in the afternoon the sun again went home, but  first he went to fish in the river. He went home when he had caught  the big fish for them to eat--both those married. And when he arrived  in their house he found Aponibolinayen, who was cooking, and he saw  that she still broke up the fish-stick, which she cooked. Ini-init  asked her, \"What are you doing with that stick which you are  breaking, which you put in the jar?\" and Aponibolinayen replied,  \"I cook for us both to eat,\" and the sun laughed, because she cooked  the stick. \"You throw away that stick which you are cooking; this  fish which I caught with the net is what you are to cook. It is not  eatable that fish-stick which you cook,\" he said. Aponibolinayen said,  \"You shall see by and by, when we eat, what it will become. You hang  up the fish which you caught, which we shall eat to-morrow.\" \"Hurry  up! You throw away that stick which you cook, it has no use. Even  though you cook for one month, it will not become soft, and I do not  think it will become good,\" said Ini-init. Aponibolinayen said, \"No,  you hurry and hang that fish which you caught with the net, because  it is nearly cooked--the rice and the fish.\" Not long after she took  out the rice from the jar, and she uncovered her cooked fish, which  was a stick. When the sun saw that the fish came from the stick which  she cooked, he was surprised and he asked her how she made the stick,  which she cooked, turn to fish. Aponibolinayen said, \"You hurry come  and eat, for I have finished taking out the rice and fish.\" [95]    Not long after that the sun went truly in front of her to the place  of the rice and cooked fish, and they ate.    Not long after they finished and Aponibolinayen washed, and when  she had finished washing she put away those things which they  ate and Ini-init made trouble because of the stick which became  a fish. He again asked Aponibolinayen how she made the stick into  fish, and Aponibolinayen said, \"Do not trouble yourself, perhaps  you know about the rich woman who practices magic in Kaodanan,\"  and Ini-init said, \"Yes, I know the rich woman who practices magic  in Kaodanan, who sometimes has much power, who changes, who has no  equal.\" Aponibolinayen said, \"Why do you still ask if you "]]]
