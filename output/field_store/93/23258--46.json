Very  likely, Arline had assured her, she wouldn't see one of them. That, on the  whole, had been rather discouraging. How was she to show herself a gracious  lady, forsooth, if no one came near her? But she kept these things  jealously tucked away in the remotest corner of her own mind, and managed  to look the relief she did not feel.    And, after all, the _charivari_, as is apt to be the case when the plans  are laid so carefully, proved a very tame affair. Valeria, sitting rather  dismally in the parlor with Mrs. Hawley for company, at midnight heard a  banging of tin cans somewhere outside, a fitful popping of six-shooters,  and an abortive attempt at a procession coming up the street. But the lines  seemed to waver and then break utterly at the first saloon, where drink was  to be had for the asking and Manley Fleetwood was pledged to pay, and the  rattle of cans was all but drowned in the shouts of laughter and talk which  came from the \"office,\" across the hall. For where is the pleasure or the  profit in _charivaring_ a bridal couple which stays up and waits quite  openly for the clamor?    \"Is it always so noisy here at night?\" asked Valeria faintly when Mrs.  Hawley had insisted upon her lying down upon the uncomfortable sofa.    \"Well, no--unless a round-up pulls in, or there's a dance, or it's  Christmas, or something. It's liable to keep up till two or three o'clock,  so the sooner you git used to it, the better off you'll be. I'm going to  leave you here, and go to bed--unless you want to go upstairs yourself.  Only it'll be noisier than ever up in your room, for it's right over the  office, and the way sound travels up is something fierce. Don't you be  afraid--I'll lock this door, and if your husband wants to come in he can  come through the dining room.\" She looked at Valeria and hesitated before  she spoke the next sentence. \"And don't you worry a bit over him, neither.  My old man was in the kitchen a minute ago, when I was out there, and he  says Man ain't drinking a drop to-night. He's keeping as straight as--\"    Valeria sat up suddenly, quite scandalized. \"Oh--why, of course Manley  wouldn't drink with them! Why--who ever heard of such a thing? The idea!\"  She stared reproachfully at her hostess.    \"Oh, sure! I didn't say such a thing was liable to happen. I just thought  you might be--worrying--they're making so much racket in there,\" stammered  Arline.    \"Indeed, no. I'm not at all worried, thank you. And please don't let me  keep you up any longer, Mrs. Hawley. I am quite comfortable--mentally and  physically, I assure you. Good night.\"    Not even Mrs. Hawley could remain after that. She went out and closed the  door carefully behind her, without even finding voice enough to return  Valeria's sweetly modulated good night.    \"She's got a whole lot to learn,\" she relieved her feelings somewhat by  muttering as she mounted the stairs.    What it cost Manley Fleetwood to abstain absolutely and without even the  compromise of \"soft\" drinks that night, who can say? Three years of free  living in Montana had lowered his standard of morality without giving him  that rugged strength of mind which makes a man master of himself first of  all. He had that day lain, drunken and sleeping, when he should have been  at his mental and physical best to meet the girl who would marry him. It  was that very defection, perhaps, which kept him sober in the midst of his  taunting fellows. Now that Valeria was actually here, and was his wife, he  was possessed by the desire to make some sacrifice by which he might prove  his penitence. At any cost he would spare her pain and humiliation, he told  himself.    He did it, and he did it under difficulty. He was denied the moral support  of Kent Burnett, for Kent was sulking over his slight, and would have  nothing to say to him. He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his  crowd. He was \"baptized\" by some drunken reveler, so that the stench of  spilled whisky filled his nostrils and tortured him the night through.  He was urged, he was bullied, he was ridiculed. His head throbbed, his  eyeballs burned. But through it all he stayed among them because he feared  that if he left them and went to Val, some drunken fool might follow him  and shock her with his inebriety. He stayed, and he stayed sober. Val was  his wife. She trusted him, and she was ignorant of his sins. If he went to  her staggering and babbling incoherent foolishness, he knew it would break  her heart.    When the sky was at last showing faint dawn tints and the clamor had worn  itself out perforce--because even the leaders were, after all, but men, and  there was a limit to their endurance--Manley entered the parlor, haggard  enough, it is true, and bearing with him the stale odor of cigars long  since smoked, and of the baptism of bad whisky, but also with the air  of conscious rectitude which sits so comically upon a man unused to the  feeling of virtue.    As is so often the case when one fights alone the good fight and manages to  win, he was chagrined to find himself immediately put upon the defensive.  Val, as she speedily demonstrated, declined to look upon him as a hero, or  as being particularly virtuous. She considered herself rather neglected and  abused. She believed that he had stayed away because he was angry with her  on account of her refusal to leave town, and she thought that was rather  brutal of him. Also, her head ached from tears and lack of sleep, and she  hated the town, the hotel--almost she hated Manley himself.    Manley felt the rebuff of her chilling silence when he came in, and when  she twitched herself loose from his embrace he came near regretting his  extreme virtue. He spent ten minutes trying to explain, without telling all  of the truth, and he felt his good opinion of himself slipping from him  before her inexorable disfavor.    \"Well, I don't blame you for not liking the town, Val,\" he said at last,  rather desperately. \"But you mustn't judge the whole country by it. You'll  like the ranch, dear. You'll feel as if you were in another world--\"    \"I hope so,\" Val interrupted quellingly.    \"We'll drive out there just as soon as we have breakfast.\" He laid his hand  diffidently upon her tumbled hair. \"I _had_ to stay out there with those  fellows. I didn't want to--\"    \"I don't want any breakfast,\" said Val, getting up and going over to the  window--it would seem to avoid his caress. \"The odor of that dining room is  enough to make one fast forever.\" She lifted the grimy lace curtain with  her finger tips and looked disconsolately out upon the street. \"It's just a  dirty, squalid little hamlet. I don't suppose the streets have been  cleaned or the garbage removed from the back yards since the place was  first--founded.\" She laughed shortly at the idea of \"founding\" a wretched  village like that, but she had no other word at hand.    \"_Arline_,\" she remarked, in a tone of drawling recklessness. \"Arline  swears. Did you know it? I suppose, of course, you do. She said something  that struck me as being shockingly true. She said I'm 'sure having a hell  of a honeymoon.'\" Then she bit her lips hard, because her eyelids were  stinging with the tears she refused to shed in his presence.    \"Oh, Val!\" From the sofa Manley stared contritely at her back. She must  feel terrible, he thought, to bring herself to repeat that sentence--Val,  so icily pure in her thoughts and her speech.    Val was blinking her tawny eyes--like the eyes of a lion in color--at the  street. Not for the world would she let him see that she wanted to cry! A  figure, blurred to indistinctness, appealed in a doorway nearly opposite,  stood for a moment looking up at the reddened sky, and came across the  street. As the tears were beaten back she saw and recognized him, with a  curl of the lip.    \"Here comes your cowboy friend--from a saloon, of course.\" Her voice  was lazily contemptuous. \"Only his presence in the street was needed to  complete the picture of desolation. He has been in a fight, judging from  his face. It is all bruised and skinned, and one eye is swollen--ugh! My  guide, my adviser--is it possible, Manley, that you couldn't find a _nice_  man to meet me at the train?\" She turned from the disagreeable sight of  Kent and faced her husband. \"Are all the men like that? And are all the  women like--Arline?\"    Manley looked at her dumbly from the sofa. Would Val ever come to  understand the place, and the people, he was wondering.    She laughed suddenly. \"I'm beginning to feel very sorry for Walt,\" she said  irrelevantly, pointing to the easel and the expressionless crayon portrait  staring out from the gilt frame. \"He has to stay in this room always. And  I believe another two hours would drive me hopelessly insane.\" The word  caught her attention. \"Hope!\" she laughed ironically. \"What imbecile ever  thought of hope in the same breath with this place? What they really ought  to do is paint that 'Abandon-hope' admonition across the whole front of the  depot!\"    Manley, because he had lifted his head too suddenly and so sent white-hot  irons of pain clashing through his brain, turned sullen. \"If you hate it as  bad as all that,\" he said, \"why, there'll be a train for the East in about  two hours.\"    Val stiffened perceptibly, though the petulance in her face changed to  something wistful. \"Do you mean--do you want me to go?\" she asked very  calmly.    Manley pressed his fingers hard against his temples. \"You know I don't. I  want you to stay and like the country, and be happy. But--the way you have  been talking makes it seem--a-ah!\" He dropped his tortured head upon his  hands and did not trouble to finish what he had intended to say. Nervous  strain, lack of sleep, and a headache to begin with, were taking heavy toll  of him. He could not argue with her; he could not do anything except "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#7)"],[1,"more men-servants, the more robbery; the more _Torah_, the more  life (20); the more schooling, the more wisdom; the more counsel, the  more understanding; the more charity, the more peace.  He who has  acquired a good name has acquired it for himself; he who has acquired  for himself words of _Torah_ has acquired for himself life in the  world to come\" (21).          (10) The chain of traditional sayings is continued here from        chapter I, 14, with other maxims of Hillel.  See        _Introduction_, p. 17.          (11) _I.e._, share its weal and woe.  Cf. _Taanit_, 11a, \"He        who does not join the community in times of danger and trouble        will never enjoy the divine blessing.\"          (12) One should constantly be on guard against oneself.  The        _Talmud_ (_Berachot_, 29a) illustrates this saying by        referring to a certain Jochanan, who, after having been        high-priest for eighty years, became a heretic.          (13) This verse may be variously translated and interpreted.        Its translation here is in accordance with the interpretation        of Maimonides.  Do not express yourself in such a way that        your words may be understood only after careful study and deep        thought, but let them be clear and intelligible.          (14) The word [bur (bet-vov-resh)] means \"uncultivated\"        ([sadeh bur] \"an uncultivated field\").  It is used of an        ignorant, uncultured, mannerless person, possessing no moral        or spiritual virtues.  Taylor translates it by \"boor.\"  [am        ha'aretz], literally \"people of the land,\" \"country people,\"        is applied to an individual who may possess good manners, and        may be literate, but who has no religious knowledge, nor        training, nor does not observe religious customs.  Taylor        renders it \"vulgar.\"  Mayer Sulzberger maintains that this        term was applied to an assembly of representatives of the        people constituting a body similar to the modern Parliament,        and divided into a lower and upper house.  See his \"_The Am        Ha-aretz, The Ancient Hebrew Parliament._\"  On the _Am        ha-aretz_ and his opposite the _chaber_, see Schurer,        _History_, II, ii, pp. 8, 9 and pp. 22 _et seq._, also        Herford, _ibid._ pp. 46-47.          (15) _I.e._, he who is ashamed to ask questions for fear of        exposing his ignorance.          (16) He who has no patience to answer all the questions of his        pupils.          (17) Cf. chapter IV, 12.  One of the qualifications necessary        for the acquirement of the _Torah_ is moderation in business.          (18) Do not boldly push yourself forward; but where there is        no one to fill the position of teacher or leader, or to be the        head of the community, and you have the qualifications, do not        shrink from being the man.          (19) Retribution is sure.  Cf. _Sanhedrin_, 100a and _Sotah_,        9b, \"with what measure a man measures, is it measured unto        him.\"          (20) Cf. Prov. III, 1 and 2.          (21) The expression \"the world to come\" may mean the Messianic        days, the time after the Messianic era, the days after the        resurrection or the spiritual hereafter.  Maimonides discusses        at length the various theories, in _Perek Chelek_ (Commentary        on _Sanhedrin_, X, 1), which has been translated into English        by J. Abelson, in the _Jewish Quarterly Review_ (London), vol.        XXIX, p. 28 _et seq._  See also _The Hebrew Review_ (London,        1840), p. 254 _et seq._  Consult Schurer, _History_, II, ii,        92.    9. Rabban Jochanan, the son of Zakkai (22) received (the tradition)  from Hillel and Shammai.  He used to say, \"If thou hast learnt much  _Torah_, ascribe not any merit to thyself, for thereunto wast thou  created.\"          (22) Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was known as the least of the        disciples of Hillel.  He was a contemporary of the historian        Josephus.  Escaping in a coffin from Jerusalem, when it was        besieged by the Roman general Vespasian, and predicting the        latter's elevation to the imperial dignity, Jochanan was        allowed by Vespasian to go to Jabneh (Jamnia), where he        founded the celebrated academy which became the centre of        learning in Palestine, as Jerusalem had previously been.  He        was the most important scribe in the first decade after the        destruction of the Temple (70 C.E.).  See Strack, _Einleitung        in den Talmud_, p. 86 _et seq._, Bacher, _Agada der Tanaiten_,        pp. 25-46, Myers, _Story of the Jewish People_, I, pp.        151-160, and Danziger, _Jewish Forerunners of Christianity_,        pp. 55-72.    10. Rabban Jochanan, the son of Zakkai, had five disciples (23), and  these are they: Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus; Rabbi Joshua, the  son of Hananiah (24); Rabbi Jose, the Priest; Rabbi Simeon, the son of  Nataniel; and Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Arach.  11. He used thus to  recount their praise: \"Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, is a cemented  cistern, which loses not a drop (25); Joshua, the son of Hananiah,  happy is she that bare him (26); Jose, the Priest, is a pious man  (27); Simeon, the son of Nataniel, is a fearer of sin; Eleazar, the  son of Arach, is like a spring flowing with ever-sustained vigor\"  (28).  12. He used to say, \"If all the sages of Israel were in one  scale of the balance, and Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, in the other,  he would outweigh them all.\"  Abba Saul (29) said in his name, \"If all  the sages of Israel were in one scale of the balance, and Eliezer, the  son of Hyrcanus, also with them, and Eleazar, the son of Arach, in the  other scale, he would outweigh them all.\"  13. He said to them, \"Go  forth and see which is the good way to which a man should cleave.\"  R.  Eliezer said, \"A good eye\" (30); R. Joshua said, \"A good friend\"; R.  Jose said, \"A good neighbor\" (31); R. Simeon said, \"One who foresees  the fruit of an action\" (32); R. Eleazar said, \"A good heart.\"  Thereupon he said to them, \"I approve of the words of Eleazar, the son  of Arach, rather than your words, for in his words yours are included\"  (33).  14. He said to them, \"Go forth and see which is the evil way  that a man should shun.\"  R. Eliezer said, \"An evil eye\" (34); R.  Joshua said, \"A bad friend\"; R. Jose said, \"A bad neighbor\"; R. Simeon  said, \"One who borrows and does not repay--it is the same whether one  borrows from man or the Omnipresent (35); as it is said, 'The wicked  borroweth and payeth not again, but the righteous dealeth graciously  and giveth'\" (36); R. Eleazar said, \"A bad heart.\"  Thereupon he said  to them, \"I approve of the words of Eleazar, the son of Arach, rather  then your words, for in his words yours are included.\"          (23) Of special excellence.          (24) On the life of R. Joshua (40-130 C.E.), see Bacher,        _ibid._, 129-194, Myers, _ibid._, 161-170, Danziger, _ibid._,        122-151.          (25) He forgets nothing he has learned.  On R. Eliezer, see        Danziger, _ibid._, 91-121.          (26) When yet a child in the cradle, his mother took him into        the synagogue that he might thus early hear the words of the        _Torah_.          (27) A _chasid_ ([chasid]), \"saint,\" is one who does more than        the strict letter of the law requires.  See Schechter,        _Studies_, II, pp. 148-181, _idem_, _Aspects_, p. 209, Rawicz,        _Commentar des Maimonides_, pp. 95-96, and Gorfinkle, _The        Eight Chapters_, pp. 60-62.          (28) \"A welling spring\" (Taylor).          (29) He lived in the first half of the second century, C.E.          (30) _I.e._, an eye that looks upon people with benevolence        and kind feelings, free from envy and ill-will.          (31) A good friend is one who induces his associate to study        _Torah_, and who reproves him when he sees him doing wrong.        The passage means not so much to gain a good friend as to _be_        a good friend.          (32) One who balances the present against the future.          (33) The heart was considered the seat of all moral and        spiritual functions.  See Schechter, _Aspects_, p. 255 _et        seq._          (34) Denotes niggardliness, envy, or jealousy.          (35) _I.e._, one who lacks foresight and incurs        responsibilities he is unable to meet borrows from God, as all        wealth belongs to Him, and men are merely His stewards.  The        word [makom], literally \"place,\" \"space,\" was used to        designate Jerusalem, or the Temple, as being _the_ place where        God's spirit dwells; or it may also refer to the divine court        of the _Sanhedrin_.  It then came to be used as an appellative        for God.  As Schechter remarks, \"The term is mainly indicative        of God's ubiquity in the world and can best be translated by        'Omnipresent.'\"  See Hoffmann, _Sanhedrin_ VI, note 56,        Taylor, _Sayings_, p. 53, note 42, and Schechter, _Aspects_,        pp. 26-27, where the literature on this subject is given.  See        also Friedlander, _The Jewish Religion_, p. 287, and the        Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Names of God_.          (36) Psalm XXXVII, 21.    15. They each said three things.  R. Eliezer said, \"Let thy friend's  honor be as dear to thee as thine own (37); be not easily excited to  anger; and repent one day before thy death\" (38).  And (he further  said), \"Warm thyself by the fire of the wise, but beware of their  glowing coals, lest thou be burnt, for their bite is the bite of the  fox, and their sting is the scorpion's sting, and their hiss is the  serpent's hiss, and all their words are like coals of fire\" (39).  16.  R. Joshua said, \"The evil eye, the evil inclination (40), and hatred  of his fellow-creatures (41), put a man out of the world.\"  17. R.  Jose said, \"Let the property of thy friend be as dear to thee as thine  own; prepare thyself for the study of _Torah_, since"]]]
