The sign originally  appears to have been a bell hung within a hoop, a common mode of  representation in former times. This origin has been proved by a grant in  the reign of Henry VI. in which John French, gentleman of London, gives to  Joan French, widow, his mother, \"all that tenement or inn called Savage's  Inn, otherwise called the Bell on the Hoop.\" In the original \"vocat\"  Savagesynne, alias vocat \"Le Belle on the Hope.\" Perhaps the phrase  \"Cock-a-Hoop,\" may be derived from the sign of that bird standing on a  hoop, thus most conspicuously displaying himself, as we find that sign or  rather design existed in the reign above mentioned.           *       *       *       *       *        PARISH FEASTING.      A dinner always accompanies meetings on public occasions; feasting was  formerly attached in like manner to chantries, anniversaries, &c.; and, as  it appears in part of the curious items in the parish books of Darlington,  clergymen officiated for a donation of wine. It appears, too, that both  ministers and parishioners were saddled with charitable aids to itinerants  of various kinds; that noblemen granted passes in the manner of briefs;  and that it was deemed right and proper for even churchwardens and  overseers to patronize knowledge. Accordingly we have,    \"1630. To Mr. Goodwine, a distressed scholer, 2s. 6d.\"    \"1631. Given to a poor scholler, 12d.--Given to Mary Rigby, of Hauret West,  in Pembrokeshire, in Wales, who had the Earle of Pembroke's passe.... To  an Irish gentleman that had fouer children, and had Earl Marshall's passe,  12d.\"    \"1635. To a souldier which came to the church on a Sunday, 6d.\"    \"1639. For Mr. Thompson, that preached the forenoone and afternoone, for a  quart of sack, 14d.\"    \"1650. For six quartes of sacke to the ministre that preached, when we had  not a ministere, 9s.\"    It is to be observed that this was in the _puritanical era_.    \"1653. For a primer for a poore boy, 4d.\"    \"1666. For one quarte of sacke, bestowed on Mr. Jellet, when he preached,  2s. 4d.\"    \"1684. To the parson's order, given to a man both deaf and dumb, being  sent from minister to minister to London, 6d.--To Mr. Bell, with a letter  from London with the names of the Royal Family, 6d.\"    This is a curious item; for it shows that the Mercuries, diurnals, and  intelligencers of the day, were not deemed sufficient for satisfactorily  advertising public events.    \"1688. To the ringers on Thanksgiving Day, for the young Prince, in money,  ale, and coals, 7s. 4d.\"    This must have been for the birth of  the Pretender, of warming-pan celebrity.    \"1691. For a pint of brandy, when Mr. George Bell preached here, 1s.  4d.--When the Dean of Durham preached here, spent in a treat with him,  3s. 6d.--For a stranger that preacht, a dozen of ale, 1s.\"    Thus it plainly appears that church-wardens had a feast jointly with the  minister at the parish expense, at least whenever a stranger preached.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER      \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"    SHAKSPEAKE.           *       *       *       *       *    STATIONERY LETTER.    ( _For the Mirror_.)        TO MR. ----, STATIONER, HOLBORN.      SIR,--Sometime ago I wrote to you to send me a _ream_ of _foolscap_,    which I begged might be sent without delay, as it was for the purpose of    writing out my Christmas bills. I think you must have forgotten me; and    if I do not have the _paper_ soon, I may wear a _fool's-cap_ on account    of not having my bills out in time. Mr. ----, who, in your absence, must    sustain the greatest weight of business, and is, as I may say, the    _Atlas_ of your house, was the person I chiefly depended on. As for    Mr. ----, one of your household, he dresses in _royal purple_, and being    but in a _medium_ way between sickness and health, was drinking    _imperial_ when I saw him, and therefore did not in-_quire_ about the    business; nor did I choose to come _cap_ in _hand_ to a gentleman that    seemed as stately as an _elephant_, though to my thinking he is a    _bundle_ of conceit, all _outside_ show; in short, a piece of    _lumberhand_, on whom I would not _waste paper_ to write him a _note_.      My journeyman, who is but a _demy_ sort of a chap, will make but a    _small hand_ of the bills, and I shall go to _pott_. You also will be a    sufferer, if you _post_-pone sending my _paper_, for you shall have    neither _plate paper_,[1] nor a _single crown_, no, nor a _cartridge_ of    halfpence from me this half year, unless you play your _cards_ better. I    have more bills to write out than a _bag cap_, made of the largest    _grand eagle_ you have in your warehouse, could contain; so that I shall    look as _blue_ as your _sugar_-paper, and bestow on you to boot some    very ugly prayers, not in _single hand_, but by _thick_ and _thin    couples_, that will be a _fine copy_ for my young man to take example by,    if you disappoint.      Your humble servant, J. J.        [1] Bank notes.           *       *       *       *       *      RUSTIC SIMPLICITY.      A village pastor was examining his parishioners in their Catechism. The  first question in the Heidelberg Catechism is this: \"What is thy only  consolation in life and in death?\" A young girl, to whom the pastor put  this question, laughed, and would not answer. The priest insisted. \"Well,  then,\" said she, at length, \"if I must tell you, it is the young shoemaker,  who lives in the Rue Agneaux.\"           *       *       *       *       *      TALL PEOPLE.      The king of France, being at Calais, sent over an embassador, a verie tall  person, upon no other errand but a complement to the king of England. At  his audience he appeared in such a light garb, that afterwards the king  ask'd Lord-keeper Bacon \"what he thought of the French embassador?\" He  answer'd, \"That he was a verie proper man.\"--\"I,\" his majestie replied,  \"but what think you of his head-piece? is he a proper man for the office,  of an embassador?\"--\"Sir,\" returned he, \"it appears too often, _that tall  men are like high houses of four or five stories, wherein commonlie the  upper-most room is worst-furnished_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The following anecdote is perfectly indicative of that dry humour which  forms what Oxonians call a _cool hand_:--When Mr. Gurney, afterwards  rector of Edgefield, in Norfolk, held a fellowship of Bene't, the master  had a desire to get possession of the fellows' garden for himself. The  rest of the fellows, resigned their keys, but Gurney resisted both his  threats and entreaties, and refused to part with his key. \"The other  fellows,\" said the master, \"have delivered up their keys.\"--\"Then, master,\"  said Gurney, \"pray keep them, and you and I will keep all the other  fellows out.\"--\"Sir,\" continued the master, \"am not I your  master?\"--\"Granted,\" said Gurney, \"but am I not your fellow?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Louis XIV. was such a gourmand, that he would eat at a sitting four  platesful of different soups, a whole pheasant, a partridge, a plateful  of salad, mutton hashed with garlick, two good sized slices of ham, a dish  of pastry, and, afterwards, fruit and sweetmeats. The descendant Bourbons  are slandered for having appetites of considerable action; but this  appears to have been one of a four or five man power.           *       *       *       *       *      A FLASH CARD.

It is this latter that renders the shrub so very  conspicuous when in full flower. Unfortunately, the Benthamia is not  hardy throughout the country, the south and west of England, especially  Cornwall, and the southern parts of Ireland being the favoured spots  where this handsome shrub or small growing tree--for in Cornwall it has  attained to fully 45 feet in height, and in Cork nearly 30 feet--may be  found in a really thriving condition. Around London it does well enough  for a time, but with severe frost it gets cut back to the ground, and  though it quickly recovers and grows rapidly afterwards, before it is  large enough to flower freely it usually suffers again. The fruits are  as large and resemble Strawberries, and of a rich scarlet or reddish  hue, and though ripe in October they frequently remain on the trees  throughout the winter. Both for its flowers and fruit, this Nepaul  shrub-tree is well worthy of a great amount of trouble to get it  established in a cosy corner of the garden. Rich, well-drained loam is  all it wants, while propagation by seed is readily effected.    C. FLORIDA, the Florida Dogwood, is not always very satisfactory when  grown in this country, our climate in some way or other being  unsuitable for its perfect development. It is a handsome shrub or  small-growing tree, with small flowers surrounded by a large and  conspicuous white involucre. The leaves are ovate-oblong, and pubescent  on the undersides. It is a valuable as well as ornamental little tree,  and is worthy of a great amount of coddling and coaxing to get it  established.    C. KOUSA (_syn Benthamia japonica_).--Japan. This is a very distinct  and beautiful flowering shrub. Flowers very small individually, but  borne in large clusters, and yellow, the showy part being the four  large, pure white bracts which subtend each cluster of blossoms, much  like those in Cornus florida, only the bracts are more pointed than  those of the latter species. Being quite hardy, and a plant of great  interest and beauty, this little known Cornus is sure to be widely  planted when better known.    C. MACROPHYLLA (_syn C. brachypoda_).--Himalayas, China and Japan,  1827. This is an exceedingly handsome species, of tabulated appearance,  occasioned by the branches being arranged almost horizontally. The  leaves are of large size, elliptic-ovate, and are remarkable for their  autumnal tints. The elder-like flowers appear in June. They are pure  white and arranged in large cymes. C. macrophylla variegata is a  distinct and very ornamental form of the above, in which the leaf  margins are bordered with white.    C. MAS.--Cornelian Cherry. Austria, 1596. One of our earliest flowering  trees, the clusters of yellow blooms being produced in mild seasons by  the middle of February. It is not at all fastidious about soil,  thriving well in that of very opposite description. It deserves to be  extensively cultivated, if only for the profusion of brightly-tinted  flowers, which completely cover the shoots before the leaves have  appeared. C. Mas aurea-elegantissima, the tricolor-leaved Dogwood, is a  strikingly ornamental shrub, with green leaves encircled with a golden  band, the whole being suffused with a faint pinky tinge. It is of more  slender growth than the species, and a very desirable acquisition to  any collection of hardy ornamental shrubs. C. Mas argenteo-variegata is  another pretty shrub, the leaves being margined with clear white.    C. NUTTALLII grows to fully 50 feet in height, and is one of the most  beautiful of the Oregon and Californian forest trees. The flower bracts  are of large size, often 6 inches across, the individual bracts being  broad and white, and fully 2-1/2 inches long.    C. OFFICINALIS is a Japanese species, that is, however, quite hardy in  this country, and nearly resembles the better known C. Mas, but from  which it may at once be known by the tufts of brownish hairs that are  present in the axils of the principal leaf veins.    C. STOLONIFERA.--Red Osier Dogwood. North America, 1741. This has  rather inconspicuous flowers, that are succeeded by whitish fruit, and  is of greatest value for the ruddy tint of the young shoots. It grows  fully 6 feet high, and increases rapidly by underground suckers. The  species is quite hardy.    C. TARTARICA (_syn C. siberica_).--Siberia, 1824. This has much  brighter coloured bark, and is of neater and dwarfer habit, than the  typical C. alba. It is a very beautiful and valuable shrub, of which  there is a variegated leaved form.      COROKIA.    COROKIA COTONEASTER.--New Zealand, 1876. A curious, dwarf-growing  shrub, with small, bright yellow, starry flowers produced in June. The  hardiness of the shrub is rather doubtful.      CORONILLA.    CORONILLA EMERUS.--Scorpion Senna. France, 1596. This shrub, a native  of the middle and southern parts of Europe, forms an elegant loose bush  about 5 feet high, with smooth, pinnate, sub-evergreen leaves, and  Pea-shaped flowers, that are reddish in the bud state, but bright  yellow when fully expanded. It is an elegant plant, and on account of  its bearing hard cutting back, is well suited for ornamental hedge  formation; but however used the effect is good, the distinct foliage  and showy flowers making it a general favourite with planters. It will  thrive in very poor soil, but prefers a light rich loam.      CORYLOPSIS.    CORYLOPSIS HIMALAYANA.--E. Himalayas, 1879. This is a stronger growing  species than C. pauciflora and C. spicata, with large leaves averaging  4 inches long, that are light green above and silky on the under sides.  The parallel veins of the leaves are very pronounced, while the  leaf-stalks, as indeed the young twigs too, are covered with a hairy  pubescence.    C. PAUCIFLORA is readily distinguished from the former by its more  slender growth, smaller leaves, and fewer flowered spikes. Flowers  primrose-yellow.    C. SPICATA.--Japan, 1864. This Japanese shrub is of very distinct  appearance, having leaves like those of our common Hazel, and drooping  spikes of showy-yellowish, fragrant flowers that are produced before  the leaves. There is a variegated form in cultivation.    The various species of Corylopsis are very ornamental garden plants,  and to be recommended, on account of their early flowering, for  prominent positions in the shrubbery or by the woodland walk. Light,  rich loam seems to suit them well.      CORYLUS.    CORYLUS AVELLANA PURPUREA.--Purple Hazel. This has large leaves of a  rich purple colour, resembling those of the purple Beech, and is a very  distinct plant for the shrubbery border. Should be cut down annually if  large leaves are desired.    C. COLURNA.--Constantinople Hazel. Turkey, 1665. This is the largest  and most ornamental of the family, and is mentioned here on account of  the showy catkins with which the tree is usually well supplied. When  thickly produced, as they usually are on established specimens, these  long catkins have a most effective and pleasing appearance, and tend to  render the tree one of the most distinct in cultivation. Under  favourable circumstances, such as when growing in a sweet and rather  rich brown loam, it attains to fully 60 feet in height, and of a neat  shape, from the branches being arranged horizontally, or nearly so.  Even in a young state the Constantinople Hazel is readily distinguished  from the common English species, by the softer and more angular leaves,  and by the whitish bark which comes off in long strips. The stipules,  too, form an unerring guide to its identity, they being long, linear,  and recurved.      COTONEASTER.    COTONEASTER BACILLARIS.--Nepaul, 1841. A large-growing species, and one  of the few members of the family that is more ornamental in flower than  in fruit. It is of bold, portly, upright growth, and sends up shoots  from the base of the plant. The pretty white flowers are borne in  clusters for some distance along the slender shoots, and have a very  effective and pleasing appearance; indeed, the upper portion of the  plant has the appearance of a mass of white blossoms.    C. FRIGIDA.--Nepaul, 1824. The species forms a large shrub or low tree  with oblong, elliptical, sub-evergreen leaves. The flowers are white  and borne in large corymbs, which are followed by scarlet berries in  September.    C. MICROPHYLLA.--Small-leaved Cotoneaster. Nepaul, 1825. This is, from  a flowering point of view, probably the most useful of any member of  this rather large genus. Its numerous pretty white flowers, dark,  almost Yew-green leaves, and abundance of the showiest red berries in  winter, will ever make this dwarf, clambering plant a favourite with  those who are at all interested in beautiful shrubs. All, or nearly  all, the species of Cotoneaster are remarkable and highly valued for  their showy berries, but, except the above, and perhaps C. buxifolia  (Box-leaved Cotoneaster), few others are worthy of consideration from a  purely flowering point of view.    C. SIMONSII.--Khasia, 1868. The stems of this species usually grow from  4 feet to 6 feet high, with sub-erect habit. The leaves are  roundly-elliptic and slightly silky beneath. The small flowers are  succeeded by a profusion of scarlet berries that ripen in autumn. This  is generally considered the best for garden purposes.      CRATAEGUS.    CRATAEGUS AZAROLUS.--South Europe, 1640. This is a very  vigorous-growing species, with a wide, spreading head of rather  upright-growing branches. The flowers are showy and the fruit large and  of a pleasing red colour.    C. AZAROLUS ARONIA (_syn C. Aronia_).--Aronia Thorn. South Europe,  1810. This tree attains to a height of 20 feet, has deeply lobed leaves  that are wedge-shaped at the base, and slightly pubescent on the under  sides. The flowers, which usually are at their best in June, are white  and showy, and succeeded by"]]]
