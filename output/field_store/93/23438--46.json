I call it a _cherpah_--a shame.\"    \"Yes, but you stole another two pounds,\" said Becky.    \"How do you know?\" said Sugarman startled.    Becky winked and shook her head sapiently. \"Never _you_ mind.\"    The published list of the winning numbers was so complex in construction  that Sugarman had ample opportunities of bewildering his clients.    \"I von't sell you no more tickets,\" said Sugarman with righteous  indignation.    \"A fat lot I care,\" said Becky, tossing her curls.    \"Thou carest for nothing,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, seizing the opportunity  for maternal admonition. \"Thou hast not even brought me my medicine  to-night. Thou wilt find, it on the chest of drawers in the bedroom.\"    Becky shook herself impatiently.    \"I will go,\" said the special young man.    \"No, it is not beautiful that a young man shall go into my bedroom in my  absence,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch blushing.    Becky left the room.    \"Thou knowest,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, addressing herself to the special  young man, \"I suffer greatly from my legs. One is a thick one, and one a  thin one.\"    The young man sighed sympathetically.    \"Whence comes it?\" he asked.    \"Do I know? I was born so. My poor lambkin (this was the way Mrs.  Belcovitch always referred to her dead mother) had well-matched legs. If  I had Aristotle's head I might be able to find out why my legs are  inferior. And so one goes about.\"    The reverence for Aristotle enshrined in Yiddish idiom is probably due  to his being taken by the vulgar for a Jew. At any rate the theory that  Aristotle's philosophy was Jewish was advanced by the mediaeval poet,  Jehuda Halevi, and sustained by Maimonides. The legend runs that when  Alexander went to Palestine, Aristotle was in his train. At Jerusalem  the philosopher had sight of King Solomon's manuscripts, and he  forthwith edited them and put his name to them. But it is noteworthy  that the story was only accepted by those Jewish scholars who adopted  the Aristotelian philosophy, those who rejected it declaring that  Aristotle in his last testament had admitted the inferiority of his  writings to the Mosaic, and had asked that his works should be  destroyed.    When Becky returned with the medicine, Mrs. Belcovitch mentioned that it  was extremely nasty, and offered the young man a taste, whereat he  rejoiced inwardly, knowing he had found favor in the sight of the  parent. Mrs. Belcovitch paid a penny a week to her doctor, in sickness  or health, so that there was a loss on being well. Becky used to fill up  the bottles with water to save herself the trouble of going to fetch the  medicine, but as Mrs. Belcovitch did not know this it made no  difference.    \"Thou livest too much indoors,\" said Mr. Sugarman, in Yiddish.    \"Shall I march about in this weather? Black and slippery, and the Angel  going a-hunting?\"    \"Ah!\" said Mr. Sugarman, relapsing proudly into the vernacular, \"Ve  English valk about in all vedders.\"    Meanwhile Moses Ansell had returned from evening service and sat down,  unquestioningly, by the light of an unexpected candle to his expected  supper of bread and soup, blessing God for both gifts. The rest of the  family had supped. Esther had put the two youngest children to bed  (Rachel had arrived at years of independent undressing), and she and  Solomon were doing home-lessons in copy-books, the candle saving them  from a caning on the morrow. She held her pen clumsily, for several of  her fingers were swathed in bloody rags tied with cobweb. The  grandmother dozed in her chair. Everything was quiet and peaceful,  though the atmosphere was chilly. Moses ate his supper with a great  smacking of the lips and an equivalent enjoyment. When it was over he  sighed deeply, and thanked God in a prayer lasting ten minutes, and  delivered in a rapid, sing-song manner. He then inquired of Solomon  whether he had said his evening prayer. Solomon looked out of the corner  of his eyes at his _Bube_, and, seeing she was asleep on the bed, said  he had, and kicked Esther significantly but hurtfully under the table.    \"Then you had better say your night-prayer.\"    There was no getting out of that; so Solomon finished his sum, writing  the figures of the answer rather faint, in case he should discover from  another boy next morning that they were wrong; then producing a Hebrew  prayer-book from his inky cotton satchel, he made a mumbling sound, with  occasional enthusiastic bursts of audible coherence, for a length of  time proportioned to the number of pages. Then he went to bed. After  that, Esther put her grandmother to bed and curled herself up at her  side. She lay awake a long time, listening to the quaint sounds emitted  by her father in his study of Rashi's commentary on the Book of Job, the  measured drone blending not disagreeably with the far-away sounds of  Pesach Weingott's fiddle.    Pesach's fiddle played the accompaniment to many other people's  thoughts. The respectable master-tailor sat behind his glazed  shirt-front beating time with his foot. His little sickly-looking wife  stood by his side, nodding her bewigged head joyously. To both the music  brought the same recollection--a Polish market-place.    Belcovitch, or rather Kosminski, was the only surviving son of a widow.  It was curious, and suggestive of some grim law of heredity, that his  parents' elder children had died off as rapidly as his own, and that his  life had been preserved by some such expedient as Alte's. Only, in his  case the Rabbi consulted had advised his father to go into the woods and  call his new-born son by the name of the first animal that he saw. This  was why the future sweater was named Bear. To the death of his brothers  and sisters, Bear owed his exemption from military service. He grew up  to be a stalwart, well-set-up young baker, a loss to the Russian army.    Bear went out in the market-place one fine day and saw Chayah in maiden  ringlets. She was a slim, graceful little thing, with nothing obviously  odd about the legs, and was buying onions. Her back was towards him, but  in another moment she turned her head and Bear's. As he caught the  sparkle of her eye, he felt that without her life were worse than the  conscription. Without delay, he made inquiries about the fair young  vision, and finding its respectability unimpeachable, he sent a  _Shadchan_ to propose to her, and they were affianced: Chayah's father  undertaking to give a dowry of two hundred gulden. Unfortunately, he  died suddenly in the attempt to amass them, and Chayah was left an  orphan. The two hundred gulden were nowhere to be found. Tears rained  down both Chayah's cheeks, on the one side for the loss of her father,  on the other for the prospective loss of a husband. The Rabbi was full  of tender sympathy. He bade Bear come to the dead man's chamber. The  venerable white-bearded corpse lay on the bed, swathed in shroud, and  _Talith_ or praying-shawl.    \"Bear,\" he said, \"thou knowest that I saved thy life.\"    \"Nay,\" said Bear, \"indeed, I know not that.\"    \"Yea, of a surety,\" said the Rabbi. \"Thy mother hath not told thee, but  all thy brothers and sisters perished, and, lo! thou alone art  preserved! It was I that called thee a beast.\"    Bear bowed his head in grateful silence.    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi, \"thou didst contract to wed this dead man's  daughter, and he did contract to pay over to thee two hundred gulden.''    \"Truth.\" replied Bear.    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi, \"there are no two hundred gulden.\"    A shadow flitted across Bear's face, but he said nothing.    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi again, \"there are not two gulden.\"    Bear did not move.    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi, \"leave thou my side, and go over to the other  side of the bed, facing me.\"    So Bear left his side and went over to the other side of the bed facing  him.    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi, \"give me thy right hand.\"    The Rabbi stretched his own right hand across the bed, but Bear kept his  obstinately behind his back.    \"Bear,\" repeated the Rabbi, in tones of more penetrating solemnity,  \"give me thy right hand.\"    \"Nay,\" replied Bear, sullenly. \"Wherefore should I give thee my right  hand?\"    \"Because,\" said the Rabbi, and his tones trembled, and it seemed to him  that the dead man's face grew sterner. \"Because I wish thee to swear  across the body of Chayah's father that thou wilt marry her.\"    \"Nay, that I will not,\" said Bear.    \"Will not?\" repeated the Rabbi, his lips growing white with pity.    \"Nay, I will not take any oaths,\" said Bear, hotly. \"I love the maiden,  and I will keep what I have promised. But, by my father's soul, I will  take no oaths!\"    \"Bear,\" said the Rabbi in a choking voice, \"give me thy hand. Nay, not  to swear by, but to grip. Long shalt thou live, and the Most High shall  prepare thy seat in Gan Iden.\"    So the old man and the young clasped hands across the corpse, and the  simple old Rabbi perceived a smile flickering over the face of Chayah's  father. Perhaps it was only a sudden glint of sunshine.    The wedding-day drew nigh, but lo! Chayah was again dissolved in tears.    \"What ails thee?\" said her brother Naphtali.    \"I cannot follow the custom of the maidens,\" wept Chayah. \"Thou knowest  we are blood-poor, and I have not the wherewithal to buy my Bear a  _Talith_ for his wedding-day; nay, not even to make him a _Talith_-bag.  And when our father (the memory of the righteous for a blessing) was  alive, I had dreamed of making my _chosan_ a beautiful velvet satchel  lined with silk, and I would have embroidered his initials thereon in  gold, and sewn him beautiful white corpse-clothes. Perchance he will  rely upon me for his wedding _Talith_, and we shall be shamed in the  sight of the congregation.\"    \"Nay, dry thine eyes, my sister,\" said Naphtali. \"Thou knowest that my  Leah presented me with a costly _Talith_ when I led her under the  canopy. Wherefore, do thou take my praying-shawl and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#8)"],[1,"than a symbol of immortality which  in time became to be believed in as a really existing bird. The fact,  however, that there was supposed to be only one phoenix, and also that  the length of each of its lives coincided with what the ancients  termed a \"great year,\" may indicate that the phoenix was a symbol  of cosmological periodicity. On the other hand, some ancient writers  (e_.g_. TACITUS, A.D. 55-120) explicitly refer to the phoenix as a  symbol of the sun, and in the minds of the ancients the sun was closely  connected with the idea of immortality. Certainly the accounts of  the gorgeous colours of the plumage of the phoenix might well be  descriptions of the rising sun. It appears, moreover, that the Egyptian  hieroglyphic _benu_, {glyph}, which is a figure of a heron or crane (and  thus akin to the phoenix), was employed to designate the rising sun.      (2) See CUVIER'S _The Animal Kingdom_, GRIFFITH'S trans., vol. viii.  (1829), p. 23.      There are some curious Jewish legends to account for the supposed  immortality of the phoenix. According to one, it was the sole animal  that refused to eat of the forbidden tree when tempted by EVE. According  to another, its immortality was conferred on it by NOAH because of its  considerate behaviour in the Ark, the phoenix not clamouring for food  like the other animals.(1)      (1) The existence of such fables as these shows how grossly the real  meanings of the Sacred Writings have been misunderstood.      There is a celebrated bird in Chinese tradition, the _Fung Hwang_, which  some sinologues identify with the phoenix of the West.(2) According to  a commentator on the '_Rh Ya_, this \"felicitous and perfect bird has a  cock's head, a snake's neck, a swallow's beak, a tortoise's back, is of  five different colours and more than six feet high.\"      (2) Mr CHAS. GOULD, B.A., to whose book _Mythical Monsters_ (1886) I am  very largely indebted for my account of this bird, and from which I have  culled extracts from the Chinese, is not of this opinion. Certainly the  fact that we read of Fung Hwangs in the plural, whilst tradition asserts  that there is only one phoenix, seems to point to a difference in  origin.      Another account (that in the _Lun Yu Tseh Shwai Shing_) tells us that  \"its head resembles heaven, its eye the sun, its back the moon,  its wings the wind, its foot the ground, and its tail the woof.\"  Furthermore, \"its mouth contains commands, its heart is conformable to  regulations, its ear is thoroughly acute in hearing, its tongue utters  sincerity, its colour is luminous, its comb resembles uprightness, its  spur is sharp and curved, its voice is sonorous, and its belly is the  treasure of literature.\" Like the dragon, tortoise, and unicorn, it was  considered to be a spiritual creature; but, unlike the Western phoenix,  more than one Fung Hwang was, as I have pointed out, believed to exist.  The birds were not always to be seen, but, according to Chinese records,  they made their appearance during the reigns of certain sovereigns. The  Fung Hwang is regarded by the Chinese as an omen of great happiness and  prosperity, and its likeness is embroidered on the robes of empresses  to ensure success. Probably, if the bird is not to be regarded as purely  mythological and symbolic in origin, we have in the stories of it no  more than exaggerated accounts of some species of pheasant. Japanese  literature contains similar stories.    Of other fabulous bird-forms mention may be made of the _griffin_ and  the _harpy_. The former was a creature half eagle, half lion, popularly  supposed to be the progeny of the union of these two latter. It is  described in the so-called _Voiage and Travaile of Sir_ JOHN MAUNDEVILLE  in the following terms(1): \"Sum men seyn, that thei ben the Body upward,  as an Egle, and benethe as a Lyoun: and treuly thei seyn sothe, that  thei ben of that schapp. But o Griffoun hathe the body more gret and  is more strong thanne 8 Lyouns, of suche Lyouns as ben o this half; and  more gret and strongere, than an 100 Egles, suche as we ben amonges us.  For o Griffoun there will bere, fleynge to his Nest, a gret Hors, or  2 Oxen zoked to gidere, as thei gon at the Plowghe. For he hathe his  Talouns so longe and so large and grete, upon his Feet, as thoughe thei  weren Hornes of grete Oxen or of Bugles or of Kyzn; so that men maken  Cuppes of hem, to drynken of: and of hire Ribbes and of the Pennes of  hire Wenges, men maken Bowes fulle strong, to schote with Arwes  and Quarelle.\" The special characteristic of the griffin was its  watchfulness, its chief function being thought to be that of guarding  secret treasure. This characteristic, no doubt, accounts for its  frequent use in heraldry as a supporter to the arms. It was sacred to  APOLLO, the sun-god, whose chariot was, according to early sculptures,  drawn by griffins. PLINY, who speaks of it as a bird having long ears  and a hooked beak, regarded it as fabulous.      (1) _The Voiage and Travaile of Sir_ JOHN MAUNDEVILLE, _Kt.

The work, which was first published in French  during the latter part of the fourteenth century, achieved an immense  popularity, the marvels that it relates being readily received by the  credulous folk of that and many a succeeding day.      The harpies (_i.e_. snatchers) in Greek mythology are creatures like  vultures as to their bodies, but with the faces of women, and armed with  sharp claws.    \"Of Monsters all, most Monstrous this; no greater Wrath God sends  'mongst Men; it comes from depth of pitchy Hell: And Virgin's Face, but  Womb like Gulf unsatiate hath, Her Hands are griping Claws, her Colour  pale and fell.\"(1)      (1) Quoted from VERGIL by JOHN GUILLIM in his _A Display of Heraldry_  (sixth edition, 1724), p. 271.      We meet with the harpies in the story of PHINEUS, a son of AGENOR,  King of Thrace. At the bidding of his jealous wife, IDAEA, daughter of  DARDANUS, PHINEUS put out the sight of his children by his former wife,  CLEOPATRA, daughter of BOREAS. To punish this cruelty, the gods caused  him to become blind, and the harpies were sent continually to harass  and affright him, and to snatch away his food or defile it by their  presence. They were afterwards driven away by his brothers-in-law,  ZETES and CALAIS. It has been suggested that originally the harpies were  nothing more than personifications of the swift storm-winds; and few  of the old naturalists, credulous as they were, regarded them as real  creatures, though this cannot be said of all. Some other fabulous  bird-forms are to be met with in Greek and Arabian mythologies, _etc_.,  but they are not of any particular interest. And it is time for us to  conclude our present excursion, and to seek for other byways.          V. THE POWDER OF SYMPATHY: A CURIOUS MEDICAL SUPERSTITION    OUT of the superstitions of the past the science of the present has  gradually evolved. In the Middle Ages, what by courtesy we may term  medical science was, as we have seen, little better than a heterogeneous  collection of superstitions, and although various reforms were  instituted with the passing of time, superstition still continued for  long to play a prominent part in medical practice.    One of the most curious of these old medical (or perhaps I should say  surgical) superstitions was that relating to the Powder of Sympathy, a  remedy (?) chiefly remembered in connection with the name of Sir KENELM  DIGBY (1603-1665), though he was probably not the first to employ it.  The Powder itself, which was used as a cure for wounds, was, in fact,  nothing else than common vitriol,(1) though an improved and more elegant  form (if one may so describe it) was composed of vitriol desiccated by  the sun's rays, mixed with _gum tragacanth_. It was in the application  of the Powder that the remedy was peculiar. It was not, as one might  expect, applied to the wound itself, but any article that might have  blood from the wound upon it was either sprinkled with the Powder or  else placed in a basin of water in which the Powder had been dissolved,  and maintained at a temperate heat. Meanwhile, the wound was kept clean  and cool.      (1) Green vitriol, ferrous sulphate heptahydrate, a compound of iron,  sulphur, and oxygen, crystallised with seven molecules of water,  represented by the formula FeSO4<.>7H2O. On exposure to the air it loses  water, and is gradually converted into basic ferric sulphate. For long,  green vitriol was confused with blue vitriol, which generally occurs  as an impurity in crude green vitriol. Blue vitriol is copper sulphate  pentahydrate, CuSO4<.>5H2O.      Sir KENELM DIGBY appears to have delivered a discourse dealing with the  famous Powder before a learned assembly at Montpellier in France; at  least a work purporting to be a translation of such a discourse was  published in 1658,(1) and further editions appeared in 1660 and 1664.  KENELM was a son of the Sir EVERARD DIGBY (1578-1606) who was executed  for his share in the Gunpowder Plot. In spite of this fact, however,  JAMES I. appears to have regarded him with favour. He was a man of  romantic temperament, possessed of charming manners, considerable  learning, and even greater credulity. His contemporaries seem to have  differed in their opinions concerning"]]]
