He imparted that odd writhing movement to his shoulders.    \"For my conduct I am responsible to the Commissioner,\" he replied. \"And  if he's not satisfied the Commissioner can have my written resignation  at any hour in the twenty-four that he's short of a pipe-lighter. If  it would not inconvenience you to keep quiet for two minutes I will  continue my examination of this witness.\"        CHAPTER VII. FURTHER EVIDENCE    The examination of Quentin Gray was three times interrupted by telephone  messages from Vine Street; and to the unsatisfactory character of these  the growing irascibility of Chief Inspector Kerry bore testimony. Then  the divisional surgeon arrived, and Burton incurred the wrath of the  Chief Inspector by deserting his post to show the doctor upstairs.    \"If inspired idiocy can help the law,\" shouted Kerry, \"the man who  did this job is as good as dead!\" He turned his fierce gaze in Gray's  direction. \"Thank you, sir. I need trouble you no further.\"    \"Do you wish me to remain?\"    \"No. Inspector Whiteleaf, see these two gentlemen past the Sergeant on  duty.\"    \"But damn it all!\" cried Gray, his pent-up emotions at last demanding an  outlet, \"I won't submit to your infernal dragooning! Do you realize  that while you're standing here, doing nothing--absolutely nothing--an  unhappy woman is--\"    \"I realize,\" snapped Kerry, showing his teeth in canine fashion, \"that  if you're not outside in ten seconds there's going to be a cloud of dust  on the stairs!\"    White with passion, Gray was on the point of uttering other angry and  provocative words when Seton took his arm in a firm grip. \"Gray!\" he  said sharply. \"You leave with me now or I leave alone.\"    The two walked from the room, followed by Whiteleaf. As they  disappeared:    \"Read out all the times mentioned in the last witness's evidence,\"  directed Kerry, undisturbed by the rencontre.    Sergeant Coombes smiled rather uneasily, consulting his notebook.    \"'At about half-past six I drove to Bond Street,'\" he began.    \"I said the times,\" rapped Kerry. \"I know to what they refer. Just give  me the times as mentioned.\"    \"Oh,\" murmured Coombes, \"Yes. 'About half-past six.'\" He ran his finger  down the page. \"'A quarter to seven.' 'Seven o'clock.' 'Twenty-five  minutes past seven.' 'Eight o'clock.'\"    \"Stop!\" said Kerry. \"That's enough.\" He fixed a baleful glance upon  Gunn, who from a point of the room discreetly distant from the terrible  red man was watching with watery eyes. \"Who's the smart in all the  overcoats?\" he demanded.    \"My name is James Gunn,\" replied this greatly insulted man in a husky  voice.    \"Who are you? What are you? What are you doing here?\"    \"I'm employed by Spinker's Agency, and--\"    \"Oh!\" shouted Kerry, moving his shoulders. He approached the speaker and  glared menacingly into his purple face. \"Ho, ho! So you're one of the  queer birds out of that roost, are you? Spinker's Agency! Ah, yes!\" He  fixed his gaze now upon the pale features of Brisley. \"I've seen you  before, haven't I?\"    \"Yes, Chief Inspector,\" said Brisley, licking his lips. \"Hayward's  Heath. We have been retained by--\"    \"You have been retained!\" shouted Kerry. \"You have!\"    He twisted round upon his heel, facing Monte Irvin. Angry words trembled  on his tongue. But at sight of the broken man who sat there alone,  haggard, a subtle change of expression crept into his fierce eyes, and  when he spoke again the high-pitched voice was almost gentle. \"You had  employed these men, sir, to watch--\"    He paused, glancing towards Whiteleaf, who had just entered again, and  then in the direction of the inner room where the divisional surgeon was  at work.    \"To watch my wife, Inspector. Thank you, but all the world will know  tomorrow. I might as well get used to it.\"    Monte Irvin's pallor grew positively alarming. He swayed suddenly  and extended his hands in a significant groping fashion. Kerry sprang  forward and supported him.    \"All right, Inspector--all right,\" muttered Irvin. \"Thank you. It has  been a great shock. At first I feared--\"    \"You thought your wife had been attacked, I understand? Well--it's not  so bad as that, sir. I am going to walk downstairs to the car with you.\"    \"But there is so much you will want to know--\"    \"It can keep until tomorrow. I've enough work in this peep-show here to  have me busy all night. Come along. Lean on my arm.\"    Monte Irvin rose unsteadily. He knew that there was cardiac trouble  in his family, but he had never realized before the meaning of his  heritage. He felt physically ill.    \"Inspector\"--his voice was a mere whisper--\"have you any theory to  explain--\"    \"Mrs. Irvin's disappearance? Don't worry, sir. Without exactly having a  theory I think I may say that in my opinion she will turn up presently.\"    \"God bless you,\" murmured Irvin, as Kerry assisted him out on to the  landing.    Inspector Whiteleaf held back the sliding door, the mechanism of which  had been broken so that the door now automatically remained half closed.    \"Funny, isn't it,\" said Gunn, as the two disappeared and Inspector  Whiteleaf re-entered, \"that a man should be so upset about the  disappearance of a woman he was going to divorce?\"    \"Damn funny!\" said Whiteleaf, whose temper was badly frayed by contact  with Kerry. \"I should have a good laugh if I were you.\"    He crossed the room, going in to where the surgeon was examining the  victim of this mysterious crime. Gunn stared after him dismally.    \"A person doesn't get much sympathy from the police, Brisley,\" he  declared. \"That one's almost as bad as him,\" jerking his thumb in the  direction of the landing.    Brisley smiled in a somewhat sickly manner.    \"Red Kerry is a holy terror,\" he agreed, sotto voce, glancing aside to  where Coombes was checking his notes. \"Look out! Here he comes.\"    \"Now,\" cried Kerry, swinging into the room, \"what's the game? Plotting  to defeat the ends of justice?\"    He stood with hands thrust in reefer pockets, feet wide apart, glancing  fiercely from Brisley to Gunn, and from Gunn back again to Brisley.  Neither of the representatives of Spinker's Agency ventured any remark,  and:    \"How long have you been watching Mrs. Monte Irvin?\" demanded Kerry.    \"Nearly a fortnight,\" replied Brisley.    \"Got your evidence in writing?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Up to tonight?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Dictate to Sergeant Coombes.\"    He turned on his heel and crossed to the divan upon which his oilskin  overall was lying. Rapidly he removed his reefer and his waistcoat,  folded them, and placed them neatly beside his overall. He retained his  bowler at its jaunty angle.    A cud of presumably flavorless chewing-gum he deposited in a brass bowl,  and from a little packet which he had taken out of his jacket pocket he  drew a fresh piece, redolent of mint. This he put into his mouth, and  returned the packet to its resting-place. A slim, trim figure, he stood  looking round him reflectively.    \"Now,\" he muttered, \"what about it?\"        CHAPTER VIII. KERRY CONSULTS THE ORACLE    The clock of Brixton Town Hall was striking the hour of 1 a.m. as Chief  Inspector Kerry inserted his key in the lock of the door of his house in  Spenser Road.    A light was burning in the hallway, and from the little dining-room on  the left the reflection of a cheerful fire danced upon the white paint  of the half-open door. Kerry deposited his hat, cane, and overall upon  the rack, and moving very quietly entered the room and turned on  the light. A modestly furnished and scrupulously neat apartment was  revealed. On the sheepskin rug before the fire a Manx cat was dozing  beside a pair of carpet slippers. On the table some kind of cold repast  was laid, the viands concealed under china covers. At a large bottle of  Guinness's Extra Stout Kerry looked with particular appreciation.    He heaved a long sigh of contentment, and opened the bottle of stout.  Having poured out a glass of the black and foaming liquid and satisfied  an evidently urgent thirst, he explored beneath the covers, and  presently was seated before a spread of ham and tongue, tomatoes, and  bread and butter.    A door opened somewhere upstairs, and:    \"Is that yoursel', Dan?\" inquired a deep but musical female voice.    \"Sure it is,\" replied Kerry; and no one who had heard the high official  tones of the imperious Chief Inspector would have supposed that they  could be so softened and modulated. \"You should have been asleep hours  ago, Mary.\"    \"Have ye to go out again?\"    \"I have, bad luck; but don't trouble to come down. I've all I want and  more.\"    \"If 'tis a new case I'll come down.\"    \"It's the devil's own case; but you'll get your death of cold.\"    Sounds of movement in the room above followed, and presently footsteps  on the stairs. Mrs. Kerry, enveloped in a woollen dressing-gown, which  obviously belonged to the Inspector, came into the room. Upon her Kerry  directed a look from which all fierceness had been effaced, and which  expressed only an undying admiration. And, indeed, Mary Kerry was in  many respects a remarkable character. Half an inch taller than Kerry,  she fully merited the compliment designed by that trite apothegm, \"a  fine woman.\" Large-boned but shapely, as she came in with her long dark  hair neatly plaited, it seemed to her husband--who had remained her  lover--that he saw before him the rosy-cheeked lass whom ten years  before he had met and claimed on the chilly shores of Loch Broom. By all  her neighbors Mrs. Kerry was looked upon as a proud, reserved person,  who had held herself much aloof since her husband had become Chief  Inspector; and the reputation enjoyed by Red Kerry was that of an  aggressive and uncompanionable man. Now here was a lover's meeting, not  lacking the shy, downward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#8)"],[1,"world, and you know it!\"    \"Your words are unnecessarily brutal, Smith,\" I said, feeling very  crestfallen, \"but there--perhaps I fully deserve them all.\"    \"You do!\" he assured me, but he relaxed immediately. \"A murderous  attempt is made upon my life, resulting in the death of a perfectly  innocent man in no way concerned. Along you come and let an accomplice,  perhaps a participant, escape, merely, because she has a red mouth, or  black lashes, or whatever it is that fascinates you so hopelessly!\"    He opened the wicker basket, sniffing at the contents.    \"Ah!\" he snapped, \"do you recognize this odor?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then you have some idea respecting Karamaneh's quarry?\"    \"Nothing of the kind!\"    Smith shrugged his shoulders.    \"Come along, Petrie,\" he said, linking his arm in mine.    We proceeded. Many questions there were that I wanted to put to him, but  one above all.    \"Smith,\" I said, \"what, in Heaven's name, were you doing on the mound?  Digging something up?\"    \"No,\" he replied, smiling dryly; \"burying something!\"        CHAPTER VI. UNDER THE ELMS    Dusk found Nayland Smith and me at the top bedroom window. We knew, now  that poor Forsyth's body had been properly examined, that he had died  from poisoning. Smith, declaring that I did not deserve his confidence,  had refused to confide in me his theory of the origin of the peculiar  marks upon the body.    \"On the soft ground under the trees,\" he said, \"I found his tracks right  up to the point where something happened. There were no other fresh  tracks for several yards around. He was attacked as he stood close to  the trunk of one of the elms. Six or seven feet away I found some other  tracks, very much like this.\"    He marked a series of dots upon the blotting pad at his elbow.    \"Claws!\" I cried. \"That eerie call! like the call of a nighthawk--is it  some unknown species of--flying thing?\"    \"We shall see, shortly; possibly to-night,\" was his reply. \"Since,  probably owing to the absence of any moon, a mistake was made,\" his jaw  hardened at the thoughts of poor Forsyth--\"another attempt along the  same lines will almost certainly follow--you know Fu-Manchu's system?\"    So in the darkness, expectant, we sat watching the group of nine elms.  To-night the moon was come, raising her Aladdin's lamp up to the star  world and summoning magic shadows into being. By midnight the highroad  showed deserted, the common was a place of mystery; and save for the  periodical passage of an electric car, in blazing modernity, this was a  fit enough stage for an eerie drama.    No notice of the tragedy had appeared in print; Nayland Smith was vested  with powers to silence the press. No detectives, no special constables,  were posted. My friend was of opinion that the publicity which had  been given to the deeds of Dr. Fu-Manchu in the past, together with  the sometimes clumsy co-operation of the police, had contributed not a  little to the Chinaman's success.    \"There is only one thing to fear,\" he jerked suddenly; \"he may not be  ready for another attempt to-night.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Since he has only been in England for a short time, his menagerie of  venomous things may be a limited one at present.\"    Earlier in the evening there had been a brief but violent thunderstorm,  with a tropical downpour of rain, and now clouds were scudding across  the blue of the sky. Through a temporary rift in the veiling the  crescent of the moon looked down upon us. It had a greenish tint, and it  set me thinking of the filmed, green eyes of Fu-Manchu.    The cloud passed and a lake of silver spread out to the edge of the  coppice, where it terminated at a shadow bank.    \"There it is, Petrie!\" hissed Nayland Smith.    A lambent light was born in the darkness; it rose slowly, unsteadily, to  a great height, and died.    \"It's under the trees, Smith!\"    But he was already making for the door. Over his shoulder:    \"Bring the pistol, Petrie!\" he cried; \"I have another. Give me at least  twenty yards' start or no attempt may be made. But the instant I'm under  the trees, join me.\"    Out of the house we ran, and over onto the common, which latterly had  been a pageant ground for phantom warring. The light did not appear  again; and as Smith plunged off toward the trees, I wondered if he knew  what uncanny thing was hidden there. I more than suspected that he had  solved the mystery.    His instructions to keep well in the rear I understood. Fu-Manchu, or  the creature of Fu-Manchu, would attempt nothing in the presence of a  witness. But we knew full well that the instrument of death which was  hidden in the elm coppice could do its ghastly work and leave no clue,  could slay and vanish. For had not Forsyth come to a dreadful end while  Smith and I were within twenty yards of him?    Not a breeze stirred, as Smith, ahead of me--for I had slowed my  pace--came up level with the first tree. The moon sailed clear of the  straggling cloud wisps which alone told of the recent storm; and I noted  that an irregular patch of light lay silvern on the moist ground under  the elms where otherwise lay shadow.    He passed on, slowly. I began to run again. Black against the silvern  patch, I saw him emerge--and look up.    \"Be careful, Smith!\" I cried--and I was racing under the trees to join  him.    Uttering a loud cry, he leaped--away from the pool of light.    \"Stand back, Petrie!\" he screamed--\"Back! further!\"    He charged into me, shoulder lowered, and sent me reeling!    Mixed up with his excited cry I had heard a loud splintering and  sweeping of branches overhead; and now as we staggered into the shadows  it seemed that one of the elms was reaching down to touch us! So, at  least, the phenomenon presented itself to my mind in that fleeting  moment while Smith, uttering his warning cry, was hurling me back.    Then the truth became apparent.    With an appalling crash, a huge bough fell from above. One piercing,  awful shriek there was, a crackling of broken branches, and a choking  groan...    The crack of Smith's pistol close beside me completed my confusion of  mind.    \"Missed!\" he yelled. \"Shoot it, Petrie! On your left! For God's sake  don't miss it!\"    I turned. A lithe black shape was streaking past me. I  fired--once--twice. Another frightful cry made yet more hideous the  nocturne.    Nayland Smith was directing the ray of a pocket torch upon the fallen  bough.    \"Have you killed it, Petrie?\" he cried.    \"Yes, yes!\"    I stood beside him, looking down. From the tangle of leaves and twigs  an evil yellow face looked up at us. The features were contorted with  agony, but the malignant eyes, wherein light was dying, regarded us with  inflexible hatred. The man was pinned beneath the heavy bough; his back  was broken; and as we watched, he expired, frothing slightly at the  mouth, and quitted his tenement of clay, leaving those glassy eyes set  hideously upon us.    \"The pagan gods fight upon our side,\" said Smith strangely. \"Elms have a  dangerous habit of shedding boughs in still weather--particularly after  a storm. Pan, god of the woods, with this one has performed Justice's  work of retribution.\"    \"I don't understand. Where was this man--\"    \"Up the tree, lying along the bough which fell, Petrie! That is why he  left no footmarks. Last night no doubt he made his escape by swinging  from bough to bough, ape fashion, and descending to the ground somewhere  at the other side of the coppice.\"    He glanced at me.    \"You are wondering, perhaps,\" he suggested, \"what caused the mysterious  light? I could have told you this morning, but I fear I was in a bad  temper, Petrie. It's very simple: a length of tape soaked in spirit or  something of the kind, and sheltered from the view of any one watching  from your windows, behind the trunk of the tree; then, the end ignited,  lowered, still behind the tree, to the ground. The operator swinging it  around, the flame ascended, of course. I found the unburned fragment of  the tape last night, a few yards from here.\"    I was peering down at Fu-Manchu's servant, the hideous yellow man who  lay dead in a bower of elm leaves.    \"He has some kind of leather bag beside him,\" I began--    \"Exactly!\" rapped Smith. \"In that he carried his dangerous instrument of  death; from that he released it!\"    \"Released what?\"    \"What your fascinating friend came to recapture this morning.\"    \"Don't taunt me, Smith!\" I said bitterly. \"Is it some species of bird?\"    \"You saw the marks on Forsyth's body, and I told you of those which I  had traced upon the ground here. They were caused by claws, Petrie!\"    \"Claws! I thought so! But what claws?\"    \"The claws of a poisonous thing. I recaptured the one used last night,  killed it--against my will--and buried it on the mound. I was afraid to  throw it in the pond, lest some juvenile fisherman should pull it out  and sustain a scratch. I don't know how long the claws would remain  venomous.\"    \"You are treating me like a child, Smith,\" I said slowly. \"No doubt I  am hopelessly obtuse, but perhaps you will tell me what this Chinaman  carried in a leather bag and released upon Forsyth. It was something  which you recaptured, apparently with the aid of a plate of cold turbot  and a jug of milk! It was something, also, which Karamaneh had been sent  to recapture with the aid--\"    I stopped.    \"Go on,\" said Nayland Smith, turning the ray to the left, \"what did she  have in the basket?\"    \"Valerian,\" I replied mechanically.    The ray rested upon the lithe creature that I had shot down.    It was a black cat!    \"A cat will go through fire and water for valerian,\" said Smith; \"but I  got first innings this morning with fish and milk! I had recognized the  imprints under the trees for those of a cat, and I knew, that if a cat  had been released here it would still be hiding in the neighborhood,  probably in the bushes. I finally located a cat, sure enough, and  came for bait! I"]]]
