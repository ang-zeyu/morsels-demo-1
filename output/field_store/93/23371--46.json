Being together at  Oxford, they went one day to see the public library, and were shown,  among other books, a Virgil, finely printed and exquisitely bound. Lord  Falkland, to divert the king, proposed that he should make a trial of  his fortune by the _Sortes Virgilanae_. The king opening the book, the  passage he happened to light upon was part of Dido's imprecation against  Aeneas in lib. iv. l. 615. King Charles seeming concerned at the  accident, Lord Falkland would likewise try his own fortune, hoping he  might fall upon some passage that could have no relation to his case,  and thus divert the king's thoughts from any impression the other might  have upon him; but the place Lord Falkland stumbled upon was still more  suited to his destiny, being the expressions of Evander upon the  untimely death of his son Pallas, lib. xi. Lord Falkland fell in the  battle of Newbury, in 1644, and Charles was beheaded in 1649.    The kind of divination among the Jews, termed by them Bath Kol, or the  daughter of the voice, was not very dissimilar to the _Sortes Sanctorum_  of the Christians. The mode of practising it was by appealing to the  first words accidentally heard from any one speaking or reading. The  following is an instance from the Talmud:--Rabbi Jochanau and Rabbi  Simeon. Ben Lachish, desiring to see the face of R. Samuel, a Babylonish  doctor: \"Let us follow,\" said they, \"the hearing of Bath Kol.\"  Travelling, therefore, near a school, they heard the voice of a boy:  reading these words out of the First Book of Samuel, \"And Samuel died.\"  They observed this, and inferred from hence that their friend Samuel was  dead, and so they found it. Some of the ancient Christians too, it  seems, used to go to church with a purpose of receiving as the will of  heaven the words of scripture that were singing at their entrance.    To pay a very great deference in opening upon a place of scripture, as  to its affording an assurance of salvation, used to be a very common  practice amongst the people called Methodists, but chiefly those of the  Calvinistic persuasion; this, it is probable, has declined in proportion  with the earnestness of these people in other respects. They had also  another opinion, viz. that if the recollection of any particular text of  scripture happened to arise in their minds, this was likewise looked  upon as a kind of immediate revelation from heaven. This they call being  presented or brought home to them!           *       *       *       *       *      THE GATHERER          \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other      men's stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *    Whoever the following story may be fathered on, Sir John Hamilton was  certainly its parent. The duke of Rutland, at one of his levees, being  at a loss (as probably most kings, princes, and viceroys occasionally  are) for something to say to every person he was bound in etiquette to  notice, remarked to Sir John Hamilton that there was \"a prospect of an  excellent crop:--the timely rain,\" observed the duke, \"will bring every  thing above ground.\" \"God forbid, your excellency!\" exclaimed the  courtier. His excellency stared, whilst Sir John continued, sighing  heavily as he spoke:--\"yes, God forbid! for I have got _three wives_  under it.\"--_Barrington's Sketches_.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a singular circumstance that Italia, or, as it is called in  English, Italy, has, under all the changes and revolutions to which it  has been subjected, always preserved its name.

The origin of idolatry is by many attributed to the age of Eber, though  most of the fathers place it no higher than that of Serug; but it  appears to me certain, that image worship existed in the time of Jacob,  from the account of Rachel taking images along with her on leaving her  father's house, which is given in the book of Genesis.

This word, which signifies nonsense, _alias_ talk without meaning, is  supposed to have first arisen at the time when all pleadings at the bar  were in Latin. There was a cause, it seems, about a cock, belonging to  the plaintiff Matthias; the counsel, in the heat of the harangue, by  often repeating the words _gallus_ and _Matthias_, happened to blunder,  and, instead of saying _gallus Matthiae_, said _galli Matthias_, which  at length became a general name for all confused, embroiled language and  discourse.

I have thought on this hour with many a tear,    In the timid weakness of woman's fear;    It comes, and I rise, the test above,    In the dauntless strength of woman's love.    Gaze not upon me with looks so sad--    My step is firm, and my heart is glad;    This last, last sigh for my home shall be--    Past is the trial--I go with thee.    _Dublin_.

I GOT to the Treasury about noon, but  first of all I GOT shaved and drest. I soon GOT into the secret of  GETTING a memorial before the board, but I could not GET an answer then;  however, I GOT intelligence from the messenger that I should most likely  GET one next morning. As soon as I GOT back to my inn, I GOT my supper  and GOT to bed. It was not long before I GOT to sleep. When I GOT up in  the morning, I GOT my breakfast, and then GOT myself drest, that I might  GET out in time, to GET an answer to my memorial. As soon as I GOT it, I  GOT into the chaise, and GOT home by three o'clock."]]]
