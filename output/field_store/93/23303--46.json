Then, in a cool, dry place, lay the bunches out on racks in a  single layer, taking care not to crush nor bruise them.    62. UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE WITH WATER.--Grape juice may be made either  with or without water. That in which water is used in the making usually  requires no diluting when it is served as a beverage. Concord grapes are  perhaps used more commonly for the making of grape juice than any other  variety, but other kinds, particularly Catawbas and Niagaras, may be  used as well.    UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE WITH WATER    12 qt. grapes  2 qt. water  4 lb. sugar    Wash the grapes and remove them from the stems. Put them with the water  into a preserving kettle, and heat gradually until the skins of the  grapes burst. Dip off as much juice as possible, and put it into a jelly  bag. Continue to heat and dip off the juice in this way until the pulp  is comparatively dry. Then add a little more water to the pulp and put  it in the bag to drip. When all the juice has dripped through the bag,  pour it back into the preserving kettle, add the sugar, and bring to the  boiling point. Stir frequently, so that the sugar will be well  dissolved. Pour into jars or bottles, seal, and sterilize by cooking for  about 5 minutes in hot water that nearly covers the bottles. Any large  receptacle that will hold sufficient water may be used as a sterilizer.    63. UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE WITHOUT WATER.--When grape juice is made  without water, it is both thick and rich. Consequently, it should  usually be diluted with water when it is served as a beverage.    UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE WITHOUT WATER    12 qt. grapes  3 lb. sugar    Wash the grapes, remove them from the stems, and put them into a  preserving kettle. Heat very slowly and mash with a spoon, so that  enough juice will be pressed out and thus prevent the grapes from  scorching. Remove the juice as it forms and put it into a jelly bag.  When all of it has been taken from the grapes and strained through the  jelly bag, strain the pulp and put all the juice into a preserving  kettle, add the sugar, and bring to the boiling point. Pour into bottles  or jars, seal, and sterilize in a water bath for about 5 minutes.      PEACHES    64. PEACHES may be divided into two general classes: those having a  yellow skin and those having a white skin. In each of these classes are  found both _clingstone_ and _freestone_ peaches; that is, peaches whose  pulp adheres tightly to the seed, or stone, and those in which the pulp  can be separated easily from the stone. When peaches are purchased for  canning or for any use in which it is necessary to remove the seeds,  freestones should be selected. Clingstones may be used when the stones  are allowed to remain in the fruit, as in pickled peaches, and for jams,  preserves, or butters, in which small pieces may be used or the entire  peach mashed. Whether to select yellow or white peaches, however, is  merely a matter of taste, as some persons prefer one kind and some  the other.    65. Peaches are not satisfactory for jelly making, because they do not  contain pectin. However, the juice of peaches makes a very good sirup if  it is sweetened and cooked until it is thick. Such sirup is really just  as delicious as maple sirup with griddle cakes. Peaches are used to a  large extent for canning and are also made into preserves, jams, and  butters. In addition, they are much used without cooking, for they are  favored by most persons. When they are to be served whole, they should  be washed and then wiped with a damp cloth to remove the fuzz. The skins  may be removed by blanching the peaches in boiling water or peeling them  with a sharp knife. If they are then sliced or cut in any desirable way  and served with cream and sugar, they make a delicious dessert.    66. STEWED PEACHES.--Fresh stewed peaches make a very desirable dessert  to serve with simple cake or cookies. Children may very readily eat such  dessert without danger of digestive disturbances. Adding a tablespoonful  of butter to the hot stewed peaches and then serving them over freshly  made toast makes a delightful breakfast dish. The cooked peaches may  also be run through a sieve, reheated with a little flour or corn starch  to thicken them slightly, and then served hot on buttered toast.    STEWED PEACHES  (Sufficient to Serve Eight)    1-1/2 qt. peaches  1 lb. sugar  1 c. water    Peel the peaches, cut into halves, and remove the seeds. Put the sugar  and water over the fire to cook in a saucepan and bring to a rapid boil.  Add the peaches and cook until they may be easily pierced with a fork.    67. BAKED PEACHES.--When peaches are to be baked, select large firm  ones. Wash them thoroughly and cut them into halves, removing the  stones. Place the peaches in a shallow pan, fill the cavities with  sugar, and dot the top of each half with butter. Set in the oven and  bake until the peaches become soft. Serve hot or cold, either with or  without cream, as desired.      PEARS    68. PEARS, like apples, come in summer and winter varieties. The summer  varieties must be utilized during the summer and early fall or must be  canned at this time to preserve them for future use. Winter pears,  however, may be stored, for they keep like apples. A number of the small  varieties of pears are much used for pickling. Pears are most valuable  when they are canned and used for sauce. They cannot be used for jelly,  because they do not contain sufficient acid nor pectin. The juice from  canned pears, because of its mild flavor, is often found to be valuable  in the feeding of invalids or persons who have gastric troubles. It is  usually advisable to pick pears before they are entirely ripe, for then  they may be kept for a considerable length of time and will  ripen slowly.    69. BAKED PEARS.--Although pears are rather mild in flavor, they are  delicious when baked if lemon is added. Wash thoroughly pears that are  to be baked, cut them into halves, and remove the cores. Place them in a  shallow pan, fill the holes in the center with sugar, dot with butter,  and place a thin slice of lemon over each piece. Pour a few spoonfuls of  water into the pan, set in the oven, and bake until the pears can be  easily pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven and serve hot or cold.      PLUMS    70. PLUMS are among the very strong acid fruits. Some varieties of them  seem to be more tart after they are cooked than before, but, as already  explained, this condition is due to the fact that the acid contained in  the skin and around the seeds is liberated during the cooking. This  fruit, of which there are numerous varieties, is generally used for  canning, preserving, etc. It does not make jelly successfully in all  cases unless some material containing pectin is added. Very firm plums  may have the skins removed by blanching if it seems advisable to  take them off.    71. STEWED PLUMS.--Because of the many varieties of plums with their  varying degrees of acidity, it is difficult to make a recipe with a  quantity of sugar that will suit all kinds. The recipe given here is  suitable for medium sour plums, such as egg plums and the common red and  yellow varieties. Damsons and green gages will probably require more  sugar, while prune plums may require less.    STEWED PLUMS  (Sufficient to Serve Eight)    1-1/2 qt. plums  1 lb. sugar  3/4 c. water    Wash the plums and prick each one two or three times with a fork. Bring  the sugar and water to the boiling point and, when rapidly boiling, add  the plums. Cook until they are tender, remove from the fire, cool,  and serve.      QUINCES    72. QUINCES are one of the non-perishable fruits. They mature late in  the fall and may be kept during the winter in much the same way as  apples. While quinces are not used so extensively as most other fruits,  there are many uses to which they may be put and much can be done with a  small quantity. For instance, various kinds of preserves and marmalades  may be made entirely of quinces or of a combination of quinces and some  other fruit. They also make excellent jelly. As their flavor is very  strong, a small quantity of quince pulp used with apples or some other  fruit will give the typical flavor of quinces. When combined with sweet  apples, they make a very delicious sauce.    The skin of quinces is covered with a thick fuzz, which can be removed  by wiping the fruit with a damp cloth. A point that should be remembered  about quinces is that they are extremely hard and require long cooking  to make them tender and palatable.    73. STEWED QUINCES AND APPLES.--The combination of quinces and apples is  very delicious. Sweet apples, which are difficult to use as a cooked  fruit because of a lack of flavor, may be combined very satisfactorily  with quinces, for the quinces impart a certain amount of their strong  flavor to the bland apples and thus the flavor of both is improved.    STEWED QUINCES AND APPLES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. sweet apples  1 pt. quinces  1 lb. sugar  1 c. water    Wash, peel, core, and quarter the fruit. Add the sugar to the water and  place over the fire until it conies to a rapid boil. Then add the  quinces and cook until they are partly softened. Add the sweet apples  and continue the cooking until both are tender. Remove from the fire,  cool, and serve.      RHUBARB    74. RHUBARB is in reality not a fruit, but it is always considered as  such because it is cooked with sugar and served as a fruit. It has the  advantage of coming early in the spring before there are many fruits in  the market. As it contains a large quantity of oxalic acid, it is very  sour and must be cooked with considerable sugar to become palatable, the  addition of which makes the food value of cooked rhubarb very high.  Rhubarb is much used for pies and is frequently canned for sauce. It is  also used as a cheap filler with a more expensive fruit in the making of  marmalades,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#7)"],[1,"the water-holes by 8 A. M.. The morning  happened to be extremely hot, which, under the want of water and food the  preceding evening, made Drysdale very ill, and John Douglas and Isaac  Reid were scarcely able to walk when we arrived at the first water-hole.  But how the jaded bullocks were to draw the heavy loads thus far in the  extreme heat, was a subject of anxious thought to me. William Baldock  again returned to Mr. Kennedy with two barrels of water on a horse, a  horn full of tea, etc. On his way he met six of the drays, the drivers of  which were almost frantic and unable to do their work from thirst. He  brought me back intelligence that Mr. Kennedy still remained at his  encampment, with the two remaining drays, whereof the drivers (Mortimer  and Bond) had allowed their teams, with bows, yokes, and chains, to  escape, although each driver had been expressly ordered to watch his own  team during the night. This was a most serious misfortune to the whole  party. The rest of the drays could not be brought as far as my camp, but  I ordered the cattle to be released and driven forward to the water,  which they reached by the evening, sufficient guards being left with the  drays. The shepherd with the sheep could not get so far as the water, and  the poor fellow had almost lost his senses, when Mr. Stephenson, who had  hastened back with several bottles, relieved his thirst, and, as the man  said, \"saved his life.\"    Our position might indeed have been critical, had the natives been  hostile, or as numerous as I had formerly seen them at that very part of  the Bogan. Separated into three parties, and exhausted with thirst and  heat, the men and the drays might have been easily assailed. No natives,  however, molested us; and I subsequently found that the tribe, with which  I was on very friendly terms there formerly, were still amicably disposed  towards us.    7TH JANUARY.--Early this morning, M'Avoy brought in the spare bullocks,  having been sent forward by Mr. Kennedy to travel on during the night.  The shoemaker also brought in one of the lost teams and part of the  other. I sent back, by Baldock, this morning, water for the men in charge  of the drays, and some tea and bread for Mr. Kennedy. He would also have  gone in search of the four bullocks still missing, but Mr. Kennedy sent  him again to me to procure something to eat. The drays carrying the  provisions had not come up, and my party too was short. The day surpassed  in heat any I had ever seen: the thermometer at noon in the shade stood  at 109 deg., a gentle hot wind blowing. The camp of Mr. Kennedy was distant  at least 16 miles from mine near Bugabada.    The six drays came in about 4 P. M.; the sheep not until long after dark.  Bread, gelatine, and ten gallons of water were sent back to Mr. Kennedy,  and a memorandum from me apprising him of my arrangement for drawing  forward the two drays, which he had taken such good care of, and which  was as follows: Two teams to leave my camp on the evening of next day, to  be attached on their arrival to the two drays with which they were to  come forward, travelling by moonlight during the rest of the night, until  they should be met by two other fresh teams, destined to meet them early  next morning. Also I informed Mr. Kennedy that it was not my intention to  send after the four stray bullocks until the drays came in, and the party  could be again united. Thermometer again 109 deg. in the shade all day.    The CALOTIS CUNEIFOLIA was conspicuous amongst the grass. This was the  common BURR, so detrimental to the Australian wool. Small as are the  capitula of this flower, its seeds or achenia are armed with awns having  reflexed hooks scarcely visible to the naked eye; it is these that are  found so troublesome among the wool.    8TH JANUARY.--The messenger returned from Mr. Kennedy saying he had found  him and the men with him, in a state of great distress from want of  water, having given great part of what had formerly been sent to a young  dying bullock, in hopes thereby to save its life. He also stated that a  tribe of natives were on their track about three miles behind. Baldock  had seen several bullocks dead on the way. In the evening the two first  teams were sent off as arranged. This day had also been very sultry,  especially towards evening.    9TH JANUARY.--Early this morning, the two relieving teams were despatched  as arranged, and at noon Mr. Kennedy and the whole entered the camp. We  had been very fortunate, under such trying circumstances, to suffer so  little loss, and I determined never to move the party again, until I  could ascertain where the water was at which it should encamp. I had been  previously assured by the young native that water was still to be found  at Cadduldury, and the disappointment had nearly proved fatal to the  whole party.    On the banks of the Bogan, the ATRIPLEX HAGNOIDES formed a round white-  looking bush.    I rode forward to Muda, accompanied by Dr. Stephenson and by Piper, and  had an interview with some of the heads of the old tribe, who remembered  my former visit, and very civilly accompanied me to show me my old track  and marked trees, which I found passed a little to the northward of my  present encampment. The chief, my old friend, had been killed in a fight  with the natives of the Macquarie, not long before. Two old grey-haired  men sitting silent in a gunya behind, were pointed out to me as his  brothers, one of whom so very much resembled him, that I had at first  imagined he was the man himself. These sat doubled up on their hams  opposite to each other, under the withered bushes, naked, and grey, and  melancholy--sad and hopeless types of their fading race!    The chief who formerly guided us so kindly had fallen in a hopeless  struggle for the existence of his tribe with the natives of the river  Macquarie, allied with the border police, on one side; and the wild  natives of the Darling on the other. All I could learn about the rest of  the tribe was, that the men were almost all dead, and that their wives  were chiefly servants at stock stations along the Macquarie.    The natives of Muda assured me there was no water nearer than Nyingan, a  large pond which I knew was 22 1/3 miles distant, in a direct line lower  down the Bogan. The ponds of Muda, their great store of water, and known  to white men as the largest on the Bogan, were alarmingly low, and it  became evident that our progress under such a scarcity of water would be  attended with difficulty. These natives gave us also a friendly hint that  \"GENTLEMEN\" should be careful of the spears of the natives of Nyingan, as  many natives of Nyingan had been shot lately by white men from Wellington  Valley.    Among the woods we observed the white-flowered TEUCRIUM RACEMOSUM, the  JUSTICIA MEDIA, a small herbaceous plant with deep pink flowers; also a  STENOCHILUS and FUSANUS (the Quandang), although not in fruit; a new  species of STIPA, remarkable for its fine silky ears and coarse rough  herbage.[*] This place produced also a fine new species of Chloris in the  way of C. TRUNCATA, but with upright ears, and hard three-ribbed  pales,[**] and we here observed, for the first time, a fine new  EREMOPHILA with white flowers, forming a tree fifteen feet high.[***] The  beautiful DAMASONIUM OVALIFOLIUM, with white flowers red in the centre,  still existed in the water.    [* S. SCABRA (Lindl. MS.), aristis nudis, paleis pubescentibus basi  villosis, glumis setaceo-acuminatis glabris, foliis scabropilosis  involutis culmis brevioribus, geniculis pubescentibus, ligula oblonga  subciliata.]    [** C.

It  was night ere they returned with the intelligence that they had found his  track ten miles off to the S. W. when darkness prevented them from  following it further.    I ascertained, by observations of the stars Aldebaran and Orionis, that  out present camp near Bugabada was in latitude 31 deg. 56', and thus very  near the place where Mr. Dixon's journey down the Bogan in 1833 had  terminated. Thermometer at noon, 90 deg.; at 9 P. M., 70 deg.; with wet bulb,  63 deg..    10TH JANUARY.--Early this morning Mr. Kennedy and Piper went to the S. W.  in search of the shepherd and sheep, while at the same time I sent  William Baldock and Yaranigh back along our track in search of the stray  bullocks. Meanwhile I conducted the party along my former track to Muda,  where we met Mr. Kennedy and Piper with the shepherd and sheep, already  arrived there. The shepherd stated that the fatigue of having been on  watch the previous night had overcome him; that he fell asleep, and that  the sheep went astray; that he followed and found them, but lost himself.  He had met one or two natives who offered him honey, etc. which he  declined.    We encamped beside the old stock-yard and the ruins of a dairy, only  visible in the remaining excavation. But a paddock was still in such a  state of preservation, that in one day we completed the enclosure. We had  passed near Bugabada similar remains of a cattle station. This position  of Muda was a fine place for such an establishment; a high bank nearly  clear of timber, overlooking a noble reach of great capacity, and  surrounded by an open forest country, covered with luxuriant grass. The  last crop stood up yellow, like a neglected field of oats, in the way of  a young crop shooting up amongst it."]]]
