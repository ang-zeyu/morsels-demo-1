There is but one character on earth, sir,\" he  would add, \"that I detest; and that is the man who praises,  indiscriminately, every dish that is set before him.

The first Grimaldi celebrated on the stage, appeared at Paris about the  year 1735, when his athletic force and extraordinary agility procured  him the sobriquet of \"Jambe de Fer,\" or iron-leg. In 1742, when Mahomet  Effendi, ambassador of the Porte, visited Paris, he was received with  the highest honour and utmost distinction; and the court having ordered  a performance for the Turk's entertainment, Grimaldi was commanded to  exert himself to effect that object. In obedience to his directions, in  making a surprising leap, his foot actually struck a lustre, placed high  from the stage, and one of the glass drops was thrown in the face of the  ambassador. It was then customary to demand some reward from the  personage for whom the entertainment was prepared, and, at the  conclusion of the piece, Grimaldi waited upon the Mussulman for the  usual present. If the Turk had concealed the expression of his anger at  the accident, it was not however extinct, for on the appearance of the  buffoon, he directed him to be seized by his attendants, and transported  in his theatrical costume, to his residence, where, after undergoing a  severe bastinado, the hapless actor was thrust into the street, with  only his pedal honour for his recompense.           *       *       *       *       *      NEGROES' HEIR LOOM.

The loose eccentric is of course a familiar arrangement in connection  with poppet valves, as well as for the purpose of reversing an engine  when driving a single slide valve. Its use in connection with the Meyer  cut-off valves, however, is believed to be new; and the reason for its  employment will be understood by the aid of Fig. 6.    For the purposes of this explanation we may neglect the angular  vibrations of the connecting rod and eccentric rod, considering them  both as of infinite length. Let O be the center of the shaft; let L O M  represent the face of the main valve seat, in which is shown the port  leading to the cylinder; and let A be the edge of the main valve, at the  beginning of a stroke of the piston. It will then be apparent that the  center of the eccentric must at that instant be at the point, C, if the  engine turn to the left, as shown by the arrow, and at G, if the  rotation be in the opposite direction; C and G then may be taken as the  centers of the \"go-ahead\" and the \"backing\" eccentrics respectively,  which operate the main valve through the intervention of the link.    Now, in each revolution of the engine, the cut-off eccentric in effect  revolves in the same direction about the center of the main eccentric.  Consequently, we may let R C S, parallel to L O M, represent the face of  the cut-off valve seat, or, in other words, the back of the main valve,  in which the port, C N, corresponds to one of those shown in Fig. 4; and  the motion of the cut-off valve over this seat will be precisely, the  same as though it were driven directly by an eccentric revolving around  the center, C.    In determining the position of this eccentric, we proceed upon the  assumption that the best results will be effected by such an arrangement  that when cutting off at the earliest point required, the cut-off valve  shall, at the instant of closing the port, be moving over it at its  highest speed. And this requires that the center of the eccentric shall  at the instant in question lie in the vertical line through C.    [Illustration: Figs. 3-12 IMPROVED STEAM ENGINE.--BY PROF MACCORD.]    Next, the least distance to be followed being assigned, the angle  through which the crank will turn while the piston is traveling that  distance is readily found; then, drawing an indefinite line C T, making  with the vertical line, G O, an angle, G C T. equal to the one thus  determined, any point upon that line may be assumed as the position of  the required center of the cut-off eccentric, at the beginning of the  stroke.    But again, in order that the cut-off may operate in the same manner when  backing as when going ahead, this eccentric must be symmetrically  situated with respect to both C and G; and since L O M bisects and is  perpendicular to G C, it follows that if the cut-off eccentric be fixed  on the shaft, its center must be located at H, the intersection of C T  with L M. This would require the edge of the cut-off valve at the given  instant to be at Q, perpendicularly over H; and the travel over the main  valve would be equal to twice C H, the virtual lever arm of the  eccentric, the actual traverse in the valve chest being twice O H, the  real eccentricity.    This being clearly excessive, let us next see what will occur if the  lever arm, CH, be reduced as in the diagram to CK. The edge of the  cut-off valve will then be at N; it instantly begins to close the port.  CN, but not so rapidly as the main valve opens the port, AB.    The former motion increases in rapidity, while the latter decreases;  therefore at some point they will become equal in velocity, and the  openings of the two ports will be the same; and the question is, Will  this maximum effective port area give a sufficient supply of steam?    This diagram is the same as the one actually used in the engine under  consideration, in which it was required to follow a minimum distance of  5 inches in the stroke of 22. Under these conditions it is found that  the actual port opening for that point of cutting off is three-fifths of  that allowed when following full stroke, whereas the speed of the piston  at the time when this maximum opening occurs is less than half its  greatest speed.    This, it would seem, is ample; but we now find the eccentric, K, no  longer in the right position for backing; when the engine is reversed it  ought to be at, P, the angle, POL, being equal to the angle, KOL. By  leaving it free, therefore, to move upon the shaft, by the means above  described, through the angle, KOP, the desired object is accomplished.  The real eccentricity is now reduced in the proportion of OK to OH,  while the lengths of the cut-off valves, and what is equally important,  their travel over the back of the main valve, are reduced in the  proportion of CK to CH, in this instance nearly one-half; a gain quite  sufficient to warrant the adoption of the expedient.    The third, and perhaps the most notable, peculiarity is the manner of  suspending and operating the main link. As before stated, this link is  used only for reversing, and is therefore always in \"full gear\" in one  direction or the other; and the striking feature of the arrangement here  used is that, whether going ahead or backing, there is _no slipping of  the link upon the link block_.    The link itself is of the simplest form, being merely a curved flat bar,  L, in which are two holes, A and B (Fig. 7), by which the link is hung  upon the pins, which project from the sides of the eccentric rods at  their upper ends.    This is most clearly shown in Fig. 8, which is a top view of the  reversing gear. The link block is a socket, open on the side next to the  eccentric rods, but closed on the side opposite, from which projects the  journal, J, as shown in Fig. 9, which is a vertical section by the  plane, XY. This journal turns freely in the outer end of a lever, M,  which transmits the reciprocating motion to the valve, through the  rock-shaft, O, and another lever, N. Connected with the lever, M, by the  bridge-piece, K, and facing it, is a slotted arm, G, as shown in the end  view, Fig. 10. The center line of this slot lies in the plane which  contains the axes of the journal, J, and of the shaft, O.    A block, E, is fitted to slide in the slotted arm, G; and in this block  is fixed a pin, P. A bridle-rod, R, connects P with the pin, A, of one  of the eccentric-rods, prolonged for that purpose as shown in Fig. 8;  and a suspension-rod, S, connects the same pin, P, with the upper end of  the reversing lever, T, which is operated by the worm and sector. The  distance, JO, in Fig. 10, or in other words the length of the lever, M,  is precisely equal to the distance, AB, in Fig. 7, measured in a right  line; and the rods, R and S, from center to center of the eyes, are also  each of precisely this same length. Further, the axis about which the  reversing lever, T, vibrates is so situated that when that lever, as in  Fig 11, is thrown full to the left, the pin in its upper end is exactly  in line with the rock-shaft, O.    When the parts are in this position, the suspension-rod, S, the arm, G,  and the lever, M, will be as one piece, and their motions will be  identical, consisting simply of vibration about the axis of the  rock-shaft, O. The motion of the lever, M, is then due solely to the  pin, B, which is in this case exactly in line with the journal, J, so  that the result is the same as though this eccentric rod were connected  directly to the lever; and the pin, P, being also in line with B and J,  and kept so by the suspension-rod, S, it will be seen that the  bridle-rod, R, will move with the link, L, as though the two were  rigidly fastened together.    When the reversing lever, T, is thrown full to the right, as in Fig. 12,  the pin, P, is drawn to the inner end of the slot in the arm, G, and is  thus exactly in line with the rock-shaft, O. The suspension-rod, S,  will, therefore, be at rest; but the pin, A, will have been drawn, by  the bridle-rod, R, into line with the journal, J, and the bridle-rod  itself will now vibrate with the lever, M, whose sole motion will be  derived from the pin, A.    There is, then, no block slip whatever when the link thus suspended and  operated is run in \"full gear,\" either forward or backward.    If this arrangement be used in cases where the link is used as an  expansion device, there will be, of course, some block slip while  running in the intermediate gears. But even then, it is to be observed  that the motion of the pin, A, relatively to the rocker arm is one of  vibration about the moving center, J; and its motion relatively to the  sliding block, E, is one of vibration about the center, P, whose motion  relatively to E is a small amount of sliding in the direction of the  slot, due to the fact that the rocker arm itself, which virtually  carries the block, E, vibrates about O, while the suspension-rod, S,  vibrates about another fixed center. It will thus be seen that, finally,  the block slip will be determined by the difference in curvature of arcs  _which curve in the same direction_, whether the engine be running  forward or backward; whereas in the common modes of suspension the block  slip in one direction is substantially the half sum of the curvatures of  two arcs curving in opposite directions.    Consequently it would appear that the average action of the new  arrangement would be at least equal to that of the old in respect to  reducing the block slip when running in the intermediate gears, while in  the full gears it entirely obviates that objectionable feature.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW RUSSIAN TORPEDO BOAT, THE POTI.
