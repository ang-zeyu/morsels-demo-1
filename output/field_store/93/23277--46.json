[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#7)"],[1,"shall be considered in the order of the times to which they were  postponed.  It is not in order to postpone to a time beyond that session  [Sec. 42] of the assembly, except* [In Congress a motion cannot be  postponed to the next session, but it is customary in ordinary  societies.] to the day of the next session when it comes up with the  unfinished business, and consequently takes precedence of new business  [Sec. 44].  If it is desired to hold an adjourned meeting to consider a  special subject, the time to which the assembly shall adjourn [Sec. 10]  should be first fixed before making the motion to postpone the subject  to that day.    22. To Commit [or Recommit as it is called when the subject has been  previously committed].  This motion takes precedence of the motions to  Amend or Indefinitely Postpone, and yields to any Privileged [Sec. 9] or  Incidental    === Page 42 ============================================================    [Sec. 8] Question, and also to the motion to Lie on the Table, or for the  Previous Question, or to Postpone to a certain day.  It can be amended  by altering the committee, or giving it instructions.  It is debatable,  and opens to debate [Sec. 35] the merits of the question it is proposed to  commit.    The Form of this motion is \"to refer the subject to a committee.\"  When  different committees are proposed they should he voted in the following  order:  (1) Committee the whole [Sec. 32], (2) a standing committee, and  (3) a special (or select) committee.  The number of a committee is  usually decided without the formality of a motion, as in filling blanks  [Sec. 25]:  the Chairman asks \"of how many shall the committee consist?\"  and a question is then put upon each number suggested, beginning with  the largest.  The number and kind of the committee need not be decided  till after it has been voted to refer the subject to a committee.  If  the committee is a select one, and the motion does not include the  method of appointing it, and there is no standing rule on the subject,  the Chairman inquires how the committee shall be appointed, and this is  usually decided informally.  Sometimes the Chair \"appoints,\" in which  case he names the members of the committee and no vote is taken    === Page 43 ============================================================    upon them; or the committee is \"nominated\" either by the Chair or  members of the assembly (no member nominating more than one except by  general consent), and then they are all voted upon together, except  where more nominations are made than the number of the committee, when  they shall be voted upon singly.    Where a committee is one for action (a committee of arrangements for  holding a public meeting, for example), it should generally be small, and  no one placed upon it who is not favorable to the proposed action; and  if any such should be appointed he should ask to be excused.  But when  the committee is for deliberation or investigation, it is of the utmost  importance that all parties be represented on it, so that in committee  the fullest discussion may take place, and thus diminish the chances of  unpleasant debates in the assembly.    In ordinary assemblies, by judicious appointment of committees, debates  upon delicate and troublesome questions can be mostly confined to the  committees, which will contain the representative members of all  parties.  [See Reports of Committees, Sec. 29.]    23. To Amend.  This motion takes precedence of nothing but the question  which it proposed to amend, and yields to any Privileged    === Page 44 ============================================================    [Sec. 9], Incidental [Sec. 8] or Subsidiary [Sec. 7] Question, except to  Indefinitely Postpone.  It can be amended itself, but this \"amendment of an  amendment\" cannot be amended.  An Amendment may be inconsistent with one  already adopted, or may directly conflict with the spirit of the  original motion, but it must have a direct bearing upon the subject of  that motion.  To illustrate:  a motion for a vote of thanks could be  amended by substituting for \"thanks\" the word \"censure;\" or one condemning  certain customs could be amended by adding other customs.    An Amendment may be in any of the following forms:  (a) to \"add or  insert\" certain words or paragraphs; (b) to \"strike out\" certain words  or paragraphs, the question, however, being stated by the Chair thus:  \"Shall these words (or paragraphs) stand as a part of the resolution?\"  and if this is adopted (that is, the motion to \"strike out,\" fails) it  does not preclude either amendment or a motion to \"strike out and  insert;\" (c) \"to strike certain words and insert others,\" which motion  is indivisible, and if lost does not preclude    === Page 45 ============================================================    another motion to strike out the same words and insert different ones;  (d) to \"substitute\" another motion on the same subject for the one  pending; (e) to \"divide the question\" into two or more questions, as the  mover specifies, so as to get a separate vote on any particular point or  points [see Sec. 4].    If a paragraph is inserted it should be perfected by its friends  previous to voting on it, as when once inserted it cannot be struck out  or amended except by adding to it.  The same is true in regard to words  to be inserted in a resolution, as when once inserted they cannot be  struck out, except by a motion to strike out the paragraph, or such a  portion of it as shall make the question an entirely different one from  that of inserting the particular words.  The principle involved is that  when the assembly has voted that certain words shall form a part of a  resolution, it is not in order to make another motion which involves  exactly the same question as the one they have decided.  The only way to  bring it up again is to move a Reconsideration [Sec. 27] of the vote by  which the words were inserted.    In stating the question on an Amendment the Chairman should read (1) the  passage to be amended; (2) the words to be struck out, if any; (3) the  words to be inserted, if any; and (4) the whole passage as it will stand  if    === Page 46 ============================================================    the amendment is adopted.  [For amending reports of committees, and  propositions containing several paragraphs, see Sec. 44.]    The numbers prefixed to paragraphs are only marginal indications, and  should be corrected, if necessary, by the clerk, without any motion to  amend.    The following motions cannot be amended:      To Adjourn (when unqualified) ............................ See Sec. 11.    For the Orders of the Day ................................  '' Sec. 12.    All Incidental Questions .................................  '' Sec.  8.    To Lie on the Table ......................................  '' Sec. 19.    For the Previous Question ................................  '' Sec. 20.    An Amendment of an Amendment .............................  '' Sec. 23.    To Postpone Indefinitely .................................  '' Sec. 24.    Reconsider ...............................................  '' Sec. 27.    An Amendment to Rules of Order, By-Laws or a Constitution shall require  previous notice and a two-thirds vote for its adoption [see Sec. 45].    24. To Postpone Indefinitely.  This motion takes precedence of nothing  except the Principal Question [Sec. 6], and yields to any Privileged [Sec. 9],  Incidental [Sec. 8] or Subsidiary [Sec. 7] Motion, except to Amend.  It cannot  be amended; it opens to debate the entire question which it is proposed  to postpone.  Its effect is to entirely remove the question from before  the assembly for that session [Sec. 42].    === Page 47 ============================================================    The Previous Question [Sec. 20], if ordered when this motion is pending,  applies only to it without affecting the main question.    Miscellaneous Motions.  [Sec.Sec. 25-27.]    25. Filling Blanks.  In filling blanks the largest sum and the longest  time proposed shall be first put to the question.  Sometimes the most  convenient way of amending a resolution is to create a blank by moving  to strike out a certain number or time.  It is customary for any number  of members to propose numbers to fill a blank without the formality of a  motion, these different propositions not being regarded in the light of  amendments.    Nominations are treated in a similar manner, so that the second  nomination, instead of being an amendment to the first, is an  independent motion, which, if the first fails, is to be immediately  voted upon.  Any number of nominations can be made, the Chairman  announcing each name as he hears it, and they    === Page 48 ============================================================    should be voted upon in the order announced, until one receives a vote  sufficient for an election.    26. Renewal of a Motion.  When any Principal Question [Sec. 6] or  Amendment has been once acted upon by the assembly, it cannot be taken  up again at the same session [Sec. 42] except by a motion to Reconsider [Sec.  27].  The motion to Adjourn can be renewed if there has been progress in  debate, or any business transacted.  As a general rule the introduction  of any motion that alters the state of affairs makes it admissible to  renew any Privileged or Incidental motion (excepting Suspension of the  Rules as provided in Sec. 18), or Subsidiary motion (excepting an  amendment), as in such a case the real question before the assembly is a  different one.    To illustrate:  a motion that a question lie on the table having failed,  suppose afterwards it be moved to refer the matter to a committee, it is  now in order to move again that the subject lie on the table; but such a  motion would not be in order, if it were not made till after the failure  of the motion to commit, as    === Page 49 ========"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#7)"],[1,"who  wrote of it were so bitterly rancorous that their statements must  be received with caution. For the main facts, I have relied,  wherever it was practicable, upon the official letters of the  commanding officers, taking each as authority for his own force  and loss.[Footnote: As where Broke states his own force at 330,  his antagonists at 440, and the American court of inquiry makes  the numbers 396 and 379, I have taken them as being 330 and 379  respectively. This is the only just method; I take it for granted  that each commander meant to tell the truth, and of course knew  his own force, while he might very naturally and in perfect good  faith exaggerate his antagonist's.] For all the British victories  we have British official letters, which tally almost exactly, as  regards matters of _fact_ and not of _opinion_, with the corresponding  American accounts. For the first year the British also published  official accounts of their defeats, which in the cases of the  _Guerrière_, _Macedonian_ and _Frolic_, I have followed as closely  as the accounts of the American victors. The last British official  letter published announcing a defeat was that in the case of the  _Java_, and it is the only letter that I have not strictly accepted:  The fact that no more were published thereafter is of itself  unfortunate; and from the various contradictions it contains it  would appear to have been tampered with. The surgeon's report  accompanying it is certainly false. Subsequent to 1812 no letter  of a defeated British commander was published, [Footnote: Except  about the battles on the Lakes, where I have accordingly given the  same credit to the accounts both of the British and of the Americans.]  and I have to depend upon the various British historians, especially  James, of whom more anon.    The American and British historians from whom we are thus at  times forced to draw our material regard the war from very different  stand-points, and their accounts generally differ. Each writer  naturally so colored the affair as to have it appear favorable to  his own side. Sometimes this was done intentionally and sometimes  not. Not unfrequently errors are made against the historian's own  side; as when the British author, Brenton, says that the British  brig _Peacock_ mounted 32's instead of 24's, while Lossing in his  \"Field-Book of the War of 1812\" makes the same mistake about the  armament of the American brig _Argus_. Errors of this description  are, of course, as carefully to be guarded against as any others.  Mere hearsay reports, such as \"it has been said,\" \"a prisoner on  board the opposing fleet has observed,\" \"an American (or British)  newspaper of such and such a date has remarked,\" are of course to  be rejected. There is a curious parallelism in the errors on both  sides. For example, the American, Mr. Low, writing in 1813, tells  how the _Constitution_, 44, captured the _Guerrière_ of 49 guns,  while the British Lieutenant Low, writing in 1880, tells how the  _Pelican_, 18, captured the _Argus_ of 20 guns. Each records the  truth but not the whole truth, for although rating 44 and 18 the  victors carried respectively 54 and 21 guns, of heavier metal than  those of their antagonists. Such errors are generally intentional.  Similarly, most American writers mention the actions in which the  privateers were victorious, but do not mention those in which they  were defeated; while the British, in turn, record every successful  \"cutting-out\" expedition, but ignore entirely those which terminated  unfavorably. Other errors arise from honest ignorance. Thus, James  in speaking of the repulse of the _Endymion's_ boats by the  _Neufchatel_ gives the latter a crew of 120 men; she had more than  this number originally, but only 40 were in her at the time of the  attack. So also when the captain of the _Pelican_ writes that the  officers of the _Argus_ report her loss at 40, when they really  reported it at 24 or when Captain Dacres thought the _Constitution_  had lost about 20 men instead of 14. The American gun-boat captains  in recounting their engagements with the British frigates invariably  greatly overestimated the loss of the latter. So that on both sides  there were some intentional misstatements or garblings, and a much  more numerous class of simple blunders, arising largely from an  incapacity for seeing more than one side of the question.    Among the early British writers upon this war, the ablest was  James. He devoted one work, his \"Naval Occurrences,\" entirely to  it; and it occupies the largest part of the sixth volume of his more  extensive \"History of the British Navy.\" [Footnote: A new edition,  London, 1826.] Two other British writers, Lieutenant Marshall  [Footnote: \"Royal Naval Biography,\" by John Marshall (London,  1823-1835).] and Captain Brenton, [Footnote: \"Naval History of  Great Britain,\" by Edward Pelham Brenton (new edition, London,  1837).] wrote histories of the same events, about the same time;  but neither of these naval officers produced half as valuable a  work as did the civilian James. Marshall wrote a dozen volumes,  each filled with several scores of dreary panegyrics, or memoirs  of as many different officers. There is no attempt at order, hardly  any thing about the ships, guns, or composition of the crews; and  not even the pretence of giving both sides, the object being to  make every Englishman appear in his best light. The work is  analogous to the numerous lives of Decatur, Bainbridge, Porter,  etc., that appeared in the United States about the same time, and  is quite as untrustworthy. Brenton made a far better and very  interesting book, written on a good and well-connected plan, and  apparently with a sincere desire to tell the truth. He accepts the  British official accounts as needing nothing whatever to supplement  them, precisely as Cooper accepts the American officials'. A more  serious fault is his inability to be accurate. That this inaccuracy  is not intentional is proved by the fact that it tells as often  against his own side as against his opponents. He says, for example,  that the guns of Perry's and Barclay's squadrons \"were about equal  in number and weight,\" that the _Peacock_ (British) was armed with  32's instead of 24's, and underestimates the force of the second  _Wasp_. But the blunders are quite as bad when distributed as when  confined to one side; in addition, Brenton's disregard of all  details makes him of but little use.    James, as already said, is by far the most valuable authority on  the war, as regards _purely British_ affairs. He enters minutely  into details, and has evidently laboriously hunted up his authorities.  He has examined the ships' logs, the Admiralty reports, various  treatises, all the _Gazette_ reports, gives very well-chosen  extracts, has arranged his work in chronological order, discriminates  between the officers that deserve praise and those that deserve  blame, and in fact writes a work which ought to be consulted by  every student of naval affairs. But he is unfortunately afflicted  with a hatred toward the Americans that amounts to a monomania. He  wishes to make out as strong a case as possible against them. The  _animus_ of his work may be gathered from the not over complimentary  account of the education of the youthful seafaring American, which  can be found in vol. vi, p. 113, of his \"History.\" On page 153 he  asserts that he is an \"impartial historian\"; and about three lines  before mentions that \"it may suit the Americans to invent any  falsehood, no matter how barefaced, to foist a valiant character  on themselves.\" On page 419 he says that Captain Porter is to be  believed, \"so far as is borne out by proof (the only safe way where  an American is concerned),\"--which somewhat sweeping denunciation  of the veracity of all of Captain Porter's compatriots would seem  to indicate that James was not, perhaps, in that dispassionate  frame of mind best suited for writing history. That he should be  biassed against individual captains can be understood, but when he  makes rabid onslaughts upon the American people as a whole, he  renders it difficult for an American, at any rate, to put implicit  credence in him. His statements are all the harder to confute  when they are erroneous, because they are intentionally so. It is  not, as with Brenton and Marshall, because he really thinks a  British captain _cannot_ be beaten, except by some kind of distorted  special providence, for no man says worse things than he does about  certain officers and crews. A writer of James' undoubted ability  must have known perfectly well that his statements were untrue in  many instances, as where he garbles Hilyar's account of Porter's  loss, or misstates the comparative force of the fleets on Lake  Champlain.    When he says (p. 194) that Captain Bainbridge wished to run  away from the _Java_, and would have done so if he had not been  withheld by the advice of his first lieutenant, who was a renegade  Englishman, [Footnote: Who, by the way, was Mr. Parker, born in  Virginia, and never in England in his life.] it is not of much  consequence whether his making the statement was due to excessive  credulity or petty meanness, for, in either case, whether the  defect was in his mind or his morals, it is enough to greatly  impair the value of his other \"facts.\" Again, when James (p. 165)  states that Decatur ran away from the _Macedonian_ until, by some  marvellous optical delusion, he mistook her for a 32, he merely  detracts a good deal from the worth of his own account. When the  Americans adopt boarding helmets, he considers it as proving  conclusively that they are suffering from an acute attack of  cowardice. On p. 122 he says that \"had the _President_, when she  fell in with the _Belvidera_, been cruising alone * * * Commodore  Rodgers would have magnified the British frigate into a line-of-battle  ship, and have done"]]]
