But by helping the Mahomedans  of India at a critical moment in their history, I want to buy their  friendship. Moreover, if I can carry the Mahomedans with me I hope to  wean Great Britain from the downward path along which the Prime Minister  seems to me to be taking her. I hope also to show to India and the  Empire at large that given a certain amount of capacity for  self-sacrifice, justice can be secured by peacefullest and cleanest  means without sowing or increasing bitterness between English and  Indians. For, whatever may be the temporary effect of my methods, I know  enough of them to feel certain that they alone are immune from lasting  bitterness. They are untainted with hatred, expedience or untruth.      IN PROCESS OF KEEPING    The writer of 'Current Topics' in the \"Times of India\" has attempted to  challenge the statement made in my Khilafat article regarding  ministerial pledges, and in doing so cites Mr. Asquith's Guild-Hall  speech of November 10, 1914. When I wrote the articles, I had in mind  Mr. Asquith's speech. I am sorry that he ever made that speech. For, in  my humble opinion, it betrayed to say the least, a confusion of thought.  Could he think of the Turkish people as apart from the Ottoman  Government? And what is the meaning of the death-knell of Ottoman  Dominion in Europe and Asia if it be not the death knell of Turkish  people as a free and governing race? Is it, again, true historically  that the Turkish rule has always been a blight that 'has withered some  of the fairest regions of the earth?' And what is the meaning of his  statement that followed, viz., \"Nothing is further from our thoughts  than to imitate or encourage a crusade against their belief?\" If words  have any meaning, the qualifications that Mr. Asquith introduced in his  speech should have meant a scrupulous regard for Indian Muslim feeling.  And if that be the meaning of his speech, without anything further to  support me I would claim that even Mr. Asquith's assurance is in danger  of being set at nought if the resolutions of the San Remo Conference are  to be crystallised into action. But I base remarks on a considered  speech made by Mr. Asquith's successor two years later when things had  assumed a more threatening shape than in 1914 and when the need for  Indian help was much greater than in 1914. His pledge would bear  repetition till it is fulfilled. He said: \"Nor are we fighting to  deprive Turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned lands of Asia  Minor and Thrace which are predominantly Turkish in race. We do not  challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the homelands of the  Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople.\" If only every word of  this pledge is fulfilled both in letter and in spirit, there would be  little left for quarrelling about. In so far as Mr. Asquith's  declaration can be considered hostile to the Indian Muslim claim, it its  superseded by the later and more considered declaration of Mr. Lloyd  George--a declaration made irrevocable by fulfilment of the  consideration it expected, viz. the enlistment of the brave Mahomedan  soldiery which fought in the very place which is now being partitioned  in spite of the pledge. But the writer of 'Current Topics' says Mr.  Lloyd George \"is now in process of keeping his pledge\" I hope he is  right. But what has already happened gives little ground for any such  hope. For, imprisonment or internment of the Khalif in his own capital  will be not only a mockery of fulfilment but it would he adding injury  to insult. Either the Turkish Empire is to be maintained in the  homelands of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople or it  is not. If it is, let the Indian Mahomedans feel the full glow of it or  if the Empire is to be broken up, let the mask of hypocrisy be lifted  and India see the truth in its nakedness. To join the Khilafat movement  then means to join a movement to keep inviolate the pledge of a British  minister. Surely, such a movement is worth much greater sacrifice than  may be involved in non-co-operation.      APPEAL TO THE VICEROY    Your Excellency.    As one who has enjoyed a certain measure of your Excellency's  confidence, and as one who claims to be a devoted well-wisher of the  British Empire, I owe it to your Excellency, and through your Excellency  to His Majesty's Ministers, to explain my connection with and my conduct  in the Khilafat question.    At the very earliest stages of the war, even whilst I was in London  organising the Indian Volunteer Ambulance Corps, I began to interest  myself in the Khilafat question. I perceived how deeply moved the little  Mussalman World in London was when Turkey decided to throw in her lot  with Germany. On my arrival in India in the January of 1915, I found the  same anxiousness and earnestness among the Mussalmans with whom I came  in contact. Their anxiety became intense when the information about the  Secret Treaties leaked out. Distrust of British intentions filled their  minds, and despair took possession of them. Even at that moment I  advised my Mussalman friends not to give way to despair, but to express  their fear and their hopes in a disciplined manner. It will be admitted  that the whole of Mussalman India has behaved in a singularly restrained  manner during the past five years and that the leaders have been able to  keep the turbulent sections of their community under complete control.    The peace terms and your Excellency's defence of them have given the  Mussalmans of India a shock from which it will be difficult for them to  recover. The terms violate ministerial pledges and utterly disregard  Mussalman sentiment. I consider that as a staunch Hindu wishing to live  on terms of the closest friendship with my Mussalman countrymen. I  should be an unworthy son of India if I did not stand by them in their  hour of trial. In my humble opinion their cause is just. They claim that  Turkey must be _punished_ if their sentiment is to be respected. Muslim  soldiers did fight to inflict punishment on their own Khalifa or to  deprive him of his territories. The Mussalman attitude has been  consistent, throughout these five years.    My duty to the Empire to which I owe my loyalty requires me to resist  the cruel violence that has been done to the Mussalman sentiment. So far  as I am aware, Mussulmans and Hindus have as a whole lost faith in  British justice and honour. The report of the majority of the Hunter  Committee, Your Excellency's despatch thereon and Mr. Montagu's reply  have only aggravated the distrust.    In these circumstances the only course open to one like me is either in  despair to sever all connection with British rule, or, if I still  retained faith in the inherent superiority of the British constitution  to all others at present in vogue to adopt such means as will rectify  the wrong done, and thus restore confidence. I have not lost faith in  such superiority and I am not without hope that somehow or other justice  will yet be rendered if we show the requisite capacity for suffering.  Indeed, my conception of that constitution is that it helps only those  who are ready to help themselves. I do not believe that it protects the  weak. It gives free scope to the strong to maintain their strength and  develop it. The weak under it go to the wall.    It is, then, because I believe in the British constitution that I have  advised my Mussalman friends to withdraw their support from your  Excellency's Government and the Hindus to join them, should the peace  terms not be revised in accordance with the solemn pledges of Ministers  and the Muslim sentiment.    Three courses were open to the Mahomedans in order to mark their  emphatic disapproval of the utter injustice to which His Majesty's  Ministers have become party, if they have not actually been the prime  perpetrators of it. They are:--    (1) To resort to violence,    (2) To advise emigration on a wholesale scale,    (3) Not to be party to the injustice by ceasing to co-operate with the  Government.    Your Excellency must be aware that there was a time when the boldest,  though the most thoughtless among the Mussulmans favoured violence, and  the \"Hijrat\" (emigration) has not yet ceased to be the battle-cry. I  venture to claim that I have succeeded by patient reasoning in weaning  the party of violence from its ways. I confess that I did not--I did not  attempt to succeed in weaning them from violence on moral grounds, but  purely on utilitarian grounds. The result, for the time being at any  has, however, been to stop violence. The School of \"Hijrat\" has received  a check, if it has not stopped its activity entirely. I hold that no  repression could have prevented a violent eruption, if the people had  not had presented to them a form of direct action involving considerable  sacrifice and ensuring success if such direct action was largely taken  up by the public. Non-co-operation was the only dignified and  constitutional form of such direct action. For it is the right  recognised from times immemorial of the subject to refuse to assist a  ruler who misrules.    At the same time I admit that non-co-operation practised by the mass of  people is attended with grave risks. But, in a crisis such as has  overtaken the Mussalmans of India, no step that is unattended with large  risks, can possibly bring about the desired change. Not to run some  risks now will be to court much greater risks if not virtual destruction  of Law and Order.    But there is yet an escape from non-co-operation. The Mussalman  representation has requested your Excellency to lead the agitation  yourself, as did your distinguished predecessor at the time of the South  African trouble. But if you cannot see your way to do so, and  non-co-op"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#8)"],[1,"any of the noisy  wrangling before the contest began. The slurs against the Indian that  stained the lips of our opponents were already burning like a dry fever  within my breast.    But after the orations were delivered a deeper burn awaited me. There,  before that vast ocean of eyes, some college rowdies threw out a large  white flag, with a drawing of a most forlorn Indian girl on it. Under  this they had printed in bold black letters words that ridiculed the  college which was represented by a \"squaw.\" Such worse than barbarian  rudeness embittered me. While we waited for the verdict of the judges, I  gleamed fiercely upon the throngs of palefaces. My teeth were hard set,  as I saw the white flag still floating insolently in the air.    Then anxiously we watched the man carry toward the stage the envelope  containing the final decision.    There were two prizes given, that night, and one of them was mine!    The evil spirit laughed within me when the white flag dropped out of  sight, and the hands which hurled it hung limp in defeat.    Leaving the crowd as quickly as possible, I was soon in my room. The  rest of the night I sat in an armchair and gazed into the crackling  fire. I laughed no more in triumph when thus alone. The little taste of  victory did not satisfy a hunger in my heart. In my mind I saw my mother  far away on the Western plains, and she was holding a charge against me.          AN INDIAN TEACHER AMONG INDIANS    I.    MY FIRST DAY.      Though an illness left me unable to continue my college course, my pride  kept me from returning to my mother. Had she known of my worn condition,  she would have said the white man's papers were not worth the freedom  and health I had lost by them. Such a rebuke from my mother would have  been unbearable, and as I felt then it would be far too true to be  comfortable.    Since the winter when I had my first dreams about red apples I had been  traveling slowly toward the morning horizon. There had been no doubt  about the direction in which I wished to go to spend my energies in a  work for the Indian race. Thus I had written my mother briefly, saying  my plan for the year was to teach in an Eastern Indian school. Sending  this message to her in the West, I started at once eastward.    Thus I found myself, tired and hot, in a black veiling of car smoke, as  I stood wearily on a street corner of an old-fashioned town, waiting  for a car. In a few moments more I should be on the school grounds,  where a new work was ready for my inexperienced hands.    Upon entering the school campus, I was surprised at the thickly  clustered buildings which made it a quaint little village, much more  interesting than the town itself. The large trees among the houses gave  the place a cool, refreshing shade, and the grass a deeper green. Within  this large court of grass and trees stood a low green pump. The queer  boxlike case had a revolving handle on its side, which clanked and  creaked constantly.    I made myself known, and was shown to my room,--a small, carpeted room,  with ghastly walls and ceiling. The two windows, both on the same side,  were curtained with heavy muslin yellowed with age. A clean white bed  was in one corner of the room, and opposite it was a square pine table  covered with a black woolen blanket.    Without removing my hat from my head, I seated myself in one of the two  stiff-backed chairs that were placed beside the table. For several heart  throbs I sat still looking from ceiling to floor, from wall to wall,  trying hard to imagine years of contentment there. Even while I was  wondering if my exhausted strength would sustain me through this  undertaking, I heard a heavy tread stop at my door. Opening it, I met  the imposing figure of a stately gray-haired man. With a light straw hat  in one hand, and the right hand extended for greeting, he smiled kindly  upon me. For some reason I was awed by his wondrous height and his  strong square shoulders, which I felt were a finger's length above my  head.    I was always slight, and my serious illness in the early spring had made  me look rather frail and languid. His quick eye measured my height and  breadth. Then he looked into my face. I imagined that a visible shadow  flitted across his countenance as he let my hand fall. I knew he was no  other than my employer.    \"Ah ha! so you are the little Indian girl who created the excitement  among the college orators!\" he said, more to himself than to me. I  thought I heard a subtle note of disappointment in his voice. Looking in  from where he stood, with one sweeping glance, he asked if I lacked  anything for my room.    After he turned to go, I listened to his step until it grew faint and  was lost in the distance. I was aware that my car-smoked appearance had  not concealed the lines of pain on my face.    For a short moment my spirit laughed at my ill fortune, and I  entertained the idea of exerting myself to make an improvement. But as I  tossed my hat off a leaden weakness came over me, and I felt as if years  of weariness lay like water-soaked logs upon me. I threw myself upon the  bed, and, closing my eyes, forgot my good intention.          II.    A TRIP WESTWARD.      One sultry month I sat at a desk heaped up with work. Now, as I recall  it, I wonder how I could have dared to disregard nature's warning with  such recklessness. Fortunately, my inheritance of a marvelous endurance  enabled me to bend without breaking.    Though I had gone to and fro, from my room to the office, in an unhappy  silence, I was watched by those around me. On an early morning I was  summoned to the superintendent's office. For a half-hour I listened to  his words, and when I returned to my room I remembered one sentence  above the rest. It was this: \"I am going to turn you loose to pasture!\"  He was sending me West to gather Indian pupils for the school, and this  was his way of expressing it.    I needed nourishment, but the midsummer's travel across the continent to  search the hot prairies for overconfident parents who would entrust  their children to strangers was a lean pasturage. However, I dwelt on  the hope of seeing my mother. I tried to reason that a change was a  rest. Within a couple of days I started toward my mother's home.    The intense heat and the sticky car smoke that followed my homeward  trail did not noticeably restore my vitality. Hour after hour I gazed  upon the country which was receding rapidly from me. I noticed the  gradual expansion of the horizon as we emerged out of the forests into  the plains. The great high buildings, whose towers overlooked the dense  woodlands, and whose gigantic clusters formed large cities, diminished,  together with the groves, until only little log cabins lay snugly in the  bosom of the vast prairie. The cloud shadows which drifted about on the  waving yellow of long-dried grasses thrilled me like the meeting of old  friends.    At a small station, consisting of a single frame house with a rickety  board walk around it, I alighted from the iron horse, just thirty miles  from my mother and my brother Dawee. A strong hot wind seemed determined  to blow my hat off, and return me to olden days when I roamed bareheaded  over the hills. After the puffing engine of my train was gone, I stood  on the platform in deep solitude. In the distance I saw the gently  rolling land leap up into bare hills. At their bases a broad gray road  was winding itself round about them until it came by the station. Among  these hills I rode in a light conveyance, with a trusty driver, whose  unkempt flaxen hair hung shaggy about his ears and his leather neck of  reddish tan. From accident or decay he had lost one of his long front  teeth.    Though I call him a paleface, his cheeks were of a brick red. His moist  blue eyes, blurred and bloodshot, twitched involuntarily. For a long  time he had driven through grass and snow from this solitary station to  the Indian village. His weather-stained clothes fitted badly his warped  shoulders. He was stooped, and his protruding chin, with its tuft of dry  flax, nodded as monotonously as did the head of his faithful beast.    All the morning I looked about me, recognizing old familiar sky lines of  rugged bluffs and round-topped hills. By the roadside I caught glimpses  of various plants whose sweet roots were delicacies among my people.  When I saw the first cone-shaped wigwam, I could not help uttering an  exclamation which caused my driver a sudden jump out of his drowsy  nodding.    At noon, as we drove through the eastern edge of the reservation, I grew  very impatient and restless. Constantly I wondered what my mother would  say upon seeing her little daughter grown tall. I had not written her  the day of my arrival, thinking I would surprise her. Crossing a ravine  thicketed with low shrubs and plum bushes, we approached a large yellow  acre of wild sunflowers. Just beyond this nature's garden we drew near  to my mother's cottage. Close by the log cabin stood a little  canvas-covered wigwam. The driver stopped in front of the open door, and  in a long moment my mother appeared at the threshold.    I had expected her to run out to greet me, but she stood still, all the  while staring at the weather-beaten man at my side. At length, when her  loftiness became unbearable, I called to her, \"Mother, why do you stop?\"    This seemed to break the evil moment, and she hastened out to hold my  head against her cheek.    \"My daughter, what madness possessed you to bring home such a fellow?\"  she asked, pointing at the driver, who was fumbling in his pockets for  change while he held the bill I gave him between his jagged teeth.    \"Bring him! Why, no, mother, he has brought me! He is a driver!\" I  exclaimed.    Upon this revelation, my mother threw her arms about me and apologized  for her mistaken inference. We laughed away the momentary hurt. Then she  built a brisk fire on the ground"]]]
