One of the most engaging and inspiring of these  ideas is that the personal self is a _projection_ on the plane of  materiality of a metaphysical self, or soul, to which the personal  self is related as is the shadow of an object to the object  itself. Now this coincides remarkably with the idea implicit in all  higher-space speculation, that the figures of solid geometry  are projections on a space of three dimensions, of corresponding  four-dimensional forms.    All ornament is in its last analysis geometrical--sometimes directly  so, as in the system developed by the Moors. Will the psychology  of the new dispensation find expression through some adaptation of  four-dimensional geometry? The idea is far from absurd, by reason of  the decorative quality inherent in many of the regular hypersolids of  four-dimensional space when projected upon solid and plane space.    If this suggestion seems too fanciful, there is still recourse to the  law of analogy in finding the thing we seek. Every fresh religious  impulse has always developed a symbology through which its truths are  expressed and handed down. These symbols, woven into the very texture  of the life of the people, are embodied by them in their ornamental  mode. The sculpture of a Greek temple is a picture-book of Greek  religion; the ornamentation of a Gothic cathedral is a veritable bible  of the Christian faith. Almost all of the most beautiful and enduring  ornaments have first been sacred symbols; the swastika, the \"Eye of  Buddha,\" the \"Shield of David,\" the wheel, the lotus, and the cross.    Now that \"twilight of the world\" following the war perhaps will  witness an _Avatara_--the coming of a World-Teacher who will rebuild  on the one broad and ancient foundation that temple of Truth which  the folly and ignorance of man is ever tearing down. A material  counterpart of that temple will in that case afterward arise. Thus  will be born the architecture of the future; and the ornament of that  architecture will tell, in a new set of symbols, the story of the  rejuvenation of the world.    In this previsioning of architecture after the war, the author  must not be understood to mean that these things will be realized  _directly_ after. Architecture, from its very nature, is the most  sluggish of all the arts to respond to the natural magic of the  quick-moving mind--it is Caliban, not Ariel. Following the war the  nation will be for a time depleted of man-power, burdened with  debt, prostrate, exhausted. But in that time of reckoning will come  reflection, penitence.                \"And I'll be wise hereafter,    And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass    Was I, to take this drunkard for a god,    And worship this dull fool.\"    With some such epilogue the curtain will descend on the great drama  now approaching a close. It will be for the younger generations, the  reincarnate souls of those who fell in battle, to inaugurate the work  of giving expression, in deathless forms of art, to the vision of that  \"fairer world\" glimpsed now only as by lightning, in a dream.    [Illustration]          ESSAYS          ORNAMENT FROM MATHEMATICS    I    THE WORLD ORDER      No fact is better established than that we live in an _orderly_  universe. The truth of this the world-war may for the moment, and to  the near and narrow view appear to contradict, but the sweep of human  history, and the stars in their courses, show an orderliness which  cannot be gainsaid.    Now of that order, _number_--that is, mathematics--is the more than  symbol, it is the very thing itself. Whence this weltering tide of  life arose, and whither it flows, we know not; but that it is governed  by mathematical law all of our knowledge in every field confirms. Were  it not so, knowledge itself would be impossible. It is because man is  a counting animal that he is master over all the beasts of the earth.    Number is the tune to which all things move, and as it were make  music; it is in the pulses of the blood no less than in the starred  curtain of the sky. It is a necessary concomitant alike of the sharp  bargain, the chemical experiment, and the fine frenzy of the poet.  Music is number made audible; architecture is number made visible;  nature geometrizes not alone in her crystals, but in her most  intricate arabesques.    If number be indeed the universal solvent of all forms, sounds,  motions, may we not make of it the basis of a new aesthetic--a loom on  which to weave patterns the like of which the world has never seen? To  attempt such a thing--to base art on mathematics--argues (some one  is sure to say) an entire misconception of the nature and function of  art. \"Art is a fountain of spontaneous emotion\"--what, therefore,  can it have in common with the proverbially driest, least spontaneous  preoccupation of the human mind? But the above definition concludes  with the assertion that this emotion reaches the soul \"through various  channels.\" The transit can be effected only through some sensuous  element, some language (in the largest sense), and into this the  element of number and form must inevitably enter--mathematics is  \"there\" and cannot be thought or argued away.    [Illustration: PLATE XI. IMAGINARY COMPOSITION: THE PORTAL]    But to make mathematics, and not the emotion which it expresses, the  important thing, is not this to fall into the time-worn heresy of  art for art's sake, that is, art for form's sake--art for the sake of  mathematics? To this objection there is an answer, and as this answer  contains the crux of the whole matter, embraces the proposition by  which this thesis must stand or fall, it must be full and clear.    What is it, in the last analysis, that all art which is not  purely personal and episodical strives to express? Is it not the  _world-order_?--the very thing that religion, philosophy, science,  strive according to their different natures and methods to express?  The perception of the world-order by the artist arouses an emotion to  which he can give vent only in terms of number; but number is itself  the most abstract expression of the world order. The form and content  of art are therefore not different, but the same. A deep sense of this  probably inspired Pater's famous saying that all art aspires toward  the condition of music; for music, from its very nature, is the  world-order uttered in terms of number, in a sense and to a degree not  attained by any other art.    This is not mere verbal juggling. We have suffered so long from an  art-phase which exalts the personal, as opposed to the cosmic, that  we have lost sight of the fact that the great arts of antiquity,  preceding the Renaissance, insisted on the cosmic, or impersonal  aspect, and on this alone, just as does Oriental art, even today.  The secret essence, the archetypal idea of the subject is the  preoccupation of the Oriental artist, as it was of the Egyptian,  and of the Greek. We of the West today seek as eagerly to fix the  accidental and ephemeral aspect--the shadow of a particular cloud upon  a particular landscape; the smile on the face of a specific person, in  a recognizable room, at a particular moment of time. Of symbolic art,  of universal emotion expressing itself in terms which are universal,  we have very little to show.    The reason for this is first, our love for, and understanding of,  the concrete and personal: it is the _world-aspect_ and not the  _world-order_ which interests us; and second, the inadequacies of  current forms of art expression to render our sense of the eternal  secret heart of things as it presents itself to our young eyes.  Confronted with this difficulty, we have shirked it, and our ambition  has shrunk to the portrayal of those aspects which shuffle our poverty  out of sight. It is not a poverty of technique--we are dexterous  enough; nor is it a poverty of invention--we are clever enough; it is  the poverty of the spiritual bankrupt trying to divert attention by a  prodigal display of the smallest of small change.    Reference is made here only to the arts of space; the arts of  time--music, poetry, and the (written) drama--employing vehicles more  flexible, have been more fortunate, though they too suffer in some  degree from worshipping, instead of the god of order, the god of  chance.    The corrective of this is a return to first principles: principles so  fundamental that they suffer no change, however new and various their  illustrations. These principles are embodied in number, and one might  almost say nowhere else in such perfection. Mathematics is not the  dry and deadly thing that our teaching of it and the uses we put it  to have made it seem. Mathematics is the handwriting on the human  consciousness of the very Spirit of Life itself. Others before  Pythagoras discovered this, and it is the discovery which awaits us  too.    To indicate the way in which mathematics might be made to yield the  elements of a new aesthetic is beyond the province of this essay, being  beyond the compass of its author, but he makes bold to take a single  phase: ornament, and to deal with it from this point of view.    The ornament now in common use has been gathered from the dust-bin  of the ages. What ornamental _motif_ of any universality, worth, or  importance is less than a hundred years old? We continue to use the  honeysuckle, the acanthus, the fret, the egg and dart, not because  they are appropriate to any use we put them to, but because they are  beautiful _per se_. Why are they beautiful? It is not because they  are highly conventionalized representations of natural forms which  are themselves beautiful, but because they express cosmic truths. The  honeysuckle and the acanthus leaf, for example, express the idea  of successive impulses, mounting, attaining a maximum, and  descending--expanding from some focus of force in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#8)"],[1,"iences, which I have had time and again as  a field student of American Indian languages, are very neatly confirmed  by personal experiences of another sort. Twice I have taught intelligent  young Indians to write their own languages according to the phonetic  system which I employ. They were taught merely how to render accurately  the sounds as such. Both had some difficulty in learning to break up a  word into its constituent sounds, but none whatever in determining the  words. This they both did with spontaneous and complete accuracy. In the  hundreds of pages of manuscript Nootka text that I have obtained from  one of these young Indians the words, whether abstract relational  entities like English _that_ and _but_ or complex sentence-words like  the Nootka example quoted above, are, practically without exception,  isolated precisely as I or any other student would have isolated them.  Such experiences with naive speakers and recorders do more to convince  one of the definitely plastic unity of the word than any amount of  purely theoretical argument.]    It is easier to ask the question than to answer it. The best that we can  do is to say that the word is one of the smallest, completely satisfying  bits of isolated \"meaning\" into which the sentence resolves itself. It  cannot be cut into without a disturbance of meaning, one or the other or  both of the severed parts remaining as a helpless waif on our hands. In  practice this unpretentious criterion does better service than might be  supposed. In such a sentence as _It is unthinkable_, it is simply  impossible to group the elements into any other and smaller \"words\" than  the three indicated. _Think_ or _thinkable_ might be isolated, but as  neither _un-_ nor _-able_ nor _is-un_ yields a measurable satisfaction,  we are compelled to leave _unthinkable_ as an integral whole, a  miniature bit of art. Added to the \"feel\" of the word are frequently,  but by no means invariably, certain external phonetic characteristics.  Chief of these is accent. In many, perhaps in most, languages the single  word is marked by a unifying accent, an emphasis on one of the  syllables, to which the rest are subordinated. The particular syllable  that is to be so distinguished is dependent, needless to say, on the  special genius of the language. The importance of accent as a unifying  feature of the word is obvious in such English examples as  _unthinkable_, _characterizing_. The long Paiute word that we have  analyzed is marked as a rigid phonetic unit by several features, chief  of which are the accent on its second syllable (_wii'_-\"knife\") and the  slurring (\"unvoicing,\" to use the technical phonetic term) of its final  vowel (_-mue_, animate plural). Such features as accent, cadence, and the  treatment of consonants and vowels within the body of a word are often  useful as aids in the external demarcation of the word, but they must by  no means be interpreted, as is sometimes done, as themselves responsible  for its psychological existence. They at best but strengthen a feeling  of unity that is already present on other grounds.    We have already seen that the major functional unit of speech, the  sentence, has, like the word, a psychological as well as a merely  logical or abstracted existence. Its definition is not difficult. It is  the linguistic expression of a proposition. It combines a subject of  discourse with a statement in regard to this subject. Subject and  \"predicate\" may be combined in a single word, as in Latin _dico_; each  may be expressed independently, as in the English equivalent, _I say_;  each or either may be so qualified as to lead to complex propositions of  many sorts. No matter how many of these qualifying elements (words or  functional parts of words) are introduced, the sentence does not lose  its feeling of unity so long as each and every one of them falls in  place as contributory to the definition of either the subject of  discourse or the core of the predicate[7]. Such a sentence as _The mayor  of New York is going to deliver a speech of welcome in French_ is  readily felt as a unified statement, incapable of reduction by the  transfer of certain of its elements, in their given form, to the  preceding or following sentences. The contributory ideas of _of New  York_, _of welcome_, and _in French_ may be eliminated without hurting  the idiomatic flow of the sentence. _The mayor is going to deliver a  speech_ is a perfectly intelligible proposition. But further than this  we cannot go in the process of reduction. We cannot say, for instance,  _Mayor is going to deliver_.[8] The reduced sentence resolves itself  into the subject of discourse--_the mayor_--and the predicate--_is going  to deliver a speech_. It is customary to say that the true subject of  such a sentence is _mayor_, the true predicate _is going_ or even _is_,  the other elements being strictly subordinate. Such an analysis,  however, is purely schematic and is without psychological value. It is  much better frankly to recognize the fact that either or both of the two  terms of the sentence-proposition may be incapable of expression in the  form of single words. There are languages that can convey all that is  conveyed by _The-mayor is-going-to-deliver-a-speech_ in two words, a  subject word and a predicate word, but English is not so highly  synthetic. The point that we are really making here is that underlying  the finished sentence is a living sentence type, of fixed formal  characteristics. These fixed types or actual sentence-groundworks may be  freely overlaid by such additional matter as the speaker or writer cares  to put on, but they are themselves as rigidly \"given\" by tradition as  are the radical and grammatical elements abstracted from the finished  word. New words may be consciously created from these fundamental  elements on the analogy of old ones, but hardly new types of words. In  the same way new sentences are being constantly created, but always on  strictly traditional lines. The enlarged sentence, however, allows as a  rule of considerable freedom in the handling of what may be called  \"unessential\" parts. It is this margin of freedom which gives us the  opportunity of individual style.    [Footnote 7: \"Coordinate sentences\" like _I shall remain but you may go_  may only doubtfully be considered as truly unified predications, as true  sentences. They are sentences in a stylistic sense rather than from the  strictly formal linguistic standpoint. The orthography _I shall remain.  But you may go_ is as intrinsically justified as _I shall remain. Now  you may go_. The closer connection in sentiment between the first two  propositions has led to a conventional visual representation that must  not deceive the analytic spirit.]    [Footnote 8: Except, possibly, in a newspaper headline. Such headlines,  however, are language only in a derived sense.]    The habitual association of radical elements, grammatical elements,  words, and sentences with concepts or groups of concepts related into  wholes is the fact itself of language. It is important to note that  there is in all languages a certain randomness of association. Thus, the  idea of \"hide\" may be also expressed by the word \"conceal,\" the notion  of \"three times\" also by \"thrice.\" The multiple expression of a single  concept is universally felt as a source of linguistic strength and  variety, not as a needless extravagance. More irksome is a random  correspondence between idea and linguistic expression in the field of  abstract and relational concepts, particularly when the concept is  embodied in a grammatical element. Thus, the randomness of the  expression of plurality in such words as _books_, _oxen_, _sheep_, and  _geese_ is felt to be rather more, I fancy, an unavoidable and  traditional predicament than a welcome luxuriance. It is obvious that a  language cannot go beyond a certain point in this randomness. Many  languages go incredibly far in this respect, it is true, but linguistic  history shows conclusively that sooner or later the less frequently  occurring associations are ironed out at the expense of the more vital  ones. In other words, all languages have an inherent tendency to economy  of expression. Were this tendency entirely inoperative, there would be  no grammar. The fact of grammar, a universal trait of language, is  simply a generalized expression of the feeling that analogous concepts  and relations are most conveniently symbolized in analogous forms. Were  a language ever completely \"grammatical,\" it would be a perfect engine  of conceptual expression. Unfortunately, or luckily, no language is  tyrannically consistent. All grammars leak.    Up to the present we have been assuming that the material of language  reflects merely the world of concepts and, on what I have ventured to  call the \"pre-rational\" plane, of images, which are the raw material of  concepts. We have, in other words, been assuming that language moves  entirely in the ideational or cognitive sphere. It is time that we  amplified the picture. The volitional aspect of consciousness also is to  some extent explicitly provided for in language. Nearly all languages  have special means for the expression of commands (in the imperative  forms of the verb, for example) and of desires, unattained or  unattainable (_Would he might come!_ or _Would he were here!_) The  emotions, on the whole, seem to be given a less adequate outlet.  Emotion, indeed, is proverbially inclined to speechlessness. Most, if  not all, the interjections are to be put to the credit of emotional  expression, also, it may be, a number of linguistic elements expressing  certain modalities, such as dubitative or potential forms, which may be  interpreted as reflecting the emotional states of hesitation or  doubt--attenuated fear. On the whole, it must be admitted that ideation  reigns supreme in language, that volition and emotion come in as"]]]
