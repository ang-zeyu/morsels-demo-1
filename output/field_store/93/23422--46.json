The paper may be  gilt-edged, but not coloured. The sealing-wax used should be of some  delicate hue.    An invitation to a ball should be sent out at least ten days before  the evening appointed. A fortnight, three weeks, and even a month may  be allowed in the way of notice.    Not more than two or three days should be permitted to elapse before  you reply to an invitation of this kind. The reply should always be  addressed to the lady of the house, and should be couched in the same  person as the invitation. The following are the forms generally in use:--        Mrs. Molyneux requests the honour of Captain Hamilton's      company at an evening party, on Monday, March the 11th      instant. _Dancing will begin at Nine o'clock_. Thursday, March      1st.           *       *       *       *       *        Captain Hamilton has much pleasure in accepting Mrs.      Molyneux's polite invitation for Monday evening, March the      11th instant. Friday, March 2nd.    The old form of \"presenting compliments\" is now out of fashion.    The lady who gives a ball[A] should endeavour to secure an equal  number of dancers of both sexes. Many private parties are spoiled by  the preponderance of young ladies, some of whom never get partners at  all, unless they dance with each other.    A room should in all cases be provided for the accommodation of  the ladies. In this room there ought to be several looking-glasses;  attendants to assist the fair visitors in the arrangement of their  hair and dress; and some place in which the cloaks and shawls can be  laid in order, and found at a moment's notice. It is well to affix  tickets to the cloaks, giving a duplicate at the same time to each  lady, as at the public theatres and concert-rooms. Needles and thread  should also be at hand, to repair any little accident incurred in  dancing.    Another room should be devoted to refreshments, and kept amply  supplied with coffee, lemonade, ices, wine, and biscuits during the  evening. Where this cannot be arranged, the refreshments should be  handed round between the dances.    The question of supper is one which so entirely depends on the means  of those who give a ball or evening party, that very little can be  said upon it in a treatise of this description. Where money is no  object, it is of course always preferable to have the whole supper,  \"with all appliances and means to boot,\" sent in from some first-rate  house. It spares all trouble whether to the entertainers or  their servants, and relieves the hostess of every anxiety. Where  circumstances render such a course imprudent, we would only observe  that a home-provided supper, however simple, should be good of its  kind, and abundant in quantity. Dancers are generally hungry people,  and feel themselves much aggrieved if the supply of sandwiches proves  unequal to the demand. Great inconvenience is often experienced  through the difficulty of procuring cabs at the close of an evening  party. Gentlemen who have been dancing, and are unprepared for  walking, object to go home on foot, or seek vehicles for their wives  and daughters. Female servants who have been in attendance upon the  visitors during a whole evening ought not to be sent out. If even  men-servants are kept, they may find it difficult to procure as many  cabs as are necessary. The best thing that the giver of a private  ball can do under these circumstances, is to engage a policeman with  a lanthorn to attend on the pavement during the evening, and to give  notice during the morning at a neighbouring cab-stand, so as to ensure  a sufficient number of vehicles at the time when they are likely to be  required.    A ball generally begins about half-past nine or ten o'clock.    To attempt to dance without a knowledge of dancing is not only to make  one's self ridiculous, but one's partner also. No lady has a right  to place a partner in this absurd position. Never forget a ball-room  engagement. To do so is to commit an unpardonable offence against good  breeding.    On entering the ball-room, the visitor should at once seek the lady  of the house, and pay her respects to her. Having done this, she may  exchange salutations with such friends and acquaintances as may be in  the room.    No lady should accept an invitation to dance from a gentleman to whom  she has not been introduced. In case any gentleman should commit the  error of so inviting her, she should not excuse herself on the plea of  a previous engagement, or of fatigue, as to do so would imply that  she did not herself attach due importance to the necessary ceremony  of introduction. Her best reply would be to the effect that she would  have much pleasure in accepting his invitation, if he would procure an  introduction to her. This observation may be taken as applying only to  public balls. At a private party the host and hostess are sufficient  guarantees for the respectability of their guests; and although a  gentleman would show a singular want of knowledge of the laws of  society in acting as we have supposed, the lady who should reply  to him as if he were merely an impertinent stranger in a public  assembly-room would be implying an affront to her entertainers. The  mere fact of being assembled together under the roof of a mutual  friend is in itself a kind of general introduction of the guests to  each other.    An introduction given for the mere purpose of enabling a lady and  gentleman to go through a dance together does not constitute an  acquaintanceship. The lady is at liberty to pass the gentleman in the  park the next day without recognition.    It is not necessary that a lady should be acquainted with the _steps_,  in order to walk gracefully and easily through a quadrille. An easy  carriage and a knowledge of the figure is all that is requisite. A  round dance, however, should on no account be attempted without a  thorough knowledge of the steps, and some previous practice.    No person who has not a good ear for time and tune need hope to dance  well.    No lady should accept refreshments from a stranger at a public ball;  for she would thereby lay herself under a pecuniary obligation. For  these she must rely on her father, brothers, or old friends.    Good taste forbids that a lady should dance too frequently with the  same partner at either a public or private ball.    Engaged persons should be careful not to commit this conspicuous  solecism.    Engagements for one dance should not be made while the present dance  is yet in progress.    Never attempt to take a place in a dance which has been previously  engaged.    Withdraw from a private ball-room as quietly as possible, so that your  departure may not be observed by others, and cause the party to break  up. If you meet the lady of the house on your way out, take your leave  of her in such a manner that her other guests may not suppose you are  doing so; but do not seek her out for that purpose.    Never be seen without gloves in a ball-room, though it were for only  a few moments. Ladies who dance much and are particularly _soigne_  in matters relating to the toilette, take a second pair of gloves to  replace the first when soiled.    A thoughtful hostess will never introduce a bad dancer to a good  one, because she has no right to punish one friend in order to oblige  another.    It is not customary for married persons to dance together in society.

A visitor is bound by the laws of social intercourse to conform in all  respects to the habits of the house. In order to do this effectually,  she should inquire, or cause her personal servant to inquire, what  those habits are. To keep your friend's breakfast on the table till a  late hour; to delay the dinner by want of punctuality; to accept other  invitations, and treat his house as if it were merely an hotel to  be slept in; or to keep the family up till unwonted hours, are alike  evidences of a want of good feeling and good breeding.    At breakfast and lunch absolute punctuality is not imperative; but a  visitor should avoid being always the last to appear at table.    No order of precedence is observed at either breakfast or luncheon.  Persons take their seats as they come in, and, having exchanged their  morning salutations, begin to eat without waiting for the rest of the  party.    If letters are delivered to you at breakfast or luncheon, you may read  them by asking permission from the lady who presides at the urn.    Always hold yourself at the disposal of those in whose house you are  visiting. If they propose to ride, drive, walk, or otherwise occupy  the day, you may take it for granted that these plans are made with  reference to your enjoyment. You should, therefore, receive them with  cheerfulness, enter into them with alacrity, and do your best to seem  pleased, and be pleased, by the efforts which your friends make to  entertain you.    You should never take a book from the library to your own room without  requesting permission to borrow it. When it is lent, you should take  every care that it sustains no injury while in your possession, and  should cover it, if necessary.    A guest should endeavour to amuse herself as much as possible, and not  be continually dependent on her hosts for entertainment. She should  remember that, however welcome she may be, she is not always wanted.    Those who receive \"staying visitors,\" as they are called, should  remember that the truest hospitality is that which places the visitor  most at her ease, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12428"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#8)"],[1,"you, who pretend to judge of  another man's happiness; that state, which each man under the guidance of  his Maker forms for himself, and not one man for another? To know what  constitutes mine or your happiness is the sole prerogative of him who  created us, and cast us in so various and different moulds. Did your slaves  ever complain to you of their unhappiness amidst their native woods and  deserts? or rather let me ask, Did they ever cease complaining of their  condition under you their lordly masters, where they see indeed the  accommodations of civil life, but see them all pass to others, themselves  unbenefited by them? Be so gracious then, ye petty tyrants over human  freedom, to let your slaves judge for themselves, what it is which makes  their own happiness, and then see whether they do not place it in the  return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your  grandeur, of which their misery makes so large a part; a return so  passionately longed for, that, despairing of happiness here, that is, of  escaping the chains of their cruel taskmasters, they console themselves  with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven, in their future  state\"--    About this time certain cruel and wicked practices, which must now be  mentioned, had arrived at such a height, and had become so frequent in the  metropolis, as to produce of themselves other coadjutors to the cause.    Before the year 1700, planters, merchants, and others, resident in the West  Indies, but coming to England, were accustomed to bring with them certain  slaves to act as servants with them during their stay. The latter, seeing  the freedom and the happiness of servants in this country, and considering  what would be their own hard fate on their return to the islands,  frequently absconded. Their masters of course made search after them, and  often had them seized and carried away by force. It was, however, thrown  out by many on these occasions, that the English laws did not sanction such  proceedings, for that all persons who were baptized became free. The  consequence of this was, that most of the slaves, who came over with their  masters, prevailed upon some pious clergyman to baptize them. They took of  course godfathers of such citizens as had the generosity to espouse their  cause. When they were seized they usually sent to these, if they had an  opportunity, for their protection. And in the result, their godfathers,  maintaining that they had been baptized, and that they were free on this  account as well as by the general tenour of the laws of England, dared  those, who had taken possession of them, to send them out of the kingdom.    The planters, merchants, and others, being thus circumstanced, knew not  what to do. They were afraid of taking their slaves away by force, and they  were equally afraid of bringing any of the cases before a public court. In  this dilemma, in 1729 they applied to York and Talbot, the attorney and  solicitor-general for the time being, and obtained the following strange  opinion from them:--\"We are of opinion, that a slave by coming from the  West Indies into Great Britain or Ireland, either with or without his  master, does not become free, and that his master's right and property in  him is not thereby determined or varied, and that baptism doth not bestow  freedom on him, nor make any alteration in his temporal condition in these  kingdoms. We are also of opinion, that the master may legally compel him to  return again to the plantations.\"    This cruel and illegal opinion was delivered in the year 1729. The  planters, merchants, and others, gave it of course all the publicity in  their power. And the consequences were as might easily have been  apprehended. In a little time slaves absconding were advertised in the  London papers as runaways, and rewards offered for the apprehension of  them, in the same brutal manner as we find them advertised in the land of  slavery. They were advertised also, in the same papers, to be sold by  auction, sometimes by themselves, and at others with horses, chaises, and  harness. They were seized also by their masters, or by persons employed by  them, in the very streets, and dragged from thence to the ships; and so  unprotected now were these poor slaves, that persons in nowise concerned  with them began to institute a trade in their persons, making agreements  with captains, of ships going to the West Indies to put them on board at a  certain price. This last instance shows how far human nature is capable of  going, and is an answer to those persons, who have denied that kidnapping  in Africa was a source of supplying the Slave-trade. It shows, as all  history does from the time of Joseph, that, where there is a market for the  persons of human beings, all kinds of enormities will be practised to  obtain them.    These circumstances then, as I observed before, did not fail of producing  new coadjators in the cause. And first they produced that able and  indefatigable advocate Mr. Granville Sharp. This gentleman is to be  distinguished from those who preceded him by this particular, that, whereas  these were only writers, he was both a writer and an actor in the cause. In  fact, he was the first labourer in it in England. By the words \"actor\" and  \"labourer,\" I mean that he determined upon a plan of action in behalf of  the oppressed Africans, to the accomplishment of which he devoted a  considerable portion of his time, talents, and substance. What Mr. Sharp  has done to merit the title of coadjutor in this high sense, I shall now  explain. The following is a short history of the beginning and of the  course of his labours.    In the year 1765, Mr. David Lisle had brought over from Barbadoes Jonathan  Strong, an African slave, as his servant. He used the latter in a barbarous  manner at his lodgings in Wapping, but particularly by beating him over the  head with a pistol, which occasioned his head to swell. When the swelling  went down, a disorder fell into his eyes, which threatened the loss of  them. To this an ague and fever succeeded, and a lameness in both his legs.    Jonathan Strong, having been brought into this deplorable situation, and  being therefore wholly useless, was left by his master to go whither he  pleased. He applied accordingly to Mr. William Sharp the surgeon for his  advice, as to one who gave up a portion of his time to the healing of the  diseases of the poor. It was here that Mr. Granville Sharp, the brother of  the former, saw him. Suffice it to say, that in process of time he was  cured. During this time Mr. Granville Sharp, pitying his hard case,  supplied him with money, and he afterwards got him a situation in the  family of Mr. Brown, an apothecary, to carry out medicines.    In this new situation, when Strong had become healthy and robust in his  appearance, his master happened to see him. The latter immediately formed  the design of possessing him again. Accordingly, when he had found out his  residence, he procured John Ross keeper of the Poultry-compter, and William  Miller an officer under the lord-mayor, to kidnap him. This was done by  sending for him to a public-house in Fenchurch-street, and then seizing  him. By these he was conveyed, without any warrant, to the Poultry-compter,  where he was sold by his master, to John Kerr, for thirty pounds.    Strong, in this situation, sent, as was usual, to his godfathers, John  London and Stephen Nail, for their protection. They went, but were refused  admittance to him. At length he sent for Mr. Granville Sharp. The latter  went, but they still refused access to the prisoner. He insisted, however,  upon seeing him, and charged the keeper of the prison at his peril to  deliver him up till he had been carried before a magistrate.    Mr. Sharp, immediately upon this, waited upon Sir Robert Kite, the then  lord-mayor, and entreated him to send for Strong, and to hear his case. A  day was accordingly appointed. Mr. Sharp attended, and also William McBean,  a notary-public, and David Laird, captain of the ship Thames, which was to  have conveyed Strong to Jamaica, in behalf of the purchaser, John Kerr. A  long conversation ensued, in which the opinion of York and Talbot was  quoted. Mr. Sharp made his observations. Certain lawyers, who were present,  seemed to be staggered at the case, but inclined rather to recommit the  prisoner. The lord-mayor, however, discharged Strong, as he had been taken  up without a warrant.    As soon as this determination was made known, the parties began to move  off. Captain Laird, however, who kept close to Strong, laid hold of him  before he had quitted the room, and said aloud, \"Then I now seize him as my  slave.\" Upon this, Mr. Sharp put his hand upon Laird's shoulder, and  pronounced these words: \"I charge you, in the name of the king, with an  assault upon the person of Jonathan Strong, and all these are my  witnesses.\" Laird was greatly intimidated by this charge, made in the  presence of the lord-mayor and others, and, fearing a prosecution, let his  prisoner go, leaving him to be conveyed away by Mr. Sharp.    Mr. Sharp, having been greatly affected by this case, and foreseeing how  much he might be engaged in others of a similar nature, thought it time  that the law of the land should be known upon this subject. He applied  therefore to Doctor Blackstone, afterwards Judge Blackstone, for his  opinion upon it. He was, however, not satisfied with it, when he received  it; nor could he obtain any satisfactory answer from several other lawyers,  to whom he afterwards applied. The truth is, that the opinion of York and  Talbot, which had been made public and acted upon by the planters,  merchants, and others, was considered of high authority, and scarcely any  one dared to question the legality of it. In this situation, Mr. Sharp saw  no means of help but in his own industry, and he determined immediately to  give up two or"]]]
