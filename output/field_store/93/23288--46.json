[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#7)"],[1,"the Tin Woodman tried to think of some way to  escape from the castle before morning, but she seemed to read their  thoughts and shook her head.    \"Don't worry your poor brains,\" said she. \"You can't escape me, however  hard you try. But why should you wish to escape? I shall give you new  forms that are much better than the ones you now have. Be contented  with your fate, for discontent leads to unhappiness, and unhappiness,  in any form, is the greatest evil that can befall you.\"    \"What forms do you intend to give us?\" asked Woot earnestly.    \"I haven't decided, as yet. I'll dream over it tonight, so in the  morning I shall have made up my mind how to transform you. Perhaps  you'd prefer to choose your own transformations?\"    \"No,\" said Woot, \"I prefer to remain as I am.\"    \"That's funny,\" she retorted. \"You are little, and you're weak; as you  are, you're not much account, anyhow. The best thing about you is that  you're alive, for I shall be able to make of you some sort of live  creature which will be a great improvement on your present form.\"    She took another biscuit from a plate and dipped it in a pot of honey  and calmly began eating it.    The Scarecrow watched her thoughtfully.    \"There are no fields of grain in your Valley,\" said he; \"where, then,  did you get the flour to make your biscuits?\"    \"Mercy me! do you think I'd bother to make biscuits out of flour?\" she  replied. \"That is altogether too tedious a process for a Yookoohoo. I  set some traps this afternoon and caught a lot of field-mice, but as I  do not like to eat mice, I transformed them into hot biscuits for my  supper. The honey in this pot was once a wasp's nest, but since being  transformed it has become sweet and delicious. All I need do, when I  wish to eat, is to take something I don't care to keep, and transform  it into any sort of food I like, and eat it. Are you hungry?\"    \"I don't eat, thank you,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Nor do I,\" said the Tin Woodman.    \"I have still a little natural food in my knapsack,\" said Woot the  Wanderer, \"and I'd rather eat that than any wasp's nest.\"    \"Every one to his taste,\" said the Giantess carelessly, and having now  finished her supper she rose to her feet, clapped her hands together,  and the supper table at once disappeared.          Chapter Six    The Magic of a Yookoohoo      Woot had seen very little of magic during his wanderings, while the  Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had seen a great deal of many sorts in  their lives, yet all three were greatly impressed by Mrs. Yoop's  powers. She did not affect any mysterious airs or indulge in chants or  mystic rites, as most witches do, nor was the Giantess old and ugly or  disagreeable in face or manner. Nevertheless, she frightened her  prisoners more than any witch could have done.    \"Please be seated,\" she said to them, as she sat herself down in a  great arm-chair and spread her beautiful embroidered skirts for them to  admire. But all the chairs in the room were so high that our friends  could not climb to the seats of them. Mrs. Yoop observed this and waved  her hand, when instantly a golden ladder appeared leaning against a  chair opposite her own.    \"Climb up,\" said she, and they obeyed, the Tin Man and the boy  assisting the more clumsy Scarecrow. When they were all seated in a row  on the cushion of the chair, the Giantess continued: \"Now tell me how  you happened to travel in this direction, and where you came from and  what your errand is.\"    So the Tin Woodman told her all about Nimmie Amee, and how he had  decided to find her and marry her, although he had no Loving Heart. The  story seemed to amuse the big woman, who then began to ask the  Scarecrow questions and for the first time in her life heard of Ozma of  Oz, and of Dorothy and Jack Pumpkinhead and Dr. Pipt and Tik-tok and  many other Oz people who are well known in the Emerald City. Also Woot  had to tell his story, which was very simple and did not take long. The  Giantess laughed heartily when the boy related their adventure at  Loonville, but said she knew nothing of the Loons because she never  left her Valley.    \"There are wicked people who would like to capture me, as they did my  giant husband, Mr. Yoop,\" said she; \"so I stay at home and mind my own  business.\"    \"If Ozma knew that you dared to work magic without her consent, she  would punish you severely,\" declared the Scarecrow, \"for this castle is  in the Land of Oz, and no persons in the Land of Oz are permitted to  work magic except Glinda the Good and the little Wizard who lives with  Ozma in the Emerald City.\"    \"That for your Ozma!\" exclaimed the Giantess, snapping her fingers in  derision. \"What do I care for a girl whom I have never seen and who has  never seen me?\"    \"But Ozma is a fairy,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"and therefore she is very  powerful. Also, we are under Ozma's protection, and to injure us in any  way would make her extremely angry.\"    \"What I do here, in my own private castle in this secluded  Valley--where no one comes but fools like you--can never be known to  your fairy Ozma,\" returned the Giantess. \"Do not seek to frighten me  from my purpose, and do not allow yourselves to be frightened, for it  is best to meet bravely what cannot be avoided. I am now going to bed,  and in the morning I will give you all new forms, such as will be more  interesting to me than the ones you now wear. Good night, and pleasant  dreams.\"    Saying this, Mrs. Yoop rose from her chair and walked through a doorway  into another room. So heavy was the tread of the Giantess that even the  walls of the big stone castle trembled as she stepped. She closed the  door of her bedroom behind her, and then suddenly the light went out  and the three prisoners found themselves in total darkness.    The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow didn't mind the dark at all, but Woot  the Wanderer felt worried to be left in this strange place in this  strange manner, without being able to see any danger that might  threaten.    \"The big woman might have given me a bed, anyhow,\" he said to his  companions, and scarcely had he spoken when he felt something press  against his legs, which were then dangling from the seat of the chair.  Leaning down, he put out his hand and found that a bedstead had  appeared, with mattress, sheets and covers, all complete. He lost no  time in slipping down upon the bed and was soon fast asleep.    During the night the Scarecrow and the Emperor talked in low tones  together, and they got out of the chair and moved all about the room,  feeling for some hidden spring that might open a door or window and  permit them to escape.    Morning found them still unsuccessful in the quest and as soon as it  was daylight Woot's bed suddenly disappeared, and he dropped to the  floor with a thump that quickly wakened him. And after a time the  Giantess came from her bedroom, wearing another dress that was quite as  elaborate as the one in which she had been attired the evening before,  and also wearing the pretty lace apron. Having seated herself in a  chair, she said:    \"I'm hungry; so I'll have breakfast at once.\"    She clapped her hands together and instantly the table appeared before  her, spread with snowy linen and laden with golden dishes. But there  was no food upon the table, nor anything else except a pitcher of  water, a bundle of weeds and a handful of pebbles. But the Giantess  poured some water into her coffee-pot, patted it once or twice with her  hand, and then poured out a cupful of steaming hot coffee.    \"Would you like some?\" she asked Woot.    He was suspicious of magic coffee, but it smelled so good that he could  not resist it; so he answered: \"If you please, Madam.\"    The Giantess poured out another cup and set it on the floor for Woot.  It was as big as a tub, and the golden spoon in the saucer beside the  cup was so heavy the boy could scarcely lift it. But Woot managed to  get a sip of the coffee and found it delicious.    Mrs. Yoop next transformed the weeds into a dish of oatmeal, which she  ate with good appetite.    \"Now, then,\" said she, picking up the pebbles. \"I'm wondering whether I  shall have fish-balls or lamb-chops to complete my meal. Which would  you prefer, Woot the Wanderer?\"    \"If you please, I'll eat the food in my knapsack,\" answered the boy.  \"Your magic food might taste good, but I'm afraid of it.\"    The woman laughed at his fears and transformed the pebbles into  fish-balls.    \"I suppose you think that after you had eaten this food it would turn  to stones again and make you sick,\" she remarked; \"but that would be  impossible. Nothing I transform ever gets back to its former shape  again, so these fish-balls can never more be pebbles. That is why I  have to be careful of my transformations,\" she added, busily eating  while she talked, \"for while I can change forms at will I can never  change them back again--which proves that even the powers of a clever  Yookoohoo are limited. When I have transformed you three people, you  must always wear the shapes that I have given you.\"    \"Then please don't transform us,\" begged Woot, \"for we are quite  satisfied to remain as we are.\"    \"I am not expecting to satisfy you, but intend to please myself,\" she  declared, \"and my pleasure is to give you new shapes. For, if by chance  your friends came in search of you, not one of them would be able to  recognize you.\"    Her tone was so positive that they knew it would be useless to protest.  The woman was not unpleasant to look at; her face was not cruel; her  voice was big but gracious in tone; but her words showed that she  possessed a merciless heart and no pleadings would alter her wicked  purpose.    Mrs. Yoop took ample time to finish her breakfast and the prisoners had  no desire to hurry her, but finally the meal was concluded and she  folded her napkin and made the table disappear by clapping her hands  together. Then she turned to her captives"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#7)"],[1,"\"You did not mean that. You are angry and speak unwisely, without  reflection. I came here from my palace in the Emerald City to prevent  war and to make peace between you and the Skeezers. I do not approve of  Queen Coo-ee-oh's action in transforming your wife Rora into a pig, nor  do I approve of Rora's cruel attempt to poison the fishes in the lake.  No one has the right to work magic in my dominions without my consent,  so the Flatheads and the Skeezers have both broken my laws--which must  be obeyed.\"    \"If you want to make peace,\" said the Su-dic, \"make the Skeezers  restore my wife to her proper form and give back her four cans of  brains. Also make them agree to allow us to catch fish in their lake.\"    \"No,\" returned Ozma, \"I will not do that, for it would be unjust. I  will have the Golden Pig again transformed into your wife Rora, and  give her one can of brains, but the other three cans must be restored  to those she robbed. Neither may you catch fish in the Lake of the  Skeezers, for it is their lake and the fish belong to them. This  arrangement is just and honorable, and you must agree to it.\"    \"Never!\" cried the Su-dic. Just then a pig came running into the room,  uttering dismal grunts. It was made of solid gold, with joints at the  bends of the legs and in the neck and jaws. The Golden Pig's eyes were  rubies, and its teeth were polished ivory.    \"There!\" said the Su-dic, \"gaze on the evil work of Queen Coo-ee-oh,  and then say if you can prevent my making war on the Skeezers. That  grunting beast was once my wife--the most beautiful Flathead on our  mountain and a skillful witch. Now look at her!\"    \"Fight the Skeezers, fight the Skeezers, fight the Skeezers!\" grunted  the Golden Pig.    \"I will fight the Skeezers,\" exclaimed the Flathead chief, \"and if a  dozen Ozmas of Oz forbade me I would fight just the same.\"    \"Not if I can prevent it!\" asserted Ozma.    \"You can't prevent it. But since you threaten me, I'll have you  confined in the bronze prison until the war is over,\" said the Su-dic.  He whistled and four stout Flatheads, armed with axes and spears,  entered the room and saluted him. Turning to the men he said: \"Take  these two girls, bind them with wire ropes and cast them into the  bronze prison.\"    The four men bowed low and one of them asked:    \"Where are the two girls, most noble Su-dic?\"    The Su-dic turned to where Ozma and Dorothy had stood but they had  vanished!          Chapter Seven    The Magic Isle      Ozma, seeing it was useless to argue with the Supreme Dictator of the  Flatheads, had been considering how best to escape from his power. She  realized that his sorcery might be difficult to overcome, and when he  threatened to cast Dorothy and her into a bronze prison she slipped her  hand into her bosom and grasped her silver wand. With the other hand  she grasped the hand of Dorothy, but these motions were so natural that  the Su-dic did not notice them. Then when he turned to meet his four  soldiers, Ozma instantly rendered both herself and Dorothy invisible  and swiftly led her companion around the group of Flatheads and out of  the room. As they reached the entry and descended the stone steps, Ozma  whispered:    \"Let us run, dear! We are invisible, so no one will see us.\"    Dorothy understood and she was a good runner. Ozma had marked the place  where the grand stairway that led to the plain was located, so they  made directly for it. Some people were in the paths but these they  dodged around. One or two Flatheads heard the pattering of footsteps of  the girls on the stone pavement and stopped with bewildered looks to  gaze around them, but no one interfered with the invisible fugitives.    The Su-dic had lost no time in starting the chase. He and his men ran  so fast that they might have overtaken the girls before they reached  the stairway had not the Golden Pig suddenly run across their path. The  Su-dic tripped over the pig and fell flat, and his four men tripped  over him and tumbled in a heap. Before they could scramble up and reach  the mouth of the passage it was too late to stop the two girls.    There was a guard on each side of the stairway, but of course they did  not see Ozma and Dorothy as they sped past and descended the steps.  Then they had to go up five steps and down another ten, and so on, in  the same manner in which they had climbed to the top of the mountain.  Ozma lighted their way with her wand and they kept on without relaxing  their speed until they reached the bottom. Then they ran to the right  and turned the corner of the invisible wall just as the Su-dic and his  followers rushed out of the arched entrance and looked around in an  attempt to discover the fugitives.    Ozma now knew they were safe, so she told Dorothy to stop and both of  them sat down on the grass until they could breathe freely and become  rested from their mad flight.    As for the Su-dic, he realized he was foiled and soon turned and  climbed his stairs again. He was very angry--angry with Ozma and angry  with himself--because, now that he took time to think, he remembered  that he knew very well the art of making people invisible, and visible  again, and if he had only thought of it in time he could have used his  magic knowledge to make the girls visible and so have captured them  easily. However, it was now too late for regrets and he determined to  make preparations at once to march all his forces against the Skeezers.    \"What shall we do next?\" asked Dorothy, when they were rested.    \"Let us find the Lake of the Skeezers,\" replied Ozma. \"From what that  dreadful Su-dic said I imagine the Skeezers are good people and worthy  of our friendship, and if we go to them we may help them to defeat the  Flatheads.\"    \"I s'pose we can't stop the war now,\" remarked Dorothy reflectively, as  they walked toward the row of palm trees.    \"No; the Su-dic is determined to fight the Skeezers, so all we can do  is to warn them of their danger and help them as much as possible.\"    \"Of course you'll punish the Flatheads,\" said Dorothy.    \"Well, I do not think the Flathead people are as much to blame as their  Supreme Dictator,\" was the answer. \"If he is removed from power and his  unlawful magic taken from him, the people will probably be good and  respect the laws of the Land of Oz, and live at peace with all their  neighbors in the future.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Dorothy with a sigh of doubt    The palms were not far from the mountain and the girls reached them  after a brisk walk. The huge trees were set close together, in three  rows, and had been planted so as to keep people from passing them, but  the Flatheads had cut a passage through this barrier and Ozma found the  path and led Dorothy to the other side.    Beyond the palms they discovered a very beautiful scene. Bordered by a  green lawn was a great lake fully a mile from shore to shore, the  waters of which were exquisitely blue and sparkling, with little  wavelets breaking its smooth surface where the breezes touched it. In  the center of this lake appeared a lovely island, not of great extent  but almost entirely covered by a huge round building with glass walls  and a high glass dome which glittered brilliantly in the sunshine.  Between the glass building and the edge of the island was no grass,  flowers or shrubbery, but only an expanse of highly polished white  marble. There were no boats on either shore and no signs of life could  be seen anywhere on the island.    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, gazing wistfully at the island, \"we've found the  Lake of the Skeezers and their Magic Isle. I guess the Skeezers are in  that big glass palace, but we can't get at 'em.\"          Chapter Eight    Queen Coo-ee-oh      Princess Ozma considered the situation gravely. Then she tied her  handkerchief to her wand and, standing at the water's edge, waved the  handkerchief like a flag, as a signal. For a time they could observe no  response.    \"I don't see what good that will do,\" said Dorothy. \"Even if the  Skeezers are on that island and see us, and know we're friends, they  haven't any boats to come and get us.\"    But the Skeezers didn't need boats, as the girls soon discovered. For  on a sudden an opening appeared at the base of the palace and from the  opening came a slender shaft of steel, reaching out slowly but steadily  across the water in the direction of the place where they stood. To the  girls this steel arrangement looked like a triangle, with the base  nearest the water. It came toward them in the form of an arch,  stretching out from the palace wall until its end reached the bank and  rested there, while the other end still remained on the island.    Then they saw that it was a bridge, consisting of a steel footway just  broad enough to walk on, and two slender guide rails, one on either  side, which were connected with the footway by steel bars. The bridge  looked rather frail and Dorothy feared it would not bear their weight,  but Ozma at once called, \"Come on!\" and started to walk across, holding  fast to the rail on either side. So Dorothy summoned her courage and  followed after. Before Ozma had taken three steps she halted and so  forced Dorothy to halt, for the bridge was again moving and returning  to the island.    \"We need not walk after all,\" said Ozma. So they stood still in their  places and let the steel bridge draw them onward. Indeed, the bridge  drew them well into the glass-domed building which covered the island,  and soon they found themselves standing in a marble room where two  handsomely dressed young men stood on a platform to receive them.    Ozma at once stepped from the end of the bridge to the marble platform,  followed by Dorothy, and then the bridge disappeared with a slight  clang of steel and a marble slab covered the opening from which it had  emerged.    The two young men bowed profoundly to Ozma, and one of them said:    \"Queen Coo-ee-oh bids you welcome, O"]]]
