[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#8)"],[1," little bureau. What  did Dr. Jervis wish to know about it?\"    Seeing that she was terrified lest some new and dreadful surprise should  be sprung upon her, I hastened to reassure her.    \"My colleague, Dr. Thorndyke, is anxious to examine it. He is directing  your nephew's defence, you know.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Mrs. Hornby. \"Juliet told me about him. She says he is  a dear. Do you agree with her?\"    Here I caught Miss Gibson's eye, in which was a mischievous twinkle, and  noted a little deeper pink in her cheeks.    \"Well,\" I answered dubiously, \"I have never considered my colleague in  the capacity of a dear, but I have a very high opinion of him in every  respect.\"    \"That, no doubt, is the masculine equivalent,\" said Miss Gibson,  recovering from the momentary embarrassment that Mrs. Hornby's artless  repetition of her phrase had produced. \"I think the feminine expression  is more epigrammatic and comprehensive. But to return to the object of  Dr. Jervis's visit. Would you let him have the 'Thumbograph,' aunt, to  show to Dr. Thorndyke?\"  \"Oh, my dear Juliet,\" replied Mrs. Hornby, \"I  would do anything--anything--to help our poor boy. I will never believe  that he could be guilty of theft--common, vulgar theft. There has been  some dreadful mistake--I am convinced there has--I told the detectives  so. I assured them that Reuben could not have committed the robbery, and  that they were totally mistaken in supposing him to be capable of such  an action. But they would not listen to me, although I have known him  since he was a little child, and ought to be able to judge, if anyone  is. Diamonds, too! Now, I ask you, what could Reuben want with diamonds?  and they were not even cut.\"    Here Mrs. Hornby drew forth a lace-edged handkerchief and mopped her  eyes.    \"I am sure Dr. Thorndyke will be very much interested to see this little  book of yours,\" said I, with a view to stemming the tide of her  reflections.    \"Oh, the 'Thumbograph,'\" she replied. \"Yes, I will let him have it with  the greatest pleasure. I am so glad he wishes to see it; it makes one  feel hopeful to know that he is taking so much interest in the case.  Would you believe it, Dr. Jervis, those detective people actually wanted  to keep it to bring up in evidence against the poor boy. My  'Thumbograph,' mind you. But I put my foot down there and they had to  return it. I was resolved that they should not receive any assistance  from me in their efforts to involve my nephew in this horrible affair.\"    \"Then, perhaps,\" said Miss Gibson, \"you might give Dr. Jervis the  'Thumbograph' and he can hand it to Dr. Thorndyke.\"    \"Of course I will,\" said Mrs. Hornby; \"instantly; and you need not  return it, Dr. Jervis. When you have finished with it, fling it into the  fire. I wish never to see it again.\"    But I had been considering the matter, and had come to the conclusion  that it would be highly indiscreet to take the book out of Mrs. Hornby's  custody, and this I now proceeded to explain.    \"I have no idea,\" I said, \"for what purpose Dr. Thorndyke wishes to  examine the 'Thumbograph,' but it occurs to me that he may desire to put  it in evidence, in which case it would be better that it should not go  out of your possession for the present. He merely commissioned me to ask  for your permission to take a photograph of it.\"    \"Oh, if he wants a photograph,\" said Mrs. Hornby, \"I could get one done  for him without any difficulty. My nephew Walter would take one for us,  I am sure, if I asked him. He is so clever, you know--is he not, Juliet,  dear?\"    \"Yes, aunt,\" replied Miss Gibson quickly, \"but I expect Dr. Thorndyke  would rather take the photograph himself.\"    \"I am sure he would,\" I agreed. \"In fact, a photograph taken by another  person would not be of much use to him.\"    \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Hornby in a slightly injured tone, \"you think Walter is  just an ordinary amateur; but if I were to show you some of the  photographs he has taken you would really be surprised. He is remarkably  clever, I assure you.\"    \"Would you like us to bring the book to Dr. Thorndyke's chambers?\" asked  Miss Gibson. \"That would save time and trouble.\"    \"It is excessively good of you--\" I began.    \"Not at all. When shall we bring it? Would you like to have it this  evening?\"    \"We should very much,\" I replied. \"My colleague could then examine it  and decide what is to be done with it. But it is giving you so much  trouble.\"    \"It is nothing of the kind,\" said Miss Gibson. \"You would not mind  coming with me this evening, would you, aunt?\"    \"Certainly not, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Hornby, and she was about to  enlarge on the subject when Miss Gibson rose and, looking at her watch,  declared that she must start on her errand at once. I also rose to make  my adieux, and she then remarked--    \"If you are walking in the same direction as I am, Dr. Jervis, we might  arrange the time of our proposed visit as we go along.\"    I was not slow to avail myself of this invitation, and a few seconds  later we left the house together, leaving Mrs. Hornby smiling fatuously  after us from the open door.    \"Will eight o'clock suit you, do you think?\" Miss Gibson asked, as we  walked up the street.    \"It will do excellently, I should say,\" I answered. \"If anything should  render the meeting impossible I will send you a telegram. I could wish  that you were coming alone, as ours is to be a business conference.\"    Miss Gibson laughed softly--and a very pleasant and musical laugh it  was.    \"Yes,\" she agreed. \"Dear Mrs. Hornby is a little diffuse and difficult  to keep to one subject; but you must be indulgent to her little  failings; you would be if you had experienced such kindness and  generosity from her as I have.\"    \"I am sure I should,\" I rejoined; \"in fact, I am. After all, a little  diffuseness of speech and haziness of ideas are no great faults in a  generous and amiable woman of her age.\"    Miss Gibson rewarded me for these highly correct sentiments with a  little smile of approval, and we walked on for some time in silence.  Presently she turned to me with some suddenness and a very earnest  expression, and said--    \"I want to ask you a question, Dr. Jervis, and please forgive me if I  beg you to put aside your professional reserve just a little in my  favour. I want you to tell me if you think Dr. Thorndyke has any kind of  hope or expectation of being able to save poor Reuben from the dreadful  peril that threatens him.\"    This was a rather pointed question, and I took some time to consider it  before replying.    \"I should like,\" I replied at length, \"to tell you as much as my duty to  my colleague will allow me to; but that is so little that it is hardly  worth telling. However, I may say this without breaking any confidence:  Dr. Thorndyke has undertaken the case and is working hard at it, and he  would, most assuredly, have done neither the one nor the other if he had  considered it a hopeless one.\"    \"That is a very encouraging view of the matter,\" said she, \"which, had,  however, already occurred to me. May I ask if anything came of your  visit to Scotland Yard? Oh, please don't think me encroaching; I am so  terribly anxious and troubled.\"    \"I can tell you very little about the results of our expedition, for I  know very little; but I have an idea that Dr. Thorndyke is not  dissatisfied with his morning's work. He certainly picked up some facts,  though I have no idea of their nature, and as soon as we reached home he  developed a sudden desire to examine the 'Thumbograph.'\"    \"Thank you, Dr. Jervis,\" she said gratefully. \"You have cheered me more  than I can tell you, and I won't ask you any more questions. Are you  sure I am not bringing you out of the way?\"    \"Not at all,\" I answered hastily. \"The fact is, I had hoped to have a  little chat with you when we had disposed of the 'Thumbograph,' so I can  regard myself as combining a little business with a great deal of  pleasure if I am allowed to accompany you.\"    She gave me a little ironical bow as she inquired--    \"And, in short, I may take it that I am to be pumped?\"    \"Come, now,\" I retorted. \"You have been plying the pump handle pretty  vigorously yourself. But that is not my meaning at all. You see, we are  absolute strangers to all the parties concerned in this case, which, of  course, makes for an impartial estimate of their characters. But, after  all, knowledge is more useful to us than impartiality. There is our  client, for instance. He impressed us both very favourably, I think; but  he might have been a plausible rascal with the blackest of records. Then  you come and tell us that he is a gentleman of stainless character and  we are at once on firmer ground.\"    \"I see,\" said Miss Gibson thoughtfully; \"and suppose that I or some one  else had told you things that seemed to reflect on his character. Would  they have influenced you in your attitude towards him?\"    \"Only in this,\" I replied; \"that we should have made it our business to  inquire into the truth of those reports and ascertain their origin.\"    \"That is what one should always do, I suppose,\" said she, still with an  air of deep thoughtfulness which encouraged me to inquire--    \"May I ask if anyone to your knowledge has ever said anything to Mr.  Reuben's disadvantage?\"    She pondered for some time before replying, and kept her eyes bent  pensively on the ground. At length she said, not without some hesitation  of manner--    \"It is a small thing and quite without any bearing on this affair. But  it has been a great trouble to me since it has to some extent put a  barrier between Reuben and me; and we used to be such close friends. And  I have blamed myself for letting it influence me--perhaps unjustly--in  my opinion of him. I will tell you about it, though I expect you will  think me very foolish.    \"You must know, then, that Reuben and I used, until about six months  ago, to be very much together,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#8)"],[1,"of my enterprising young friend from this quarter.    \"Do you never make any expeditions yourself, Mr. Quinby?\"    \"Sometimes.\" Quinby looked puzzled. \"Why do you ask?\" he was constrained  to add.    \"You should have volunteered instead of Mrs. Lascelles to-day. It would  have been an excellent opportunity for prosecuting your own rather  enterprising studies.\"    One would have thought that one's displeasure was plain enough at last;  but not a bit of it. So far from resenting the rebuff, the fellow  plucked my sleeve, and I saw at a glance that he had not even listened  to my too elaborate sarcasm.    \"Talk of the--lady!\" he whispered. \"Here she comes.\"    And a second glance intercepted Mrs. Lascelles on the steps, with her  bold good looks and her fine upstanding carriage, cut clean as a  diamond in that intensifying atmosphere, and hardly less dazzling to the  eye. Yet her cotton gown was simplicity's self; it was the right setting  for such natural brilliance, a brilliance of eyes and teeth and  colouring, a more uncommon brilliance of expression. Indeed it was a  wonderful expression, brave rather than sweet, yet capable of sweetness  too, and for the moment at least nobly free from the defensive  bitterness which was to mark it later. So she stood upon the steps, the  talk of the hotel, trailing, with characteristic independence, a cane  chair behind her, while she sought a shady place for it, even as I had  stood seeking for her: before she found one I was hobbling toward her.    \"Oh, thanks, Captain Clephane, but I couldn't think of allowing you!  Well, then, between us, if you insist. Here under the wall, I think, is  as good a place as any.\"    She pointed out a clear space in the rapidly narrowing ribbon of shade,  and there I soon saw Mrs. Lascelles settled with her book (a trashy  novel, that somehow brought Catherine Evers rather sharply before my  mind's eye) in an isolation as complete as could be found upon the  crowded terrace, and too intentional on her part to permit of an  intrusion on mine. I lingered a moment, nevertheless.    \"So you didn't go to that hut after all, Mrs. Lascelles?\"    \"No.\" She waited a moment before looking up at me. \"And I'm afraid Mr.  Evers will never forgive me,\" she added after her look, in the rich  undertone that had impressed me overnight, before the cigarette  controversy.    I was not going to say that I had seen Bob before he started, but it was  an opportunity of speaking generally of the lad. Thus I found myself  commenting on the coincidence of our meeting again--he and I--and again  lying before I realised that it was a lie. But Mrs. Lascelles sat  looking up at me with her fine and candid eyes, as though she knew as  well as I which was the real coincidence, and knew that I knew into the  bargain. It gave me the disconcerting sensation of being detected and  convicted at one blow. Bob Evers failed me as a topic, and I stood like  the fool I felt.    \"I am sure you ought not to stand about so much, Captain Clephane.\"    Mrs. Lascelles was smiling faintly as I prepared to take her hint.    \"Doesn't it really do you any harm?\" she inquired in time to detain me.    \"No, just the opposite. I am ordered to take all the exercise I can.\"    \"Even walking?\"    \"Even hobbling, Mrs. Lascelles, if I don't overdo it.\"    She sat some moments in thought. I guessed what she was thinking, and I  was right.    \"There are some lovely walks quite near, Captain Clephane. But you have  to climb a little, either going or coming.\"    \"I could climb a little,\" said I, making up my mind. \"It's within the  meaning of the act--it would do me good. Which way will you take me,  Mrs. Lascelles?\"    Mrs. Lascelles looked up quickly, surprised at a boldness on which I was  already complimenting myself. But it is the only way with a bold woman.    \"Did I say I would take you at all, Captain Clephane?\"    \"No, but I very much hope you will.\"    And our eyes met as fairly as they had done by matchlight the night  before.    \"Then I will,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"because I want to speak to you.\"          CHAPTER V    A MARKED WOMAN      We had come farther than was wise without a rest, but all the seats on  the way were in full view of the hotel, and I had been irritated by  divers looks and whisperings as we traversed the always crowded terrace.  Bob Evers, no doubt, would have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to  them. I myself could pretend to do so, but pretence was evidently one of  my strong points. I had not Bob's fine natural regardlessness, for all  my seniority and presumably superior knowledge of the world.    So we had climbed the zigzags to the right of the Riffelberg and  followed the footpath overlooking the glacier, in the silence enjoined  by single file, but at last we were seated on the hillside, a trifle  beyond that emerald patch which some humourist has christened the  Cricket-ground. Beneath us were the serracs of the Gorner Glacier,  teased and tousled like a fringe of frozen breakers. Beyond the serracs  was the main stream of comparatively smooth ice, with its mourning band  of moraine, and beyond that the mammoth sweep and curve of the Theodule  where these glaciers join. Peak after peak of dazzling snow dwindled  away to the left. Only the gaunt Riffelhorn reared a brown head against  the blue. And there we sat, Mrs. Lascelles and I, with all this before  us and a rock behind, while I wondered what my companion meant to say,  and how she would begin.    I had not to wonder long.    \"You were very good to me last night, Captain Clephane.\"    There was evidently no beating about the bush for Mrs. Lascelles. I  thoroughly approved, but was nevertheless somewhat embarrassed for the  moment.    \"I--really I don't know how, Mrs. Lascelles!\"    \"Oh, yes, you do, Captain Clephane; you recognised me at a glance, as I  did you.\"    \"I certainly thought I did,\" said I, poking about with the ferrule of  one of my sticks.    \"You know you did.\"    \"You are making me know it.\"    \"Captain Clephane, you knew it all along; but we won't argue that point.  I am not going to deny my identity. It is very good of you to give me  the chance, if rather unnecessary. I am not a criminal. Still you could  have made me feel like one, last night, and heaps of men would have done  so, either for the fun of it or from want of tact.\"    I looked inquiringly at Mrs. Lascelles. She could tell me what she  pleased, but I was not going to anticipate her by displaying an  independent knowledge of matters which she might still care to keep to  herself. If she chose to open up a painful subject, well, the pain be  upon her own head. Yet I must say that there was very little of it in  her face as our eyes met. There was the eager candour that one could not  help admiring, with the glowing look of gratitude which I had done so  ridiculously little to earn; but the fine flushed face betrayed neither  pain, nor shame, nor the affectation of one or the other. There was a  certain shyness with the candour. That was all.    \"You know quite well what I mean,\" continued Mrs. Lascelles, with a  genuine smile at my disingenuous face. \"When you met me before it was  under another name, which you have probably quite forgotten.\"    \"No, I remember it.\"    \"Do you remember my husband?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    \"Did you ever hear--\"    Her lip trembled. I dropped my eyes.    \"Yes,\" I admitted, \"or rather I saw it for myself in the papers. It's no  use pretending I didn't, nor yet that I was the least bit surprised  or--or anything else!\"    That was not one of my tactful speeches. It was culpably, might indeed  have been wilfully, ambiguous; and yet it was the kind of clumsy and  impulsive utterance which has the ring of a good intention, and is thus  inoffensive except to such as seek excuses for offence. My instincts  about Mrs. Lascelles did not place her in this category at all.  Nevertheless, the ensuing pause was long enough to make me feel uneasy,  and my companion only broke it as I was in the act of framing an  apology.    \"May I bore you, Captain Clephane?\" she asked abruptly. I looked at her  once more. She had regained an equal mastery of face and voice, and the  admirable candour of her eyes was undimmed by the smallest trace of  tears.    \"You may try,\" said I, smiling with the obvious gallantry.    \"If I tell you something about myself from that time on, will you  believe what I say?\"    \"You are the last person whom I should think of disbelieving.\"    \"Thank you, Captain Clephane.\"    \"On the other hand, I would much rather you didn't say anything that  gave you pain, or that you might afterward regret.\"    There was a touch of weariness in Mrs. Lascelles's smile, a rather  pathetic touch to my mind, as she shook her head.    \"I am not very sensitive to pain,\" she remarked. \"That is the one thing  to be said for having to bear a good deal while you are fairly young. I  want you to know more about me, because I believe you are the only  person here who knows anything at all. And then--you didn't give me away  last night!\"    I pointed to the grassy ledge in front of us, such a vivid green against  the house now a hundred feet below.    \"I am not pushing you over there,\" I said. \"I take about as much credit  for that.\"    \"Ah,\" sighed Mrs. Lascelles, \"but that dear boy, who turns out to be a  friend of yours, he knows less than anybody else! He doesn't even  suspect. It would have hurt me, yes, it would have hurt even me, to be  given away to him! You didn't do it while I was there, and I know you  didn't when I had turned my back.\"    \"Of course you know I didn't,\" I echoed rather testily as I took out a  cigarette. The case reminded me of the night before. But I did not again  hand it to Mrs. Lascelles.    \"Well, then,\" she continued, \"since you didn't give me away, even  without thinking, I want you to know that after all there isn't quite so  much to give away as there might have been.
