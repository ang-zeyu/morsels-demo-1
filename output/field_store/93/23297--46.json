Boy! wilt thou dare disobey me?\" and he raised his clenched hand, while  anger flashed from his eye.    \"Strike! feyther--strike me!\" said the poor lad, bursting into  tears--\"fell me to the 'arth!

Her venerable mother having recovered from the shock of her lost  daughter's sudden appearance, now rose to the assistance of the  unfortunate, and by the aid of restoratives brought poor Mary to the  full sense of her wretchedness. She was speedily conveyed to the same  humble pallet, to which, in the days of her innocence and peace, she had  always retired so light-hearted and joyously, but where she now found a  lasting sleep--an eternal repose!--Yes, poor Mary died!--and having won  the forgiveness and blessing of her offended parents, death was welcome  to her.--_Absurdities: in Prose and Verse_.           *       *       *       *       *        ORIGINS AND INVENTIONS.

Of the origin of these enchanting gardens, Mr. Aubrey, in his  \"Antiquities of Surrey,\" gives us the following account;--\"At Vauxhall,  Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, the inside all of  looking-glass, and fountains very pleasant to behold, which is much  visited by strangers: it stands in the middle of the garden, covered  with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very  well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.\" And  Sir John Hawkins, in his \"History of Music,\" has the following account  of it:--\"The house seems to have been rebuilt since the time that Sir  Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers  became the occupier of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to  it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady  walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being  converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented  by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement  of a _Ridotto al Fresco_, a term which the people of this country had  till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in  the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This  encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical  entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end  he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he  engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one  guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up  an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden,  erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.\" These gardens are said to be the  first of the kind in England; but they are not so old as the Mulberry  Gardens, (on the spot now called Spring Gardens, near St. James's Park,)  where king Charles II. went to regale himself the night after his  restoration, and formed an immediate connexion with Mrs. Palmer,  afterwards Duchess of Cleveland. The trees, however, are more than a  century old, and, according to tradition, were planted for a public  garden. This property was formerly held by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow,  in 1615; and it is highly probable (says Nichols) that she was the  relict of the infamous Guy. In the \"Spectator,\" No. 383, Mr. Addison  introduces a voyage from the Temple Stairs to Vauxhall, in which he is  accompanied by his friend, Sir Roger de Coverley. In the \"Connoisseur,\"  No. 68, we find a very humourous description of the behaviour of an old  penurious citizen, who had treated his family here with a handsome  supper. The magnificence of these gardens calls to recollection the  magic representations in the \"Arabian Nights' Entertainments,\" where        \"The blazing glories, with a cheerful ray,      Supply the sun, and counterfeit the day.\"    Grosely, in his \"Tour to London,\"[4] says, (relating to Ranelagh and  Vauxhall,) \"These entertainments, which begin in the month of May, are  continued every night. They bring together persons of all ranks and  conditions; and amongst these, a considerable number of females, whose  charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence  of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for  business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you  see fathers and mothers, with their children, enjoying domestic  happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert, that  such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of  the levity of the people. Certain it is, that those of Vauxhall and  Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted  without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions  of France. I do not know whether the English are gainers thereby; the  joy which they seem in search of at those places does not beam through  their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at  the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons there seem to say,  what a young English nobleman said to his governor, _Am I as joyous as I  should be?_\"    P. T. W.

(_For the Mirror._)      A cursory glance at the principal occasion of the amazing success  obtained by the Greeks and Romans, in painting and sculpture, during the  early ages, may perhaps prove interesting to the lovers of the arts in  this country.    The elevation to which the arts in Greece arrived was owing to the  concurrence of various circumstances. The imitative arts, we are told,  in that classic country formed a part of the administration, and were  inseparably connected with the heathen worship. The temples were  magnificently erected, and adorned with numerous statues of pagan  deities, before which, in reverential awe, the people prostrated  themselves. Every man of any substance had an idol in his own  habitation, executed by a reputed sculptor. In all public situations the  patriotic actions of certain citizens were represented, that beholders  might be induced to emulate their virtues. On contemplating these  masterpieces of art, which were so truly exquisite that the very coldest  spectator was unable to resist their _almost magical_ influence, the  vicious were reclaimed, and the ignorant stood abashed. Indeed, it has  often been asserted, that the statues by Phidias and Praxiteles were so  inimitably executed, that the people of Paros adored them as living  gods. Those artists who performed such extraordinary wonders as these  were held in an esteemed light, of which we cannot form the least idea.  We are certain they were paid most enormous prices for their  productions, and consequently could afford to adorn them with every  beauty of art, and to bestow more time on them than can ever be expected  from any modern artist.    As soon as the arts had arrived at their highest pitch of excellency in  Greece, the country was laid waste by the invading power of the Romans.  All the Greek cities which contained the greatest treasures were  demolished, and all the pictures[5] and statues fell into the hands of  the victorious general, who had them carefully preserved and conveyed  from the land where they had been adored. Of the estimation in which  these great works were held by the Romans, we may form some idea by the  general assuring a soldier, to whose charge he gave a statue by  Praxiteles, that if he broke it, he should get another as well made in  its place. War is a very destructive enemy to painting and sculpture;  the intestine quarrels which ensued after the Romans had conquered the  country, rendered the exercise of the art impracticable.    The arts were neglected in Rome until the introduction of the popish  religion. At that eventful era, statues and pictures were eagerly sought  for; the admirable Grecian works were appropriated to purposes quite  contrary to their pagan origin, for in many cases heathen deities were  converted into apostles. The labours of Phidias, Myron, Praxiteles,  Lysippus, and Scopas,[6] were highly valued by the Romans, who became  the correct imitators, and in time the rivals, of those celebrated  sculptors. G.W.N.        [5] The pictures alluded to were the works of Apelles,      Apollodorus, and Protogenes.        [6] These sculptors, according to Pliny, were the most reputed      among the ancients.           *      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9883"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 263, (#7)"],[1,"had been more than once humbled, pillaged, and impoverished, but by whom  also her power had been re-erected and restored, not only in Italy, but  in France itself.    Humiliating as the compliance with Bonaparte's request must have seemed  to the more devoted Catholics, Pius VII. had already sacrificed, to  obtain the Concordat, so much of the power and privileges of the Roman  See, that he could hardly have been justified if he had run the risk of  losing the advantages of a treaty so dearly purchased, by declining to  incur some personal trouble, or, it might be termed, some direct  self-abasement. The Pope, and the Cardinals whom he consulted, implored  the illumination of heaven upon their councils; but it was the stern  voice of necessity which assured them, that, except at the risk of  dividing the Church by a schism, they could not refuse to comply with  Bonaparte's requisition. The Pope left Rome on the 5th of November. He  was everywhere received on the road with the highest respect, and most  profound veneration; the Alpine precipices themselves had been secured  by parapets wherever they could expose the venerable Father of the  Catholic Church to danger, or even apprehension. Upon the 25th of  November, he met Bonaparte at Fontainbleau; and the conduct of the  Emperor Napoleon was as studiously respectful towards him, as that of  Charlemagne, whom he was pleased to call his predecessor, could have  been towards Leo.    On the 2nd of December, the ceremony of the coronation took place in  the ancient cathedral of Notre Dame, with the addition of every ceremony  which could be devised to add to its solemnity. Yet we have been told  that the multitude did not participate in the ceremonial with that  eagerness which characterises the inhabitants of all capitals, but  especially those of Paris, upon similar occasions. They had, within a  very few years, seen so many exhibitions, processions, and festivals,  established on the most discordant principles, which, though announced  as permanent and unchangeable, had successively given way to newer  doctrines, that they considered the splendid representation before them  as an unsubstantial pageant, which would fade away in its turn.  Bonaparte himself seemed absent and gloomy, till recalled to a sense of  his grandeur by the voice of the numerous deputies and functionaries  sent up from all the several departments of France, to witness the  coronation. These functionaries had been selected with due attention to  their political opinions; and many of them holding offices under the  government, or expecting benefits from the Emperor, made up, by the  zealous vivacity of their acclamations, for the coldness of the good  citizens of Paris.    The Emperor took his coronation oath, as usual on such occasions, with  his hands up on the scripture, and in the form in which it was repeated  to him by the Pope. But in the act of coronation itself, there was a  marked deviation from the universal custom, characteristic of the man,  the age, and the conjuncture. In all other similar solemnities, the  crown had been placed on the sovereign's head by the presiding spiritual  person, as representing the Deity, by whom princes rule. But not even  from the head of the Catholic Church would Bonaparte consent to receive  as a boon the golden symbol of sovereignty, which he was sensible he  owed solely to his own unparalleled train of military and civil  successes. The crown having been blessed by the Pope, Napoleon took it  from the altar with his own hands, and placed it on his brows. He then  put the diadem on the head of his Empress, as if determined to show that  his authority was the child of his own actions. _Te Deum_ was sung; the  heralds, (for they also had again come into fashion,) proclaimed, \"that  the thrice glorious and thrice august Napoleon, Emperor of the French,  was crowned and installed.\" Thus concluded this remarkable ceremony.  Those who remember having beheld it, must now doubt whether they were  waking, or whether fancy had framed a vision so dazzling in its  appearance, so extraordinary in its origin and progress, and so  ephemeral in its endurance.    The very day before the ceremony of coronation, (that is, on the 1st of  December,) the senate had waited upon the Emperor with the result of the  votes collected in the departments, which, till that time, had been  taken for granted. Upwards of three millions five hundred thousand  citizens had given their votes on this occasion; of whom only about  three thousand five hundred had declared against the proposition. The  vice-president, Neufchateau, declared, \"this report was the unbiassed  expression of the people's choice. No government could plead a title  more authentic.\"    Sir Walter occupies his sixth volume with details of the celebrated  battles that were fought between the French and English armies in the  Spanish territories, and which are told with great truth and develope  the extraordinary powers of this celebrated writer. The divorce of  Josephine, and marriage of Maria Louisa, commence the succeeding volume.  The sterility of Bonaparte's wife was now an irremediable evil; and  political motives were to supersede the ties of endearment, affection,  talents, and virtue. Fouche the minister of police, made Josephine the  means of suggesting to Napoleon, the measure of her own divorce, and  subsequently Napoleon made Josephine acquainted with the cruel  certainty, that the separation was ultimately determined upon.      NAPOLEON DIVORCED FROM JOSEPHINE.    When this sentence had finally dissolved their union, the emperor  retired to St. Cloud, where he lived in seclusion for some days.  Josephine, on her part, took up her residence in the beautiful villa of  Malmaison, near St. Germains. Here she principally dwelt for the  remaining years of her life, which were just prolonged to see the first  fall of her husband; an event which might have been averted had he been  content to listen more frequently to her lessons of moderation. Her life  was chiefly spent in cultivating the fine arts, of which she collected  some beautiful specimens, and in pursuing the science of botany; but  especially in the almost daily practice of acts of benevolence and  charity, of which the English _detenus_, of whom there were several at  St. Germains, frequently shared the benefit. Napoleon visited her very  frequently, and always treated her with the respect to which she was  entitled. He added also to her dowry a third million of francs, that  she might feel no inconvenience from the habits of expense to which it  was her foible to be addicted.      BONAPARTE MARRIES MARIA LOUISA.    This important state measure was no sooner completed, than the great  council was summoned, on the 1st of February, to assist the emperor in  the selection of a new spouse. They were given to understand, that a  match with a grand duchess of Russia had been proposed, but was likely  to be embarrassed by disputes concerning religion. A daughter of the  king of Saxony was also mentioned, but it was easily indicated to the  council that their choice ought to fall upon a princess of the house of  Austria. At the conclusion of the meeting, Eugene, son of the repudiated  Josephine, was commissioned by the council to propose to the Austrian  embassador a match between Napoleon and the archduchess Maria Louisa.  Prince Schwarzenberg had his instructions on the subject; so that the  match was proposed, discussed, and decided in the council, and  afterwards adjusted between plenipotentiaries on either side, in the  space of twenty-four hours. The espousals of Napoleon and Maria Louisa  were celebrated at Vienna, 11th March, 1810. The person of Bonaparte was  represented by his favourite Berthier, while the archduke Charles  assisted at the ceremony, in the name of the emperor Francis. A few days  afterwards, the youthful bride, accompanied by the queen of Naples,  proceeded towards France.    With good taste, Napoleon dispensed with the ceremonies used in the  reception of Marie Antoinette, whose marriage with Louis XVI., though  never named or alluded to, was in other respects the model of the  present solemnity. Near Soissons, a single horseman, no way  distinguished by dress, rode past the carriage in which the young  empress was seated, and had the boldness to return, as if to reconnoitre  more closely. The carriage stopped, the door was opened, and Napoleon,  breaking through all the tediousness of ceremony, introduced himself to  his bride, and came with her to Soissons. The marriage ceremony was  performed at Paris by Bonaparte's uncle, the Cardinal Fesch. The most  splendid rejoicings, illuminations, concerts, festivals, took place upon  this important occasion. But a great calamity occurred, which threw a  shade over these demonstrations of joy. Prince Schwarzenberg had given a  distinguished ball on the occasion, when unhappily the dancing-room,  which was temporary, and erected in the garden, caught fire. No efforts  could stop the progress of the flames, in which several persons  perished, and particularly the sister of Prince Schwarzenberg himself.  This tragic circumstance struck a damp on the public mind, and was  considered as a bad omen, especially when it was remembered that the  marriage of Louis XVI. with a former princess of Austria had been  signalized by a similar disaster.    As a domestic occurrence, nothing could more contribute to Bonaparte's  happiness than his union with Maria Louisa. He was wont to compare her  with Josephine, by giving the latter all the advantages of art and  grace; the former the charms of simple modesty and innocence. His former  empress used every art to support or enhance her personal charms; but  with so much prudence and mystery, that the secret cares of her toilette  could never be traced--her successor trusted for the power of pleasing  to youth and nature.
