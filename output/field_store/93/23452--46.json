First, the egoist calls life a war  without mercy, and then he takes the greatest possible trouble to  drill his enemies in war.  To preach egoism is to practise altruism.  But however it began, the view is common enough in current literature.  The main defence of these thinkers is that they are not thinkers;  they are makers.  They say that choice is itself the divine thing.  Thus Mr. Bernard Shaw has attacked the old idea that men's acts  are to be judged by the standard of the desire of happiness.  He says that a man does not act for his happiness, but from his will.  He does not say, \"Jam will make me happy,\" but \"I want jam.\"  And in all this others follow him with yet greater enthusiasm.  Mr. John Davidson, a remarkable poet, is so passionately excited  about it that he is obliged to write prose.  He publishes a short  play with several long prefaces.  This is natural enough in Mr. Shaw,  for all his plays are prefaces:  Mr. Shaw is (I suspect) the only man  on earth who has never written any poetry.  But that Mr. Davidson (who  can write excellent poetry) should write instead laborious metaphysics  in defence of this doctrine of will, does show that the doctrine  of will has taken hold of men.  Even Mr. H.G.Wells has half spoken  in its language; saying that one should test acts not like a thinker,  but like an artist, saying, \"I FEEL this curve is right,\" or \"that  line SHALL go thus.\"  They are all excited; and well they may be.  For by this doctrine of the divine authority of will, they think they  can break out of the doomed fortress of rationalism.  They think they  can escape.         But they cannot escape.  This pure praise of volition ends  in the same break up and blank as the mere pursuit of logic.  Exactly as complete free thought involves the doubting of thought itself,  so the acceptation of mere \"willing\" really paralyzes the will.  Mr. Bernard Shaw has not perceived the real difference between the old  utilitarian test of pleasure (clumsy, of course, and easily misstated)  and that which he propounds.  The real difference between the test  of happiness and the test of will is simply that the test of  happiness is a test and the other isn't. You can discuss whether  a man's act in jumping over a cliff was directed towards happiness;  you cannot discuss whether it was derived from will.  Of course  it was.  You can praise an action by saying that it is calculated  to bring pleasure or pain to discover truth or to save the soul.  But you cannot praise an action because it shows will; for to say  that is merely to say that it is an action.  By this praise of will  you cannot really choose one course as better than another.  And yet  choosing one course as better than another is the very definition  of the will you are praising.         The worship of will is the negation of will.  To admire mere  choice is to refuse to choose.  If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and  says, \"Will something,\" that is tantamount to saying, \"I do not mind  what you will,\" and that is tantamount to saying, \"I have no will in  the matter.\"  You cannot admire will in general, because the essence  of will is that it is particular. A brilliant anarchist like Mr. John  Davidson feels an irritation against ordinary morality, and therefore  he invokes will--will to anything.  He only wants humanity to want  something. But humanity does want something.  It wants ordinary  morality. He rebels against the law and tells us to will something or  anything. But we have willed something.  We have willed the law  against which he rebels.         All the will-worshippers, from Nietzsche to Mr. Davidson,  are really quite empty of volition.  They cannot will, they can  hardly wish.  And if any one wants a proof of this, it can be found  quite easily.  It can be found in this fact:  that they always talk  of will as something that expands and breaks out.  But it is quite  the opposite.  Every act of will is an act of self-limitation. To  desire action is to desire limitation.  In that sense every act  is an act of self-sacrifice. When you choose anything, you reject  everything else.  That objection, which men of this school used  to make to the act of marriage, is really an objection to every act.  Every act is an irrevocable selection and exclusion.  Just as when  you marry one woman you give up all the others, so when you take  one course of action you give up all the other courses.  If you  become King of England, you give up the post of Beadle in Brompton.  If you go to Rome, you sacrifice a rich suggestive life in Wimbledon.  It is the existence of this negative or limiting side of will that  makes most of the talk of the anarchic will-worshippers little  better than nonsense.  For instance, Mr. John Davidson tells us  to have nothing to do with \"Thou shalt not\"; but it is surely obvious  that \"Thou shalt not\" is only one of the necessary corollaries  of \"I will.\"  \"I will go to the Lord Mayor's Show, and thou shalt  not stop me.\"  Anarchism adjures us to be bold creative artists,  and care for no laws or limits.  But it is impossible to be  an artist and not care for laws and limits.  Art is limitation;  the essence of every picture is the frame.  If you draw a giraffe,  you must draw him with a long neck.  If, in your bold creative way,  you hold yourself free to draw a giraffe with a short neck,  you will really find that you are not free to draw a giraffe.  The moment you step into the world of facts, you step into a world  of limits.  You can free things from alien or accidental laws,  but not from the laws of their own nature.  You may, if you like,  free a tiger from his bars; but do not free him from his stripes.  Do not free a camel of the burden of his hump:  you may be freeing him  from being a camel.  Do not go about as a demagogue, encouraging triangles  to break out of the prison of their three sides.  If a triangle  breaks out of its three sides, its life comes to a lamentable end.  Somebody wrote a work called \"The Loves of the Triangles\";  I never read it, but I am sure that if triangles ever were loved,  they were loved for being triangular.  This is certainly the case  with all artistic creation, which is in some ways the most  decisive example of pure will.  The artist loves his limitations:  they constitute the THING he is doing.  The painter is glad  that the canvas is flat.  The sculptor is glad that the clay  is colourless.         In case the point is not clear, an historic example may illustrate  it.  The French Revolution was really an heroic and decisive thing,  because the Jacobins willed something definite and limited.  They desired the freedoms of democracy, but also all the vetoes  of democracy.  They wished to have votes and NOT to have titles.  Republicanism had an ascetic side in Franklin or Robespierre  as well as an expansive side in Danton or Wilkes.  Therefore they  have created something with a solid substance and shape, the square  social equality and peasant wealth of France.  But since then the  revolutionary or speculative mind of Europe has been weakened by  shrinking from any proposal because of the limits of that proposal.  Liberalism has been degraded into liberality.  Men have tried  to turn \"revolutionise\" from a transitive to an intransitive verb.  The Jacobin could tell you not only the system he would rebel against,  but (what was more important) the system he would NOT rebel against,  the system he would trust.  But the new rebel is a Sceptic,  and will not entirely trust anything.  He has no loyalty; therefore he  can never be really a revolutionist.  And the fact that he doubts  everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything.  For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the  modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces,  but the doctrine by which he denounces it.  Thus he writes one book  complaining that imperial oppression insults the purity of women,  and then he writes another book (about the sex problem) in which he  insults it himself.  He curses the Sultan because Christian girls lose  their virginity, and then curses Mrs. Grundy because they keep it.  As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life,  and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time.  A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant,  and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the  peasant ought to have killed himself.  A man denounces marriage  as a lie, and then denounces aristocratic profligates for treating  it as a lie.  He calls a flag a bauble, and then blames the  oppressors of Poland or Ireland because they take away that bauble.  The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he  complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he  takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting,  where he proves that they practically are beasts.  In short,  the modern revolutionist, being an infinite sceptic, is always  engaged in undermining his own mines.  In his book on politics he  attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he  attacks morality for trampling on men.  Therefore the modern man  in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt.  By rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel  against anything.         It may be added that the same blank and bankruptcy can be observed  in all fierce and terrible types of literature, especially in satire.  Satire may be mad and anarchic, but it presupposes an admitted  superiority in certain things over others; it presupposes a standard.  When little boys in the street laugh at the fatness of some  distinguished journalist, they are unconsciously assuming a standard  of Greek sculpture.  They are appealing to the marble Apollo.  And the curious disappearance of satire from our literature is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#8)"],[1," when Venters struck the trail  of the red herd and found where it had grazed the night before. Then  Venters rested the horse and used his eyes. Near at hand were a cow  and a calf and several yearlings, and farther out in the sage some  straggling steers. He caught a glimpse of coyotes skulking near the  cattle. The slow sweeping gaze of the rider failed to find other living  things within the field of sight. The sage about him was breast-high to  his horse, oversweet with its warm, fragrant breath, gray where it  waved to the light, darker where the wind left it still, and beyond the  wonderful haze-purple lent by distance. Far across that wide waste began  the slow lift of uplands through which Deception Pass cut its tortuous  many-canyoned way.    Venters raised the bridle of his horse and followed the broad cattle  trail. The crushed sage resembled the path of a monster snake. In a few  miles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the  drive. Then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor  of the valley beneath. The opening of the canyon showed in a break of  the sage, and the cattle trail paralleled it as far as he could see.  That trail led to an undiscovered point where Oldring drove cattle  into the pass, and many a rider who had followed it had never returned.  Venters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their  usual course, and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail  and made for the head of the pass.    The sun lost its heat and wore down to the western horizon, where it  changed from white to gold and rested like a huge ball about to roll on  its golden shadows down the slope. Venters watched the lengthening of  the rays and bars, and marveled at his own league-long shadow. The sun  sank. There was instant shading of brightness about him, and he saw a  kind of cold purple bloom creep ahead of him to cross the canyon, to  mount the opposite slope and chase and darken and bury the last golden  flare of sunlight.    Venters rode into a trail that he always took to get down into the  canyon. He dismounted and found no tracks but his own made days  previous. Nevertheless he sent the dog Ring ahead and waited. In a  little while Ring returned. Whereupon Venters led his horse on to the  break in the ground.    The opening into Deception Pass was one of the remarkable natural  phenomena in a country remarkable for vast slopes of sage, uplands  insulated by gigantic red walls, and deep canyons of mysterious source  and outlet. Here the valley floor was level, and here opened a narrow  chasm, a ragged vent in yellow walls of stone. The trail down the five  hundred feet of sheer depth always tested Venters's nerve. It was  bad going for even a burro. But Wrangle, as Venters led him, snorted  defiance or disgust rather than fear, and, like a hobbled horse on the  jump, lifted his ponderous iron-shod fore hoofs and crashed down over  the first rough step. Venters warmed to greater admiration of the  sorrel; and, giving him a loose bridle, he stepped down foot by foot.  Oftentimes the stones and shale started by Wrangle buried Venters to  his knees; again he was hard put to it to dodge a rolling boulder, there  were times when he could not see Wrangle for dust, and once he and the  horse rode a sliding shelf of yellow, weathered cliff. It was a trail  on which there could be no stops, and, therefore, if perilous, it was at  least one that did not take long in the descent.    Venters breathed lighter when that was over, and felt a sudden assurance  in the success of his enterprise. For at first it had been a reckless  determination to achieve something at any cost, and now it resolved  itself into an adventure worthy of all his reason and cunning, and  keenness of eye and ear.    Pinyon pines clustered in little clumps along the level floor of the  pass. Twilight had gathered under the walls. Venters rode into the trail  and up the canyon. Gradually the trees and caves and objects low down  turned black, and this blackness moved up the walls till night enfolded  the pass, while day still lingered above. The sky darkened; and stars  began to show, at first pale and then bright. Sharp notches of the  rim-wall, biting like teeth into the blue, were landmarks by which  Venters knew where his camping site lay. He had to feel his way through  a thicket of slender oaks to a spring where he watered Wrangle and drank  himself. Here he unsaddled and turned Wrangle loose, having no fear that  the horse would leave the thick, cool grass adjacent to the spring. Next  he satisfied his own hunger, fed Ring and Whitie and, with them curled  beside him, composed himself to await sleep.    There had been a time when night in the high altitude of these Utah  uplands had been satisfying to Venters. But that was before the  oppression of enemies had made the change in his mind. As a rider  guarding the herd he had never thought of the night's wildness and  loneliness; as an outcast, now when the full silence set in, and the  deep darkness, and trains of radiant stars shone cold and calm, he  lay with an ache in his heart. For a year he had lived as a black fox,  driven from his kind. He longed for the sound of a voice, the touch of  a hand. In the daytime there was riding from place to place, and the  gun practice to which something drove him, and other tasks that at least  necessitated action, at night, before he won sleep, there was strife in  his soul. He yearned to leave the endless sage slopes, the wilderness  of canyons, and it was in the lonely night that this yearning grew  unbearable. It was then that he reached forth to feel Ring or Whitie,  immeasurably grateful for the love and companionship of two dogs.    On this night the same old loneliness beset Venters, the old habit  of sad thought and burning unquiet had its way. But from it evolved a  conviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change. He had  sensed it first when Wrangle swung him up to the high saddle, he knew  it now when he lay in the gateway of Deception Pass. He had no thrill of  adventure, rather a gloomy perception of great hazard, perhaps death. He  meant to find Oldring's retreat. The rustlers had fast horses, but none  that could catch Wrangle. Venters knew no rustler could creep upon him  at night when Ring and Whitie guarded his hiding-place. For the rest, he  had eyes and ears, and a long rifle and an unerring aim, which he meant  to use. Strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought  of the killing of Tull. It related only to what was to happen to him in  Deception Pass; and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than  tell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon. Moreover, he did  not care. And at length, tired out by stress of thought, he fell asleep.    When his eyes unclosed, day had come again, and he saw the rim of the  opposite wall tipped with the gold of sunrise. A few moments sufficed  for the morning's simple camp duties. Near at hand he found Wrangle,  and to his surprise the horse came to him. Wrangle was one of the horses  that left his viciousness in the home corral. What he wanted was to be  free of mules and burros and steers, to roll in dust-patches, and then  to run down the wide, open, windy sage-plains, and at night browse and  sleep in the cool wet grass of a springhole. Jerd knew the sorrel when  he said of him, \"Wait till he smells the sage!\"    Venters saddled and led him out of the oak thicket, and, leaping  astride, rode up the canyon, with Ring and Whitie trotting behind. An  old grass-grown trail followed the course of a shallow wash where flowed  a thin stream of water. The canyon was a hundred rods wide, its yellow  walls were perpendicular; it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak  and pinon. For five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing,  and then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the  floor. Beyond this point of sudden change in the character of the  canyon Venters had never explored, and here was the real door to the  intricacies of Deception Pass.    He reined Wrangle to a walk, halted now and then to listen, and then  proceeded cautiously with shifting and alert gaze. The canyon assumed  proportions that dwarfed those of its first ten miles. Venters rode on  and on, not losing in the interest of his wide surroundings any of his  caution or keen search for tracks or sight of living thing. If there  ever had been a trail here, he could not find it. He rode through sage  and clumps of pinon trees and grassy plots where long-petaled purple  lilies bloomed. He rode through a dark constriction of the pass no wider  than the lane in the grove at Cottonwoods. And he came out into a great  amphitheater into which jutted huge towering corners of a confluence of  intersecting canyons.    Venters sat his horse, and, with a rider's eye, studied this wild  cross-cut of huge stone gullies. Then he went on, guided by the course  of running water. If it had not been for the main stream of water  flowing north he would never have been able to tell which of those many  openings was a continuation of the pass. In crossing this amphitheater  he went by the mouths of five canyons, fording little streams that  flowed into the larger one. Gaining the outlet which he took to be the  pass, he rode on again under over hanging walls. One side was dark in  shade, the other light in sun. This narrow passageway turned and twisted  and opened into a valley that amazed Venters.    Here again was a sweep of purple sage, richer than upon the higher  levels. The valley was miles long, several wide, and inclosed by  unscalable walls. But it was the background of this valley that so  forcibly struck him. Across the sage-flat rose a strange up-flinging of  yellow rocks. He could not tell which were close and which were distant.  Scrawled mounds of stone, like mountain waves, seemed to roll "]]]
