[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#8)"],[1,"several kinds of caterpillar and grub, which eat into books,  those with legs are the larvae of moths; those without legs, or rather  with rudimentary legs, are grubs and turn to beetles.    It is not known whether any species of caterpillar or grub can live  generation after generation upon books alone, but several sorts of  wood-borers, and others which live upon vegetable refuse, will attack  paper, especially if attracted in the first place by the real wooden  boards in which it was the custom of the old book-binders to clothe  their volumes. In this belief, some country librarians object to opening  the library windows lest the enemy should fly in from the neighbouring  woods, and rear a brood of worms. Anyone, indeed, who has seen a hole  in a filbert, or a piece of wood riddled by dry rot, will recognize a  similarity of appearance in the channels made by these insect enemies.    Among the paper-eating species are:--    1. The \"Anobium.\" Of this beetle there are varieties, viz.: \"A.  pertinax,\" \"A. eruditus,\" and \"A. paniceum.\" In the larval state they  are grubs, just like those found, in nuts; in this stage they are too  much alike to be distinguished from one another. They feed on old dry  wood, and often infest bookcases and shelves. They eat the wooden boards  of old books, and so pass into the paper where they make long holes  quite round, except when they work in a slanting direction, when the  holes appear to be oblong. They will thus pierce through several volumes  in succession, Peignot, the well-known bibliographer, having found  27 volumes so pierced in a straight line by one worm, a miracle of  gluttony, the story of which, for myself, I receive \"_cum grano salis_.\"  After a certain time the larva changes into a pupa, and then emerges as  a small brown beetle.    2. \"Oecophora.\"--This larva is similar in size to that of Anobium, but  can be distinguished at once by having legs. It is a caterpillar, with  six legs upon its thorax and eight sucker-like protuberances on its  body, like a silk-worm. It changes into a chrysalis, and then assumes  its perfect shape as a small brown moth. The species that attacks books  is the OEcophora pseudospretella. It loves damp and warmth, and eats any  fibrous material. This caterpillar is quite unlike any garden species,  and, excepting the legs, is very similar in appearance and size to the  Anobium. It is about half-inch long, with a horny head and strong jaws.  To printers' ink or writing ink he appears to have no great dislike,  though I imagine that the former often disagrees with his health, unless  he is very robust, as in books where the print is pierced a majority of  the worm-holes I have seen are too short in extent to have provided food  enough for the development of the grub. But, although the ink may be  unwholesome, many grubs survive, and, eating day and night in silence  and darkness, work out their destiny leaving, according to the strength  of their constitutions, a longer or shorter tunnel in the volume.    In December, 1879, Mr. Birdsall, a well-known book-binder of  Northampton, kindly sent me by post a fat little Worm, which had been  found by one of his workmen in an old book while being bound. He bore  his journey extremely well, being very lively when turned out. I placed  him in a box in warmth and quiet, with some small fragments of paper  from a Boethius, printed by Caxton, and a leaf of a seventeenth century  book. He ate a small piece of the leaf, but either from too much fresh  air, from unaccustomed liberty, or from change of food, he gradually  weakened, and died in about three weeks. I was sorry to lose him, as I  wished to verify his name in his perfect state. Mr. Waterhouse, of the  Entomological department of the British Museum, very kindly examined him  before death, and was of opinion he was OEcophora pseudospretella.    In July, 1885, Dr. Garnett, of the British Museum, gave me two worms  which had been found in an old Hebrew Commentary just received from  Athens. They had doubtless had a good shaking on the journey, and one  was moribund when I took charge, and joined his defunct kindred in a  few days. The other seemed hearty and lived with me for nearly eighteen  months. I treated him as well as I knew how; placed him in a small box  with the choice of three sorts of old paper to eat, and very seldom  disturbed him. He evidently resented his confinement, ate very little,  moved very little, and changed in appearance very little, even when  dead. This Greek worm, filled with Hebrew lore, differed in many  respects from any other I have seen. He was longer, thinner, and more  delicate looking than any of his English congeners. He was transparent,  like thin ivory, and had a dark line through his body, which I took  to be the intestinal canal. He resigned his life with extreme  procrastination, and died \"deeply lamented\" by his keeper, who had long  looked forward to his final development.    The difficulty of breeding these worms is probably due to their  formation. When in a state of nature they can by expansion and  contraction of the body working upon the sides of their holes, push  their horny jaws against the opposing mass of paper. But when freed from  the restraint, which indeed to them is life, they CANNOT eat although  surrounded with food, for they have no legs to keep them steady, and  their natural, leverage is wanting.    Considering the numerous old books contained in the British Museum, the  Library there is wonderfully free from the worm. Mr. Rye, lately  the Keeper of the Printed Books there, writes me \"Two or three were  discovered in my time, but they were weakly creatures. One, I remember,  was conveyed into the Natural History Department, and was taken into  custody by Mr. Adam White who pronounced it to be Anobium pertinax. I  never heard of it after.\"    The reader, who has not had an opportunity of examining old libraries,  can have no idea of the dreadful havoc which these pests are capable of  making.    I have now before me a fine folio volume, printed on very good  unbleached paper, as thick as stout cartridge, in the year 1477, by  Peter Schoeffer, of Mentz. Unfortunately, after a period of neglect in  which it suffered severely from the \"worm,\" it was about fifty years ago  considered worth a new cover, and so again suffered severely, this time  at the hands of the binder. Thus the original state of the boards is  unknown, but the damage done to the leaves can be accurately described.    The \"worms\" have attacked each end. On the first leaf are 212 distinct  holes, varying in size from a common pin hole to that which a stout  knitting-needle would make, say, <1/16> to <1/23> inch. These holes run  mostly in lines more or less at right angles with the covers, a very few  being channels along the paper affecting three or four sheets only. The  varied energy of these little pests is thus represented:--        On folio 1 are 212 holes.  On folio 61 are 4 holes.          \"   11  \"   57   \"         \"    71  \"  2   \"          \"   21  \"   48   \"         \"    81  \"  2   \"          \"   31  \"   31   \"         \"    87  \"  1   \"          \"   41  \"   18   \"         \"    90  \"  0   \"          \"   51  \"    6   \"      These 90 leaves being stout, are about the thickness of 1 inch. The  volume has 250 leaves, and turning to the end, we find on the last leaf  81 holes, made by a breed of worms not so ravenous. Thus,          From end                |         From end.   On folio 1 are 81 holes.     |    On folio 66 is 1 hole.       \"   11 \"   40   \"        |         \"   69   \"   0   \"      It is curious to notice how the holes, rapidly at first, and then slowly  and more slowly, disappear. You trace the same hole leaf after leaf,  until suddenly the size becomes in one leaf reduced to half its normal  diameter, and a close examination will show a small abrasion of the  paper in the next leaf exactly where the hole would have come if  continued. In the book quoted it is just as if there had been a race. In  the first ten leaves the weak worms are left behind; in the second ten  there are still forty-eight eaters; these are reduced to thirty-one in  the third ten, and to only eighteen in the fourth ten. On folio 51 only  six worms hold on, and before folio 61 two of them have given in.  Before reaching folio 7, it is a neck and neck race between two sturdy  gourmands, each making a fine large hole, one of them being oval in  shape. At folio 71 they are still neck and neck, and at folio 81 the  same. At folio 87 the oval worm gives in, the round one eating three  more leaves and part way through the fourth. The leaves of the book are  then untouched until we reach the sixty-ninth from the end, upon which  is one worm hole. After this they go on multiplying to the end of the  book.    I have quoted this instance because I have it handy, but many worms  eat much longer holes than any in this volume; some I have seen  running quite through a couple of thick volumes, covers and all. In the  \"Schoeffer\" book the holes are probably the work of Anobium pertinax,  because the centre is spared and both ends attacked. Originally, real  wooden boards were the covers of the volume, and here, doubtless, the  attack was commenced, which was carried through each board into the  paper of the book.    I remember well my first visit to the Bodleian Library, in the year  1858, Dr. Bandinel being then the librarian. He was very kind, and  afforded me every facility for examining the fine collection of  \"Caxtons,\" which was the object of my journey. In looking over a parcel  of black-letter fragments, which had been in a drawer for a long time, I  came across a small grub, which, without a thought, I threw on the floor  and trod under foot. Soon after I found another, a fat, glossy fellow,  so long ---, which I carefully preserved in a little paper box,  intending to observe his habits and development. Seeing Dr. Bandinel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#8)"],[1,"as yet appeared. But we know the Mary  Pickford mood. When it is gentlest, most roguish, most exalted, it is a  prophecy of what this type should be, not only in the actress, but in the  scenario and setting.    Mary Pickford can be a doll, a village belle, or a church angel. Her  powers as a doll are hinted at in the title of the production: Such a  Little Queen. I remember her when she was a village belle in that film  that came out before producers or actors were known by name. It was  sugar-sweet. It was called: What the Daisy Said. If these productions had  conformed to their titles sincerely, with the highest photoplay art we  would have had two more examples for this chapter.    Why do the people love Mary? Not on account of the Daniel Frohman style  of handling her appearances. He presents her to us in what are almost the  old-fashioned stage terms: the productions energetic and full of  painstaking detail but dominated by a dream that is a theatrical hybrid.  It is neither good moving picture nor good stage play. Yet Mary could be  cast as a cloudy Olympian or a church angel if her managers wanted her to  be such. She herself was transfigured in the Dawn of Tomorrow, but the  film-version of that play was merely a well mounted melodrama.    Why do the people love Mary? Because of a certain aspect of her face in  her highest mood. Botticelli painted her portrait many centuries ago  when by some necromancy she appeared to him in this phase of herself.  There is in the Chicago Art Institute at the top of the stairs on the  north wall a noble copy of a fresco by that painter, the copy by Mrs.  MacMonnies. It is very near the Winged Victory of Samothrace. In the  picture the muses sit enthroned. The loveliest of them all is a startling  replica of Mary.    The people are hungry for this fine and spiritual thing that Botticelli  painted in the faces of his muses and heavenly creatures. Because the mob  catch the very glimpse of it in Mary's face, they follow her night after  night in the films. They are never quite satisfied with the plays,  because the managers are not artists enough to know they should sometimes  put her into sacred pictures and not have her always the village hoyden,  in plays not even hoydenish. But perhaps in this argument I have but  betrayed myself as Mary's infatuated partisan.    So let there be recorded here the name of another actress who is always  in the intimate-and-friendly mood and adapted to close-up interiors,  Marguerite Clark. She is endowed by nature to act, in the same film, the  eight-year-old village pet, the irrepressible sixteen-year-old, and  finally the shining bride of twenty. But no production in which she acts  that has happened to come under my eye has done justice to these  possibilities. The transitions from one of these stages to the other are  not marked by the producer with sufficient delicate graduation, emphasis,  and contrast. Her plots have been but sugared nonsense, or swashbuckling  ups and downs. She shines in a bevy of girls. She has sometimes been  given the bevy.    But it is easier to find performers who fit this chapter, than to find  films. Having read so far, it is probably not quite nine o'clock in the  evening. Go around the corner to the nearest theatre. You will not be apt  to find a pure example of the Intimate-and-friendly Moving Picture, but  some one or two scenes will make plain the intent of the phrase. Imagine  the most winsome tableau that passes before you, extended logically  through one or three reels, with no melodramatic interruptions or awful  smashes. For a further discussion of these smashes, and other items in  this chapter, read the ninth chapter, entitled \"Painting-in-Motion.\"          CHAPTER IV    THE MOTION PICTURE OF FAIRY SPLENDOR      Again, kind reader, let us assume it is eight o'clock in the evening, for  purposes of future climax which you no doubt anticipate.    Just as the Action Motion Picture has its photographic basis in the race  down the high-road, just as the Intimate Motion Picture has its  photographic basis in the close-up interior scene, so the Photoplay of  Splendor, in its four forms, is based on the fact that the kinetoscope  can take in the most varied of out-of-door landscapes. It can reproduce  fairy dells. It can give every ripple of the lily-pond. It can show us  cathedrals within and without. It can take in the panorama of cyclopaean  cloud, bending forest, storm-hung mountain. In like manner it can put on  the screen great impersonal mobs of men. It can give us tremendous  armies, moving as oceans move. The pictures of Fairy Splendor, Crowd  Splendor, Patriotic Splendor, and Religious Splendor are but the  embodiments of these backgrounds.    And a photographic corollary quite useful in these four forms is that the  camera has a kind of Hallowe'en witch-power. This power is the subject of  this chapter.    The world-old legends and revelations of men in connection with the  lovely out of doors, or lonely shrines, or derived from inspired  crusading humanity moving in masses, can now be fitly retold. Also the  fairy wand can do its work, the little dryad can come from the tree. And  the spirits that guard the Republic can be seen walking on the clouds  above the harvest-fields.    But we are concerned with the humblest voodooism at present.    Perhaps the world's oldest motion picture plot is a tale in Mother Goose.  It ends somewhat in this fashion:--        The old lady said to the cat:--      \"Cat, cat, kill rat.      Rat will not gnaw rope,      Rope will not hang butcher,      Butcher will not kill ox,      Ox will not drink water,      Water will not quench fire,      Fire will not burn stick,      Stick will not beat dog,      Dog will not bite pig,      Pig will not jump over the stile,      And I cannot get home to-night.\"    By some means the present writer does not remember, the cat was persuaded  to approach the rat. The rest was like a tale of European diplomacy:--        The rat began to gnaw the rope,      The rope began to hang the butcher,      The butcher began to kill the ox,      The ox began to drink the water,      The water began to quench the fire,      The fire began to burn the stick,      The stick began to beat the dog,      The dog began to bite the pig,      The frightened little pig jumped over the stile,      And the old lady was able to get home that night.    Put yourself back to the state of mind in which you enjoyed this bit of  verse.    Though the photoplay fairy-tale may rise to exquisite heights, it begins  with pictures akin to this rhyme. Mankind in his childhood has always  wanted his furniture to do such things. Arthur names his blade  Excalibur. It becomes a person. The man in the Arabian tale speaks to  the magic carpet. It carries him whithersoever he desires. This yearning  for personality in furniture begins to be crudely worked upon in the  so-called trick-scenes. The typical commercialized comedy of this sort is  Moving Day. Lyman H. Howe, among many excellent reels of a different  kind, has films allied to Moving Day.    But let us examine at this point, as even more typical, an old Pathe Film  from France. The representatives of the moving-firm are sent for. They  appear in the middle of the room with an astonishing jump. They are told  that this household desires to have its goods and hearthstone gods  transplanted two streets east. The agents salute. They disappear. Yet  their wireless orders are obeyed with a military crispness. The books and  newspapers climb out of the window. They go soberly down the street. In  their wake are the dishes from the table. Then the more delicate  porcelains climb down the shelves and follow. Then follow the  hobble-de-hoy kitchen dishes, then the chairs, then the clothing, and the  carpets from over the house. The most joyous and curious spectacle is to  behold the shoes walking down the boulevard, from father's large boots  to those of the youngest child. They form a complete satire of the  family, yet have a masterful air of their own, as though they were the  most important part of a human being.    The new apartment is shown. Everything enters in procession. In contrast  to the general certainty of the rest, one or two pieces of furniture grow  confused trying to find their places. A plate, in leaping upon a high  shelf, misses and falls broken. The broom and dustpan sweep up the  pieces, and consign them to the dustbin. Then the human family comes in,  delighted to find everything in order. The moving agents appear and  salute. They are paid their fee. They salute again and disappear with  another gigantic leap.    The ability to do this kind of a thing is fundamental in the destinies of  the art. Yet this resource is neglected because its special province is  not understood. \"People do not like to be tricked,\" the manager says.  Certainly they become tired of mere contraptions. But they never grow  weary of imagination. There is possible many a highly imaginative  fairy-tale on this basis if we revert to the sound principles of the  story of the old lady and the pig.    Moving Day is at present too crassly material. It has not the touch of  the creative imagination. We are overwhelmed with a whole van of  furniture. Now the mechanical or non-human object, beginning with the  engine in the second chapter, is apt to be the hero in most any sort of  photoplay while the producer remains utterly unconscious of the fact. Why  not face this idiosyncrasy of the camera and make the non-human object  the hero indeed? Not by filling the story with ropes, buckets,  fire-brands, and sticks, but by having these four unique. Make the fire  the loveliest of torches, the water the most graceful of springs. Let the  rope be the humorist. Let the stick be the outstanding hero, the  D'Artagnan of the group, full of queer gestures and hoppings about. Let  him be both polite and obdurate. Finally let him beat"]]]
