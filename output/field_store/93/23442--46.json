Supposing they were following up the  largest trail, I rode for the herd, where Flood and two of the boys  had about twelve hundred cattle. From a comparison of notes, our  foreman was able to account for all the men with the exception of two,  and as these proved to be Blades and Priest, I could give him a  satisfactory explanation as to their probable whereabouts. On my  report of having sighted the wagon and _remuda_, Flood at once ordered  me to meet and hurry them in, as not only he, but Strayhorn and  Officer, were badly in need of a change of mounts.    I learned from McCann, who was doing the trailing from the wagon, that  the regular trail was to the west, the herd having crossed it within a  quarter of a mile after leaving the bed ground. Joining Honeyman, I  took the first horse which came within reach of my rope, and with a  fresh mount under me, we rushed the saddle horses past the wagon and  shortly came up with our foreman. There we rounded in the horses as  best we could without the aid of the wagon, and before McCann arrived,  all had fresh mounts and were ready for orders. This was my first trip  on the trail, and I was hungry and thirsty enough to hope something  would be said about eating, but that seemed to be the last idea in our  foreman's mind. Instead, he ordered me to take the two other boys with  me, and after putting them on the trail of the bunch which The Rebel  and Blades were following, to drift in what cattle we had held on our  left. But as we went, we managed to encounter the wagon and get a  drink and a canteen of water from McCann before we galloped away on  our mission. After riding a mile or so together, we separated, and on  my arrival at the nearest bunch, I found Roundtree and Stallings  coming up with the larger holding. Throwing the two hunches together,  we drifted them a free clip towards camp. We soon sighted the main  herd, and saw across to our right and about five miles distant two of  our men bringing in another hunch. As soon as we turned our cattle  into the herd, Flood ordered me, on account of my light weight, to  meet this bunch, find out where the last cattle were, and go to their  assistance.    With a hungry look in the direction of our wagon, I obeyed, and on  meeting Durham and Borrowstone, learned that the outside bunch on the  right, which had got into the regular trail, had not been checked  until daybreak. All they knew about their location was that the up  stage from Oakville had seen two men with Circle Dot cattle about five  miles below, and had sent up word by the driver that they had  something like four hundred head. With this meagre information, I rode  away in the direction where one would naturally expect to find our  absent men, and after scouring the country for an hour, sighted a  single horseman on an elevation, whom from the gray mount I knew for  Quince Forrest. He was evidently on the lookout for some one to pilot  them in. They had been drifting like lost sheep ever since dawn, but  we soon had their cattle pointed in the right direction, and Forrest  taking the lead, Quarternight and I put the necessary push behind  them. Both of them cursed me roundly for not bringing them a canteen  of water, though they were well aware that in an emergency like the  present, our foreman would never give a thought to anything but the  recovery of the herd. Our comfort was nothing; men were cheap, but  cattle cost money.    We reached the camp about two o'clock, and found the outfit cutting  out range cattle which had been absorbed into the herd during the run.  Throwing in our contingent, we joined in the work, and though Forrest  and Quarternight were as good as afoot, there were no orders for a  change of mounts, to say nothing of food and drink. Several hundred  mixed cattle were in the herd, and after they had been cut out, we  lined our cattle out for a count. In the absence of Priest, Flood and  John Officer did the counting, and as the hour of the day made the  cattle sluggish, they lined through between the counters as though  they had never done anything but walk in their lives. The count showed  sixteen short of twenty-eight hundred, which left us yet over three  hundred out. But good men were on their trail, and leaving two men on  herd, the rest of us obeyed the most welcome orders of the day when  Flood intimated that we would \"eat a bite and go after the rest.\"    As we had been in our saddles since one or two o'clock the morning  before, it is needless to add that our appetites were equal to the  spread which our cook had waiting for us. Our foreman, as though  fearful of the loss of a moment's time, sent Honeyman to rustle in the  horses before we had finished our dinners. Once the _remuda_ was  corralled, under the rush of a tireless foreman, dinner was quickly  over, and fresh horses became the order of the moment. The Atascosa,  our nearest water, lay beyond the regular trail to the west, and  leaving orders for the outfit to drift the herd into it and water,  Flood and myself started in search of our absent men, not forgetting  to take along two extra horses as a remount for Blades and Priest. The  leading of these extra horses fell to me, but with the loose end of a  rope in Jim Flood's hand as he followed, it took fast riding to keep  clear of them.    After reaching the trail of the missing cattle, our foreman set a pace  for five or six miles which would have carried us across the Nueces by  nightfall, and we were only checked by Moss Strayhorn riding in on an  angle and intercepting us in our headlong gait. The missing cattle  were within a mile of us to the right, and we turned and rode to them.  Strayhorn explained to us that the cattle had struck some recent  fencing on their course, and after following down the fence several  miles had encountered an offset, and the angle had held the squad  until The Rebel and Blades overtook them. When Officer and he reached  them, they were unable to make any accurate count, because of the  range cattle amongst them, and they had considered it advisable to  save horseflesh, and not cut them until more help was available. When  we came up with the cattle, my bunkie and Blades looked wistfully at  our saddles, and anticipating their want, I untied my slicker, well  remembering the reproof of Quarternight and Forrest, and produced a  full canteen of water,--warm of course, but no less welcome.    No sooner were saddles shifted than we held up the bunch, cut out the  range cattle, counted, and found we had some three hundred and thirty  odd Circle Dots,--our number more than complete. With nothing now  missing, Flood took the loose horses and two of the boys with him and  returned to the herd, leaving three of us behind to bring in this last  contingent of our stampeded cattle. This squad were nearly all large  steers, and had run fully twenty miles, before, thanks to an angle in  a fence, they had been checked. As our foreman galloped away, leaving  us behind, Bob Blades said,--    \"Hasn't the boss got a wiggle on himself today! If he'd made this old  world, he'd have made it in half a day, and gone fishing in the  afternoon--if his horses had held out.\"    We reached the Atascosa shortly after the arrival of the herd, and  after holding the cattle on the water for an hour, grazed them the  remainder of the evening, for if there was any virtue in their having  full stomachs, we wanted to benefit from it. While grazing that  evening, we recrossed the trail on an angle, and camped in the most  open country we could find, about ten miles below our camp of the  night before. Every precaution was taken to prevent a repetition of  the run; our best horses were chosen for night duty, as our regular  ones were too exhausted; every advantage of elevation for a bed ground  was secured, and thus fortified against accident, we went into camp  for the night. But the expected never happens on the trail, and the  sun arose the next morning over our herd grazing in peace and  contentment on the flowery prairies which border on the Atascosa.        CHAPTER V    A DRY DRIVE    Our cattle quieted down nicely after this run, and the next few weeks  brought not an incident worth recording. There was no regular trail  through the lower counties, so we simply kept to the open country.  Spring had advanced until the prairies were swarded with grass and  flowers, while water, though scarcer, was to be had at least once  daily. We passed to the west of San Antonio--an outfitting point which  all herds touched in passing northward--and Flood and our cook took  the wagon and went in for supplies. But the outfit with the herd kept  on, now launched on a broad, well-defined trail, in places  seventy-five yards wide, where all local trails blent into the one  common pathway, known in those days as the Old Western Trail. It is  not in the province of this narrative to deal with the cause or origin  of this cattle trail, though it marked the passage of many hundred  thousand cattle which preceded our Circle Dots, and was destined to  afford an outlet to several millions more to follow. The trail proper  consisted of many scores of irregular cow paths, united into one broad  passageway, narrowing and widening as conditions permitted, yet ever  leading northward. After a few years of continued use, it became as  well defined as the course of a river.    Several herds which had started farther up country were ahead of ours,  and this we considered an advantage, for wherever one herd could go,  it was reasonable that others could follow. Flood knew the trail as  well as any of the other foremen, but there was one thing he had not  taken into consideration: the drouth of the preceding summer. True,  there had been local spring showers, sufficient to start the grass  nicely, but water in such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#8)"],[1," the cold black  night, over the mountains, down the ravines and gullies, eagerly hunting  for His lost man, getting hands, and face, and more, torn on the brambly  thorn bushes, and losing His life, in the darkness, on a tree thrust in  His path, but saving the man.          The Plan for Jesus' Coming        <u>The Image of God.</u>      Man is God's darling--the king and crown of creation. The whole creation  was made for him to develop and rule over and enjoy. He is in a class by  himself. When he made his bad break there was just one thing left to do.  God must get a new leader for His man to lead him back into all the  original plan for himself. Of the whole earth man stood next to God  Himself. God could not find that leader lower down. So He went higher.  Jesus is God giving the race a new Leader who would withstand the lure of  temptation and realize the ambition of God's heart for His darling.    The man was made in the image of God, for self-mastery, and through  self-mastery for dominion over all of God's creation. That was the plan  for the man. That, too, is the plan for the new Man. There is only one  place to go to find God's plan for the coming One. That is in the Hebrew  half of the Bible. One can hardly believe, unless he has been through the  thing, how hard it is to get out of the Old Testament its vision of the  coming One without any coloring from the New getting into his eyes.    We have been reading the Old Testament _through_ the events of the New  for so long that it gives a severe mental wrench to try to do anything  else. Yet only so, be it sharply marked, can the plan for the coming of  Jesus be gotten, and, further, only so can Jesus be understood. One must  attempt to do just that to understand at all fairly what a reverent Hebrew  in prophetic times expected; what such earnest Hebrews as Simeon and Anna  were looking for.    I have tried to make a faithful effort to shut severely out of view the  familiar facts of the gospel story for my own sake, to try to understand  God's plan as it stood before there was a gospel story.    This old Hebrew picture is so full of details that are found in the  reality that one who has not actually gone studiously over the Old  separately will be very likely to think that the New Testament details are  being _read into_ the Old. If that be so, it is urgently requested that  such an opinion be held off until the old Hebrew pages have been carefully  examined as outlined in the study notes, that you may get the refreshment  of a great surprise.    It must be kept keenly in mind that there is a difference between God's  plan and that which He knows ahead will occur. Sovereignty does not mean  that everything God plans comes to pass. Nor that everything that comes to  pass is God's plan. Clearly it has not been so. It _does_ mean that  through very much that is utterly contrary to His plan He works out, in  the long run, His great purpose. He works His own purpose out of a tough  tangled network of contrary purposes; but in doing it never infringes upon  man's liberty of action. He yields and bends, and, with a patience beyond  our comprehension, waits, that in the end He may win _through_ our  consent. And so not only is His purpose saved, but man is saved and  character is made in the process.    The plan is a detail of the purpose. There is one unfailing purpose  through continual breakings of the plan. God's purpose remains unchanging  through all changes. Yet here not only is His purpose unbroken, but His  plan is to work out in the end unbroken too, though suffering a very  serious break midway.    The plan goes back to the first broken plan. There was dominion or  kingship of the earth by a masterful man bearing the image and imprint of  God. All this was lost. Through loss of contact with God came the blurring  of the image and the loss of self-mastery. Through loss of these came loss  of dominion. These are to be restored--all three. This is the key to the  plan for the coming of Jesus. A universal dominion, under the lead of a  Master-Man, in God's image, and through these a restoration of blessing to  all the earth of men. This is the one continuous theme of the old Hebrew  writings. The emphasis swings now to one aspect, now to another, but  through all the one thought is a king, a world-wide kingdom bringing  blessing to all creation.    But if Jesus was to lead man back He must first get alongside, close up,  on the same level. This was the toughest part of the whole thing. The  hardest part in saving a man is getting the man's consent to be saved.  There is no task tougher than trying to help a man who thinks he doesn't  need help, even though his need may be extreme. You may throw a blanket  over a horse's head and get it out of a burning stable or barn; or a lasso  over a bull's head to get it where you want, but man cannot be handled  that way. He must be _led_. The tether that draws must be fastened inside,  his _will_. He must be lifted from inside. That is a bit of the God-image  in him. And so God's most difficult task was getting _inside the man_ that  had shut Him out.        <u>Fastening a Tether Inside.</u>      And a long time it took. That it took so long, measured by the calendar,  suggests how great was the resistance to be overcome. A long round-about  road it does seem that God took. Yet it was the shortest. The circle route  is always the shortest. It is nature's way. Nature always follows the line  of least resistance. The eagle, descending, comes in circles, the line of  least resistance. Water running out of a bowl through the hole in the  bottom follows the circuitous route--the easiest.    God's longest way around was the shortest way into man's heart. Standards  had to be changed. New standards made. Yet in making a standard there must  be a starting point. God's bother was to get a starting point. When man  was too impure in his ingrained ideas to receive any idea of what purity  meant, things were in bad shape. When he was grubbing content in the  gutter, how was he ever to be gotten up to the highlands, when you  couldn't even lift his eyes over the curbstone? All the prohibitions of  the Mosaic code are but faithful mirrors of man's condition. A wholly new  standard had to be set up. That was God's task. It must be set up  _through_ men if they were to be attracted to it. So God started on His  longest-way-around-shortest road into man's heart.    A man is chosen. Through this man, by the slow processes of generations, a  nation is grown. Yet a nation only in numbers at first; in no other sense;  a mob of men. Then this mob is worked upon. They are led through  experiences that will make them soft to new impressions. Then slowly,  laboriously, by child-training methods, the new standard is brought to  them. Yet after centuries the best attained is only that their tenacious  fingers have hold of a _form_, not yet the spirit. Yet this is an immense  gain.    By and by this is the pedigree: A man, a family, tribes, a nation, a  strong nation, a broken nation, a literature, ragged remnants of a nation,  an ideal the like of which could not be found anywhere on earth, and a  _book_ embodying that ideal written as with acid-point in metal, as with  sharpest chisel in hardest stone.    At last a start was made. God had gotten a hook inside man's will to  which He could tie His tether, and _draw_, lovingly, tenderly,  tenaciously, persistently, _draw_ up out of the mire, toward the  highlands, toward Himself.        <u>The First Touches on the Canvas.</u>      This old Hebrew picture is found to be a mosaic made up of bits gathered  here and there, scattered throughout the Book. Some of the bits are of  very quiet sober colors found in obscure corners. Others are bright. When  brought together all blend into one with wondrous, fine beauty. The first  bit is of grave hue. It comes at the very beginning. There is to be sharp  enmity, then a crisis, resulting in a fatal wound for the head of evil,  with scars for the victor.    After this earliest general statement there are three distinct groups or  periods of prediction regarding the coming One. During the making of the  nation, during its high tide of strength and glory under David and his  son, during the time of its going to pieces. As the national glory is  departing, the vision takes on its most glorious coloring. The first of  these is during the making of the nation. As the man who is to be father  of the chosen family is called away from his kinfolk to a preparatory  isolation, he is cheered with the promise that his relationship is to be a  relationship of leadership and of great blessing _to the whole earth_.  This is repeated to his son and to his grandson, as each in turn becomes  head of the family. As his grandson, the father of the twelve men whose  names become the tribe names, is passing away he prophetically sees the  coming leadership narrowed to Judah, through whom the great Leader is to  come.    Later yet, in a story of divination and superstition characteristic of the  time, a strange prophet is hired by an enemy to pronounce a curse upon the  new nation. This diviner is taken possession of by the Spirit of God, and  forced to utter what is clearly against his own mercenary desires. He sees  a coming One, in the future, who is to smite Israel's enemies and rule  victoriously.    During the last days of Moses that man, great to the whole race, speaks a  word that sinks in deep. In his good-bye message he says there is some One  coming after him, who will be to them as he had been, one of their own  kin, a deliverer, king, lawgiver, a wise, patient, tender judge and  teacher. The nation never forgot that word. When John the Baptist came,  they asked, \"Art thou _the_ prophet?\"    The second group of predictions is found during the nation's strength and  glory. To David comes the promise that the royal house he has founded is  to be _forever_,"]]]
