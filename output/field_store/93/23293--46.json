And thus it was not without some  plausibility that they endeavor to reconcile the fable to truth, who say  this was the drug in the tragedies with which Medea anointed the crown  and veils which she gave to Creon's daughter.\"    An interesting reference to the fire-worshipers of the Caucasus is  contained in the \"History of Zobeide,\" a tale of the wonderful Arabian  Nights Entertainment. It runs thus:    \"I bought a ship at Balsora, and freighted it; my sisters chose to go  with me, and we set sail with a fair wind. Some weeks after, we cast  anchor in a harbor which presented itself, with intent to water the  ship. As I was tired with having been so long on board, I landed with  the first boat, and walked up into the country. I soon came in sight of  a great town. When I arrived there, I was much surprised to see vast  numbers of people in different postures, but all immovable. The  merchants were in their shops, the soldiery on guard; every one seemed  engaged in his proper avocation, yet all were become as stone.... I  heard the voice of a man reading Al Koran.... Being curious to know why  he was the only living creature in the town,... he proceeded to tell  me that the city was the metropolis of a kingdom now governed by his  father; that the former king and all his subjects were Magi, worshipers  of fire and of Nardoun. the ancient king of the giants who rebelled  against God. 'Though I was born,' continued he, 'of idolatrous parents,  it was my good fortune to have a woman governess who was a strict  observer of the Mohammedan religion. She taught me Arabic from Al Koran;  by her I was instructed in the true religion, which I would never  afterward renounce. About three years ago a thundering voice was heard  distinctly throughout the city, saying, \"Inhabitants, abandon the  worship of Nardoun and of fire, and worship the only true God, who  showeth mercy!\" This voice was heard three years successively, but no  one regarded it. At the end of the last year all the inhabitants were in  an instant turned to stone. I alone was preserved.'\"    In the foregoing tale we doubtless have reference to the destruction  of Baku, on the Caspian (though to sail from Balsora to Baku is  impossible), and the driving away into India, by the Arabs under Caliph  Omar, of all who refused to renounce fire-worship and adopt the creed  of the Koran. The turning of the refractory inhabitants into stone is  probably the Arabian storyteller's figurative manner of referring to the  finding of dead bodies in a mummified condition.    It is known that the Egyptians made use of bitumen, in some form, in  the preservation of their dead, a fact with which the Arabians were  familiar. As the Magi held the four elements of earth, air, fire, and  water to be sacred, they feared to either bury, burn, sink, or expose  to air the corrupting bodies of their deceased. Therefore, it was their  practice to envelop the corpse in a coating of wax or bitumen, so as  to hermetically seal it from immediate contact with either of the four  sacred elements. Hence the idea of all the bodies of the Magi left at  Baku being turned to stone, while only the true believer in Mohammed  remained in the flesh.    Marco Polo, the famous traveler of the thirteenth century, makes  reference to the burning jets of the Caucasus, and those fires are known  to the Russians as continuing in existence since the army of Peter the  Great wrested the regions about the Caspian from the modern Persians.  The record of those flaming jets of natural gas is thus brought down in  an unbroken chain of evidence from remote antiquity to the present day,  and they are still burning.    Numerous Greek and Latin writers testify to the known existence of  petroleum about the shores of the Mediterranean two thousand years ago.  More modern citations may, however, be read with equal interest. In the  \"Journal of Sir Philip Skippon's Travels in France,\" in 1663, we find  the following curious entries:    \"We stayed in Grenoble till August 1st, and one day rode out, and, after  twice fording the river Drac (which makes a great wash) at a league's  distance, went over to Pont de Clef, a large arch across that river,  where we paid one sol a man; a league further we passed through a large  village called Vif, and about a league thence by S. Bathomew, another  village, and Chasteau Bernard, where we saw a flame breaking out of the  side of a bank, which is vulgarly called La Fountaine qui Brule; it  is by a small rivulet, and sometimes breaks out in other places; just  before our coming some other strangers had fried eggs here. The soil  hereabouts is full of a black stone, like our coal, which, perhaps, is  the continual fuel of the fire.... Near Peroul, about a league from  Montpelier, we saw a boiling fountain (as they call it), that is, the  water did heave up and bubble as if it boiled. This phenomenon in the  water was caused by a vapor ascending out of the earth through the  water, as was manifest, for if that one did but dig anywhere near the  place, and pour water upon the place new digged, one should observe in  it the like bubbling, the vapor arising not only in that place where the  fountain was, but all thereabout; the like vapor ascending out of the  earth and causing such ebullition in water it passes through hath been  observed in Mr. Hawkley's ground, about a mile from the town of Wigan,  in Lancashire, which vapor, by the application of a lighted candle,  paper; or the like, catches fire and flames vigorously. Whether or not  this vapor at Peroul would in like manner catch fire and burn I cannot  say, it coming not in our minds to make the experiment.... At Gabian,  about a day's journey from Montpelier, in the way to Beziers, is a  fountain of petroleum. It burns like oil, is of a pungent scent, and a  blackish color. It distills out of several places of the rock all the  year long, but most in the summer time. They gather it up with ladles  and put it in a barrel set on end, which hath a spigot just at the  bottom. When they have put in a good quantity, they open the spigot to  let out the water, and when the oil begins to come presently stop it.  They pay for the farm of this fountain about fifty crowns per annum.  We were told by one Monsieur Beaushoste, a chymist in Montpelier, that  petroleum was the very same with oil of jet, and not to be distinguished  from it by color, taste, smell, consistency, virtues, or any other  accident, as he had by experience found upon the coast of the  Mediterranean Sea, in several places, as at Berre, near Martague, in  Provence; at Messina, in Sicily, etc.\"    In Harris' \"Voyages,\" published in 1764, an article on the empire of  Persia thus refers to petroleum:    \"In several parts of Persia we meet with naphtha, both white and black;  it is used in painting and varnish, and sometimes in physic, and there  is an oil extracted from it which is applied to several uses. The most  famous springs of naphtha are in the neighborhood of Baku, which furnish  vast quantities, and there are also upward of thirty springs about  Shamasky, both in the province of Schirwan. The Persians use it as oil  for their lamps and in making fireworks, of which they are extremely  fond, and in which they are great proficients.\"    Petroleum has long been known to exist also in the northern part of  Italy, the cities of Parma and Genoa having been for many years lighted  with it.    In the province of Szechuen, China, natural gas is obtained from beds of  rock-salt at a depth of fifteen to sixteen hundred feet. Being brought  to the surface, it is conveyed in bamboo tubes and used for lighting as  well as for evaporating water in the manufacture of salt. It is asserted  that the Chinese used this natural gas for illuminating purposes  long before gas-lighting was known to the Europeans. Remembering the  unprogressive character of Chinese arts and industries, there is ground  for the belief that they may have been using this natural gas as an  illuminant these hundreds of years.    In the United States the existence of petroleum was known to the Pilgrim  Fathers, who doubtless obtained their first information of it from the  Indians, from whom, in New York and western Pennsylvania, it was called  Seneka oil. It was otherwise known as \"British\" oil and oil of naphtha,  and was considered \"a sovereign remedy for an inward bruise.\"    The record of natural gas in this country is not so complete as that of  petroleum, but we learn that an important gas spring was known in West  Bloomfleld, N.Y., seventy years ago. In 1864 a well was sunk to a depth  of three hundred feet upon that vein, from which a sufficient supply  of gas was obtained to illuminate and heat the city of Rochester  (twenty-five miles distant), it was supposed. But the pipes which were  laid for that purpose, being of wood, were unfitted to withstand the  pressure, in consequence of which the scheme was abandoned; but gas from  that well is now in use as an illuminant and as fuel both in the town of  West Bloomfield and at Honeoye Falls. The village of Fredonia, N.Y., has  been using natural gas in lighting the streets for thirty years or there  about. On Big Sewickley Creek, in Westmoreland County, Pa., natural gas  was used for evaporating water in the manufacture of salt thirty years  ago, and gas is still issuing at the same place. Natural gas has been in  use in several localities in eastern Ohio for twenty-five years, and the  wells are flowing as vigorously as when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#7)"],[1,"es--were in the habit of  boasting (what Women confessed and deplored) that they also had no  sides, being blessed with a perimeter of only one line, or, in other  words, a Circumference.  Hence it came to pass that these two Classes  could see no force in the so-called axiom about \"Distinction of Sides  implying Distinction of Colour;\" and when all others had succumbed to  the fascinations of corporal decoration, the Priests and the Women  alone still remained pure from the pollution of paint.    Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific--call them by what names  you will--yet, from an aesthetic point of view, those ancient days of  the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland--a  childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached the  blossom of youth.  To live then in itself a delight, because living  implied seeing.  Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to  behold; the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre  are said to have more than once proved too distracting from our  greatest teachers and actors; but most ravishing of all is said to have  been the unspeakable magnificence of a military review.    The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly  facing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the  orange of the two sides including their acute angle; the militia of the  Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white, and blue; the mauve,  ultra-marine, gamboge, and burnt umber of the Square artillerymen  rapidly rotating near their vermillion guns; the dashing and flashing  of the five-coloured and six-coloured Pentagons and Hexagons careering  across the field in their offices of surgeons, geometricians and  aides-de-camp--all these may well have been sufficient to render  credible the famous story how an illustrious Circle, overcome by the  artistic beauty of the forces under his command, threw aside his  marshal's baton and his royal crown, exclaiming that he henceforth  exchanged them for the artist's pencil.  How great and glorious the  sensuous development of these days must have been is in part indicated  by the very language and vocabulary of the period.  The commonest  utterances of the commonest citizens in the time of the Colour Revolt  seem to have been suffused with a richer tinge of word or thought; and  to that era we are even now indebted for our finest poetry and for  whatever rhythm still remains in the more scientific utterance of those  modern days.          SECTION 9  Of the Universal Colour Bill      But meanwhile the intellectual Arts were fast decaying.    The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer  practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other  kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into  disrespect and neglect even at our University.  The inferior Art of  Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools.  Then the Isosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer  used nor needed, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the  Criminal classes to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous  and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden  which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once  taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.    Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to  assert--and with increasing truth--that there was no great difference  between them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were  raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all  the difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical  or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.  Not content  with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they  began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all \"monopolizing and  aristocratic Arts\" and the consequent abolition of all endowments for  the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling.  Soon, they  began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had  destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow  in the same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes  should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.    Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders of the  Revolution advanced still further in their requirements, and at last  demanded that all classes alike, the Priests and the Women not  excepted, should do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted.  When  it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted that  Nature and Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half of  every human being (that is to say, the half containing his eye and  mouth) should be distinguishable from his hinder half.  They therefore  brought before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States  of Flatland a Bill proposing that in every Woman the half containing  the eye and mouth should be coloured red, and the other half green.  The Priests were to be painted in the same way, red being applied to  that semicircle in which the eye and mouth formed the middle point;  while the other or hinder semicircle was to be coloured green.    There was no little cunning in this proposal, which indeed emanated not  from any Isosceles--for no being so degraded would have angularity  enough to appreciate, much less to devise, such a model of  state-craft--but from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being  destroyed in his childhood, was reserved by a foolish indulgence to  bring desolation on his country and destruction on myriads of followers.    On the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women in  all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation.  For by  assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned to the  Priests, the Revolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain positions,  every Woman would appear as a Priest, and be treated with corresponding  respect and deference--a prospect that could not fail to attract the  Female Sex in a mass.    But by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance  of Priests and Women, under a new Legislation, may not be recognized;  if so, a word or two will make it obvious.    Imagine a woman duly decorated, according to the new Code; with the  front half (i.e., the half containing the eye and mouth) red, and with  the hinder half green.  Look at her from one side.  Obviously you will  see a straight line, HALF RED, HALF GREEN.    Now imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front semicircle  (AMB) is consequently coloured red, while his hinder semicircle is  green; so that the diameter AB divides the green from the red.  If you  contemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye in the same straight  line as his dividing diameter (AB), what you will see will be a  straight line (CBD), of which ONE HALF (CB) WILL BE RED, AND THE OTHER  (BD) GREEN.  The whole line (CD) will be rather shorter perhaps than  that of a full-sized Woman, and will shade off more rapidly towards its  extremities; but the identity of the colours would give you an  immediate impression of identity in Class, making you neglectful of  other details.  Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which  threatened society at the time of the Colour revolt; add too the  certainty that Woman would speedily learn to shade off their  extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely  obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a  great danger of confounding a Priest with a young Woman.    How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may  readily be imagined.  They anticipated with delight the confusion that  would ensue.  At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical  secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and  might even issue some commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out of  doors the striking combination of red and green without addition of any  other colours, would be sure to lead the common people into endless  mistakes, and the Woman would gain whatever the Circles lost, in the  deference of the passers by.  As for the scandal that would befall the  Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were  imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the  Constitution, the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought to  these considerations.  Even in the households of the Circles, the Women  were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill.    The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization  of the Circles themselves.  In the general intellectual decay they  still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding.  From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular  households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved  the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that  result from that admirable training of the intellect.  Hence, up to the  date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had  not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other  classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.    Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real  author of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow to lower the  status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of  Colour, and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of  training in the Art of Sight Recognition, so as to enfeeble their  intellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes.  Once  subjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and every childish  Circle would demoralize each other.  Only in discerning between the"]]]
