If sweet sleep chain me, here thou walk'st at large;      If sweet sleep loose me, straightway thou art gone,      Scared like a sheep that sees the grey wolf near.      I loved thee, maiden, when thou cam'st long since,      To pluck the hyacinth-blossom on the fell,      Thou and my mother, piloted by me.      I saw thee, see thee still, from that day forth      For ever; but 'tis naught, ay naught, to thee.      I know, sweet maiden, why thou art so coy:      Shaggy and huge, a single eyebrow spans      From ear to ear my forehead, whence one eye      Gleams, and an o'erbroad nostril tops my lip.      Yet I, this monster, feed a thousand sheep      That yield me sweetest draughts at milking-tide:      In summer, autumn, or midwinter, still      Fails not my cheese; my milkpail aye o'erflows.      Then I can pipe as ne'er did Giant yet,      Singing our loves--ours, honey, thine and mine--      At dead of night: and hinds I rear eleven      (Each with her fawn) and bearcubs four, for thee.      Oh come to me--thou shalt not rue the day--      And let the mad seas beat against the shore!      'Twere sweet to haunt my cave the livelong night:      Laurel, and cypress tall, and ivy dun,      And vines of sumptuous fruitage, all are there:      And a cold spring that pine-clad AEtna flings      Down from, the white snow's midst, a draught for gods!      Who would not change for this the ocean-waves?          \"But thou mislik'st my hair? Well, oaken logs      Are here, and embers yet aglow with fire.      Burn (if thou wilt) my heart out, and mine eye,      Mine only eye wherein is my delight.      Oh why was I not born a finny thing,      To float unto thy side and kiss thy hand,      Denied thy lips--and bring thee lilies white      And crimson-petalled poppies' dainty bloom!      Nay--summer hath his flowers and autumn his;      I could not bring all these the selfsame day.      Lo, should some mariner hither oar his road,      Sweet, he shall teach me straightway how to swim,      That haply I may learn what bliss ye find      In your sea-homes. O Galatea, come      Forth from yon waves, and coming forth forget      (As I do, sitting here) to get thee home:      And feed my flocks and milk them, nothing loth,      And pour the rennet in to fix my cheese!          \"The blame's my mother's; she is false to me;      Spake thee ne'er yet one sweet word for my sake,      Though day by day she sees me pine and pine.      I'll feign strange throbbings in my head and feet      To anguish her--as I am anguished now.\"          O Cyclops, Cyclops, where are flown thy wits?      Go plait rush-baskets, lop the olive-boughs      To feed thy lambkins--'twere the shrewder part.      Chase not the recreant, milk the willing ewe:      The world hath Galateas fairer yet.          \"--Many a fair damsel bids me sport with her      The livelong night, and smiles if I give ear.      On land at least I still am somebody.\"          Thus did the Giant feed his love on song,      And gained more ease than may be bought with gold.          IDYLL XII.    The Comrades        Thou art come, lad, come! Scarce thrice hath dusk to day      Given place--but lovers in an hour grow gray.      As spring's more sweet than winter, grapes than thorns,      The ewe's fleece richer than her latest-born's;      As young girls' charms the thrice-wed wife's outshine,      As fawns are lither than the ungainly kine,      Or as the nightingale's clear notes outvie      The mingled music of all birds that fly;      So at thy coming passing glad was I.      I ran to greet thee e'en as pilgrims run      To beechen shadows from the scorching sun:      Oh if on us accordant Loves would breathe,      And our two names to future years bequeath!          'These twain'--let men say--'lived in olden days.      This was a _yokel_ (in their country-phrase),      That was his _mate_ (so talked these simple folk):      And lovingly they bore a mutual yoke.      The hearts of men were made of sterling gold,      When troth met troth, in those brave days of old,'          O Zeus, O gods who age not nor decay!      Let e'en two hundred ages roll away,      But at the last these tidings let me learn,      Borne o'er the fatal pool whence none return:--      \"By every tongue thy constancy is sung,      Thine and thy favourite's--chiefly by the young.\"      But lo, the future is in heaven's high hand:      Meanwhile thy graces all my praise demand,      Not false lip-praise, not idly bubbling froth--      For though thy wrath be kindled, e'en thy wrath      Hath no sting in it: doubly I am caressed,      And go my way repaid with interest.          Oarsmen of Megara, ruled by Nisus erst!      Yours be all bliss, because ye honoured first      That true child-lover, Attic Diocles.      Around his gravestone with the first spring-breeze      Flock the bairns all, to win the kissing-prize:      And whoso sweetliest lip to lip applies      Goes crown-clad home to its mother. Blest is he      Who in such strife is named the referee:      To brightfaced Ganymede full oft he'll cry      To lend his lip the potencies that lie      Within that stone with which the usurers      Detect base metal, and which never errs.          IDYLL XIII.      Hylas.        Not for us only, Nicias, (vain the dream,)        Sprung from what god soe'er, was Eros born:      Not to us only grace doth graceful seem,        Frail things who wot not of the coming morn.      No--for Amphitryon's iron-hearted son,      Who braved the lion, was the slave of one:--        A fair curled creature, Hylas was his name.        He taught him, as a father might his child,      All songs whereby himself had risen to fame;        Nor ever from his side would be beguiled      When noon was high, nor when white steeds convey      Back to heaven's gates the chariot of the day,        Nor when the hen's shrill brood becomes aware        Of bed-time, as the mother's flapping wings      Shadow the dust-browned beam. 'Twas all his care        To shape unto his own imaginings      And to the harness train his favourite youth,      Till he became a man in very truth.        Meanwhile, when kingly Jason steered in quest        Of the Gold Fleece, and chieftains at his side      Chosen from all cities, proffering each her best,        To rich Iolchos came that warrior tried,      And joined him unto trim-built Argo's crew;      And with Alcmena's son came Hylas too.        Through the great gulf shot Argo like a bird--        And by-and-bye reached Phasis, ne'er o'erta'en      By those in-rushing rocks, that have not stirred        Since then, but bask, twin monsters, on the main.      But now, when waned the spring, and lambs were fed      In far-off fields, and Pleiads gleamed overhead,        That cream and flower of knighthood looked to sail.        They came, within broad Argo safely stowed,      (When for three days had blown the southern gale)        To Hellespont, and in Propontis rode      At anchor, where Cianian oxen now      Broaden the furrows with the busy plough.        They leapt ashore, and, keeping rank, prepared        Their evening meal: a grassy meadow spread      Before their eyes, and many a warrior shared        (Thanks to its verdurous stores) one lowly bed.      And while they cut tall marigolds from their stem      And sworded bulrush, Hylas slipt from them.        Water the fair lad wont to seek and bring        To Heracles and stalwart Telamon,      (The comrades aye partook each other's fare,)        Bearing a brazen pitcher. And anon,      Where the ground dipt, a fountain he espied,      And rushes growing green about its side.        There rose the sea-blue swallow-wort, and there        The pale-hued maidenhair, with parsley green      And vagrant marsh-flowers; and a revel rare        In the pool's midst the water-nymphs were seen      To hold, those maidens of unslumbrous eyes      Whom the belated peasant sees and flies.        And fast did Malis and Eunica cling,        And young Nychea with her April face,      To the lad's hand, as stooping o'er the spring        He dipt his pitcher. For the young Greek's grace      Made their soft senses reel; and down he fell,      All of a sudden, into that black well.        So drops a red star suddenly from sky        To sea--and quoth some sailor to his mate:      \"Up with the tackle, boy! the breeze is high.\"        Him the nymphs pillowed, all disconsolate,      On their sweet laps, and with soft words beguiled;      But Heracles was troubled for the child.        Forth went he; Scythian-wise his bow he bore        And the great club that never quits his side;      And thrice called 'Hylas'--ne'er came lustier roar        From that deep chest. Thrice Hylas heard and tried      To answer, but in tones you scarce might hear;      The water made them distant though so near.        And as a lion, when he hears the bleat        Of fawns among the mountains far away,      A murderous lion, and with hurrying feet        Bounds from his lair to his predestined prey:      So plunged the strong man in the untrodden brake--      (Lovers are maniacs)--for his darling's sake.        He scoured far fields--what hill or oaken glen        Remembers not that pilgrimage of pain?      His troth to Jason was forgotten then.        Long time the good ship tarried for those twain      With hoisted sails; night came and still they cleared      The hatches, but no Heracles appeared.        On he was wandering, reckless where he trod,        So mad a passion on his vitals preyed:      While Hylas had become a blessed god.        But the crew cursed the runaway who had stayed      Sixty good oars, and left him there to reach      Afoot bleak Phasis and the Colchian beach.          IDYLL XIV.

The moment the cabriolet stopped,  the man behind jumped down, took my brother in his arms, as if he had been  a child, and carried him into the house. It was Jaquemart. 'The monsters,'  said he, 'the monsters! the poor young man, they have killed him too.'

I happened to be  near his majesty when he addressed himself to an Englishman, wearing the  Cross of Three Days. \"Where did you signalize yourself, sir?\" inquired the  monarch. \"At the Tuilleries, sire,\" was the answer. \"_C'est aux braves de  Juillet que je dois ma couronne_,\" said his majesty. The gentleman thus  honoured was M. Bennis,[1] in whose literary establishment the king seems  to take much interest.           *       *       *       *       *      GUTTING THE FISH.      One evening a red-headed Connaught swell, of no small aristocratic  pretensions in his own eyes, sent his servant, whom he had just imported  from the long-horned kingdom, in all the rough majesty of a creature fresh  from the \"wilds,\" to purchase a hundred of oysters on the City-quay. Paddy  staid so long away, that Squire Trigger got quite impatient and unhappy  lest his \"body man\" might have slipt into the Liffey; however, to his  infinite relief, Paddy soon made his appearance, puffing and blowing like  a disabled bellows, but carrying his load seemingly in great triumph.  \"Well, Pat,\" cried the master, \"what the devil kept you so long?\" \"Long! a  thin, may be it's what you'd have me to come home with half my _arrant?_\"  says Pat. \"Half the oysters?\" says the master. \"No; but too much of the  _fish_.\" says Pat. \"What fish?\" says he. \"The oysters, to be sure,\" says  Pat. \"What do you mean, blockhead?\" says he. \"I mean,\" says Pat, \"that  there was no use with loading myself with more nor was useful.\"  \"Will you explain yourself?\" says he. \"I will,\" says Pat laying down his  load. \"Well then, you see, plaise your Honour, as I was coming home along  the quay, mighty peaceable, who should I meet but Shammus Maginnis; 'Good  morrow, Shamien,' sis I; 'Good morrow kindly, Paudeen,' sis he; 'What is  it you have in the sack?' sis he; 'A _Cwt_. of oysters,' sis I; 'Let us  look at them,' says he; 'I will, and welcome,' sis I; 'Orah! thunder and  pratees!' sis he, openin the sack an examinin them; 'who _sowld_ you  these?'
