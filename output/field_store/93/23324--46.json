As it was inconvenient, when Rome had become a very great city, to  convene the comitia for the trial of offenders, the expedient was  adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the people to persons invested  with temporary authority, called _quaestors_. These were finally  established into regular and permanent courts, called _quaestores  perpetui_. Every case submitted to these courts was tried by a judge and  jury. It was the duty of the judge to preside and regulate proceedings  according to law; and it was the duty of the jury, after hearing the  evidence and pleadings, to decide on the guilt or innocence of the  accused. As many as fifty persons frequently composed the jury, whose  names were drawn out of an urn. Each party had a right to challenge a  certain number, and the verdict was decided by a majority of votes. At  first the judices were chosen from the senate, and afterward from the  equestrians, and then again from both orders. But in process of time the  quaestores perpetui gave place to imperial magistrates. The accused  defended himself in person or by counsel.    The Romans divided _crimes_ into public and private. Private crimes  could be prosecuted only by the party injured, and were generally  punished by pecuniary fines, as among the old Germanic nations.    Of public crimes the _crimen laesae majestatis_, or treason, was  regarded as the greatest; and this was punished with death and with  confiscation of goods, while the memory of the offender was declared  infamous. Greater severity could scarcely be visited on a culprit.  Treason comprehended conspiracy against the government, assisting the  enemies of Rome, and misconduct in the command of armies. Thus Manlius,  in spite of his magnificent services, was hurled from the Tarpeian  Rock, because he was convicted of an intention to seize upon the  government. Under the empire not only any attempt on the life of the  Emperor was treason, but disrespectful words or acts. The criminal was  even tried after death, that his memory might become infamous; and this  barbarous practice was perpetuated in France and Scotland as late as the  beginning of the seventeenth century. In England men have been executed  for treasonable words. Besides treason there were other crimes against  the State, such as a breach of the peace, extortion on the part of  provincial governors, embezzlement of public property, stealing sacred  things, bribery,--most of which offences were punished by pecuniary  penalties.    But there were also crimes against individuals, which were punished with  the death penalty. Wilful murder, poisoning, and parricide were  capitally punished. Adultery was punished by banishment, besides a  forfeiture of considerable property; Constantine made it a capital  offence. Rape was punished with death and confiscation of goods, as in  England till a late period, when transportation for life became the  penalty. The punishments inflicted for forgery, coining base money, and  perjury were arbitrary. Robbery, theft, patrimonial damage, and injury  to person and property were private trespasses, and not punished by the  State. After a lapse of twenty years without accusation, crimes were  supposed to be extinguished. The Cornelian, Pompeian, and Julian laws  formed the foundation of criminal jurisprudence. This however never  attained the perfection that was seen in the Civil Code, in which the  full maturity of Roman wisdom was reached. The emperors greatly  increased the severity of punishments, as was probably necessary in a  corrupt state of society. After the decemviral laws fell into disuse,  the Romans in the days of the republic passed from extreme rigor to  great lenity, as is observable in the transition from the Puritan regime  to our own times in the United States. Capital punishment for several  centuries was exceedingly rare, and was frequently prevented by  voluntary exile. Under the empire, again, public executions were  frequent and revolting.    Fines were a common mode of punishment with the Romans, as with the  early Germans. Imprisonment in a public jail was rare, the custom of  bail being in general use. Although retaliation was authorized by the  Twelve Tables for bodily injuries, it was seldom exacted, since  pecuniary compensation was taken in lieu. Corporal punishments were  inflicted upon slaves, but rarely upon citizens, except for military  crimes; but Roman citizens could be sold into slavery for various  offences, chiefly military, and criminals were often condemned to labor  in the mines or upon public works. Banishment was common,--_aquae et  ignis interdictio_; and this was equivalent to the deprivation of the  necessities of life and incapacitating a person from exercising the  rights of citizenship. Under the emperors persons were confined often on  the rocky islands off the coast, or in a compulsory residence in a  particular place assigned. Thus Chrysostom was sent to a dreary place on  the banks of the Euxine, and Ovid was banished to Tomi. Death, when  inflicted, was by hanging, scourging, and beheading; also by strangling  in prison. Slaves were often crucified, and were compelled to carry  their cross to the place of execution. This was the most ignominious and  lingering of all deaths; it was abolished by Constantine, from reverence  to the sacred symbol. Under the emperors, execution took place also by  burning alive and exposure to wild beasts; it was thus the early  Christians were tormented, since their offence was associated with  treason. Persons of distinction were treated with more favor than the  lower classes, and their punishments were less cruel and ignominious;  thus Seneca, condemned for privity to treason, was allowed to choose his  mode of death. The criminal laws of modern European States followed too  often the barbarous custom of the Roman emperors until a recent date.  Since the French Revolution the severity of the penal codes has been  much modified.    The penal statutes of Rome however, as Gibbon emphatically remarks,  \"formed a very small portion of the Code and the Pandects; and in all  judicial proceedings the life or death of the citizen was determined  with less caution and delay than the most ordinary question of covenant  or inheritance.\" This was owing to the complicated relations of society,  by which obligations are created or annulled, while duties to the State  are explicit and well known, being inscribed not only on tables of  brass, but on the conscience itself. It was natural, with the growth and  development of commerce and dominion, that questions should arise which  could not be ordinarily settled by ancient customs, and the practice of  lawyers and the decisions of judges continually raised new difficulties,  to be met only by new edicts. It is a pleasing fact to record, that  jurisprudence became more just and enlightened as it became more  intricate. The principles of equity were more regarded under the  emperors than in the time of Cato. It is in the application of these  principles that the laws of the Romans have obtained so high  consideration; their abuse consisted in the expense of litigation, and  the advantages which the rich thus obtained over the poor.    But if delays and forms led to an expensive and vexatious administration  of justice, these were more than compensated by the checks which a  complicated jurisprudence gave to hasty or partial decisions. It was in  the minuteness and precision of the forms of law, and in the foresight  with which questions were anticipated in the various transactions of  business, that the Romans in their civil and social relations were very  much on a level with modern times. It would be difficult to find in the  most enlightened of modern codes greater wisdom and foresight than  appear in the legacy of Justinian as to all questions pertaining to the  nature, the acquisition, the possession, the use, and the transfer of  property. Civil obligations are most admirably defined, and all  contracts are determined by the wisest application of the natural  principles of justice. Nothing can be more enlightened than the laws  which relate to leases, to sales, to partnerships, to damages, to  pledges, to hiring of work, and to quasi-contracts. The laws pertaining  to the succession to property, to the duties of guardians, to the rights  of wards, to legacies, to bequests in trust, and to the general  limitation of testamentary powers were singularly clear. The regulations  in reference to intestate succession, and to the division of property  among males and females, were wise and just; we find no laws of entail,  no unequal rights, no absurd distinction between brothers, no peculiar  privileges given to males over females, or to older sons. Particularly  was everything pertaining to property and contracts and wills guarded  with the most jealous care. A man was sure of possessing his own, and of  transmitting it to his children. In the Institutes of Justinian we see  on every page a regard to the principles of natural justice: but  moreover we find that malicious witnesses should be punished; that  corrupt judges should be visited with severe penalties; that libels and  satires should subject their authors to severe chastisement; that every  culprit should be considered innocent until his guilt was proved.    No infringement on personal rights could be tolerated. A citizen was  free to go where he pleased, to do whatsoever he would, if he did not  trespass on the rights of another; to seek his pleasure unobstructed,  and pursue his business without vexatious incumbrances. If he was  injured or cheated, he was sure of redress; nor could he be easily  defrauded with the sanction of the laws. A rigorous police guarded his  person, his house, and his property; he was supreme and uncontrolled  within his family.

That is my home! If I go forth, a host  Of feasts and bridal dances, gatherings gay  Of women, will be there to fright me away  To loneliness. Mine eyes will never bear  The sight. They were her friends; they played with her.    And always, always, men who hate my name  Will murmur: \"This is he who lives in shame  Because he dared not die! He gave instead  The woman whom he loved, and so is fled  From death. He counts himself a man withal!  And seeing his parents died not at his call  He hates them, when himself he dared not die!\"    Such mocking beside all my pain shall I  Endure.... What profit was it to live on,  Friend, with my grief kept and mine honour gone?    CHORUS.  I have sojourned in the Muse's land,    Have wandered with the wandering star,  Seeking for strength, and in my hand    Held all philosophies that are;  Yet nothing could I hear nor see  Stronger than That Which Needs Must Be.  No Orphic rune, no Thracian scroll,    Hath magic to avert the morrow;  No healing all those medicines brave  Apollo to the Asclepiad gave;  Pale herbs of comfort in the bowl      Of man's wide sorrow.  She hath no temple, she alone,    Nor image where a man may kneel;  No blood upon her altar-stone    Crying shall make her hear nor feel.  I know thy greatness; come not great  Beyond my dreams, O Power of Fate!  Aye, Zeus himself shall not unclose    His purpose save by thy decerning.  The chain of iron, the Scythian sword,  It yields and shivers at thy word;  Thy heart is as the rock, and knows    No ruth, nor turning.    [_They turn to_ ADMETUS.]    Her hand hath caught thee; yea, the keeping    Of iron fingers grips thee round.  Be still. Be still. Thy noise of weeping    Shall raise no lost one from the ground.  Nay, even the Sons of God are parted  At last from joy, and pine in death....  Oh, dear on earth when all did love her,  Oh, dearer lost beyond recover:  Of women all the bravest-hearted    Hath pressed thy lips and breathed thy breath.    Let not the earth that lies upon her    Be deemed a grave-mound of the dead.  Let honour, as the Gods have honour,    Be hers, till men shall bow the head,  And strangers, climbing from the city    Her slanting path, shall muse and say:  \"This woman died to save her lover,  And liveth blest, the stars above her:  Hail, Holy One, and grant thy pity!\"    So pass the wondering words away.    LEADER.  But see, it is Alcmena's son once more,  My lord King, cometh striding to thy door.    [_Enter_ HERACLES; _his dress is as in the last scene, but shows  signs of a struggle. Behind come two Attendants, guiding between them a  veiled Woman, who seems like one asleep or unconscious. The Woman remains  in the background while_ HERACLES _comes forward._]    HERACLES.  Thou art my friend, Admetus; therefore bold  And plain I tell my story, and withhold  No secret hurt.--Was I not worthy, friend,  To stand beside thee; yea, and to the end  Be proven in sorrow if I was true to thee?  And thou didst tell me not a word, while she  Lay dead within; but bid me feast, as though  Naught but the draping of some stranger's woe  Was on thee. So I garlanded my brow  And poured the gods drink-offering, and but now  Filled thy death-stricken house with wine and song.  Thou hast done me wrong, my brother; a great wrong  Thou hast done me. But I will not add more pain  In thine affliction.                        Why I am here again,  Returning, thou must hear. I pray thee, take  And keep yon woman for me till I make  My homeward way from Thrace, when I have ta'en  Those four steeds and their bloody master slain.  And if--which heaven avert!--I ne'er should see  Hellas again, I leave her here, to be  An handmaid in thy house. No labour small  Was it that brought her to my hand at all.  I fell upon a contest certain Kings  Had set for all mankind, sore buffetings  And meet for strong men, where I staked my life  And won this woman. For the easier strife  Black steeds were prizes; herds of kine were cast  For heavier issues, fists and wrestling; last,  This woman.... Lest my work should all seem done  For naught, I needs must keep what I have won;  So prithee take her in. No theft, but true  Toil, won her.... Some day thou mayst thank me, too.    ADMETUS.  'Twas in no scorn, no bitterness to thee,  I hid my wife's death and my misery.  Methought it was but added pain on pain  If thou shouldst leave me, and roam forth again  Seeking another's roof. And, for mine own  Sorrow, I was content to weep alone.    But, for this damsel, if it may be so,  I pray thee, Lord, let some man, not in woe  Like mine, take her. Thou hast in Thessaly  Abundant friends.... 'Twould wake sad thoughts in me.    How could I have this damsel in my sight  And keep mine eyes dry? Prince, why wilt thou smite  The smitten? Griefs enough are on my head.    Where in my castle could so young a maid  Be lodged--her veil and raiment show her young:  Here, in the men's hall? I should fear some wrong.  'Tis not so easy, Prince, to keep controlled  My young men. And thy charge I fain would hold  Sacred.--If not, wouldst have me keep her in  The women's chambers ... where my dead hath been?  How could I lay this woman where my bride  Once lay? It were dishonour double-dyed.  These streets would curse the man who so betrayed  The wife who saved him for some younger maid;  The dead herself ... I needs must worship her  And keep her will.    [_During the last few lines_ ADMETUS _has been looking at the  veiled Woman and, though he does not consciously recognize her,  feels a strange emotion overmastering him. He draws back._]                          Aye. I must walk with care....  O woman, whosoe'er thou art, thou hast  The shape of my Alcestis; thou art cast  In mould like hers.... Oh, take her from mine eyes!  In God's name!    [HERACLES _signs to the Attendants to take_ ALCESTIS _away again.  She stays veiled and unnoticing in the background._]    I was fallen, and in this wise  Thou wilt make me deeper fall.... Meseems, meseems,  There in her face the loved one of my dreams  Looked forth.--My heart is made a turbid thing,  Craving I know not what, and my tears spring  Unbidden.--Grief I knew 'twould be; but how  Fiery a grief I never knew till now.    LEADER.  Thy fate I praise not. Yet, what gift soe'er  God giveth, man must steel himself and bear.    HERACLES (_drawing_ ADMETUS _on_).  Would God, I had the power, 'mid all this might  Of arm, to break the dungeons of the night,  And free thy wife, and make thee glad again!    ADMETUS.  Where is such power? I know thy heart were fain;  But so 'tis writ. The dead shall never rise.    HERACLES.  Chafe not the curb, then: suffer and be wise.    ADMETUS.  Easier to give such counsel than to keep.    HERACLES.  Who will be happier, shouldst thou always weep?    ADMETUS.  Why, none. Yet some blind longing draws me on...    HERACLES.  'Tis natural. Thou didst love her that is gone.    ADMETUS.  'Tis that hath wrecked, oh more than wrecked, my life.    HERACLES.  'Tis certain: thou hast lost a faithful wife.    ADMETUS.  Till life itself is dead and wearies me.    HERACLES.  Thy pain is yet young. Time will soften thee,    [_The veiled Woman begins dimly, as though in a dream, to hear the words  spoken._]    ADMETUS.  Time? Yes, if time be death.    HERACLES.                                Nay, wait; and some  Woman, some new desire of love, will come.    ADMETUS (_indignantly_).  Peace!  How canst thou? Shame upon thee!    HERACLES.                                    Thou wilt stay  Unwed for ever, lonely night and day?    ADMETUS.  No other bride in these void arms shall lie.    HERACLES.  What profit will thy dead wife gain thereby?    ADMETUS.  Honour; which finds her wheresoe'er she lies.    HERACLES.  Most honourable in thee: but scarcely wise!    ADMETUS.  God curse me, if I betray her in her tomb!    HERACLES.  So be it!...  And this good damsel, thou wilt take her home?    ADMETUS.  No, in the name of Zeus, thy father! No!    HERACLES.  I swear, 'tis not well to reject her so.    ADMETUS.  'Twould tear my heart to accept her.    HERACLES.                                        Grant me, friend,  This one boon! It may help thee in the end.    ADMETUS.  Woe's me!  Would God thou hadst never won those victories!    HERACLES.  Thou sharest both the victory and the prize.    ADMETUS.  Thou art generous.... But now let her go.    HERACLES.                                             She shall,  If go she must. Look first, and judge withal.    [_He takes the veil off_ ALCESTIS.]    ADMETUS (_steadily refusing to look_).  She must.--And thou, forgive me!    HERACLES.                                    Friend, there is  A secret reason why I pray for this.    ADMETUS (_surprised, then reluctantly yielding_).  I grant thy boon then--though it likes me ill.    HERACLES.  'Twill like thee later. Now ... but do my will.    ADMETUS (_beckoning to an Attendant_).  Take her; find her some lodging in my hall.    HERACLES.  I will not yield this maid to any thrall.    ADMETUS.  Take her thyself and lead her in.    HERACLES.                                     I stand  Beside her; take her; lead her to thy hand.    [_He brings the Woman close to_ ADMETUS, _who looks determinedly  away. She reaches out her arms._]    ADMETUS.  I touch her not.--Let her go in!    HERACLES.                                    I am loth  To trust her save to thy pledged hand and oath.    [_He lays his hand on_ ADMETUS'S _shoulder_.]    ADMETUS (_desperately_).  Lord, this is violence ... wrong ...    HERACLES.                                       Reach forth thine hand  And touch this comer from a distant land.    ADMETUS (_holding out his hand without looking_).  Like Perseus"]]]
