In the judicial department, in England at least, one important  class of courts, the popular county courts, was never seriously affected  by feudalism, either in their organization or in the law which they  interpreted. Any complete description of the feudal organization must be  understood to be a description of tendencies rather than of a realized  system. It was the tendency of feudalism to transform the state into a  series of principalities rising in tiers one above the other, and to get  the business of the state done, not through a central constitutional  machine, but through a series of graded duties corresponding to these  successive stages and secured by private agreements between the  landholders and by a customary law which was the outgrowth of such  agreements.    At the date of the Norman Conquest of England, this tendency was more  nearly realized in France than anywhere else. Within the limits of that  state a number of great feudal principalities had been formed, duchies  and counties, round the administrative divisions of an earlier time as  their starting-point, in many of which the sovereign of the state could  exercise no powers of government. The extensive powers which the earlier  system had intrusted to the duke or count as an administrative officer of  the state he now exercised as a practically independent sovereign, and  the state could expect from this portion of its territory only the feudal  services of its ruler, perhaps ill-defined and difficult to enforce. In  some cases, however, this process of breaking up the state into smaller  units went no further. Normandy, with which we are particularly  concerned, was an instance of this fact. The duke was practically the  sole sovereign of that province. The king of France was entirely shut  out. Even the Church was under the unlimited control of the duke. And  with respect to his subjects his power was as great as with respect to  his nominal sovereign. Very few great baronies existed in Normandy formed  of contiguous territory and capable of development into independent  principalities, and those that did exist were kept constantly in the  hands of relatives of the ducal house and under strong control. Political  feudalism existed in Normandy in even greater perfection and in a more  logical completeness, if we regard the forms alone, its practices and  customs, than was usual in the feudal world of that age; but it existed  not as the means by which the state was broken into fragments, but as the  machinery by which it was governed by the duke. It formed the bond of  connexion between him and the great men of the state. It defined the  services which he had the right to demand of them, and which they in turn  might demand of their vassals. It formed the foundation of the army and  of the judicial system. Every department of the state was influenced by  its forms and principles. At the same time the Duke of Normandy was more  than a feudal suzerain. He had saved on the whole, from the feudal  deluge, more of the prerogatives of sovereignty than had the king of  France. He had a considerable non-feudal administrative system, though it  might not reach all parts of the duchy. The supreme judicial power had  never been parted with, and the Norman barons were unable to exercise in  its full extent the right of high justice. The oath of allegiance from  all freemen, whosesoever vassals they might be, traces of which are to be  found in many feudal lands and even under the Capetian kings, was  retained in the duchy. Private war, baronial coinage, engagements with  foreign princes to the injury of the duke,--these might occur in  exceptional cases during a minority or under a weak duke, or in time of  rebellion; but the strong dukes repressed them with an iron hand, and no  Norman baron could claim any of them as a prescriptive right. Feudalism  existed in Normandy as the organization of the state, and as the system  which regulated the relations between the duke and the knights and the  nobles of the land, but it did not exist at the expense of the sovereign  rights of the duke.    This was the system which was introduced fully formed into England with  the grants of land which the Conqueror made to his barons. It was the  only system known to him by which to regulate their relations to himself  and their duties to the state. To suppose a gradual introduction of  feudalism into England, except in a geographical sense, as the  confiscation spread over the land, is to misunderstand both feudalism  itself and its history. This system gave to the baron opportunities which  might be dangerous under a ruler who could not make himself obeyed, but  there was nothing in it inconsistent with the practical absolutism  exercised by the first of the Norman kings and by the more part of his  immediate successors. Feudalism brought in with itself two ideas which  exercised decisive influence on later English history. I do not mean to  assert that these ideas were consciously held, or that they could have  been formulated in words, though of the first at least this was very  nearly true, but that they unconsciously controlled the facts of the time  and their future development. One was the idea that all holders of land  in the kingdom, except the king, were, strictly speaking, tenants rather  than owners, which profoundly influenced the history of English law; the  other was the idea that important public duties were really private  obligations, created by a business contract, which as profoundly  influenced the growth of the constitution. Taken together, the  introduction of the feudal system was as momentous a change as any which  followed the Norman Conquest, as decisive in its influence upon the  future as the enrichment of race or of language; more decisive in one  respect, since without the consequences in government and constitution,  which were destined to follow from the feudalization of the English  state, neither race nor language could have done the work in the world  which they have already accomplished and are yet destined to perform in  still larger measure.    But, however profound this change may have been, it affected but a small  class, comparatively speaking. The whole number of military units, of  knights due the king in service, seems to have been something less than  five thousand.[3] For the great mass of the population, the working  substratum, whose labours sustained the life of the nation, the Norman  Conquest made but little change. The interior organization of the manor  was not affected by it. Its work went on in the same way as before.  There was a change of masters; there was a new set of ideas to interpret  the old relationship; the upper grades of the manorial population  suffered in some parts of England a serious depression. But in the main,  as concerned the great mass of facts, there was no change of importance.  Nor was there any, at first at least, which affected the position of the  towns. The new system allowed as readily as the old the rights which  they already possessed. In the end, the new ideas might be a serious  matter for the towns in some particulars, but at present the conditions  did not exist which were to raise these difficulties. At the time, to  the mass of the nation, to everybody indeed, the Norman Conquest might  easily seem but a change of sovereigns, a change of masters. It is  because we can see the results of the changes which it really introduced  that we are able to estimate their profound significance.    The spoiling of England for the benefit of the foreigner did not consist  in the confiscation of lands alone. Besides the forced redemption of  their lands, William seems to have laid a heavy tax on the nation, and  the churches and monasteries whose lands were free from confiscation seem  to have suffered heavy losses of their gold and silver and precious  stuffs. The royal treasure and Harold's possessions would pass into  William's hands, and much confiscated and plundered wealth besides. These  things he distributed with a free hand, especially to the churches of the  continent whose prayers and blessings he unquestionably regarded as a  strong reinforcement of his arms. Harold's rich banner of the fighting  man went to Rome, and valuable gifts besides, and the Norman  ecclesiastical world had abundant cause to return thanks to heaven for  the successes which had attended the efforts of the Norman military arm.  If William despatched these gifts to the continent before his own return  to Normandy, they did not exhaust his booty, for the wonder and  admiration of the duchy is plainly expressed at the richness and beauty  of the spoils which he brought home with him.    Having settled the matters which demanded immediate attention, the king  proceeded to make a progress through those parts of his kingdom which  were under his control. Just where he went we are not told, but he can  hardly have gone far outside the counties of southern and eastern England  which were directly influenced by his march on London. In such a progress  he probably had chiefly in mind to take possession for himself and his  men of confiscated estates and of strategic points. No opposition showed  itself anywhere, but women with their children appeared along the way to  beseech his mercy, and the favour which he showed to these suppliants was  thought worthy of special remark. Winchester seems to have been visited,  and secured by the beginning of a Norman castle within the walls, and the  journey ended at Pevensey, where he had landed so short a time before in  pursuit of the crown. William had decided that he could return to  Normandy, and the decision that this could be safely done with so small a  part of the kingdom actually in hand, with so few castles already built  or garrisons established, is the clearest possible evidence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#7)"],[1,"to get out of  order. The action is as follows: The attendant lifts the hank out of the  vat and places it on the hooks. The hook connected to the gearing then  commences to turn; it puts in two, two and a half, three, or more twists  into the hank and remains stationary for a few seconds to allow an  interval for the sizer to \"wipe off\" the excess of size, that is, to  run his hand along the twisted hank. This done, the hook commences to  revolve the reverse way, until the twists are taken out of the hank.  It is then removed, either by lifting off by hand or by the apparatus  shown, attached to the right hand side. This arrangement consists of a  lattice, carrying two arms that, at the proper moment, lift the hank off  the hooks on to the lattice proper, by which it is carried away, and  dropped upon a barrow to be taken to the drying stove. In sizing, a  double operation is customary; the first is called running, and the  second, finishing. In the machine shown, running is carried on one side  simultaneously with finishing in the other, or, if required, running  may be carried on on both sides. If desired, the lifting off motion is  attached to both running and finishing sides, and also the roller partly  seen on the left hand for running the hanks through the size. The  machine we saw was doing about 600 bundles per day at running and at  finishing, but the makers claim the production with a double machine to  be at the rate of about 36 10 lb. bundles per hour (at finishing), wrung  in 11/2 lb. wringers (or I1/2 lb. of yarn at a time), or at running at the  rate of 45 bundles in 2 lb. wringers. The distance between the hooks  is easily adjusted to the length or size of hanks, and altogether the  machine seems one that is worth the attention of the trade.    [Illustration: IMPROVED HANK SIZING MACHINE.]           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.      The working parts of the breaker now in use by the South Metropolitan  Gas Company consist essentially of a drum provided with cutting edges  projecting from it, which break up the coke against a fixed grid. The  drum is cast in rings, to facilitate repairs when necessary, and the  capacity of the machine can therefore be increased or diminished by  varying the number of these rings. The degree of fineness of the coke  when broken is determined by the regulated distance of the grid from the  drum. Thus there is only one revolving member, no toothed gearing being  required. Consequently the machine works with little power; the one at  the Old Kent Road, which is of the full size for large works, being  actually driven by a one horse power \"Otto\" gas-engine. Under these  conditions, at a recent trial, two tons of coke were broken in half an  hour, and the material delivered screened into the three classes of  coke, clean breeze (worth as much as the larger coke), and dust, which  at these works is used to mix with lime in the purifiers. The special  advantage of the machine, besides the low power required to drive it and  its simple action, lies in the small quantity of waste. On the occasion  of the trial in question, the dust obtained from two tons of coke  measured only 31/2 bushels, or just over a half hundredweight per ton.  The following statement, prepared from the actual working of the first  machine constructed, shows the practical results of its use. It should  be premised that the machine is assumed to be regularly employed and  driven by the full power for which it is designed, when it will easily  break 8 tons of coke per hour, or 80 tons per working day:        500 feet of gas consumed by a 2 horse power        gas-engine, at cost price of gas delivered   s. d.        in holder.                                   0  9      Oil and cotton waste.                          0  6      Two men supplying machine with large        coke, and shoveling up broken, at 4s.        6d.                                          9  0      Interest and wear and tear (say).              0  3                                                    -----           Total per day.                           10  6                                                    -----      For 80 tons per day, broken at the rate        of.                                          0  11/2      Add for loss by dust and waste, 1 cwt.,        with price of coke at (say) 13s. 4d. per        ton.                                         0  8                                                    -----          Cost of breaking, per ton.                 0  91/2    As coke, when broken, will usually fetch from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per ton  more than large, the result of using these machines is a net gain of  from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 9d. per ton of coke. It is not so much the actual  gain, however, that operates in favor of providing a supply of broken  coke, as the certainty that by so doing a market is obtained that would  not otherwise be available.    [Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]    It will not be overstating the case to say that this coke breaker is by  far the simplest, strongest, and most economical appliance of its kind  now manufactured. That it does its work well is proved by experience;  and the advantages of its construction are immediately apparent upon  comparison of its simple drum and single spindle with the flying hammers  or rocking jaws, or double drums with toothed gearing which characterize  some other patterns of the same class of plant. It should be remarked,  as already indicated, lest exception should be taken to the size of the  machine chosen here for illustration, that it can be made of any size  down to hand power. On the whole, however, as a few tons of broken coke  might be required at short notice even in a moderate sized works, it  would scarcely be advisable to depend upon too small a machine; since  the regular supply of the fuel thus improved may be trusted in a short  time to increase the demand.    [Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVEMENT IN PRINTING MACHINERY.      This is the design of Alfred Godfrey, of Clapton. According to this  improvement, as represented at Figs. 1 and 2, a rack, A, is employed  vibrating on the pivot a, and a pinion, a1, so arranged that instead of  the pinion moving on a universal joint, or the rack moving in a parallel  line from side to side of the pinion at the time the motion of the table  is reversed, there is employed, for example, the radial arm, a2, mounted  on the shaft, a3, supporting the driving wheel, a4. The opposite or  vibrating end of the radial arm, a2, supports in suitable bearings the  pinion, a1, and wheel, a5, driving the rack through the medium of the  driving wheel, a4, the effect of which is that through the mechanical  action of the vibrating arm, a2, and pinion, a1 in conjunction with the  vibrating movement of the rack, A, an easy, uniform, and silent motion  is transmitted to the rack and table.

A correspondent of the _Tribune_ describes at length the mining camps  about Lake Valley, New Mexico, hitherto thought likely to be the central  camp of that region, and then graphically tells the story of the recent  \"rush\" to the Perche district. Within a month of the first strike of  silver ore the country was swarming with prospectors, and a thousand or  more prospects had been located.    The Perche district is on the eastern flanks of the Mimbres Mountains,  a range which is a part of the Rocky Mountain range, and runs north and  south generally parallel with the Rio Grande, from which it lies about  forty miles to the westward. The northern half of these mountains is  known as the Black Range, and was the center of considerable mining  excitement a year and a half ago. It is there that the Ivanhoe is  located, of which Colonel Gillette was manager, and in which Robert  Ingersoll and Senator Plumb, of Kansas, were interested, much to the  disadvantage of the former. A new company has been organized, however,  with Colonel Ingersoll as president, and the reopening of work on the  Ivanhoe will probably prove a stimulus to the whole Black Range. From  this region the Perche district is from forty to sixty miles south. It  is about twenty-five miles northwest of Lake Valley, and ten miles west  of Hillsboro, a promising little mining town, with some mills and about  300 people. The Perche River has three forks coming down from the  mountains and uniting at Hillsboro, and it is in the region between  these forks that the recent strikes have been made.    On August 15 \"Jack\" Shedd, the original discoverer of the Robinson mine  in Colorado, was prospecting on the south branch of the north fork of  the Perche River, when he made the first great strike in the district.  On the summit of a heavily timbered ridge he found some small pieces of  native silver, and then a lump of ore containing very pure silver in the  form of sulphides, weighing 150 pounds, and afterward proved to be worth  on the average $11 a pound. All this was mere float, simply lying on the  surface of the ground. Afterward another block was found, weighing 87  pounds, of horn silver, with specimens nearly 75 per cent. silver. The  strike was kept a secret for a few days. Said a mining man: \"I went up  to help bring the big lump down. We took it by a camp of prospectors who  were lying about entirely ignorant of any find. When they saw it they  instantly saddled their horses, galloped off, and I believe they  prospected all night.\" A like excitement was created when the news of  this and one or two similar finds reached Lake Valley. Next morning  every waiter was gone from the little hotel, and a"]]]
