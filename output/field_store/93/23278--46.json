'I wish he may be an honest man, that's all,' said Solomon, winding up  a variety of speculations relative to the stranger, concerning whom  Gabriel had compared notes with the company, and so raised a grave  discussion; 'I wish he may be an honest man.'    'So we all do, I suppose, don't we?' observed the locksmith.    'I don't,' said Joe.    'No!' cried Gabriel.    'No. He struck me with his whip, the coward, when he was mounted and I  afoot, and I should be better pleased that he turned out what I think  him.'    'And what may that be, Joe?'    'No good, Mr Varden. You may shake your head, father, but I say no good,  and will say no good, and I would say no good a hundred times over, if  that would bring him back to have the drubbing he deserves.'    'Hold your tongue, sir,' said John Willet.    'I won't, father. It's all along of you that he ventured to do what he  did. Seeing me treated like a child, and put down like a fool, HE plucks  up a heart and has a fling at a fellow that he thinks--and may well  think too--hasn't a grain of spirit. But he's mistaken, as I'll show  him, and as I'll show all of you before long.'    'Does the boy know what he's a saying of!' cried the astonished John  Willet.    'Father,' returned Joe, 'I know what I say and mean, well--better than  you do when you hear me. I can bear with you, but I cannot bear the  contempt that your treating me in the way you do, brings upon me from  others every day. Look at other young men of my age. Have they no  liberty, no will, no right to speak? Are they obliged to sit mumchance,  and to be ordered about till they are the laughing-stock of young and  old? I am a bye-word all over Chigwell, and I say--and it's fairer  my saying so now, than waiting till you are dead, and I have got your  money--I say, that before long I shall be driven to break such bounds,  and that when I do, it won't be me that you'll have to blame, but your  own self, and no other.'    John Willet was so amazed by the exasperation and boldness of his  hopeful son, that he sat as one bewildered, staring in a ludicrous  manner at the boiler, and endeavouring, but quite ineffectually, to  collect his tardy thoughts, and invent an answer. The guests, scarcely  less disturbed, were equally at a loss; and at length, with a variety  of muttered, half-expressed condolences, and pieces of advice, rose to  depart; being at the same time slightly muddled with liquor.    The honest locksmith alone addressed a few words of coherent and  sensible advice to both parties, urging John Willet to remember that  Joe was nearly arrived at man's estate, and should not be ruled with  too tight a hand, and exhorting Joe himself to bear with his father's  caprices, and rather endeavour to turn them aside by temperate  remonstrance than by ill-timed rebellion. This advice was received as  such advice usually is. On John Willet it made almost as much impression  as on the sign outside the door, while Joe, who took it in the best  part, avowed himself more obliged than he could well express, but  politely intimated his intention nevertheless of taking his own course  uninfluenced by anybody.    'You have always been a very good friend to me, Mr Varden,' he said,  as they stood without, in the porch, and the locksmith was equipping  himself for his journey home; 'I take it very kind of you to say all  this, but the time's nearly come when the Maypole and I must part  company.'    'Roving stones gather no moss, Joe,' said Gabriel.    'Nor milestones much,' replied Joe. 'I'm little better than one here,  and see as much of the world.'    'Then, what would you do, Joe?' pursued the locksmith, stroking his chin  reflectively. 'What could you be? Where could you go, you see?'    'I must trust to chance, Mr Varden.'    'A bad thing to trust to, Joe. I don't like it. I always tell my girl  when we talk about a husband for her, never to trust to chance, but to  make sure beforehand that she has a good man and true, and then chance  will neither make her nor break her. What are you fidgeting about there,  Joe? Nothing gone in the harness, I hope?'    'No no,' said Joe--finding, however, something very engrossing to do in  the way of strapping and buckling--'Miss Dolly quite well?'    'Hearty, thankye. She looks pretty enough to be well, and good too.'    'She's always both, sir'--    'So she is, thank God!'    'I hope,' said Joe after some hesitation, 'that you won't tell this  story against me--this of my having been beat like the boy they'd make  of me--at all events, till I have met this man again and settled the  account. It'll be a better story then.'    'Why who should I tell it to?' returned Gabriel. 'They know it here, and  I'm not likely to come across anybody else who would care about it.'    'That's true enough,' said the young fellow with a sigh. 'I quite forgot  that. Yes, that's true!'    So saying, he raised his face, which was very red,--no doubt from the  exertion of strapping and buckling as aforesaid,--and giving the reins  to the old man, who had by this time taken his seat, sighed again and  bade him good night.    'Good night!' cried Gabriel. 'Now think better of what we have just  been speaking of; and don't be rash, there's a good fellow! I have an  interest in you, and wouldn't have you cast yourself away. Good night!'    Returning his cheery farewell with cordial goodwill, Joe Willet lingered  until the sound of wheels ceased to vibrate in his ears, and then,  shaking his head mournfully, re-entered the house.    Gabriel Varden went his way towards London, thinking of a great  many things, and most of all of flaming terms in which to relate his  adventure, and so account satisfactorily to Mrs Varden for visiting the  Maypole, despite certain solemn covenants between himself and that lady.  Thinking begets, not only thought, but drowsiness occasionally, and the  more the locksmith thought, the more sleepy he became.    A man may be very sober--or at least firmly set upon his legs on that  neutral ground which lies between the confines of perfect sobriety and  slight tipsiness--and yet feel a strong tendency to mingle up present  circumstances with others which have no manner of connection with them;  to confound all consideration of persons, things, times, and places;  and to jumble his disjointed thoughts together in a kind of mental  kaleidoscope, producing combinations as unexpected as they are  transitory. This was Gabriel Varden's state, as, nodding in his dog  sleep, and leaving his horse to pursue a road with which he was well  acquainted, he got over the ground unconsciously, and drew nearer and  nearer home. He had roused himself once, when the horse stopped until  the turnpike gate was opened, and had cried a lusty 'good night!' to the  toll-keeper; but then he awoke out of a dream about picking a lock in  the stomach of the Great Mogul, and even when he did wake, mixed up the  turnpike man with his mother-in-law who had been dead twenty years. It  is not surprising, therefore, that he soon relapsed, and jogged heavily  along, quite insensible to his progress.    And, now, he approached the great city, which lay outstretched before  him like a dark shadow on the ground, reddening the sluggish air with a  deep dull light, that told of labyrinths of public ways and shops, and  swarms of busy people. Approaching nearer and nearer yet, this halo  began to fade, and the causes which produced it slowly to develop  themselves. Long lines of poorly lighted streets might be faintly  traced, with here and there a lighter spot, where lamps were clustered  round a square or market, or round some great building; after a time  these grew more distinct, and the lamps themselves were visible; slight  yellow specks, that seemed to be rapidly snuffed out, one by one, as  intervening obstacles hid them from the sight. Then, sounds arose--the  striking of church clocks, the distant bark of dogs, the hum of traffic  in the streets; then outlines might be traced--tall steeples looming  in the air, and piles of unequal roofs oppressed by chimneys; then,  the noise swelled into a louder sound, and forms grew more distinct and  numerous still, and London--visible in the darkness by its own faint  light, and not by that of Heaven--was at hand.    The locksmith, however, all unconscious of its near vicinity, still  jogged on, half sleeping and half waking, when a loud cry at no great  distance ahead, roused him with a start.    For a moment or two he looked about him like a man who had been  transported to some strange country in his sleep, but soon recognising  familiar objects, rubbed his eyes lazily and might have relapsed again,  but that the cry was repeated--not once or twice or thrice, but many  times, and each time, if possible, with increased vehemence. Thoroughly  aroused, Gabriel, who was a bold man and not easily daunted, made  straight to the spot, urging on his stout little horse as if for life or  death.    The matter indeed looked sufficiently serious, for, coming to the place  whence the cries had proceeded, he descried the figure of a man extended  in an apparently lifeless state upon the pathway, and, hovering round  him, another person with a torch in his hand, which he waved in the air  with a wild impatience, redoubling meanwhile those cries for help which  had brought the locksmith to the spot.    'What's here to do?' said the old man, alighting. 'How's  this--what--Barnaby?'    The bearer of the torch shook his long loose hair back from his eyes,  and thrusting his face eagerly into that of the locksmith, fixed upon  him a look which told his history at once.    'You know me, Barnaby?' said Varden.    He nodded--not once or twice, but a score of times, and that with a  fantastic exaggeration which would have kept his head in motion for  an hour, but that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#7)"],[1,"records shows that there is no uniformity of  associational tendencies in this clinical group, but that several  tendencies are more or less frequently met with either alone or in  various combinations. Yet some of these tendencies, when appearing at  all prominently, are so highly characteristic of dementia præcox as to  be almost pathognomonic. Among these may be mentioned: (1) the  tendency to give _neologisms_, particularly those of the  senseless type; (2) the tendency to give unclassified reactions  largely of the _incoherent_ type; and (3) the tendency toward  _stereotypy_ manifested chiefly by abnormally frequent  repetitions of the same reaction. Fairly characteristic also is the  occasional tendency to give sound reactions. Again, occasionally one  encounters pronounced _perseveration_, and at least two of our  subjects gave a good many unclassified reactions obviously due to  _distraction_.    It must be noted that not infrequently cases of dementia præcox give  test records that cannot be distinguished from normal. It seems that  the pathological associational tendencies constitute merely a special  group of symptoms, some of which may be expected to be manifest in  cases which have reached a state of advanced mental deterioration, but  may not necessarily be present in the early stages of the disease. On  the other hand there is evidence to show that these tendencies may in  some cases appear among the earliest manifestations. This matter will  be referred to again.    Thus the test records of dementia præcox depart from the normal not  sharply but by a gradual shading off. We find similar gradual  transitions between dementia præcox and other psychoses. For this  work we selected cases in which the diagnoses were established with  reasonable certainty. Whether or not in cases of doubtful clinical  classification this association test may be of aid in determining the  diagnosis, is a question that must for the present remain open.    We submit herewith copies of test records. The numbers which appear  after the reactions indicate in each case the reaction type, in  accordance with Table III.
