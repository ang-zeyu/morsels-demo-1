[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#8)"],[1,"things are good for lives that should be restful.  Your uncle is  a strong man, with a very happy and placid nature.  Given health and  ordinary conditions of life, there is no reason why he should not live to  be a hundred.  You and I, therefore, who both love him, though in  different ways, should make it our business to protect him from all  disturbing influences.  I am sure you will agree with me that any labour  to this end would be well spent.  All right, my boy!  I see your answer  in your eyes; so we need say no more of that.  And now,\" here his voice  changed, \"tell me all that took place at that interview.  There are  strange things in front of us--how strange we cannot at present even  guess.  Doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie  behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to understand.  In  the meantime, all we can do is to work patiently, fearlessly, and  unselfishly, to an end that we think is right.  You had got so far as  where Lilla opened the door to Mr. Caswall and the negro.  You also  observed that Mimi was disturbed in her mind at the way Mr. Caswall  looked at her cousin.\"    \"Certainly--though 'disturbed' is a poor way of expressing her  objection.\"    \"Can you remember well enough to describe Caswall's eyes, and how Lilla  looked, and what Mimi said and did?  Also Oolanga, Caswall's West African  servant.\"    \"I'll do what I can, sir.  All the time Mr. Caswall was staring, he kept  his eyes fixed and motionless--but not as if he was in a trance.  His  forehead was wrinkled up, as it is when one is trying to see through or  into something.  At the best of times his face has not a gentle  expression; but when it was screwed up like that it was almost  diabolical.  It frightened poor Lilla so that she trembled, and after a  bit got so pale that I thought she had fainted.  However, she held up and  tried to stare back, but in a feeble kind of way.  Then Mimi came close  and held her hand.  That braced her up, and--still, never ceasing her  return stare--she got colour again and seemed more like herself.\"    \"Did he stare too?\"    \"More than ever.  The weaker Lilla seemed, the stronger he became, just  as if he were feeding on her strength.  All at once she turned round,  threw up her hands, and fell down in a faint.  I could not see what else  happened just then, for Mimi had thrown herself on her knees beside her  and hid her from me.  Then there was something like a black shadow  between us, and there was the nigger, looking more like a malignant devil  than ever.  I am not usually a patient man, and the sight of that ugly  devil is enough to make one's blood boil.  When he saw my face, he seemed  to realise danger--immediate danger--and slunk out of the room as  noiselessly as if he had been blown out.  I learned one thing, however--he  is an enemy, if ever a man had one.\"    \"That still leaves us three to two!\" put in Sir Nathaniel.    \"Then Caswall slunk out, much as the nigger had done.  When he had gone,  Lilla recovered at once.\"    \"Now,\" said Sir Nathaniel, anxious to restore peace, \"have you found out  anything yet regarding the negro?  I am anxious to be posted regarding  him.  I fear there will be, or may be, grave trouble with him.\"    \"Yes, sir, I've heard a good deal about him--of course it is not  official; but hearsay must guide us at first.  You know my man  Davenport--private secretary, confidential man of business, and general  factotum.  He is devoted to me, and has my full confidence.  I asked him  to stay on board the _West African_ and have a good look round, and find  out what he could about Mr. Caswall.  Naturally, he was struck with the  aboriginal savage.  He found one of the ship's stewards, who had been on  the regular voyages to South Africa.  He knew Oolanga and had made a  study of him.  He is a man who gets on well with niggers, and they open  their hearts to him.  It seems that this Oolanga is quite a great person  in the nigger world of the African West Coast.  He has the two things  which men of his own colour respect: he can make them afraid, and he is  lavish with money.  I don't know whose money--but that does not matter.  They are always ready to trumpet his greatness.  Evil greatness it is--but  neither does that matter.  Briefly, this is his history.  He was  originally a witch-finder--about as low an occupation as exists amongst  aboriginal savages.  Then he got up in the world and became an Obi-man,  which gives an opportunity to wealth _via_ blackmail.  Finally, he  reached the highest honour in hellish service.  He became a user of  Voodoo, which seems to be a service of the utmost baseness and cruelty.  I  was told some of his deeds of cruelty, which are simply sickening.  They  made me long for an opportunity of helping to drive him back to hell.  You  might think to look at him that you could measure in some way the extent  of his vileness; but it would be a vain hope.  Monsters such as he is  belong to an earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism.  He is in  his way a clever fellow--for a nigger; but is none the less dangerous or  the less hateful for that.  The men in the ship told me that he was a  collector: some of them had seen his collections.  Such collections!  All  that was potent for evil in bird or beast, or even in fish.  Beaks that  could break and rend and tear--all the birds represented were of a  predatory kind.  Even the fishes are those which are born to destroy, to  wound, to torture.  The collection, I assure you, was an object lesson in  human malignity.  This being has enough evil in his face to frighten even  a strong man.  It is little wonder that the sight of it put that poor  girl into a dead faint!\"    Nothing more could be done at the moment, so they separated.    Adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the Brow.  As  he was passing Diana's Grove, he looked in on the short avenue of trees,  and noticed the snakes killed on the previous morning by the mongoose.  They all lay in a row, straight and rigid, as if they had been placed by  hands.  Their skins seemed damp and sticky, and they were covered all  over with ants and other insects.  They looked loathsome, so after a  glance, he passed on.    A little later, when his steps took him, naturally enough, past the  entrance to Mercy Farm, he was passed by the negro, moving quickly under  the trees wherever there was shadow.  Laid across one extended arm,  looking like dirty towels across a rail, he had the horrid-looking  snakes.  He did not seem to see Adam.  No one was to be seen at Mercy  except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on the chance of  seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.    Once more he was passed on the way.  This time it was by Lady Arabella,  walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not recognise him,  even to the extent of acknowledging his bow.    When Adam got back to Lesser Hill, he went to the coach-house where the  box with the mongoose was kept, and took it with him, intending to finish  at the Mound of Stone what he had begun the previous morning with regard  to the extermination.  He found that the snakes were even more easily  attacked than on the previous day; no less than six were killed in the  first half-hour.  As no more appeared, he took it for granted that the  morning's work was over, and went towards home.  The mongoose had by this  time become accustomed to him, and was willing to let himself be handled  freely.  Adam lifted him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on.  Presently he saw a lady advancing towards him, and recognised Lady  Arabella.    Hitherto the mongoose had been quiet, like a playful affectionate kitten;  but when the two got close, Adam was horrified to see the mongoose, in a  state of the wildest fury, with every hair standing on end, jump from his  shoulder and run towards Lady Arabella.  It looked so furious and so  intent on attack that he called a warning.    \"Look out--look out!  The animal is furious and means to attack.\"    Lady Arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on; the  mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack.  Adam rushed forward with his  stick, the only weapon he had.  But just as he got within striking  distance, the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal, breaking his  backbone.  Not satisfied with this, she poured shot after shot into him  till the magazine was exhausted.  There was no coolness or hauteur about  her now; she seemed more furious even than the animal, her face  transformed with hate, and as determined to kill as he had appeared to  be.  Adam, not knowing exactly what to do, lifted his hat in apology and  hurried on to Lesser Hill.          CHAPTER VIII--SURVIVALS      At breakfast Sir Nathaniel noticed that Adam was put out about something,  but he said nothing.  The lesson of silence is better remembered in age  than in youth.  When they were both in the study, where Sir Nathaniel  followed him, Adam at once began to tell his companion of what had  happened.  Sir Nathaniel looked graver and graver as the narration  proceeded, and when Adam had stopped he remained silent for several  minutes, before speaking.    \"This is very grave.  I have not formed any opinion yet; but it seems to  me at first impression that this is worse than anything I had expected.\"    \"Why, sir?\" said Adam.  \"Is the killing of a mongoose--no matter by  whom--so serious a thing as all that?\"    His companion smoked on quietly for quite another few minutes before he  spoke.    \"When I have properly thought it over I may moderate my opinion, but in  the meantime it seems to me that there is something dreadful behind all  this--something that may affect all our lives--that may mean the issue of  life or death to any of us.\"    Adam sat up quickly.    \"Do tell me, sir, what is in your mind--if, of course, you have no  objection, or do not think it better to withhold"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#8)"],[1,"body, it seemed, had, somewhere, somehow, heard of a  Caroline Smith living in his own block, and every one remembered dimly  having passed a girl on the street who looked exactly like Caroline  Smith. But they went resolutely on, running down a thousand false  clues and finding at the end of each something more ludicrous than  what had gone before. Maiden ladies with many teeth and big glasses  they found; and they discovered, at the ends of the trails on which  they were advised to go, young women and old, ugly girls and pretty  ones, but never any one who in the slightest degree resembled Caroline  Smith.    In the meantime they were working back and forth, in their progress  along the East River, from the slums to the better residence  districts. They bought newspapers at little stationery stores and  worked up chance conversations with the clerks, particularly girl  clerks, whenever they could find them.    \"Because women have the eye for faces,\" Ronicky would say, \"and, if a  girl like Caroline Smith came into the shop, she'd be remembered for a  while.\"    But for ten days they labored without a ghost of a success. Then  they noticed the taxi stands along the East Side and worked them as  carefully as they could, and it was on the evening of the eleventh day  of the search that they reached the first clue.    They had found a taxi drawn up before a saloon, converted into an  eating place, and when they went inside they found the driver alone in  the restaurant. They worked up the conversation, as they had done a  hundred times before. Gregg produced the picture and began showing it  to Ronicky.    \"Maybe the lady's around here,\" said Ronicky, \"but I'm new in this  part of town.\" He took the picture and turned to the taxi driver.  \"Maybe you've been around this part of town and know the folks here.  Ever see this girl around?\" And he passed the picture to the other.    The taxi driver bowed his head over it in a close scrutiny. When he  looked up his face was a blank.    \"I don't know. Lemme see. I think I seen a girl like her the other  day, waiting for the traffic to pass at Seventy-second and Broadway.  Yep, she sure was a ringer for this picture.\" He passed the picture  back, and a moment later he finished his meal, paid his check and went  sauntering through the door.    \"Quick!\" said Ronicky, the moment the chauffeur had disappeared. \"Pay  the check and come along. That fellow knows something.\"    Bill Gregg, greatly excited, obeyed, and they hurried to the door of  the place. They were in time to see the taxicab lurch away from the  curb and go humming down the street, while the driver leaned out to  the side and looked back.    \"He didn't see us,\" said Ronicky confidently.    \"But what did he leave for?\"    \"He's gone to tell somebody, somewhere, that we're looking for  Caroline Smith. Come on!\" He stepped out to the curb and stopped a  passing taxi. \"Follow that machine and keep a block away from it,\" he  ordered.    \"Bootlegger?\" asked the taxi driver cheerily.    \"I don't know, but just drift along behind him till he stops. Can you  do that?\"    \"Watch me!\"    And, with Ronicky and Bill Gregg installed in his machine, he started  smoothly on the trail.    Straight down the cross street, under the roaring elevated tracks of  Second and Third Avenues, they passed, and on First Avenue they turned  and darted sharply south for a round dozen blocks, then went due east  and came, to a halt after a brief run.    \"He's stopped in Beekman Place,\" said the driver, jerking open the  door. \"If I run in there he'll see me.\"    Ronicky stepped from the machine, paid him and dismissed him with  a word of praise for his fine trailing. Then he stepped around the  corner.    What he saw was a little street closed at both ends and only two or  three blocks long. It had the serene, detached air of a village a  thousand miles from any great city, with its grave rows of homely  houses standing solemnly face to face. Well to the left, the  Fifty-ninth Street Bridge swung its great arch across the river, and  it led, Ronicky knew, to Long Island City beyond, but here everything  was cupped in the village quiet.    The machine which they had been pursuing was drawn up on the  right-hand side of the street, looking south, and, even as Ronicky  glanced around the corner, he saw the driver leave his seat, dart up a  flight of steps and ring the bell.    Ronicky could not see who opened the door, but, after a moment of  talk, the chauffeur from the car they had pursued was allowed to  enter. And, as he stepped across the threshold, he drew off his cap  with a touch of reverence which seemed totally out of keeping with his  character as Ronicky had seen it.    \"Bill,\" he said to Gregg, \"we've got something. You seen him go up  those steps to that house?\"    \"Sure.\"    Bill Gregg's eyes were flashing with the excitement. \"That house has  somebody in it who knows Caroline Smith, and that somebody is excited  because we're hunting for her,\" said Bill. \"Maybe it holds Caroline  herself. Who can tell that? Let's go see.\"    \"Wait till that taxi driver goes. If he'd wanted us to know about  Caroline he'd of told us. He doesn't want us to know and he'd maybe  take it pretty much to heart if he knew we'd followed him.\"    \"What he thinks don't worry me none. I can tend to three like him.\"    \"Maybe, but you couldn't handle thirty, and coyotes like him hunt in  packs, always. The best fighting pair of coyotes that ever stepped  wouldn't have no chance against a lofer wolf, but no lofer wolf could  stand off a dozen or so of the little devils. So keep clear of these  little rat-faced gents, Bill. They hunt in crowds.\"    Presently they saw the chauffeur coming down the steps. Even at that  distance it could be seen that he was smiling broadly, and that he was  intensely pleased with himself and the rest of the world.    Starting up his machine, he swung it around dexterously, as only New  York taxi drivers can, and sped down the street by the way he had  come, passing Gregg and Ronicky, who had flattened themselves against  the fence to keep from being seen. They observed that, while he  controlled the car with one hand, with the other he was examining the  contents of his wallet.    \"Money for him!\" exclaimed Ronicky, as soon as the car was out of  sight around the corner. \"This begins to look pretty thick, Bill.  Because he goes and tells them that he's taken us off the trail they  not only thank him, but they pay him for it. And, by the face of him,  as he went by, they pay him pretty high. Bill, it's easy to figure  that they don't want any friend near Caroline Smith, and most like  they don't even want us near that house.\"    \"I only want to go near once,\" said Bill Gregg. \"I just want to find  out if the girl is there.\"    \"Go break in on 'em?\"    \"Break in! Ronicky, that's burglary!\"    \"Sure it is.\"    \"Ill just ask for Caroline Smith at the door.\"    \"Try it.\"    The irony made Bill Gregg stop in the very act of leaving and glance  back. But he went on again resolutely and stamped up the steps to the  front door of the house.    It was opened to him almost at once by a woman, for Bill's hat come  off. For a moment he was explaining. Then there was a pause in his  gestures, as she made the reply. Finally he spoke again, but was cut  short by the loud banging of the door.    Bill Gregg drew himself up rigidly and slowly replaced the hat on his  head. If a man had turned that trick on him, a .45-caliber slug would  have gone crashing through the door in search of him to teach him a  Westerner's opinion of such manners.    Ronicky Doone could not help smiling to himself, as he saw Bill Gregg  stump stiffly down the stairs, limping a little on his wounded leg,  and come back with a grave dignity to the starting point. He was still  crimson to the roots of his hair.    \"Let's start,\" he said. \"If that happens again I'll be doing a couple  of murders in this here little town and getting myself hung.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"An old hag jerked open the door after I rang the bell. I asked her  nice and polite if a lady named Caroline Smith was in the house? 'No,'  says she, 'and if she was, what's that to you?' I told her I'd come a  long ways to see Caroline. 'Then go a long ways back without seeing  Caroline,' says this withered old witch, and she banged the door right  in my face. Man, I'm still seeing red. Them words of the old woman  were whips, and every one of them sure took off the hide. I used to  think that old lady Moore in Martindale was a pretty nasty talker, but  this one laid over her a mile. But we're beat, Ronicky. You couldn't  get by that old woman with a thousand men.\"    \"Maybe not,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"but we're going to try. Did you look  across the street and see a sign a while ago?\"    \"Which side?\"    \"Side right opposite Caroline's house.\"    \"Sure. 'Room To Rent.'\"    \"I thought so. Then that's our room.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"That's our room, partner, and right at the front window over the  street one of us is going to keep watch day and night, till we make  sure that Caroline Smith don't live in that house. Is that right?\"    \"That's a great idea!\" He started away from the fence.    \"Wait!\" Ronicky caught him by the shoulder and held him back. \"We'll  wait till night and then go and get that room. If Caroline is in the  house yonder, and they know we're looking for her, it's easy that she  won't be allowed to come out the front of the house so long as we're  perched up at the window, waiting to see her. We'll come back tonight  and start waiting.\"          Chapter Eight      _Two Apparitions_    They found that the room in the house on Beekman Place, opposite that  which they felt covered their quarry, could be secured, and they were  shown to it by a quiet old gentlewoman, found a big double room that  ran across the whole length of the house. From the back it looked down  on the lights glimmering on the"]]]
