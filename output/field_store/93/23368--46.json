One evening he had placed himself carelessly, and Charlotte happened by  accident to cast her eyes upon the page. His old impatience was aroused;  he turned to her, and said, almost unkindly:    [Illustration: EDWARD READING ALOUD TO CHARLOTTE AND THE CAPTAIN]    \"I do wish, once for all, you would leave off doing a thing so out of  taste and so disagreeable. When I read aloud to a person, is it not  the same as if I was telling him something by word of mouth? The  written, the printed word, is in the place of my own thoughts, of my own  heart. If a window were broken into my brain or into my heart, and if  the man to whom I am counting out my thoughts, or delivering my  sentiments, one by one, knew beforehand exactly what was to come out of  me, should I take the trouble to put them into words? When anybody looks  over my book, I always feel as if I were being torn in two.\"    Charlotte's tact, in whatever circle she might be, large or small, was  remarkable, and she was able to set aside disagreeable or excited  expressions without appearing to notice them. When a conversation grew  tedious, she knew how to interrupt it; when it halted, she could set it  going. And this time her good gift did not forsake her.    \"I am sure you will forgive me my fault,\" she said, when I tell you what  it was this moment which came over me. I heard you reading something  about Affinities, and I thought directly of some relations of mine, two  of whom are just now occupying me a great deal. Then my attention went  back to the book. I found it was not about living things at all, and I  looked over to get the thread of it right again.\"    \"It was the comparison which led you wrong and confused you,\" said  Edward. \"The subject is nothing but earths and minerals. But man is a  true Narcissus; he delights to see his own image everywhere; and he  spreads himself underneath the universe, like the amalgam behind the  glass.\"    \"Quite true,\" continued the Captain. \"That is the way in which he treats  everything external to himself. His wisdom and his folly, his will and  his caprice, he attributes alike to the animal, the plant, the elements,  and the gods.\"    \"Would you,\" said Charlotte, \"if it is not taking you away too much from  the immediate subject, tell me briefly what is meant here by  Affinities?\"    \"I shall be very glad indeed,\" replied the Captain, to whom Charlotte  had addressed herself. \"That is, I will tell you as well as I can. My  ideas on the subject date ten years back; whether the scientific world  continues to think the same about it, I cannot tell.\"    \"It is most disagreeable,\" cried Edward, \"that one cannot now-a-days  learn a thing once for all, and have done with it. Our forefathers could  keep to what they were taught when they were young; but we have, every  five years, to make revolutions with them, if we do not wish to drop  altogether out of fashion.\"    \"We women need not be so particular,\" said Charlotte; \"and, to speak the  truth, I only want to know the meaning of the word. There is nothing  more ridiculous in society than to misuse a strange technical word; and  I only wish you to tell me in what sense the expression is made use of  in connection with these things. What its scientific application is I am  quite contented to leave to the learned; who, by-the-by, as far as I  have been able to observe, do not find it easy to agree among  themselves.\"    \"Whereabouts shall we begin,\" said Edward, after a pause, to the  Captain, \"to come most quickly to the point?\"    The latter, after thinking as little while, replied shortly:    \"You must let me make what will seem a wide sweep; we shall be on our  subject almost immediately.\"    Charlotte settled her work at her side, promising the fullest attention.    The Captain began:    \"In all natural objects with which we are acquainted, we observe  immediately that they have a certain relation to themselves. It may  sound ridiculous to be asserting what is obvious to every one; but it is  only by coming to a clear understanding together about what we know,  that we can advance to what we do not know.\"    \"I think,\" interrupted Edward, \"we can make the thing more clear to her,  and to ourselves, with examples; conceive water, or oil, or quicksilver;  among these you will see a certain oneness, a certain connection of  their parts; and this oneness is never lost, except through force or  some other determining cause. Let the cause cease to operate, and at  once the parts unite again.\"    \"Unquestionably,\" said Charlotte, \"that is plain; rain-drops readily  unite and form streams; and when we were children, it was our delight to  play with quicksilver, and wonder at the little globules splitting and  parting and running into one another.\"    \"And here,\" said the Captain, \"let me just cursorily mention one  remarkable thing--I mean, that the full, complete correlation of parts  which the fluid state makes possible, shows itself distinctly and  universally in the globular form. The falling water-drop is round; you  yourself spoke of the globules of quicksilver; and a drop of melted lead  let fall, if it has time to harden before it reaches the ground, is  found at the bottom in the shape of a ball.\"    \"Let me try and see,\" said Charlotte, \"whether I can understand where  you are bringing me. As everything has a reference to itself, so it must  have some relation to others.\"    \"And that,\" interrupted Edward, \"will be different according to the  natural differences of the things themselves. Sometimes they will meet  like friends and old acquaintances; they will come rapidly together, and  unite without either having to alter itself at all--as wine mixes with  water. Others, again, will remain as strangers side by side, and no  amount of mechanical mixing or forcing will succeed in combining them.  Oil and water may be shaken up together, and the next moment they are  separate again, each by itself.\"    \"One can almost fancy,\" said Charlotte, \"that in these simple forms one  sees people that one is acquainted with; one has met with just such  things in the societies amongst which one has lived; and the strangest  likenesses of all with these soulless creatures are in the masses in  which men stand divided one against the other, in their classes and  professions; the nobility and the third estate, for instance, or  soldiers and civilians.\"    \"Then again,\" replied Edward, \"as these are united under common laws and  customs, so there are intermediate members in our chemical world which  will combine elements that are mutually repulsive.\"    \"Oil, for instance,\" said the Captain, \"we make combine with water with  the help of alkalis----\"    \"Do not go on too fast with your lesson,\" said Charlotte. \"Let me see  that I keep step with you. Are we not here arrived among the  affinities?\"    \"Exactly,\" replied the Captain; \"we are on the point of apprehending  them in all their power and distinctness; such natures as, when they  come in contact, at once lay hold of each other, each mutually affecting  the other, we speak of as having an affinity one for the other. With the  alkalis and acids, for instance, the affinities are strikingly marked.  They are of opposite natures; very likely their being of opposite  natures is the secret of their inter-relational effect--each reaches out  eagerly for its companion, they lay hold of each other, modify each  other's character, and form in connection an entirely new substance.  There is lime, you remember, which shows the strongest inclination for  all sorts of acids--a distinct desire of combining with them. As soon as  our chemical chest arrives, we can show you a number of entertaining  experiments which will give you a clearer idea than words, and names,  and technical expressions.\"    \"It appears to me,\" said Charlotte, \"that, if you choose to call these  strange creatures of yours related, the relationship is not so much a  relationship of blood as of soul or of spirit. It is the way in which we  see all really deep friendship arise among men, opposite peculiarities  of disposition being what best makes internal union possible. But I will  wait to see what you can really show me of these mysterious proceedings;  and for the present,\" she added, turning to Edward, \"I will promise not  to disturb you any more in your reading. You have taught me enough of  what it is about to enable me to attend to it.\"    \"No, no,\" replied Edward, \"now that you have once stirred the thing, you  shall not get off so easily. It is just the most complicated cases which  are the most interesting. In these you come first to see the degrees of  the affinities, to watch them as their power of attraction is weaker or  stronger, nearer or more remote. Affinities begin really to interest  only when they bring about separations.\"    \"What!\" cried Charlotte, \"is that miserable word, which unhappily we  hear so often now-a-days in the world; is that to be found in nature's  lessons too?\"    \"Most certainly,\" answered Edward; \"the title with which chemists were  supposed to be most honorably distinguished was, artists of separation.\"    \"It is not so any more,\" replied Charlotte; \"and it is well that it is  not. It is a higher art, and it is a higher merit, to unite. An artist  of union is what we should welcome in every province of the universe.  However, as we are on the subject again, give me an instance or two of  what you mean.\"    \"We had better keep,\" said the Captain, \"to the same instances of which  we have already been speaking. Thus, what we call limestone is a more or  less pure calcareous earth in combination with a delicate acid, which is  familiar to us in the form of a gas. Now, if we place a piece of this  stone in diluted sulphuric acid, this will take possession of the lime,  and appear with it in the form of gypsum, the gaseous acid at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#8)"],[1,"to  be governed was enormous, but the communications in northern China at  that time were similar to those still existing not long ago in southern  China--narrow footpaths from one settlement to another. It is very  difficult to build roads in the loess of northern China; and the  war-chariots that required roads had only just been introduced. Under  such conditions, the simplest way of administering the empire was to  establish garrisons of the invading tribes in the various parts of the  country under the command of their chieftains. Thus separate regions of  the country were distributed as fiefs. If a former subject of the Shang  surrendered betimes with the territory under his rule, or if there was  one who could not be overcome by force, the Chou recognized him as a  feudal lord.    We find in the early Chou time the typical signs of true feudalism:  fiefs were given in a ceremony in which symbolically a piece of earth  was handed over to the new fiefholder, and his instalment, his rights  and obligations were inscribed in a \"charter\". Most of the fiefholders  were members of the Chou ruling family or members of the clan to which  this family belonged; other fiefs were given to heads of the allied  tribes. The fiefholder (feudal lord) regarded the land of his fief, as  far as he and his clan actually used it, as \"clan\" land; parts of this  land he gave to members of his own branch-clan for their use without  transferring rights of property, thus creating new sub-fiefs and  sub-lords. In much later times the concept of landed property of a  _family_ developed, and the whole concept of \"clan\" disappeared. By 500  B.C., most feudal lords had retained only a dim memory that they  originally belonged to the Chi clan of the Chou or to one of the few  other original clans, and their so-called sub-lords felt themselves as  members of independent noble families. Slowly, then, the family names of  later China began to develop, but it took many centuries until, at the  time of the Han Dynasty, all citizens (slaves excluded) had accepted  family names. Then, reversely, families grew again into new clans.    Thus we have this picture of the early Chou state: the imperial central  power established in Shensi, near the present Sian; over a thousand  feudal states, great and small, often consisting only of a small  garrison, or sometimes a more considerable one, with the former  chieftain as feudal lord over it. Around these garrisons the old  population lived on, in the north the Shang population, farther east and  south various other peoples and cultures. The conquerors' garrisons were  like islands in a sea. Most of them formed new towns, walled, with a  rectangular plan and central crossroads, similar to the European towns  subsequently formed out of Roman encampments. This town plan has been  preserved to the present day.    This upper class in the garrisons formed the nobility; it was sharply  divided from the indigenous population around the towns The conquerors  called the population \"the black-haired people\", and themselves \"the  hundred families\". The rest of the town populations consisted often of  urban Shang people: Shang noble families together with their bondsmen  and serfs had been given to Chou fiefholders. Such forced resettlements  of whole populations have remained typical even for much later periods.  By this method new cities were provided with urban, refined people and,  most important, with skilled craftsmen and businessmen who assisted in  building the cities and in keeping them alive. Some scholars believe  that many resettled Shang urbanites either were or became businessmen;  incidentally, the same word \"Shang\" means \"merchant\", up to the present  time. The people of the Shang capital lived on and even attempted a  revolt in collaboration with some Chou people. The Chou rulers  suppressed this revolt, and then transferred a large part of this  population to Loyang. They were settled there in a separate community,  and vestiges of the Shang population were still to be found there in the  fifth century A.D.: they were entirely impoverished potters, still  making vessels in the old style.    3 _Fusion of Chou and Shang_    The conquerors brought with them, for their own purposes to begin with,  their rigid patriarchate in the family system and their cult of Heaven  (t'ien), in which the worship of sun and stars took the principal place;  a religion most closely related to that of the Turkish peoples and  derived from them. Some of the Shang popular deities, however, were  admitted into the official Heaven-worship. Popular deities became  \"feudal lords\" under the Heaven-god. The Shang conceptions of the soul  were also admitted into the Chou religion: the human body housed two  souls, the personality-soul and the life-soul. Death meant the  separation of the souls from the body, the life-soul also slowly dying.  The personality-soul, however, could move about freely and lived as long  as there were people who remembered it and kept it from hunger by means  of sacrifices. The Chou systematized this idea and made it into the  ancestor-worship that has endured down to the present time.    The Chou officially abolished human sacrifices, especially since, as  former pastoralists, they knew of better means of employing prisoners of  war than did the more agrarian Shang. The Chou used Shang and other  slaves as domestic servants for their numerous nobility, and Shang serfs  as farm labourers on their estates. They seem to have regarded the land  under their control as \"state land\" and all farmers as \"serfs\". A slave,  here, must be defined as an individual, a piece of property, who was  excluded from membership in human society but, in later legal texts, was  included under domestic animals and immobile property, while serfs as a  class depended upon another class and had certain rights, at least the  right to work on the land. They could change their masters if the land  changed its master, but they could not legally be sold individually.  Thus, the following, still rather hypothetical, picture of the land  system of the early Chou time emerges: around the walled towns of the  feudal lords and sub-lords, always in the plains, was \"state land\" which  produced millet and more and more wheat. Cultivation was still largely  \"shifting\", so that the serfs in groups cultivated more or less  standardized plots for a year or more and then shifted to other plots.  During the growing season they lived in huts on the fields; during the  winter in the towns in adobe houses. In this manner the yearly life  cycle was divided into two different periods. The produce of the serfs  supplied the lords, their dependants and the farmers themselves.  Whenever the lord found it necessary, the serfs had to perform also  other services for the lord. Farther away from the towns were the  villages of the \"natives\", nominally also subjects of the lord. In most  parts of eastern China, these, too, were agriculturists. They  acknowledged their dependence by sending \"gifts\" to the lord in the  town. Later these gifts became institutionalized and turned into a form  of tax. The lord's serfs, on the other hand, tended to settle near the  fields in villages of their own because, with growing urban population,  the distances from the town to many of the fields became too great. It  was also at this time of new settlements that a more intensive  cultivation with a fallow system began. At latest from the sixth century  B.C. on, the distinctions between both land systems became unclear; and  the pure serf-cultivation, called by the old texts the \"well-field  system\" because eight cultivating families used one common well,  disappeared in practice.    The actual structure of early Chou administration is difficult to  ascertain. The \"Duke of Chou\", brother of the first ruler, Wu Wang,  later regent during the minority of Wu Wang's son, and certainly one of  the most influential persons of this time, was the alleged creator of  the book _Chou-li_ which contains a detailed table of the bureaucracy of  the country. However, we know now from inscriptions that the bureaucracy  at the beginning of the Chou period was not much more developed than in  late Shang time. The _Chou-li_ gave an ideal picture of a bureaucratic  state, probably abstracted from actual conditions in feudal states  several centuries later.    The Chou capital, at Sian, was a twin city. In one part lived the  master-race of the Chou with the imperial court, in the other the  subjugated population. At the same time, as previously mentioned, the  Chou built a second capital, Loyang, in the present province of Honan.  Loyang was just in the middle of the new state, and for the purposes of  Heaven-worship it was regarded as the centre of the universe, where it  was essential that the emperor should reside. Loyang was another twin  city: in one part were the rulers' administrative buildings, in the  other the transferred population of the Shang capital, probably artisans  for the most part. The valuable artisans seem all to have been taken  over from the Shang, for the bronze vessels of the early Chou age are  virtually identical with those of the Shang age. The shapes of the  houses also remained unaltered, and probably also the clothing, though  the Chou brought with them the novelties of felt and woollen fabrics,  old possessions of their earlier period. The only fundamental material  change was in the form of the graves: in the Shang age house-like tombs  were built underground; now great tumuli were constructed in the fashion  preferred by all steppe peoples.    One professional class was severely hit by the changed  circumstances--the Shang priesthood. The Chou had no priests. As with  all the races of the steppes, the head of the family himself performed  the religious rites. Beyond this there were only shamans for certain  purposes of magic. And very soon Heaven-wor"]]]
