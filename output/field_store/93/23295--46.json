[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#7)"],[1,"he, who prided himself on \"not bothering\" with  women, trouble to provide a dragoman at Alexandria?    I hurried to the dining car, and found Monny with her satellites seated  at a table, three of them looking as calmly innocent as if they had not  upset my well-laid scheme for their comfort. Biddy alone had a guilty  air, because, perhaps, I was more important in her eyes than in the  eyes of the others. \"Oh, dear Duffer,\" she began to wheedle me: \"We  hope you don't mind our coming here? We thought it a good idea, for  we're starving, although we're perfectly happy because we're in Egypt,  and because it's such a _quaint_ train, so different and Eastern. The  dragoman who----\"    \"I think he came from your friend Anthony with an 'H,'\" Cleopatra broke  in. \"He seemed providential. And he speaks English. The only objection  is, he's not as good-looking as Monny and I wanted our dragoman to be.  We did hope to get one who would be _becoming_ to us, you see, and give  the right sort of Eastern background. But I suppose one can't have  _everything!_ And it was I who said your friend Anthony's messenger  must be engaged even if his face is--is--rather like an _accident!_\"    \"It's like a catastrophe,\" remarked Monny, looking as if she blamed me.    \"Where _is_ it?\" I wanted to know.    \"It's waiting in a vestibule outside where the cook's cooking,\" Biddy  explained ungrammatically. \"I told it you'd want to see it. And it's  got a letter for you from some one.\" \"Did the fellow say the letter was  from Fenton?\" I inquired.    \"No. He only said, from a friend who'd expected to meet you; and Mrs.  East was sure it must be from the one you were talking about.\"    Wasting no more words, I marched off to the fountainhead for  information. Near the open door of the infinitesimal kitchen stood a  fat little dark man with a broken nose, and one white eye. The other  eye, as if to make up, was singularly, repellently intelligent. It  fixed itself upon me, as I approached, with eager questioning which  melted into ingratiating politeness. Instinct warned the fellow that I  was the person he awaited. At the same moment, instinct was busily  whispering to me that there was something fishy about him, despite the  alleged letter. He did not look the type of man Fenton would recommend.  And though his face was of an unwholesome olive tint, and he wore a  tarbush, and a galabeah as long as a dressing-gown, under his short  European coat, I was sure he was not of Arab or Egyptian blood.    \"Milord Borrow?\" he began, displaying large white teeth, of which he  was evidently proud.    I assented.    \"My name is Bedr el Gemaly,\" he introduced himself. \"I have a letter  for milord.\"    \"Who gave it to you?\" I challenged him.    The ingratiating smile seemed to flicker like a candle flame in a  sudden puff of wind. \"A friend of my, a dragoman. He could not come to  bring it. So he give it to me. The gentleman's name was Fenton. My  friend, he was sent from him at Cairo.\" As the fellow spoke, in fairly  good English, he took from a pocket of the short coat which spoiled his  costume, a colourful silk handkerchief. Unwrapping this, he produced an  envelope. It was addressed to me in the handwriting of Fenton, but  before opening it I went on with my catechism.    \"Then the letter doesn't introduce you, but your friend?\"    The smile was practically dead now. \"I think it do not introduce any  ones. It is only a letter. My friend Abdullah engaged to carry it. But  he got sick too soon to come to the ship.\"    \"I see,\" said I. \"You seem to have used the letter, however, to get  yourself taken on as dragoman by the ladies of my party. How the devil  did you find out that they were travelling with me, eh?\" I shot the  question at him and tried to imitate gimlets with my eyes. But he was  ready with his answer. No doubt he had prepared it.    \"I see you all together, from a distant place, before I come there. A  gentleman off the ship, he pointed you out when I ask where I find  Milord Borrow. I see you, and those ladies. When I come, you was away  already, so I speak to them, and say if I could help, I be very  pleased. When I tell one of the ladies I was from a friend of milord's  with a letter, she say, is the friend's name Captain Fenton, and I say  'yes, madame, Captain Fenton, that is the name; and I am a dragoman to  show Egypt to the strangers. I know it all very well, from Alexandria  way up Nile.' Then the lady say very quick she will take me for her  dragoman. I am pleased, for I was not engaged for season, and she say  if I satisfy her she keep me in Cairo and on from there.\" \"H'm,\" I  grunted, still screwing in the gimlets. \"I see you're not an Egyptian.  You have selected the name of an Armenian famous in history. Are you  Armenian?\"    \"I am the same thing as Egyptian, I bin here for dragoman so many  years. I am Mussulman in faith. But I was born Armenian,\" he admitted.    \"You speak English with an American accent,\" I went on. \"Have you lived  in America?\"    \"One time a family take me to New York and I stay a year or two. Then I  get homesick and come to Egypt again. But I learn to talk maybe some  like American peoples while I am over there.\"    It sounded plausible enough, the whole story. And if Mrs. East had  snapped the dragoman up under the impression that he came from a man  she had determined to meet, the fellow might be no more to blame than  any other boaster, touting in his own interest. Still, I had an uneasy  feeling that something lay hidden under Armenian plausibility. Bedr el  Gemaly was perhaps a thief who had courted a chance for a big haul of  jewellery. Yet if that were all, why hadn't he hopped off the tram, as  it began to move, with the ladies' hand luggage? He might easily have  got away, and disappeared into space, before we could wire the police  of Alexandria to look out for him. He had not done that, but had  waited, and risked facing my suspicions. And he must have realized,  while in charge of Monny's and Cleopatra's attractive dressing bags,  that he was missing an opportunity such as might never come to him  again. This conduct suggested an honest desire to be a good dragoman.  Yet--well, I resolved not to let the gimlets rust until Bedr el Gemaly  had been got rid of. If Mrs. East had really promised him a permanent  engagement, she could salve his disappointment by giving him a day's  pay. I would take the responsibility of sending him about his business.    Without further parley I opened the letter. It was short, evidently  written in a hurry. Anthony had scribbled:    Horribly sorry, dear old Duffer, but I'm wanted by the Powers that Be  in Cairo. No other reason could have kept me from Alexandria. I was  afraid a wire wouldn't reach you, so I sent a decent old chap by the  train I meant to take. He's pledged to find you on the quay, and he  will--unless some one makes him drunk. This seems unlikely to happen,  as he won't be paid till he gets back, and having no friends on earth,  nobody will stand him drinks. Beastly luck, but I shan't be able to see  you to-night even in Cairo. Tell you all to-morrow--and there's a lot  to tell, about many things.    Yours ever,    A.F.    The messenger had \"no friend on earth,\" according to Fenton. Then the  friendship stated to exist between him and Bedr el Gemaly must have  come readymade from heaven, or--its opposite. I guessed the nature of  the \"decent old chap's\" illness. But I should have been glad to know  whether it had been produced by design or accident.    When I went back to the ladies, Bedr went with me, at my firm  suggestion, and gave them their handbags to use as footstools. Dinner  was ready, and a seat had been kept for me at a table just across the  aisle, but before beginning, I explained the real circumstances  governing the dragoman's arrival. \"Whatever else he may be, he's a  shark,\" I said, \"or he wouldn't have traded on a misunderstanding to  grab an engagement. You owe him nothing really, but if you choose, give  him a sovereign when we get to Cairo, and I'll tell him that I have a  dragoman in view for the party. He'll then have two days' pay,  according to the guide-books.\"    With this, I slipped into my seat, thinking the matter settled. But  between courses, Monny leaned across from her table (she and I had end  seats) and said that she and her aunt had been talking about that poor  dragoman. \"Aunt Clara raised his hopes,\" the girl went on, \"and now  Rachel Guest and I think it would be mean to send him away, just  because he's hideous.\"    \"That won't be the reason!\" said I. \"It will be because we don't know  anything about him, and because in his sharpness he's over-reached  himself.\"    \"But we do know things about him. He showed Aunt Clara letters from  people who'd employed him, lots of Americans whose names we've heard,  and some we're acquainted with. The tragic thing is, that he finds  difficulty in getting engaged because of his face. I've felt guilty  ever since I called it a catastrophe. Of course it _is_; but I said it  to be funny, which was cruel. And we deserve to punish ourselves by  keeping the poor wretch a few days, or more, if he's good.\"    \"I thought you wanted a becoming dragoman?\" I reminded her.    \"Oh, that was just our silliness. I _do_ like good-looking people, I  must say. But what _does_ it matter whether a brown person is handsome  or homely, when you come to think of it? Besides, we can have another  dragoman, too, for ornament, if we run across a very picturesque one.\"    I laughed. \"But you can't go up the Nile on a boat with a drove of  private dragomans, you know!\"    \"I _don't_ know, Lord Ernest. And why don't you call them dragomen? You  make them sound as if they were some kind of animal.\"    \"Dragomans is the plural,\" I persisted.    \"Well, I shall call them dragomen. And if this poor thing can't get any  one else to drag, he _shall_ drag us up the Nile, if he's as  intelligent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#7)"],[1,".'\"    \"So it is,\" said Levy with an oath. \"This is a very bad case, Mr.  Raffles.\"    \"I agree,\" said I. \"And may I ask if you propose to 'get rid' of Mr.  Garland by making him 'pay up' in full?\"    \"Before twelve o'clock to-day,\" said Dan Levy, with a snap of his  prize-fighting jaws.    \"Eight hundred, first and last, for the three hundred he borrowed a  year ago?\"    \"That's it.\"    \"Surely that's very hard on the boy,\" I said, reaching the conciliatory  stage by degrees on which Raffles paid me many compliments later; but at  the time he remarked, \"I should say it was his own fault.\"    \"Of course it is, Mr. Raffles,\" cried the moneylender, taking a more  conciliatory tone himself. \"It was my money; it was my three 'undred  golden sovereigns; and you can sell what's yours for what it'll fetch,  can't you?\"    \"Obviously,\" said Raffles.    \"Very well, then, money's like anything else; if you haven't got it, and  can't beg or earn it, you've got to buy it at a price. I sell my money,  that's all. And I've a right to sell it at a fancy price if I can get a  fancy price for it. A man may be a fool to pay my figure; that depends  'ow much he wants the money at the time, and it's his affair, not mine.  Your gay young friend was all right if he hadn't defaulted, but a  defaulter deserves to pay through the nose, and be damned to him. It  wasn't me let your friend in; he let in himself, with his eyes open. Mr.  Garland knew very well what I was charging him, and what I shouldn't  'esitate to charge over and above if he gave me half a chance. Why should  I? Wasn't it in the bond? What do you all think I run my show for? It's  business, Mr. Raffles, not robbery, my dear sir. All business is  robbery, if you come to that. But you'll find mine is all above-board and  in the bond.\"    \"A very admirable exposition,\" said Raffles weightily.    \"Not that it applies to you, Mr. Raffles,\" the other was adroit enough to  add. \"Mr. Garland was no friend of mine, and he was a fool, whereas I  hope I may say that you're the one and not the other.\"    \"Then it comes to this,\" said I, \"that you mean him to pay up in full  this morning?\"    \"By noon, and it's just gone ten.\"    \"The whole seven hundred pounds?\"    \"Sterling,\" said Mr. Levy \"No cheques entertained.\"    \"Then,\" said I, with an air of final defeat, \"there's nothing for it but  to follow my instructions and pay you now on the nail!\"    I did not look at Levy, but I heard the sudden intake of his breath at  the sight of my bank-notes, and I felt its baleful exhalation on my  forehead as I stooped and began counting them out upon his desk. I had  made some progress before he addressed me in terms of protest. There was  almost a tremor in his voice. I had no call to be so hasty; it looked as  though I had been playing a game with him. Why couldn't I tell him I had  the money with me all the time? The question was asked with a sudden  oath, because I had gone on counting it out regardless of his overtures.  I took as little notice of his anger.    \"And now, Mr. Levy,\" I concluded, \"may I ask you to return me Mr.  Garland's promissory note?\"    \"Yes, you may ask and you shall receive!\" he snarled, and opened his safe  so violently that the keys fell out. Raffles replaced them with exemplary  promptitude while the note of hand was being found.    The evil little document was in my possession at last. Levy roared down  the tube, and the young man of the imperfect diction duly appeared.    \"Take that young biter,\" cried Levy, \"and throw him into the street. Call  up Moses to lend you a 'and.\"    But the first murderer stood nonplussed, looking from Raffles to me, and  finally inquiring which biter his master meant.    \"That one!\" bellowed the money-lender, shaking a lethal fist at me. \"Mr.  Raffles is a friend o' mine.\"    \"But 'e'th a friend of 'ith too,\" lisped the young man. \"Thimeon Markth  come acroth the thtreet to tell me tho. He thaw them thake handth  outthide our plathe, after he'd theen 'em arm-in-arm in Piccadilly, 'an  he come in to thay tho in cathe--\"    But the youth of limited articulation was not allowed to finish his  explanation; he was grasped by the scruff of the neck and kicked and  shaken out of the room, and his collar flung after him. I heard him  blubbering on the stairs as Levy locked the door and put the key in his  pocket. But I did not hear Raffles slip into the swivel chair behind  the desk, or know that he had done so until the usurer and I turned  round together.    \"Out of that!\" blustered Levy.    But Raffles tilted the chair back on its spring and laughed softly  in his face.    \"Not if I know it,\" said he. \"If you don't open the door in about one  minute I shall require this telephone of yours to ring up the police.\"    \"The police, eh?\" said Levy, with a sinister recovery of self-control.  \"You'd better leave that to me, you precious pair of swindlers!\"    \"Besides,\" continued Raffles, \"of course you keep an _argumentum ad  hominem_ in one of these drawers. Ah, here it is, and just as well in my  hands as in yours!\"    He had opened the top drawer in the right-hand pedestal, and taken  therefrom a big bulldog revolver; it was the work of few moments to empty  its five chambers, and hand the pistol by its barrel to the owner.    \"Curse you!\" hissed the latter, hurling it into the fender with a fearful  clatter. \"But you'll pay for this, my fine gentlemen; this isn't sharp  practice, but criminal fraud.\"    \"The burden of proof,\" said Raffles, \"lies with you. Meanwhile, will you  be good enough to open that door instead of looking as sick as a cold  mud-poultice?\"    The money-lender had, indeed, turned as grey as his hair; and his  eyebrows, which were black and looked dyed, stood out like smears of ink.  Nevertheless, the simile which Raffles had employed with his own  unfortunate facility was more picturesque than discreet. I saw it set Mr.  Shylock thinking. Luckily, the evil of the day was sufficient for it and  him; but so far from complying, he set his back to the locked door and  swore a sweet oath never to budge.    \"Oh, very well!\" resumed Raffles, and the receiver was at his ear without  more ado. \"Is that the Exchange? Give me nine-two-double-three Gerrard,  will you?\"    \"It's fraud,\" reiterated Levy. \"And you know it.\"    \"It's nothing of the sort, and _you_ know it,\" murmured Raffles, with  the proper pre-occupation of the man at the telephone.    \"You lent the money,\" I added. \"That's your business. It's nothing to do  with you what he chooses to do with it.\"    \"He's a cursed swindler,\" hissed Levy. \"And you're his damned decoy!\"    I was not sorry to see Raffles's face light up across the desk.    \"Is that Howson, Anstruther and Martin?--they're only my solicitors, Mr.  Levy.... Put me through to Mr. Martin, please.... That you, Charlie? ...  You might come in a cab to Jermyn Street--I forget the number--Dan  Levy's, the money-lender's--thanks, old chap! ... Wait a bit, Charlie--a  constable....\"    But Dan Levy had unlocked his door and flung it open.    \"There you are, you scoundrels! But we'll meet again, my fine  swell-mobsmen!\"    Raffles was frowning at the telephone.    \"I've been cut off,\" said he. \"Wait a bit! Clear call for you, Mr. Levy,  I believe!\"    And they changed places, without exchanging another word until Raffles  and I were on the stairs.    \"Why, the 'phone's not even _through!_\" yelled the money-lender,  rushing out.    \"But _we_ are, Mr. Levy!\" cried Raffles. And down we ran into the street.          CHAPTER V    Thin Air      Raffles hailed a passing hansom, and had bundled me in before I realised  that he was not coming with me.    \"Drive down to the club for Teddy's cricket-bag,\" said he; \"we'll make  him get straight into flannels to save time. Order breakfast for three in  half-an-hour precisely, and I'll tell him everything before you're back.\"    His eyes were shining with the prospect as I drove away, not sorry to  escape the scene of that young man's awakening to better fortune than he  deserved. For in my heart I could not quite forgive the act in which  Raffles and I had caught him overnight. Raffles might make as light of it  as he pleased; it was impossible for another to take his affectionately  lenient view, not of the moral question involved, but of the breach of  faith between friend and friend. My own feeling in the matter, however,  if a little jaundiced, was not so strong as to prevent me from gloating  over the victory in which I had just assisted. I thought of the notorious  extortioner who had fallen to our unscrupulous but not indictable wiles;  and my heart tinkled with the hansom bell. I thought of the good that we  had done for once, of the undoubted wrong we had contrived to right by a  species of justifiable chicanery. And I forgot all about the youth whose  battle we had fought and won, until I found myself ordering his  breakfast, and having his cricket-bag taken out to my cab.    Raffles was waiting for me in the Albany courtyard. I thought he was  frowning at the sky, which was not what it had been earlier in the  morning, until I remembered how little time there was to lose.    \"Haven't you seen anything of him?\" he cried as I jumped out.    \"Of whom, Raffles?\"    \"Teddy, of course!\"    \"Teddy Garland? Has he gone out?\"    \"Before I got in,\" said Raffles, grimly. \"I wonder where the devil he  is!\"    He had paid the cabman and taken down the bag himself. I followed him up  to his rooms.    \"But what's the meaning of it, Raffles?\"    \"That's what I want to know.\"    \"Could he have gone out for a paper?\"    \"They were all here before I went. I left them on his bed.\"    \"Or for a shave?\"    \"That's more likely; but he's been out nearly an hour.\"    \"But you can't have been gone much longer yourself, Raffles, and I  understood you left him fast asleep?\"    \"That's the worst of it, Bunny. He must have been shamming. Barraclough  saw him go out ten minutes after me.\""]]]
