An Elizabethan might well be astonished by what he  would see at any modern Lloyd's. Yet he would find the same essentials;  for the British Lloyd's, like most of its foreign imitators, is not a  gigantic insurance company at all, but an association of cautiously  elected members who carry on their completely independent private  business in daily touch with each other--precisely as Elizabethans did.  Lloyd's method differs wholly from ordinary insurance. Instead of  insuring vessel and cargo with a single company or man the owner puts  his case before Lloyd's, and any member can then write his name  underneath for any reasonable part of the risk. The modern  'underwriter,' all the world over, is the direct descendant of the  Elizabethan who wrote his name under the conditions of a given risk at  sea.    Joint-stock companies were in one sense old when Elizabethan men of  business were young. But the Elizabethans developed them enormously.  'Going shares' was doubtless prehistoric. It certainly was ancient,  medieval, and Elizabethan. But those who formerly went shares generally  knew each other and something of the business too. The favorite number  of total shares was just sixteen. There were sixteen land-shares in a  Celtic household, sixteen shares in Scottish vessels not individually  owned, sixteen shares in the theatre by which Shakespeare 'made his  pile.' But sixteenths, and even hundredths, were put out of date when  speculation on the grander scale began and the area of investment grew.  The New River Company, for supplying London with water, had only a few  shares then, as it continued to have down to our own day, when they  stood at over a thousand times par. The Ulster 'Plantation' in Ireland  was more remote and appealed to more investors and on wider  grounds--sentimental grounds, both good and bad, included. The Virginia  'Plantation' was still more remote and risky and appealed to an  ever-increasing number of the speculating public. Many an investor put  money on America in much the same way as a factory hand to-day puts  money on a horse he has never seen or has never heard of otherwise than  as something out of which a lot of easy money can be made provided luck  holds good.    The modern prospectus was also in full career under Elizabeth, who  probably had a hand in concocting some of the most important specimens.  Lord Bacon wrote one describing the advantages of the Newfoundland  fisheries in terms which no promoter of the present day could better.  Every type of prospectus was tried on the investing public, some  genuine, many doubtful, others as outrageous in their impositions on  human credulity as anything produced in our own times. The  company-promoter was abroad, in London, on 'Change, and at court. What  with royal favor, social prestige, general prosperity, the new national  eagerness to find vent for surplus commodities, and, above all, the  spirit of speculation fanned into flame by the real and fabled wonders  of America, what with all this the investing public could take its  choice of 'going the limit' in a hundred different and most alluring  ways. England was surprised at her own investing wealth. The East India  Company raised eight million dollars with ease from a thousand  shareholders and paid a first dividend of 87-1/2 per cent. Spices,  pearls, and silks came pouring into London; and English goods found vent  increasingly abroad.    Vastly expanding business opportunities of course produced the spirit of  the trust--and of very much the same sort of trust that Americans think  so ultra-modern now. Monopolies granted by the Crown and the volcanic  forces of widespread speculation prevented some of the abuses of the  trust. But there were Elizabethan trusts, for all that, though many a  promising scheme fell through. The Feltmakers' Hat Trust is a case in  point. They proposed buying up all the hats in the market so as to  oblige all dealers to depend upon one central warehouse. Of course they  issued a prospectus showing how everyone concerned would benefit by this  benevolent plan.    Ben Jonson and other playwrights were quick to seize the salient  absurdities of such an advertisement. In _The Staple of News_ Jonson  proposed a News Trust to collect all the news of the world, corner it,  classify it into authentic, apocryphal, barber's gossip, and so forth,  and then sell it, for the sole benefit of the consumer, in lengths to  suit all purchasers. In _The Devil is an Ass_ he is a little more  outspoken.         We'll take in citizens, commoners, and aldermen To bear the charge,       and blow them off again like so many dead flies....    This was exactly what was at that very moment being done in the case of  the Alum Trust. All the leading characters of much more modern times  were there already; Fitzdottrell, ready to sell his estates in order to  become His Grace the Duke of Drown'dland, Gilthead, the London  moneylender who 'lives by finding fools,' and My Lady Tailbush, who  pulls the social wires at court. And so the game went on, usually with  the result explained by Shakespeare's fisherman in _Pericles_:         'I marvel how the fishes live in the sea'---'Why, as men do a-land:       the great ones eat up the little ones.'    The Newcastle coal trade grew into something very like a modern American  trust with the additional advantage of an authorized government monopoly  so long as the agreed-upon duty was paid. Then there was the Starch  Monopoly, a very profitable one because starch was a new delight which  soon enabled Elizabethan fops to wear ruffed collars big enough to make  their heads--as one irreverent satirist exclaimed--'look like John  Baptist's on a platter.'    But America? Could not America defeat the machinations of all monopolies  and other trusts? Wasn't America the land of actual gold and silver  where there was plenty of room for everyone? There soon grew up a wild  belief that you could tap America for precious metals almost as its  Indians tapped maple trees for sugar. The 'Mountains of Bright Stones'  were surely there. Peru and Mexico were nothing to these. Only find  them, and 'get-rich-quick' would be the order of the day for every true  adventurer. These mountains moved about in men's imaginations and on  prospectors' maps, always ahead of the latest pioneer, somewhere behind  the Back of Beyond. They and their glamour died hard. Even that staid  geographer of a later day, Thos. Jeffreys, added to his standard atlas  of America, in 1760, this item of information on the Far Northwest:  _Hereabouts are supposed to be the Mountains of Bright Stones mentioned  in the Map of ye Indian Ochagach._    Speculation of the wildcat kind was bad. But it was the seamy side of a  praiseworthy spirit of enterprise. Monopoly seems worse than  speculation. And so, in many ways, it was. But we must judge it by the  custom of its age. It was often unjust and generally obstructive. But it  did what neither the national government nor joint-stock companies had  yet learnt to do. Monopoly went by court favor, and its rights were  often scandalously let and sometimes sublet as well. But, on the whole,  the Queen, the court, and the country really meant business, and  monopolists had either to deliver the goods or get out. Monopolists sold  dispensations from unworkable laws, which was sometimes a good thing and  sometimes a bad. They sold licenses for indulgence in forbidden  pleasures, not often harmless. They thought out and collected all kinds  of indirect taxation and had to face all the troubles that confront the  framers of a tariff policy to-day. Most of all, however, in a  rough-and-ready way they set a sort of Civil Service going. They served  as Boards of Trade, Departments of the Interior, Customs, Inland  Revenue, and so forth. What Crown and Parliament either could not or  would not do was farmed out to monopolists. Like speculation the system  worked both ways, and frequently for evil. But, like the British  constitution, though on a lower plane, it worked.    A monopoly at home--like those which we have been considering--was  endurable because it was a working compromise that suited existing  circumstances more or less, and that could be either mended or ended as  time went on. But a general foreign monopoly--like Spain's monopoly of  America--was quite unendurable. Could Spain not only hold what she had  discovered and was exploiting but also extend her sphere of influence  over what she had not discovered? Spain said Yes. England said No. The  Spaniards looked for tribute. The English looked for trade. In  government, in religion, in business, in everything, the two great  rivals were irreconcilably opposed. Thus the lists were set; and sea-dog  battles followed.    Elizabeth was an exceedingly able woman of business and was practically  president of all the great joint-stock companies engaged in oversea  trade. Wherever a cargo could be bought or sold there went an English  ship to buy or sell it. Whenever the authorities in foreign parts tried  discrimination against English men or English goods, the English  sea-dogs growled and showed their teeth. And if the foreigners  persisted, the sea-dogs bit them.    Elizabeth was extravagant at court; but not without state motives for at  least a part of her extravagance. A brilliant court attracted the upper  classes into the orbit of the Crown while it impressed the whole country  with the sovereign's power. Courtiers favored with monopolies had to  spend their earnings when the state was threatened. And might not the  Queen's vast profusion of jewelry be turned to account at a pinch?  Elizabeth could not afford to be generous when she was young. She grew  to be stingy when she was old. But she saved the state by sound finance  as well as by arms in spite of all her pomps and vanities.

The total  circumference of the ruin is 2,286 feet, though the building itself  was only 2,000, allowing 500 to the stadia, which Herodotus assigns  as the side of its square. The elevation of the west side is 198  feet. What seems to be a castle at a distance, when examined, proves  to be a solid mass of kiln-burnt bricks, 37 feet high, and 28 broad.                     *       *       *       *       *        SPANISH LITERATURE.

CATS _(again.)_      Charles James Fox walking up Bond-street from one of the club-houses  with an illustrious personage, laid him a wager, that he would see  more cats than the prince in his walk, and that he might take which  side of the street he liked. When they got to the top, it was found  that Mr. Fox had seen thirteen cats, and the prince not one. The  royal personage asked for an explanation of this apparent miracle;  Mr. Fox said, \"Your royal highness took, of course, the shady side  of the way, as most agreeable; I knew that the sunny side would be  left for me, and cats always prefer the sunshine.\"                     *       *       *       *       *        VAUXHALL WEATHER.      It having happened for several successive summers, that wet weather  took place just as the Vauxhall season commenced, Tom Lowe, Tyers's  principal vocal performer, accidentally meeting the proprietor,  expressed an anxious desire to know when he meant to open his  gardens. \"Why are you so particular, Mr. Lowe?\" said Jonathan. \"I  have a very good reason, sir, and should like to know the very day.\"  \"Why, why?\" reiterated Tyers, impatiently. \"That I may bespeak a  great coat to sing in; for you know we shall be sure to have rain.\"                     *       *       *       *       *      LAME SINGING.
