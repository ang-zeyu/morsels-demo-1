If it was rattled she mended her pace for a block. But  if on a rare occasion my grandfather took it in his hand, Dolly lay one ear  back in our direction, for she knew then he meant business. And what an  excitement would arise in the phaeton! We held on tight for fear that she  might take it into her mild old head to run away.    But Dolly had her moments. One sunny summer afternoon while she grazed  peacefully in the orchard, with her reins wound around the whip handle--the  appropriate place on these occasions--she was evidently stung by a bee. My  brother was at the time regaling himself in a near-by blackberry thicket.  He looked up at an unusual sound. Without warning, Dolly had leaped to  action and was tearing around the orchard dragging the phaeton behind  her. She wrecked the top on a low hanging branch, then hit another tree,  severing thereby all connection between herself and the phaeton, and at  last galloped down the lane to the farm house, with the broken shafts and  harness dangling behind her. Kipling's dun \"with the mouth of a bell and  the heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-tree,\" could hardly have  shown more spirit. It was as though one brief minute of a glorious youth  had come back to her. It was a last spurting of an old flame before it sunk  to ash.    My grandfather gave his leisure to his grandchildren. He carved for us with  his knife, with an especial knack for willow whistles. He showed us the  colors that lay upon the world when we looked at it through one of the  glass pendants of the parlor chandelier. He sat by us when we played  duck-on-the-rock. He helped us with our kites and gave a superintendence to  our toys. It is true that he was superficial with tin-tags and did not know  the difference in value between a Steam Engine tag--the rarest of them  all--and a common Climax, but we forgave him as one forgives a friend who  is ignorant of Persian pottery. He employed us as gardeners and put a  bounty on weeds. We watered the lawn together, turn by turn. When I was  no more than four years old, he taught us to play casino with him--and  afterwards bezique. How he cried out if he got a royal sequence! With what  excitement he announced a double bezique! Or if one of us seemed about to  score and lacked but a single card, how intently he contended for the last  few tricks to thwart our declaration! And if we got it despite his lead  of aces, how gravely he squinted on the cards against deception, with his  glasses forward on his nose!    When he took his afternoon nap and lay upon his back on the sofa in the  sitting-room, we made paper pin-wheels to see whether his breath would  stir them. This trick having come to his notice by a sudden awakening, he  sometimes thereafter played to be asleep and snored in such a mighty gust  that the wheels spun. He was like a Dutch tempest against a windmill.    If a Dime Museum came to town we made an afternoon of it. He took us to all  the circuses and gave us our choice of side-shows. We walked up and  down before the stretches of painted canvas, balancing in our desire a  sword-swallower against an Indian Princess. Most of the fat women and all  the dwarfs that I have known came to my acquaintance when in company with  my grandfather. As a young man, it was said, he once ran away from home to  join a circus as an acrobat, having acquired the trick of leaping upon a  running horse. I fancy that his knack of throwing us to his shoulder by a  double somersault was a recollection of his early days. You may imagine  with what awe we looked on him even though he now went on crutches. He was  the epitome of adventure, the very salt of excitement. It was better having  him than a pirate in the house. When the circus had gone and life was drab,  he was our tutor in the art of turning cart-wheels and making hand-stands  against the door.    And once, when we were away from him, he walked all morning about the  garden and in his loneliness he gathered into piles the pebbles that we had  dropped.    I was too young to know my grandfather in his active days when he was  prominent in public matters. His broader abilities are known to others. But  though more than twenty years have passed since his death, I remember his  tone of voice, his walk, his way of handling a crutch, all his tricks of  speech and conduct as though he had just left the room. And I can think of  nothing more beautiful than that a useful man who has faced the world for  seventy years and has done his part, should come back in his old age to the  nursery and be the playfellow of his grandchildren.    But the best holiday was a trip to the farm.    This farm--to which in our slow trot we have been so long a time in  coming--lay for a mile on the upper land, and its grain fields and pastures  looked down into the valley. The buildings, however, were set close to the  road and fixed their interest on such occasional wagons as creaked by. A  Switzer occupied the farm, who owned, in addition to the more immediate  members of his family, a cuckoo clock whose weights hung on long cords  which by Saturday night reached almost to the floor. When I have sat at his  table, I have neglected cheese and the lesser foods, when the hour came  near, in order not to miss the cuckoo's popping out. And in the duller  spaces, when the door was shut, I have fancied it sitting in the dark and  counting the minutes to itself.    The Switzer's specialty was the making of a kind of rubber cheese which one  could learn to like in time. Of the processes of its composition, I can  remember nothing except that when it was in the great press the whey ran  from its sides, but this may be common to all cheeses. I was once given a  cup of this whey to drink and I brightened, for until it was in my mouth,  I thought it was buttermilk. Beyond was the spring-house with cans of milk  set in the cool water and with a trickling sound beneath the boards. From  the spring-house there started those mysterious cow-paths that led down  into the great gorge that cut the farm. Here were places so deep that only  a bit of the sky showed and here the stones were damp. It was a place that  seemed to lie nearer to the confusion when the world was made, and rocks  lay piled as though a first purpose had been broken off. And to follow a  cow-path, regardless of where it led, was, in those days, the essence of  hazard; though all the while from the pastures up above there came the flat  safe tinkling of the bells.    The apple orchard--where Dolly was stung by the bee--was set on a fine  breezy place at the brow of the hill with the valley in full sight. The  trees themselves were old and decayed, but they were gnarled and crotched  for easy climbing. And the apples--in particular a russet--mounted to a  delicacy. On the other side of the valley, a half mile off as a bird would  fly, were the buildings of a convent, and if you waited you might hear  the twilight bell. To this day all distant bells come to my ears with a  pleasing softness, as though they had been cast in a quieter world. Stone  arrow-heads were found in a near-by field as often as the farmer turned up  the soil in plowing. And because of this, a long finger of land that put  off to the valley, was called Indian Point. Here, with an arm for pillow,  one might lie for a long hour on a sunny morning and watch the shadows of  clouds move across the lowland. A rooster crows somewhere far off--surely  of all sounds the drowsiest. A horse in a field below lifts up its head and  neighs. The leaves practice a sleepy tune. If one has the fortune to keep  awake, here he may lie and think the thoughts that are born of sun and  wind.    And now, although it is not yet noon, hunger rages in us. The pancakes, the  syrup, the toast and the other incidents of breakfast have disappeared  the way the rabbit vanishes when the magician waves his hand. The horrid  Polyphemus did not so crave his food. And as yet there is no comforting  sniff from the kitchen. Scrubbing and other secular matters engage the  farmer's wife. There is as yet not a faintest gurgle in the kettle.    To divert ourselves, we climb three trees and fall out of one. Is twelve  o'clock never to come? Have Time and the Hour grown stagnant? We eat apples  and throw the cores at the pig to hear him grunt. Is the great round sun  stuck? Have the days of Joshua come again? We walk a rail fence. Is it not  yet noon? Shrewsbury clock itself--reputed by scholars the slowest of all  possible clocks--could not so hold off. I snag myself--but it is nothing  that shows when I sit.    Ah! At last! My grandfather is calling from the house. We run back and  find that the lunch is ready and is laid upon a table with a red oil-cloth  cover. We apply ourselves. Silence....    The journey home started about five o'clock. There was one game we always  played. Each of us, having wisely squinted at the sky, made a reckoning and  guessed where we would be when the sun set. My grandfather might say the  high bridge. I named the Sherman House. But my brother, being precise,  judged it to a fraction of a telegraph pole. Beyond a certain turn--did we  remember?--well, it would be exactly sixteen telegraph poles further on.  What an excitement there was when the sun's lower rim was already below the  horizon! We stood on our knees and looked through the little window at  the back of the phaeton. With what suspicion we regarded my grandfather's  driving! Or if Dolly lagged, did it not raise a thought that she, too, was  in the plot against us? The sun sets. We cry out the victor.    The sky flames with color. Then deadens in the east. The dusk is falling.  The roads grow dark. Where run the roads of night? While there is light,  you can see the course they keep across the country--the dust of horses'  feet--a bridge--a vagrant winding on a hill beyond. All day long they are  busy with the feet of men and women and"]]]
