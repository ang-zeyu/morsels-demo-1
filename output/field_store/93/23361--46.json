For having privily taken the measure of    Osiris' body, he caused a chest to be made exactly of the same size    with it, as beautiful as may be, and set off with all the ornaments of    art. This chest he brought into his banqueting-room; where, after it    had been much admired by all who were present, Typho, as it were in    jest, promised to give it to any one of them whose body upon trial it    might be found to fit. Upon this the whole company one after another,    go into it; but as it did not fit any of them, last of all Osiris lays    himself down in it, upon which the conspirators immediately ran    together, clapped the cover upon it, and then fastened it down on the    outside with nails, pouring likewise melted lead over it. After this    they carried it away to the river side, and conveyed it to the sea by    the Tanaitic mouth of the Nile; which, for this reason, is still held    in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and never named by them    but with proper marks of detestation. These things, say they, were    thus executed upon the 17th [Footnote: In the Egyptian calendar this    day was marked triply unlucky.] day of the month Athyr, when the sun    was in Scorpio, in the 28th year of Osiris' reign; though there are    others who tell us that he was no more than 28 years old at this time.      \"The first who knew the accident which had befallen their king were    the Pans and Satyrs who inhabited the country about Chemmis    (Panopolis); and they immediately acquainting the people with the news    gave the first occasion to the name Panic Terrors, which has ever    since been made use of to signify any sudden affright or amazement of    a multitude. As to Isis, as soon as the report reached her she    immediately cut off one of the locks of her hair, [Footnote: The hair    cut off as a sign of mourning was usually laid in the tomb of the    dead.] and put on mourning apparel upon the very spot where she then    happened to be, which accordingly from this accident has ever since    been called Koptis, or _the city of mourning_, though some are of    opinion that this word rather signifies _deprivation_. After this she    wandered everywhere about the country full of disquietude and    perplexity in search, of the chest, inquiring of every person she met    with, even, of some children whom she chanced to see, whether they    knew what was become of it. Now it happened that these children had    seen what Typho's accomplices had done with the body, and accordingly    acquainted her by what mouth of the Nile it had been conveyed into the    sea--For this reason therefore the Egyptians look upon children as    endued with a kind of faculty of divining, and in consequence of this    notion are very curious in observing the accidental prattle which they    have with one another whilst they are at play (especially if it be in    a sacred place), forming omens and presages from it--Isis, during this    interval, having been informed that Osiris, deceived by her sister    Nepthys who was in love with him, had unwittingly united with her    instead of herself, as she concluded from the melilot-garland,    [Footnote: _i.e._, a wreath of clover.] which he had left with her,    made it her business likewise to search out the child, the fruit of    this unlawful commerce (for her sister, dreading the anger of her    husband Typho, had exposed it as soon as it was born), and    accordingly, after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs    that conducted her to the place where it was, she found it and bred it    up; so that in process of time it became her constant guard and    attendant, and from hence obtained the name of Anubis, being thought    to watch and guard the gods, as dogs do mankind.      \"At length she receives more particular news of the chest, that it had    been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos,    [Footnote: Not the Byblos of Syria (Jebel) but the papyrus swamps of    the Delta.] and there gently lodged in the branches of a bush of    Tamarisk, which, in a short time, had shot up into a large and    beautiful tree, growing round the chest and enclosing it on every    side, so that it was not to be seen; and farther, that the king of the    country, amazed at its unusual size, had cut the tree down, and made    that part of the trunk wherein the chest was concealed, a pillar to    support; the roof of his house. These things, say they, being made    known to Isis in an extraordinary manner by the report of Demons, sue    immediately went to Byblos; where, setting herself down by the side of    a fountain, she refused to speak to anybody, excepting only to the    queen's women who chanced to be there; these indeed she saluted and    caressed in the kindest manner possible, plaiting their hair for them,    and transmitting into them part of that wonderfully grateful odour    which issued from her own body. This raised a great desire in the    queen their mistress to see the stranger who had this admirable    faculty of transfusing so fragrant a smell from herself into the hair    and skin of other people. She therefore sent for her to court, and,    after a further acquaintance with her, made her nurse to one of her    sons. Now the name of the king who reigned at this time at Byblos, was    Meloarthus, as that of his queen was Astarte, or, according to others,    Saosis, though some call her Nemanoun, which answers to the Greek name    Athenais.      \"Isis fed the child by giving it her finger to suck instead of the    breast; she likewise put him every night into the fire in order to    consume his mortal part, whilst transforming herself into a swallow,    she hovered round the pillar and bemoaned her sad fate. Thus continued    she to do for some time, till the queen, who stood watching her,    observing the child to be all in a flame, cryed out, and thereby    deprived him of that immortality which would otherwise have been    conferred upon him. The Goddess upon this, discovering herself,    requested that the pillar, which supported the roof, might be given    her; which she accordingly took down, and then easily cutting it open,    after she had taken, out what she wanted, she wrapped up the remainder    of the trunk in fine linnen, and pouring perfumed oil upon it,    delivered it again into the hands of the king and queen (which piece    of wood is to this day preserved in the temple of Isis, and worshipped    by the people of Byblos). When this was done, she threw herself upon    the chest, making at the same time such a loud and terrible    lamentation over it, as frightened the younger of the king's sons, who    heard her, out of his life. But the elder of them she took with, her    and set sail with the chest for Egypt; and it being now about morning,    the river Phaedrus sending forth a rough and sharp air, she in her    anger dried up its current.      \"No sooner was she arrived at a desart place, where she imagined    herself to be alone, but she presently opened the chest, and laying    her face upon her dead husband's, embraced his corpse, and wept    bitterly; but, perceiving that the little boy had silently stolen    behind her, and found out the occasion of her grief, she turned    herself about on the sudden, and in her anger gave him so fierce and    stern a look that he immediately died of the affright. Others indeed    say that his death did not happen in this manner, but, as was hinted    above, that he fell into the sea, and afterwards received the greatest    honours on account of the Goddess; for that the Maneros, [Footnote: A    son of the first Egyptian king, who died in his early youth; see    Herodotus, ii. 79.] whom the Egyptians so frequently call upon in    their banquets, is none other than this very boy. This relation is    again contradicted by such as tell us that the true name of the child    was Palaestinus, or Pelusius, and that the city of this name was built    by the Goddess in memory of him; adding farther, that the Maneros    above mentioned is thus honoured by the Egyptians at their feasts,    because he was the first who invented music. There are others, again,    who affirm that Maneros is not the name of any particular person, but    a mere customary form, and complimental manner of greeting made use of    by the Egyptians one towards another at their more solemn feasts and    banquets, meaning no more by it, than to wish, that what they were    then about might prove fortunate and happy to them, for that this is    the true import of the word. In like manner, say they, the human    skeleton, which at these times of jollity is carried about in a box,    and shewn to all the guests, is not designed, as some imagine, to    represent the particular misfortunes of Osiris, but rather to remind    them of their mortality, and thereby to excite them freely to make use    of and to enjoy the good things which are set before them, seeing they    must quickly become such as they there saw; and that this is the true    reason of introducing it at their banquets--but to proceed in the    narration.      \"Isis intending a visit to her son Orus, who was brought up at Butus,    deposited the chest in the meanwhile in a remote and unfrequented    place: Typho however, as he was one night hunting by the light of the    moon, accidentally met with it; and knowing the body which was    enclosed in it, tore it into several pieces, fourteen, in all,    dispersing them up and down, in different parts of the country--Upon    being made acquainted with this event, Isis once more sets out in    search of the scattered fragments of her husband's body, making use of    a boat made of the reed Papyrus in order the more easily to pass thro'    the lower and fenny parts of the country--For which, reason, say they,    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11281"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Zimmerman, a very grave man, used  to draw conclusions as to a man's temperament, from his _nose!_--not from  the size or form of it, but the peculiar sensibility of the organ; while  some have thought, that the temperature of the atmosphere might be  accurately ascertained by the state of its tip! and Cardan considered  _acuteness of the organ_ a sure proof of genius!--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *      WILSON THE PAINTER.      The late Mr. Christie, the auctioneer, while selling a collection of  pictures, having arrived at a _chef-d'oeuvre_ of Wilson's, was  expatiating with his usual eloquence on its merits, quite unaware that  Wilson himself had just before entered the room. \"This gentlemen, is one  of Mr. Wilson's Italian pictures; he cannot paint anything like it now.\"  \"That's a lie!\" exclaimed the irritated artist, to Mr. Christie's no small  discomposure, and to the great amusement of the company; \"he can paint  infinitely better.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SCOTCH DEGREE.      A few years since, a vain old country surgeon obtained a diploma to  practice, and called on Dr. H----, of Bath, with the important  intelligence. At dinner, the doctor asked his new brother, if the form of  diplomas ran now in the same style as at the early commencement of those  honours? \"Pray Sir, what might that form be?\" says the surgeon, \"I'll  give it to you,\" replied our Galen, when stepping to his daughter's  harpsichord, he sung the following prophecy of the Witches to _Macbeth_:        He must, he must,    He shall, he shall    Spill much more blood    And become worse,    To make his title good.      \"That, sir, was the true ancient mode of conferring a Scotch degree on Dr.  Macbeth.\"    G.J.Y.           *       *       *       *       *      THREE FACES.

This epigram is illustrated by the following conversation, which passed  between Bouvart and a French marquis, whom he had attended during a long  and severe indisposition. As he entered the chamber on a certain occasion,  he was thus addressed by his patient: \"Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I  feel quite in spirits, and think my fever has left me.\"--\"I am sure of it,  \" replied the doctor; \"the very first expression you used convinces me of  it.\"--\"Pray explain yourself.\"--\"Nothing more easy; in the first days of  your illness, when your life was in danger, I was your _dearest friend_;  as you began to get better, I was your _good Bouvart_; and now I am Mr.  Bouvart; depend upon it you are quite recovered.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LYING.
