I don't believe Tom sent this at all! Look out! Call  the police! Excited! Who's getting excited?\"    \"You are, Daddy dear!\" said Mary calmly. \"This is some mistake. Tom did  send this--I know his writing. And wasn't it Eradicate who brought this  package, Mother?\"    \"Yes, my dear. But your father is right. Let him put it in water, then  it will be safe. Oh, we'll all be blown up. Get the water!\"    \"No!\" cried Mary. \"There is some mistake. Tom wouldn't send me  dynamite. There must be a present for me in there.  Tom must have put  it in the wrong box by mistake. I'm going to open it.\"    Mary's calmness had its effect on her parents. Mr. Nestor cooled down,  as did his wife, and a closer examination of the outer box did not seem  to show that it was an infernal machine of any kind.    \"It's all a mistake, Daddy,\" Mary said. \"I'll show you.  Get me a screw  driver.\"    After some delay one was found, and Mr. Nestor himself opened the box.  When the tissue paper wrappings of the mahogany gift were revealed he  gave a sigh of relief, and when Mary undid the wrappings, and saw what  Tom had sent her, she cried:    \"Oh, how perfectly dear! Just what I wanted! I wonder how he knew? Oh,  I just love it!\" and she hugged the beautiful box in her arms.    \"Humph!\" exclaimed Mr. Nestor, a slowly gathering light of anger  showing in his eyes. \"It is a nice present, but that is a very poor  sort of joke to play, in my estimation.\"    \"Joke! What joke?\" asked Mary.    \"Putting a present in a box labeled Dynamite, and giving us such a  scare,\" went on her father.    \"Oh, Father, I'm sure he didn't mean to do it!\" Mary said, earnestly.    \"Well, maybe he didn't! He may have thought it a joke, and he may not  have! But, at any rate, it was a piece of gross carelessness on his  part, and I don't care to consider for a son-in-law a young man as  careless as that!\"    \"Oh, Daddy!\" expostulated Mary.    \"Now, now! Tut, tut!\" exclaimed Mr. Nestor. \"It isn't your fault, Mary,  but this Tom Swift must be taught a lesson. He was careless, if nothing  worse, and, for all he knew, there might have been some stray bits of  dynamite in that packing box. It won't do! It won't do! I'll write him  a letter, and give him a piece of my mind!\"    And in spite of all his wife and his daughter could say, Mr. Nestor did  write Tom a scathing letter. He accused him of either perpetrating a  joke, or of being careless, or both, and he intimated that the less he  saw of Tom at the Nestor home hereafter the better pleased he would be.    \"There! I guess that will make him wish he hadn't done it!\" exclaimed  Mr. Nestor, as he called a messenger and sent the letter to Tom's house.    Mary and her mother did not know the contents of the note, but Mary  tried to get Tom on the wire and explain.  However, she was unable to  reach him, as Tom was on the point of leaving.    The messenger, with Mr. Nestor's letter, arrived just as our hero was  receiving the late afternoon mail from the postman, and just as Tom and  Koku were getting in an automobile to leave for the depot.    \"Good-bye, Dad!\" Tom called. \"Good-bye, Mrs. Baggert!\" He thrust Mr.  Nestor's letter, unopened, together with some other mail matter, which  he took to be merely circulars, into an inner pocket, and jumped into  the car.    Tom and Koku were off on the first stage of their journey.          Chapter VII    Off for Peru      \"Well, Tom Swift, you're on time I see,\" was Mr. Job Titus' greeting,  when our hero, and Koku, the giant, alighted from a taxicab in New  York, in front of the hotel the contractor had appointed as a meeting  place.    \"Yes, I'm here.\"    \"Did you have a good trip?\"    \"Oh, all right, yes. Nothing happened to speak of, though we were  delayed by a freight wreck. Has Mr. Damon got here yet?\"    \"Not yet, Tom. But I had a message saying he was on his way. Come on up  to the rooms I have engaged. Hello, what's all the crowd here for?\"  asked the contractor in some surprise, for a throng had gathered at the  hotel entrance.    \"I expect it's Koku they're staring at,\" announced Tom, and the giant  it was who had attracted the attention. He was carrying his own big  valise, and a small steamer trunk belonging to Tom, as easily as though  they weighed nothing, the trunk being under one arm.    \"I guess they don't see men of his size outside of circuses,\" commented  the contractor. \"We can pretty nearly, though not quite match him, down  in Peru though, Tom. Some of the Indians are big fellows.\"    \"We'll get up a wrestling match between one of them and Koku,\"  suggested Tom. \"Come on!\" he called to the giant, who was surrounded by  a crowd.    Koku pushed his way through as easily as a bull might make his way  through a throng of puppies about his heels, and as Tom, Mr. Titus and  the giant were entering the hotel corridor, the chauffeur of the  taxicab called out with a laugh:    \"I say, boss, don't you think you ought to pay double rates on that  chap,\" and he nodded in the direction of the giant.    \"That's right!\" added some one in the crowd with a laugh.  \"He might  have broken the springs.\"    \"All right,\" assented Tom, good-naturedly, tossing the chauffeur a  coin. \"Here you are, have a cigar on the giant.\"    There was more laughter, and even Koku grinned, though it is doubtful  if he knew what about, for he could not understand much unless Tom  spoke to him in a sort of code they had arranged between them.    \"Sorry to have hastened your departure,\" began Mr. Titus when he and  Tom sat in the comfortable hotel rooms, while Koku stood at a window,  looking out at what to him were the marvelous wonders of the New York  streets.    \"It didn't make any difference,\" replied the young inventor. \"I was  about ready to come anyhow. I just had to hustle a little,\" and he  thought of how he had had to send Mary's present to her instead of  taking it himself. As yet he was all unaware of the commotion it had  caused.    \"Did you get the powder shipment off all right?\"    \"Yes, and it will be there almost as soon as we. Other shipments will  follow as we need them. My father will see to that.\"    \"I'm glad you hit on the right kind of powder,\" went on the contractor.  \"I guess I didn't make any mistake in coming to you, Tom.\"    \"Well, I hope not. Of course the explosive worked all right in  experimental charges with samples of the tunnel rock. It remains to be  seen what it will do under actual conditions, and in big service  charges.\"    \"Oh, I've no doubt it will work all right.\"    \"What time do we leave here?\" Tom asked.    \"At two-thirty this afternoon. We have just time to get a good dinner  and have our baggage transferred to the Chicago limited. In less than a  week we ought to be in San Francisco and aboard the steamer. I hope Mr.  Damon arrives on time.\"    \"Oh, you can generally depend on him,\" said Tom. \"I telephoned him,  just before I started from Shopton, and he said--\"    \"Bless my carpet slippers!\" cried a voice outside the hotel apartment.  \"But I can find my way all right. I know the number of the room. No!  you needn't take my bag. I can carry it my self!\"    \"There he is!\" laughed Tom, opening the door to disclose the eccentric  gentleman himself, struggling to keep possession of his valise against  the importunities of a bellboy.    \"Ah, Tom--Mr. Titus! Glad to see you!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I--I am a  little late, I fear--had an accident--wait until I get my breath,\" and  he sank, panting, into a chair.    \"Accident?\" cried Tom. \"Are you--?\"    \"Yes--my taxicab ran into another. Nobody hurt though.\"    \"But you're all out of breath,\" said Mr. Titus. \"Did you run?\"    \"No, but I walked upstairs.\"    \"What! Seven flights?\" exclaimed Tom. \"Weren't the hotel elevators  running?\"    \"Yes, but I don't like them. I'd rather walk. And I did--carried my  valise--bellboy tried to take it away from me every step--here you are,  son--it wasn't the tip I was trying to get out of,\" and he tossed the  waiting and grinning lad a quarter.    \"There, I'm better now,\" went on Mr. Damon, when Tom had given him a  glass of water. \"Bless my paper weight! The drug concern will have to  vote me an extra dividend for what I've gone through. Well, I'm here,  anyhow. How is everything?\"    \"Fine!\" cried Tom. \"We'll soon be off for Peru!\"    They talked over plans and made sure nothing had been forgotten. Their  railroad tickets had been secured by Mr. Titus so there was nothing  more to do save wait for train-time.    \"I've never been to Peru,\" Tom remarked shortly before lunch. \"What  sort of country is it?\"    \"Quite a wonderful country,\" Mr. Titus answered. \"I have been very much  interested in it since my brother and I accepted this tunnel contract.  Peru seems to have taken its name from Peru, a small river on the west  coast of Colombia, where Pizarro landed. The country, geographically,  may be divided into three sections longitudinally. The coast region is  a sandy desert, with here and there rivers flowing through fertile  valleys. The sierra region is the Andes division, about two hundred and  fifty miles in width.\"    \"Is that where we're going?\" asked Tom.    \"Yes. And beyond the Andes (which in Peru consist of great chains of  mountains, some very high, interspersed with table lands, rich plains  and valleys) there is the montana region of tropical forests, running  down to the valley of the Amazon.    \"That sounds interesting,\" commented Mr. Damon.    \"It is interesting,\" declared Mr. Titus. \"For it is from this tropical  region that your quinine comes, Mr. Damon, though you may not have to  go there to straighten out your affairs. I think you can do better  bargaining with the officials in Lima, or near there.\"    \"Are there any wild animals in Peru?\" Tom inquired.    \"Well, not many. Of course there are the llamas and alpacas, which are  the beasts of burden--almost like little camels you might say, though"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#7)"],[1,"some new kind of elephant?\" asked Harry. \"You  know Tom Swift brought back a big giant from one of his trips, and  maybe he's got a bigger elephant than any one ever saw before.\"    \"Nonsense!\" laughed Ned. \"In the first place, Tom hasn't been on any  trip, of late, except to Washington, and the only kind of elephants  there are white ones.\"    \"Really?\" asked Harry.    \"No, that was a joke,\" explained Ned. \"Anyhow, Tom hasn't any giant  elephants concealed up his sleeve, I'm sure of that.\"    \"But what could this be?\" asked Harry. \"It moved just like some big  animal.\"    \"Probably some piece of machinery Tom was having carted from one shop  to another,\" went on the young bank clerk.  \"Most likely he had it  covered with a big piece of canvas to keep off the dew, and it was that  you saw.\"    \"No, it wasn't!\" insisted Harry, but he could not give any further  details of what he had seen so that Ned could recognize it. They kept  on until they reached the hill, at the bottom of which was the Swift  home and the grounds on which the various shops were erected.    \"Here's the place where you can look down right into the yard with the  high fence around it,\" explained Harry, as he indicated the spot.    \"I can't see anything.\"    \"You have to climb up the tree,\" Harry went on. \"Here, this is the one,  and he indicated a stunted and gnarled pine, the green branches of  which would effectually screen any one who once got in it a few feet  above the ground.    \"Well, I may as well have a look,\" decided Ned. \"It can't do Tom any  harm, and it may be of some service to him. Here goes!\"    Up into the tree he scrambled, not without some difficulty, for the  branches were close together and stiff, and Ned tore his coat in the  effort. But he finally got a position where, to his surprise, he could  look down into the very enclosure from which Tom was so particular to  keep prying eyes.    \"You can see right down in it!\" Ned exclaimed.    \"I told you so,\" returned Harry. \"But do you see--it?\"    Ned looked long and carefully. It was lighter, now that they were out  of the clump of woods, and he had the advantage of having the last glow  of the sunset at his back.  Even with that it was difficult to make out  objects on the surface of the enclosed field some hundred or more feet  below.    \"Do you see anything?\" asked Harry again.    \"No, I can't say I do,\" Ned answered. \"The place seems to be deserted.\"    \"Well, there was something there,\" insisted Harry. \"Maybe you aren't  lookin' at the right place.\"    \"Have a look yourself, then,\" suggested Ned, as he got down, a task no  more to his liking than the climb upward had been.    Harry made easier work of it, being smaller and more used to climbing  trees, a luxury Ned had, perforce, denied himself since going to work  in the bank.    Harry peered about, and then, with a sigh that had in it somewhat of  disappointment, said:    \"No; there's nothing there now. But I did see something.\"    \"Are you sure?\" asked Ned.    \"Positive!\" asserted the other.    \"Well, whatever it was--some bit of machinery he was moving, I  fancy--Tom has taken it in now,\" remarked Ned.  \"Better not say  anything about this, Harry. Tom mightn't like it known.\"    \"No, I won't.\"    \"And don't come here again to look. I know you like to see strange  things, but if you'll wait I'll ask Tom, as soon as it's ready, to let  you have a closer view of whatever it was you saw. Better keep away  from this tree.\"    \"I will,\" promised the younger lad. \"But I'd like to know what it  was--if it really was a giant elephant  Say! if a fellow had a troop of  them he could have a lot of fun with 'em, couldn't he?\"    \"How?\" asked Ned, hardly conscious of what his companion was saying.    \"Why, he could dress 'em up in coats of mail, like the old knights used  to wear, and turn 'em loose against the Germans. Think of a regiment of  elephants, wearin' armor plates like a battleship, carryin' on their  backs a lot of soldiers with machine guns and chargin' against Fritz!  Cracky, that would be a sight!\"    \"I should say so!\" agreed Ned, with a laugh. \"There's nothing the  matter with your imagination, Harry, my boy!\"    \"And maybe that's what Tom's doin'!\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean maybe he is trainin' elephants to fight in the war. You know he  made an aerial warship, so why couldn't he have a lot of armor plated  elephants?\"    \"Oh, I suppose he could if he wanted to,\" admitted Ned.  \"But I guess  he isn't doing that. Don't get to going too fast in high speed, Harry,  or you may have nightmare. Well, I'm going down to see Tom.\"    \"And you won't tell him I was peekin'?\"    \"Not if you don't do it again. I'll advise him to have that tree cut  down, though. It's too good a vantage spot.\"    Harry turned and went in the direction of his home, while Ned kept on  down the hill toward the house of his chum. The young bond salesman was  thinking of many things as he tramped, along, and among them was the  information Harry had just given.    But Ned did not pay a visit to his chum that evening. When he reached  the house he found that Tom had gone out, leaving no word as to when he  would be back.    \"Oh, well, I can tell him to-morrow,\" thought Ned.    It was not, however, until two days later that Ned found the time to  visit Tom again. On this occasion, as before, he took the road through  the clump of woods where he had seen Harry running.    \"And while I'm about it,\" mused Ned, \"I may as well go on to the place  where the tree stands and make sure, by daylight, what I only partially  surmised in the evening--that Tom's place can be looked down on from  that vantage point.\"    Sauntering slowly along, for he was in no special hurry, having the  remainder of the day to himself, Ned approached the hill where the tree  stood from which Harry had said he had seen what he took to be a giant  elephant, perhaps in armor.    \"It's a good clear day,\" observed Ned, \"and fine for seeing. I wonder  if I'll be able to see anything.\"    It was necessary first to ascend the hill to a point where it overhung,  in a measure, the Swift property, though the holdings of Tom and his  father were some distance beyond the eminence. The tree from which Ned  and Harry had made their observations was on a knob of the hill, the  stunted pine standing out from among others like it.    \"Well, here goes for another torn coat,\" grimly observed Ned, as he  prepared to climb. \"But I'll be more careful.  First, though, let's see  if I can see anything without getting up.\"    He paused a little way from the pine, and peered down the hill. Nothing  could be seen of the big enclosed field back of the building about  which Tom was so careful.    \"You have to be up to see anything,\" mused Ned. \"It's up a tree for me!  Well, here goes!\"    As Ned started to work his way up among the thick, green branches, he  became aware, suddenly and somewhat to his surprise, that he was not  the only person who knew about the observation spot. For Ned saw, a  yard above his head, as he started to climb, two feet, encased in  well-made boots, standing on a limb near the trunk of the tree.    \"Oh, ho!\" mused Ned. \"Some one here before me! Where there are feet  there must be legs, and where there are legs, most likely a body. And  it isn't Harry, either! The feet are too big for that. I wonder--\"    But Ned's musings were suddenly cut short, for the person up the tree  ahead of him moved quickly and stepped on Ned's fingers, with no light  tread.    \"Ouch!\" exclaimed the young bank clerk involuntarily, and, letting go  his hold of the limb, he dropped to the ground, while there came a  startled exclamation from the screen of pine branches above him.          Chapter VIII    Detective Rad      \"Who's there?\" came the demand from the unseen person in the tree.    \"I might ask you the same thing,\" was Ned's sharp retort, as he nursed  his skinned and bruised fingers. \"What are you doing up there?\"    There was no answer, but a sound among the branches indicated that the  person up the tree was coming down. In another moment a man leaped to  the ground lightly and stood beside Ned. The lad observed that the  stranger was clean shaven, except for a small moustache which curled up  at the ends slightly.    \"For all the world like a small edition of the Kaiser's,\" Ned described  it afterward.    \"What are you doing here?\" demanded the man, and his voice had in it  the ring of authority. It was this very quality that made Ned bristle  up and \"get on his ear,\" as he said later. The young clerk did not  object to being spoken to authoritatively by those who had the right,  but from a stranger it was different.    \"I might ask you the same thing,\" retorted Ned. \"I have as much right  here as you, I fancy, and I can climb trees, too, but I don't care to  have my fingers stepped on,\" and he looked at the scarified members of  his left hand.    \"I beg your pardon. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I didn't mean to. And of  course this is a public place, in a way, and you have a right here. I  was just climbing the tree to--er--to get a fishing pole!\"    Ned had all he could do to keep from laughing. The idea of getting a  fishing pole from a gnarled and stunted pine struck him as being  altogether novel and absurd. Yet it was not time to make fun of the  man. The latter looked too serious for that.    \"Rather a good view to be had from up where you were, eh?\" asked Ned  suggestively.    \"A good view?\" exclaimed the other. \"I don't know what you mean!\"    \"Oh, then you didn't see anything,\" Ned went on. \"Perhaps it's just as  well. Are you fond of fishing?\"    \"Very. I have--But I forget, I do not know you nor you me.  Allow me to  introduce myself. I am Mr. Walter Simpson, and I am here on a visit I  just happened to walk out this way, and, seeing a small stream, thought  I should like to fish. I usually carry lines and hooks, and all I  needed was the pole. I was looking for it when"]]]
