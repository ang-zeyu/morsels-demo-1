Infinite pitch means pure translation,    And zero pitch means pure rotation.      Two motions on two given screws,          With amplitudes at pleasure,    Into a third screw-motion fuse;          Whose amplitude we measure    By parallelogram construction    (A very obvious deduction.)      Its axis cuts the nodal line          Which to both screws is normal,    And generates a form divine,          Whose name, in language formal,    Is \"surface-ruled of third degree.\"    Cylindroid is the name for me.      Rotation round a given line          Is like a force along.    If to say couple you incline,          You're clearly in the wrong;--    'Tis obvious, upon reflection,    A line is not a mere direction.      So couples with translations too          In all respects agree;    And thus there centres in the screw          A wondrous harmony    Of Kinematics and of Statics,--    The sweetest thing in mathematics.      The forces on one given screw,          With motion on a second,    In general some work will do,          Whose magnitude is reckoned    By angle, force, and what we call    The coefficient virtual.      Rotation now to force convert,          And force into rotation;    Unchanged the work, we can assert,          In spite of transformation.    And if two screws no work can claim,    Reciprocal will be their name.      Five numbers will a screw define,          A screwing motion, six;    For four will give the axial line,          One more the pitch will fix;    And hence we always can contrive    One screw reciprocal to five.      Screws--two, three, four or five, combined          (No question here of six),    Yield other screws which are confined          Within one screw complex.    Thus we obtain the clearest notion    Of freedom and constraint of motion.      In complex III., three several screws          At every point you find,    Or if you one direction choose,          One screw is to your mind;    And complexes of order III.    Their own reciprocals may be.      In IV., wherever you arrive,          You find of screws a cone,    On every line in complex V.          There is precisely one;    At each point of this complex rich,    A plane of screws have given pitch.      But time would fail me to discourse          Of Order and Degree;    Of Impulse, Energy and Force,          And Reciprocity.    All these and more, for motions small,    Have been discussed by Dr. Ball.                              _Anonymous_.

Only now and then a gentle zephyr rippled its level  which, reflected in the sunbeams, appeared like an undulating mass of  silver. The cloudless heavens, clad in their brightest hue of azure blue,  and illumined by the golden sun, painted a great variety of fine images of  light and shade on the limpid waters beneath. The sky seemed to reflect  the water and the water the sky, both gleaming in the sunshine.    On our right, the lake made the impression of stretching into endless,  unlimited space; on our left, however, we could distinguish romantic  hills, decorated by massive groves, with crossing and intersecting  promontories, and fair valleys tenanted by numerous flocks and herds, that  seemed to wander unrestrained through the rich pastures. The luxuriant  landscape was intercepted here and there by undulating slopes, covered  with sand, whose light color contrasted with the verdure of vales and  hillocks.    Speeding along, we came abreast of _Dunkirk_, a lake-port town in  Chautauqua County, N.Y., situated on a small bay in Lake Erie, forty miles  southwest of Buffalo. The town, which has a population of over 5,000,  occupies an elevated and favorable position on the lake. Its industries  comprise oil refineries, and the manufacture of flour and iron-work.    After proceeding on our voyage for some hours, we viewed--located in a  natural bay--the harbor of _Erie_, the capital of Erie County, Penn. The  port is protected by a breakwater three and one-half miles long.    The principal shipments that leave this harbor, are coal, iron, and  petroleum; an important trade being carried on with the Canadian  lake-ports.    The streets of the city are spacious and laid out with great regularity.  To its prominent buildings belong the postoffice, the opera house, the  city hospital, the court house, and the orphan asylum. Erie contains  nearly 20,000 inhabitants, many of whom are engaged in iron manufacture.  The large supply of water required for the factories is obtained from the  lake by powerful engines, which force it to a tower 200 feet high, whence  it is distributed through the mains. The chief industries developed here,  are petroleum refineries and leather factories.    It was at Erie, that Commodore Perry equipped the vessels which in 1813  defeated the British fleet on Lake Erie. In the year 1795 the town was  laid out, and in 1851 it received a city charter.    Still fascinated by the attractions of the everchanging landscape along  the southern coast, we had forgotten that _fugit hora_; for we were  greatly surprised to perceive the approaching twilight, indicating the  parting day, and the white beams of the young crescent just beginning to  steal over the lately flushed and empurpled scene.    Therefore, the \"Marguerite\" was cabled to the dock, about two miles from  the village of _Conneaut_.    A fresh and palpitating evening air invited us to a walk along the coast  of the beautiful inland-sea. Adopting an unfrequented path through a vast  plain of sand, we found the charming scenery enhanced by a solemn  stillness. All nature slumbered.    Here, witnessing a magnificent prospect in this lovely solitude, we  experienced one of those seasons when the atmosphere is so surcharged with  luxury, that every pore of the body becomes an ample gate for sensation to  flow in; and one has simply to sit still and to be filled.    Seated near the shore, we delivered ourselves up to the exquisite  loveliness around us; and when returning on board the yacht, the  impression of the superb panorama tarried with me, even into the realm of  Morpheus; so that I rose on the following morning with the remembrance of  delicious dreams.    When I came on deck, the air seemed to be sweet with perfumes; the water  sparkled brightly, and the blue sky hung cloudless over the placid mirror  of Lake Erie.    Thus, favored by the weather, the majestic steam-yacht resumed her voyage.    After the lapse of two hours the harbor of Ashtabula came in sight, and at  about 10 o'clock we approached Fair Point. The noon-tide of the summer day  was past, as we were made acquainted with the fact, that the rising towers  and pinnacles, to be discerned in the distance on our left, pertained to  the beautiful \"Forest City,\" next to Cincinnati the largest and most  important city in the State of Ohio.    _Cleveland_ is built on both sides of the Cuyahoga River, which is here  crossed by several bridges. It is located chiefly on a plain from fifty to  100 feet above the lake, of which a magnificent view is thus obtained.    Leaving East River Street, where our floating home was destined to remain,  I undertook an excursion through the greater portion of the city; not  solely for the purpose of viewing the regular streets, generally from  eighty to 100 feet wide, and lined with maple trees, but with the design  to see a friend--Miss Lina Uhl--a teacher in one of the thirty public  schools; holding a prominent position as the president of a teachers'  association in Cleveland. She is the niece of Mr. C.F. Hild, from  Schenectady, N.Y.    Having previously informed her of my intention to visit her native city, I  was already expected, and very cordially received at her hospitable home.    After I had spent some very pleasant hours there, my friend accompanied me  on my return to the dock. _En route_ she made me acquainted with many  points of interest, which are so numerous in the \"Forest City.\" Thus, she  called my attention to the charming Euclid Avenue, a street several miles  long, considered to be one of the most extensive and picturesque within  the limits of the United States. Here Cleveland's aristocracy built their  substantial mansions and luxurious villas, encircled by tasty, park-like  gardens. Of special interest to the visitor is the monument erected in  memory of James Abram Garfield, the twentieth president of the Republic,  born in Orange, Ohio, in 1831. Being in office but a short time, he was  shot by a disappointed office-seeker, Charles J. Guiteau, in 1881. This  sad event, which forms a thrilling incidence in the history of the Union,  is comparable with the recent death of Carter Harrison, mayor of Chicago,  whose assassination by Prendergast, under similar circumstances, on  Saturday, 8.30 P.M., October 28, 1893, created a profound sensation and  great excitement.    Monumental Park, near the center of the city, contains ten acres, divided  into four squares by the extension of Ontario and Superior Streets.  Besides a fountain, and other attractive objects, the park is adorned by a  statue of Commodore Perry, erected in 1860 in commemoration of his victory  on Lake Erie in 1813. It is of Italian marble, eight feet high, and stands  upon a granite pedestal twelve feet in altitude. The most noteworthy  buildings are the postoffice, the city hall, the county court house, and  the Cleveland medical college. The Union Railway depot, an immense  structure of stone near the lake shore, is one of the largest of the kind  in the United States.    Cleveland was founded in 1796, and named in honor of General Moses  Cleveland of Connecticut, who then had charge of the surveying of this  region. It was an important point in the war of 1812, incorporated as a  village in 1814, and as a city in 1836. The number of its inhabitants is  estimated to be more than 200,000. The \"Forest City\" has an extensive  trade in copper and iron ore, shipped from the Lake Superior mining  regions, as well as in coal, petroleum, wool, and lumber, received by  railroad, canal, and lake transportation. A sojourn of at least one week  is requisite in order to acquaint one's self with all the attractions of  Cleveland, with its unrivaled position and manifold beauties of scenery.    In fact, our honorable President can be proud to share his name with this  delightful place; and, in return, the \"Forest City\" may consider it an  honor to be the namesake of Grover Cleveland, the present leader of the  powerful Republic.    On Friday morning, as soon as the dawning day dispatched its first rays  over Cleveland, we resumed our voyage on Lake Erie. The flakes of light  were falling every moment faster and broader among the spires and towers  of the city of which we gradually lost sight. They were only discernible  as long, gray shadows on the elevated lake shore. The mists were couched  in quiet masses, iridescent with the morning light, upon the breasts of  the remote hills, over whose leagues of massy undulations, they melted  into the robe of material light, fading, lost in the increasing lustre,  again to reappear in the higher heavens, while their bases vanished into  the unsubstantial and mocking blue of the lake below. The dispersing  wreaths of white clouds gradually gave place to the pale azure of the  horizon. The level of the beautiful inland-sea was bathed in the glorious  sunlight and the whole heaven--one scarlet canopy--colored the limpid  waters with an exquisite, roseate tint; thus giving a redoubled splendor  to this fine panorama.    While the midday sun was sending forth his warm rays, we came abreast of  Marblehead, and speeding along we reached Green Island at 1 o'clock.    Having passed Barr Point Lighthouse we chose our halting place on the  Canadian shore near _Amherstburg_, a small village pleasantly situated on  the Detroit River.    As the yacht was fastened to the dock, the heavens were yet illumined by  the parting day; which gave us opportunity to admire the superb spectacle  on the opposite shore. Its southwestern extremity was adorned with  numerous verdant islands of various size and form; some stretching for  miles in length--the largest containing a circumference of fourteen miles;  several so small that they seemed destined for a race of fairies; others  in clusters; and some "]]]
