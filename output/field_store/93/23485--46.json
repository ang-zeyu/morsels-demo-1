Here he comes; I guess we'd better be moving.\"    General Waller, having assured himself that everything was as right as  possible, had given the last word to the private and was now making his  way toward the bomb-proof, within which were gathered his  fellow-officers and friends.    \"You had better retire from the immediate vicinity of the gun,\" said  its inventor to Tom and Ned, as he passed them. \"For, while I have  absolute confidence in my cannon, and I know that it is impossible to  burst it, the concussion may be unpleasant at such close range.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Tom. \"We are going to get in a safe place.\"    He could not refrain from contrasting the general's manner now with  what it had been at first.    As for Ned, he could not help wondering why, if the inventor had such  absolute faith in his weapon, he did not fire it himself, even at the  risk of a \"concussion.\"    How it happened was never accurately known, as the soldier declared  positively--after he came out of the hospital--that he had not pressed  the button. The theory was that the wires had become crossed, making a  short circuit, which caused the gun to go off prematurely.    But suddenly, while Tom, Ned and General Waller were still some  distance away from the bomb-proof, there was a terrific explosion. It  seemed as if the very foundations of the fortifications would be  shattered. There was a roaring in the air--a hot burst of flame, and  instantly such a vacuum was created that Tom and Ned found themselves  gasping for breath.    Dazed, shaken in every bone, with their muscles sore, they picked  themselves up from the ground, along which they had been blown with  great force in the direction of the bomb-proof. Even as Tom struggled  to his feet, intending to run to safety in fear of other explosions, he  realized what had happened.    \"What--what was it?\" cried Ned, as he, too, arose.    \"The gun burst!\" yelled Tom.    He looked to the left and saw General Waller picking himself up, his  uniform torn, and blood streaming from a cut on his face.  At the same  instant Tom was aware of the body of a man flying through the air  toward a distant grass plot, and the young inventor recognized it as  that of the soldier who had been detailed to fire the great cannon.    Almost instantaneously as everything happened, Tom was aware of  noticing several things, as though they took place in sequence.  He  looked toward where the gun had stood. It was in ruins. The young  inventor saw something, which he took to be the projectile, skimming  across the sea waves, and he had a fleeting glimpse of the greater  portion of the immense weapon itself sinking into the depths of the  ocean.    Then, coming down from a great height in the air, he saw a dark object.  It was another piece of the cannon that had been hurled skyward.    \"Look out!\" Tom yelled, instinctively, as he staggered toward the  bomb-proof, Ned following.    He saw a number of officers running out to assist General Waller, who  seemed too dazed to move. Many of them had torn uniforms, and not a few  were bleeding from their injuries. Then the air seemed filled with a  rain of small missiles--stones, dirt, gravel and pieces of metal.          CHAPTER VIII    A BIG PROBLEM      \"Are you much hurt, Ned?\"    Tom Swift bent anxiously over the prostrate form of his chum. A big  piece of the burst gun had fallen close to Ned--so close, in fact, that  Tom, who saw it as he neared the entrance to the bomb-proof, shuddered  as he raced back. But there was no sign of injury on his chum.    \"Are you much hurt, Ned?\"    The lad's eyes opened. He seemed dazed.    \"No--no, I guess not,\" he answered, slowly. \"I--I guess I'm as much  scared as hurt, Tom. It was the wind from that big piece that knocked  me down. It didn't actually hit me.\"    \"No, I should say not,\" put in Captain Badger, who had run out toward  the two lads. \"If it had hit you there wouldn't have been much of you  left to tell the tale,\" and he nodded toward the big piece of metal Tom  had seen coming down from the sky. That part of the cannon forming a  portion of the breech had buried itself deep in the earth. It had  landed close to Ned--so close that, as he said, the wind of it, as well  as the concussion, perhaps, had thrown him with enough force to send  the breath from him.    \"Glad to hear that, old man!\" exclaimed Tom, with a sigh of relief. \"If  you'd been hurt I should have blamed myself.\"    \"That would have been foolish. I took the same chance that you did,\"  answered Ned, as he arose, and limped off between the captain and Tom.    A great silence seemed to have followed the terrific report.  And now  the officers and soldiers began to recover from the stupor into which  the accident had thrown them. Sentries began pouring into the proving  grounds from other portions of the barracks, and an ambulance call was  sent in.    General Waller's comrades had hurried out to him, and were now leading  him away. He did not seem to be much hurt, though, like many others, he  had received numerous cuts and scratches from bits of stone and gravel  scattered by the explosion, as well as from small bits of metal that  were thrown in all directions.    \"Are you hurt, General?\" asked Admiral Woodburn, as he put his arm  about the shoulder of the inventor.    \"No--that is to say, I don't think so. But what happened? Did they fire  some other gun in our direction by mistake?\"    For a moment they all hesitated. Then the Admiral said, gently:    \"No, General. It was your own gun--it burst.\"    \"My gun! My gun burst?\"    \"That was it. Fortunately, no one was killed.\"    \"My gun burst! How could that happen? I drew every plan for that gun  myself. I made every allowance. I tell you it was impossible for it to  burst!\"    \"But it did burst, General,\" went on the Admiral. \"You can see for  yourself,\" and he turned around and waved his hand toward the barbette  where the gun had been mounted. All that remained of it now was part of  the temporary carriage, and a small under-portion of the muzzle. The  entire breech, with the great block, had been blown into fragments, so  powerful was the powder used. The projectile one watcher reported, had  gone about three hundred yards over the top of the barbette and then  dropped into the sea, very little of the force of the explosive having  been expended on that. A large piece of the gun had also been lost in  the water off shore.    \"My gun burst! My gun burst!\" murmured General Waller, as if unable to  comprehend it. \"My gun burst--it is impossible!\"    \"But it did,\" spoke Admiral Woodburn, softly. \"Come, you had better see  the surgeon. You may be more seriously injured than you think.\"    \"Was anyone else hurt?\" asked the inventor, listlessly. He seemed to  have lost all interest, for the time being.    \"No one seriously, as far as we can learn,\" was the answer.    \"What of the man who fired the gun?\" inquired the General.    \"He was blown high into the air,\" said Tom. \"I saw him.\"    \"But he is not injured beyond some bruises,\" put in one of the  ambulance surgeons. \"We have taken him to the hospital. He fell on a  pile of bags that had held concrete, and they saved him. It was a  miraculous escape.\"    \"I am glad of it,\" said General Waller. \"It is bad enough to feel that  I made some mistake, causing the gun to burst; but I would never cease  to reproach myself if I felt that the man who fired it was killed, or  even hurt.\"    His friends led him away, and Tom and Ned went over to look at what  remained of the great gun. Truly, the powder, expending its force in a  direction not meant for it, had done terrific havoc.  Even part of the  solid concrete bed of the barbette had been torn up.    An official inquiry was at once started, and, while it would take some  time to complete it (for the parts of the gun remaining were to be  subjected to an exhaustive test to determine the cause of the  weakness), it was found that there was some defect in the wiring and  battery that was used to fire the charge.    The soldier who was to press the button was sure he had not done so, as  he had been ordered to wait until General Waller gave the signal from  the bomb-proof. But the gun went off before its inventor reached that  place of safety. Just what had caused the premature discharge could  never be learned, as part of the firing apparatus had been blown to  atoms.    \"Well, Tom, what do you think of it?\" asked Ned, who had now fully  recovered from the shock. The two were about to leave the proving  grounds, having seen all that they cared to.    \"I don't know just what to think,\" was the answer. \"It sure was a big  explosion, and it goes to prove that, no matter how many calculations  you make, when you try a new powder in a new gun you don't know what's  going to happen, until after it has happened--and then it's too late.  It's a big problem, Ned.\"    \"Do you think you can solve it? Are you still going on with your plan  to build the biggest cannon ever made?\"    \"I sure am, Ned, though I don't know that I'll make out any better than  General Waller did. It's too bad his was a failure; but I think I see  where he made some mistakes.\"    \"Oh, you do; eh?\" suddenly exclaimed a voice, and from a nearby  parapet, where he had gone to look at one of the pieces of his gun,  stepped General Waller. \"So you think I made some mistakes, Tom Swift?  Where, pray?\"    \"In making the breech. The steel jackets were of uneven thickness,  making the strain unequal. Then, too, I do not think the powder was  sufficiently tested. It was probably of uneven strength. That is only  my opinion, sir.\"    \"Well, you are rather young to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"      European nations. Neither boys nor girls wear clothing (unless      they are the children of chiefs) until nearing the age of      puberty. Among the Wankonda, practically no covering is worn by      the men except a ring of brass wire around the stomach. The      Wankonda women are likewise almost entirely naked, but generally      cover the pudenda with a tiny bead-work apron, often a piece of      very beautiful workmanship, and exactly resembling the same      article worn by Kaffir women. A like degree of nudity prevails      among many of the Awemba, among the A-lungu, the Batumbuka, and      the Angoni. Most of the Angoni men, however, adopt the Zulu      fashion of covering the glans penis with a small wooden case or      the outer shell of a fruit. The Wa-Yao have a strong sense of      decency in matters of this kind, which is the more curious since      they are more given to obscenity in their rites, ceremonies, and      dances than any other tribe. Not only is it extremely rare to see      any Yao uncovered, but both men and women have the strongest      dislike to exposing their persons even to the inspection of a      doctor. The Atonga and many of the A-nyanga people, and all the      tribes west of Nyassa (with the exception possibly of the      A-lunda) have not the Yao regard for decency, and, although they      can seldom or ever be accused of a deliberate intention to expose      themselves, the men are relatively indifferent as to whether      their nakedness is or is not concealed, though the women are      modest and careful in this respect.\" (H.H. Johnston, _British      Central Africa_, 1897, pp. 408-419.)        In Azimba land, Central Africa, H. Crawford Angus, who has spent      many years in this part of Africa, writes: \"It has been my      experience that the more naked the people, and the more to us      obscene and shameless their manners and customs, the more moral      and strict they are in the matter of sexual intercourse.\" He      proceeds to give a description of the _chensamwali_, or      initiation ceremony of girls at puberty, a season of rejoicing      when the girl is initiated into all the secrets of marriage, amid      songs and dances referring to the act of coition. \"The whole      matter is looked upon as a matter of course, and not as a thing      to be ashamed of or to hide, and, being thus openly treated of      and no secrecy made about it, you find in this tribe that the      women are very virtuous. They know from the first all that is to      be known, and cannot see any reason for secrecy concerning      natural laws or the powers and senses that have been given them      from birth.\" (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1898, Heft 6, p.      479.)        Of the Monbuttu of Central Africa, another observer says: \"It is      surprising how a Monbuttu woman of birth can, without the aid of      dress, impress others with her dignity and modesty.\" (_British      Medical Journal_. June 14, 1890.)        \"The women at Upoto wear no clothes whatever, and came up to us      in the most unreserved manner. An interesting gradation in the      arrangement of the female costume has been observed by us: as we      ascended the Congo, the higher up the river we found ourselves,      the higher the dress reached, till it has now, at last,      culminated in absolute nudity.\" (T.H. Parke, _My Personal      Experiences in Equatorial Africa_, 1891, p. 61.)        \"There exists throughout the Congo population a marked      appreciation of the sentiment of decency and shame as applied to      private actions,\" says Mr. Herbert Ward. In explanation of the      nudity of the women at Upoto, a chief remarked to Ward that      \"concealment is food for the inquisitive.\" (_Journal of the      Anthropological Institute_, 1895, p. 293.)        In the Gold Coast and surrounding countries complete nudity is      extremely rare, except when circumstances make it desirable; on      occasion clothing is abandoned with unconcern. \"I have on several      occasions,\" says Dr. Freeman, \"seen women at Accra walk from the      beach, where they have been bathing, across the road to their      houses, where they would proceed to dry themselves, and resume      their garments; and women may not infrequently be seen bathing in      pools by the wayside, conversing quite unconstrainedly with their      male acquaintances, who are seated on the bank. The mere      unclothed body conveys to their minds no idea of indecency.      Immodesty and indelicacy of manner are practically unknown.\" He      adds that the excessive zeal of missionaries in urging their      converts to adopt European dress--which they are only too ready      to do--is much to be regretted, since the close-fitting, thin      garments are really less modest than the loose clothes they      replace, besides being much less cleanly. (R.A. Freeman, _Travels      and Life in Ashanti and Jaman_, 1898, p. 379.)        At Loango, says Pechuel-Loesche, \"the well-bred negress likes to      cover her bosom, and is sensitive to critical male eyes; if she      meets a European when without her overgarment, she instinctively,      though not without coquetry, takes the attitude of the Medicean      Venus.\" Men and women bathe separately, and hide themselves from      each other when naked. The women also exhibit shame when      discovered suckling their babies. (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_,      1878, pp. 27-31.)        The Koran (Sura XXIV) forbids showing the pudenda, as well as the      face, yet a veiled Mohammedan woman, Stern remarks, even in the      streets of Constantinople, will stand still and pull up her      clothes to scratch her private parts, and in Beyrout, he saw      Turkish prostitutes, still veiled, place themselves in the      position for coitus. (B. Stern, _Medizin, etc., in der Tuerkei_,      vol. ii, p. 162.)        \"An Englishman surprised a woman while bathing in the Euphrates;      she held her hands over her face, without troubling as to what      else the stranger might see. In Egypt, I have myself seen quite      naked young peasant girls, who hastened to see us, after covering      their faces.\" (C. Niebuhr, _Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien_,      1774, vol. i, p. 165.)        When Helfer was taken to visit the ladies in the palace of the      Imam of Muskat, at Buscheir, he found that their faces were      covered with black masks, though the rest of the body might be      clothed in a transparent sort of crape; to look at a naked face      was very painful to the ladies themselves; even a mother never      lifts the mask from the face of her daughter after the age of      twelve; that is reserved for her lord and husband. \"I observed      that the ladies looked at me with a certain confusion, and after      they had glanced into my face, lowered their eyes, ashamed. On      making inquiries, I found that my uncovered face was indecent, as      a naked person would be to us. They begged me to assume a mask,      and when a waiting-woman had bound a splendidly decorated one      round my head, they all exclaimed: 'Tahip! tahip!'--beautiful,      beautiful.\" (J.W. Helfer, _Reisen in Vorderasian und Indien_,      vol. ii, p. 12.)        In Algeria--in the provinces of Constantine, in Biskra, even      Aures,--\"among the women especially, not one is restrained by any      modesty in unfastening her girdle to any comer\" (when a search      was being made for tattoo-marks on the lower extremities). \"In      spite of the great licentiousness of the manners,\" the same      writer continues, \"the Arab and the Kabyle possess great personal      modesty, and with difficulty are persuaded to exhibit the body      nude; is it the result of real modesty, or of their inveterate      habits of active pederasty? Whatever the cause, they always hide      the sexual organs with their hands or their handkerchiefs, and      are disagreeably affected even by the slightest touch of the      doctor.\" (Batut, _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, January      15, 1893.)        \"Moslem modesty,\" remarks Wellhausen, \"was carried to great      lengths, insufficient clothing being forbidden. It was marked      even among the heathen Arabs, as among Semites and old      civilizations generally; we must not be deceived by the      occasional examples of immodesty in individual cases. The Sunna      prescribes that a man shall not uncover himself even to himself,      and shall not wash naked--from fear of God and of spirits; Job      did so, and atoned for it heavily. When in Arab antiquity      grown-up persons showed themselves naked, it was only under      extraordinary circumstances, and to attain unusual ends.... Women      when mourning uncovered not only the face and bosom, but also      tore all their garments. The messenger who brought bad news tore      his garments. A mother desiring to bring pressure to bear on her      son took off her clothes. A man to whom vengeance is forbidden      showed his despair and disapproval by uncovering his posterior      and strewing earth on his head, or by raising his garment behind      and covering his head with it. This was done also in fulfilling      natural necessities.\" (Wellhausen, _Reste Arabischen Heidentums_,      1897, pp. 173, 195-196.)        Mantegazza mentions that a Lapland woman refused even for the sum      of 150 francs to allow him to photograph her naked, though the      men placed themselves before the camera in the costume of Adam      for a much smaller sum. In the same book Mantegazza remarks that      in the eighteenth century, travelers found it extremely difficult      to persuade Samoyed women to show themselves naked. Among the      same people, he says, the newly-married wife must conceal her      face from her husband for two months after marriage, and only      then yield to his embraces.
