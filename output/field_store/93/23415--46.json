loaded, of which the  following are the most important:    (1) ~Uniform load~ occurs where the load is spread evenly over  the beam.    (2) ~Concentrated load~ occurs where the load is applied at  single point or points.    (3) ~Live~ or ~immediate load~ is one of momentary or short  duration at any one point, such as occurs in crossing a bridge.    (4) ~Dead~ or ~permanent load~ is one of constant and  indeterminate duration, as books on a shelf. In the case of a  bridge the weight of the structure itself is the dead load. All  large beams support a uniform dead load consisting of their own  weight.    The effect of dead load on a wooden beam may be two or more  times that produced by an immediate load of the same weight.  Loads greater than the elastic limit are unsafe and will  generally result in rupture if continued long enough. A beam may  be considered safe under permanent load when the deflections  diminish during equal successive periods of time. A continual  increase in deflection indicates an unsafe load which is almost  certain to rupture the beam eventually.    Variations in the humidity of the surrounding air influence the  deflection of dry wood under dead load, and increased  deflections during damp weather are cumulative and not recovered  by subsequent drying. In the case of longleaf pine, dry beams  may with safety be loaded permanently to within three-fourths of  their elastic limit as determined from ordinary static tests.  Increased moisture content, due to greater humidity of the air,  lowers the elastic limit of wood so that what was a safe load  for the dry material may become unsafe.    When a dead load not great enough to rupture a beam has been  removed, the beam tends gradually to recover its former shape,  but the recovery is not always complete. If specimens from such  a beam are tested in the ordinary testing machine it will be  found that the application of the dead load did not affect the  stiffness, ultimate strength, or elastic limit of the material.  In other words, the deflections and recoveries produced by live  loads are the same as would have been produced had not the beam  previously been subjected to a dead load.[11]    [Footnote 11: See Tiemann, Harry D.: Some results of dead load  bending tests of timber by means of a recording deflectometer.  Proc. Am. Soc. for Testing Materials. Phila. Vol. IX, 1909, pp.  534-548.]    ~Maximum load~ is the greatest load a material will support and  is usually greater than the load at rupture.    ~Safe load~ is the load considered safe for a material to  support in actual practice. It is always less than the load at  elastic limit and is usually taken as a certain proportion of  the ultimate or breaking load.    The ratio of the breaking to the safe load is called the factor  of safety. (Factor of safety = ultimate strength / safe load) In  order to make due allowance for the natural variations and  imperfections in wood and in the aggregate structure, as well as  for variations in the load, the factor of safety is usually as  high as 6 or 10, especially if the safety of human life depends  upon the structure. This means that only from one-sixth to  one-tenth of the computed strength values is considered safe to  use. If the depth of timbers exceeds four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12327"],[0,"The Jewish Manual (#8)"],[1,"quite soft, then add four  large lumps of sugar and nearly a tea-cup of vinegar; this is a very  fine stew.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF COLLOPS.    Cut thin slices off from any tender part, divide them into pieces of  the size of a wine biscuit, flatten and flour them, and lightly fry  in clarified fat, lay them in a stew-pan with good stock, season to  taste, have pickled gherkins chopped small, and add to the gravy a few  minutes before serving.           *       *       *       *       *    TO WARM COLD ROAST BEEF WHEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY DONE.    Cut it in slices, also slice some beetroot or cucumber and put them  in a saucepan with a little gravy which need not be strong, two  table-spoonsful of vinegar, one of oil, pepper, salt, a little chopped  lettuce and a few peas, simmer till the vegetables and meat are  sufficiently dressed.           *       *       *       *       *    TO HASH BEEF.    The meat should be put on the fire in a little broth or gravy, with  a little fried onion, pepper, salt, and a spoonful of ketchup, or any  other sauce at hand, let it simmer for about ten minutes, then mix in  a cup a little flour with a little of the gravy, and pour it into the  stewpan to thicken the rest; sippets of toast should be served with  hashes, a little port wine, a pinch of saffron, or a piece _chorisa_  may be considered great improvements.           *       *       *       *       *    STEAKS WITH CHESNUTS.    Take a fine thick steak, half fry it, then flour and place it in a  stewpan with a little good beef gravy, season with cayenne pepper and  salt, when it has simmered for about ten minutes, add a quarter of a  hundred good chesnuts, peeled and the inner skin scraped off, let them  stew with the steak till well done, this is a very nice dish, a little  Espagnole sauce heightens the flavor.           *       *       *       *       *    A SIMPLE STEWED STEAK.    Put a fine steak in a stewpan with a large piece of clarified suet  or fat, and a couple of onions sliced, let the steak fry for a few  minutes, turning it several times; then cover the steak with gravy,  or even water will answer the purpose, with a tea-cup full of button  onions, or a Spanish onion sliced, a little lemon peel, pepper, salt,  and a little allspice; simmer till the steak is done, when the steak  must be removed and the gravy be carefully skimmed, then add to it a  little browning and a spoonful of mushroom ketchup; the steak must  be kept on a hot stove or returned to the stewpan to warm up. If the  gravy is not thick enough, stir in a little flour.           *       *       *       *       *    BRISKET STEWED WITH ONIONS AND RAISINS.    Stew about five pounds of brisket of beef in sufficient water to  cover, season with allspice, pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and when nearly  done, add four large onions cut in pieces and half a pound of raisins  stoned, let them remain simmering till well done; and just before  serving, stir in a tea-spoonful of brown sugar and a table spoonful of  flour.           *       *       *       *       *    BRISKET STEWED.    Take about six or seven pounds of brisket of beef, place it in a  stewpan with only enough water to cover it, season with a little spice  tied in a bag; when the meat is tender and the spices sufficiently  extracted to make the gravy rich and strong, part of it must be  removed to another saucepan; have ready a variety of vegetables cut  into small shapes, such as turnips, carrots, mushrooms, cauliflowers,  or whatever may be in season; stew them gently till tender in the  gravy, the meat must then be glazed and the gravy poured in the dish,  and the vegetables arranged round.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF RAGOUT.    Take a small well cut piece of lean beef, lard it with the fat  of smoked beef, and stew it with good gravy, highly seasoned with  allspice, cloves, pepper and salt; when the meat is well done remove  it from the gravy, which skim carefully and free from every particle  of fat, and add to it a glass of port wine, the juice of a lemon, half  a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper, and a little mushroom ketchup; the  beef should be glazed when required to have an elegant appearance.    A few very small forcemeat balls must be poached in the gravy, which  must be poured over the meat, and the balls arranged round the dish;  this is a very savoury and pretty dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO SALT BEEF.    This may be done by mixing a pound of common salt, half an ounce of  saltpetre and one ounce of coarse brown sugar, and rubbing the meat  well with it, daily for a fortnight or less, according to the weather,  and the degree of salt that the meat is required to have. Or by  boiling eight ounces of salt, eight ounces of sugar, and half an ounce  of saltpetre in two quarts of water, and pouring it over the meat, and  letting it stand in it for eight or ten days.           *       *       *       *       *    SPICED BEEF.    Take a fine thick piece of brisket of beef not fat, let it lay three  days in a pickle, as above, take it out and rub in a mixture of spices  consisting of equal quantities of ground all-spice, black pepper,  cloves, ginger and nutmegs, and a little brown sugar, repeat this  daily for a week, then cover it with pounded dried sweet herbs, roll  or tie it tightly, put it into a pan with very little water, and bake  slowly for eight hours, then take it out, untie it and put a heavy  weight upon it; this it a fine relish when eaten cold.           *       *       *       *       *    SMOKED BEEF.    As there are seldom conveniences in private kitchens for smoking  meats, it will generally be the best and cheapest plan to have them  ready prepared for cooking. All kinds of meats smoked and salted,  are to be met with in great perfection at all the Hebrew butchers.    _Chorisa_, that most refined and savoury of all sausages, is to be  also procured at the same places. It is not only excellent fried in  slices with poached eggs or stewed with rice, but imparts a delicious  flavor to stews, soups, and sauces, and is one of the most useful  resources of the Jewish kitchen.           *       *       *       *       *    A WHITE FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.
