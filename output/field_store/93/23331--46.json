To mind the captive prey, be our's the care,  While you to _AEgypt_ or to _Cyprus_ steer;  There shall he go, unless his friends he'll tell,  Whose ransom-gifts will pay us full as well.\"      It may not perhaps be considered as a digression, to mention in few  words, by itself, the wonderful concordance of the writings of Moses and  Homer with the case before us: not that the former, from their divine  authority, want additional support, but because it cannot be unpleasant  to see them confirmed by a person, who, being one of the earliest  writers, and living in a very remote age, was the first that could  afford us any additional proof of the circumstances above-mentioned.  AEgypt is represented, in the first book of the sacred writings, as a  market for slaves, and, in the [027]second, as famous for the severity  of its servitude. [028]The same line, which we have already cited from  Homer, conveys to us the same ideas. It points it out as a market for  the human species, and by the epithet of \"_bitter_ AEgypt,\"  ([029]which epithet is peculiarly annexed to it on this occasion)  alludes in the strongest manner to that severity and rigour, of which  the sacred historian transmitted us the first account.    But, to return. Though AEgypt was the first market recorded for this  species of traffick; and though AEgypt, and Cyprus afterwards, were  particularly distinguished for it, in the times of the Trojan war; yet  they were not the only places, even at that period, where men were  bought and sold. The Odyssey of Homer shews that it was then practised  in many of the islands of the AEgean sea; and the Iliad, that it had  taken place among those Grecians on the continent of Europe, who had  embarked from thence on the Trojan expedition. This appears particularly  at the end of the seventh book. A fleet is described there, as having  just arrived from Lemnos, with a supply of wine for the Grecian camp.  The merchants are described also, as immediately exposing it to sale,  and as receiving in exchange, among other articles of barter, \"_a  number of slaves_.\"    It will now be sufficient to observe, that, as other states arose, and  as circumstances contributed to make them known, this custom is  discovered to have existed among them; that it travelled over all Asia;  that it spread through the Grecian and Roman world; was in use among the  barbarous nations, which overturned the Roman empire; and was practised  therefore, at the same period, throughout all Europe.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 025: me tacha pikren Aigypton kai Kypron idnai.

VII.    This _slavery_ and _commerce_, which had continued for so long  a time, and which was thus practised in Europe at so late a period as  that, which succeeded the grand revolutions in the western world, began,  as the northern nations were settled in their conquests, to decline,  and, on their full establishment, were abolished. A difference of  opinion has arisen respecting the cause of their abolition; some having  asserted, that they were the necessary consequences of the _feudal  system_; while others, superiour both in number and in argument, have  maintained that they were the natural effects of _Christianity_.  The mode of argument, which the former adopt on this occasion, is as  follows. \"The multitude of little states, which sprang up from one great  one at this AEra, occasioned infinite bickerings and matter for  contention. There was not a state or seignory, which did not want all  the hands they could muster, either to defend their own right, or to  dispute that of their neighbours. Thus every man was taken into the  service: whom they armed they must trust: and there could be no trust  but in free men. Thus the barrier between the two natures was thrown  down, and _slavery_ was no more heard of, in the _west_.\"    That this was not the _necessary_ consequence of such a situation,  is apparent. The political state of Greece, in its early history, was  the same as that of Europe, when divided, by the feudal system, into an  infinite number of small and independent kingdoms. There was the same  matter therefore for contention, and the same call for all the hands  that could be mustered: the Grecians, in short, in _heroick_, were  in the same situation in these respects as the _feudal barons_ in  the _Gothick_ times. Had this therefore been a _necessary_  effect, there had been a cessation of servitude in Greece, in those  ages, in which we have already shewn that it existed.    But with respect to _Christianity_, many and great are the  arguments, that it occasioned so desirable an event. It taught, \"that  all men were originally equal; that the Deity was no respecter of  persons, and that, as all men were to give an account of their actions  hereafter, it was necessary that they should be free.\" These doctrines  could not fail of having their proper influence on those, who first  embraced _Christianity_, from a _conviction_ of its truth; and  on those of their descendents afterwards, who, by engaging in the  _crusades_, and hazarding their lives and fortunes there, shewed,  at least, an _attachment_ to that religion. We find them  accordingly actuated by these principles: we have a positive proof, that  the _feudal system_ had no share in the honour of suppressing  slavery, but that _Christianity_ was the only cause; for the  greatest part of the _charters_ which were granted for the freedom  of slaves in those times (many of which are still extant) were granted,  \"_pro amore Dei, pro mercede animae_.\" They were founded, in short,  on religious considerations, \"that they might procure the favour of the  Deity, which they conceived themselves to have forfeited, by the  subjugation of those, whom they found to be the objects of the divine  benevolence and attention equally with themselves.\"    These considerations, which had thus their first origin in  _Christianity_, began to produce their effects, as the different  nations were converted; and procured that general liberty at last,  which, at the close of the twelfth century, was conspicuous in the west  of Europe. What a glorious and important change! Those, who would have  had otherwise no hopes, but that their miseries would be terminated by  death, were then freed from their servile condition; those, who, by the  laws of war, would have had otherwise an immediate prospect of servitude  from the hands of their imperious conquerors, were then  _exchanged_; a custom, which has happily descended to the present  day. Thus, \"a numerous class of men, who formerly had no political  existence, and were employed merely as instruments of labour, became  useful citizens, and contributed towards augmenting the force or riches  of the society, which adopted them as members;\" and thus did the greater  part of the Europeans, by their conduct on this occasion, assert not  only liberty for themselves, but for their fellow-creatures also.             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. VIII.    But if men therefore, at a time when under the influence of religion  they exercised their serious thoughts, abolished slavery, how impious  must they appear, who revived it; and what arguments will not present  themselves against their conduct![030] The Portuguese, within two  centuries after its suppression in Europe, in imitation of those  _piracies_, which we have shewn to have existed in the _uncivilized_  ages of the world, made their descents on Africa, and committing  depredations on the coast,[031] _first_ carried the wretched  inhabitants into slavery.    This practice, however trifling and partial it might appear at first,  soon became serious and general. A melancholy instance of the depravity  of human nature; as it shews, that neither the laws nor religion of any  country, however excellent the forms of each, are sufficient to bind the  consciences of some; but that there are always men, of every age,  country, and persuasion, who are ready to sacrifice their dearest  principles at the shrine of gain. Our own ancestors, together with the  Spaniards, French, and most of the maritime powers of Europe, soon  followed the _piratical_ example; and thus did the Europeans, to their  eternal infamy, renew a custom, which their _own_ ancestors had so  lately exploded, from a _conscientiousness_ of its _impiety_.    The unfortunate Africans, terrified at these repeated depredations, fled  in confusion from the coast, and sought, in the interiour parts of the  country, a retreat from the persecution of their invaders. But, alas,  they were miserably disappointed! There are few retreats, that can  escape the penetrating eye of avarice. The Europeans still pursued them;  they entered their rivers; sailed up into the heart of the country;  surprized the unfortunate Africans again; and carried them into slavery.    But this conduct, though successful at first, defeated afterwards its  own ends. It created a more general alarm, and pointed out, at the same  instant, the best method of security from future depredations. The banks  of the rivers were accordingly deserted, as the coasts had been before;  and thus were the _Christian_ invaders left without a prospect of  their prey.    In this situation however, expedients were not wanting. They now formed  to themselves the resolution of settling in the country; of securing  themselves by fortified ports; of changing their system of force into  that of pretended liberality; and of opening, by every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#8)"],[1,"off many of the  causes of wretchedness, and to heal it wherever it was found. At her  command, wherever she has been duly acknowledged, many of the evils of  life have already fled. The prisoner of war is no longer led into the  amphitheatre to become a gladiator, and to imbrue his hands in the blood  of his fellow-captive for the sport of a thoughtless multitude. The  stern priest, cruel through fanaticism and custom, no longer leads his  fellow-creature to the altar to sacrifice him to fictitious gods. The  venerable martyr, courageous through faith and the sanctity of his life,  is no longer hurried to the flames. The haggard witch, poring over her  incantations by moon-light, no longer scatters her superstitious poison  among her miserable neighbours, nor suffers for her crime.    But in whatever way Christianity may have operated towards the increase  of this energy, or towards a diminution of human misery, it has operated  in none more powerfully than by the new views and consequent duties,  which it introduced on the subject of charity, or practical benevolence  and love. Men in ancient times looked upon their talents, of whatever  description, as, their own, which they might use, or cease to use at  their discretion. But the Author of our religion was the first who  taught that, however in a legal point of view, the talent of individuals  might belong exclusively to themselves, so that no other person had a  right to demand the use of it by force, yet in the Christian  dispensation they were but the stewards of it for good; that so much was  expected from this stewardship, that it was difficult for those who were  intrusted with it to enter into his spiritual kingdom; that these had no  right to conceal their talent in a napkin, but that they were bound to  dispense a portion of it to the relief of their fellow-creatures; and  that, in proportion to the magnitude of it, they were accountable for  the extensiveness of its use. He was the first who pronounced the  misapplication of it to be a crime, and to be a crime of no ordinary  dimensions. He was the first who broke down the boundary between Jew and  Gentile, and, therefore, the first who pointed out to men the  inhabitants of other countries, for the exercise of their philanthropy  and love. Hence a distinction is to be made both in the principle and  practice of charity, as existing in ancient or in modern times. Though  the old philosophers, historians, and poets, frequently inculcated  benevolence, we have no reason to conclude from any facts they have left  us, that persons in their days did anything more than occasionally  relieve an unfortunate object, who might present himself before them, or  that, however they might deplore the existence of public evils among  them, they joined in associations for their suppression, or that they  carried their charity, as bodies of men, into other kingdoms. To  Christianity alone we are indebted for the new and sublime spectacle, of  seeing men going beyond the bounds of individual usefulness to each  other; of seeing them associate for the extirpation of private and  public misery; and of seeing them carry their charity, as a united  brotherhood, into distant lands. And in this wider field of benevolence  it would be unjust not to confess, that no country has shone with more  true lustre than our own, there being scarcely any case of acknowledged  affliction, for which some of her Christian children have not united in  an attempt to provide relief.    Among the evils corrected or subdued, either by the general influence of  Christianity on the minds of men, or by particular associations of  Christians, the African[A]. Slave Trade appears to me to have occupied  the foremost place. The abolition of it, therefore, of which it has  devolved upon me to write the history, should be accounted as one of the  greatest blessings, and as such should be one of the most copious  sources of our joy: indeed, I know of no evil, the removal of which  should excite in us a higher degree of pleasure. For, in considerations  of this kind, are we not usually influenced by circumstances? Are not  our feelings usually affected according to the situation, or the  magnitude, or the importance of these? Are they not more or less  elevated, as the evil under our contemplation has been more or less  productive of misery, or more or less productive of guilt? Are they not  more or less elevated again, as we have found it more or less  considerable in extent? Our sensations will undoubtedly be in proportion  to such circumstances, or our joy to the appreciation or mensuration of  the evil which has been removed.    [Footnote A: Slavery had been before annihilated by Christianity; I mean  in the West of Europe, at the close of the twelfth century]    To value the blessing of the abolition as we ought, or to appreciate the  joy and gratitude which we ought to feel concerning it, we must enter a  little into the circumstances of the trade. Our statement, however, of  these needs not be long: a few pages will do all that is necessary! A  glance only into such a subject as this will be sufficient to affect the  heart,--to arouse our indignation and our pity,--and to teach us the  importance of the victory obtained.    The first subject for consideration, towards enabling us to make the  estimate in question, will be that of the nature of the evil belonging  to the Slave Trade. This may be seen by examining it in three points of  view. First, as it has been proved to arise on the Continent of Africa,  in the course of reducing the inhabitants of it to slavery. Secondly, in  the course of conveying them from thence to the lands or colonies of  other nations. And, thirdly, in continuing them there as slaves.    To see it, as it has been shown, to arise in the first case, let us  suppose ourselves on the Continent just mentioned. Well then, We are  landed,--We are already upon our travels,--We have just passed through  one forest,--We are now come to a more open place, which indicates an  approach to habitation. And what object is that which first obtrudes  itself upon our sight? Who is that wretched woman whom we discover under  that noble tree, wringing her hands, and beating her breast, as if in  the agonies of despair? Three days has she been there, at intervals, to  look and to watch; and this is the fourth morning, and no tidings of her  children yet. Beneath its spreading boughs they were accustomed to play:  but, alas! the savage man-stealer interrupted their playful mirth, and  has taken them for ever from her sight.    But let us leave the cries of this unfortunate woman, and hasten into  another district. And what do we first see here? Who is he that just now  started across the narrow pathway, as if afraid of a human face? What is  that sudden rustling among the leaves? Why are those persons flying from  our approach, and hiding themselves in yon darkest thicket? Behold, as  we get into the plain, a deserted village! The rice-field has been just  trodden down around it; an aged man,--venerable by his silver  beard,--lies wounded and dying near the threshold of his hut. War,  suddenly instigated by avarice, has just visited the dwellings which we  see. The old have been butchered, because unfit for slavery, and the  young have been carried off, except such as have fallen in the conflict,  or have escaped among the woods behind us.    But let us hasten from this cruel scene, which gives rise to so many  melancholy reflections. Let us cross yon distant river, and enter into  some new domain. But are we relieved even here from afflicting  spectacles? Look at that immense crowd which appears to be gathered in a  ring. See the accused innocent in the middle! The ordeal of poisonous  water has been administered to him, as a test of his innocence or his  guilt: he begins to be sick and pale. Alas! yon mournful shriek of his  relatives confirms that the loss of his freedom is now sealed.    And whither shall we go now? the night is approaching fast. Let us find  some friendly hut, where sleep may make us forget for a while the  sorrows of the day. Behold a hospitable native ready to receive us at  his door! let us avail ourselves of his kindness. And now let its give  ourselves to repose. But why, when our eyelids are but just closed, do  we find ourselves thus suddenly awakened? What is the meaning of the  noise around us, of the trampling of people's feet, of the rustling of  the bow, the quiver, and the lance? Let us rise up and inquire. Behold!  the inhabitants are all alarmed! a wakeful woman has shown them yon  distant column of smoke and blaze. The neighbouring village is on fire:  the prince, unfaithful to the sacred duty of the protection of his  subjects, has surrounded them. He is now burning their habitations, and  seizing, as saleable booty, the fugitives from the flames.    Such then are some of the scenes that have been passing in Africa, in  consequence, of the existence of the Slave Trade; or such is the nature  of the evil, as it has shown itself in the first of the cases we have  noticed. Let us now estimate it as it has been proved to exist in the  second; or let us examine the state of the unhappy Africans reduced to  slavery in this manner, while on board the vessels, which are to convey  them across the ocean to other lands. And here I must observe at once,  that, as far as this part of the evil is concerned, I am at a loss to  describe it. Where shall I find words to express properly their sorrow,  as arising from the reflection of being parted for ever from their  friends, their relatives, and their country? Where shall I find language  to paint, in appropriate colours, the horror of mind brought on by  thoughts of their future unknown destination, of which they can augur  nothing but misery from all that they have yet seen? How shall I make  known their situation, while labouring, under painful disease, or"]]]
