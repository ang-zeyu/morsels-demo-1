We must glance at a few of the best and most typical methods of  muscular development, following the order: industrial education,  manual training, gymnastics, and play, sports, and games.    Industrial education is now imperative for every nation that would  excel in agriculture, manufacture, and trade, not only because of the  growing intensity of competition, but because of the decline of the  apprentice system and the growing intricacy of processes, requiring  only the skill needed for livelihood. Thousands of our youth of late  have been diverted from secondary schools to the monotechnic or trade  classes now established for horology, glass-work, brick-laying,  carpentry, forging, dressmaking, cooking, typesetting, bookbinding,  brewing, seamanship, work in leather, rubber, horticulture, gardening,  photography, basketry, stock-raising, typewriting, stenography and  bookkeeping, elementary commercial training for practical preparation  for clerkships, etc. In this work not only is Boston, our most  advanced city, as President Pritchett[1] has shown in detail, far  behind Berlin, but German workmen and shopmen a slowly taking the best  places even in England; and but for a high tariff, which protects our  inferiority, the competitive pressure would be still greater. In  Germany, especially, this training is far more diversified than here,  always being colored if not determined by the prevalent industry of  the region and more specialised and helped out by evening and even  Sunday classes in the school buildings, and by the still strong  apprentice system. Froebelian influence in manual training reaches  through the eight school years and is in some respects better than  ours in lower grades, but is very rarely coeducational, girls' work of  sewing, knitting, crocheting, weaving, etc., not being considered  manual training. There are now over 1,500 schools and workshops in  Germany where manual training is taught; twenty-five of these are  independent schools. The work really began in 1875 with v. Kass, and  is promoted by the great Society for Boys' Handwork. Much stress is  laid on paper and pasteboard work in lower grades, under the influence  of Kurufa of Darmstadt. Many objects for illustrating science are  made, and one course embraces the Seyner water-wheel.[2]    In France it is made more effective by the equal salaries of teachers  everywhere, thus securing better instruction in the country.  Adolescence is the golden period for acquiring the skill that comes by  practice, so essential in the struggle for survival. In general this  kind of motor education is least of all free, but subservient to the  tool, machine, process, finished product, or end in view; and to these  health and development are subordinated, so that they tend to be ever  more narrow and special. The standard here is maximal efficiency of  the capacities that earn. It may favor bad habitual attitudes,  muscular development of but one part, excessive large or small  muscles, involve too much time or effort, unhealthful conditions,  etc., but it has the great advantage of utility, which is the  mainspring of all industry. In a very few departments and places this  training has felt the influence of the arts and crafts movement and  has been faintly touched with the inspiration of beauty. While such  courses give those who follow them marked advantage over those who do  not, they are chiefly utilitarian and do little to mature or unfold  the physical powers, and may involve arrest or degeneration.    Where not one but several or many professes are taught, the case is  far better. Of all work-schools, a good farm is probably the best for  motor development. This is due to its great variety of occupations,  healthful conditions, and the incalculable phyletic reenforcement from  immemorial times. I have computed some three-score industries[3] as  the census now classifies them; that were more or less generally known  and practiced sixty years ago in a little township, which not only in  this but in other respects has many features of an ideal educational  environment for adolescent boys, combining as it does not only  physical and industrial, but civil and religious elements in wise  proportions and with pedagogic objectivity, and representing the ideal  of such a state of intelligent citizen voters as was contemplated by  the framers of our Constitution.    Contrast this life with that of a \"hand\" in a modern shoe factory, who  does all day but one of the eighty-one stages or processes from a  tanned hide to a finished shoe, or of a man in a shirt shop who is one  of thirty-nine, each of whom does as piece-work a single step  requiring great exactness, speed, and skill, and who never knows how a  whole shirt is made, and we shall see that the present beginning of a  revival of interest in muscular development comes none too early. So  liberal is muscular education of this kind that its work in somewhat  primitive form has been restored and copied many features by many  educational institutions for adolescents, of the Abbotsholme type and  grade, and several others, whose purpose is to train for primitive  conditions of colonial life. Thousands of school gardens have also  been lately developed for lower grades, which have given a new impetus  to the study of nature. Farm training at its best instills love of  country, ruralizes taste, borrows some of its ideals from Goethe's  pedagogic province, and perhaps even from Gilman's pie-shaped  communities, with villages at the center irradiating to farms in all  directions. In England, where by the law of primogeniture holdings are  large and in few hands, this training has never flourished, as it has  greatly in France, where nearly every adult male may own land and a  large proportion will come to do so. So of processes. As a student in  Germany I took a few lessons each of a bookbinder, a glassblower, a  shoemaker, a plumber, and a blacksmith, and here I have learned in a  crude way the technique of the gold-beater and old-fashioned  broom-maker, etc., none of which come amiss in the laboratory; and I  am proud that I can still mow and keep my scythe sharp, chop, plow,  milk, churn, make cheese and soap, braid a palm-leaf hat complete,  knit, spin and even \"put in a piece\" in an old-fashioned hand loom,  and weave frocking. But thus pride bows low before the pupils of our  best institutions for negroes, Indians, and juvenile delinquents,  whose training is often in more than a score of industries and who  to-day in my judgment receive the best training in the land, if judged  by the annual growth in mind, morals, health, physique, ability, and  knowledge, all taken together. Instead of seeking soft, ready-made  places near home, such education impels to the frontier, to strike out  new careers, to start at the bottom and rise by merit, beginning so  low that every change must be a rise. Wherever youth thus trained are  thrown, they land like a cat on all-fours and are armed _cap-a-pie_  for the struggle of life. Agriculture, manufacture, and commerce are  the bases of national prosperity; and on them all professions,  institutions, and even culture, are more and more dependent, while the  old ideals of mere study and brain-work are fast becoming obsolete. We  really retain only the knowledge we apply. We should get up interest  in new processes like that of a naturalist in new species. Those who  leave school at any age or stage should be best fitted to take up  their life work instead of leaving unfitted for it, aimless and  discouraged. Instead of dropping out limp and disheartened, we should  train \"struggle-for-lifeurs,\" in Daudet's phrase, and that betimes, so  that the young come back to it not too late for securing the best  benefits, after having wasted the years best fitted for it in  profitless studies or in the hard school of failure. By such methods  many of our flabby, undeveloped, anemic, easy-living city youth would  be regenerated in body and spirit. Some of the now oldest, richest,  and most famous schools of the world were at first established by  charity for poor boys who worked their way, and such institutions have  an undreamed-of future. No others so well fit for a life of  respectable and successful muscle work, and perhaps this should be  central for all at this stage. This diversity of training develops the  muscular activities rendered necessary by man's early development,  which were so largely concerned with food, shelter, clothing, making  and selling commodities necessary for life, comfort and safety. The  natural state of man is not war, hot peace; and perhaps Dawson[4] is  right in thinking that three-fourths of man's physical activities in  the past have gone into such vocations. Industry has determined the  nature and trend of muscular development; and youth, who have pets,  till the soil, build, manufacture, use tools, and master elementary  processes and skills, are most truly repeating the history of the  race. This, too, lays the best foundation for intellectual careers.  The study of pure science, as well as its higher technology, follows  rather than precedes this. In the largest sense this is the order of  nature, from fundamental and generalized to finer accessory and  specialized organs and functions; and such a sequence best weeds out  and subordinates automatisms. The age of stress in most of these kinds  of training is that of most rapid increment of muscular power, as we  have seen in the middle and later teens rather than childhood, as some  recent methods have mistakenly assumed; and this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/92"],[0,"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (#7)"],[1,"rch.  Tearfully they cast  a last look at the shattered tomb of their master, shouldered the heavy  burden of gold that would at least furnish comfort, if not happiness,  to their bereaved and beloved mistress, and made their mournful way  back across the desolate valley of Opar, and downward through the  forests beyond toward the distant bungalow.    And as they marched what sorry fate was already drawing down upon that  peaceful, happy home!    From the north came Achmet Zek, riding to the summons of his  lieutenant's letter.  With him came his horde of renegade Arabs,  outlawed marauders, these, and equally degraded blacks, garnered from  the more debased and ignorant tribes of savage cannibals through whose  countries the raider passed to and fro with perfect impunity.    Mugambi, the ebon Hercules, who had shared the dangers and vicissitudes  of his beloved Bwana, from Jungle Island, almost to the headwaters of  the Ugambi, was the first to note the bold approach of the sinister  caravan.    He it was whom Tarzan had left in charge of the warriors who remained  to guard Lady Greystoke, nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have  been found in any clime or upon any soil.  A giant in stature, a  savage, fearless warrior, the huge black possessed also soul and  judgment in proportion to his bulk and his ferocity.    Not once since his master had departed had he been beyond sight or  sound of the bungalow, except when Lady Greystoke chose to canter  across the broad plain, or relieve the monotony of her loneliness by a  brief hunting excursion.  On such occasions Mugambi, mounted upon a  wiry Arab, had ridden close at her horse's heels.    The raiders were still a long way off when the warrior's keen eyes  discovered them.  For a time he stood scrutinizing the advancing party  in silence, then he turned and ran rapidly in the direction of the  native huts which lay a few hundred yards below the bungalow.    Here he called out to the lolling warriors.  He issued orders rapidly.  In compliance with them the men seized upon their weapons and their  shields.  Some ran to call in the workers from the fields and to warn  the tenders of the flocks and herds.  The majority followed Mugambi  back toward the bungalow.    The dust of the raiders was still a long distance away.  Mugambi could  not know positively that it hid an enemy; but he had spent a lifetime  of savage life in savage Africa, and he had seen parties before come  thus unheralded.  Sometimes they had come in peace and sometimes they  had come in war--one could never tell.  It was well to be prepared.  Mugambi did not like the haste with which the strangers advanced.    The Greystoke bungalow was not well adapted for defense.  No palisade  surrounded it, for, situated as it was, in the heart of loyal Waziri,  its master had anticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any  enemy.  Heavy, wooden shutters there were to close the window apertures  against hostile arrows, and these Mugambi was engaged in lowering when  Lady Greystoke appeared upon the veranda.    \"Why, Mugambi!\" she exclaimed.  \"What has happened?  Why are you  lowering the shutters?\"    Mugambi pointed out across the plain to where a white-robed force of  mounted men was now distinctly visible.    \"Arabs,\" he explained.  \"They come for no good purpose in the absence  of the Great Bwana.\"    Beyond the neat lawn and the flowering shrubs, Jane Clayton saw the  glistening bodies of her Waziri.  The sun glanced from the tips of  their metal-shod spears, picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers  of their war bonnets, and reflected the high-lights from the glossy  skins of their broad shoulders and high cheek bones.    Jane Clayton surveyed them with unmixed feelings of pride and  affection.  What harm could befall her with such as these to protect  her?    The raiders had halted now, a hundred yards out upon the plain.  Mugambi had hastened down to join his warriors.  He advanced a few  yards before them and raising his voice hailed the strangers.  Achmet  Zek sat straight in his saddle before his henchmen.    \"Arab!\" cried Mugambi.  \"What do you here?\"    \"We come in peace,\" Achmet Zek called back.    \"Then turn and go in peace,\" replied Mugambi.  \"We do not want you  here.  There can be no peace between Arab and Waziri.\"    Mugambi, although not born in Waziri, had been adopted into the tribe,  which now contained no member more jealous of its traditions and its  prowess than he.    Achmet Zek drew to one side of his horde, speaking to his men in a low  voice.  A moment later, without warning, a ragged volley was poured  into the ranks of the Waziri.  A couple of warriors fell, the others  were for charging the attackers; but Mugambi was a cautious as well as  a brave leader.  He knew the futility of charging mounted men armed  with muskets.  He withdrew his force behind the shrubbery of the  garden.  Some he dispatched to various other parts of the grounds  surrounding the bungalow.  Half a dozen he sent to the bungalow itself  with instructions to keep their mistress within doors, and to protect  her with their lives.    Adopting the tactics of the desert fighters from which he had sprung,  Achmet Zek led his followers at a gallop in a long, thin line,  describing a great circle which drew closer and closer in toward the  defenders.    At that part of the circle closest to the Waziri, a constant fusillade  of shots was poured into the bushes behind which the black warriors had  concealed themselves.  The latter, on their part, loosed their slim  shafts at the nearest of the enemy.    The Waziri, justly famed for their archery, found no cause to blush for  their performance that day.  Time and again some swarthy horseman threw  hands above his head and toppled from his saddle, pierced by a deadly  arrow; but the contest was uneven.  The Arabs outnumbered the Waziri;  their bullets penetrated the shrubbery and found marks that the Arab  riflemen had not even seen; and then Achmet Zek circled inward a half  mile above the bungalow, tore down a section of the fence, and led his  marauders within the grounds.    Across the fields they charged at a mad run.  Not again did they pause  to lower fences, instead, they drove their wild mounts straight for  them, clearing the obstacles as lightly as winged gulls.    Mugambi saw them coming, and, calling those of his warriors who  remained, ran for the bungalow and the last stand.  Upon the veranda  Lady Greystoke stood, rifle in hand.  More than a single raider had  accounted to her steady nerves and cool aim for his outlawry; more than  a single pony raced, riderless, in the wake of the charging horde.    Mugambi pushed his mistress back into the greater security of the  interior, and with his depleted force prepared to make a last stand  against the foe.    On came the Arabs, shouting and waving their long guns above their  heads.  Past the veranda they raced, pouring a deadly fire into the  kneeling Waziri who discharged their volley of arrows from behind their  long, oval shields--shields well adapted, perhaps, to stop a hostile  arrow, or deflect a spear; but futile, quite, before the leaden  missiles of the riflemen.    From beneath the half-raised shutters of the bungalow other bowmen did  effective service in greater security, and after the first assault,  Mugambi withdrew his entire force within the building.    Again and again the Arabs charged, at last forming a stationary circle  about the little fortress, and outside the effective range of the  defenders' arrows.  From their new position they fired at will at the  windows.  One by one the Waziri fell.  Fewer and fewer were the arrows  that replied to the guns of the raiders, and at last Achmet Zek felt  safe in ordering an assault.    Firing as they ran, the bloodthirsty horde raced for the veranda.  A  dozen of them fell to the arrows of the defenders; but the majority  reached the door.  Heavy gun butts fell upon it.  The crash of  splintered wood mingled with the report of a rifle as Jane Clayton  fired through the panels upon the relentless foe.    Upon both sides of the door men fell; but at last the frail barrier  gave to the vicious assaults of the maddened attackers; it crumpled  inward and a dozen swarthy murderers leaped into the living-room.  At  the far end stood Jane Clayton surrounded by the remnant of her devoted  guardians.  The floor was covered by the bodies of those who already  had given up their lives in her defense.  In the forefront of her  protectors stood the giant Mugambi.  The Arabs raised their rifles to  pour in the last volley that would effectually end all resistance; but  Achmet Zek roared out a warning order that stayed their trigger fingers.    \"Fire not upon the woman!\" he cried.  \"Who harms her, dies.  Take the  woman alive!\"    The Arabs rushed across the room; the Waziri met them with their heavy  spears.  Swords flashed, long-barreled pistols roared out their sullen  death dooms.  Mugambi launched his spear at the nearest of the enemy  with a force that drove the heavy shaft completely through the Arab's  body, then he seized a pistol from another, and grasping it by the  barrel brained all who forced their way too near his mistress.    Emulating his example the few warriors who remained to him fought like  demons; but one by one they fell, until only Mugambi remained to defend  the life and honor of the ape-man's mate.    From across the room Achmet Zek watched the unequal struggle and urged  on his minions.  In his hands was a jeweled musket.  Slowly he raised  it to his shoulder, waiting until another move should place Mugambi at  his mercy without endangering the lives of the woman or any of his own  followers.    At last the moment came, and Achmet Zek pulled the trigger.  Without a  sound the brave Mugambi sank to the floor at the feet of Jane Clayton.    An instant later she was surrounded and disarmed.  Without a word they"]]]
