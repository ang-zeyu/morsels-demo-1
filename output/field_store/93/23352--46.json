For a while we kept  up a desultory fire, but as we could not locate the enemy (he all the  time keeping up a hot fire on our position), we became disgusted, and  lay down and kept silent. Private Marshall was here seriously wounded  while standing in plain view of the enemy, trying to point them out to  his comrades.    There were frequent calls for men to carry the wounded to the rear,  to go for ammunition, and as night came on, to go for rations and  entrenching tools. A few colored soldiers volunteered, as did some  from the Rough Riders. It then happened that two men of the Tenth were  ordered to the rear by Lieutenant Fleming, Tenth Cavalry, who was then  present with part of his troop, for the purpose of bringing either  rations or entrenching tools, and Colonel Roosevelt seeing so many men  going to the rear, shouted to them to come back, jumped up and drew  his revolver, and told the men of the Tenth that he would shoot the  first man who attempted to shirk duty by going to the rear, that he  had orders to hold that line and he would do so if he had to shoot  every man there to do it. His own men immediately informed him that  \"you won't have to shoot those men, Colonel. We know those boys.\" He  was also assured by Lieutenant Fleming, of the Tenth, that he would  have no trouble keeping them there, and some of our men shouted, in  which I joined, that \"we will stay with you, Colonel.\" Everyone who  saw the incident knew the Colonel was mistaken about our men trying to  shirk duty, but well knew that he could not admit of any heavy detail  from his command, so no one thought ill of the matter. Inasmuch as the  Colonel came to the line of the Tenth the next day and told the men of  his threat to shoot some of their members and, as he expressed it, he  had seen his mistake and found them to be far different men from what  he supposed. I thought he was sufficiently conscious of his error not  to make a so ungrateful statement about us at a time when the Nation  is about to forget our past service.    Had the Colonel desired to note the fact, he would have seen that when  orders came the next day to relieve the detachment of the Tenth from  that part of the field, he commanded just as many colored men at that  time as he commanded at any other time during the twenty-four hours  we were under his command, although colored as well as white soldiers  were going and coming all day, and they knew perfectly well where the  Tenth Cavalry was posted, and that it was on a line about four hundred  yards further from the enemy than Colonel Roosevelt's line. Still when  they obtained permission to go to the rear, they almost invariably  came back to the same position. Two men of my troop were wounded while  at the rear for water and taken to the hospital and, of course, could  not come back.    Our men always made it a rule to join the nearest command when  separated from our own, and those who had been so unfortunate as to  lose their way altogether were, both colored and white, straggling  up from the time the line was established until far into the night,  showing their determination to reach the front.    In explaining the desire of our men in going back to look for their  comrades, it should be stated that, from the contour of the ground,  the Rough Riders were so much in advance of the Tenth Cavalry that,  to reach the latter regiment from the former, one had really to go  straight to the rear and then turn sharply to the right; and further,  it is a well known fact, that in this country most persons of color  feel out of place when they are by force compelled to mingle with  white persons, especially strangers, and although we knew we were  doing our duty, and would be treated well as long as we stood to the  front and fought, unfortunately some of our men (and these were all  recruits with less than six months' service) felt so much out of place  that when the firing lulled, often showed their desire to be with  their commands. None of our older men did this. We knew perfectly well  that we could give as much assistance there as anywhere else, and that  it was our duty to remain until relieved. And we did. White soldiers  do not, as a rule, share this feeling with colored soldiers. The fact  that a white man knows how well he can make a place for himself among  colored people need not be discussed here.    I remember an incident of a recruit of my troop, with less than two  months' service, who had come up to our position during the evening of  the 1st, having been separated from the troop during the attack on San  Juan Hill. The next morning, before the firing began, having seen an  officer of the Tenth, who had been sent to Colonel Roosevelt with a  message, returning to the regiment, he signified his intention of  going back with him, saying he could thus find the regiment. I  remonstrated with him without avail and was only able to keep him from  going by informing him of the Colonel's threat of the day before.  There was no desire on the part of this soldier to shirk duty. He  simply didn't know that he should not leave any part of the firing  line without orders. Later, while lying in reserve behind the firing  line, I had to use as much persuasion to keep him from firing over the  heads of his enemies as I had to keep him with us. He remained with us  until he was shot in the shoulder and had to be sent to the rear.    I could give many other incidents of our men's devotion to duty, of  their determination to stay until the death, but what's the use?  Colonel Roosevelt has said they shirked, and the reading public will  take the Colonel at his word and go on thinking they shirked. His  statement was uncalled for and uncharitable, and considering the moral  and physical effect the advance of the Tenth Cavalry had in weakening  the forces opposed to the Colonel's regiment, both at La Guasima and  San Juan Hill, altogether ungrateful, and has done us an immeasurable  lot of harm.    And further, as to lack of qualifications for command, I will say  that when our soldiers, who can and will write history, sever their  connections with the Regular Army, and thus release themselves from  their voluntary status of military lockjaw, and tell what they saw,  those who now preach that the Negro is not fit to exercise command  over troops, and will go no further than he is led by white officers,  will see in print held up for public gaze, much to their chagrin,  tales of those Cuban battles that have never been told outside the  tent and barrack room, tales that it will not be agreeable for some  of them to hear. The public will then learn that not every troop or  company of colored soldiers who took part in the assaults on San Juan  Hill or El Caney was led or urged forward by its white officer.    It is unfortunate that we had no colored officers in that campaign,  and this thing of white officers for colored troops is exasperating,  and I join with _The Age_ in saying our motto for the future must be:  \"No officers, no soldiers.\"    PRESLEY HOLLIDAY,    Sergeant Troop B, Tenth Cavalry.    Fort Ringgold, Texas, April 22, 1899.           *       *       *       *       *    JACOB A. RIIS in _The Outlook_ gives the following interesting reading  concerning the colored troopers in an article entitled \"Roosevelt and  His Men\":    [Illustration: GENERAL NELSON A. MILES.]    \"It was one of the unexpected things in this campaign that seems  destined to set so many things right that out of it should come the  appreciation of the colored soldier as man and brother by those even  who so lately fought to keep him a chattel. It fell to the lot of  General 'Joe' Wheeler, the old Confederate warrior, to command the two  regiments of colored troops, the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry, and no one  will bear readier testimony than he to the splendid record they made.  Of their patience under the manifold hardships of roughing it in the  tropics, their helpfulness in the camp and their prowess in battle,  their uncomplaining suffering when lying wounded and helpless. Stories  enough are told to win for them fairly the real brotherhood with their  white-skinned fellows which they crave. The most touching of the many  I heard was that of a Negro trooper, who, struck by a bullet that cut  an artery in his neck, was lying helpless, in danger of bleeding to  death, when a Rough Rider came to his assistance. There was only  one thing to be done--to stop the bleeding till a surgeon came. A  tourniquet could not be applied where the wound was. The Rough Rider  put his thumb on the artery and held it there while he waited. The  fighting drifted away over the hill. He followed his comrades with  longing eyes till the last was lost to sight. His place was there,  but if he abandoned the wounded cavalryman it was to let him die.  He dropped his gun and stayed. Not until the battle was won did the  surgeon come that way, but the trooper's life was saved. He told of it  in the hospital with tears in his voice: 'He done that to me, he did;  stayed by me an hour and a half, and me only a nigger.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    GENERAL NELSON A. MILES PAYS A TRIBUTE TO THE NEGRO SOLDIERS.    Major-General Nelson A. Miles, Commander-in-Chief of the army of the  United States spoke at the Peace Jubilee at Chicago, October 11th, and  said:    \"While the chivalry of the South and the yeomanry of the North vied  with their devotion to the cause of their country and in their  pride in its flag which floated over all, it's a glorious fact that  patriotism was not confined to any one section or race for the  sacrifice, bravery and fortitude. The white race was accompanied by  the gallantry of the black as they swept over entrenched lines and  later volunteered to succor the sick, nurse the dying and bury the  dead in the hospitals and the Cuban camps.\"    \"This was grandly spoken, and we feel gratified at this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11112"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The  last nine miles of the way cost us six hours' time to conquer them; and,  indeed, we had never done it, if our good master had not several times  lent us a pair of horses out of his own coach, whereby we were enabled  to trace out the way for him.\" Afterwards, writing of his departure on  the following day from Petworth to Guildford, and thence to Windsor, he  says, \"I saw him (the prince) no more, till I found him at supper at  Windsor; for there we were overturned, (as we had been once before the  same morning,) and broke our coach; my Lord Delaware had the same fate,  and so had several others.\"--Vide Annals of Queen Anne, vol. ii.  Appendix, No. 3.    In the time of Charles, (surnamed the Proud,) Duke of Somerset, who died  in 1748, the roads in Sussex were in so bad a state, that, in order to  arrive at Guildford from Petworth, travellers were obliged to make from  the nearest point of the great road leading from Portsmouth to London.  This was a work of so much difficulty, as to occupy the whole day; and  the duke had a house at Guildford which was regularly used as a  resting-place for the night by any of his family travelling to London. A  manuscript letter from a servant of the duke, dated from London, and  addressed to another at Petworth, acquaints the latter that his grace  intended to go from London thither on a certain day, and directs that  \"the keepers and persons who knew the holes and the sloughs must come to  meet his grace with lanterns and long poles to help him on his way.\"    The late Marquess of Buckingham built an inn at Missenden, about forty  miles from London, as the state of the roads compelled him to sleep  there on the way to Stow--a journey which is at present performed  between breakfast and dinner.             *       *       *       *       *    THE GATHERER.

The  next day they came on deck, and begged to speak to the captain. \"Well,\"  said the captain, \"what have you got to say?\"--\"Please your honour, you  were all drunk yesterday, all except we three; will your honour be  pleased to allow us to get drunk to-day?\" Sir Joseph, who was standing  by, was so tickled with the oddity of the request, that he begged they  might be indulged, and that he would subscribe two bottles of rum and  two bottles of brandy. The boon was granted, and in less than three  hours, these messmates balanced accounts, being as drunk as their hearts  could wish.--_Mr Wadd._             *       *       *       *       *    MADEMOISELLE MARS.      Some time after Napoleon's return to Paris, in 1815, as he was passing  the troops in review at the Place Carousel, he happened to see the  celebrated Mademoiselle Mars, stationed among the troops, in order to  view the imposing military spectacle. The emperor, approaching the spot,  and addressing her, said, \"What do you do here, Mademoiselle? this is no  place for you.\"--\"Sire,\" answered the witty and animated daughter of  Thalia, \"I come to behold a real hero; I am tired of seeing mock ones  upon the stage.\"    INA.             *       *       *       *       *      Some years ago the following inscription, engraved on the fragment of a  stone, was discovered amongst the relics of an antiquarian, and was  considered by him as a great curiosity, and enhanced in value by its  translation having puzzled the best scholars of the age:--                  BENE.

Captain John Graunt, in his Observations on the Bills of Mortality,  says, that of 229,250 persons, who died in twenty years, only _two_ are  put to the account of _excessive drinking_. But, perhaps, if the matter  were truly stated, a great many of the dropsies, apoplexies, and palsies  ought to have been placed under that head. It is not impossible that  those who had the charge of rendering these accounts, might have  entertained the opinion of old Dick Baldwyn, who stoutly maintained that  no man ever died of drinking. \"Some puny things,\" said he, \"have died  learning to drink, but no man ever died of drinking!\" Now, this was no  mean authority; for he spoke from great practical experience, and was  moreover many years treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.--_Mr.  Wadd--in Brande's Journal._             *       *       *       *       *    The \"Sunday Times\" of the 28th ult. has the following paragraph  inserted:--      _Typographical Errors._    The New Times speaks (some time ago) of a \"Party given by the Duke of  _Pork_!\" Another paper, of \"Proceedings in the Court of Common  _Fleas_!\" and the _Morning Chronicle_ of Tuesday last speaks of \"an  atrocious _Bobbery_!\" The cream of this criticism on others is, that the  very same paper has the following paragraph:--\"_Fleet Prison, Dec.  26th._ Died last night, about 12 o'clock, the Rev.
