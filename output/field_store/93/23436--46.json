In the year 1755 the  amount of all exports did not reach 2,500,000 francs, while the imports  were valued at 8,000,000 francs. These imports represented wines,  brandies, hardware and various luxuries, but the bulk was made up of the  supplies required for the use of the military and civil authorities.  The whole trade of the country was carried in about thirty sea-going  vessels, none of them of heavy tonnage. The royal government attempted  to stimulate ship-building in the country, and a few war vessels were  actually built in the course of many years, though it does not appear  that this industry was ever conducted with energy or enterprise. During  the last fifty years of French rule, in all probability, not a hundred  sea-going vessels were launched in the valley of the St. Lawrence.  Duties of import, before 1748, were only imposed on wines, brandies, and  Brazilian tobacco; but after the commencement of the war with England,  the king found it necessary to establish export and import duties: a  special exception was however made in favour of the produce of the farm,  forest and sea, which were allowed to enter or go out free. The whole  amount of duties raised in ordinary years did not reach above 300,000  francs.    In the closing years of French dominion the total population of Quebec,  Montreal and Three Rivers, the only towns in the province, did not  exceed 13,000 souls--about the population of Boston. Quebec alone had  8000 inhabitants, Montreal 4000, and Three Rivers 1000. The architecture  of these places was more remarkable for solidity than elegance or  symmetry of proportions. The churches, religious and educational  establishments, official buildings and residences--notably the  intendant's palace at Quebec--were built of stone. The most pretentious  edifice was the chateau of St. Louis--the residence of the  governor-general--which was rebuilt by Count de Frontenac within the  limits of the fort of St. Louis, first erected by Champlain on the  historic height always associated with his name. The best buildings in  the towns were generally of one story and constructed of stone. In the  rural parishes, the villages, properly speaking, consisted of a church,  presbytery, school, and tradesmen's houses, while the farms of the  _habitants_ stretched on either side. The size and shape of the farms  were governed by the form of the seigniories throughout the province. M.  Bourdon, the first Canadian surveyor-general, originally mapped out the  seigniories in oblong shapes with very narrow frontage along the  river--a frontage of two or three _arpents_ against a depth of from  forty to eighty _arpents_--and the same inconvenient oblong plan was  followed in making sub-grants to the _censitaire_ or _habitant_. The  result was a disfigurement of a large portion of the country, as the  civil law governing the succession of estates gradually cut up all the  seigniories into a number of small farms, each in the form of the  parallelogram originally given to the seigniorial grants. The houses of  the _habitants_, then as now, were generally built of logs or sawn  lumber, all whitewashed, with thatched or wooden roofs projecting over  the front so as to form a sort of porch or verandah. The farm-houses  were generally close together, especially in the best cultivated and  most thickly settled districts between Quebec and Montreal. Travellers,  just before the Seven Years' War, tell us that the farms in that  district appeared to be well cultivated on the whole, and the homes of  the _habitants_ gave evidences of thrift and comfort. Some farmers had  orchards from which cider was made, and patches of the coarse strong  tobacco which they continue to use to this day, and which is now an  important product of their province. Until the war the condition of the  French Canadian _habitant_ was one of rude comfort. He could never  become rich, in a country where there was no enterprise or trade which  encouraged him to strenuous efforts to make and save money. Gold and  silver were to him curiosities, and paper promises to pay, paper or card  money, were widely circulated from early times, and were never for the  most part redeemed, though the British authorities after the peace of  1763 made every possible effort to induce the French government to  discharge its obligations to the French Canadian people. The life of the  _habitants_ in peaceful times was far easier and happier than that of  the peasants of old France. They had few direct taxes to bear, except  the tithes required for the support of the church and such small  contributions as were necessary for local purposes. They were, however,  liable to be called out at any moment for military duties and were  subject to _corvees_ or forced labour for which they were never paid by  the authorities.    The outbreak of the Seven Years' War was a serious blow to a people who  had at last surmounted the greatest difficulties of pioneer life, and  attained a moderate degree of comfort. The demands upon the people  capable of bearing arms were necessarily fatal to steady farming  occupations; indeed, in the towns of Quebec and Montreal there was more  than once an insufficiency of food for the garrisons, and horse-flesh  had to be served out, to the great disgust of the soldiers who at first  refused to take it. Had it not been for the opportune arrival of a ship  laden with provisions in the spring of 1759, the government would have  been unable to feed the army or the inhabitants of Quebec. The gravity  of the situation was aggravated for years by the jobbery and corruption  of the men who had the fate of the country largely in their hands. A few  French merchants, and monopolists in league with corrupt officials,  controlled the markets and robbed a long-suffering and too patient  people. The names of Bigot, Pean, and other officials of the last years  of French administration, are justly execrated by French Canadians as  robbers of the state and people in the days when the country was on the  verge of war, and Montcalm, a brave, incorruptible man, was fighting  against tremendous odds to save this unfortunate country to which he  gave up his own life in vain.    So long as France governed Canada, education was entirely in the hands  of the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuits, Franciscans, and other  religious orders, male and female, at an early date, commenced the  establishment of those colleges and seminaries which have always had so  important a share in the education of Lower Canada. The Jesuits founded  a college at Quebec in 1635, or three years before the establishment of  Harvard, and the Ursulines opened their convent in the same city four  years later. Sister Bourgeoys of Troyes founded at Montreal in 1659 the  Congregation de Notre-Dame for the education of girls of humble rank;  the commencement of an institution which has now its buildings in many  parts of Canada. In the latter part of the seventeenth century Bishop  Laval carried out a project for providing education for Canadian priests  drawn from the people of the country. Consequently, in addition to the  great seminary at Quebec, there was the lesser seminary where boys were  taught in the hope that they would take orders. In the inception of  education the French endeavoured in more than one of their institutions  to combine industrial pursuits with the ordinary branches of an  elementary education. But all accounts of the days of the French regime  go to show that, despite the zealous efforts of the religious bodies to  improve the education of the colonists, secular instruction was at a  very low ebb and hardly reached the seigniories. One writer tells us  that \"even the children of officers and gentlemen scarcely knew how to  read and write; they were ignorant of the first elements of geography  and history.\" Still, dull and devoid of intellectual life as was the  life of the Canadian, he had his place of worship where he received a  moral training which elevated him immeasurably above the peasantry of  England as well as of his old home. The clergy of Lower Canada  confessedly did their best to relieve the ignorance of the people, but  they were naturally unable to accomplish, by themselves, a task which  properly devolved on the governing class. Under the French regime in  Canada the civil authorities were as little anxious to enlighten the  people by the establishment of public or common schools as they were to  give them a voice in the government of the country.    Evidence of some culture and intellectual aspirations in social circles  of the ancient capital attracted the surprise of travellers who visited  the country before the close of the French dominion. \"Science and the  fine arts,\" wrote Charlevoix, in 1744, \"have their turn and conversation  does not fail. The Canadians breathe from their birth an air of liberty,  which makes them very pleasant in the intercourse of life, and our  language is nowhere more purely spoken.\" La Gallissoniere, a highly  cultured governor, spared no effort to encourage a sympathetic study of  scientific pursuits. Dr. Michel Sarrasin, who was a practising physician  in Quebec for nearly half a century, devoted himself most assiduously to  the natural history of the colony, and made some valuable contributions  to the French Academy. The Swedish botanist, Peter Kalm, was impressed  with the liking for scientific study which he observed in the French  colony. But such intellectual culture, as Kalm and Charlevoix mentioned,  never showed itself beyond the walls of Quebec or Montreal. The  province, as a whole, was in a state of mental sluggishness at the time  of the conquest by England, under whose benign influence the French  Canadian people were now to enter on a new career of political and  intellectual development.    Pitt and Wolfe must take a high"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12667"],[0,"Travels of Richard and John Lander into the interior of Africa, for the (#8)"],[1,"to Buckar Sano, the chief merchant on the  Gambia, who soon after arrived with a stock of provisions, which he  disposed of at reasonable prices. In return for the promptitude, with  which Buckar Sano had replied to his message, Jobson treated him with  the greatest hospitality, placing before him the brandy bottle as the  most important object of the entertainment. Buckar Sano seemed by no  means unwilling to consider it in that character, for he paid so many  visitations to it that he became so intoxicated, that he lay during  the whole of the night dead drunk in the boat. Buckar Sano, however,  showed by his subsequent conduct, that drunkenness was not a vice, to  which he was naturally addicted, and that the strength of the spirit  had crept upon him, before he was aware of the consequences that were  likely to ensue. On any subsequent occasion, when the brandy bottle  was tendered to him, he would take a glass, but on being pressed to  repeat it, he would shake his head with apparent tokens of disgust;  after the exchange of some presents, and many ridiculous ceremonies,  Buckar Sano was proclaimed the white man's alchade, or mercantile  agent. Jobson had, however, some reason to doubt his good faith, from  the accounts which he gave of a city four months journey in the  interior, the roofs of the houses of which were covered with sheets  of gold. It must, however, be considered, in exculpation of the  supposed exaggerated accounts of Buckar Sano, that the Europeans at  that time possessed a very circumscribed knowledge of the extent of  the interior of Africa, and that a four months journey, to a  particular city, would not be looked upon at the time as  transgressing the bounds of truth. It is most probable that Buckar  Sano alluded to Timbuctoo, a place that has given rise to more  extraordinary conjectures, and respecting which, more fabulous  stories have been told than of Babylon, or of Carthage of ancient  history.    The circumstance of a vessel having arrived in the river for the  purpose of traffic, caused a strong sensation throughout the country,  and the natives flocked from all the neighbouring districts, anxious  not only to obtain a sight of the white men, but to commence their  commercial dealings. They erected their huts on the banks of the  river, which in a short time resembled a village, and for the first  time, the busy hum of trade was heard in the interior of Africa. The  natives, with whom Jobson commenced his commercial dealings, appeared  to possess some traces of civilization, nor were they deficient in  many of the arts, which are known amongst the civilized nations, and  which, even at that time, were with them but in their infancy.    To these people, however, succeeded a different race of visitors,  far more rude and uncivilized, whose bodies were covered with skins  of wild animals, the tails hanging as from the beasts. The men of  this race had never seen a white man before, and so great was their  fear, when Jobson presented himself amongst them, that they all ran  away, and stationed themselves at some distance from the river. They  were, however, soon tempted back again, at the sight of a few beads,  and the most friendly relations were afterwards established between  them.    Jobson found that in Tenda, as elsewhere, salt was the article  chiefly in demand, but he had unfortunately omitted to provide  himself with any great quantity of that article. Iron wares met with  a ready sale, though these were supplied at a cheaper rate by a  neighbouring people. The sword-blade of Buckar Sano, and the brass  bracelets of his wife, appeared to Jobson to be specimens of as good  workmanship as could be seen in England. Jobson, from very  prudential motives, abstained from mentioning gold; but Buckar Sano,  who knew perhaps what Europeans most coveted, told him, that if he  continued to trade with Tenda, he could dispose of all his cargoes  for gold. The negro merchant affirmed, that he had been four times at  a town in which the houses were all covered with gold, and distant a  journey of four moons. Jobson was informed that six days journey from  St. John's Mart, the name which he gave to the factory at Tenda, was  a town called Mombar, where there was much trade for gold. Three  stages farther was Jaye, whence the gold came. Some of the native  merchants, finding that Jobson had not any salt with him, refused to  enter into any commercial dealings with him, and returned highly  dissatisfied. For the commodities which he did dispose of, he  obtained, in exchange, gold and ivory; he could have obtained hides  in abundance, but they were too bulky a commodity to bear the expense  of conveyance.    Jobson wisely adapted his carriage to the negro customs; he danced  and sung with the natives, and entered with a proper spirit into all  their entertainments. He remarks, that the water of the Gambia above  Barraconda has such a strong scent of musk, from the multitude of  crocodiles, that infest that part of the river, as to be unfit for  use. The torpedo also abounds in the river about Cassan, and at first  caused not a little terror and amazement to the crew.    Amongst other acts of kindness, which Buckar Sano showed to the  Englishman, he offered to introduce him at the court of Tenda. This,  in a commercial point of view, was an advantage not to be overlooked,  independently of the knowledge, which he would acquire of the  internal geography of the country. On reaching the king's presence,  an example was witnessed of the debasing homage, which is usually  paid to negro princes, and of which some striking examples will be  given in the journey of Clapperton. The great and wealthy merchant,  on appearing in the presence of the king, first fell on his knees,  and then throwing off his shirt, extended himself naked and flat on  the ground, whilst his attendants almost buried him beneath dust and  mud; after grovelling like a beast for some time in this position, he  suddenly started up, shook off the mud from him, in which operation  he was assisted by two of his wives, who then assisted him in  equipping himself in his best attire, with his bow and quiver, and  all the other paraphernalia of a person of rank and consequence. He  and his attendants, after having made a semblance of shooting at  Jobson, laid their bows at his feet, which was understood to be a  token of homage. The king even assured the English captain, that the  country, and every thing in it, were then placed at his disposal,  \"which bounty, observes Jobson, could require no less than two or  three bottles of my best brandy, although the English were not  sixpence the better for the grant.\"    The dry season had now commenced, and Jobson observed that the waters  of the river were gradually sinking lower and lower; but the city,  the roofs of which were plates of gold, haunted the busy fancy of  Jobson, and he used every endeavour to ascend the river, in order  that he might discover the sources from which the plates of gold were  made. It was evident to him, that Buckar Sano had either practised an  imposition upon him, or that he had grossly exaggerated the treasures  of the wonderful city; but in regard to the former, he could not  divine any motive by which Buckar Sano could be actuated in imposing  upon him; and in regard to the latter, making every allowance for  exaggeration, it might eventually transpire, that the country  abounded with the precious metal, although perhaps not exactly in the  extraordinary degree as reported by Buckar Sano. After encountering  many difficulties, he was obliged to relinquish the farther ascent of  the river, nor did he even reach the point where the previous  discoveries of Thompson terminated, which may be considered as the  utmost boundary of the discoveries of that period; indeed many years  elapsed before any travellers passed the limits at which Thompson or  Jobson had arrived. The latter gives a strange report, which,  however, was in some degree partially circulated before him, of a  silent traffic being carried on in the interior between the moors and  a negro nation, who would not allow themselves to be seen. \"The  reason,\" he adds, \"why these negroes conceal themselves, is, that  they have lips of an unnatural size, hanging down halfway over their  breasts, and which they are obliged to rub with salt continually, to  keep them from putrefaction.\" Thus even the great salt trade of the  interior of Africa is not wholly untinged with fable.    The stream became at last so shallow, that Jobson could not ascend  any farther, and he began his voyage downwards on the 10th February,  intending to return at the season when the periodical rains filled  the channel. He was, however, never able to execute this purpose, as  he and the company became involved in a quarrel with the merchants,  whom he visits with his highest displeasure, representing them as  persons alive only to their own immediate interests, and utterly  regardless of any of those honourable motives with which all  commercial dealings ought to be characterised.    Jobson may be said to have been the first Englishman, who enjoyed the  opportunity of observing the manners and superstitions peculiar to  the interior of Africa, but that must be taken as only within the  narrow limits to which the discoveries at that period extended. He  found that the chiefs of the different nations were attended by bands  of musicians, to whom he gives the appellation of juddies or  fiddlers, and compares them to the Irish rhymsters, or, as we should  now compare them, to the Italian improvisatori. By some other authors  they are called jelle, or jillemen; the instruments on which they  perform being rudely made of wood, having a sonorous sound, on  account of its extreme hardness, and in some instances they exhibit  the knowledge of the power of an extended string, by fastening a  piece of the gut of an animal across a"]]]
