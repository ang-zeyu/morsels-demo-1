At last  the guess was made that possibly the piston was a trifle small for  the cylinder; a new and slightly larger piston was put in and the  noise ceased. It so happened that the expert had heard of one  other such case, therefore he made the experiment of trying a  fractionally larger piston as a last resort; imagine the  predicament of the amateur, or the mechanic who had never heard of  such a trouble.    There is, of course, a dull thud at each explosion; this is the  natural \"kick\" of the engine, and is very perceptible on large  single-cylinder motors; but this dull thud is very different from  the hammer-like knock resulting from lost motion between the  parts, and the practised ear will detect the difference at once.    The best way to find the pounding is to throw a stream of heavy  lubricating oil on the bearings, one by one, until the noise is  silenced for the moment. Even the piston can be reached with a  flood of oil and tested.    It is not easy to tell by feeling whether a bearing on a gasoline  motor is too free. The heat developed is so great that bearings  are left with considerable play.    A leak in the water-tank or coils is annoying; but if facilities  for permanent repair are lacking, a pint of bran or middlings from  any farmer's barn, put in the water, will close the leak nine  times out of ten.    From Norwalk through Wakeman and Kipton to Oberlin the road is  rather poor, with but two or three redeeming stretches near  Kipton. It is mostly clay, and in dry weather is hard and dusty  and rough from much traffic.    Leading into Oberlin the road is covered with great broad  flag-stones, which once upon a time must have presented a smooth  hard surface, but now make a succession of disagreeable bumps.    Out of Elyria we made the mistake of leaving the trolley line, and  for miles had to go through sand, which greatly lessened our  speed, but towards Stony River the road was perfect, and we made  the best time of the day.    It required some time in Cleveland to remove and repair the  water-tank, cut a link out of the chain, take up the lost motion in  the steering-wheel, and tighten up things generally. It was four  o'clock before we were off for Painesville.    Euclid Avenue is well paved in the city, but just outside there is  a bit of old plank road that is disgracefully bad. Through  Wickliff, Willoughby, and Mentor the road is a smooth, hard  gravel.    Arriving at Painesville a few minutes after seven, we took in  gasoline, had supper, and prepared to start for Ashtabula.    It was dark, so we could not see the tires; but just before  starting I gave each a sharp blow with a wrench to see if it was  hard,--a sharp blow, or even a kick, tells the story much better  than feeling of the tires.    One rear tire was entirely deflated. A railroad spike four and  three-quarters inches long, and otherwise well proportioned, had  penetrated full length. It had been picked up along the trolley  line, was probably struck by the front wheel, lifted up on end so  that the rear tire struck the sharp end exactly the right angle to  drive the spike in lengthwise of the tread.    It was a big ragged puncture which could not be repaired on the  road; there was nothing to do but stop over night and have a tire  sent out from Cleveland next day.    While waiting the next morning, we jacked up the wheel and removed  the damaged tire.    It is not easy to remove quickly and put on heavy single-tube  tires, and a few suggestions may not be amiss.    The best tools are half-leaves of carriage springs. At any  carriage shop one can get halves of broken springs. They should be  sixteen or eighteen inches long, and are ready for use without  forging filing or other preparation. With three such halves one  man can take off a tire in fifteen or twenty minutes; two men will  work a little faster; help on the road is never wanting.    Let the wheel rest on the tire with valve down; loosen all the  lugs; insert thin edge of spring-leaf between rim and tire,  breaking the cement and partially freeing tire; insert spring-leaf  farther at a point just about opposite valve and pry tire free  from rim, holding and working it free by pushing in other irons or  screw-drivers, or whatever you have handy; when lugs and tire are  out of the hollow of the rim for a distance of eighteen or twenty  inches, it will be easy to pass the iron underneath the tire,  prying up the tire until it slips over the rim, when with the  hands it can be pulled off entirely; the wheel is then raised and  the valve-stem carefully drawn out.    All this can be done with the wheel jacked up, but if resting on  the tire as suggested, the valve-stem is protected during the  efforts to loosen tire.    To put on a single-tube tire properly, the rim should be  thoroughly cleaned with gasoline, and the new tire put on with  shellac or cement, or with simply the lugs to hold.    Shellac can be obtained at any drug store, is quickly brushed over  both the tire and the rim, and the tire put in place--that holds  very well. Cement well applied is stronger. If the rim is well  covered with old cement, gasoline applied to the surface of the  old cement will soften it; or with a plumber's torch the rim may  be heated without injuring enamel and the cement melted, or take a  cake of cement, soften it in gasoline or melt it, or even light it  like a stick of sealing-wax and apply it to the rim. If hot cement  is used it will be necessary to heat the rim after the tire is on  to make a good job.    After the rim is prepared, insert valve-stem and the lugs near it;  let the wheel down so as to rest on that part of the tire, then  with the iron work the tire into the rim, beginning at each side  of valve. The tire goes into place easily until the top is reached  where the two irons are used to lift tire and lugs over the rim;  once in rim it is often necessary to pound the tire with the flat  of the iron to work the lugs into their places; by striking the  tire in the direction it should go the lugs one by one will slip  into their holes; put on the nuts and the work is done.    In selecting a half-leaf of a spring, choose one the width of the  springs to the machine, and carry along three or four small spring  clips, for it is quite likely a spring may be broken in the course  of a long run, and, if so, the half-leaf can be clipped over the  break, making the broken spring as serviceable and strong for the  time being as if sound.          CHAPTER FIVE ON TO BUFFALO  \"GEE WHIZ!!\"    From Painesville three roads led east,--the North Ridge, Middle  Ridge, and South Ridge. We followed the middle road, which is said  to be by far the best; it certainly is as good a gravel road as  one could ask. Some miles out a turn is made to the South Ridge  for Ashtabula.    There is said to be a good road out of Ashtabula; possibly there  is, but we missed it at one of the numerous cross roads, and soon  found ourselves wallowing through corn-fields, climbing hills, and  threading valleys in the vain effort to find Girard,--a point  quite out of our way, as we afterwards learned.    The Professor's bump of locality is a depression. As a passenger  without serious occupation, it fell to his lot to inquire the way.  This he would do very minutely, with great suavity and becoming  gravity, and then with no sign of hesitation indicate invariably  the wrong road. Once, after crossing a field where there were no  fences to mark the highway, descending a hill we could not have  mounted, and finding a stream that seemed impassable, the  Professor quietly remarked,--    \"That old man must have been mistaken regarding the road; yet he  had lived on that corner forty years. Strange how little some  people know about their surroundings!\"    \"But are you sure he said the first turn to the left?\"    \"He said the first turn, but whether to the left or right I cannot  now say. It must have been to the right.\"    \"But, my dear Professor, you said to the left.\"    \"Well, we were going pretty fast when we came to the four corners,  and something had to be said, and said quickly. I notice that on  an automobile decision is more important than accuracy. After  being hauled over the country for three days, I have made up my  mind that automobiles are driven upon the hypothesis that it is  better to lose the road, lose life, lose anything than lose time,  therefore, when you ask me which way to turn, you will get an  immediate, if not an accurate, response; besides, there is a  bridge ahead, a little village across the stream, so the road  leads somewhere.\"    Now and then the Professor would jump out to assist some female in  distress with her horse; at first it was a matter of gallantry,  then a duty, then a burden. Towards the last it used to delight  him to see people frantically turning into lanes, fields, anywhere  to get out of the way.    The horse is a factor to be considered--and placated. He is in  possession and cannot be forcibly ejected,--a sort of  terre-tenant; such title as he has must be respected.    After wrestling with an unusually notional beast, to the great  disorder of clothing and temper, the Professor said,--    \"The brain of the horse is small; it is an animal of little sense  and great timidity, but it knows more than most people who attempt  to drive.\"    In reality horses are seldom driven; they generally go as they  please, with now and then a hint as to which corner to turn. Nine  times out of ten it is the driven horse that makes trouble for  owners of automobiles. The drunken driver never has any trouble;  his horses do not stop, turn about, or shy into the ditch; the man  asleep on the box is perfectly safe; his horse ambles on,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],[0,"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#8)"],[1,"breaks, and through the sweep of decks each man      Stands coldly by his gun--  As cold as it. But he shall warm--    Warm with the solemn metal there,    And all its ordered fury share,  In attitude a gladiatorial form.    The Admiral--yielding the love    Which held his life and ship so dear--  Sailed second in the long fleet's midmost line;      Yet thwarted all their care:  He lashed himself aloft, and shone    Star of the fight, with influence sent    Throughout the dusk embattlement;  And so they neared the strait and walls of stone.    No sprintly fife as in the field,    The decks were hushed like fanes in prayer;  Behind each man a holy angel stood--      He stood, though none was 'ware.  Out spake the forts on either hand,    Back speak the ships when spoken to,    And set their flags in concert true,  And _On and in!_ is Farragut's command.    But what delays? 'mid wounds above    Dim buoys give hint of death below--  Sea-ambuscades, where evil art had aped      Hecla that hides in snow.  The centre-van, entangled, trips;    The starboard leader holds straight on:    A cheer for the Tecumseh!--nay,  Before their eyes the turreted ship goes down!    The fire redoubles, While the fleet    Hangs dubious--ere the horror ran--  The Admiral rushes to his rightful place--      Well met! apt hour and man!--  Closes with peril, takes the lead,    His action is a stirring call;    He strikes his great heart through them all,  And is the genius of their daring deed.    The forts are daunted, slack their fire,    Confounded by the deadlier aim  And rapid broadsides of the speeding fleet,      And fierce denouncing flame.  Yet shots from four dark hulls embayed    Come raking through the loyal crews,    Whom now each dying mate endues  With his last look, anguished yet undismayed.    A flowering time to guilt is given,    And traitors have their glorying hour;  O late, but sure, the righteous Paramount comes--      Palsy is on their power!  So proved it with the rebel keels,    The strong-holds past: assailed, they run;    The Selma strikes, and the work is done:  The dropping anchor the achievement seals.    But no, she turns--the Tennessee!    The solid Ram of iron and oak,  Strong as Evil, and bold as Wrong, though lone--      A pestilence in her smoke.  The flag-ship is her singled mark,    The wooden Hartford. Let her come;    She challenges the planet of Doom,  And naught shall save her--not her iron bark.    _Slip anchor, all! and at her, all!_    _Bear down with rushing beaks--and_ now!  First the Monongahela struck--and reeled;      The Lackawana's prow  Next crashed--crashed, but not crashing; then    The Admiral rammed, and rasping nigh    Sloped in a broadside, which glanced by:  The Monitors battered at her adamant den.    The Chickasaw plunged beneath the stern    And pounded there; a huge wrought orb  From the Manhattan pierced one wall, but dropped;      Others the seas absorb.  Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in,    Hampered and cramped, the bad one fought--    Spat ribald curses from the port  Who shutters, jammed, locked up this Man-of-Sin.    No pause or stay. They made a din    Like hammers round a boiler forged;  Now straining strength tangled itself with strength,      Till Hate her will disgorged.  The white flag showed, the fight was won--    Mad shouts went up that shook the Bay;    But pale on the scarred fleet's decks there lay  A silent man for every silenced gun.    And quiet far below the wave,    Where never cheers shall move their sleep,  Some who did boldly, nobly earn them, lie--      Charmed children of the deep.  But decks that now are in the seed,    And cannon yet within the mine,    Shall thrill the deeper, gun and pine,  Because of the Tecumseh's glorious deed.        Sheridan at Cedar Creek.  (October, 1864.)      Shoe the steed with silver    That bore him to the fray,  When he heard the guns at dawning--        Miles away;  When he heard them calling, calling--      Mount! nor stay:        Quick, or all is lost;        They've surprised and stormed the post,        They push your routed host--    Gallop! retrieve the day.    House the horse in ermine--    For the foam-flake blew  White through the red October;    He thundered into view;  They cheered him in the looming,    Horseman and horse they knew.        The turn of the tide began,        The rally of bugles ran,        He swung his hat in the van;    The electric hoof-spark flew.    Wreathe the steed and lead him--    For the charge he led  Touched and turned the cypress    Into amaranths for the head  Of Philip, king of riders,    Who raised them from the dead.        The camp (at dawning lost),        By eve, recovered--forced,        Rang with laughter of the host    At belated Early fled.    Shroud the horse in sable--    For the mounds they heap!  There is firing in the Valley,    And yet no strife they keep;  It is the parting volley,    It is the pathos deep.        There is glory for the brave        Who lead, and noblys ave,        But no knowledge in the grave    Where the nameless followers sleep.        In the Prison Pen.  (1864.)      Listless he eyes the palisades    And sentries in the glare;  'Tis barren as a pelican-beach--    But his world is ended there.    Nothing to do; and vacant hands    Bring on the idiot-pain;  He tries to think--to recollect,    But the blur is on his brain.    Around him swarm the plaining ghosts    Like those on Virgil's shore--  A wilderness of faces dim,    And pale ones gashed and hoar.    A smiting sun. No shed, no tree;    He totters to his lair--  A den that sick hands dug in earth    Ere famine wasted there,    Or, dropping in his place, he swoons,    Walled in by throngs that press,  Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead--    Dead in his meagreness.        The College Colonel.      He rides at their head;    A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,  One slung arm is in splints, you see,    Yet he guides his strong steed--how coldly too.    He brings his regiment home--    Not as they filed two years before,  But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn,  Like castaway sailors, who--stunned      By the surf's loud roar,    Their mates dragged back and seen no more--  Again and again breast the surge,    And at last crawl, spent, to shore.    A still rigidity and pale--    An Indian aloofness lones his brow;  He has lived a thousand years  Compressed in battle's pains and prayers,    Marches and watches slow.    There are welcoming shouts, and flags;    Old men off hat to the Boy,  Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,    But to _him_--there comes alloy.    It is not that a leg is lost,    It is not that an arm is maimed.  It is not that the fever has racked--    Self he has long disclaimed.    But all through the Seven Day's Fight,    And deep in the wilderness grim,  And in the field-hospital tent,    And Petersburg crater, and dim  Lean brooding in Libby, there came--    Ah heaven!--what _truth_ to him.        The Eagle of the Blue.[12]      Aloft he guards the starry folds    Who is the brother of the star;  The bird whose joy is in the wind    Exultleth in the war.    No painted plume--a sober hue,    His beauty is his power;  That eager calm of gaze intent    Foresees the Sibyl's hour.    Austere, he crowns the swaying perch,    Flapped by the angry flag;  The hurricane from the battery sings,    But his claw has known the crag.    Amid the scream of shells, his scream    Runs shrilling; and the glare  Of eyes that brave the blinding sun    The vollied flame can bear.    The pride of quenchless strength is his--    Strength which, though chained, avails;  The very rebel looks and thrills--    The anchored Emblem hails.    Though scarred in many a furious fray,    No deadly hurt he knew;  Well may we think his years are charmed--    The Eagle of the Blue.        A Dirge for McPherson,[13]  Killed in front of Atlanta.  (July, 1864.)      Arms reversed and banners craped--      Muffled drums;  Snowy horses sable-draped--      McPherson comes.          _But, tell us, shall we know him more,        Lost-Mountain and lone Kenesaw?_    Brave the sword upon the pall--      A gleam in gloom;  So a bright name lighteth all      McPherson's doom.    Bear him through the chapel-door--      Let priest in stole  Pace before the warrior      Who led. Bell--toll!    Lay him down within the nave,      The Lesson read--  Man is noble, man is brave,      But man's--a weed.    Take him up again and wend      Graveward, nor weep:  There's a trumpet that shall rend      This Soldier's sleep.    Pass the ropes the coffin round,      And let descend;  Prayer and volley--let it sound      McPherson's end.          _True fame is his, for life is o'er--        Sarpedon of the mighty war._        At the Cannon's Mouth.  Destruction of the Ram Albermarle by the Torpedo-Launch.  (October, 1864.)      Palely intent, he urged his keel    Full on the guns, and touched the spring;  Himself involved in the bolt he drove  Timed with the armed hull's shot that stove  His shallop--die or do!  Into the flood his life he threw,    Yet lives--unscathed--a breathing thing  To marvel at.                  He has his fame;  But that mad dash at death, how name?    Had Earth no charm to stay the Boy    From the martyr-passion? Could he dare  Disdain the Paradise of opening joy    Which beckons the fresh heart every where?  Life has more lures than any girl    For youth and strength; puts forth a share  Of beauty, hinting of yet rarer store;  And ever with unfathomable eyes,      Which baffingly entice,  Still strangely does Adonis draw.  And life once over, who shall tell the rest?  Life is, of all we know, God's best.  What imps these eagles then, that they  Fling disrespect on life by that proud way  In which they soar above our lower clay.    Pretense of wonderment and doubt unblest:    In Cushing's eager deed was shown    A spirit which brave poets own--  That"]]]
