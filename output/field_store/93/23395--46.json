But he adds, that \"he persisted for  three months till they took no further notice of this novelty.  Foreigners began to use theirs, and then the English. Now it is become  a great trade in London.\" This footman, if he does not arrogate too  much to his own confidence, was the first man distinguished by  carrying and using a silken umbrella. He is the founder of a most  populous school. The state of our population might now in some degree  be ascertained by the number of umbrellas.    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      GIPSIES.      Gipsies in times of yore were the scape-goats of the peasantry: if  \"cock\" were \"purloined\" or any other rural mischief done by night, it  was immediately fathered upon a neighbouring tent of \"the dark race.\"  No further evidence was required than the pot boiling on stick  transverse: no one hesitated to conclude that the said pot contained  the _corpus delicti_: that the individual missing cock was there  parboiling, and that the swarthy race lolling around the fire, or  peeping from beneath the canvass roof, were resting from the unholy  labours of the night. Crime, however, has made such rapid marches that  it has long been seen that the gipsies could not perpetrate the whole  of it: and now it is pretty clear they are, and probably have always  been, innocent of the whole of it. It is an event of extreme rarity to  see a gipsy in a court of justice, and we have reason to believe that  it has come to pass that farmers entertain a belief that the tent of  the wanderer, with its nightly blaze and its dark shadows flitting  about it, is a protection to their property. There is every  probability in favour of the justice of this character. The life of  the gipsy is not unlucrative: his wants are few and coarse, and the  calls upon him are scarcely any. He pays no rent: he is exempt from  taxes: he spends nothing in the luxury of attire: no man can bring him  in a bill. Being himself a mender and universal repairer, he is under  the necessity of demanding no man's aid. His horse or his ass feeds on  Nature's common, the hedge-side, the waste corner, the forest thicket,  well known and long haunted by him and his tribe. Gipsies are subject  to few diseases: they seldom ask the doctor's assistance but for one  friendly office, and that serves a man his lifetime. The open air, the  inconstancy of their labour, the sufficiency of their food, and the  quantity of healthy exercise, necessarily render these Arabs of  civilization the healthiest part of the people. As the monks of old  always managed to select a happy site for their establishments, so  does the gipsy always contrive to fix upon a pleasant and healthy spot  for the pitching of his tent. It is sure to be near a brook for the  supply of fresh water for the pot, and a washing-place for the family  rags: it generally lies under the shelter of some umbrageous tree, it  will always be found to have a view of the road, and invariably placed  on the edge of some nice short and sweet morsel of grass for the  recreation of the quadrupeds of the party.    The character of the gipsy has not been well understood. It is  altogether oriental: he is quiet, patient, sober, long suffering,  pleasant in speech, indolent but handy, far from speculative, and yet  good at succedaneum: when his anger is kindled, it descends like  lightning: unlike his dog, his wrath gives no notice by grumbling: he  blazes up like one of his own fires of dried fern. Quarrels do not  often take place among them, but when they do, they are dreadful. The  laws of the country in which they sojourn have so far banished the use  of knives from among them that they only grind them, otherwise these  conflicts would always be fatal. They fight like tigers with tooth and  nail, and knee and toe, and seem animated only with the spirit of  daemonism. Luckily the worst weapon they use is a stick, and, if the  devil tempts, a hedge-stake.    We have been put in mind to say something of the gipsies by having  witnessed the consequences of one of these affrays, which has brought  us still better acquainted with these singular people. A quarrel  originating in jealousy had produced results of the most serious  nature. A blow on the head with a tent-pole had evidently produced  concussion of the brain if not fracture, and the victim was lying on  his straw bed in a state of profound coma. The tent was tripartite,  being formed of three main tops meeting in a centre: one was sacred to  the women--the gynekeion of the Greeks, the anderoon of the Persians:  in the others were collected the whole faction of the dying man. Nine  or ten swarthy but handsome countenances were anxiously watching the  struggling breath of their unhappy comrade--some sobbing, some  grief-stricken, some sombre, none savage. An old crone was  administering ineffectual milk, perhaps the very woman who had found  the same fluid so nutritious some thirty years ago. Before, or rather,  under her lay as noble a form as nature ever moulded, with a fine  dark, but thoroughly Indian face, covered with the clammy sweat of  apoplectic death. There was no want of light, the fire at the mouth  every now and then sent in a volume of illumination, and when the  medical men arrived there was scarcely a hand that did not contain a  candle in the hope of aiding their investigation. The man died on the  fourth day: the surgeons were compelled to mangle him in their search  for a fracture; after his death justice demanded a still further  investigation of the corpse: and yet during all these trying  circumstances an important witness can declare that the behaviour of  the supposed lawless people was not merely decent--it was more than  exemplary--it was delicate, tender, nay, refined; it was moreover  exempt from prejudice, at the same time that it was full of feeling.  Were the details in place here, it would perhaps be allowed that few  brighter examples of friendship and right feeling were to be found  than in this instance occurred among the \"dark race,\" as they call  themselves.    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.           *       *       *       *       *      ARROGANCE.      Owen Feltham says: \"I never yet found pride in a noble nature, nor  humility in an unworthy mind. It may seem strange to an inconsiderate  eye, that such a poor violet virtue should ever dwell with honour; and  that such an aspiring fume as pride is, should ever sojourn with a  constant baseness. It is sure, we seldom find it, but in such as being  conscious of their own deficiency, think there is no way to get honour  but by a bold assuming it. If you search for high and strained  carriages, you shall for the most part meet with them in low men.  Arrogance is a weed that ever grows in a dunghill. It is from the  rankness of that soil that she hath her height and spreadings. Witness  clowns, fools, and fellows that from nothing are lifted some few steps  upon fortune's ladder; where, seeing the glorious representment of  honour above, they are so greedy of embracing, that they strive to  leap thither at once: so by overreaching themselves in the way, they  fail of the end, and fall. And all this happiness, either for want of  education, which should season their minds with the generous precepts  of morality; or, which is more powerful, example; or else for lack of  a discerning judgment, which will tell them that the best way thither,  is to go about by humility and desert. Otherwise the river of contempt  runs betwixt them and it: and if they go not by these passages, they  must of necessity either turn back with shame, or suffer in the  desperate venture. Of trees, I observe, God hath chosen the vine, a  low plant that creeps upon the helpful wall. Of all beasts, the soft  and patient lamb. Of all fowls, the mild and gall-less dove. Christ is  the rose of the field, and the lily of the valley. When God appeared  to Moses, it was not in the lofty cedar, nor the sturdy oak, nor the  spreading plane; but in a bush, an humble, slender, abject shrub: as  if he would, by these elections, check the conceited arrogance of man.  Nothing procureth love like humility; nothing hate, like pride. The  proud man walks among daggers pointed against him; whereas the humble  and the affable, have the people for their guard in dangers. To be  humble to our superiors, is duty; to our equals, courtesy; to our  inferiors, nobleness: which for all her lowness, carries such a sway  that she may command their souls. But we must take heed, we express it  not in unworthy actions. For then leaving virtue, it falls into  disdained baseness, which is the undoubtable badge of one that will  betray society. So far as a man, both in words and deeds, may be free  from flattery and unmanly cowardice, he may be humble with  commendation; but surely no circumstance can make the expression of  pride laudable. If ever it be, it is when it meets with audacious  pride, and conquers. Of this good it may then be author, that the  affronting man, by his own folly, may learn the way to his duty and  wit. Yet this I cannot so well call pride, as an emulation of the  divine justice; which will always vindicate itself upon presumptuous  ones, and is indeed said to fight against no sin but pride.\"    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *    _Curious Marriage_.--In the church of St. Martin, formerly called St.  Crosse, Leicester, the marriage register contains an entry of the  names of Thomas Tilsey and Ursula Russel, the first of whom being  \"deofe and also dombe,\" it was agreed by the bishop, mayor, and other  gentlemen of the town, that certain signs and actions of the  bridegroom should be admitted instead of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#8)"],[1,"mind quickly enough to  buy, but this time he had done so.    \"There are Vandas,\" he said, \"and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis.\" He  surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid  out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was telling his cousin  all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was his  custom to live all his visits to London over again in the evening for her  and his own entertainment.    \"I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some  of them--some of them--I feel sure, do you know, that some of them will be  remarkable. I don't know how it is, but I feel just as sure as if some one  had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable.    \"That one \"--he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome--\"was not identified. It  may be a Palaeonophis--or it may not. It may be a new species, or even a  new genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever collected.\"    \"I don't like the look of it,\" said his housekeeper. \"It's such an ugly  shape.\"    \"To me it scarcely seems to have a shape.\"    \"I don't like those things that stick out,\" said his housekeeper.    \"It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow.\"    \"It looks,\" said the housekeeper, \"like a spider shamming dead.\"    Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. \"It is  certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of these  things from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very beautiful  orchid indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see to-night just  exactly what to do with these things, and to-morrow I shall set to work.\"    \"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp--I  forget which,\" he began again presently, \"with one of these very orchids  crushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some kind  of native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps are very  unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of him by the  jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his life to  obtain.\"    \"I think none the better of it for that.\"    \"Men must work though women may weep,\" said Wedderburn with profound  gravity.    \"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill of  fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine--if men were left to  themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine--and no one round you  but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are most disgusting  wretches--and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good nurses, not having the  necessary training. And just for people in England to have orchids!\"    \"I don't suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that kind  of thing,\" said Wedderburn. \"Anyhow, the natives of his party were  sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his  colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior;  though they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had let it  wither. And it makes these things more interesting.\"    \"It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria  clinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying across  that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot  eat another mouthful of dinner.\"    \"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the  window-seat. I can see them just as well there.\"    The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little  hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the  other mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a  wonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new  orchids to his friends, and over and over again he reverted to his  expectation of something strange.    Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but  presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was  delighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it  at once, directly he made the discovery.    \"That is a bud,\" he said, \"and presently there will be a lot of leaves  there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets.\"    \"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown,\" said  his housekeeper. \"I don't like them.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I don't know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can't help  my likes and dislikes.\"    \"I don't know for certain, but I don't _think_ there are any orchids  I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of  course. You see they are a little flattened at the ends.\"    \"I don't like 'em,\" said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning  away. \"I know it's very silly of me--and I'm very sorry, particularly as  you like the thing so much. But I can't help thinking of that corpse.\"    \"But it may not be that particular plant. That was merely a guess of  mine.\"    His housekeeper shrugged her shoulders. \"Anyhow I don't like it,\" she  said.    Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did  not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid in  particular, whenever he felt inclined.    \"There are such queer things about orchids,\" he said one day; \"such  possibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation,  and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was  contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant.  Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which  cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the  Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known that can possibly  fertilise them, and some of them have never been found with seed.\"    \"But how do they form new plants?\"    \"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily  explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?    \"Very likely,\" he added, \"_my_ orchid may be something extraordinary  in that way. If so I shall study it. I have often thought of making  researches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or  something else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to  unfold now. I do wish you would come and see them!\"    But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache.  She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets, which were now  some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her of  tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams,  growing after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to her  entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and  Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary broad  form, and a deep glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red towards  the base He knew of no other leaves quite like them. The plant was placed  on a low bench near the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement  by which a tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy. And  he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the  approaching flowering of this strange plant.    And at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little glass  house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great  _Paloeonophis Lowii_ hid the corner where his new darling stood.  There was a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that  overpowered every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.    Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And,  behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of  blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped  before them in an ecstasy of admiration.    The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the  heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a wonderful  bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the  genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the  place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.    He would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the  thermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the  floor were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green leaves  behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and then in a  curve upward.           *      *       *       *       *    At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable  custom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.    \"He is worshipping that horrid orchid,\" she told herself, and waited ten  minutes. \"His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him.\"    She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his name.  There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and loaded  with an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the bricks  between the hot-water pipes.    For a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless.    He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The  tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were  crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight, with their  ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.    She did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant  tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.    With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away  from the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and their  sap dripped red.    Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel.  How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white  inflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must  not. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had"]]]
