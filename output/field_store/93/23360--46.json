Nancy Webb, with a very fine color,  a very curly fringe, and a wide smiling mouth revealing a fine set of  teeth, came to the bar at the summons of a stoutish old gentleman in  spectacles who walked with a stick.    The stoutish old gentleman had a glass of bitter beer, and then said in  the peculiarly quiet voice of a very deaf man: \"Can you tell me, if you  please, the way into the main Catton road?\"    \"Down the lane, turn to the right at the cross-roads, then first to the  left.\"    The old gentleman waited with his hand to his ear for some few seconds  after she had finished speaking, and then resumed in his whispering voice:  \"I'm afraid I'm very deaf this morning.\" He fumbled in his pocket and  produced a note-book and pencil. \"May I trouble you to write it down? I'm  so very deaf at times that I--Thank you.\"    The girl wrote the direction, and the old gentleman bade her good-morning  and left. All down the lane he walked slowly with his stick. At the  cross-roads he turned, put the stick under his arm, thrust his spectacles  into his pocket, and strode away in the ordinary guise of Martin Hewitt.  He pulled out his note-book, examined Miss Webb's direction very  carefully, and then went off another way altogether, toward the Hare and  Hounds.    Kentish lounged moodily in his bar. \"Well, my boy,\" said Hewitt, \"has  Steggles wiped out the tracks?\"    \"Not yet; I haven't told him. But he's somewhere about; I'll tell him  now.\"    \"No, don't. I don't think we'll have that done, after all. I expect he'll  want to go out soon--at any rate, some time during the day. Let him go  whenever he likes. I'll sit upstairs a bit in the club-room.\"    \"Very well. But how do you know Steggles will be going out?\"    \"Well, he's pretty restless after his lost _protege_, isn't he? I don't  suppose he'll be able to remain idle long.\"    \"And about Crockett. Do you give him up?\"    \"Oh, no! Don't you be impatient. I can't say I'm quite confident yet of  laying hold of him--the time is so short, you see--but I think I shall at  least have news for you by the evening.\"    Hewitt sat in the club-room until the afternoon, taking his lunch there.  At length he saw, through the front window, Raggy Steggles walking down  the road. In an instant Hewitt was down-stairs and at the door. The road  bent eighty yards away, and as soon as Steggles passed the bend the  detective hurried after him.    All the way to Padfield town and more than half through it Hewitt dogged  the trainer. In the end Steggles stopped at a corner and gave a note to a  small boy who was playing near. The boy ran with the note to a bright,  well-kept house at the opposite corner. Martin Hewitt was interested to  observe the legend, \"H. Danby, Contractor,\" on a board over a gate in the  side wall of the garden behind this house. In five minutes a door in the  side gate opened, and the head and shoulders of the red-faced man emerged.  Steggles immediately hurried across and disappeared through the gate.    This was both interesting and instructive. Hewitt took up a position in  the side street and waited. In ten minutes the trainer reappeared and  hurried off the way he had come, along the street Hewitt had considerately  left clear for him. Then Hewitt strolled toward the smart house and took a  good look at it. At one corner of the small piece of forecourt garden,  near the railings, a small, baize-covered, glass-fronted notice-board  stood on two posts. On its top edge appeared the words, \"H. Danby. Houses  to be Sold or Let.\" But the only notice pinned to the green baize within  was an old and dusty one, inviting tenants for three shops, which were  suitable for any business, and which would be fitted to suit tenants.  Apply within.    Hewitt pushed open the front gate and rang the door-bell. \"There are some  shops to let, I see,\" he said, when a maid appeared. \"I should like to see  them, if you will let me have the key.\"    \"Master's out, sir. You can't see the shops till Monday.\"    \"Dear me, that's unfortunate, I'm afraid I can't wait till Monday. Didn't  Mr. Danby leave any instructions, in case anybody should inquire?\"    \"Yes, sir--as I've told you. He said anybody who called about 'em must  come again on Monday.\"    \"Oh, very well, then; I suppose I must try. One of the shops is in High  Street, isn't it?\"    \"No, sir; they're all in the new part--Granville Road.\"    \"Ah, I'm afraid that will scarcely do. But I'll see. Good-day.\"    Martin Hewitt walked away a couple of streets' lengths before he inquired  the way to Granville Road. When at last he found that thoroughfare, in a  new and muddy suburb, crowded with brick-heaps and half-finished streets,  he took a slow walk along its entire length. It was a melancholy example  of baffled enterprise. A row of a dozen or more shops had been built  before any population had arrived to demand goods. Would-be tradesmen had  taken many of these shops, and failure and disappointment stared from the  windows. Some were half covered by shutters, because the scanty stock  scarce sufficed to fill the remaining half. Others were shut almost  altogether, the inmates only keeping open the door for their own  convenience, and, perhaps, keeping down a shutter for the sake of a little  light. Others, again, had not yet fallen so low, but struggled bravely  still to maintain a show of business and prosperity, with very little  success. Opposite the shops there still remained a dusty, ill-treated  hedge and a forlorn-looking field, which an old board offered on building  leases. Altogether a most depressing spot.    There was little difficulty in identifying the three shops offered for  letting by Mr. H. Danby. They were all together near the middle of the  row, and were the only ones that appeared not yet to have been occupied. A  dusty \"To Let\" bill hung in each window, with written directions to  inquire of Mr. H. Danby or at No. 7. Now No. 7 was a melancholy baker's  shop, with a stock of three loaves and a plate of stale buns. The  disappointed baker assured Hewitt that he usually kept the keys of the  shops, but that the landlord, Mr. Danby, had taken them away the day  before to see how the ceilings were standing, and had not returned them.  \"But if you was thinking of taking a shop here,\" the poor baker added,  with some hesitation, \"I--I--if you'll excuse my advising you--I shouldn't  recommend it. I've had a sickener of it myself.\"    Hewitt thanked the baker for his advice, wished him better luck in future,  and left. To the Hare and Hounds his pace was brisk. \"Come,\" he said, as  he met Kentish's inquiring glance, \"this has been a very good day, on the  whole. I know where our man is now, and I think we can get him, by a  little management.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"Oh, down in Padfield. As a matter of fact, he's being kept there against  his will, we shall find. I see that your friend Mr. Danby is a builder as  well as a bookmaker.\"    \"Not a regular builder. He speculates in a street of new houses now and  again, that's all. But is he in it?\"    \"He's as deep in it as anybody, I think. Now, don't fly into a passion.  There are a few others in it as well, but you'll do harm if you don't keep  quiet.\"    \"But go and get the police; come and fetch him, if you know where they're  keeping him. Why----\"    \"So we will, if we can't do it without them. But it's quite possible we  can, and without all the disturbance and, perhaps, delay that calling in  the police would involve. Consider, now, in reference to your own  arrangements. Wouldn't it pay you better to get him back quietly, without  a soul knowing--perhaps not even Danby knowing--till the heat is run  to-morrow?\"    \"Well, yes, it would, of course.\"    \"Very good, then, so be it. Remember what I have told you about keeping  your mouth shut; say nothing to Steggles or anybody. Is there a cab or  brougham your son and I can have for the evening?\"    \"There's an old hiring landau in the stables you can shut up into a cab,  if that'll do.\"    \"Excellent. We'll run down to the town in it as soon as it's ready. But,  first, a word about Crockett. What sort of a lad is he? Likely to give  them trouble, show fight, and make a disturbance?\"    \"No, I should say not. He's no plucked un, certainly; all his manhood's in  his legs, I believe. You see, he ain't a big sort o' chap at best, and  he'd be pretty easy put upon--at least, I guess so.\"    \"Very good, so much the better, for then he won't have been damaged, and  they will probably only have one man to guard him. Now the carriage,  please.\"    Young Kentish was a six-foot sergeant of grenadiers home on furlough, and  luxuriating in plain clothes. He and Hewitt walked a little way toward the  town, allowing the landau to catch them up. They traveled in it to within  a hundred yards of the empty shops and then alighted, bidding the driver  wait.    \"I shall show you three empty shops,\" Hewitt said, as he and young Kentish  walked down Granville Road. \"I am pretty sure that Sammy Crockett is in  one of them, and I am pretty sure that that is the middle one. Take a look  as we go past.\"    When the shops had been slowly passed, Hewitt resumed: \"Now, did you see  anything about those shops that told a tale of any sort?\"    \"No,\" Sergeant Kentish replied. \"I can't say I noticed anything beyond the  fact that they were empty--and likely to stay so, I should think.\"    \"We'll stroll back, and look in at the windows, if nobody's watching us,\"  Hewitt said. \"You see, it's reasonable to suppose they've put him in the  middle one, because that would suit their purpose best. The shops at each  side of the three are occupied, and, if the prisoner struggled, or  shouted, or made an uproar, he might be heard if he were in one of the  shops next those inhabited. So that the middle shop is the most likely.

Papa was sold too at the same time. Papa fired a steam gin.  They ground corn and ginned cotton.    \"I stayed with Sam Hall's family. She was good to me. I had a small bed  by the fireplace. She kept me with two of her own children. Some of the  girls and boys I was raised up with live at Sanitobia now and have fine  homes. When we would be playing they would take all the toys from me.  Miss Fannie would say, 'Poor Nancy ain't got no toys.' Then they would  put them on the floor and we would all play. They had a little table. We  all eat at it. We had our own plates. We all eat out of tin plates and  had tin cups.    \"They couldn't keep me at home when papa married. I slipped off across  the pasture. There was cows and hogs in there all the time. I wasn't  afraid of them. I would get behind Miss Fannie and hide in her dress  tail when they come after me. They let me stay most of the time for  about five years. Sam Hall was good to my father and Miss Fannie about  raised me after my mother died. She made me mind but she was good to me.    \"Grandma lived with papa. She was part Indian. As long as papa lived he  share cropped and ginned. He worked as long as he was able to hit a  lick. He died four miles east out from Sanitobia on Mr. Hayshaws place.  What I told you is what I know. He said he was sold that one time.  Hubbards had plenty to eat and wear. He was a boy and they didn't want  to stunt the children. Papa was a water boy and filed the hoes for the  chopping hands. He carried a file along with them hoeing and would  sharpen their hoes and fetch 'em water in their jugs. Aunt Sallie, his  sister, took keer of the children.    \"Papa went to the War. He could blow his bugle and give all the war  signals. He got the military training. Him and his friend Charlie Grim  used to step around and show us how they had to march to orders. His  bugle had four joints. I don't know what went with it. From what they  said they didn't like the War and was so glad to get home.    \"Between the big farms they had worm fences (rail fences) and gates. You  had to get a pass from your master to go visiting. The gates had big  chains and locks on them. Some places was tollgates where they traveled  over some man's land to town. On them roads the man owned the place  charged. He kept some boy to open and shut the gate. They said the gates  was tall.    \"Some of the slaves that had hard masters run off and stay in the woods.  They had nigger dogs and would run them--catch 'em. He said one man  (Negro) was hollowing down back of the worm fence close to where they  was working. They all run to him. A great long coachwhip snake was  wrapped 'round him, his arms and all, and whooping him with its tail. It  cut gashes like a knife and the blood poured. The overseer cut the  snake's head off with his big knife and they carried him home bleeding.  His master didn't whoop him, said he had no business off in the woods.  He had run off. His master rubbed salt in the gashes. It nearly killed  him. It burnt him so bad. That stopped the blood. They said sut (soot)  would stopped the blood but it would left black mark. The salt left  white marks on him. The salt helped kill the pison (poison). Some  masters and overseers was cruel. When they was so bad marked they didn't  bring a good price. They thought they was hard to handle.    \"Aunt Jane Peterson, old friend of mine, come to visit me nearly every  year after she got so old. She told me things took place in slavery  times. She was in Virginia till after freedom. She had two girls and a  boy with a white daddy. She told me all about how that come. She said no  chance to run off or ever get off, you had to stay and take what come.  She never got to marry till after freedom. Then she had three more black  children by her husband. She said she was the cook. Old master say,  'Jane, go to the lot and get the eggs.' She was scared to go and scared  not to go. He'd beat her out there, put her head between the slip gap  where they let the hogs into the pasture from the lot down back of the  barn. She say, 'Old missis whip me. This ain't right.' He'd laugh. Said  she bore three of his children in a room in the same house his family  lived in. She lived in the same house. She had a room so as she could  build fires and cook breakfast by four o'clock sometimes, she said. She  was so glad freedom come on and soon as she heard it she took her  children and was gone, she said. She had no use for him. She was scared  to death of him. She learned to pray and prayed for freedom. She died in  Cold Water, Mississippi. She was so glad freedom come on before her  children come on old enough to sell. Part white children sold for more  than black children. They used them for house girls.    \"I don't know Ku Klux stories enough to tell one. These old tales leave  my mind. I'm 66 and all that was before my time.    \"Times is strange--hard, too. But the way I have heard they had to work  and do and go I hardly ever do grumble. I've heard so much.

There was a big plantation there then. Dr. Wright owned the plantation.  He owned my mother and father. My father and mother told me that I was  born in 1862. They didn't know the date exactly, so I put it the last  day in the year and call it December 30, 1862.    \"My father's name was William Anderson. He didn't go to the War because  he was blind. He was ignorant too. He was colored. He was a pretty good  old man when he died.    \"My mother's name was Minerva Anderson. She was three-fourths Indian,  hair way down to her waist. I was in Hot Springs blacking boots when my  mother died. I was only about eight or ten years old then. I always  regretted I wasn't able to do anything for my mother before she died. I  don't know to what tribe her people belonged.    \"Dr. Wright was awful good to his slaves.    \"I don't know just how freedom came to my folks. I never heard my father  say. They were set free, I know. They were set free when the War ended.  They never bought their freedom.    \"We lived on Tenth and near to Center in a one-room log house. That is  the earliest thing I remember. When they moved from there, my father had  accumulated enough to buy a home. He bought it at Seventh and Broadway.  He paid cash for it--five hundred and fifty dollars. That is where we  all lived until it was sold. I couldn't name the date of the sale but it  was sold for good money--about three thousand eight hundred dollars, or  maybe around four thousand. I was a young man then.    \"I remember the Brooks-Baxter War.    \"I remember the King White fooled a lot of niggers and armed them and  brought them up here. The niggers and Republicans here fought them and  run them back where they come from.    \"I know Hot Springs when the main street was a creek. I can't remember  when I first went there. The government bath-house was called 'Ral  Hole', because it was mostly people with bad diseases that went there.    \"After the War, my father worked for a rich man named Hunter. He was  yardman and took care of the horse. My mother was living then.    \"Scipio Jones and I were boys together. We slept on pool tables many a  time when we didn't have no other place to sleep. He was poor when he  was a boy and glad to get hold of a dime, or a nickel. He and I don't  speak today because he robbed me. I had a third interest in my place. I  gave him money to buy my place in for me. It was up for sale and I  wanted to get possession. He gave me some papers to sign and when I  found out what was happening, he had all my property.
