But upon men and beasts the sun sent a drowsiness. The river monsters  along the river's marge lay dormant in the slime. The sailors pitched  a pavilion, with golden tassels, for the captain upon the deck, and  then went, all but the helmsman, under a sail that they had hung as an  awning between two masts. Then they told tales to one another, each of  his own city or of the miracles of his god, until all were fallen  asleep. The captain offered me the shade of his pavilion with the gold  tassels, and there we talked for a while, he telling me that he was  taking merchandise to Perdondaris, and that he would take back to fair  Belzoond things appertaining to the affairs of the sea. Then, as I  watched through the pavilion's opening the brilliant birds and  butterflies that crossed and recrossed over the river, I fell asleep,  and dreamed that I was a monarch entering his capital underneath  arches of flags, and all the musicians of the world were there,  playing melodiously their instruments; but no one cheered.    In the afternoon, as the day grew cooler again, I awoke and found the  captain buckling on his scimitar, which he had taken off him while he  rested.    And now we were approaching the wide court of Astahahn, which opens  upon the river. Strange boats of antique design were chained there to  the steps. As we neared it we saw the open marble court, on three  sides of which stood the city fronting on colonnades. And in the court  and along the colonnades the people of that city walked with solemnity  and care according to the rites of ancient ceremony. All in that city  was of ancient device; the carving on the houses, which, when age had  broken it remained unrepaired, was of the remotest times, and  everywhere were represented in stone beasts that have long since  passed away from Earth--the dragon, the griffin, and the hippogriffin,  and the different species of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found,  whether material or custom, that was new in Astahahn. Now they took no  notice at all of us as we went by, but continued their processions and  ceremonies in the ancient city, and the sailors, knowing their custom,  took no notice of them. But I called, as we came near, to one who  stood beside the water's edge, asking him what men did in Astahahn and  what their merchandise was, and with whom they traded. He said, \"Here  we have fettered and manacled Time, who would otherwise slay the  gods.\"    I asked him what gods they worshipped in that city, and he said, \"All  those gods whom Time has not yet slain.\" Then he turned from me and  would say no more, but busied himself in behaving in accordance with  ancient custom. And so, according to the will of Yann, we drifted  onwards and left Astahahn, and we found in greater quantities such  birds as prey on fishes. And they were very wonderful in their  plumage, and they came not out of the jungle, but flew, with their  long necks stretched out before them, and their legs lying on the wind  behind straight up the river over the mid-stream.    And now the evening began to gather in. A thick white mist had  appeared over the river, and was softly rising higher. It clutched at  the trees with long impalpable arms, it rose higher and higher,  chilling the air; and white shapes moved away into the jungle as  though the ghosts of shipwrecked mariners were searching stealthily in  the darkness for the spirits of evil that long ago had wrecked them on  the Yann.    As the sun sank behind the field of orchids that grew on the matted  summit of the jungle, the river monsters came wallowing out of the  slime in which they had reclined during the heat of the day, and the  great beasts of the jungle came down to drink. The butterflies a while  since were gone to rest. In little narrow tributaries that we passed  night seemed already to have fallen, though the sun which had  disappeared from us had not yet set.    And now the birds of the jungle came flying home far over us, with the  sunlight glistening pink upon their breasts, and lowered their pinions  as soon as they saw the Yann, and dropped into the trees. And the  widgeon began to go up the river in great companies, all whistling,  and then would suddenly wheel and all go down again. And there shot by  us the small and arrow-like teal; and we heard the manifold cries of  flocks of geese, which the sailors told me had recently come in from  crossing over the Lispasian ranges; every year they come by the same  way, close by the peak of Mluna, leaving it to the left, and the  mountain eagles know the way they come and--men say--the very hour,  and every year they expect them by the same way as soon as the snows  have fallen upon the Northern Plains. But soon it grew so dark that we  saw these birds no more, and only heard the whirring of their wings,  and of countless others besides, until they all settled down along the  banks of the river, and it was the hour when the birds of the night  went forth. Then the sailors lit the lanterns for the night, and huge  moths appeared, flapping about the ship, and at moments their gorgeous  colours would be revealed by the lanterns, then they would pass into  the night again, where all was black. And again the sailors prayed,  and thereafter we supped and slept, and the helmsman took our lives  into his care.    When I awoke I found that we had indeed come to Perdondaris, that  famous city. For there it stood upon the left of us, a city fair and  notable, and all the more pleasant for our eyes to see after the  jungle that was so long with us. And we were anchored by the  marketplace, and the captain's merchandise was all displayed, and a  merchant of Perdondaris stood looking at it. And the captain had his  scimitar in his hand, and was beating with it in anger upon the deck,  and the splinters were flying up from the white planks; for the  merchant had offered him a price for his merchandise that the captain  declared to be an insult to himself and his country's gods, whom he  now said to be great and terrible gods, whose curses were to be  dreaded. But the merchant waved his hands, which were of great  fatness, showing his pink palms, and swore that of himself he thought  not at all, but only of the poor folk in the huts beyond the city to  whom he wished to sell the merchandise for as low a price as possible,  leaving no remuneration for himself. For the merchandise was mostly  the thick toomarund carpets that in the winter keep the wind from the  floor, and tollub which the people smoke in pipes. Therefore the  merchant said if he offered a piffek more the poor folk must go  without their toomarunds when the winter came, and without their  tollub in the evenings, or else he and his aged father must starve  together. Thereat the captain lifted his scimitar to his own throat,  saying that he was now a ruined man, and that nothing remained to him  but death. And while he was carefully lifting he beard with his left  hand, the merchant eyed the merchandise again, and said that rather  than see so worthy a captain die, a man for whom he had conceived an  especial love when first he saw the manner in which he handled his  ship, he and his aged father should starve together and therefore he  offered fifteen piffeks more.    When he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his  gods that they might yet sweeten this merchant's bitter heart--to his  little lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.    At last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain  wept, for he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant  also wept, for he said that he was thinking of his aged father, and of  how soon he would starve, and he hid his weeping face with both his  hands, and eyed the tollub again between his fingers. And so the  bargain was concluded, and the merchant took the toomarund and tollub,  paying for them out of a great clinking purse. And these were packed  up into bales again, and three of the merchant's slaves carried them  upon their heads into the city. And all the while the sailors had sat  silent, cross-legged in a crescent upon the deck, eagerly watching the  bargain, and now a murmur of satisfaction arose among them, and they  began to compare it among themselves with other bargains that they had  known. And I found out from them that there are seven merchants in  Perdondaris, and that they had all come to the captain one by one  before the bargaining began, and each had warned him privately against  the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the wine  of his own country, that they make in fair Belzoond, but could in no  wise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over, and the  sailors were seated at the first meal of the day, the captain appeared  among them with a cask of that wine, and we broached it with care and  all made merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because  he knew that he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the  bargain that he had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their  native land, and soon their thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and  the little neighbouring cities of Durl and Duz.    But for me the captain poured into a little glass some heavy yellow  wine from a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things.  Thick and sweet it was, even like honey, yet there was in its heart a  mighty, ardent fire which had authority over souls of men. It was  made, the captain told me, with great subtlety by the secret craft of  a family of six who lived in a hut on the mountains of Hian Min.

It is impossible to conceive any trash more despicable than the slang  songs which are current amongst the common people in Ireland; and this  is the more to be lamented, as the extreme susceptibility of the people  makes them liable to be easily moved to either good or evil by their  songs. Even the native Irish songs, as we are informed in Miss Brooke's  _Reliques of Irish Poetry_, are sadly interpolated with nonsensical  passages, which have been introduced to supply the place of lost or  forgotten lines; and of humorous lyrical poetry, she says there was none  in the language worth translating. Moore has given to the beautiful airs  of Ireland beautiful words; but Moore is a poet for ladies and  gentlemen, not for mankind. It may be, that there are not materials in  Ireland, for a kindred spirit to that of Burns to work upon; but the  fact is but too true, that the _poor_ Irishman has no song of even  decent ability, to cheer his hours of merriment, or soothe the period of  his sadness. Honour and undying praise be upon the memory of Burns, who  has left to us those songs which, like the breath of nature, from whose  fresh inspiration they were caught, are alike refreshing to the monarch  and the clown!--Ibid.           *       *       *       *       *      A REAL MIRACLE.      The _fable_ of Dr. Southey's _Pilgrim of Compostella_, is as follows:--    A family set forth from Aquitaine to visit the shrine of St. James, at  Compostella, whither, according to the Catholic faith, the decapitated  body of that saint was conveyed from Palestine, (miraculously of  course,) in a ship of marble. At a certain small town by the way, their  son Pierre is tempted by the innkeeper's daughter. Like a second Joseph,  he resists the immodest damsel; like Potiphar's wife, she converts her  love to hate, and accuses the virtuous youth of a capital crime. Her  false oaths prevail, and he is condemned to the gallows. Rejoicing in  his martyred innocence, he exhorts his parents to pursue their  pilgrimage, and pray for the peace of his soul. Sorrowing, they proceed,  and returning, find their son hanging by the neck alive, and singing  psalms--in no actual pain--but naturally desirous to be freed from his  extraordinary state of suspended animation. They repair to the chief  magistrate of the town, by whose authority the youth was executed--find  his worship at dinner--relate the wonderful preservation of their  son--and request that he may be restored. The magistrate is incredulous,  and declares that he would sooner believe that the fowls on which he was  dining would rise again in full feather. The miracle is performed. The  cock and hen spring from the ocean of their own gravy, clacking and  crowing, with all appurtenances of spur, comb, and feather. Pierre, of  course, is liberated, and declared innocent. The cock and hen become  objects of veneration--live in a state of chastity--and are finally  translated--leaving just two eggs, from which arise another immaculate  cock and hen. The breed is perhaps still in existence, and time hath  been, that a lucrative trade was carried on in their feathers!!!--Ibid..           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.        A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.    SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *    Of Hogarth's first attempt at satire, the following story is related by  Nichols, who had it from one of Hogarth's fellow workmen. \"One summer  Sunday, during his apprenticeship, he went with three companions to  Highgate, and the weather being warm and the way dusty, they went into a  public house, and called for ale. There happened to be other customers  in the house, who to free drinking added fierce talking, and a quarrel  ensued. One of them on receiving a blow with the bottom of a quart pot,  looked so ludicrously rueful, that Hogarth snatched out a pencil and  sketched him as he stood. It was very like and very laughable, and  contributed to the restoration of order and good humour.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE \"GOOD BOY\" LOVER.      \"When I was a lad,\" said a facetious gentleman to the recorder of the  anecdote, \"I was, or rather fancied myself to be, desperately in love  with a very charming young lady. Dining at her parents' house one day, I  was unfortunately helped to the gizzard of a chicken, attached to one of  the wings. Aware, like most '_good boys_' that it was extremely  ungenteel to leave anything upon my plate, and being over anxious to act  with etiquette and circumspection in this interesting circle, I, as a  'good boy' wished strictly to conform myself to the rules of good  breeding. But the _gizzard_ of a fowl! Alas! it was impossible! how  unfortunate! I _abhorred_ it! No, I could not either for _love_ or money  have swallowed such a thing! So, after blushing, playing with the  annoyance, and casting many a side-long glance to see if I was observed,  I contrived at length to roll it from my plate into my _mouchoir_, which  I had placed on my knees purposely for its reception; the next minute  all was safely lodged in my pocket. Conversing with the object of my  affections, during the evening, in a state of nervous forgetfulness, I  drew forth my handkerchief, and in a superb flourish, out flew the  GIZZARD! Good heavens! my fair one stared, coloured, laughed; I was  petrified; away flew my ecstatic dreams; and out of the house I flung  myself without one '_au revoir_,' but with a consciousness of the truth  of that delectable ballad which proclaims, that 'Love _has_ EYES!!' I  thought no more of love in that quarter, believe me!\" M.L.B.           *       *       *       *       *      ADMIRAL RODNEY.      During the heat of the memorable battles with Count de Grasse, of April  9th and 12th, 1782, the gallant Rodney desired his young aid-de-camp  (Mr. Charles Dashwood[9]) to make him a glass of lemonade, the  ingredients for which were at hand. Not having any thing to stir it with  but a knife, already discoloured by the cutting of the lemon, Sir George  coolly said, on Mr. Dashwood presenting it to him, \"Child, that may do  for a midshipman, but not for an admiral--take it yourself, and send my  servant to me.\" C.C.

I knew very well a French Chevalier, who on coming to England, applied  himself with amazing ardour to the study of our language, and his  remarks upon it, if not always very acute were at least entertaining.  One day, reading aloud an English work, he stopped at the word SPLASH;  expressed himself highly delighted with it, as a term, which minutely  described the thing meant; then repeating it many times with marked  pleasure, and a strong sibillation, he added, \"No! no! dere is noting at  all, noting in _my_ language dat de same would be like _splash_!\"  Perhaps the following sentence from the satire of a notorious wit in  Elizabeth's reign, is a fair specimen of those expressive words which  _paint_, the object of which they speak:--\"To which place, Gabriel came,  _ruffling_ it out, hufty-tufty, in his new suit of velvet.\" The man was  vain; the writer has made him a _peacock_.
