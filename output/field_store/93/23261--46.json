If a Chinese traveler, during the middle  ages, inquiring into the history and religion of the western nations,  had confounded King Alfred with King Arthur, and both with Odin, he  would not have made a more preposterous confusion of names and  characters than that which has hitherto disguised the genuine  personality of the great Onondaga reformer. [Footnote: This subject is  further discussed in the Appendix, Note D.]    About the main events of his history, and about his character and  purposes, there can be no reasonable doubt. We have the wampum belts  which he handled, and whose simple hieroglyphics preserve the memory of  the public acts in which he took part. We have, also, in the Iroquois  \"Book of Rites,\" which in the present volume is given in its original  form, a still more clear and convincing testimony to the character both  of the legislator and of the people for whom his institutions were  designed. This book, sometimes called the \"Book of the Condoling  Council,\" might properly enough be styled an Iroquois Veda. It comprises  the speeches, songs, and other ceremonies, which, from the earliest  period of the confederacy, have composed the proceedings of their  council when a deceased chief is lamented and his successor is installed  in office. The fundamental laws of the league, a list of their ancient  towns, and the names of the chiefs who constituted their first council,  chanted in a kind of litany, are also comprised in the collection. The  contents, after being preserved in memory, like the Vedas, for many  generations, were written down by desire of the chiefs, when their  language was first reduced to writing; and the book is therefore more  than a century old. Its language, archaic when written, is now partly  obsolete, and is fully understood by only a few of the oldest chiefs. It  is a genuine Indian composition, and must be accepted as disclosing the  true character of its authors. The result is remarkable enough. Instead  of a race of rude and ferocious warriors, we find in this book a kindly  and affectionate people, full of sympathy for their friends in distress,  considerate to their women, tender to their children, anxious for peace,  and imbued with a profound reverence for their constitution and its  authors. We become conscious of the fact that the aspect in which these  Indians have presented themselves to the outside world has been in a  large measure deceptive and factitious. The ferocity, craft and cruelty,  which have been deemed their leading traits, have been merely the  natural accompaniments of wars of self-preservation, and no more  indicated their genuine character than the war-paint, plume and tomahawk  of the warrior displayed the customary guise in which he appeared among  his own people. The cruelties of war, when war is a struggle for  national existence, are common to all races. The persistent desire for  peace, pursued for centuries in federal unions, and in alliances and  treaties with other nations, has been manifested by few as steadily as  by the countrymen of Hiawatha. The sentiment of universal brotherhood  which directed their policy has never been so fully developed in any  branch of the Aryan race, unless it may be found incorporated in the  religious quietism of Buddha and his followers.          CHAPTER III.    THE BOOK OF RITES.      For a proper appreciation of this peculiar composition, some further  particulars respecting its origin and character will be needed. During  my earlier visits to the Reserve of the Six Nations, near Brantford, I  had heard of an Indian book which was used at their \"Condoling  Councils,\" the most important of their many public gatherings. But it  was not until the month of September, 1879, that I had an opportunity of  seeing the work. At that time two copies of the book were brought to me  by the official holders, two of the principal chiefs of the confederacy.  One of these was Chief John \"Smoke\" Johnson, who for many years had held  the high office of Speaker of the Great Council, though, of late,  yielding to age and infirmity, he has withdrawn from the public  performance of its duties. His second name is a rude rendering of his  truly poetical Indian appellation, Sakayen-gwaraton, or \"Disappearing  Mist.\" It signifies properly, I was told, the haze which rises from the  ground in an autumn morning and vanishes as the day advances. His  English name, and, in part, his blood, Chief Johnson derives from no  less distinguished an ancestor than Sir William Johnson, who played so  notable a part in colonial history during the last century, and who  exercised, perhaps, a greater influence on the destiny of the Iroquois  than any other individual since the formation of their confederacy. To  him, indeed, may be ascribed the distinction, such as it is, of  destroying the work which Hiawatha and Dekanawidah had founded. But for  the influence over the Indians which he had acquired, and was able to  bequeath to others, it is probable that the Six Nations would have  remained neutral during the Revolutionary War, and the disruption of  their League would not have taken place. Yet there can be no doubt that  he was sincerely attached to them, and desired their good. Unfortunately  for them, they held, as was natural, only the second place in his  affections. He was, by adoption, an Iroquois chief, but his first  allegiance was due to his native country, to whose interests, both in  the war with France and in the separation which he foresaw between  England and her colonies, he did not hesitate to sacrifice the welfare  of his red brethren. Against his subtle arts and overmastering energy  the wisest of their statesmen, worthy successors of the great founders  of their constitution, strove in vain, on each occasion, to maintain  that neutrality which was evidently the true policy of their people.  [Footnote: For the confirmation of these statements see the excellent  biographies of Sir William Johnson and Joseph Brant, by Wm. L. Stone,  _passim_.]    Sakayengwaraton is not an elected chief, nor does he bear one of the  hereditary titles of the Great Council, in which he holds so  distinguished a station. Indeed, his office is one unknown to the  ancient constitution of the Kanonsionni. It is the creation of the  British Government, to which he owes, with the willing consent of his  own people, his rank and position in the Council. The Provincial  administrators saw the need of a native official who should be, like the  Speaker of the English House of Commons, the mouthpiece of the Council,  and the intermediary between it and the representative of the Crown. The  grandson of Sir William Johnson was known as a brave warrior, a capable  leader, and an eloquent speaker. In the war of 1812, at the early age of  twenty, he had succeeded an elder brother in the command of the Indian  contingent, and had led his dusky followers with so much skill and  intrepidity as to elicit high praise from the English commander. His  eloquence was noted, even among a race of orators. I can well believe  what I have heard of its effects, as even in his old age, when an  occasion has for a moment aroused his spirit, I have not known whether  most to admire the nobleness and force of his sentiments and reasoning,  or the grace and flowing ease with which he delivered the stately  periods of his sonorous language. He has been a worthy successor of the  distinguished statesmen, Garagontieh, Garangula, Decanasora, Canasatego,  Logan, and others, who in former years guided the destinies of his  people. He is considered to have a better knowledge of the traditions  and ancient usages of the Six Nations than any other member of the  tribes, and is the only man now living who can tell the meaning of every  word of the \"Book of Rites.\"    The other chief to whom I have referred is the Onondaga Councillor who  is known to the whites as John Buck, but who bears in council the name  of Skanawati (\"Beyond the River\"), one of the fifty titular names which  have descended from the time of Hiawatha. He is the official keeper of  the \"wampum records\" of the confederacy, an important trust, which, to  his knowledge, has been in his family for at least four generations. His  rank, his character, and his eloquence make him now, virtually, the  Iroquois premier--an office which among the Six Nations, as among the  Athenians of old and the English of modern days, is both unknown to the  constitution and essential to its working. His knowledge of the legends  and customs of his people is only inferior to that of the more aged  Speaker of the Council.    The account which Chief J. S. Johnson gave me of the book may be briefly  told. The English missionaries reduced the Canienga language to writing  in the early part of the last century. The Jesuit fathers, indeed, had  learned and written the language--which they styled the Iroquois--fifty  years before; but it does not appear that they had instructed any of the  Indians in the art of writing it, as their successors in the Eastern  Province have since done. The English missionaries took pains to do  this. The liturgy of their church was printed in the Mohawk tongue, at  New York, as early as the year 1714. [Footnote: This date is given in  the preface to the Mohawk Prayer Book of 1787. This first version of the  liturgy was printed under the direction of the Rev. Wm. Andrews, the  missionary of the \"New England Society.\"] By the middle of the century  there were many members of the tribe who could write in the well-devised  orthography of the missionaries--an orthography which anticipated in  most points the well known \"Pickering alphabet,\" now generally' employed  in writing the Indian languages of North America. The chiefs of the  Great Council, at once conservative and quick to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#7)"],[1,"adam, to  accept them, it being impossible that a lady in this solitude  should not want assistance.'    'True, my lord,' replied Giauhara very sorrowfully, 'it is not a  little extraordinary for a lady of my rank to be in this situation.  I am a princess, daughter of the King of Samandal, and my name is  Giauhara. I was in my father's palace, when all of a sudden I heard  a dreadful noise: news was immediately brought me that King Saleh,  I know not for what reason, had forced his way into the palace,  seized the king my father, and murdered all the guards that made  any resistance. I had only time to save myself, and escaped hither  from his violence.'    At these words of the princess, King Beder began to be concerned  that he had quitted his grandmother so hastily, without staying to  hear from her an explanation of the news that had been brought her.  But he was, on the other hand, overjoyed to find that the king, his  uncle, had rendered himself master of the King of Samandal's  person, not doubting but that he would consent to give up the  princess for his liberty. 'Adorable princess,' continued he, 'your  concern is most just, but it is easy to put an end both to that and  to your father's captivity. You will agree with me when I tell you  that I am Beder, King of Persia, and King Saleh is my uncle; I  assure you, madam, he has no design to seize upon the king your  father's dominions; his only intent is to obtain his consent that I  may have the honour and happiness of being his son-in-law. I had  already given my heart to you, and now, far from repenting of what  I have done, I beg of you to be assured that I will love you as  long as I live. Permit me, then, beauteous princess! to have the  honour to go and present you to the king my uncle; and the king  your father shall no sooner have consented to our marriage, than  King Saleh will leave him sovereign of his dominions as before.'    This declaration of King Beder did not produce the effect he  expected. When the princess heard from his own mouth that he had  been the occasion of the ill-treatment her father had suffered, of  the grief and fright she had endured, and especially the necessity  she was reduced to of flying her country, she looked upon him as an  enemy with whom she ought to have nothing whatever to do.    King Beder, believing himself arrived at the very pinnacle of  happiness, stretched forth his hand, and taking that of the  princess' stooped down to kiss it, when she, pushing him back,  said, 'Wretch, quit that form of a man, and take that of a white  bird, with a red bill and feet.' Upon her pronouncing these words,  King Beder was immediately changed into a bird of that sort, to his  great surprise and mortification. 'Take him,' said she to one of  her women, 'and carry him to the Dry Island.' This island was only  one frightful rock, where there was not a drop of water to be had.    The waiting-woman took the bird, and in executing her princess's  orders had compassion on King Beder's destiny. 'It would be a great  pity,' said she to herself, 'to let a prince, so worthy to live,  die of hunger and thirst. The princess, so good and gentle, will,  it may be, repent of this cruel order when she comes to herself: it  were better that I carried him to a place where he may die a  natural death.' She accordingly carried him to a well-frequented  island, and left him in a charming plain, planted with all sorts of  fruit trees, and watered by several rivulets.    Let us return to King Saleh. After he had sought a good while for  the Princess Giauhara, and ordered others to seek for her, to no  purpose, he caused the King of Samandal to be shut up in his own  palace, under a strong guard; and having given the necessary orders  for governing the kingdom in his absence, he returned to give the  queen his mother an account of what he had done. The first thing he  asked upon his arrival was of the whereabouts of the king his  nephew, and he learned with great surprise and vexation that he had  disappeared.    'News being brought me,' said the queen, 'of the danger you were in  at the palace of the King of Samandal, whilst I was giving orders  to send other troops to avenge you, he disappeared. He must have  been frightened at hearing of your being in so great danger, and  did not think himself in sufficient safety with us.'    This news exceedingly afflicted King Saleh, who now repented of his  being so easily wrought upon by King Beder as to carry him away  with him without his mother's consent. Whilst he was in this  suspense about his nephew, he left his kingdom under the  administration of his mother, and went to govern that of the King  of Samandal, whom he continued to keep under great vigilance,  though with all due respect to his rank.    The same day that King Saleh returned to the kingdom of Samandal,  Queen Gulnare, mother to King Beder, arrived at the court of the  queen her mother. The princess was not at all surprised to find her  son did not return the same day he set out, it being not uncommon  for him to go further than he proposed in the heat of the chase;  but when she saw that he returned neither the next day, nor the day  after, she began to be alarmed. This alarm was increased when the  officers, who had accompanied the king, and were obliged to return  after they had for a long time sought in vain for both him and his  uncle, came and told her majesty they must of necessity have come  to some harm, or be together in some place which they could not  guess, since they could hear no tidings of them. Their horses,  indeed, they had found, but as for their persons, they knew not  where to look for them. The queen, hearing this, had resolved to  dissemble and conceal her affliction, bidding the officers to  search once more with their utmost diligence; but in the mean time,  saying nothing to anybody, she plunged into the sea, to satisfy  herself as to the suspicion she had that King Saleh must have  carried away his nephew along with him.    This great queen would have been more affectionately received by  the queen her mother, had she not, upon first sight of her, guessed  the occasion of her coming. 'Daughter,' said she, 'I plainly  perceive you are not come hither to visit me; you come to inquire  after the king your son; and the only news I can tell you will  augment both your grief and mine. I no sooner saw him arrive in our  territories, than I rejoiced; yet, when I came to understand he had  come away without your knowledge, I began to share with you the  concern you must needs feel.' Then she related to her with what  zeal King Saleh went to demand the Princess Giauhara in marriage  for King Beder, and what had happened, till her son disappeared. 'I  have sent diligently after him,' added she, 'and the king my son,  who is but just gone to govern the kingdom of Samandal, has done  all that lay in his power. All our endeavours have hitherto proved  unsuccessful, but we must hope nevertheless to see him again,  perhaps when we least expect it.'    Queen Gulnare was not satisfied with this hope; she looked upon the  king her dear son as lost, and lamented him bitterly, laying all  the blame upon the king his uncle. The queen her mother made her  consider the necessity of not yielding too much to her grief. 'The  king your brother,' said she, 'ought not, it is true, to have  talked to you so imprudently about that marriage, nor ever have  consented to carry away the king my grandson, without acquainting  you first; yet, since it is not certain that the King of Persia is  absolutely lost, you ought to neglect nothing to preserve his  kingdom for him: lose, then, no more time, but return to your  capital; your presence there will be necessary, and it will not be  hard for you to preserve the public peace, by causing it to be  published that the King of Persia was gone to visit his  grandmother.'    Queen Gulnare yielded. She took leave of the queen her mother, and  was back in the palace of the capital of Persia before she had been  missed. She immediately despatched persons to recall the officers  she had sent after the king, and to tell them she knew where his  majesty was, and that they should soon see him again. She also  governed with the prime minister and council as quietly as if the  king had been present.    To return to King Beder, whom the Princess Giauhara's waiting-woman  had carried and left in the island before mentioned; that monarch  was not a little surprised when he found himself alone, and under  the form of a bird. He felt yet more unhappy that he knew not where  he was, nor in what part of the world the kingdom of Persia lay. He  was forced to remain where he was, and live upon such food as birds  of his kind were wont to eat, and to pass the night on a tree.    A few days after, a peasant that was skilled in taking birds with  nets chanced to come to the place where he was; when perceiving so  fine a bird, the like of which he had never seen before, he began  greatly to rejoice. He employed all his art to catch him, and at  length succeeded. Overjoyed at so great a prize, which he looked  upon as of more worth than all the other birds, because so rare, he  shut it up in a cage, and carried it to the city. As soon as he was  come into the market, a citizen stops him, and asked him how much  he wanted for that bird.    Instead of answering, the peasant asked the citizen what he would  do with him in case he should buy him? 'What wouldst thou have me  to do with him,' answered the citizen, 'but roast and eat him?'    'If that be the case,' replied the peasant, 'I suppose you would  think me very well paid if you gave me the smallest piece of silver  for him. I set a much higher value upon him, and you should not  have him for a piece of gold. Although I am advanced in years, I  never saw such a bird in my life. I intend to make a present of him  to the king; he will know the value of him better than "]]]
