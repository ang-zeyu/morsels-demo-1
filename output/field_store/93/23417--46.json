When cool beat in yolk of an egg, if too  stiff add the beaten white.      DROP DUMPLINGS    Break into a cup the whites of three eggs; fill the cup with milk; put  it with a tablespoon of fresh butter and one cup of sifted flour in a  spider and stir as it boils until it leaves the spider clean. Set aside  until cool and stir in the yolks of three eggs. Season with salt, pepper  and nutmeg, mix thoroughly and drop by teaspoons in the boiling soup ten  minutes before ready to be served.      LIVER KLOESSE (DUMPLINGS)    Brown a small onion minced in one tablespoon of chicken fat, add a small  liver chopped fine, chopped parsley, two tablespoons of flour. Season  with nutmeg, red and white pepper, and add two eggs. Drop with teaspoon  in the boiling soup, let cook ten minutes--serve.      FRITTER BEANS    Beat one egg until light, add three-fourths teaspoon of salt, one-half  cup of flour and two tablespoons of water. Put through colander into  deep hot fat and fry until brown. Drain and pour hot broth over them.      SPONGE DUMPLINGS    Separate three eggs, beat the yolks, and add one cup of soup stock,  one-fourth teaspoon of salt, then add the beaten whites. Pour into a  greased cup and place in pan of hot water and steam until firm; cool,  remove from cup and cut into small dumplings with a teaspoon; pour the  boiling soup over and just before serving add chopped parsley.          *FISH*      Fish that is not fresh is a very dangerous food and great care should be  taken in selecting only fish fit to eat. If the fish is hard in body and  the eyes are clear and bright, the gills a bright red and slimy, the  flesh so firm that when pressed the marks of the fingers do not remain,  the scales not dry or easy to loosen, then the fish is fresh.    In the refrigerator fish will taint butter and other foods if placed in  the same compartment, so that in most cases it is better to lay it on a  plate on a pan of ice, or wrap it in parchment or waxed paper and put it  in the ice box.    Pickerel weighing more than five pounds should not be bought. If belly  is thick it is likely that there is another fish inside. This smaller  fish or any found in any other fish may not be used as food.    Salt fish should be soaked in fresh water, skin side up, to draw out the  salt.    Each fish is at its best in its season, for instance:--    Bluefish, Butterfish, Sea, Striped Bass, Porgies, Sea-trout or Weakfish  are best from April to September.    Fluke and Flounders are good all year round, but the fluke is better  than the flounder in summer. Carp may be had all year, but care must be  taken that it has not been in polluted water.    Cod, Haddock, Halibut, Mackerel, Redsnapper, Salmon, Whitefish are good  all year.    In the different states of the United States there are laws governing  the fishing for trout, so the season for that fish differs in the  various states.    Black Bass, Perch, Pickerel and Pike are in season from June 1st to  December 1st.    Shad, April to June.    Smelts, November 10th to April.      TO CLEAN FISH    The fish may be cleaned at the market, but needs to be looked over  carefully before cooking.    To remove the scales hold the fish by the tail and scrape firmly toward  the head with a small sharp knife, held with the blade slanting toward  the tail. Scrape slowly so that the scales will not fly, and rinse the  knife frequently in cold water. If the fish is to be served whole, leave  the head and tail on and trim the fins; otherwise remove them.      TO OPEN FISH    To open small fish cut under the gills and squeeze out the contents by  pressing upward from the middle with the thumb and finger. To open large  fish split them from the gills halfway down the body toward the tail;  remove the entrails and scrape and clean, opening far enough to remove  all the blood from the backbone, and wiping the inside thoroughly with a  cloth wrung out of cold, salted water.      TO SKIN FISH    To skin a fish remove the fins along the back and cut off a narrow strip  of the skin the entire length of the back. Then slip the knife under the  skin that lies over the bony part of the gills and work slowly toward  the tail. Do the same with the other side.      TO BONE FISH    To bone a fish clean it first and remove the head. Then, beginning at  the tail, run a sharp knife under the flesh close to the bone, scraping  the flesh away clean from the bone. Work up one side toward the head;  then repeat the same process on the other side of the bone. Lift the  bone carefully and pull out any small bones that may be left in the  flesh.      BOILED FISH    To cook fish properly is very important, as no food, perhaps, is so  insipid as fish if carelessly cooked. It must be well done and properly  salted. A good rule to cook fish by is the following: Allow ten minutes  to the first pound and five minutes for each additional pound; for  example: boil a fish weighing five pounds thirty minutes. By pulling out  a fin you may ascertain whether your fish is done; if it comes out  easily and the meat is an opaque white, your fish has boiled long  enough. Always set your fish on to boil in hot water, hot from the  teakettle, adding salt and a dash of vinegar to keep the meat firm; an  onion, a head of celery and parsley roots are always an acceptable  flavor to any kind of boiled fish, no matter what kind of sauce you  intend to serve with the fish. If you wish to serve the fish whole, tie  it in a napkin and lay it on an old plate at the bottom of the kettle;  if you have a regular \"fish kettle\" this is not necessary. In boiling  fish avoid using too much water.    To thicken sauces, where flour is used, take a level teaspoon of flour  to a cup of sauce, or the yolk of an egg to a cup of sauce.      BAKED FISH    Wash and dry the fish, rubbing inside and outside with salt; stuff with  a bread stuffing and sew. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a  hot oven without water. As soon as it begins to brown add hot water and  butter and baste every ten minutes. Bake until done, allowing an hour or  more for a large fish, twenty or thirty minutes for a small one. Remove  to a hot platter; draw out the strings; garnish with slices of lemon  well covered with chopped parsley and serve with Hollandaise sauce.      BROILED FISH    For broiling, large fish should be split down the back and head and tail  removed; salmon and halibut should be cut into one-inch slices, and  smelts and other small fish left whole. Wipe the fish as dry as  possible; sprinkle with salt and pepper and if the fish is dry and white  brush the flesh side well with olive oil or butter. Put in a  well-greased broiler, placing the thickest parts of the fish toward the  middle or back of the broiler. Hold over a hot fire until the flesh side  is nicely browned; then cook the skin side just long enough to make the  skin crisp. Small fish require from ten to fifteen minutes, large fish  from fifteen to twenty-five. To remove from the broiler loosen one side  first, then the other, and lift carefully with a cake turner. Place on a  platter; spread with butter and stand in the oven for a few minutes.  Garnish with lemon and serve with Maitre d'Hotel butter.      JEWISH METHOD OF FRYING FISH    Scale the fish with the utmost thoroughness, remove the entrails, wash  very thoroughly, and salt both inside and out. Then cut the fish into  convenient slices, place them on a strainer and leave them there for an  hour.    Meanwhile, place some flour in one plate and some beaten eggs in  another, and heat a large frying-pan half full of oil or butter. Now  wipe your fish slices thoroughly with a clean cloth, dip them first in  flour and then in beaten eggs and finally fry until browned.    In frying fish very hot oil is required. If a crumb of bread will brown  in twenty seconds the oil is hot enough. Put fish in a frying basket,  then into the hot oil and cook five minutes. Drain on brown paper and  arrange on platter. Do not stick knife or fork into fish while it is  frying.    When the oil has cooled, strain it, pour it into a jar, cover it and it  will be ready for use another time. It can be used again for fish only.      ANOTHER METHOD OF FRYING FISH    Thoroughly mix six ounces of flour with an ounce of olive oil, the yolk  of an egg, and a pinch of salt. Stir in one gill of tepid water and  allow the whole to stand for half an hour in a cool place. Next beat the  white of an egg stiff and stir into the batter. Dip each fish into the  mixture, then roll in bread crumbs and cook in boiling oil. Butter must  not be used. In frying fish do not allow the fish to remain in the  spider after it has been nicely browned, for this absorbs the fat and  destroys the delicate flavor. Be sure that the fish is done. This rule  applies to fish that is sauted.      SAUTED FISH    Clean fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in flour or cornmeal and  cook in spider with just enough hot butter to prevent it sticking to the  pan. Shake the pan occasionally. Brown well on under side, then turn and  brown on the other side.      LEMON FISH    Boil three tablespoons of vinegar, one sliced onion, six whole peppers,  salt, one piece of stick cinnamon, and a little water, then add sliced  fish. When fish has boiled twenty minutes remove and arrange on platter.  Strain the gravy and add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, juice of two  lemons, sugar to taste and twelve grated almonds. Let all come to a  boil, then pour over the fish, sprinkle finely chopped parsley on top  and garnish with sliced lemons. Bluefish, mackerel, shad, salmon and  porgies may be cooked with this sauce.      SWEET SOUR FISH    First cut up and salt the fish. Shad, trout or carp can be used.

But  divine wisdom, i. e., Reason, is one and the same in the great as in the  little; and we must not imagine God to be too weak to exercise his  wisdom on the grand scale. Our intellectual striving aims at realizing  the conviction that what was intended by eternal wisdom is actually  accomplished in the domain of existent, active Spirit, as well as in  that of mere Nature. Our mode of treating the subject is, in this  aspect, a Theodicaea--a justification of the ways of God--which Leibnitz  attempted metaphysically in his method, i. e., in indefinite abstract  categories--so that the ill that is found in the world may be  comprehended, and the thinking Spirit reconciled with the fact of the  existence of evil. Indeed, nowhere is such a harmonizing view more  pressingly demanded than in universal history; and it can be attained  only by recognizing the positive existence, in which that negative  element is a subordinate and vanquished nullity. On the one hand, the  ultimate design of the world must be perceived, and, on the other, the  fact that this design has been actually realized in it, and that evil  has not been able permanently to establish a rival position. But this  conviction involves much more than the mere belief in a superintending  [GREEK: nous] or in \"Providence.\" \"Reason,\" whose sovereignty over the  world has been maintained, is as indefinite a term as \"Providence,\"  supposing the term to be used by those who are unable to characterize it  distinctly, to show wherein it consists, so as to enable us to decide  whether a thing is rational or irrational. An adequate definition of  Reason is the first desideratum; and whatever boast may be made of  strict adherence to it in explaining phenomena, without such a  definition we get no farther than mere words. With these observations we  may proceed to the second point of view that has to be considered in  this Introduction.    2. The inquiry into the essential destiny of Reason, as far as it is  considered in reference to the world, is identical with the question  _What is the ultimate design of the world?_ And the expression implies  that that design is destined to be realized. Two points of consideration  suggest themselves: first, the _import_ of this design--its abstract  definition; secondly, its _realization_.    It must be observed at the outset that the phenomenon we  investigate--universal history--belongs to the realm of \"spirit.\" The  term \"World\" includes both physical and psychical nature. Physical  nature also plays its part in the world's history, and attention will  have to be paid to the fundamental natural relations thus involved. But  Spirit, and the course of its development, is our substantial object.  Our task does not require us to contemplate nature as a rational system  in itself--though in its own proper domain it proves itself such-but  simply in its relation to _Spirit_. On the stage on which we are  observing it--universal history--Spirit displays itself in its most  concrete reality. Notwithstanding this (or rather for the very purpose  of comprehending the general principles which this, its form of concrete  reality, embodies) we must premise some abstract characteristics of the  nature of Spirit.    We have therefore to mention here      (1) The abstract characteristics of the nature of    Spirit.      (2) What means Spirit uses in order to realize its    Idea.      (3) Lastly, we must consider the shape which the    perfect embodiment of Spirit assumes--the    State.    (1) The nature of Spirit may be understood by a glance at its direct  opposite--Matter. As the essence of Matter is gravity, so, on the other  hand, we may affirm that the substance, the essence of Spirit is freedom.  All will readily assent to the doctrine that Spirit, among other  properties, is also endowed with freedom; but philosophy teaches that  all the qualities of Spirit exist only through freedom; that all are but  means for attaining freedom; that all seek and produce this and this  alone. It is a result of speculative philosophy that freedom is the sole  truth of Spirit. Matter possesses gravity in virtue of its tendency toward  a central point. It is essentially composite, consisting of parts that  _exclude_ one another. It seeks its unity; and therefore exhibits itself  as self-destructive, as verging toward its opposite--an indivisible point.  If it could attain this, it would be Matter no longer; it would have  perished. It strives after the realization of its Idea; for in unity it  exists ideally. Spirit, on the contrary, may be defined as that which has  its centre in itself. It has not a unity outside itself, but has already  found it; it exists in and with itself. Matter has its essence out of  itself; Spirit is self-contained existence (Bei-sich-selbst-seyn). Now  this is freedom, exactly. For if I am dependent, my being is referred to  something else which I am not; I cannot exist independently of something  external. I am free, on the contrary, when my existence depends upon  myself. This self-contained existence of Spirit is none other than  self-consciousness-consciousness of one's own being. Two things must be  distinguished in consciousness; first, the fact _that I know_;  secondly, _what I know_. In self-consciousness these are merged in  one; for Spirit knows itself. It involves an appreciation of its own  nature, as also an energy enabling it to realize itself; to make itself  actually what it is potentially. According to this abstract definition it  may be said of universal history that it is the exhibition of Spirit in  the process of working out the knowledge of that which it is potentially.  And as the germ bears in itself the whole nature of the tree and the taste  and form of its fruits, so do the first traces of Spirit virtually contain  the whole of that history. The Orientals have not attained the knowledge  that Spirit--Man _as such_--is free; and because they do not know  this, they are not free. They only know that one is free; but on this  very account, the freedom of that one is only caprice; ferocity--brutal  recklessness of passion, or a mildness and tameness of the desires, which  is itself only an accident of nature--is mere caprice like the former.  That _one_ is therefore only a despot, not a _free man_. The  consciousness of freedom first arose among the Greeks, and therefore they  were free; but they, and the Romans likewise, knew only that _some_ are  free, not man as such. Even Plato and Aristotle did not know this. The  Greeks, therefore, had slaves, and their whole life and the maintenance  of their splendid liberty was implicated with the institution of  slavery--a fact, moreover, which made that liberty, on the one hand,  only an accidental, transient and limited growth, and on the other, a  rigorous thraldom of our common nature--of the Human. The Germanic  nations, under the influence of Christianity, were the first to attain  the consciousness that man is free; that it is the freedom of Spirit  which constitutes its essence. This consciousness arose first in  religion, the inmost region of Spirit; but to introduce the principle  into the various relations of the actual world involves a more extensive  problem than its simple implantation--a problem whose solution and  application require a severe and lengthened process of culture. In  proof of this we may note that slavery did not cease immediately on the  reception of Christianity. Still less did liberty predominate in States;  or governments and constitutions adopt a rational organization, or  recognize freedom as their basis. That application of the principle to  political relations, the thorough molding and interpenetration of the  constitution of society by it, is a process identical with history  itself. I have already directed attention to the distinction here  involved, between a principle as such and its application--that is, its  introduction and fulfilment in the actual phenomena of Spirit and life.  This is a point of fundamental importance in our science, and one which  must be constantly respected as essential. And in the same way as this  distinction has attracted attention in view of the Christian principle  of self-consciousness--freedom, it also shows itself as an essential one  in view of the principle of freedom generally. The history of the world  is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom--progress  whose development, according to the necessity of its nature, it is our  business to investigate.    The general statement given above of the various grades in the  consciousness of freedom-which we applied in the first instance to the  fact that the Eastern nations knew only that one is free, the Greek and  Roman world only that _some_ are free, while we know that all men  absolutely (man as man) are free--supplies us with the natural division  of universal history, and suggests the mode of its discussion. This is  remarked, however, only incidentally and anticipatively; some other  ideas must be first explained.    The destiny of the spiritual world, and--since this is the substantial  world, while the physical remains subordinate to it, or, in the language  of speculation, has no truth as against the spiritual--the final cause  of the world at large we allege to be the consciousness of its own  freedom on the part of Spirit, and, _ipso facto_, the reality of that  freedom. But that this term \"freedom\" is, without further  qualification, an indefinite, incalculable, ambiguous term, and that,  while what it represents is the _ne plus ultra_ of attainment, it is  liable to an infinity of misunderstandings, confusions, and errors, and  to become the occasion for all imaginable excesses--has never been more  clearly known and felt than in modern times. Yet, for the present, we  must content ourselves with the term itself without further definition.  Attention was also"]]]
