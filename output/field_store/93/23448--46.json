Several packhorses were  also attached to the party. I had been induced to prefer wheel carriages  for an exploratory journey: first, From the level nature of the interior  country; second, From the greater facility and certainty they afforded of  starting early, and as the necessity for laying all our stores in  separate loads on animals' backs could thus be avoided. The latter method  being further exposed to interruptions on the way--by the derangement of  loads--or galling the animals' backs--one inexperienced man being thus  likely to impede the progress of the whole party.    For the navigation or passage of rivers, two portable boats of canvas,  had been prepared by Mr. Eager, of the King's dockyard at Sydney. We  carried the canvas only, with models of the ribs--and tools, having  carpenters who could complete them, as occasions required.    Our hour for encamping, when circumstances permitted, was to be two P.M.,  as affording time for the cattle to feed and rest, but this depended on  our finding water and grass. Daybreak was to be the signal for preparing  for the journey, and no time was allowed for breakfast, until after the  party had encamped for the day.    As we proceeded along the road leading to the pass in the Liverpool  range, Mr. White overtook us, having obtained an additional supply of  flour, tobacco, tea and sugar, with which Mr. Finch was to follow the  party as soon as he could procure the carts and bullocks necessary for  the carriage of these stores.    BURNING GRASS.    After travelling six hours, we encamped beside a small watercourse near  Mussel Brook, the thermometer at four P.M. being as high as 95 degrees.  In the evening, the burning grass became rather alarming, especially as  we had a small stock of ammunition in one of the carts. I had established  our camp to the windward of the burning grass, but I soon discovered that  the progress of the fire was against the wind, especially where the grass  was highest. This may appear strange, but it is easily accounted for. The  extremities of the stalks bending from the wind, are the first to catch  the flame, but as they become successively ignited, the fire runs  directly to the windward, which is toward the lower end of the spikes of  grass, and catching the extremities of other stalks still further in the  direction of the wind, it travels in a similar manner along them. We  managed to extinguish the burning grass before it reached our encampment,  but to prevent the invasion of such a dangerous enemy we took the  precaution, on other occasions, of burning a sufficient space around our  tents in situations where we were exposed to like inconvenience and  danger.    ABORIGINES AND COLONISTS.    December 1, 6 A.M.    The thermometer at 82 degrees. As the party proceeded, the sky became  overcast, and the absence of the sun made the day much more agreeable.  Towards noon we had rain and thunder, and this weather continued until we  reached the banks of the Hunter. We forded the river where the stream was  considerable at the time, and then encamped on the left bank. The draught  animals appeared less fatigued by this journey, than they had been by  that of the former day, owing probably to the refreshing moisture and  cooler air. After the tents had been pitched, a fine invigorating breeze  arose, and the weather cleared up. Segenhoe, the extensive estate of  Potter Macqueen, Esquire was not far distant, and Mr. Sempill the agent,  called at my tent, and afforded me some aid in completing my  arrangements.    I was very anxious to obtain the assistance of an aboriginal guide, but  the natives had almost all disappeared from the valley of the Hunter; and  those who still linger near their ancient haunts, are sometimes met with,  about such large establishments as Segenhoe, where, it may be presumed,  they meet with kind treatment. Their reckless gaiety of manner;  intelligence respecting the country, expressed in a laughable inversion  of slang words; their dexterity, and skill in the use of their weapons;  and above all, their few wants, generally ensure them that look of  welcome,* without which these rovers of the wild will seldom visit a farm  or cattle station. Among those, who have become sufficiently acquainted  with us, to be sensible of that happy state of security, enjoyed by all  men under the protection of our laws, the conduct is strikingly different  from that of the natives who remain in a savage state. The latter are  named myalls, by their half-civilised brethren--who, indeed, hold them so  much in dread, that it is seldom possible to prevail on anyone to  accompany a traveller far into the unexplored parts of the country. At  Segenhoe, on a former occasion, I met with a native but recently arrived  from the wilds. His terror and suspicion, when required to stand steadily  before me, while I drew his portrait, were such, that, notwithstanding  the power of disguising fear, so remarkable in the savage race, the stout  heart of Cambo was overcome, and beat visibly--the perspiration streamed  from his breast, and he was about to sink to the ground, when he at  length suddenly darted from my presence; but he speedily returned,  bearing in one hand his club, and in the other his boomerang, with which  he seemed to acquire just fortitude enough, to be able to stand on his  legs, until I finished the sketch (See Plate 1.1.)    (*Footnote. They understand our looks better than our speech.)    A COLONIST.    December 2.    The party moved off at seven, and passing, soon after, near the farm of  an old man, whom I had assisted some years before, in the selection of  his land, I rode to see him, accompanied by Mr. White. He was busy with  his harvest, but left the top of his wheat-stack on seeing me, and  running up, cordially welcomed us to his dwelling. A real scotch bonnet  covered the brow of a face which reminded me, by its characteristic  carving, of the land of the mountain and the flood. The analogy between  the respective features, was at least so strong in my mind, and the sight  of the one was so associated with the idea of the other, that had I seen  this face on a stranger, in a still more distant corner of the earth--it  must have called to mind the hills of my native land. The old man was  very deaf, but in spite of age and this infirmity his sharp blue eye  expressed the enduring vigour of his mind. He had buried his wife in  Scotland, and had left there a numerous family, that he might become its  pioneer at the antipodes. He had thus far worked his way successfully,  and was beginning to reap the fruits of his adventurous industry. Sleek  cattle filled his stockyard, his fields waved with ripe grain, and I had  the satisfaction of learning from him, that he had written for his  family, and that he soon expected their arrival in the colony. He  immediately gave grain to our horses, and placed before us new milk; and,  what we found a still greater luxury, pure water from the running burnie  close by; also a bottle of the mountain dew, which, he said, was from a  still which was no far aff. When I was about to mount my horse, he  enquired if I could spare five minutes more, when he put into my hands  the copy of a long memorial addressed to the government, which he had  taken from among the leaves of a very old folio volume of Pitscottie's  History of Scotland. This memorial prayed, that whereas Scoone was in the  valley of Strathearne, and that the pillow of Jacob which had been kept  as the coronation stone of the Kings of Scotland, was fated still to be,  where their dominion extended; and as this valley of the Kingdon Ponds,  had not received a general name, that it might be called Strathearne,  etc. etc. We were finally compelled, although it still wanted two hours  of noon, to drink a stirrup-cup at the door--when he most heartily drank  success to our expedition, and I went on my way rejoicing that, on  leaving the last man of the white race we were likely to see for some  time, the ceremony of shaking hands was a vibration of sincere kindness.    We soon overtook the party--and had proceeded with it, some distance,  when a soldier of the mounted police came up, and delivered to me a  letter, from the military secretary at Sydney, informing me by command of  the Acting Governor, that George Clarke--alias The Barber (The  Bushranger) had sawed off his irons, and escaped from the prison at  Bathurst. This intelligence was meant to put me on my guard respecting  the natives, for from the well-known character of the man, it was  supposed, that he would assemble them beyond the settled districts, with  a view to drive off the cattle of the colonists--and especial caution  would be necessary to prevent a surprise from natives so directed, if, as  most people supposed, his story of the great river, had only been an  invention of his own, by which he had hoped to improve his chance of  escape. (See Appendix 1.1.)    BURNING HILL OF WINGEN.    At three P.M. we reached a spot favourable for encamping, the Kingdon  brook forming a broad pool, deep enough to bathe in, and the grass in the  neighbourhood being very good. The burning hill of Wingen was distant  about four miles. This phenomenon appears to be of the same character as  that at Holworth, in the neighbourhood of Weymouth, described by  Professor Buckland and Mr. De la Beche in the following terms: \"It is  probable that in each case rainwater acting on iron pyrites has set fire  to the bituminous shale; thus ignited it has gone on burning at Holworth  unto the present hour, and may still continue smouldering for a long  series of years, the bitumen being here so abundant in some strata of the  shale, that it is burnt as fuel in the adjoining cottages; the same  bituminous shale is used as fuel in the village of Kimmeridge, and is  there called Kimmeridge coal.\"* Wingen, the aboriginal name, is derived  from fire.

Near the centre of the  sound is a small, dark-coloured, rocky island.\"    Sept. 2. In the afternoon, captain Edwards passed out to the northward,  with his little squadron, from amongst the Prince of Wales' Islands; and  the same evening, by steering westward, cleared all the islands and reefs  of Torres' Strait: on the 14th he reached Timor.    The track and discoveries of the Pandora, in Plate XIII. are taken from a  chart published in 1798, by Mr. Dalrymple, upon the authority of one  constructed by lieutenant Hayward; but it does not contain the track of  the boats after the loss of the Pandora. This chart, and the account  given by Mr. Hamilton, which, though more than sufficiently explicit upon  some points, is very defective in what concerns navigation and geography;  are all that appears to have been published of this voyage.    BLIGH and PORTLOCK. 1792.    Neither the great extent of the reefs, to the eastward of Cape York, nor  the loss of the Pandora, were known in 1792; when captain WILLIAm BLIGH  came a second time to Torres' Strait, with His Majesty's ship  _Providence_, and the brig _Assistant_ commanded by lieutenant (now  captain) NATHANIEL PORTLOCK. The objects of his mission were, to  transport the bread-fruit plant from Taheity to the West Indies; and, in  his way, to explore a new passage through the Strait; in both of which he  was successful.    A chart of the discoveries made in Torres' Strait, was lodged, by captain  Bligh, in the Admiralty Office; and is incorporated with other  authorities, in Plate XIII. of the accompanying Atlas. No account of this  voyage having yet been published; it is conceived, that the following  brief relation of the passage through the strait, will be acceptable to  the nautical reader; and, having had the honour to serve in the  expedition, I am enabled to give it from my own journal, with the  sanction of captain Bligh.    Aug. 31. Latitude at noon 9 deg. 25' south; longitude from fifteen sets of  distances of the sun west, and star east, of the moon, taken on the 24th,  25th, and 26th, preceding, 145 deg. 22' and by time keepers, 145 deg. 23' east.  No land seen since passing _Louisiade_ the preceding day; but many birds  and fish, and much rock weed. At dusk, having steered W. 1/4 S. 27 miles,  breakers were seen ahead, at the distance of two miles; and the vessels  hauled to the wind: no bottom at 94 fathoms.    Sept. 1. They bore away W. by S.; but hauled up gradually to South, on  account of the breakers; and not being able to weather them, tacked to  the N. E. At noon, latitude 9 deg. 37' south, longitude by time keepers, 144 deg.  59' east:* part of the reef, which was named after captain Portlock, seen  in the N. N. W. from the mast head. At four o'clock, the vessels edged  away round the north end of _Portlock's Reef_, which, at dusk, bore  South, about two leagues; and the wind was then hauled for the night.    [* In Plate XIII. some small alterations are made in the longitudes given  by captain Bligh's time keepers, to make them correspond with the  corrected longitudes of the Investigator and Cumberland.]    Sept. 2. The breakers bore South, four or five miles; and captain Bligh  steered westward: the Assistant leading. At noon, the latitude being 9 deg.  26', longitude, by time keepers, 144 deg. 23', other breakers were seen  ahead, and the vessels hauled the wind to the southward; but finding  another reef in that direction, with a dry bank upon it, they tacked to  the N. E. at half past one; and got ground, for the first time, in 64  fathoms, coral bottom. During the following night, they stood off and on,  constantly getting soundings.    No breakers were in sight in the morning of Sept. 3. At seven, a boat was  sent ahead; and the vessels bore away after her to the N. W., in order to  try the New-Guinea side of the Strait. At noon, their course was  interrupted by a reef, which was named _Bonds Reef_, extending from W. N.  W. to North, and distant four or five miles: observed latitude 9 deg. 6',  longitude 144 deg. 13'. The north side of the Strait being judged  impracticable, the wind was again hauled to the southward; and, at dusk,  the vessels anchored in 37 fathoms, fine grey sand; five or six miles  north of a reef, upon which was a dry bank, called _Anchor Key_. An  island of considerable height, bearing S. W. by W. ten leagues, was then  seen from the mast head: Captain Bligh gave it the name of _Darnley's  Island_; and to the space between Portlock's and Bond's Reefs, by which  the vessels had entered the Strait, that of _Bligh's Entrance_.    Sept. 4. A boat was sent to the S. S. W., and the vessels followed. Other  high lands (_Murray's Isles_) were seen to the southward; and a reef with  a sand bank on it, to the west. At noon, the latitude was 9 deg. 32' south,  and longitude 143 deg. 59' east: Darnley's Island bore S. 74 deg. to 82 deg. W., four  leagues; and the largest of Murray's Isles, S. 13 deg. to 21 deg. E.: the western  reef was about three miles distant, but nothing was visible ahead in the  S. by W. At four o'clock, the vessels anchored in 21 fathoms, sandy  bottom; with Darnley's Island bearing N. 60 deg. W., three leagues. Betwixt a  sand-bank, called _Canoe Key_, which bore S. 60 deg. W., two leagues, and a  reef lying in the W. by S., there appeared to be a passage, which the  boats were sent to examine.    On the 5th, boats were again sent to sound the passage. Several large  sailing canoes were seen; and the cutter making the signal for  assistance, the pinnace was sent to her, well manned and armed. On the  return of the boats in the afternoon, it appeared, that, of four canoes  which used their efforts to get up to the cutter, one succeeded. There  were in it fifteen Indians, black, and quite naked; and they made signs  which were interpreted to be amicable. These signs the officer imitated;  but not thinking it prudent to go so near as to take a green cocoa-nut,  which was held up to him, he continued rowing for the ship. A man, who  was sitting upon the shed erected in the centre of the canoe, then said  something to those below; and immediately they began to string their  bows. Two of them had already fitted arrows, when the officer judged it  necessary to fire in his own defence. Six muskets were discharged; and  the Indians fell flat into the bottom of the canoe, all except the man on  the shed: the seventh musket was fired at him, and he fell also. During  this time, the canoe dropped astern; and the three others having joined  her, they all gave chase to the cutter, trying to cut her off from the  ship; in which they would probably have succeeded, had not the pinnace  arrived, at that juncture, to her assistance. The Indians then hoisted  their sails, and steered for Darnley's Island.    No boats could have been manoeuvred better, in working to windward, than  were these long canoes by the naked savages. Had the four been able to  reach the cutter, it is difficult to say, whether the superiority of our  arms would have been equal to the great difference of numbers;  considering the ferocity of these people, and the skill with which they  seemed to manage their weapons.    September 6. Two boats were sent ahead; and the vessels followed them,  between Canoe Key and the reef lying from it half a mile to the north.  After running twelve miles beyond this narrow pass, they anchored in 13  fathoms; the latitude being 9 deg. 37', and longitude 143 deg. 41'. In the  afternoon, they proceeded five miles further, to the N. N. W.; and  Darnley's Island then bore S. 74 deg. to 55 deg. E. two leagues: except on the  north side, this island appeared to be surrounded with reefs and sand  banks to a considerable distance. In sailing from Canoe Key, the vessels  had left, on the larbord hand, a long chain of reefs and banks; at the  north-west end of which, were three low, woody islands: the nearest of  these, bearing S. 41 deg. W. two or three miles from the anchorage, was named  _Nepean Island_. The view to the northward, from W. by N. to E. by S.,  was free from dangers; but in every other direction there were reefs,  islands, or dry banks.    This day, several canoes from Darnley's Island came off to both vessels.  On approaching, the Indians clapped upon their heads, and exclaimed  _Whou! Whou! Whoo!_ repeatedly, with much vehemence; at the same time,  they held out arrows and other weapons, and asked for _toore-tooree_! by  which they meant iron.* After much difficulty, they were persuaded to  come along-side; and two men ventured into the ship. They had bushy  hair--were rather stout made--and nearly answered the description given  of the natives of New Guinea.** The cartilage, between the nostrils, was  cut away in both these people; and the lobes of their ears slit, and  stretched to a great length, as had before been observed in a native of  the _Fejee Islands_. They had no kind of clothing; but wore necklaces of  cowrie shells, fastened to a braid of fibres; and some of their  companions had pearl-oyster shells hung round their necks. In speaking to  each other, their words seemed to be distinctly pronounced.    [* The name for iron at Taheity, is _eure-euree_, or _ooree_, orj,  according to Bougainville, _aouri_.]    [** See _a Voyage to New Guinea_, by Captain Thomas Forrest.]    Their arms were bows, arrows, and clubs, which they bartered for every  kind"]]]
