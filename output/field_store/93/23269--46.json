Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom  In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds  This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav'n.  I then was of the lambs, that Dominic  Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,  Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.  He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,  And master to me: Albert of Cologne  Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.  If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd,  Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,  In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.  That next resplendence issues from the smile  Of Gratian, who to either forum lent  Such help, as favour wins in Paradise.  The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,  Was Peter, he that with the widow gave  To holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,  Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,  That all your world craves tidings of its doom:  Within, there is the lofty light, endow'd  With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,  That with a ken of such wide amplitude  No second hath arisen.  Next behold  That taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,  Clearliest, the nature and the ministry  Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.  In the other little light serenely smiles  That pleader for the Christian temples, he  Who did provide Augustin of his lore.  Now, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,  Upon my praises following, of the eighth  Thy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that shows  The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,  Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,  Blest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lie  Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom  And exile came it here.  Lo! further on,  Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,  Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,  In deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whom  Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam  Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,  Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.  It is the eternal light of Sigebert,  Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,  Reading in the straw-litter'd street.\"  Forthwith,  As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God  To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,  Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,  Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,  Affection springs in well-disposed breast;  Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard  Voice answ'ring voice, so musical and soft,  It can be known but where day endless shines.          CANTO XI    O fond anxiety of mortal men!  How vain and inconclusive arguments  Are those, which make thee beat thy wings below  For statues one, and one for aphorisms  Was hunting; this the priesthood follow'd, that  By force or sophistry aspir'd to rule;  To rob another, and another sought  By civil business wealth; one moiling lay  Tangled in net of sensual delight,  And one to witless indolence resign'd;  What time from all these empty things escap'd,  With Beatrice, I thus gloriously  Was rais'd aloft, and made the guest of heav'n.    They of the circle to that point, each one.  Where erst it was, had turn'd; and steady glow'd,  As candle in his socket.  Then within  The lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling  With merer gladness, heard I thus begin:    \"E'en as his beam illumes me, so I look  Into the eternal light, and clearly mark  Thy thoughts, from whence they rise.  Thou art in doubt,  And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh  In such plain open phrase, as may be smooth  To thy perception, where I told thee late  That 'well they thrive;' and that 'no second such  Hath risen,' which no small distinction needs.    \"The providence, that governeth the world,  In depth of counsel by created ken  Unfathomable, to the end that she,  Who with loud cries was 'spous'd in precious blood,  Might keep her footing towards her well-belov'd,  Safe in herself and constant unto him,  Hath two ordain'd, who should on either hand  In chief escort her: one seraphic all  In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,  The other splendour of cherubic light.  I but of one will tell: he tells of both,  Who one commendeth which of them so'er  Be taken: for their deeds were to one end.    \"Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls  From blest Ubaldo's chosen hill, there hangs  Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold  Are wafted through Perugia's eastern gate:  And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear  Mourn for their heavy yoke.  Upon that side,  Where it doth break its steepness most, arose  A sun upon the world, as duly this  From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak  Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name  Were lamely so deliver'd; but the East,  To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl'd.  He was not yet much distant from his rising,  When his good influence 'gan to bless the earth.  A dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gate  More than to death, was, 'gainst his father's will,  His stripling choice: and he did make her his,  Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,  And in his father's sight: from day to day,  Then lov'd her more devoutly.  She, bereav'd  Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,  Thousand and hundred years and more, remain'd  Without a single suitor, till he came.  Nor aught avail'd, that, with Amyclas, she  Was found unmov'd at rumour of his voice,  Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness  Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,  When Mary stay'd beneath.  But not to deal  Thus closely with thee longer, take at large  The rovers' titles--Poverty and Francis.  Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,  And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,  So much, that venerable Bernard first  Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace  So heavenly, ran, yet deem'd his footing slow.  O hidden riches!  O prolific good!  Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,  And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride  Can please them.  Thenceforth goes he on his way,  The father and the master, with his spouse,  And with that family, whom now the cord  Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart  Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son  Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men  In wond'rous sort despis'd.  But royally  His hard intention he to Innocent  Set forth, and from him first receiv'd the seal  On his religion.  Then, when numerous flock'd  The tribe of lowly ones, that trac'd HIS steps,  Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung  In heights empyreal, through Honorius' hand  A second crown, to deck their Guardian's virtues,  Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath'd: and when  He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up  In the proud Soldan's presence, and there preach'd  Christ and his followers; but found the race  Unripen'd for conversion: back once more  He hasted (not to intermit his toil),  And reap'd Ausonian lands.  On the hard rock,  'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ  Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years  Did carry.  Then the season come, that he,  Who to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'd  T' advance him to the meed, which he had earn'd  By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,  As their just heritage, he gave in charge  His dearest lady, and enjoin'd their love  And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'd  His goodly spirit should move forth, returning  To its appointed kingdom, nor would have  His body laid upon another bier.    \"Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,  To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea  Helm'd to right point; and such our Patriarch was.  Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,  Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in.  But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,  So that they needs into strange pastures wide  Must spread them: and the more remote from him  The stragglers wander, so much mole they come  Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.  There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,  And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,  A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.    \"Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta'en  Good heed, if that, which I have told, recall  To mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:  For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,  Nor miss of the reproof, which that implies,  'That well they thrive not sworn with vanity.\"'          CANTO XII    Soon as its final word the blessed flame  Had rais'd for utterance, straight the holy mill  Began to wheel, nor yet had once revolv'd,  Or ere another, circling, compass'd it,  Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining,  Song, that as much our muses doth excel,  Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as ray  Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex.    As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,  Two arches parallel, and trick'd alike,  Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birth  From that within (in manner of that voice  Whom love did melt away, as sun the mist),  And they who gaze, presageful call to mind  The compact, made with Noah, of the world  No more to be o'erflow'd; about us thus  Of sempiternal roses, bending, wreath'd  Those garlands twain, and to the innermost  E'en thus th' external answered.  When the footing,  And other great festivity, of song,  And radiance, light with light accordant, each  Jocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still'd  (E'en as the eyes by quick volition mov'd,  Are shut and rais'd together), from the heart  Of one amongst the new lights mov'd a voice,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],[0,"Drum-Taps (#7)"],[1,"             responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)    Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the              moderate night-wind,    Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the              battle-field spreading,    Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,    But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,    Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my              chin in my hands,    Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest              comrade--not a tear, not a word,    Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my              soldier,    As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,    Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your              death,    I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall              surely meet again,)    Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn              appear'd,    My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,    Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully              under feet,    And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave,              in his rude-dug grave I deposited,    Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field              dim,    Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth              responding,)    Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day              brighten'd,    I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his              blanket,    And buried him where he fell.          A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN.        A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,    A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,    Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,    Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted              building,    We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted              building,    'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu              hospital,    Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and              poems ever made,    Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and              lamps,    And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and              clouds of smoke,    By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in              the pews laid down,    At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of              bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)    I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a              lily,)    Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it              all,    Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,              some of them dead,    Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,              the odor of blood,    The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also              fill'd,    Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the              death-spasm sweating,    An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,    The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the              torches,    These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,    Then hear outside the orders given, _Fall in, my men, fall in_;    But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives              he me,    Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,    Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,    The unknown road still marching.          A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM.        A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,    As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,    As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital              tent,    Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended              lying,    Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,    Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.      Curious I halt and silent stand,    Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just              lift the blanket;    Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair, and              flesh all sunken about the eyes?    Who are you my dear comrade?      Then to the second I step-and who are you my child and darling?    Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?      Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of              beautiful yellow-white ivory;    Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the              Christ himself,    Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.          AS TOILSOME I WANDER'D VIRGINIA'S WOODS.        As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,    To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)    I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;    Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I              understand,)    The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose-yet this sign              left,    On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,    _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._      Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,    Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,    Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in              the crowded street,    Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription              rude in Virginia's woods,    _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._          NOT THE PILOT.        Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,    though beaten back and many times baffled;    Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,    By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he              reaches his destination,    More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose a              march for these States,    For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries              hence.          YEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME.        Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!    Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,    A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,    Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,    Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?    And sullen hymns of defeat?          THE WOUND-DRESSER.      1      An old man bending I come among new faces,    Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,    Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,    (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge              relentless war,    But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,    To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)    Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these              chances,    Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally              brave;)    Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,    Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?    What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,    Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?    2      O maidens and young men I love and that love me,    What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking              recalls,    Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and              dust,    In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the              rush of successful charge,    Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they              fade,    Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or              soldiers' joys,    (Both I remember well-many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was              content.)      But in silence, in dreams' projections,    While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,    So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the              sand,    With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up              there,    Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)      Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,    Straight and swift to my wounded I go,    Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,    Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,    Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,    To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,    To each and all one after another I drawn near, not one do I miss,    An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,    Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd              again.      I onward go, I stop,    With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,    I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,    One turns to me his appealing eyes-poor boy! I never knew you,    Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that              would save you.    3      On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)    The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage              away,)    The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I              examine,    Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life              struggles hard,    (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
