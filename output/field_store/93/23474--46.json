The description of Christ the beloved,  Cant. 5. 9-12 14 15 16.    1 The wondering world enquires to know  Why I should love my Jesus so:  \"What are his charms,\" say they, \"above  \"The objects of a mortal love!\"    2 Yes, my beloved, to my sight,  Shews a sweet mixture red and white:  All human beauties, all divine,  In my beloved meet and shine,    3 White is his soul, from blemish free;  Red with the blood he shed for me;  The fairest of ten thousand fairs:  A sun amongst ten thousand stars.    4 [His head the finest gold excels,  There wisdom in perfection dwells;  And glory like a crown adorns  Those temples once beset with thorns.    5 Compassions in his heart are found,  Hard by the signals of his wound;  His sacred side no more shall bear  The cruel scourge, the piercing spear.]    6 [His hands are fairer to behold  Than diamonds set in rings of gold;  Those heavenly hands that on the tree  Were nail'd, and torn, and bled for me.    7 Tho' once he bow'd his feeble knees,  Loaded with sins and agonies,  Now on the throne of his command  His legs like marble pillars stand.]    8 [His eyes are majesty and love,  The eagle temper'd with the dove:  No more shall trickling sorrows roll  Thro' those dear windows of his soul.    9 His mouth, that pour'd out long complaints,  Now smiles, and cheers his fainting saints;  His countenance more graceful is  Than Lebanon with all its trees.]    10 All over glorious is my Lord,  Must be belov'd, and yet ador'd:  His worth if all the nations knew,  Sure the whole earth would love him too.      Hymn 1:76.  Christ dwells in heaven, but visits on earth,  Cant. 6. 1 2 3 12.    1 When strangers stand and hear me tell  What beauties in my Saviour dwell;  Where he is gone, they fain would know,  That they may seek and love him too.    2 My best beloved keeps his throne  On hills of light in worlds unknown  But he descends, and shews his face  In the young gardens of his grace.    3 [In vineyards planted by his hand,  Where fruitful trees in order stand;  He feeds among the spicy beds,  Where lilies shew their spotless heads.    4 He has engross'd my warmest love,  No earthly charms my soul can move:  I have a mansion in his heart,  Nor death nor hell shall make us part.]    5 [He takes my soul ere I'm aware,  And shews me where his glories are;  No chariot of Amminadib  The heavenly rapture can describe.    6 O may my spirit daily rise  On wings of faith above the skies,  Till death shall make my last remove  To dwell for ever with my love.]      Hymn 1:77.  The love of Christ to the church, in his language to  her, and provisions for her, Cant. 7. 5 6 9 12 13.    1 Now in the galleries of his grace  Appears the King, and thus he says,  \"How fair my saints are in my sight;  \"My love how pleasant for delight!\"    2 Kind is thy language, sovereign Lord,  There's heavenly grace in every word:  From that dear mouth a stream divine  Flows sweeter than the choicest wine.    3 Such wondrous love awakes the lip  Of saints that were almost asleep,  To speak the praises of thy name,  And makes our cold affections flame.    4 These are the joys he lets us know  In fields and villages below,  Gives us a relish of his love,  But keeps his noblest feast above.    5 In Paradise within the gates  An higher entertainment waits;  Fruits new and old laid up in store,  Where we shall feed, but thirst no more.      Hymn 1:78.  The strength of Christ's love, and the soul's jealousy  of her own, Cant. 8. 5 6 7 13 14.    1 [Who is this fair one in distress,  That travels from the wilderness?  And press'd with sorrows and with sins,  On her beloved Lord she leans.    2 This is the spouse of Christ our God,  Bought with the treasure of his blood;  And her request and her complaint  Is but the voice of every saint.]    3 \"O let my name engraven stand,  \"Both on thy heart and on thy hand:  \"Seal me upon thine arm; and wear  \"That pledge of love for ever there.    4 \"Stronger than death thy love is known,  \"Which floods of wrath could never drown;  \"And hell and earth in vain combine  \"To quench a fire so much divine.    5 \"But I am jealous of my heart,  Lest it should once from thee depart;  \"Then let thy name be well impress'd  As a fair signet on my breast.    6 \"Till thou hast brought me to thy home,  \"Where fears and doubts can never come,  \"Thy count'nance let me often see,  \"And often thou shalt hear from me.    7 \"Come, my beloved, haste away,  \"Cut short the hours of thy delay,  \"Fly like a youthful hart or roe  \"Over the hills where spices grow.\"      Hymn 1:79.  A morning hymn, Psalm 19. 5 8 and 73. 24 25.    1 God of the morning, at whose voice  The cheerful sun makes haste to rise,  And, like a giant doth rejoice  To run his journey thro' the skies;    2 From the fair chambers of the east  The circuit of his race begins,  And without weariness or rest,  Round the whole earth he flies and shines.    3 O like the sun may I fulfil  Th' appointed duties of the day,  With ready mind and active will  March on and keep my heavenly way.    4 [But I shall rove and lose the race,  If God my sun should disappear,  And leave me in this world's wild maze,  To follow every wandering star.    5 Lord, thy commands are clean and pure,  Enlightening our beclouded eyes,  Thy threatenings just, thy promise sure,  Thy gospel makes the simple wise.]    6 Give me thy counsels for my guide,  And then receive me to thy bliss;  All my desires and hopes beside  Are faint and cold compar'd to this.      Hymn 1:80.  An evening hymn, Psalm 4. 8. and 3. 5 6. and 143. 8.    1 Thus far the Lord has led me on,  Thus far his power prolongs my days,  And every evening shall make known  Some fresh memorial of his grace.    2 Much of my time has run to waste,  And I perhaps am near my home;  But he forgives my follies past,  He gives me strength for days to come.    3 I lay my body down to sleep,  Peace is the pillow for my head,  While well-appointed angels keep  Their watchful stations round my bed.    4 In vain the sons of earth or hell  Tell me a thousand frightful things,  My God in safety makes me dwell  Beneath the shadow of his wings.    5 [Faith in his name forbids my fear:  O may thy presence ne'er depart!  And in the morning make me hear  The love and kindness of thy heart.    6 Thus when the night of death shall come,  My flesh shall rest beneath the ground,  And wait thy voice to rouse my tomb,  With sweet salvation in the sound.      Hymn 1:81.  A song for morning or evening, Lam. 3. 23. Isa. 45. 7.    1 My God, how endless is thy love!  Thy gifts are every evening new;  And morning mercies from above  Gently distil like early dew.    2 Thou spreadst the curtains of the night,  Great guardian of my sleeping hours;  Thy sovereign word restores the light,  And quickens all my drowsy powers.    3 I yield my powers to thy command,  To thee I consecrate my days;  Perpetual blessings from thine hand  Demand perpetual songs of praise.      Hymn 1:82.  God far above creatures; or, Man vain and  mortal, Job 4. 77-21.    1 Shall the vile race of flesh and blood  Contend with their creator, God?  Shall mortal worms presume to be  More holy, wise, or just than he?    2 Behold he puts his trust in none  Of all the spirits round his throne;  Their natures, when compar'd with his  Are neither holy, just nor wise.    3 But how much meaner things are they  Who spring from dust and dwell in clay!  Touch'd by the finger of thy wrath,  We faint and vanish like the moth.    4 From night to day, from day to night,  We die by thousands in thy sight;  Bury'd in dust whole nations lie  Like a forgotten vanity.    5 Almighty power, to thee we bow;  How frail are we, how glorious thou!  No more the sons of earth shall dare  With an eternal God compare.      Hymn 1:83.  Afflictions and death under providence, Job 5. 6 7 8.    1 Not from the dust affliction grows,  Nor troubles rise by chance;  Yet we are born to care and woes,  A sad inheritance.    2 As sparks break out from burning coals,  And still are upwards borne;  So grief is rooted in our souls,  And man grows up to mourn.    3 Yet with my God I leave my cause,  And trust his promis'd grace;  He rules me by his well-known laws  Of love and righteousness.    4 Not all the pains that e'er I bore  Shall spoil my future peace,  For death and hell can do no more  Than what my Father please.      Hymn 1:84.  Salvation, righteousness, and strength in Christ,  Isa. 45. 21 25.    1 Jehovah speaks, let Israel hear,  Let all the earth rejoice and fear,  While God's eternal Son proclaims  His sovereign honours and his names:    2 \"I am the last, and I the first,  \"The Saviour God, and God the just;  \"There's none beside pretends to shew  \"Such justice and salvation too.    3 \"[Ye that in shades of darkness dwell,  \"Just on the verge "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#8)"],[1,"from the  stems are the very tiny leaves. The whole plant is low, bushy, and  spreading.    [Illustration: HEATH AND HEATHER.]    The flowers of the Heather are rather larger, deep crimson in colour,  and grow in clusters. On the flower stems grow very small narrow leaves;  there are generally three of them together and they do not grow so  thickly as the leaves of Heath. Among these leaves are some that are  made up of several leaflets.    Gorse, Heather, and Heath are spreading plants, and, if they were  allowed to grow unchecked, they would soon smother and destroy the  turf. Every few years therefore the Chase is burnt. In winter or spring  both Gorse and Heath burn easily, the fire spreading fast from one patch  to another. The smoke of the burning Chase may then be seen from many  miles away.    When the fire has burnt out, the Chase looks very black and dismal. But  the roots and underground stems of both the Heather and the Gorse are  still alive. Fresh shoots will grow, and soon the Gorse will be golden  in the spring, the Heather purple in the summer, as they were before.          CHAPTER XII    IN THE LANES      This is the last day that we can spend in looking for wild flowers at  Willow Farm. Perhaps some of you already knew something about flowers  before this visit. If so, you may have been disappointed that we have  not seen some favourite flower of your own. You may think we have  passed over many flowers which deserved to be noticed.    For that matter I think _every_ wild flower deserves to be noticed; but  we certainly should not have time for all. I showed you several plants  growing on the walls and roof, because it was interesting to see that  quite beautiful flowers, such as the Wallflower and the Houseleek, could  grow with very little soil. We looked rather closely at the Clovers and  at the Grasses in the hay-field, because these plants are important to  the farmer; they are part of his crops. Then, too, we noticed several  weeds which do him harm.    To-day I am going to take a kind of holiday. I shall show you three  flowers, not because they have much to do with the farmer, but because  they are great favourites of my own.    None of these are very common at Willow Farm, although I know where to  find each one. We will go first down the little stony lane which leads  from near the foldyard gate to the cottages where the shepherd and the  bailiff live. Here we shall find the Alkanet. It is a perennial, and it  blossoms here year after year. I only know one other place in the  village where it grows. Like some other flowers we have seen, it is not  really a native of England.    It has a very beautiful blue blossom, a little like the blossom of the  Forget-me-not which perhaps you know, but the flower of the Alkanet is  of a deeper, richer blue. Here again, as with so many other flowers we  have seen, the blossom is formed of the five lobes of a corolla. In the  centre of each blue blossom is a small white spot.    The blossoms grow in little clusters on a short stalk, and on this stalk  there is always one pair of small leaves. The leaves on the main stems  of the plant are larger; the lower leaves have stalks, but those on the  upper part of the stem are sessile. The leaves are hairy, and so are the  stems, which often grow two or three feet high.    We saw that the Poppy and the Pimpernel were the only two true _scarlet_  wild flowers of our fields. In the same way there is only one other  English wild flower which has such a _deep blue_ blossom as the Alkanet.  That is the Borage; and the Borage, like the Alkanet, is not really a  native of England. For a fine golden yellow flower I do not know  anything which can beat the Dandelion. If we have not seen _every_ wild  flower which grows at Willow Farm, we have at any rate seen three which  have the deepest and richest colours.    Now for my next favourite. This time we go to the shady lane leading  from Willow Farm to the church; that is the only place near here where  I have found the Lesser Periwinkle. There is also a Larger Periwinkle,  very similar to my favourite here, except in size.    [Illustration: LESSER PERIWINKLE.]    To find the Periwinkle in full flower we should have to come in spring,  but, though it is July now, we shall still find a blossom here and  there, I hope. Even in winter we might do so too.    The Lesser Periwinkle has a blue flower, but the blue is a pale lilac  blue. Here again the petals are really the five spreading lobes of the  corolla. There is something curious about these lobes. They are of a  peculiar irregular shape that is not easy to describe; they are not  exactly pointed, and they are not regular in shape. You could cut the  petal of a Buttercup into two equal parts; it would be almost impossible  to do this with the lobes of the Periwinkle blossom.    The leaves are dark green, glossy and pointed, and they grow in pairs.  Often, however, we find two pairs of leaves growing so closely together  that they seem to grow in fours. The leaves are evergreen; they do not  fade and die in autumn.    Some of the Periwinkle stems are erect and are about six inches high;  others are creeping. It is only the erect stems which bear flowers; the  creeping ones are barren. They do useful work, however, for they form  fresh roots, as we have seen the stalks of some other plants do. In this  way the whole bank beside the lane has become covered with the pretty  plant.    The Periwinkle is a comparatively small plant. The last flower--the  Foxglove--that we shall see at Willow Farm is quite different. It is a  very tall plant. It is generally described as growing from three to five  feet high, but I have seen a stem of eight or nine feet. We shall find  it growing on the hedgebank in Little Orchard, and it also often grows  in woods.    Some plants, as we know, are annuals, others are perennials. The  Foxglove is neither; it is a biennial--that is a two years' plant. If  you sow Foxglove seed you will have no flowers the first year, only a  root and a great bunch of leaves. In the second year tall stems which  bear the flowers will appear. In the autumn after it has flowered the  Foxglove generally dies, though sometimes it may live for another year,  or even two. Foxgloves, of course, will reproduce themselves by seed, as  annuals and perennials do.    [Illustration: FOXGLOVE.]    The Foxglove is something different from anything that we have seen as  yet. The flowers grow on short flower stalks and hang down from the  tall stems, a great many on each stem. Here there are no petals, but  what we see and admire so much is the bell-shaped corolla, purple-red in  colour. This purple bell is spotted with white inside. Bell-shaped is  perhaps not a very good description; the flower is more like a large  thimble or the finger of a glove.    \"A glove for a fox--that is the meaning of the name,\" you perhaps say.  No, it has nothing to do with a fox. Many years ago nearly everyone  believed in Fairies, and the Fairies were often called the Good Folk or  Good People. It is they, and not the fox, who were supposed to use the  purple blossoms as a glove. If you say \"Folk's Glove\" quickly, you will  see how easily it comes to sound Foxglove. So our last thought among the  flowers is of the Fairies, in whose existence hardly anyone believes  to-day."]]]
