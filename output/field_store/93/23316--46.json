Is it not reasonable to suppose that it   is?  You find rising out of many lowlands, crags which look exactly   like old sea-cliffs eaten by the waves, from the base of which the   waters have gone back.  Why should not those crags be old sea-cliffs?    Why should we not, following our rule of explaining the unknown by   the known, assume that such they are till someone gives us a sound   proof that they are not; and say--These great plains of England and   Scotland were probably once covered by a shallow sea, and their soils   made as the soil of any tide-flat is being made now?    But you may say, and most reasonably \"The tide-flats are just at the   sea-level.  The whole of the lowland is many feet above the sea; it   must therefore have been raised out of the sea, according to your   theory:  and what proofs have you of that?\"    Well, that is a question both grand and deep, on which I shall not   enter yet; but meanwhile, to satisfy you that I wish to play fair   with you, I ask you to believe nothing but what you can prove for   yourselves.  Let me ask you this:  suppose that you had proof   positive that I had fallen into the river in the morning; would not   your meeting me in the evening be also proof positive that somehow or   other I had in the course of the day got out of the river?  I think   you will accept that logic as sound.    Now if I can give you proof positive, proof which you can see with   your own eyes, and handle with your own hands, and alas! often feel   but too keenly with your own feet, that the whole of the lowlands   were once beneath the sea; then will it not be certain that, somehow   or other, they must have been raised out of the sea again?    And that I propose to do in my next paper, when I speak of the   pebbles in the street.    Meanwhile I wish you to face fairly the truly grand idea, which all I   have said tends to prove true--that all the soil we see is made by   the destruction of older soils, whether soft as clay, or hard as   rock; that rain, rivers, and seas are perpetually melting and   grinding up old land, to compose new land out of it; and that it must   have been doing so, as long as rain, rivers, and seas have existed.    \"But how did the first land of all get made?\"  I can only reply:  A   natural question:  but we can only answer that, by working from the   known to the unknown.  While we are finding out how these later lands   were made and unmade, we may stumble on some hints as to how the   first primeval continents rose out of the bosom of the sea.    And thus I end this paper.  I trust it has not been intolerably dull.    But I wanted at starting to show my readers something of the right   way of finding out truth on this and perhaps on all subjects; to make   some simple appeals to your common sense; and to get you to accept   some plain rules founded on common sense, which will be of infinite   use to both you and me in my future papers.    I hope, meanwhile, that you will agree with me, that there is plenty   of geological matter to be seen and thought over in the neighbourhood   of any town.    Be sure, that wherever there is a river, even a drain; and a stone   quarry, or even a roadside bank; much more where there is a sea, or a   tidal aestuary, there is geology enough to be learnt, to explain the   greater part of the making of all the continents on the globe.        II.  THE PEBBLES IN THE STREET        If you, dear reader, dwell in any northern town, you will almost   certainly see paving courts and alleys, and sometimes--to the   discomfort of your feet--whole streets, or set up as bournestones at   corners, or laid in heaps to be broken up for road-metal, certain   round pebbles, usually dark brown or speckled gray, and exceedingly   tough and hard.  Some of them will be very large--boulders of several   feet in diameter.  If you move from town to town, from the north of   Scotland as far down as Essex on the east, or as far down as   Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton (at least) on the west, you will still   find these pebbles, but fewer and smaller as you go south.  It   matters not what the rocks and soils of the country round may be.    However much they may differ, these pebbles will be, on the whole,   the same everywhere.    But if your town be south of the valley of the Thames, you will find,   as far as I am aware, no such pebbles there.  The gravels round you   will be made up entirely of rolled chalk flints, and bits of beds   immediately above or below the chalk.  The blocks of \"Sarsden\"   sandstone--those of which Stonehenge is built--and the \"plum-pudding   stones\" which are sometimes found with them, have no kindred with the   northern pebbles.  They belong to beds above the chalk.    Now if, seeing such pebbles about your town, you inquire, like a   sensible person who wishes to understand something of the spot on   which he lives, whence they come, you will be shown either a gravel-  pit or a clay-pit.  In the gravel the pebbles and boulders lie mixed   with sand, as they do in the railway cutting just south of   Shrewsbury; or in huge mounds of fine sweet earth, as they do in the   gorge of the Tay about Dunkeld, and all the way up Strathmore, where   they form long grassy mounds--tomauns as they call them in some parts   of Scotland--askers as they call them in Ireland.  These mounds, with   their sweet fresh turf rising out of heather and bog, were tenanted--  so Scottish children used to believe--by fairies.  He that was lucky   might hear inside them fairy music, and, the jingling of the fairy   horses' trappings.  But woe to him if he fell asleep upon the mound,   for he would be spirited away into fairyland for seven years, which   would seem to him but one day.  A strange fancy; yet not so strange   as the actual truth as to what these mounds are, and how they came   into their places.    Or again, you might find that your town's pebbles and boulders came   out of a pit of clay, in which they were stuck, without any order or   bedding, like plums and raisins in a pudding.  This clay goes usually   by the name of boulder-clay.  You would see such near any town in   Cheshire and Lancashire; or along Leith shore, near Edinburgh; or, to   give one more instance out of hundreds, along the coast at   Scarborough.  If you walk along the shore southward of that town, you   will see, in the gullies of the cliff, great beds of sticky clay,   stuffed full of bits of every rock between the Lake mountains and   Scarborough, from rounded pebbles of most ancient rock down to great   angular fragments of ironstone and coal.  There, as elsewhere, the   great majority of the pebbles have nothing to do with the rock on   which the clay happens to lie, but have come, some of them, from   places many miles away.    Now if we find spread over a low land pebbles composed of rocks which   are only found in certain high lands, is it not an act of common   sense to say--These pebbles have come from the highlands?  And if the   pebbles are rounded, while the rocks like them in the highlands   always break off in angular shapes, is it not, again, an act of mere   common sense to say--These pebbles were once angular, and have been   rubbed round, either in getting hither or before they started hither?    Does all this seem to you mere truism, my dear reader?  If so, I am   sincerely glad to hear it.  It was not so very long ago that such   arguments would have been considered not only no truisms, but not   even common sense.    But to return, let us take, as an example, a sample of these boulder   clay pebbles from the neighbourhood of Liverpool and Birkenhead, made   by Mr. De Rance, the government geological surveyor:    Granite, greenstone, felspar porphyry, felstone, quartz rock (all   igneous rocks, that is, either formed by, or altered by volcanic   heat, and almost all found in the Lake mountains), 37 per cent.    Silurian grits (the common stones of the Lake mountains deposited by   water), 43 per cent.    Ironstone, 1 per cent.    Carboniferous limestone, 5 per cent.    Permian or Triassic sandstones, i.e. rocks immediately round   Liverpool, 12 per cent.    Now, does not this sample show, as far as human common sense can be   depended on, that the great majority of these stones come from the   Lake mountains, sixty or seventy miles north of Liverpool?  I think   your common sense will tell you that these pebbles are not mere   concretions; that is, formed out of the substance of the clay after   it was deposited.  The least knowledge of mineralogy would prove   that.  But, even if you are no mineralogist, common sense will tell   you, that if they were all concreted out of the same clay, it is most   likely that they would be all of the same kind, and not of a dozen or   more different kinds.  Common sense will tell you, also, that if they   were all concreted out of the same clay, it is a most extraordinary   coincidence, indeed one too strange to be believed, if any less   strange explanation can be found--that they should have taken the   composition of different rocks which are found all together in one   group of mountains to the northward.  You will surely say--If this be   granite, it has most probably come from a granite mountain; if this   be grit, from a grit-stone mountain, and so on with the whole list.    Why--are we to go out of our way to seek improbable explanations,   when there is a probable one staring us in the face?    Next--and this is well worth your notice--if you will examine the   pebbles carefully, especially the larger ones, you will find that   they are not only more or less rounded, but often scratched; and   often, too, in more than one direction, two or even three sets of   scratches crossing each other; marked, as a cat marks an elder stem   when she sharpens her claws upon it; and that these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1027"],[0,"The Lone Star Ranger: A Romance of the Border (#8)"],[1,"situated, but  with the difference that no man wanted to put him in jail or take his  life, he felt that this burning passion to be free, to save himself,  might not have been so powerful. Life certainly held no bright prospects  for him. Already he had begun to despair of ever getting back to his  home. But to give up like a white-hearted coward, to let himself be  handcuffed and jailed, to run from a drunken, bragging cowboy, or be  shot in cold blood by some border brute who merely wanted to add another  notch to his gun--these things were impossible for Duane because there  was in him the temper to fight. In that hour he yielded only to fate and  the spirit inborn in him. Hereafter this gun must be a living part  of him. Right then and there he returned to a practice he had long  discontinued--the draw. It was now a stern, bitter, deadly business with  him. He did not need to fire the gun, for accuracy was a gift and had  become assured. Swiftness on the draw, however, could be improved, and  he set himself to acquire the limit of speed possible to any man. He  stood still in his tracks; he paced the room; he sat down, lay down,  put himself in awkward positions; and from every position he practiced  throwing his gun--practiced it till he was hot and tired and his arm  ached and his hand burned. That practice he determined to keep up every  day. It was one thing, at least, that would help pass the weary hours.    Later he went outdoors to the cooler shade of the cottonwoods. From  this point he could see a good deal of the valley. Under different  circumstances Duane felt that he would have enjoyed such a beautiful  spot. Euchre's shack sat against the first rise of the slope of the  wall, and Duane, by climbing a few rods, got a view of the whole valley.  Assuredly it was an outlaw settle meet. He saw a good many Mexicans,  who, of course, were hand and glove with Bland. Also he saw enormous  flat-boats, crude of structure, moored along the banks of the river. The  Rio Grande rolled away between high bluffs. A cable, sagging deep in  the middle, was stretched over the wide yellow stream, and an old scow,  evidently used as a ferry, lay anchored on the far shore.    The valley was an ideal retreat for an outlaw band operating on a big  scale. Pursuit scarcely need be feared over the broken trails of the Rim  Rock. And the open end of the valley could be defended against almost  any number of men coming down the river. Access to Mexico was easy and  quick. What puzzled Duane was how Bland got cattle down to the river,  and he wondered if the rustler really did get rid of his stolen stock by  use of boats.    Duane must have idled considerable time up on the hill, for when he  returned to the shack Euchre was busily engaged around the camp-fire.    \"Wal, glad to see you ain't so pale about the gills as you was,\" he  said, by way of greeting. \"Pitch in an' we'll soon have grub ready.  There's shore one consolin' fact round this here camp.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Duane.    \"Plenty of good juicy beef to eat. An' it doesn't cost a short bit.\"    \"But it costs hard rides and trouble, bad conscience, and life, too,  doesn't it?\"    \"I ain't shore about the bad conscience. Mine never bothered me none.  An' as for life, why, thet's cheap in Texas.\"    \"Who is Bland?\" asked Duane, quickly changing the subject. \"What do you  know about him?\"    \"We don't know who he is or where he hails from,\" replied Euchre.  \"Thet's always been somethin' to interest the gang. He must have been  a young man when he struck Texas. Now he's middle-aged. I remember how  years ago he was soft-spoken an' not rough in talk or act like he is  now. Bland ain't likely his right name. He knows a lot. He can doctor  you, an' he's shore a knowin' feller with tools. He's the kind thet  rules men. Outlaws are always ridin' in here to join his gang, an' if  it hadn't been fer the gamblin' an' gun-play he'd have a thousand men  around him.\"    \"How many in his gang now?\"    \"I reckon there's short of a hundred now. The number varies. Then Bland  has several small camps up an' down the river. Also he has men back on  the cattle-ranges.\"    \"How does he control such a big force?\" asked Duane. \"Especially when  his band's composed of bad men. Luke Stevens said he had no use for  Bland. And I heard once somewhere that Bland was a devil.\"    \"Thet's it. He is a devil. He's as hard as flint, violent in temper,  never made any friends except his right-hand men, Dave Rugg an' Chess  Alloway. Bland'll shoot at a wink. He's killed a lot of fellers, an'  some fer nothin'. The reason thet outlaws gather round him an' stick is  because he's a safe refuge, an' then he's well heeled. Bland is rich.  They say he has a hundred thousand pesos hid somewhere, an' lots of  gold. But he's free with money. He gambles when he's not off with a  shipment of cattle. He throws money around. An' the fact is there's  always plenty of money where he is. Thet's what holds the gang. Dirty,  bloody money!\"    \"It's a wonder he hasn't been killed. All these years on the border!\"  exclaimed Duane.    \"Wal,\" replied Euchre, dryly, \"he's been quicker on the draw than the  other fellers who hankered to kill him, thet's all.\"    Euchre's reply rather chilled Duane's interest for the moment. Such  remarks always made his mind revolve round facts pertaining to himself.    \"Speakin' of this here swift wrist game,\" went on Euchre, \"there's been  considerable talk in camp about your throwin' of a gun. You know, Buck,  thet among us fellers--us hunted men--there ain't anythin' calculated  to rouse respect like a slick hand with a gun. I heard Bland say this  afternoon--an' he said it serious-like an' speculative--thet he'd  never seen your equal. He was watchin' of you close, he said, an' just  couldn't follow your hand when you drawed. All the fellers who seen you  meet Bosomer had somethin' to say. Bo was about as handy with a gun as  any man in this camp, barrin' Chess Alloway an' mebbe Bland himself.  Chess is the captain with a Colt--or he was. An' he shore didn't like  the references made about your speed. Bland was honest in acknowledgin'  it, but he didn't like it, neither. Some of the fellers allowed your  draw might have been just accident. But most of them figgered different.  An' they all shut up when Bland told who an' what your Dad was. 'Pears  to me I once seen your Dad in a gunscrape over at Santone, years ago.  Wal, I put my oar in to-day among the fellers, an' I says: 'What ails  you locoed gents? Did young Duane budge an inch when Bo came roarin'  out, blood in his eye? Wasn't he cool an' quiet, steady of lips, an'  weren't his eyes readin' Bo's mind? An' thet lightnin' draw--can't  you-all see thet's a family gift?'\"    Euchre's narrow eyes twinkled, and he gave the dough he was rolling a  slap with his flour-whitened hand. Manifestly he had proclaimed himself  a champion and partner of Duane's, with all the pride an old man could  feel in a young one whom he admired.    \"Wal,\" he resumed, presently, \"thet's your introduction to the border,  Buck. An' your card was a high trump. You'll be let severely alone by  real gun-fighters an' men like Bland, Alloway, Rugg, an' the bosses of  the other gangs. After all, these real men are men, you know, an' onless  you cross them they're no more likely to interfere with you than you  are with them. But there's a sight of fellers like Bosomer in the river  country. They'll all want your game. An' every town you ride into will  scare up some cowpuncher full of booze or a long-haired four-flush  gunman or a sheriff--an' these men will be playin' to the crowd an'  yellin' for your blood. Thet's the Texas of it. You'll have to hide fer  ever in the brakes or you'll have to KILL such men. Buck, I reckon this  ain't cheerful news to a decent chap like you. I'm only tellin' you  because I've taken a likin' to you, an' I seen right off thet you ain't  border-wise. Let's eat now, an' afterward we'll go out so the gang can  see you're not hidin'.\"    When Duane went out with Euchre the sun was setting behind a blue range  of mountains across the river in Mexico. The valley appeared to open to  the southwest. It was a tranquil, beautiful scene. Somewhere in a house  near at hand a woman was singing. And in the road Duane saw a little  Mexican boy driving home some cows, one of which wore a bell. The  sweet, happy voice of a woman and a whistling barefoot boy--these seemed  utterly out of place here.    Euchre presently led to the square and the row of rough houses Duane  remembered. He almost stepped on a wide imprint in the dust where  Bosomer had confronted him. And a sudden fury beset him that he should  be affected strangely by the sight of it.    \"Let's have a look in here,\" said Euchre.    Duane had to bend his head to enter the door. He found himself in a very  large room inclosed by adobe walls and roofed with brush. It was full of  rude benches, tables, seats. At one corner a number of kegs and barrels  lay side by side in a rack. A Mexican boy was lighting lamps hung on  posts that sustained the log rafters of the roof.    \"The only feller who's goin' to put a close eye on you is Benson,\"  said Euchre. \"He runs the place an' sells drinks. The gang calls him  Jackrabbit Benson, because he's always got his eye peeled an' his ear  cocked. Don't notice him if he looks you over, Buck. Benson is scared to  death of every new-comer who rustles into Bland's camp. An' the reason,  I take it, is because he's done somebody dirt. He's hidin'. Not from  a sheriff or ranger! Men who hide from them don't act like Jackrabbit  Benson. He's hidin' from some guy who's huntin' him to kill him. Wal,  I'm always expectin' to see some feller ride in here an' throw a gun on  Benson. Can't say I'd be grieved.\"    Duane casually glanced in the direction indicated, and he saw a spare,  gaunt man with a face strikingly white beside the red and bronze "]]]
