Rest and hygiene on the mother's part continue to be  necessary alike in her own interests and in the child's. This need has  indeed been more generally and more practically recognized than the need  for rest during pregnancy. The laws of several countries make compulsory a  period of rest from employment after confinement, and in some countries  they seek to provide for the remuneration of the mother during this  enforced rest. In no country, indeed, is the principle carried out so  thoroughly and for so long a period as is desirable. But it is the right  principle, and embodies the germ which, in the future, will be developed.  There can be little doubt that whatever are the matters, and they are  certainly many, which may be safely left to the discretion of the  individual, the care of the mother and her child is not among them. That  is a matter which, more than any other, concerns the community as a whole,  and the community cannot afford to be slack in asserting its authority  over it. The State needs healthy men and women, and by any negligence in  attending to this need it inflicts serious charges of all sorts upon  itself, and at the same time dangerously impairs its efficiency in the  world. Nations have begun to recognize the desirability of education, but  they have scarcely yet begun to realize that the nationalization of health  is even more important than the nationalization of education. If it were  necessary to choose between the task of getting children educated and the  task of getting them well-born and healthy it would be better to abandon  education. There have been many great peoples who never dreamed of  national systems of education; there has been no great people without the  art of producing healthy and vigorous children.    This matter becomes of peculiar importance in great industrial states like  England, the United States, and Germany, because in such states a tacit  conspiracy tends to grow up to subordinate national ends to individual  ends, and practically to work for the deterioration of the race. In  England, for instance, this tendency has become peculiarly well marked  with disastrous results. The interest of the employed woman tends to  become one with that of her employer; between them they combine to crush  the interests of the child who represents the race, and to defeat the laws  made in the interests of the race which are those of the community as a  whole. The employed woman wishes to earn as much wages as she can and with  as little interruption as she can; in gratifying that wish she is, at the  same time, acting in the interests of the employer, who carefully avoids  thwarting her.    This impulse on the employed woman's part is by no means always and  entirely the result of poverty, and would not, therefore, be removed by  raising her wages. Long before marriage, when little more than a child,  she has usually gone out to work, and work has become a second nature. She  has mastered her work, she enjoys a certain position and what to her are  high wages; she is among her friends and companions; the noise and bustle  and excitement of the work-room or the factory have become an agreeable  stimulant which she can no longer do without. On the other hand, her home  means nothing to her; she only returns there to sleep, leaving it next  morning at day-break or earlier; she is ignorant even of the simplest  domestic arts; she moves about in her own home like a strange and awkward  child. The mere act of marriage cannot change this state of things;  however willing she may be at marriage to become a domesticated wife, she  is destitute alike of the inclination or the skill for domesticity. Even  in spite of herself she is driven back to the work-shop, to the one place  where she feels really at home.        In Germany women are not allowed to work for four weeks after      confinement, nor during the following two weeks except by medical      certificate. The obligatory insurance against disease which      covers women at confinement assures them an indemnity at this      time equivalent to a large part of their wages. Married and      unmarried mothers benefit alike. The Austrian law is founded on      the same model. This measure has led to a very great decrease in      infantile mortality, and, therefore, a great increase in health      among those who survive. It is, however, regarded as very      inadequate, and there is a movement in Germany for extending the      time, for applying the system to a larger number of women, and      for making it still more definitely compulsory.        In Switzerland it has been illegal since 1877 for any woman to be      received into a factory after confinement, unless she has rested      in all for eight weeks, six weeks at least of this period being      after confinement. Since 1898 Swiss working women have been      protected by law from exercising hard work during pregnancy, and      from various other influences likely to be injurious. But this      law is evaded in practice, because it provides no compensatory      indemnity for the woman. An attempt, in 1899, to amend the law by      providing for such indemnity was rejected by the people.        In Belgium and Holland there are laws against women working      immediately after confinement, but no indemnity is provided, so      that employers and employed combine to evade the law. In France      there is no such law, although its necessity has often been      emphatically asserted (see, e.g., Salvat, _La Depopulation de la      France_, These de Lyon, 1903).        In England it is illegal to employ a woman \"knowingly\" in a      work-shop within four weeks of the birth of her child, but no      provision is made by the law for the compensation of the woman      who is thus required to sacrifice herself to the interests of the      State. The woman evades the law in tacit collusion with her      employers, who can always avoid \"knowing\" that a birth has taken      place, and so escape all responsibility for the mother's      employment. Thus the factory inspectors are unable to take      action, and the law becomes a dead letter; in 1906 only one      prosecution for this offense could be brought into court. By the      insertion of this \"knowingly\" a premium is placed on ignorance.      The unwisdom of thus beforehand placing a premium on ignorance      has always been more or less clearly recognized by the framers of      legal codes even as far back as the days of the Ten Commandments      and the laws of Hamurabi. It is the business of the Court, of      those who administer the law, to make allowance for ignorance      where such allowance is fairly called for; it is not for the      law-maker to make smooth the path of the law-breaker. There are      evidently law-makers nowadays so scrupulous, or so simple-minded,      that they would be prepared to exact that no pickpocket should be      prosecuted if he was able to declare on oath that he had no      \"knowledge\" that the purse he had taken belonged to the person he      extracted it from.        The annual reports of the English factory inspectors serve to      bring ridicule on this law, which looks so wisely humane and yet      means nothing, but have so far been powerless to effect any      change. These reports show, moreover, that the difficulty is      increasing in magnitude. Thus Miss Martindale, a factory      inspector, states that in all the towns she visits, from a quiet      cathedral city to a large manufacturing town, the employment of      married women is rapidly increasing; they have worked in mills or      factories all their lives and are quite unaccustomed to cooking,      housework and the rearing of children, so that after marriage,      even when not compelled by poverty, they prefer to go on working      as before. Miss Vines, another factory inspector, repeats the      remark of a woman worker in a factory. \"I do not need to work,      but I do not like staying at home,\" while another woman said, \"I      would rather be at work a hundred times than at home. I get lost      at home\" (_Annual Report Chief Inspector of Factories and      Workshops for 1906_, pp. 325, etc.).        It may be added that not only is the English law enjoining four      weeks' rest on the mother after childbirth practically      inoperative, but the period itself is absurdly inadequate. As a      rest for the mother it is indeed sufficient, but the State is      still more interested in the child than in its mother, and the      child needs the mother's chief care for a much longer period than      four weeks. Helme advocates the State prohibition of women's work      for at least six months after confinement. Where nurseries are      attached to factories, enabling the mother to suckle her infant      in intervals of work, the period may doubtless be shortened.        It is important to remember that it is by no means only the women      in factories who are induced to work as usual during the whole      period of pregnancy, and to return to work immediately after the      brief rest of confinement. The Research Committee of the      Christian Social Union (London Branch) undertook, in 1905, an      inquiry into the employment of women after childbirth. Women in      factories and workshops were excluded from the inquiry which only      had reference to women engaged in household duties, in home      industries, and in casual work. It was found that the majority      carry on their employment right up to the time of confinement and      resume it from ten to fourteen days later. The infantile death      rate for the children of women engaged only in household duties      was greatly lower than that for the children of the other women,      while, as ever, the hand-fed infants had a vastly higher death      rate than the breast-fed infants (_British Medical Journal_, Oct.      24,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#8)"],[1,"of the walls were such as would not  permit of the superstructure being preserved or successfully dealt with  by any of the well-known expedients frequently recommended and sometimes  employed with success.\" When it became generally known that the Dean and  Chapter intended to act upon the advice given in these two reports, the  knowledge created the greatest possible excitement. Other plans were  suggested; the mere removal of a single stone to make it more secure was  declared quite unnecessary; the taking down a gable to rebuild it was  denounced as Vandalism. Much strong language and many hard words were  used which had better be forgotten. It certainly seems difficult to  explain how the objectors to the course that had been decided upon could  write of the west front that it was \"superficially, in a fair state of  preservation,\" or that it was \"literally without a patch or blemish.\"  The present writer was for twenty years a member of the cathedral  foundation, and lived just opposite the west front. He made a special  study of the history and fabric of the cathedral. Hardly a year passed  without something falling down; sometimes a piece of a pinnacle,  sometimes a crocket or other ornament, sometimes a shaft. Old engravings  of the spires show the pinnacles broken. Many of the shafts are wanting.  Some have been replaced in wood. Many wholly new ones were put up by  Dean Monk. And concerning the north arch, which was notoriously the most  dangerous, Dean Patrick has recorded that Bishop Laney gave L100 toward  the repairing one of the great arches of the church porch \"which was  faln down in the late times.\" Dean Monk also, in a memoir of his  predecessor Dean Duport,[19] speaks of the efforts of the cathedral body  to repair the devastation caused by the civil war, and says \"in  particular one of the three large arches of the West Front, the beauty  of which is acknowledged to be without rival, having fallen down, it was  restored in all its original magnificence.\" In an account of the  cathedral published by the writer thirty years ago, he says of this  arch: \"Its present state looks dangerous from below. The stones in the  arch have some sad gaps. It is tied up by iron bands, and further  protected within by a great number of wooden pegs, not of recent  construction. When last observed it leant forward 141/2 inches.\" In 1893  he wrote: \"there is no doubt that the security of the whole front is a  most serious question that before long must demand energetic action.\"    [Illustration: Finial of the Central Gable of the West Front.]    A very great preponderance of local opinion was in favour of the action  of the Dean and Chapter. When it came to moving the stones, after all  the rubbish was removed, it was found that the mortar had crumbled into  mere dust, and could be swept away; and that the stones themselves could  be lifted from their positions, without the use of any tool. What has  actually been done is this: the north gable has been taken down with the  outer orders of the archivolt for a depth of some feet, and rebuilt; the  innermost order has not been moved. Relieving arches have been put in at  the back. The gable is now believed to be perfectly secure. The cross on  the summit was replaced in its position on July 2nd, 1897. The south  gable was afterwards taken down and rebuilt, a very few new stones being  used to bond the masonry where a fracture had been found on the left  side of the great arch below. This is what has been called \"the  destruction\" of the west front.          CHAPTER II.    THE CATHEDRAL--EXTERIOR.    Nearly every cathedral and large abbey church has some one conspicuous  feature by which it is remembered, and with which it is specially  associated in the minds of most persons. Nearly every one also claims  for itself to have the best example of some one architectural feature,  or the largest, or the oldest, or in some other way the most remarkable.  Occasionally the claim is indisputable, because the boasted object is  unique in the country; as is the case with the octagon at Ely, the three  spires at Lichfield, the situation and western Galilee of Durham, and  the almost perfect unity of design at Salisbury. Sometimes, if not  unique, there is no question as to the justice of the claim for  superiority; whether it be for a thing of beauty, like the cloisters at  Gloucester, or the Norman tower at Norwich, or the east window of  Carlisle, or the angel-choir at Lincoln; or for size or extent, when the  question narrows itself to a mere matter of measurement.    But it is not always by any means the fact that this prominent feature,  though it is the pride of the inhabitants and a source of admiration to  visitors, is really the most noteworthy thing belonging to the church.  This seems specially the case at Peterborough. Probably nobody speaks or  thinks of Peterborough cathedral without immediately associating it with  its glorious west front. Many believe that there is little else in the  building that is worthy of any particular attention. And yet nowhere in  the kingdom is there to be found a finer and more complete Norman  church. Arches, windows, mouldings, more elaborate and more grand may no  doubt be found elsewhere; but where else can we find, as here, choir,  transepts, and nave, with all the original Norman, from ground to roof,  with two insignificant exceptions, remaining unaltered? It is natural  to compare the three great East Anglian Cathedrals, as all have superb  work of the Norman period. But at Norwich the lower arches in the choir  have been rebuilt in the Perpendicular style, while the vaulted roof of  the nave, raised in the fifteenth century, is less in keeping with the  sturdy architecture beneath it than the wooden ceiling at Peterborough.  At Ely, beautiful as is the work in the octagon and choir, there is no  Norman work east of the transepts. Of course we are referring to the  main arches and pillars of the building, and not to the tracery of the  windows, or to alterations to the walls. The two exceptions mentioned  above are the pointed arches, east and west of the central tower, and  the removal of the three lowest windows in the apse.    [Illustration: The West Front.]    The greatest attraction to the world at large is undoubtedly =the West  Front=, which is seen in its full beauty on entering the close.    The following lines, from Morris's \"Earthly Paradise,\" may fitly  introduce the subject.        \"For other tales they told, and one of these       Not all the washing of the troublous seas,       Nor all the changeful days whereof ye know,       Have swept from out my memory: even so       Small things far off will be remembered clear       When matters both more mighty and more near,       Are waxing dim to us. I, who have seen       So many lands, and midst such marvels been,       Clearer than these abodes of outland men,       Can see above the green and unburnt fen       The little houses of an English town,       Cross-timbered, thatched with fen-reeds coarse and brown,       And high o'er these, three gables, great and fair,       That slender rods of columns do upbear       Over the minster doors, and imagery       Of kings, and flowers no summer field doth see,       Wrought in these gables.--Yea I heard withal,       In the fresh morning air, the trowels fall       Upon the stone, a thin noise far away;       For high up wrought the masons on that day,       Since to the monks that house seemed scarcely well       Till they had set a spire or pinnacle       Each side the great porch. In that burgh I heard       This tale, and late have set down every word       That I remembered, when the thoughts would come       Of what we did in our deserted home,       And of the days, long past, when we were young,       Nor knew the cloudy days that o'er us hung.       And howsoever I am now grown old,       Yet is it still the tale I then heard told       Within the guest house of that Minster Close,       Whose walls, like cliffs new made, before us rose.\"    It is rather a porch, or piazza, than a front; for it consists of a  paved walk of some extent outside the wall of the cathedral covered at a  great height by a vaulted roof which is supported by the wall and by the  three great arches. Mr Fergusson, in his \"Handbook of Architecture,\"[20]  pronounces that \"as a portico, using the term in its classical sense,  the west front of Peterborough is the grandest and finest in Europe\":  and there are few that will not agree with him. Professor Freeman  says:[21]--\"The portico of Peterborough is unique; the noblest  conception of the old Greek translated into the speech of Christendom  and of England has no fellow before it or after it.\" Exclusive of the  spires, and the central porch and parvise, the dates of which have been  given previously, the whole is of the best and purest Early English  style. The effect is certainly improved by the middle arch being  narrower than the others. But if the gables above had been of unequal  angles, the result would have been far less satisfactory. Wisely,  therefore, these angles have been made equal, and all of the same  height: and the device of the architect to secure this, by making the  central gable rise from points somewhat higher than the others, is  admirable. It is to be observed also that the turrets, or large  pinnacles, that are placed between the gables, are not placed exactly  above the central line of the great piers beneath them, but are in each  case a little further towards the outer arches; and it will be seen,  immediately that this is pointed out, how much the upper part of the  facade is thereby improved. The two great piers may be roughly taken as  having for section an isosceles right-angled triangle, the right angle  being towards the west. The mouldings of the arches are supported by a  series of banded shafts, six on each side of each arch. In the spaces"]]]
