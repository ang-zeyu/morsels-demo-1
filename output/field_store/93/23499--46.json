PART II.: BOYS.    BY F. ARTHUR SIBLY, M.A., LL.D.    PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.      My contribution to this little book was originally intended for the  eyes of parents, scoutmasters, and other adults. Since 1913, when the  book was first published, it has been my privilege to receive from  these so many letters of warm appreciation that it seems needless to  retain the apologetic preface which I then wrote. The object which I  had in view at that time was the hastening of a supremely important  reform. I have to-day the very deep joy of knowing that my words have  carried conviction to many adults and have given help to countless  boys.    One result of this publication was entirely unlooked for. It did not  occur to me, as I wrote, that the book would be read by boys and young  men. It was not written at all for this purpose. In some respects its  influence over them has, however, been increased by this obvious fact.  In this book boys have, as it were, overheard a confidential  conversation about themselves carried on by adults anxious for their  welfare, and some at least are evidently more impressed by this  conversation than by a direct appeal--in which they are liable to  suspect exaggeration.    I have received hundreds of letters from boys and young men. These  confirm in _every_ way the conclusions set forth in this book, and  prove that the need for guidance in sex matters is acute and  universal. The relief and assistance which many boys have experienced  from correspondence with me, and the interest which I find in their  letters have caused me--spite of the extreme preoccupation of a  strenuous life--to issue a special invitation to those who may feel  inclined to write to me.    Great diversity of opinion exists as to the best method of giving sex  instruction, and those who have had experience of one method are  curiously blind to the merits of other methods, which they usually  strongly denounce. While I have my own views as to the best method to  adopt, I am quite sure that each one of very many methods can, in  suitable hands, produce great good, and that the very poorest method  is infinitely superior to no method at all.    Some are for oral teaching, some for the use of a pamphlet, some  favour confidential individual teaching, others collective public  teaching. Some would try to make sex a sacred subject; some would  prefer to keep the emotional element out and treat reproduction as a  matter-of-fact science subject. Some wish the parent to give the  teaching, some the teacher, some the doctor, some a lecturer specially  trained for this purpose. Good results have been obtained by every  one of these methods.    During recent years much additional evidence has accumulated in my  hands of the beneficent results of such teaching as I advocate in  these pages, and I am confident that of boys who have been wisely  guided and trained, few fail to lead clean lives even when associated  with those who are generally and openly corrupt. I must, however,  emphasise my belief that the cleanliness of a boy's life depends  ultimately not upon his knowledge of good and evil but upon his  devotion to the Right.        \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,      These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\"    Where these are not, it is idle to inculcate the rarest and most  difficult of all virtues.    F. ARTHUR SIBLY.    WYCLIFFE, STONEHOUSE, GLOS.  _September 1918._          INTRODUCTORY NOTE.      The term puberty will so often be used in the following chapters that  a brief account of the phenomena of puberty may appropriately be given  at the outset of this work. Puberty is a name given to the age at  which a boy becomes capable of being a father. In temperate climates  this age is reached at about fifteen years, though some boys attain it  at twelve and some not until seventeen. The one obvious and invariable  sign of puberty is a change of pitch in the voice, which assumes its  bass character after an embarrassing period of squeaky alternations  between the high and low tones.    The age is a critical one, as several important changes take place in  body and in mind. The reproductive organs undergo considerable  development and become sensitive to any stimulus, physical or mental.  The seminal fluid, which in normal cases has hitherto been secreted  little, if at all, is now elaborated by the testicles, and contains  spermatazoa--minute organisms which are essential to reproduction.  Under the stimulus of sexual thoughts this fluid is secreted in such  quantity as to give rise to involuntary discharge during sleep. These  nocturnal emissions are so often found among boys and young men that  some physiologists consider them to be quite normal. My experience  leads me to doubt this conclusion.    Another physical change associated with puberty is the growth of hair  on the pubes and on the face: in this latter situation the growth is  slow.    With the capacity for fatherhood comes a very strong awakening of the  sexual instinct, which manifests itself in passion and in lust--the  unconscious and the conscious sex hunger. The passion shows itself in  a ludicrously indiscriminate and exaggerated susceptibility to female  attractions--a susceptibility the sexual character of which is usually  quite unrecognised. Among boys who have sex knowledge there is also a  tendency to dwell on sexual thoughts when the mind is not otherwise  occupied. Passion and lust do not at once develop their full strength;  but, coming at a time when self-control is very weak, and coming with  all the attraction of novelty, they often dominate the mind even in  normal cases, and may become tyrannous when the reproductive system  has been prematurely stimulated.    A heightened self-consciousness and an antagonism to authority so  often follow the attainment of puberty that they are usually  considered to be its results. My own experience with boys satisfies me  that this conclusion is not correct. Self-consciousness, when it  occurs in boyhood, is usually the result of an unclean inner life.  Puberty merely increases the self-consciousness by intensifying its  cause. When the mind is clean there is no marked change in this  respect at puberty. The antagonism to authority so often observed  after puberty is the product of unsatisfactory external influences.  With puberty the desire to stand well with others, and in particular  the desire to seem manly, increases. If a debased public opinion  demands of a boy the cheap manliness of profanity, tobacco, and  irreverence, the demand creates a plentiful supply, while it also  suppresses as priggish or \"pi\" any avowed or suspected devotion to  higher ideals. A healthy public opinion, working in harmony with a  boy's nobler instincts, calls forth in him an earnest devotion to high  ideals, and causes him to exercise, on the development of his powers  and in a crusade against wrong, the new energies which a wholesome  puberty places at his disposal.          CHAPTER I.    PREVALENCE OF IMPURITY AMONG BOYS: THE AUTHOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE.      Of the perils which beset the growing boy all are recognised, and, in  a measure, guarded against except the most inevitable and most fatal  peril of all. In all that concerns the use and abuse of the  reproductive organs the great majority of boys have hitherto been left  without adult guidance, and have imbibed their ideas from the coarser  of their companions and from casual references to the subject in the  Bible and other books. Under these conditions very few boys escape two  of the worst dangers into which it is possible for a lad to fall--the  artificial stimulation of the reproductive organs and the acquisition  of degraded ideas on the subject of sex. That many lives are thus  prematurely shortened, that many constitutions are permanently  enfeebled, that very many lads who might otherwise have striven  successfully against the sexual temptations of adult life  succumb--almost without a struggle--to them, can be doubted by no one  who is familiar with the inner life of boys and men.    Of these two evils, self-abuse, though productive of manifold and  disastrous results, is distinctly the less. Many boys outgrow the  physical injuries which, in ignorance, they inflict upon themselves in  youth; but very few are able wholly to cleanse themselves from the  foul desires associated in their minds with sex. These desires make  young men impotent in the face of temptation. Under their evil  dominance, even men of kind disposition will, by seduction, inflict on  an innocent girl agony, misery, degradation, and premature death. They  will indulge In the most degrading of all vices with prostitutes on  the street. They will defile the atmosphere of social life with filthy  talk and ribald jest. Even a clean and ennobling passion can do little  to redeem them. The pure stream of human love is made turbid with  lust. After a temporary uplifting in marriage the soul is again  dragged down, marriage vows are broken and the blessings of home life  are turned into wormwood and gall.    That a system so destructive of physical and of spiritual health  should have lasted almost intact until now will, I believe, shortly  become a matter for general amazement; for while evidence of the  widespread character of youthful perversion is a product of quite  recent years, the assumptions on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#8)"],[1,"  without my help, thou wouldst find it a hard matter to reach. And,  on the way, let us leave to mollahs and to monks to dispute about the  divinity of our faith, and speak on themes which belong to youthful  warriors--upon battles, upon beautiful women, upon sharp swords, and  upon bright armour.\"        CHAPTER III.    The warriors arose from their place of brief rest and simple  refreshment, and courteously aided each other while they carefully  replaced and adjusted the harness from which they had relieved for the  time their trusty steeds. Each seemed familiar with an employment which  at that time was a part of necessary and, indeed, of indispensable duty.  Each also seemed to possess, as far as the difference betwixt the animal  and rational species admitted, the confidence and affection of the horse  which was the constant companion of his travels and his warfare. With  the Saracen this familiar intimacy was a part of his early habits; for,  in the tents of the Eastern military tribes, the horse of the soldier  ranks next to, and almost equal in importance with, his wife and  his family; and with the European warrior, circumstances, and indeed  necessity, rendered his war-horse scarcely less than his brother in  arms. The steeds, therefore, suffered themselves quietly to be taken  from their food and liberty, and neighed and snuffled fondly around  their masters, while they were adjusting their accoutrements for further  travel and additional toil. And each warrior, as he prosecuted his own  task, or assisted with courtesy his companion, looked with observant  curiosity at the equipments of his fellow-traveller, and noted  particularly what struck him as peculiar in the fashion in which he  arranged his riding accoutrements.    Ere they remounted to resume their journey, the Christian Knight again  moistened his lips and dipped his hands in the living fountain, and said  to his pagan associate of the journey, \"I would I knew the name of this  delicious fountain, that I might hold it in my grateful remembrance; for  never did water slake more deliciously a more oppressive thirst than I  have this day experienced.\"    \"It is called in the Arabic language,\" answered the Saracen, \"by a name  which signifies the Diamond of the Desert.\"    \"And well is it so named,\" replied the Christian. \"My native valley hath  a thousand springs, but not to one of them shall I attach hereafter  such precious recollection as to this solitary fount, which bestows  its liquid treasures where they are not only delightful, but nearly  indispensable.\"    \"You say truth,\" said the Saracen; \"for the curse is still on yonder  sea of death, and neither man nor beast drinks of its waves, nor of the  river which feeds without filling it, until this inhospitable desert be  passed.\"    They mounted, and pursued their journey across the sandy waste. The  ardour of noon was now past, and a light breeze somewhat alleviated  the terrors of the desert, though not without bearing on its wings  an impalpable dust, which the Saracen little heeded, though his  heavily-armed companion felt it as such an annoyance that he hung his  iron casque at his saddle-bow, and substituted the light riding-cap,  termed in the language of the time a MORTIER, from its resemblance  in shape to an ordinary mortar. They rode together for some time in  silence, the Saracen performing the part of director and guide of the  journey, which he did by observing minute marks and bearings of the  distant rocks, to a ridge of which they were gradually approaching. For  a little time he seemed absorbed in the task, as a pilot when navigating  a vessel through a difficult channel; but they had not proceeded half  a league when he seemed secure of his route, and disposed, with more  frankness than was usual to his nation, to enter into conversation.    \"You have asked the name,\" he said, \"of a mute fountain, which hath the  semblance, but not the reality, of a living thing. Let me be pardoned  to ask the name of the companion with whom I have this day encountered,  both in danger and in repose, and which I cannot fancy unknown even here  among the deserts of Palestine?\"    \"It is not yet worth publishing,\" said the Christian. \"Know, however,  that among the soldiers of the Cross I am called Kenneth--Kenneth of  the Couching Leopard; at home I have other titles, but they would sound  harsh in an Eastern ear. Brave Saracen, let me ask which of the tribes  of Arabia claims your descent, and by what name you are known?\"    \"Sir Kenneth,\" said the Moslem, \"I joy that your name is such as my lips  can easily utter. For me, I am no Arab, yet derive my descent from  a line neither less wild nor less warlike. Know, Sir Knight of the  Leopard, that I am Sheerkohf, the Lion of the Mountain, and that  Kurdistan, from which I derive my descent, holds no family more noble  than that of Seljook.\"    \"I have heard,\" answered the Christian, \"that your great Soldan claims  his blood from the same source?\"    \"Thanks to the Prophet that hath so far honoured our mountains as to  send from their bosom him whose word is victory,\" answered the paynim.  \"I am but as a worm before the King of Egypt and Syria, and yet in my  own land something my name may avail. Stranger, with how many men didst  thou come on this warfare?\"    \"By my faith,\" said Sir Kenneth, \"with aid of friends and kinsmen, I was  hardly pinched to furnish forth ten well-appointed lances, with maybe  some fifty more men, archers and varlets included. Some have deserted  my unlucky pennon--some have fallen in battle--several have died of  disease--and one trusty armour-bearer, for whose life I am now doing my  pilgrimage, lies on the bed of sickness.\"    \"Christian,\" said Sheerkohf, \"here I have five arrows in my quiver,  each feathered from the wing of an eagle. When I send one of them to my  tents, a thousand warriors mount on horseback--when I send another, an  equal force will arise--for the five, I can command five thousand men;  and if I send my bow, ten thousand mounted riders will shake the desert.  And with thy fifty followers thou hast come to invade a land in which I  am one of the meanest!\"    \"Now, by the rood, Saracen,\" retorted the Western warrior, \"thou  shouldst know, ere thou vauntest thyself, that one steel glove can crush  a whole handful of hornets.\"    \"Ay, but it must first enclose them within its grasp,\" said the Saracen,  with a smile which might have endangered their new alliance, had he not  changed the subject by adding, \"And is bravery so much esteemed amongst  the Christian princes that thou, thus void of means and of men, canst  offer, as thou didst of late, to be my protector and security in the  camp of thy brethren?\"    \"Know, Saracen,\" said the Christian, \"since such is thy style, that the  name of a knight, and the blood of a gentleman, entitle him to place  himself on the same rank with sovereigns even of the first degree, in  so far as regards all but regal authority and dominion. Were Richard  of England himself to wound the honour of a knight as poor as I am, he  could not, by the law of chivalry, deny him the combat.\"    \"Methinks I should like to look upon so strange a scene,\" said the Emir,  \"in which a leathern belt and a pair of spurs put the poorest on a level  with the most powerful.\"    \"You must add free blood and a fearless heart,\" said the Christian;  \"then, perhaps, you will not have spoken untruly of the dignity of  knighthood.\"    \"And mix you as boldly amongst the females of your chiefs and leaders?\"  asked the Saracen.    \"God forbid,\" said the Knight of the Leopard, \"that the poorest knight  in Christendom should not be free, in all honourable service, to devote  his hand and sword, the fame of his actions, and the fixed devotion of  his heart, to the fairest princess who ever wore coronet on her brow!\"    \"But a little while since,\" said the Saracen, \"and you described love as  the highest treasure of the heart--thine hath undoubtedly been high and  nobly bestowed?\"    \"Stranger,\" answered the Christian, blushing deeply as he spoke, \"we  tell not rashly where it is we have bestowed our choicest treasures. It  is enough for thee to know that, as thou sayest, my love is highly and  nobly bestowed--most highly--most nobly; but if thou wouldst hear of  love and broken lances, venture thyself, as thou sayest, to the camp of  the Crusaders, and thou wilt find exercise for thine ears, and, if thou  wilt, for thy hands too.\"    The Eastern warrior, raising himself in his stirrups, and shaking aloft  his lance, replied, \"Hardly, I fear, shall I find one with a crossed  shoulder who will exchange with me the cast of the jerrid.\"    \"I will not promise for that,\" replied the Knight; \"though there be in  the camp certain Spaniards, who have right good skill in your Eastern  game of hurling the javelin.\"    \"Dogs, and sons of dogs!\" ejaculated the Saracen; \"what have these  Spaniards to do to come hither to combat the true believers, who, in  their own land, are their lords and taskmasters? with them I would mix  in no warlike pastime.\"    \"Let not the knights of Leon or Asturias hear you speak thus of them,\"  said the Knight of the Leopard. \"But,\" added he, smiling at the  recollection of the morning's combat, \"if, instead of a reed, you were  inclined to stand the cast of a battle-axe, there are enough of Western  warriors who would gratify your longing.\"    \"By the beard of my father, sir,\" said the Saracen, with an approach to  laughter, \"the game is too rough for mere sport. I will never shun them  in battle, but my head\" (pressing his hand to his brow) \"will not, for a  while, permit me to seek them in sport.\"    \"I would you saw the axe of King Richard,\" answered the Western warrior,  \"to which that which hangs at my saddle-bow weighs but as a feather.\"    \"We hear much of that island sovereign,\" said the Saracen. \"Art thou one  of his subjects?\"    \"One of his followers I am,"]]]
