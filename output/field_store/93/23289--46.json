It is probable before such an event took place, the coasts and  islands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that sea, and  were then for a great extent of country, destroyed by the floods  occasioned by the new rise of water, and have since remained beneath the  sea. Might not this give rise to the flood of Deucalion? See note  Cassia, V. II. of this work.]             \"Then, where Nemea's howling forests wave,       He drives the Lion to his dusky cave;  315  Seized by the throat the growling fiend disarms,       And tears his gaping jaws with sinewy arms;       Lifts proud ANTEUS from his mother-plains,       And with strong grasp the struggling Giant strains;       Back falls his fainting head, and clammy hair,  320  Writhe his weak limbs, and flits his life in air;--       By steps reverted o'er the blood-dropp'd fen       He tracks huge CACUS to his murderous den;       Where breathing flames through brazen lips he fled,       And shakes the rock-roof'd cavern o'er his head.    325    \"Last with wide arms the solid earth He tears,       Piles rock on rock, on mountain mountain rears;       Heaves up huge ABYLA on Afric's sand,       Crowns with high CALPE Europe's saliant strand,       Crests with opposing towers the splendid scene,  330  And pours from urns immense the sea between.--       --Loud o'er her whirling flood Charybdis roars,       Affrighted Scylla bellows round his shores,       Vesuvio groans through all his echoing caves,       And Etna thunders o'er the insurgent waves.    335    VII. 1. NYMPHS! YOUR fine hands ethereal floods amass       From the warm cushion, and the whirling glass;       Beard the bright cylinder with golden wire,       And circumfuse the gravitating fire.       Cold from each point cerulean lustres gleam,  340  Or shoot in air the scintillating stream.       So, borne on brazen talons, watch'd of old       The sleepless dragon o'er his fruits of gold;       Bright beam'd his scales, his eye-balls blazed with ire,       And his wide nostrils breath'd inchanted fire.      [_Ethereal floods amass_. l. 335. The theory of the accumulation of the  electric fluid by means of the glass-globe and cushion is difficult to  comprehend. Dr. Franklin's idea of the pores of the glass being opened  by the friction, and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric  fluid, which it again parts with, as the pores contract again, seems  analogous in some measure to the heat produced by the vibration, or  condensation of bodies, as when a nail is hammered or filed till it  becomes hot, as mentioned in additional Notes, No. VII. Some  philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phenomenon by  supposing the existence of two electric fluids which may be called the  vitreous and resinous ones, instead of the plus and minus of the same  ether. But its accumulation on the rubbed glass bears great analogy to  its accumulation on the surface of the Leyden bottle, and can not  perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle.  See note on Gymnotus. l. 202, of this Canto.]    [_Cold from each point_. l. 339. See additional note, No. XIII.]      345    \"YOU bid gold-leaves, in crystal lantherns held,       Approach attracted, and recede repel'd;       While paper-nymphs instinct with motion rife,       And dancing fauns the admiring Sage surprize.       OR, if on wax some fearless Beauty stand,  350  And touch the sparkling rod with graceful hand;       Through her fine limbs the mimic lightnings dart,       And flames innocuous eddy round her heart;       O'er her fair brow the kindling lustres glare,       Blue rays diverging from her bristling hair;  355  While some fond Youth the kiss ethereal sips.       And soft fires issue from their meeting lips.       So round the virgin Saint in silver streams       The holy Halo shoots it's arrowy beams.      [_You bid gold leaves_. l. 345. Alluding to the very sensible  electrometer improved by Mr. Bennett, it consists of two slips of gold-  leaf suspended from a tin cap in a glass cylinder, which has a partial  coating without, communicating with the wooden pedestal. If a stick of  sealing wax be rubbed for a moment on a dry cloth, and then held in the  air _at the distance of two or three feet_ from the cap of this  instrument, the gold leaves seperate, such is its astonishing  sensibility to electric influence! (See Bennet on electricity, Johnson,  Lond.) The nerves of sense of animal bodies do not seem to be affected  by less quantities of light or heat!]    [_The holy Halo_. l. 358. I believe it is not known with certainty at  what time the painters first introduced the luminous circle round the  head to import a Saint or holy person. It is now become a part of the  symbolic language of painting, and it is much to be wished that this  kind of hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art; as it is  much wanted to render historic pictures both more intelligible, and more  sublime; and why should not painting as well as poetry express itself in  metaphor, or in indistinct allegory? A truly great modern painter lately  endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of pictorial language, by putting a  demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed. Which  unfortunately for the scientific part of painting, the cold criticism of  the present day has depreciated; and thus barred perhaps the only road  to the further improvement in this science.]             \"YOU crowd in coated jars the denser fire,  360  Pierce the thin glass, and fuse the blazing wire;       Or dart the red flash through the circling band       Of youths and timorous damsels, hand in hand.       --Starts the quick Ether through the fibre-trains       Of dancing arteries, and of tingling veins,  365  Goads each fine nerve, with new sensation thrill'd,       Bends the reluctant limbs with power unwill'd;       Palsy's cold hands the fierce concussion own,       And Life clings trembling on her tottering throne.--       So from dark clouds the playful lightning springs,  370  Rives the firm oak, or prints the Fairy-rings.      [_With new sensation thrill'd_. l. 365. There is probably a system of  nerves in animal bodies for the purpose of perceiving heat; since the  degree of this fluid is so necessary to health that we become presently  injured either by its access or defect; and because almost every part of  our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves,  which would not seem necessary for their motion alone: It is therefore  probable, that our sensation of electricity is only of its violence in  passing through our system by its suddenly distending the muscles, like  any other mechanical violence; and that it is general pain alone that we  feel, and not any sensation analogous to the specific quality of the  object. Nature may seem to have been niggardly to mankind in bestowing  upon them so few senses; since a sense to have perceived electricity,  and another to have perceived magnetism might have been of great service  to them, many ages before these fluids were discovered by accidental  experiment, but it is possible an increased number of senses might have  incommoded us by adding to the size of our bodies.]    [_Palsy's cold hands_. l. 367. Paralytic limbs are in general only  incapable of being stimulated into action by the power of the will;  since the pulse continues to beat and the fluids to be absorbed in them;  and it commonly happens, when paralytic people yawn and stretch  themselves, (which is not a voluntary motion,) that the affected limb  moves at the same time. The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is  likewise caused by passing the electric shock through it; which would  seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid, and the  nervous fluid, which is seperated from the blood by the brain, and  thence diffused along the nerves for the purposes of motion and  sensation. It probably destroys life by its sudden expansion of the  nerves or fibres of the brain; in the same manner as it fuses metals and  splinters wood or stone, and removes the atmosphere, when it passes from  one object to another in a dense state.]    [_Prints the Fairy rings_. l. 370.

Cut your halibut into steaks or cutlets about an inch thick. Wipe  them with a dry cloth, and season them with salt and cayenne  pepper. Have ready a pan of yolk of egg well beaten, and a large  flat dish of grated bread crumbs.    Put some fresh lard or clarified beef dripping into a frying pan,  and hold it over a clear fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets into  the beaten egg, and then into the bread crumbs. Fry them of a  light brown. Serve them up hot, with the gravy in the bottom of  the dish.    Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner.    Halibut cutlets are very fine cut quite thin and fried in the best  sweet oil, omitting the egg and bread crumbs.      TO BROIL MACKEREL.    Mackerel cannot be eaten in perfection except at the sea-side,  where it can be had immediately out of the water. It loses its  flavour in a very few hours, and spoils sooner than any other  fish. Broiling is the best way of cooking it.    Clean two fine fresh mackerel, and wipe them dry with a cloth.  Split them open and rub them with salt. Spread some very bright  coals on the hearth, and set the gridiron over them well greased.  Lay on the mackerel, and broil them very nicely, taking care not  to let them burn. When one side is quite done, turn them on the  other. Lay them, on a hot dish, and butter and pepper them before  they go to table. Garnish them with lumps or pats of minced  paisley mixed with butter, pepper and salt.      BOILED MACKEREL.    Clean the mackerel well, and let them lie a short time in vinegar  and water. Then put them into the fish-kettle with cold water and  a handful of salt. Boil them slowly. If small, they will be  sufficiently cooked in twenty minutes. When the eye starts and the  tail splits they are done. Take them up immediately on finding  them boiled enough. If they stand any time in the water they will  break.    Serve them up with parsley sauce, and garnish the dish with lumps  of minced parsley.    They are eaten with mustard.    For boiling, choose those that have soft roes.    Another way is to put them in cold salt and water, and let them  warm gradually for an hour. Then give them one hard boil, and they  will be done.      TO BOIL SALT CODFISH.    The day previous to that on which it is to be eaten, take the fish  about four o'clock in the afternoon, and put it into a kettle of  cold water. Then place it within the kitchen fire-place, so as to  keep it blood-warm. Next morning at ten, take out the fish, scrub  it clean with a hard brash, and put it into a kettle of fresh cold  water, into which a jill of molasses has been stirred. The  molasses will be found an improvement. Place the kettle again near  the fire, until about twenty minutes before dinner. Then hang it  over the fire, and boil it hard a quarter of an hour, or a little  more.    When done, drain it, and cut it into large pieces. Wrap them  closely in a fine napkin and send them to table on a large dish,  garnished round the edge with hard-boiled eggs, either cut in  half, or in circular slices, yolks and whites together. Have ready  in a small tureen, egg-sauce made with, drawn butter, thickened  with hard-boiled eggs chopped fine. Place on one side of the fish  a dish of mashed potatoes, on the other a dish of boiled parsnips.    The most usual way of preparing salt cod for eating when it comes  to table, is (after picking out all the bones) to mince it fine on  your plate, and mix it with mashed potato, parsnip, and egg-sauce;  seasoning it to your taste with cayenne and mustard. What is left  may be prepared for breakfast nest morning. It should be put into  a skillet or spider, which must be well buttered inside, and set  over hot coals to warm and brown. Or it may be made up into small  cakes and fried.    You may add to the mixture onions boiled and chopped.      TO BOIL FRESH COD.    Having washed and cleaned the fish, leave out the roe and liver;  rub some salt on the inside, and if the weather is very cold you  may keep it till next day. Put sufficient water in the fish-kettle  to cover the fish very well, and add to the water a large handful  of salt. As soon as the salt is entirely melted put in the fish. A  very small codfish will be done in about twenty minutes, (after  the water has boiled;) a large one will take half an hour, or  more. Garnish with the roe and liver fried, or with scraped  horseradish. Send it to table with oyster-sauce in a boat. Or you  may make a sauce by flavouring your melted butter with a glass of  port wine, and an anchovy boned and minced.      ANOTHER WAY OF BOILING FRESH COD.    Put the fish into cold water with a handful of salt, and let it  slowly and gradually warm for three hours if the cod is large, and  two hours if it is small. Then increase the fire, and boil it hard  for a few minutes only.      BAKED SHAD.    Keep on the head and fins. Make a force-meat or stuffing of grated  bread crumbs, cold boiled ham or bacon minced fine, sweet  marjoram, pepper, salt, and a little powdered mace or cloves.  Moisten it with beaten yolk of egg. Stuff the inside of the fish  with it, reserving a little to rub over the outside, having first  rubbed the fish all over with yolk of egg. Lay the fish in a deep  pan, putting its tail to its mouth. Pour into the bottom of the  pan a little water, and add a jill of port wine, and a piece of  butter rolled in flour. Bake it well, and when it is done, send it  to table with the gravy poured round it. Garnish with slices of  lemon.    Any fish may be baked in the same manner.    A large fish of ten or twelve pounds weight, will require about  two hours baking.      TO BROIL A SHAD.    Split and wash the shad, and afterwards dry it in a cloth. Season  it with salt and pepper. Have ready a bed of clear bright coals.  Grease your gridiron well, and as soon as it is hot lay the shad  upon it, and broil it for about a. quarter of an hour or more,  according to the thickness. Butter it well, and send it to table.  You may serve with it melted butter in a sauce-boat.    Or you may cut it into three pieces and broil it without  splitting. It will then, of course, require a longer time. If done  in this manner, send it to table with melted butter poured over  it.      BOILED ROCK-FISH.    Having cleaned the rock-fish, put it into a fish-kettle with water  enough to cover it well, having first dissolved a handful of salt  in the water. Set it over a moderate fire, and do not let it boil  too fast. Skim it well.    When done, drain it, and put it on a large dish. Have ready a few  eggs boiled hard. Cut them in half, and lay them closely on the  back of the fish in a straight line from the head to the tail.  Send with it in a boat, celery sauce flavoured with a little  cayenne.      SEA BASS OR BLACK FISH.    May be boiled and served up in the above manner.      PICKLED ROCK-FISH.    Have ready a large rock-fish. Put on your fish-kettle with a  sufficiency of water to cover the fish amply; spring or pump water  is best. As soon as the water boils, throw in a tea-cup full of  salt, and put in the fish. Boil it gently for about half an hour,  skimming it well. Then take it out, and drain it, laying it  slantingly. Reserve a part of the water in which the fish has been  boiled, and season it to your taste with whole cloves, allspice,  and mace. Boil it up to extract the strength from the spice, and  after it has boiled add to it an equal quantity of the best  vinegar. You must have enough of this liquid to cover the fish  again. When the fish is quite cold, cut off the head and tail, and  cut the body into large pieces, extracting the back-bone. Put it  into a stone jar, and when the spiced liquor is cold, pour it on  the fish, cover the jar closely, and set it in a cool place. It  will be fit for use in a day or two, and if well secured from the  air, and put into a cold place will keep a fortnight.      FRIED PERCH.    Having cleaned the fish and dried them, with a cloth, lay them,  side by side, on a board or large dish; sprinkle them with salt,  and dredge them with flour. After a while turn them, and salt and  dredge the other side. Put some lard or fresh beef-dripping into a  frying-pan, and hold it over the fire. When the lard boils, put in  the fish and fry them of a yellowish brown. Send to table with  them in a boat, melted butter flavoured with anchovy.    Flounders or other small fish may be fried in the same manner.    You may know when the lard or dripping is hot enough, by dipping  in the tail of one of the fish. If it becomes crisp immediately,  the lard is in a proper state for frying. Or you may try it with a  piece of stale bread which will become brown directly, if the lard  is in order.    There should always be enough of lard to cover the fish entirely.  After they have fried five minutes on one side, turn them and fry  them five minutes on the other. Skim the lard or dripping always  before you put in the fish.      TO FRY TROUT.    Having cleaned the fish, and cut off the fins, dredge them with  flour. Have ready some beaten yolk of egg, and in a separate dish  some grated bread crumbs. Dip each fish into the egg, and then  strew them with bread crumbs. Put some butter or fresh beef-dripping  into a frying-pan, and hold it over the fire till it is  boiling hot; then, (having skimmed it,) put in the fish and fry  them.    Prepare some melted butter with a spoonful of mushroom-catchup and  a spoonful of lemon-pickle stirred into it. Send it to table in a  sauce-boat to eat with the fish.    You may fry carp and flounders in the same manner.      TO BOIL TROUT.    Put a handful of salt into the water. When it boils put in the  trout. Boil them fast about twenty minutes, according to their  size.    For sauce, send with them melted butter, and put some soy into it;  or flavour it with catchup.      FRIED SEA BASS.    Score the fish on the back with a knife, and season them with salt  and cayenne pepper. "]]]
