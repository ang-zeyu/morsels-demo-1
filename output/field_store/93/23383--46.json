She appeared vastly surprised  when he entered and asked for a manchet of bread, for the contrast  between his ruddy countenance and his Puritan hat and bands was so  striking that they could not fail to be noticed. The good woman looked  indeed too astonished to be able to attend to Harry's request, and he  was obliged to say, \"Mother, time presses, and I care not to be caught  loitering here.\"    Divining at once that he was acting a part, and probably endeavoring to  escape the pursuit of the Commons, the good woman at once served him  with bread and some slices of ham, and putting these in the wallets of  the saddle, he rode on.    The next morning, in riding through the village of Wickham, his career  was nearly arrested. Just as he passed a sergeant followed by three or  four Parliament soldiers came out from an inn, and seeing Harry riding  past, addressed him:    \"Sir, will it please you to alight, and to offer up a few words of  exhortation and prayer?\"    Harry muttered something about pressing business. But in his sudden  surprise he had not time to think of assuming either the nasal drone or  the scriptural words peculiar to these black-coated gentry. Struck by  his tone, the sergeant sprang forward and seized his bridle.    \"Whom have we here?\" he said; \"a lad masquerading in the dress of a  preacher. This must be explained, young sir.\"    \"Sergeant,\" Harry said, \"I doubt not that thou art a good fellow, and  not one to get a lad in a scrape. I am the son of a London citizen; but  he and my mother are at present greatly more occupied with the state of  their souls than with the carrying on of their carnal business. Being  young, the constant offering up of prayers and exhortations has vexed me  almost to desperation, and yesterday, while the good preacher who  attends then was in the midst of the third hour of his discourse I stole  downstairs, and borrowing his hat and cloak, together with his horse,  determined to set out to join my uncle, who is a farmer down in  Gloucestershire, and where in sooth the companionship of his  daughters--girls of my own age--suits my disposition greatly better than  that of the excellent men with whom my father consorts.\"    The soldiers laughed, and the sergeant, who was not at heart a bad  fellow, said:    \"I fear, my young sir, that your disposition is a godless one, and that  it would have been far better for you to have remained under the  ministration of the good man whose hat you are wearing than to have  sought the society of your pretty cousins. However, I do not know but  that in the unregenerate days of my own youth I might not have attempted  an escapade like yours. I trust,\" he continued, \"you are not tainted  with the evil doctrines of the adherents of King Charles.\"    \"In truth,\" Harry said, \"I worry not my head with politics. I hear so  much of them that I am fairly sick of the subject, and have not yet  decided whether the Commons is composed of an assembly of men directly  inspired with power for the regeneration of mankind, or whether King  Charles be a demon in human shape. Methinks that when I grow old enough  to bear arms it will be time enough for me to make up my mind against  whom to use them. At present, a clothyard is the stick to which I am  most accustomed, and as plows and harrows are greatly more in accord  with my disposition, I hope that for a long time I shall not see the  interior of a shop again; and I trust that the quarrels which have  brought such trouble into this realm, and have well-nigh made my father  and mother distraught, will at least favor my sojourn in the country,  for I am sure that my father will not venture to traverse England for  the sake of bringing me back again.\"    \"I am not sure,\" the sergeant said, \"that my duty would not be to  arrest you and to send you back to London. But as, in truth, I have no  instructions to hinder travelers, I must even let you go.\"    With a merry farewell to the group, and a laugh far more in accordance  with his years than with the costume which he wore, Harry set spurs to  his horse and again rode forward.    He met with no further adventure on the road. When he found by inquiries  that he had passed the outposts of the Parliament forces, he joyfully  threw the hat, the bands, and cloak into a ditch, for experience had  taught him that, however useful as a passport they might be while still  within the lines of the troops of the Commons, they would be likely to  procure him but scant welcome when he entered those of the Royalists.  Round Oxford the royal army were encamped, and Harry speedily discovered  that his father was with his troop at his own place. Turning his head  again eastward, he rode to Abingdon, and quickly afterward was at the  hall.    The shout of welcome which the servitor who opened the door uttered when  he saw him speedily brought his father to the entrance, and Sir Henry  was overjoyed at seeing the son whom he believed to be in confinement in  London. Harry's tale was soon told, and the colonel roared with laughter  at the thought of his boy masquerading as a Puritan preacher.    \"King Charles himself,\" he said, \"might smile over your story, Harry;  and in faith it takes a great deal to call up a smile into his majesty's  face, which is, methinks a pity, for he would be more loved, and not  less respected, did he, by his appearance and manner, do something to  raise the spirits of those around him.\"    When once seated in the hall Harry inquired of his father what progress  had been made since he was taken prisoner, for he had heard nothing from  his guards.    \"Things are as they were,\" his father said. \"After our unfortunate  advance we fell back hither, and for six weeks nothing was done. A  fortnight since, on the 2d of January, a petition was brought by  deputies from the Common Council of London, asking the king to return to  the capital when all disturbance should be suppressed. King Charles,  however, knew not that these gentlemen had the power to carry out their  promises seeing that the seditious have the upper hand in the capital,  and answered them to that effect. His answer was, however, methinks, far  less conciliatory and prudent than it might have been, for it boots not  to stir up men's minds unnecessarily, and with a few affectionate words  the king might have strengthened his party in London. The result,  however, was to lead to a fierce debate, in which Pym and Lord  Manchester addressed the multitude, and stirred them up to indignation,  and I fear that prospects of peace are further away than ever. In other  respects there is good and bad news. Yorkshire and Cheshire, Devon and  Cornwall, have all declared for the crown; but upon the other hand, in  the east the prospects are most gloomy. There, the seven counties,  Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridge, Herts, Lincoln, and Huntingdon, have  joined themselves into an association, and the king's followers dare not  lift their heads. At Lichfield, Lord Brook, a fierce opponent of bishops  and cathedrals, while besieging a party of Cavaliers who had taken  possession of the close, was shot in the eye and killed. These are the  only incidents that have taken place.\"    For some weeks no event of importance occurred. On the 22d of February  the queen, who had been absent on the Continent selling her jewels and  endeavoring to raise a force, landed at Burlington, with four ships,  having succeeded in evading the ships of war which the Commons had  dispatched to cut her off, under the command of Admiral Batten. That  night, however, the Parliament fleet arrived off the place, and opened  fire upon the ships and village. The queen was in a house near the  shore, and the balls struck in all directions round. She was forced to  get up, throw on a few clothes, and retire on foot to some distance from  the village to the shelter of a ditch, where she sat for two hours, the  balls sometimes striking dust over them, and singing round in all  directions. It was a question whether the small force which the queen  brought with her was not rather a hindrance than an assistance to the  royal cause, for the Earl of Newcastle, who had been sent to escort her  to York, was authorized by the king to raise men for the service,  without examining their consciences, that is to say, to receive  Catholics as well as Protestants. The Parliament took advantage of this  to style his army the Catholic Army, and this, and some tamperings with  the Papists in Ireland, increased the popular belief that the king  leaned toward Roman Catholicism, and thus heightened the feelings  against him, and embittered the religious as well as the political  quarrel.    Toward the end of March commissioners from the Parliament, under the  Earl of Northumberland, came to Oxford with propositions to treat. It is  questionable whether the offers of the Commons were sincere. But  Charles, by his vacillation and hesitation, by yielding one day and  retracting the next, gave them the opportunity of asserting, with some  show of reason, that he was wholly insincere, and could not be trusted;  and so the commission was recalled, and the war went on again.    On the 15th of April Parliament formally declared the negotiations to be  at an end, and on that day Essex marched with his army to the siege of  Reading. The place was fortified, and had a resolute garrison; but by  some gross oversight no provisions or stores had been collected, and  after an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the town, when the Royalist  forces failed to carry the bridge at Caversham, they fell back upon  Wallingford, and Reading surrendered. Meanwhile skirmishes were going on  all over the country. Sir William Waller was successful against the  Royalists in the south and west. In the north Lord Newcastle was opposed  to Fairfax, and the result was doubtful; while in Cornwall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11568"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 562, (#8)"],[1,"used to be ten or fifteen years before; a black  stock, very narrow; a dark-blue velvet cap with a shade, and a very  rich gold band and large gold tassel at the crown; nankeen gaiters,  and a pair of blue spectacles, completed his costume, which was any  thing but becoming. This was his general dress of a morning for  riding, but I have seen it changed for a green tartan plaid jacket. He  did not ride well, which surprised us, as, from the frequent allusions  to horsemanship in his works, we expected to find him almost a Nimrod,  It was evident that he had _pretensions_ on this point, though he  certainly was what I should call a timid rider. When his horse made a  false step, which was not unfrequent, he seemed discomposed; and when  we came to any bad part of the road, he immediately checked his course  and walked his horse very slowly, though there really was nothing to  make even a lady nervous. Finding that I could perfectly manage (or  what he called _bully_) a very highly-dressed horse that I daily rode,  he became extremely anxious to buy it; asked me a thousand questions  as to how I had acquired such a perfect command of it, &c. &c. and  entreated, as the greatest favour, that I would resign it to him as a  charger to take to Greece, declaring he never would part with it, &c.  As I was by no means a bold rider, we were rather amused at observing  Lord Byron's opinion of my courage; and as he seemed so anxious for  the horse, I agreed to let him have it when he was to embark. From  this time he paid particular attention to the movements of poor  Mameluke (the name of the horse), and said he should now feel  confidence in action with so steady a charger.    _April_--. Lord Byron dined with us today. During dinner he was as  usual gay, spoke in terms of the warmest commendation of Sir Walter  Scott, not only as an author, but as a man, and dwelt with apparent  delight on his novels, declaring that he had read and re-read them  over and over again, and always with increased pleasure. He said  that he quite equalled, nay, in his opinion, surpassed Cervantes. In  talking of Sir Walter's private character, goodness of heart, &c.,  Lord Byron became more animated than I had ever seen him; his colour  changed from its general pallid tint to a more lively hue, and his  eyes became humid: never had he appeared to such advantage, and it  might easily be seen that every expression he uttered proceeded from  his heart. Poor Byron!--for poor he is even with all his genius, rank,  and wealth--had he lived more with men like Scott, whose openness of  character and steady principle had convinced him that they were in  earnest in _their goodness_, and not _making believe_, (as he always  suspects good people to be,) his life might be different and happier!  Byron is so acute an observer that nothing escapes him; all the shades  of selfishness and vanity are exposed to his searching glance, and the  misfortune is, (and a serious one it is to him,) that when he finds  these, and alas! they are to be found on every side, they disgust  and prevent his giving credit to the many good qualities that often  accompany them. He declares he can sooner pardon crimes, because they  proceed from the passions, than these minor vices, that spring from  egotism and self-conceit. We had a long argument this evening on the  subject, which ended, like most arguments, by leaving both of the same  opinion as when it commenced. I endeavoured to prove that crimes were  not only injurious to the perpetrators, but often ruinous to the  innocent, and productive of misery to friends and relations, whereas  selfishness and vanity carried with them their own punishment, the  first depriving the person of all sympathy, and the second exposing  him to ridicule which to the vain is a heavy punishment, but that  their effects were not destructive to society as are crimes.    He laughed when I told him that having heard him so often declaim  against vanity, and detect it so often in his friends, I began to  suspect he knew the malady by having had it himself, and that I had  observed through life, that those persons who had the most vanity were  the most severe against that failing in their friends. He wished to  impress upon me that he was not vain, and gave various proofs to  establish this; but I produced against him his boasts of swimming, his  evident desire of being considered more _un homme de societe_ than a  poet, and other little examples, when he laughingly pleaded guilty,  and promised to be more merciful towards his friends.    Byron attempted to be gay, but the effort was not successful, and he  wished us good night with a trepidation of manner that marked his  feelings. And this is the man that I have heard considered unfeeling!  How often are our best qualities turned against us, and made the  instruments for wounding us in the most vulnerable part, until,  ashamed of betraying our susceptibility, we affect an insensibility  we are far from possessing, and, while we deceive others, nourish in  secret the feelings that prey _only_ on our own hearts!    --_New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.      _Canary Birds._--In Germany and the Tyrol, from whence the rest of  Europe is principally supplied with Canary birds, the apparatus for  breeding Canaries is both large and expensive. A capacious building  is erected for them, with a square space at each end, and holes  communicating with these spaces. In these outlets are planted such  trees as the birds prefer. The bottom is strewed with sand, on which  are cast rapeseed, chickweed, and such other food as they like.  Throughout the inner compartment, which is kept dark, are placed  bowers for the birds to build in, care being taken that the breeding  birds are guarded from the intrusion of the rest. Four Tyrolese  usually take over to England about sixteen hundred of these birds; and  though they carry them on their backs nearly a thousand miles, and pay  twenty pounds for them originally, they can sell them at 5_s_. each.    _Braithwaite's Steam Fire Engine_--will deliver about 9,000 gallons  of water per hour to an elevation of 90 feet. The time of getting the  machine into action, from the moment of igniting the fuel, (the water  being cold,) is 18 minutes. As soon as an alarm is given, the fire is  kindled, and the bellows, attached to the engine, are worked by hand.  By the time the horses are harnessed in, the fuel is thoroughly  ignited, and the bellows are then worked by the motion of the wheels  of the engine. By the time of arriving at the fire, preparing the  hoses, &c. the steam is ready.    Fisher, bishop of Rochester, was accustomed to style his church his  wife, declaring that he would never exchange her for one that was  richer. He was a zealous adherent of Pope Paul III. who created him  a cardinal. The king, Henry VIII., on learning that Fisher would not  refuse the dignity, exclaimed, in a passion, \"Yea! is he so lusty?  Well, let the pope send him a hat when he will. Mother of God! he  shall wear it on his shoulders, for I will leave him never a head to  set it on.\"    _Flax_ is not uncommon in the greenhouses about Philadelphia, but  we have not heard of any experiments with it in the open  air.--_Encyclopaedia Americana._    _The Schoolmaster wanted in the East._--Mr. Madden, in his travels  in Turkey, Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine, says:--\"In all my travels, I  could only meet one woman who could read and write, and that was in  Damietta; she was a Levantine Christian, and her peculiar talent was  looked upon as something superhuman.\"    La Fontaine had but one son, whom, at the age of 14, he placed in the  hands of Harlay, archbishop of Paris, who promised to provide for him.  After a long absence, La Fontaine met this youth at the house of a  friend, and being pleased with his conversation, was told that it was  his own son. \"Ah,\" said he, \"I am very glad of it.\"    _Universal Genius._--Rivernois thus describes the character of  Fontenelle: \"When Fontenelle appeared on the field, all the prizes  were already distributed, all the palms already gathered: the prize of  universality alone remained, Fontenelle determined to attempt it, and  he was successful. He is not only a metaphysician with Malebranche, a  natural philosopher with Newton, a legislator with Peter the Great, a  statesman with D'Argenson; he is everything with everybody.\"    _Forest Schools._--There are a number of forest academies in Germany,  particularly in the small states of central Germany, in the Hartz,  Thuringia, &c. The principal branches taught in them are the  following:--forest botany, mineralogy, zoology, chemistry; by which  the learner is taught the natural history of forests, and the mutual  relations, &c. of the different kingdoms of nature. He is also  instructed in the care and chase of game, and in the surveying and  cultivation of forests, so as to understand the mode of raising all  kinds of wood, and supplying a new growth as fast as the old is taken  away. The pupil is too instructed in the administration of the forest  taxes and police, and all that relates to forests considered as a  branch of revenue.    _The Weather._--Meteorological journals are now given in most  magazines. The first statement of this kind was communicated by Dr.  Fothergill to the Gentleman's Magazine, and consisted of a monthly  account of the weather and diseases of London. The latter information  is now monopolized by the parish-clerks.    _Goethe._--The wife of a Silesian peasant, being obliged to go to  Saxony, and hearing that she had travelled (on foot) more than half  the distance to Goethe's residence, whose works she had read with the  liveliest interest, continued her journey to Weimar for the sake of  seeing him. Goethe declared that the true character of his works had  never been better understood than by this woman. He gave her his"]]]
