One  morning he saw Teeka squatted upon a low branch hugging something very  close to her hairy breast--a wee something which squirmed and wriggled.  Tarzan approached filled with the curiosity which is common to all  creatures endowed with brains which have progressed beyond the  microscopic stage.    Teeka rolled her eyes in his direction and strained the squirming mite  still closer to her.  Tarzan came nearer.  Teeka drew away and bared  her fangs.  Tarzan was nonplussed.  In all his experiences with Teeka,  never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today  she did not look playful.  Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his  thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared.  Then he  edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing  which Teeka cuddled.    Again Teeka drew back her upper lip in a warning snarl.  Tarzan reached  forth a hand, cautiously, to touch the thing which Teeka held, and  Teeka, with a hideous growl, turned suddenly upon him.  Her teeth sank  into the flesh of his forearm before the ape-man could snatch it away,  and she pursued him for a short distance as he retreated incontinently  through the trees; but Teeka, carrying her baby, could not overtake  him.  At a safe distance Tarzan stopped and turned to regard his  erstwhile play-fellow in unconcealed astonishment.  What had happened  to so alter the gentle Teeka? She had so covered the thing in her arms  that Tarzan had not yet been able to recognize it for what it was; but  now, as she turned from the pursuit of him, he saw it.  Through his  pain and chagrin he smiled, for Tarzan had seen young ape mothers  before.  In a few days she would be less suspicious.  Still Tarzan was  hurt; it was not right that Teeka, of all others, should fear him.  Why, not for the world would he harm her, or her balu, which is the ape  word for baby.    And now, above the pain of his injured arm and the hurt to his pride,  rose a still stronger desire to come close and inspect the new-born son  of Taug.  Possibly you will wonder that Tarzan of the Apes, mighty  fighter that he was, should have fled before the irritable attack of a  she, or that he should hesitate to return for the satisfaction of his  curiosity when with ease he might have vanquished the weakened mother  of the new-born cub; but you need not wonder.  Were you an ape, you  would know that only a bull in the throes of madness will turn upon a  female other than to gently chastise her, with the occasional exception  of the individual whom we find exemplified among our own kind, and who  delights in beating up his better half because she happens to be  smaller and weaker than he.    Tarzan again came toward the young mother--warily and with his line of  retreat safely open.  Again Teeka growled ferociously.  Tarzan  expostulated.    \"Tarzan of the Apes will not harm Teeka's balu,\" he said.  \"Let me see  it.\"    \"Go away!\" commanded Teeka.  \"Go away, or I will kill you.\"    \"Let me see it,\" urged Tarzan.    \"Go away,\" reiterated the she-ape. \"Here comes Taug.  He will make you  go away.  Taug will kill you.  This is Taug's balu.\"    A savage growl close behind him apprised Tarzan of the nearness of  Taug, and the fact that the bull had heard the warnings and threats of  his mate and was coming to her succor.    Now Taug, as well as Teeka, had been Tarzan's play-fellow while the  bull was still young enough to wish to play.  Once Tarzan had saved  Taug's life; but the memory of an ape is not overlong, nor would  gratitude rise above the parental instinct.  Tarzan and Taug had once  measured strength, and Tarzan had been victorious.  That fact Taug  could be depended upon still to remember; but even so, he might readily  face another defeat for his first-born--if he chanced to be in the  proper mood.    From his hideous growls, which now rose in strength and volume, he  seemed to be in quite the mood.  Now Tarzan felt no fear of Taug, nor  did the unwritten law of the jungle demand that he should flee from  battle with any male, unless he cared to from purely personal reasons.  But Tarzan liked Taug.  He had no grudge against him, and his man-mind  told him what the mind of an ape would never have deduced--that Taug's  attitude in no sense indicated hatred.  It was but the instinctive urge  of the male to protect its offspring and its mate.    Tarzan had no desire to battle with Taug, nor did the blood of his  English ancestors relish the thought of flight, yet when the bull  charged, Tarzan leaped nimbly to one side, and thus encouraged, Taug  wheeled and rushed again madly to the attack.  Perhaps the memory of a  past defeat at Tarzan's hands goaded him.  Perhaps the fact that Teeka  sat there watching him aroused a desire to vanquish the ape-man before  her eyes, for in the breast of every jungle male lurks a vast egotism  which finds expression in the performance of deeds of derring-do before  an audience of the opposite sex.    At the ape-man's side swung his long grass rope--the play-thing of  yesterday, the weapon of today--and as Taug charged the second time,  Tarzan slipped the coils over his head and deftly shook out the sliding  noose as he again nimbly eluded the ungainly beast.  Before the ape  could turn again, Tarzan had fled far aloft among the branches of the  upper terrace.    Taug, now wrought to a frenzy of real rage, followed him.  Teeka peered  upward at them.  It was difficult to say whether she was interested.  Taug could not climb as rapidly as Tarzan, so the latter reached the  high levels to which the heavy ape dared not follow before the former  overtook him.  There he halted and looked down upon his pursuer, making  faces at him and calling him such choice names as occurred to the  fertile man-brain. Then, when he had worked Taug to such a pitch of  foaming rage that the great bull fairly danced upon the bending limb  beneath him, Tarzan's hand shot suddenly outward, a widening noose  dropped swiftly through the air, there was a quick jerk as it settled  about Taug, falling to his knees, a jerk that tightened it securely  about the hairy legs of the anthropoid.    Taug, slow of wit, realized too late the intention of his tormentor.  He scrambled to escape, but the ape-man gave the rope a tremendous jerk  that pulled Taug from his perch, and a moment later, growling  hideously, the ape hung head downward thirty feet above the ground.    Tarzan secured the rope to a stout limb and descended to a point close  to Taug.    \"Taug,\" he said, \"you are as stupid as Buto, the rhinoceros.  Now you  may hang here until you get a little sense in your thick head.  You may  hang here and watch while I go and talk with Teeka.\"    Taug blustered and threatened, but Tarzan only grinned at him as he  dropped lightly to the lower levels.  Here he again approached Teeka  only to be again greeted with bared fangs and menacing growls.  He  sought to placate her; he urged his friendly intentions, and craned his  neck to have a look at Teeka's balu; but the she-ape was not to be  persuaded that he meant other than harm to her little one.  Her  motherhood was still so new that reason was yet subservient to instinct.    Realizing the futility of attempting to catch and chastise Tarzan,  Teeka sought to escape him.  She dropped to the ground and lumbered  across the little clearing about which the apes of the tribe were  disposed in rest or in the search of food, and presently Tarzan  abandoned his attempts to persuade her to permit a close examination of  the balu.  The ape-man would have liked to handle the tiny thing.  The  very sight of it awakened in his breast a strange yearning.  He wished  to cuddle and fondle the grotesque little ape-thing. It was Teeka's  balu and Tarzan had once lavished his young affections upon Teeka.    But now his attention was diverted by the voice of Taug.  The threats  that had filled the ape's mouth had turned to pleas.  The tightening  noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his legs--he was  beginning to suffer.  Several apes sat near him highly interested in  his predicament.  They made uncomplimentary remarks about him, for each  of them had felt the weight of Taug's mighty hands and the strength of  his great jaws.  They were enjoying revenge.    Teeka, seeing that Tarzan had turned back toward the trees, had halted  in the center of the clearing, and there she sat hugging her balu and  casting suspicious glances here and there.  With the coming of the  balu, Teeka's care-free world had suddenly become peopled with  innumerable enemies.  She saw an implacable foe in Tarzan, always  heretofore her best friend.  Even poor old Mumga, half blind and almost  entirely toothless, searching patiently for grubworms beneath a fallen  log, represented to her a malignant spirit thirsting for the blood of  little balus.    And while Teeka guarded suspiciously against harm, where there was no  harm, she failed to note two baleful, yellow-green eyes staring fixedly  at her from behind a clump of bushes at the opposite side of the  clearing.    Hollow from hunger, Sheeta, the panther, glared greedily at the  tempting meat so close at hand, but the sight of the great bulls beyond  gave him pause.    Ah, if the she-ape with her balu would but come just a trifle nearer! A  quick spring and he would be upon them and away again with his meat  before the bulls could prevent.    The tip of his tawny tail moved in spasmodic little jerks; his lower  jaw hung low, exposing a red tongue and yellow fangs.  But all this  Teeka did not see, nor did any other of the apes who were feeding or  resting about her.  Nor did Tarzan or the apes in the trees.    Hearing the abuse which the bulls were pouring upon the helpless Taug,  Tarzan clambered quickly among them.  One was edging closer and leaning  far out in an effort to reach the dangling ape.  He had worked himself  into quite a fury through "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#8)"],[1,"of yours, Oscar Larsen. Judge Lodge, they  ain't nobody but you that talks about 'justice' and 'voices.' Buck  Mason, I could tell you by your build, a mile off. Montana, you'd ought  to have masked your neck and your Adam's apple sooner'n your face. And  you're Bill Sandersen. They ain't any other man in these parts that  stands on one heel and points his off toe like a horse with a sore leg.  I know you all, and, if you touch a hair on Jig's head, I'll have you  into court for murder! You hear--murder! I'll have you hung, every man  jack!\"    She had lowered her voice for the last part of this speech. Now she  made a sweeping gesture, closing her hand as if she had clutched their  destinies in the palm of her hand and could throw it into their faces.    \"You-all climb right back on your hosses and feed 'em the spur.\"    They stood amazed, shifting from foot to foot, exchanging miserable  glances. She began to laugh; mysterious lights danced and twinkled in  her eyes. The laughter chimed away into words grown suddenly gentle,  suddenly friendly. Such a voice Riley Sinclair had never heard. It  walked into a man's heart, breaking the lock.    \"Why, Buck Mason, you of all men to be mixed up in a deal like this.  And you, Oscar Larsen, after you and me had talked like partners so  many a time! Denver Jim, we'll have a good laugh about this necktie  party later on. Why, boys, you-all know that Jig ain't guilty of no  harm!\"    \"Sally,\" said the wretched Denver Jim, \"things seemed to be sort of  pointing to a--\"    There was a growl from the rear of the party, and Riley Sinclair strode  to the front and faced the girl. \"They's a gent charged with murder  inside,\" he said. \"Stand off, girl. You're in the way!\"    Before she answered him, her teeth glinted. If she had been a man, she  would have struck him in the face. He saw that, and it pleased him.    \"Stranger,\" she said deliberately, making sure that every one in the  party should hear her words, \"what you need is a stay around Sour Creek  long enough for the boys to teach you how to talk to a lady.\"    \"Honey,\" replied Riley Sinclair with provoking calm, \"you sure put up a  tidy bluff. Maybe you'd tell a judge that you knowed all these gents  behind their masks, but they wouldn't be no way you could _prove_ it!\"    A stir behind him was ample assurance that this simple point had  escaped the cowpunchers. All the soul of the girl stood up in her eyes  and hated Riley Sinclair, and again he was pleased. It was not that he  wished to bring the schoolteacher to trouble, but it had angered him to  see one girl balk seven grown men.    \"Stand aside,\" said Riley Sinclair.    \"Not an inch!\"    \"Lady, I'll move you.\"    \"Stranger, if you touch me, you'll be taught better. The gents in Sour  Creek don't stand for suchlike ways!\"    Before the appeal to the chivalry of Sour Creek was out of her lips,  smoothly and swiftly the hands of Sinclair settled around her elbows.  She was lifted lightly into the air and deposited to one side of the  doorway.    Her cry rang in the ears of Riley Sinclair. Then her hand flashed up,  and the mask was torn from his face.    \"I'll remember! Oh, if I have to wait twenty years, I'll remember!\"    \"Look me over careful, lady. Today's most likely the last time you'll  see me,\" declared Riley, gazing straight into her eyes.    A hand touched his arm. \"Stranger, no rough play!\"    Riley Sinclair whirled with whiplash suddenness and, chopping the edge  of his hand downward, struck away the arm of Larsen, paralyzing the  nerves with the same blow.    \"Hands off!\" said Sinclair.    The girl's clear voice rang again in his ear: \"Thank you, Oscar Larsen.  I sure know my friends--and the gentlemen!\"    She was pouring oil on the fire. She would have a feud blazing in a  moment. With all his heart Riley Sinclair admired her dexterity. He  drew the posse back to the work in hand by stepping into the doorway  and calling: \"Hey, Gaspar!\"          7      \"He's right, Larsen, and you're wrong,\" Buck Mason said.    \"She had us buffaloed, and he pulled us clear. Steady, boys. They ain't  no harm done to Sally!\"    \"Oh, Buck, is that the sort of a friend of mine you are?\"    \"I'm sorry, Sally.\"    Sinclair gave this argument only a small part of his attention. He  found himself looking over a large room which was, he thought, one of  the most comfortable he had ever seen--outside of pictures. At the  farther end a great fireplace filled the width of the room. The inside  of the log walls had been carefully and smoothly finished by some  master axman. There were plenty of chairs, homemade and very  comfortable with cushions. A little organ stood against the wall to one  side. No wonder the schoolteacher had chosen this for his boarding  place!    Riley made his voice larger. \"Gaspar!\"    Then a door opened slowly, while Sinclair dropped his hand on the butt  of his gun and waited. The door moved again. A head appeared and  observed him.    \"Pronto!\" declared Riley Sinclair, and a little man slipped into full  view.    He was a full span shorter, Riley felt, than a man had any right to be.  Moreover, he was too delicately made. He had a head of bright blond  hair, thick and rather on end. The face was thin and handsome, and the  eyes impressed Riley as being at once both bright and weary. He was  wearing a dressing gown, the first Riley had ever seen.    \"Get your hands out of those pockets!\" He emphasized the command with a  jerk of his gun hand, and the arms of the schoolteacher flew up over  his head. Lean, fragile hands, Riley saw them to be. Altogether it was  the most disgustingly inefficient piece of manhood that he had ever  seen.    \"Slide out here, Gaspar. They's some gents here that wants to look you  over.\"    The voice that answered him was pitched so low as to be almost  unintelligible. \"What do they want?\"    \"Step lively, friend! They want to see a gent that lets a woman do his  fighting for him.\"    He had dropped his gun contemptuously back into its holster. Now he  waved the schoolteacher to the door with his bare hands.    Gaspar sidled past as if a loaded gun were about to explode in his  direction. He reached the door, his arms still held stiffly above his  head, but, at the sight of the masked faces, one arm dropped to his  side, and the other fell across his face. He slumped against the side  of the door with a moan.    It was Judge Lodge who broke the silence. \"Guilty, boys. Ain't one look  at the skunk enough to prove it?\"    \"Make it all fair and legal, gents,\" broke in Larsen.    Buck Mason strode straight up to the prisoner.    \"Was you over to Quade's house yesterday evening?\"    The other shrank away from the extended, pointing arm.    \"Yes,\" he stammered. \"I--I--what does all this mean?\"    Mason whirled on his companions, still pointing to the schoolmaster.  \"Take a slant at him, boys. Can't you read it in his face?\"    There was a deep and humming murmur of approval. Then, without a word,  Mason took one of Gaspar's arms and Montana took the other. Sally Bent  ran forward at them with a cry, but the long arm of Riley Sinclair  barred her way.    \"Man's work,\" he said coldly. \"You go inside and cover your head.\"    She turned to them with extended hands.    \"Buck, Montana, Larsen--boys, you-all ain't going to let it happen? He  _couldn't_ have done it!\"    They lowered their heads and returned no answer. At that she whirled  with a sob and ran back into the house. The procession moved on, Buck  and Montana in the lead, with the prisoner between them. The others  followed, Judge Lodge uncoiling a horribly significant rope. Last of  all came Bill Sandersen, never taking his eyes from the face of Riley  Sinclair.    The latter was thoughtful, very thoughtful. He seemed to feel the eyes  of Sandersen upon him, for presently he turned to the other. \"What  good's a coward to the world, Sandersen?\"    \"None that I could see.\"    \"Well, look at that. Ever see anything more yaller?\"    Gaspar walked between his two guards. Rather he was dragged between  them, his feet trailing weakly and aimlessly behind him, his whole body  sinking with flabby terror. The stern lip of Riley Sinclair curled.    \"He's going to let it go through,\" said Sandersen to himself. \"After  all nobody can blame him. He couldn't put his own neck in the noose.\"    Over the lowest limb of a great cottonwood Judge Lodge accurately flung  the rope, so that the noose dangled a significant distance from the  ground. There was a businesslike stir among the others. Denver, Larsen,  the judge, and Sandersen held the free end of the rope. Buck Mason tied  the hands of the prisoner behind him. Montana spoke calmly through his  mask.    \"Jig, you sure done a rotten bad thing. You hadn't ought to of killed  him, Jig. These here killings has got to stop. We ain't hanging you for  spite, but to make an example.\"    Then with a dexterous hand he fitted the noose around the neck of the  schoolteacher. As the rough rope grated against Gaspar's throat, he  shrieked and jerked against the rope end that bound his hands. Then, as  if he realized that struggling would not help him, and that only speech  could give him a chance for life, he checked the cry of horror and  looked around him. His glances fell on the grim masks, and it was only  natural that he should address himself to the only uncovered face he  saw.    \"Sir,\" he said to Riley in a rapid, trembling voice, \"you look to me  like an honest man. Give me--give me time to speak.\"    \"Make it pronto,\" said Riley Sinclair coldly.    The four waited, with their hands settled high up on the rope, ready  for the tug which would swing Gaspar halfway to his Maker.    \"We're kind of pushed for time, ourselves,\" said Riley. \"So hurry it  on, Gaspar.\"    Bill Sandersen was a cold man, but such unbelievable heartlessness  chilled him. Into his mind rushed a temptation suddenly to denounce the  real slayer before them all. He checked"]]]
