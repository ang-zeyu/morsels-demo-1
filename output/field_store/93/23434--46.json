It is bad enough to see  young and foolish creatures puffed up with pride, but it is worse to see  any one as old as Old Mr. Toad that way. He held his head so high that he  couldn't see his own feet, and more than once he stubbed his toes.  Presently he met his old friend, Danny Meadow Mouse. He tipped his head a  little higher, puffed himself out a little more, and pretended not to see  Danny.    \"Hello, Mr. Toad,\" said Danny.    Mr. Toad pretended not to hear. Danny looked puzzled. Then he spoke again,  and this time he shouted: \"Hello, Mr. Toad! I haven't seen you for some  time.\"    It wouldn't do to pretend not to hear this time. \"Oh, how do you do,  Danny?\" said Old Mr. Toad with a very grand air, and pretending to be much  surprised. \"Sorry I can't stop, but I've been dining with, my friend,  Buster Bear, and now I must get home.\" When he mentioned the name of Buster  Bear, he puffed himself out a little more.    Danny grinned as he watched him hop on down the Lone Little Path. \"Can't  talk with common folks any more,\" he muttered. \"I've heard that pride is  very apt to turn people's heads, but I never expected to see Old Mr. Toad  proud.\"    [Illustration: \"Can't talk with common folks any more,\" he muttered.]    Mr. Toad kept on his way, and presently he met Peter Rabbit. Peter stopped  to gossip, as is his way. But Old Mr. Toad took no notice of him at all. He  kept right on with his head high, and all puffed out. Peter might have been  a stick or a stone for all the notice Old Mr. Toad took of him. Peter  looked puzzled. Then he hurried down to tell Danny Meadow Mouse about it.    \"Oh,\" said Danny, \"he's been to dine with Buster Bear, and now he has no  use for his old friends.\"    Pretty soon along came Johnny Chuck, and he was very much put out because  he had been treated by Old Mr. Toad just as Peter Rabbit had. Striped  Chipmunk told the same story. So did Unc' Billy Possum. It was the same  with all of Old Mr. Toad's old friends and neighbors, excepting Bobby Coon,  who, you know, is Buster Bear's little cousin. To him Old Mr. Toad was very  polite and talked a great deal about Buster Bear, and thought that Bobby  must be very proud to be related to Buster.    At first everybody thought it a great joke to see Old Mr. Toad so puffed up  with, pride, but after a little they grew tired of being snubbed by their  old friend and neighbor, and began to say unpleasant things about him. Then  they decided that what Old Mr. Toad needed was a lesson, so they put their  heads together and planned how they would teach Old Mr. Toad how foolish it  is for any one to be puffed up with pride.          XXI      OLD MR. TOAD RECEIVES ANOTHER INVITATION    The friends and neighbors of Old Mr. Toad decided that he needed to be  taught a lesson. At first, you know, every one had laughed at him, because  he had grown too proud to speak to them, but after a little they grew tired  of being treated so, and some of them put their heads together to think of  some plan to teach Old Mr. Toad a lesson and what a very, very foolish  thing false pride is. The very next day Jimmy Skunk went into the Green  Forest to look for Buster Bear. You know Jimmy isn't afraid of Buster. He  didn't have to look long, and when he had found him, the very first thing  he did was to ask Buster if he had seen any fat beetles that morning. You  know Jimmy is very fond of fat beetles, and the first thing he asks any one  he may happen to meet is if they have seen any.    Buster Bear grinned and said he thought he knew where there might be a few,  and he would be pleased to have Jimmy go with him to see. Sure enough,  under an old log he found five fat beetles, and these Jimmy gobbled up  without even asking Buster if he would have one. Jimmy is usually very  polite, but this time he quite forgot politeness. I am afraid he is rather  apt to when fat beetles are concerned. But Buster didn't seem to mind. When  the last beetle had disappeared Jimmy smacked his lips, and then he told  Buster Bear what he had come for. Of course, at first Buster had thought it  was for the fat beetles. But it wasn't. No, Sir, it wasn't for the fat  beetles at all. It was to get Buster Bear's help in a plan to teach Old Mr.  Toad a lesson.    First Jimmy told Buster all about how puffed up Old Mr. Toad was because he  had dined with Buster, and how ever since then he had refused even to speak  to his old friends and neighbors. It tickled Buster Bear so to think that  little homely Old Mr. Toad could be proud of anything that he laughed and  laughed, and his laugh was deep and grumbly-rumbly. Then Jimmy told him the  plan to teach Old Mr. Toad a lesson and asked Buster if he would help.  Buster's eyes twinkled as he promised to do what Jimmy asked.    Then Jimmy went straight to where Old Mr. Toad was sitting all puffed up,  taking a sun-bath.    \"Buster Bear has just sent word by me to ask if you will honor him by  dining with him to-morrow at the rotted chestnut stump near the edge of the  Green Forest,\" said Jimmy in his politest manner.    Now if Old Mr. Toad was puffed up before, just think how he swelled out  when he heard that. Jimmy Skunk was actually afraid that he would burst.    \"You may tell my friend, Buster Bear, that I shall be very happy to honor  him by dining with him,\" replied Old Mr. Toad with a very grand air.    Jimmy went off to deliver his reply, and Old Mr. Toad sat and puffed  himself out until he could hardly breathe. \"Honor him by dining with him,\"  said he over and over to himself. \"I never was so flattered in my life.\"          XXII      OLD MR. TOAD LEARNS A LESSON      Pride is like a great big bubble;      You'll find there's nothing in it.    Prick it and for all your trouble      It has vanished in a minute.    Old Mr. Toad was so puffed out with pride as he started for the Green  Forest to dine with Buster Bear that those who saw him wondered if he  wouldn't burst before he got there. Everybody knew where he was going, and  this made Old Mr. Toad feel more important and proud than ever. He might  not have felt quite so puffed up if he had known just how it had come about  that he received this second invitation to dine with Buster Bear. When  Jimmy Skunk brought it to him, Jimmy didn't tell him that Buster had been  asked to send the invitation, and that it was all part of a plan on the  part of some of Old Mr. Toad's old friends and neighbors to teach him a  lesson. No, indeed, Jimmy didn't say anything at all about that!    So Old Mr. Toad went hopping along and stumbling over his own feet, because  his head was held so high and he was so puffed out that he couldn't see  where he was going. He could think of nothing but how important Buster Bear  must consider him to invite him to dinner a second time, and of the  delicious ants he was sure he would have to eat.    \"What very good taste Buster Bear has,\" thought he, \"and how very fortunate  it is that he found out that I also am fond of ants.\"    He was so busy with these pleasant thoughts and of the good dinner that he  expected to have that he took no notice of what was going on about him. He  didn't see his old friends and neighbors peeping out at him and laughing  because he looked so foolish and silly. He was dressed in his very best,  which was nothing at all to be proud of, for you know Old Mr. Toad has no  fine clothes. And being puffed up so, he was homelier than ever, which is  saying a great deal, for at best Mr. Toad is anything but handsome.    He was beginning to get pretty tired by the time he reached the Green  Forest and came in sight of the rotted old chestnut stump where he was to  meet Buster Bear.    Buster was waiting for him. \"How do you do this fine day? You look a little  tired and rather warm, Mr. Toad,\" said he.    \"I am a little warm,\" replied Mr. Toad in his most polite manner, although  he couldn't help panting for breath as he said it. \"I hope you are feeling  as well as you are looking, Mr. Bear.\"    [Illustration: \"I am a little warm,\" replied Mr. Toad in his most polite  manner.]    Buster Bear laughed a great, grumbly-rumbly laugh. \"I always feel fine when  there is a dinner of fat ants ready for me,\" said he. \"It is fine of you to  honor me by coming to dine.\"    Here Mr. Toad put one hand on his stomach and tried to make a very grand  bow. Peter Rabbit, hiding behind a near-by tree, almost giggled aloud, he  looked so funny.    \"I have ventured to invite another to enjoy the dinner with us,\" continued  Buster Bear. Mr. Toad's face fell. You see he was selfish. He wanted to be  the only one to have the honor of dining with Buster Bear. \"He's a little  late,\" went on Buster, \"but I think he will be here soon, and I hope you  will be glad to meet him. Ah, there he comes now!\"    Old Mr. Toad looked in the direction in which Buster Bear was looking. He  gave a little gasp and turned quite pale. All his puffiness disappeared. He  didn't look like the same Toad at all. The newcomer was Mr. Blacksnake.  \"Oh!\" cried Old Mr. Toad, and then, without even asking to be excused, he  turned his back on Buster Bear and started back the way he had come, with  long, frightened hops.    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" shouted Peter Rabbit, jumping out from behind a tree.    \"Ho, ho, ho!\" shouted Jimmy Skunk from behind another.    \"Hee, hee, hee!\" shouted Johnny Chuck from behind a third.    Then Old Mr. Toad knew that his old friends and neighbors had planned this  to teach him a lesson.          XXIII      OLD MR. TOAD IS VERY HUMBLE    When Old Mr. Toad saw Mr. Blacksnake and turned his back on Buster Bear and  the fine dinner to which Buster had invited him, he had but just one idea  in his head, and that was to get out of sight of Mr. Blacksnake as soon as  possible. He forgot to ask Buster Bear to excuse him. He forgot that he was  tired and hot. He forgot all the pride with which he had been so puffed up.

RHYTHMIC CHANGE    There is in nature a universal tendency toward refinement and  compactness of form in space, or contrariwise, toward increment  and diffusion; and this manifests itself in time as acceleration or  retardation. It is governed, in either case, by an exact mathematical  law, like the law of falling bodies. It shows itself in the widening  circles which appear when one drops a stone into still water, in the  convolutions of shells, in the branching of trees and the veining  of leaves; the diminution in the size of the pipes of an organ  illustrates it, and the spacing of the frets of a guitar. More and  more science is coming to recognize, what theosophy affirms, that the  spiral vortex, which so beautifully illustrates this law, both in its  time and its space aspects is the universal archetype, the pattern of  all that is, has been, or will be, since it is the form assumed by the  ultimate physical atom, and the ultimate physical atom is the physical  cosmos in miniature.    This Rhythmic Diminution is everywhere: it is in the eye itself, for  any series of mathematically equal units, such for example as the  columns and intercolumnations of a colonnade, become when seen  in perspective rhythmically unequal, diminishing according to the  universal law. The entasis of a Classic column is determined by this  law, the spirals of the Ionic volute, the annulets of the Parthenon  cap, obey it (Illustration 30).    In recognition of the same principle of Rhythmic Diminution a building  is often made to grow, or appear to grow lighter, more intricate,  finer, from the ground upward, an end attained by various devices,  one of the most common being the employment of the more attenuated  and highly ornamented orders above the simpler and sturdier, as in the  Roman Colosseum, or in the Palazzo Uguccioni, in Florence--to mention  only two examples out of a great number. In the Riccardi Palace  an effect of increasing refinement is obtained by diminishing the  boldness of the rustication of the ashlar in successive stories; in  the Farnese, by the gradual reduction of the size of the angle quoins  (Illustration 30). In an Egyptian pylon it is achieved most simply by  battering the wall; in a Gothic cathedral most elaborately by a  kind of segregation, or breaking up, analogous to that which a tree  undergoes--the strong, relatively unbroken base corresponding to  the trunk, the diminishing buttresses to the tapering limbs, and  the multitude of delicate pinnacles and crockets, to the outermost  branches and twigs, seen against the sky.      RADIATION    The final principle of natural beauty to which the author would call  attention is the law of _Radiation_, which is in a manner a return  to the first, the law of _Unity_. The various parts of any organism  radiate from, or otherwise refer back to common centers, or foci,  and these to centers of their own. The law is represented in its  simplicity in the star-fish, in its complexity in the body of man; a  tree springs from a seed, the solar system centers in the sun.    The idea here expressed by the term \"radiation\" is a familiar one  to all students of theosophy. The Logos radiates his life and light  throughout his universe, bringing into activity a host of entities  which become themselves radial centers; these generate still others,  and so on endlessly. This principle, like every other, patiently  publishes itself to us, unheeding, everywhere in nature, and in  all great art as well; it is a law of optics, for example, that all  straight lines having a common direction if sufficiently prolonged  appear to meet in a point, i.e., radiate from it (Illustration 31).  Leonardo da Vinci employed this principle of perspective in his Last  Supper to draw the spectator's eye to the picture's central figure,  the point of sight toward which the lines of the walls and ceiling  converge centering in the head of Christ. Puvis de Chavannes, in his  Boston Library decoration, leads the eye by a system of triangulation  to the small figure of the Genius of Enlightenment above the central  door (Illustration 32); and Ruskin, in his _Elements of Drawing_, has  shown how artfully Turner arranged some of his compositions to attract  attention to a focal point.    This law of Radiation enters largely into architecture. The Colosseum,  based upon the ellipse, a figure generated from two points or foci,  and the Pantheon, based upon the circle, a figure generated from a  central point, are familiar examples. The distinctive characteristic  of Gothic construction, the concentration or focalization of the  weight of the vaults and arches at certain points, is another  illustration of the same principle applied to architecture,  beautifully exemplified in the semicircular apse of a cathedral, where  the lines of the plan converge to a common center, and the ribs of the  vaulting meet upon the capitals of the piers and columns, seeming  to radiate thence to still other centers in the loftier vaults which  finally meet in a center common to all.    [Illustration 30]    [Illustration 31]    [Illustration 32]    The tracery of the great roses, high up in the facades of the  cathedrals of Paris and of Amiens, illustrate Radiation, in the one  case masculine: straight, angular, direct; in the feminine: curved,  flowing, sinuous. The same _Beautiful Necessity_ determined the  characteristics of much of the ornament of widely separated styles  and periods: the Egyptian lotus, the Greek honeysuckle, the Roman  acanthus, Gothic leaf work--to snatch at random four blossoms from  the sheaf of time. The radial principle still inherent in the debased  ornament of the late Renaissance gives that ornament a unity, a  coherence, and a kind of beauty all its own (Illustration 35).    [Illustration 33]    [Illustration 34]    Such are a few of the more obvious laws of natural beauty and their  application to the art of architecture. The list is by no means  exhausted, but it is not the multiplicity and diversity of these laws  which is important to keep in mind, so much as their relatedness and  cooerdination, for they are but different aspects of the One Law, that  whereby the Logos manifests in time and space. A brief recapitulation  will serve to make this correlation plain, and at the same time fix  what has been written more firmly in the reader's mind.    [Illustration 35]    [Illustration 36]    First comes the law of _Unity_; then, since every unit is in its  essence twofold, there is the law of _Polarity_; but this duality is  not static but dynamic, the two parts acting and reacting upon one  another to produce a third--hence the law of _Trinity_. Given this  third term, and the innumerable combinations made possible by  its relations to and reactions upon the original pair, the law  of _Multiplicity in Unity_ naturally follows, as does the law  of _Consonance_, or repetition, since the primal process of  differentiation tends to repeat itself, and the original combinations  to reappear--but to reappear in changed form, hence the law of  _Diversity in Monotony_. The law of _Balance_ is seen to be but a  modification of the law of Polarity, and since all things are waxing  and waning, there is the law whereby they wax and wane, that of  _Rhythmic Change_. _Radiation_ rediscovers and reaffirms, even in the  utmost complexity, that essential and fundamental unity from which  complexity was wrought.    Everything, beautiful or ugly, obeys and illustrates one or another of  these laws, so universal are they, so inseparably attendant upon every  kind of manifestation in time and space. It is the number of them  which finds illustration within small compass, and the aptness and  completeness of such illustration, which makes for beauty, because  beauty is the fine flower of a sort of sublime ingenuity. A work of  art is nothing if not _artful_: like an acrostic, the more different  ways it can be read--up, down, across, from right to left and from  left to right--the better it is, other things being equal. This  statement, of course, may be construed in such a way as to appear  absurd; what is meant is simply that the more a work of art is  freighted and fraught with meaning beyond meaning, the more secure its  immortality, the more powerful its appeal. For enjoyment, it is not  necessary that all these meanings should be fathomed, it is only  necessary that they should be felt.    Consider for a moment the manner in which Leonardo da Vinci's Last  Supper, an acknowledged masterpiece, conforms to everyone of the laws  of beauty enumerated above (Illustration 32). It illustrates the law  of Unity in that it movingly portrays a single significant episode in  the life of Christ. The eye is led to dwell upon the central personage  of this drama by many artful expedients: the visible part of the  figure of Christ conforms to the lines of an equilateral triangle  placed exactly in the center of the picture; the figure is separated  by a considerable space from the groups of the disciples on either  hand, and stands relieved against the largest parallelogram of light,  and the vanishing point of the perspective is in the head of Christ,  at the apex, therefore, of the triangle. The law of Polarity finds  fulfilment in the complex and flowing lines of the draped figures  contrasted with the simple parallelogram of the cloth-covered table,  and the severe architecture of the room. The law of Trinity is  exemplified in the three windows, and in the subdivision of the twelve  figures of the disciples into four groups of three figures each. The  law of Consonance appears in the repetition of the horizontal lines  of the table in the ceiling above; and in the central triangle before  referred to, continued and echoed, as it were, in the triangular  supports of the table visible underneath the cloth. The law of  Diversity in Monotony is illustrated"]]]
