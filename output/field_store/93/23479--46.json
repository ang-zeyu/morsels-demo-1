Sage is very useful both as a medicine, for the headache--when made  into tea--and for all kinds of stuffing, when dried and rubbed into  powder. It should be kept tight from the air.    Summer-savory is excellent to season soup, broth, and sausages. As a  medicine, it relieves the cholic. Pennyroyal and tansy are good for  the same medicinal purpose.    Green wormwood bruised is excellent for a fresh wound of any kind.  In winter, when wormwood is dry, it is necessary to soften it in warm  vinegar, or spirit, before it is bruised, and applied to the wound.    Hyssop tea is good for sudden colds, and disorders on the lungs. It  is necessary to be very careful about exposure after taking it; it is  peculiarly opening to the pores.    Tea made of colt's-foot and flax-seed, sweetened with honey, is a  cure for inveterate coughs. Consumptions have been prevented by it. It  should be drank when going to bed; though it does good to drink it at  any time. Hoarhound is useful in consumptive complaints.    Motherwort tea is very quieting to the nerves. Students, and people  troubled with wakefulness, find it useful.    Thoroughwort is excellent for dyspepsy, and every disorder occasioned  by indigestion. If the stomach be foul, it operates like a gentle  emetic.    Sweet-balm tea is cooling when one is in a feverish state.    Catnip, particularly the blossoms, made into tea, is good to prevent a  threatened fever. It produces a fine perspiration. It should be taken  in bed, and the patient kept warm.    Housekeepers should always dry leaves of the burdock and horseradish.  Burdocks warmed in vinegar, with the hard, stalky parts cut out, are  very soothing, applied to the feet; they produce a sweet and gentle  perspiration. Horseradish is more powerful. It is excellent in cases  of the ague, placed on the part affected. Warmed in vinegar, and  clapped.    Succory is a very valuable herb. The tea, sweetened with molasses, is  good for the piles. It is a gentle and healthy physic, a preventive  of dyspepsy, humors, inflammation, and all the evils resulting from a  restricted state of the system.    Elder-blow tea has a similar effect. It is cool and soothing, and  peculiarly efficacious either for babes or grown people, when the  digestive powers are out of order.    Lungwort, maiden-hair, hyssop, elecampane and hoarhound steeped  together, is an almost certain cure for a cough. A wine-glass full to  be taken when going to bed.    Few people know how to keep the flavor of sweet-marjoram; the best  of all herbs for broth and stuffing. It should be gathered in bud or  blossom, and dried in a tin-kitchen at a moderate distance from the  fire; when dry, it should be immediately rubbed, sifted, and corked up  in a bottle carefully.    English-mallows steeped in milk is good for the dysentery.           *       *       *       *       *          CHEAP DYE-STUFFS.      A few general rules are necessary to be observed in coloring. The  materials should be perfectly clean; soap should be rinsed out in soft  water; the article should be entirely wetted, or it will spot; light  colors should be steeped in brass, tin, or earthen; and if set at all,  should be set with alum. Dark colors should be boiled in iron, and set  with copperas. Too much copperas rots the thread.    The apothecaries and hatters keep a compound of vitriol and indigo,  commonly called 'blue composition.' An ounce vial full may be bought  for nine-pence. It colors a fine blue. It is an economical plan to  use it for old silk linings, ribbons, &c. The original color should be  boiled out, and the material thoroughly rinsed in soft water, so that  no soap may remain in it; for soap ruins the dye. Twelve or sixteen  drops of the blue composition, poured into a quart bowl full of warm  soft water, stirred, (and strained, if any settlings are perceptible,)  will color a great many articles. If you wish a deep blue, pour in  more of the compound. Cotton must not be colored; the vitriol destroys  it; if the material you wish to color has cotton threads in it, it  will be ruined. After the things are thoroughly dried, they should be  washed in cool suds, and dried again; this prevents any bad effects  from the vitriol; if shut up from the air without being washed, there  is danger of the texture being destroyed. If you wish to color green,  have your cloth free as possible from the old color, clean, and  rinsed, and, in the first place, color it a deep yellow. Fustic  boiled in soft water makes the strongest and brightest yellow dye;  but saffron, barberry bush, peach leaves, or onion skins, will answer  pretty well. Next take a bowl full of strong yellow dye, and pour in a  great spoonful or more of the blue composition. Stir it up well with a  clean stick, and dip the articles you have already colored yellow into  it, and they will take a lively grass green. This is a good plan for  old bombazet curtains, dessert cloths, old flannel for covering a  desk, &c; it is likewise a handsome color for ribbons.    Balm blossoms, steeped in water, color a pretty rose-color. This  answers very well for the linings of children's bonnets, for ribbons,  &c. It fades in the course of one season; but it is very little  trouble to recolor with it. It merely requires to be steeped and  strained. Perhaps a small piece of alum might serve to set the color,  in some degree. In earthen or tin.    Saffron, steeped in earthen and strained, colors a fine straw color.  It makes a delicate or deep shade according to the strength of the  tea. The dry outside skins of onions, steeped in scalding water and  strained, color a yellow very much like 'bird of paradise' color.  Peach leaves, or bark scraped from the barberry bush, colors a common  bright yellow. In all these cases, a little piece of alum does no  harm, and may help to fix the color. Ribbons, gauze handkerchiefs, &c.  are colored well in this way, especially if they be stiffened by a bit  of gum-Arabic, dropped in while the stuff is steeping.    The purple paper, which comes on loaf sugar, boiled in cider, or  vinegar, with a small bit of alum, makes a fine purple slate color.  Done in iron.    White maple bark makes a good light-brown slate color. This should  be boiled in water, set with alum. The color is reckoned better when  boiled in brass, instead of iron.    The purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colors for  stockings; and it is an economical plan, after they have been mended  and cut down, so that they will no longer look decent, to color old  stockings, and make them up for children.    A pailful of lye, with a piece of copperas half as big as a hen's egg  boiled in it, will color a fine nankin color, which will never wash  out. This is very useful for the linings of bed-quilts, comforters,  &c. Old faded gowns, colored in this way, may be made into good  petticoats. Cheap cotton cloth may be colored to advantage for  petticoats, and pelisses for little girls.    A very beautiful nankin color may likewise be obtained from  birch-bark, set with alum. The bark should be covered with water,  and boiled thoroughly in brass or tin. A bit of alum half as big as  a hen's egg is sufficient. If copperas be used instead of alum, slate  color will be produced.    Tea-grounds boiled in iron, and set with copperas, make a very good  slate color.    Log-wood and cider, in iron, set with copperas, makes a good black.  Rusty nails, or any rusty iron, boiled in vinegar, with a small bit of  copperas, makes a good black,--black ink-powder done in the same way  answers the same purpose.           *       *       *       *       *          MEAT CORNED, OR SALTED, HAMS, &C.      When you merely want to corn meat, you have nothing to do but to rub  in salt plentifully, and let it set in the cellar a day or two. If you  have provided more meat than you can use while it is good, it is well  to corn it in season to save it. In summer, it will not keep well more  than a day and a half; if you are compelled to keep it longer, be sure  and rub in more salt, and keep it carefully covered from cellar-flies.  In winter, there is no difficulty in keeping a piece of corned beef  a fortnight or more. Some people corn meat by throwing it into their  beef barrel for a few days; but this method does not make it so sweet.  A little salt-petre rubbed in before you apply the common salt, makes  the meat tender; but in summer it is not well to use it, because it  prevents the other salt from impregnating; and the meat does not keep  as well.    If you wish to salt fat pork, scald coarse salt in water and skim it,  till the salt will no longer melt in the water. Pack your pork down  in tight layers; salt every layer; when the brine is cool, cover the  pork with it, and keep a heavy stone on the top to keep the pork under  brine. Look to it once in a while, for the first few weeks, and if the  salt has all melted, throw in more. This brine, scalded and skimmed  every time it is used, will continue good twenty years. The rind of  the pork should be packed towards the edge of the barrel.    It is good economy to salt your own beef as well as pork. Six pounds  of coarse salt, eight ounces of brown sugar, a pint of molasses, and  eight ounces of salt-petre, are enough to boil in four gallons of  water. Skim it clean while boiling. Put it to the beef cold; have  enough to cover it; and be careful your beef never floats on the top.  If it does not smell perfectly sweet, throw in more salt; if a scum  rises upon it, scald and skim it again, and pour it on the beef when  cold.    Legs of mutton are very good, cured in the same way as ham. Six pounds  of salt, eight ounces of salt-petre, and five pints of molasses, will  make pickle enough for one hundred weight. Small legs should be kept  in pickle twelve or fifteen days; if large, four or five weeks are not  too much. They should be hung up a day or two to dry, before they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#8)"],[1,"rrow, but the Mouse was gone in a flash. He fitted a  blunt arrow to the string, then waited, and when the Mouse returned he  shot the arrow. It missed the Mouse, struck the log and bounded back  into Yan's face, giving him a stinging blow on the cheek. And as Yan  rolled around grunting and rubbing his cheek, he thought, \"This is  what I tried to do to the Woodmouse.\" Thenceforth, Yan made no attempt  to harm the Mouse; indeed, he was willing to share his meals with it.  In time they became well acquainted, and Yan found that not one, but a  whole family, were sharing with him his shanty in the woods.    Biddy's remark about the Indian tobacco bore fruit. Yan was not a  smoker, but now he felt he must learn. He gathered a lot of this  tobacco, put it to dry, and set about making a pipe--a real Indian  peace pipe. He had no red sandstone to make it of, but a soft red  brick did very well. He first roughed out the general shape with his  knife, and was trying to bore the bowl out with the same tool, when  he remembered that in one of the school-readers was an account of the  Indian method of drilling into stone with a bow-drill and wet sand.  One of his schoolmates, the son of a woodworker, had seen his father  use a bow-drill. This knowledge gave him new importance in Yan's eyes.  Under his guidance a bow-drill was made, and used much and on many  things till it was understood, and now it did real Indian service by  drilling the bowl and stem holes of the pipe.    He made a stem of an Elderberry shoot, punching out the pith at home  with a long knitting-needle. Some white pigeon wing feathers trimmed  small, and each tipped with a bit of pitch, were strung on a stout  thread and fastened to the stem for a finishing touch; and he would  sit by his camp fire solemnly smoking--a few draws only, for he did  not like it--then say, \"Ugh, heap hungry,\" knock the ashes out, and  proceed with whatever work he had on hand.    Thus he spent the bright Saturdays, hiding his accouterments each  day in his shanty, washing the paint from his face in the brook, and  replacing the hated paper collar that the pride and poverty of his  family made a daily necessity, before returning home. He was a little  dreamer, but oh! what happy dreams. Whatever childish sorrow he found  at home he knew he could always come out here and forget and be happy  as a king--be a real King in a Kingdom wholly after his heart, and all  his very own.          XII    A Crisis      At school he was a model boy except in one respect--he had strange,  uncertain outbreaks of disrespect for his teachers. One day he amused  himself by covering the blackboard with ridiculous caricatures of the  principal, whose favourite he undoubtedly was. They were rather clever  and proportionately galling. The principal set about an elaborate plan  to discover who had done them. He assembled the whole school and began  cross-examining one wretched dunce, thinking him the culprit. The lad  denied it in a confused and guilty way; the principal was convinced of  his guilt, and reached for his rawhide, while the condemned set up a  howl. To the surprise of the assembly, Yan now spoke up, and in a tone  of weary impatience said:    \"Oh, let him alone. I did it.\"    His manner and the circumstances were such that every one laughed. The  principal was nettled to fury. He forgot his manhood; he seized Yan  by the collar. He was considered a timid boy; his face was white; his  lips set. The principal beat him with the rawhide till the school  cried \"Shame,\" but he got no cry from Yan.    That night, on undressing for bed, his brother Rad saw the long black  wales from head to foot, and an explanation was necessary. He was  incapable of lying; his parents learned of his wickedness, and new and  harsh punishments were added. Next day was Saturday. He cut his usual  double or Saturday's share of wood for the house, and, bruised and  smarting, set out for the one happy spot he knew. The shadow lifted  from his spirit as he drew near. He was already forming a plan for  adding a fireplace and chimney to his house. He followed the secret  path he had made with aim to magnify its secrets. He crossed the open  glade, was, nearly at the shanty, when he heard voices--loud, coarse  voices--_coming from his shanty_. He crawled up close. The door  was open. There in his dear cabin were three tramps playing cards and  drinking out of a bottle. On the ground beside them were his shell  necklaces broken up to furnish poker chips. In a smouldering fire  outside were the remains of his bow and arrows.    Poor Yan! His determination to be like an Indian under torture  had sustained him in the teacher's cruel beating and in his home  punishments, but this was too much. He fled to a far and quiet corner  and there flung himself down and sobbed in grief and rage--he would  have killed them if he could. After an hour or two he came trembling  back to see the tramps finish their game and their liquor; then they  defiled the shanty and left it in ruins.    The brightest thing in his life was gone--a King discrowned,  dethroned. Feeling now every wale on his back and legs, he sullenly  went home.    This was late in the summer. Autumn followed last, with shortening  days and chilly winds. Yan had no chance to see his glen, even had he  greatly wished it. He became more studious; books were his pleasure  now. He worked harder than ever, winning honour at school, but  attracting no notice at the home, where piety reigned.    The teachers and some of the boys remarked that Yan was getting very  thin and pale. Never very robust, he now looked like an invalid; but  at home no note was taken of the change. His mother's thoughts were  all concentrated on his scapegrace younger brother. For two years she  had rarely spoken to Yan peaceably. There was a hungry place in  his heart as he left the house unnoticed each morning and saw his  graceless brother kissed and darlinged. At school their positions  were reversed. Yan was the principal's pride. He had drawn no more  caricatures, and the teacher flattered himself that that beating was  what had saved the pale-faced head boy.    He grew thinner and heart-hungrier till near Christmas, when the  breakdown came.           *       *       *       *       *    \"He is far gone in consumption,\" said the physician. \"He cannot live  over a month or two\"    [Illustration: \"There in his dear cabin were three tramps\"]    \"He _must_ live,\" sobbed the conscience-stricken mother. \"He must  live--O God, he must live.\"    All that suddenly awakened mother's love could do was done. The  skilful physician did his best, but it was the mother that saved him.  She watched over him night and day; she studied his wishes and comfort  in every way. She prayed by his bedside, and often asked God to  forgive her for her long neglect. It was Yan's first taste of  mother-love. Why she had ignored him so long was unknown. She was  simply erratic, but now she awoke to his brilliant gifts, his steady,  earnest life, already purposeful.          XIII    The Lynx      As winter waned, Yan's strength returned. He was wise enough to use  his new ascendency to get books. The public librarian, a man of broad  culture who had fought his own fight, became interested in him, and  helped him to many works that otherwise he would have missed.    \"Wilson's Ornithology\" and \"Schoolcraft's Indians\" were the most  important. And they were sparkling streams in the thirst-parched land.    In March he was fast recovering. He could now take long walks; and one  bright day of snow he set off with his brother's Dog. His steps bent  hillward. The air was bright and bracing, he stepped with unexpected  vigour, and he made for far Glenyan, without at first meaning to go  there. But, drawn by the ancient attraction, he kept on. The secret  path looked not so secret, now the leaves were off; but the Glen  looked dearly familiar as he reached the wider stretch.    His eye fell on a large, peculiar track quite fresh in the snow. It  was five inches across, big enough for a Bear track, but there were no  signs of claws or toe pads. The steps were short and the tracks had  not sunken as they would for an animal as heavy as a Bear.    As one end of each showed the indications of toes, he could see what  way it went, and followed up the Glen. The dog sniffed at it uneasily,  but showed no disposition to go ahead. Yan tramped up past the ruins  of his shanty, now painfully visible since the leaves had fallen, and  his heart ached at the sight. The trail led up the valley, and crossed  the brook on a log, and Yan became convinced that he was on the track  of a large Lynx. Though a splendid barker, Grip, the dog, was known to  be a coward, and now he slunk behind the boy, sniffing at the great  track and absolutely refusing to go ahead.    Yan was fascinated by the long rows of footprints, and when he came  to a place where the creature had leaped ten or twelve feet without  visible cause, he felt satisfied that he had found a Lynx, and the  love of adventure prompted him to go on, although he had not even a  stick in his hand or a knife in his pocket. He picked up the best club  he could find--a dry branch two feet long and two inches through, and  followed. The dog was now unwilling to go at all; he hung back, and  had to be called at each hundred yards.    They were at last in the dense Hemlock woods at the upper end of the  valley, when a peculiar sound like the call of a deep-voiced cat was  heard.    _Yow! Yow! Yowl!_    Yan stood still. The dog, although a large and powerful retriever,  whimpered, trembled and crawled up close.    The sound increased in volume. The yowling _meouw_ came louder,  louder and nearer, then suddenly clear and close, as though the  creature had rounded a point and entered an opening. It was positively  blood-curdling now. The dog could stand it no more; he turned and went  as fast as he could for "]]]
