At any rate, we saw that we could in nowise keep the old maid any  longer; I therefore called her out of the kitchen, and told her she had  better go early next morning to Liepe, as there still was food there,  whereas here she must starve, seeing that perhaps we ourselves might leave  the parish and the country to-morrow. I thanked her for the love and faith  she had shown us, and begged her at last, amid the loud sobs of my poor  daughter, to depart forthwith privately, and not to make our hearts still  heavier by leave-taking; that old Paasch was going a-fishing to-night on  the Achterwater, as he had told me, and no doubt would readily set her on  shore at Gruessow, where she had friends, and could eat her fill even  to-day. She could not say a word for weeping, but when she saw that I was  really in earnest she went out of the room. Not long after we heard the  house-door shut to, whereupon my daughter moaned, \"She is gone already,\"  and ran straight to the window to look after her. \"Yes,\" cried she, as she  saw her through the little panes, \"she is really gone\"; and she wrung her  hands and would not be comforted. At last, however, she was quieted when I  spoke of the maid Hagar, whom Abraham had likewise cast off, but on whom  the Lord had nevertheless shown mercy in the wilderness; and hereupon we  commended ourselves to the Lord, and stretched ourselves on our couches of  moss.          _The Ninth Chapter_      HOW THE OLD MAID-SERVANT HUMBLED ME BY HER FAITH, AND THE LORD YET BLESSED  ME HIS UNWORTHY SERVANT    \"Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy  name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who  forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who  redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving  kindness and tender mercies\" (Psalm ciii.).    Alas! wretched man that I am, how shall I understand all the benefits and  mercies which the Lord bestowed upon me the very next day? I now wept for  joy, as of late I had done for sorrow; and my child danced about the room  like a young roe, and would not go to bed, but only cry and dance, and  between-whiles repeat the 103rd Psalm, then dance and cry again until  morning broke. But as she was still very weak, I rebuked her presumption,  seeing that this was tempting the Lord; and now mark what had happened.    After we had both woke in the morning with deep sighs, and called upon the  Lord to manifest to us in our hearts what we should do, we still could not  make up our minds. I therefore called to my child, if she felt strong  enough, to leave her bed and light a fire in the stove herself, as our  maid was gone; that we would then consider the matter further. She  accordingly got up, but came back in an instant with cries of joy, because  the maid had privately stolen back into the house, and had already made  a fire. Hereupon I sent for her to my bedside, and wondered at her  disobedience, and asked what she now wanted here but to torment me and  my daughter still more, and why she did not go yesterday with old Paasch?  But she lamented and wept so sore that she scarce could speak, and I  understood only thus much--that she had eaten with us, and would likewise  starve with us, for that she could never part from her young mistress,  whom she had known from her cradle. Such faithful love moved me so, that I  said almost with tears, \"But hast thou not heard that my daughter and I  have determined to wander as beggars about the country; where, then, wilt  thou remain?\" To this she answered that neither would she stay behind,  seeing it was more fitting for her to beg than for us; but that she could  not yet see why I wished to go out into the wide world; whether I had  already forgotten that I had said in my induction sermon that I would  abide with my flock in affliction and in death? That I should stay yet  a little longer where I was, and send her to Liepe, as she hoped to get  something worth having for us there from her friends and others. These  words, especially those about my induction sermon, fell heavy on my  conscience, and I was ashamed of my want of faith, since not my daughter  only, but yet more even my maid, had stronger faith than I, who  nevertheless professed to be a servant of God's word. I believed that the  Lord--to keep me, poor fearful hireling, and at the same time to humble  me--had awakened the spirit of this poor maid-servant to prove me, as the  maid in the palace of the high-priest had also proved the fearful St.  Peter. Wherefore I turned my face towards the wall, like Hezekiah, and  humbled myself before the Lord, which scarce had I done before my child  ran into the room again, with a cry of joy; for behold, some Christian  heart had stolen quietly into the house in the night, and had laid in the  chamber two loaves, a good piece of meat, a bag of oatmeal, _item_, a bag  of salt, holding near a pint. Any one may guess what shouts of joy we all  raised. Neither was I ashamed to confess my sins before my maid; and in  our common morning prayer, which we said on our knees, I made fresh vows  to the Lord of obedience and faith. Thus we had that morning a grand  breakfast, and sent something to old Paasch besides; _item_, my daughter  again sent for all the little children to come, and kindly fed them with  our store before they said their tasks; and when in my heart of little  faith I sighed thereat, although I said nought, she smiled, and said,  \"Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take  thought for the things of itself.\"    The Holy Ghost spoke by her, as I cannot but believe, nor thou either,  beloved reader: for mark what happened. In the afternoon she (I mean my  child) went up the Streckelberg to seek for blackberries, as old Paasch  had told her, through the maid, that a few bushes were still left. The  maid was chopping wood in the yard, to which end she had borrowed old  Paasch his axe, for the Imperialist thieves had thrown away mine, so that  it could nowhere be found; and I myself was pacing up and down in the  room, meditating my sermon; when my child, with her apron full, came  quickly in at the door, quite red and with beaming eyes, and scarce able  for joy to say more than \"Father, father, what have I got?\" \"Well,\" quoth  I, \"what hast thou got, my child?\" Whereupon she opened her apron, and I  scarce trusted my eyes when I saw, instead of the blackberries which she  had gone to seek, two shining pieces of amber, each nearly as big as a  man's head, not to mention the small pieces, some of which were as large  as my hand, and that, God knows, is no small one. \"Child of my heart,\"  cried I, \"how camest thou by this blessing from God?\" As soon as she could  fetch her breath, she told me as follows:--    That while she was seeking for blackberries in a dell near the shore she  saw somewhat glistening in the sun, and on coming near she found this  wondrous godsend, seeing that the wind had blown the sand away from off a  black vein of amber. That she straightway had broken off these pieces with  a stick, and that there was plenty more to be got, seeing that it rattled  about under the stick when she thrust it into the sand, neither could she  force it farther than, at most, a foot deep into the ground; _item,_ she  told me that she had covered the place all over again with sand, and swept  it smooth with her apron, so as to leave no traces.    Moreover, that no stranger was at all likely to go thither, seeing that no  blackberries grew very near, and she had gone to the spot, moved by  curiosity and a wish to look upon the sea, rather than from any need; but  that she could easily find the place again herself, inasmuch as she had  marked it with three little stones. What was our first act after the  all-merciful God had rescued us out of such misery, nay, even, as it  seemed, endowed us with great riches, any one may guess. When we at length  got up off our knees, my child would straightway have run to tell the maid  our joyful news. But I forbade her, seeing that we could not be sure that  the maid might not tell it again to her friends, albeit in all other  things she was a faithful woman and feared God; but that if she did that,  the Sheriff would be sure to hear of it, and to seize upon our treasure  for his princely highness the Duke--that is to say, for himself; and that  nought would be left to us but the sight thereof, and our want would begin  all over again; that we therefore would say, when folks asked about the  luck that had befallen us, that my deceased brother, who was a councillor  at Rotterdam, had left us a good lump of money; and, indeed, it was true  that I had inherited near two hundred florins from him a year ago, which,  however, the soldiery (as mentioned above) cruelly robbed me of; _item,_  that I would go to Wolgast myself next day and sell the little bits as  best I might, saying that thou hadst picked them up by the seaside; thou  mayest tell the maid the same, if thou wilt, but show the larger pieces to  no one, and I will send them to thy uncle at Hamburg to be turned into  money for us; perchance I may be able to sell one of them at Wolgast, if I  find occasion, so as to buy clothes enough for the winter for thee and for  me, wherefore thou, too, mayst go with me. We will take the few farthings  which the congregation have brought together to pay the ferry, and thou  canst order the maid to wait for us till eventide at the water-side to  carry home the victuals.

Not when you were there, for I was installed here  just before your good father's death.\"    \"I left there two years since,\" Wulf said, \"in order to be one of  Earl Harold's pages; but I have not forgotten my reading, for the  earl insists that his pages give two hours a day to study.\"    \"Tis a good rule,\" the prior said, \"for learning is like a weapon,  it soon becomes rusted when thrown aside. You will, I hope, continue  the habit.\"    \"I should wish to do so, father, but there are no manuscripts here.\"    \"In that at least I can supply your wants,\" the prior said. \"My  monastery has a good library, and it will be quite at your service,  and also my advice in any matters that may concern you. My almoner  here, brother John, knows pretty well the circumstances of most of  your people, and may be able to tell you where your alms may be  well bestowed, and where they would do more harm than good. The  worthless are ever the most importunate, and for every honest man  in need there are twenty rogues abegging.\"    The ice once broken, the prior came over frequently. His conversation  was bright and interesting. He himself was engaged in writing a  history of the Saxon and Danish monarchs from the times of Alfred,  and had stores of anecdotes of people and events of whom Wulf had  before heard only vague traditions from the wandering singers and  story-tellers who travelled the country, and were welcome guests  in every household. As Wulf was urged by the prior to come over  whenever time hung on his hands, his visits to the monastery were  naturally very much more frequent than those of the prior to Steyning.  Sometimes he would sit in the private apartment of the prior, but  more often he spent his time studying the rare manuscripts, or  watching the monks at their work of copying and illuminating. If  he went in the evening he generally sat in the refectory, where the  monks for the most part spent their evening in talk and harmless  amusement, for the strict rules and discipline that prevailed in  monastic establishments on the Continent had been unknown up to  that time in England, although some of the Norman bishops were doing  their best to introduce them into the establishments in their  dioceses,--a proceeding that caused great discontent, and was  strongly opposed by the English monks. These had, hitherto, regarded  monastic life as one of work for the good of the poor, and as  affording for those who wished it a tranquil retirement from the  trials of the world. Moreover, it offered special attractions to  those of quiet and studious tastes, since the monasteries provided  the architects and the painters, the teachers and the writers, and  it was here alone that learning was maintained and fostered.  Consequently, at Bramber there was none of that monastic asceticism  that prevailed abroad, and later became the rule in England also.    During the day the monks had their pursuits according to their  tastes. There were those who worked in the copying and painting  room. There were some who drew plans for churches or the dwellings  of the wealthy, and who sometimes went out and superintended the  carrying out of their designs. Some were in charge of the garden,  where the work was chiefly done by the lay servitors, and where the  herbs and simples were grown that were used in the concoction of  the medicines distributed among the sick, and highly prized throughout  the country round. Two or three were skilled in music, and these  taught and conducted the choir, while two acted as teachers to  youths, the sons of thanes and others, who, moved by the ardour  with which their earl advocated learning, intrusted their sons to  the monks for education. Then when the day's work was done, and  vespers sung in the chapel, the monks gathered in the refectory.  The conversation was of a bright and varied description, and as  Wulf moved about from group to group he listened to the talk with  far greater pleasure than he had ever derived from that at court,  and largely increased his knowledge in many respects.    National matters were discussed with keen interest, for the monks  were all English, and viewed with bitter hostility the elevation  of foreigners to the chief dignities of the church, not only because  they were foreigners, but because they introduced innovations of  all kinds, and sought to reduce the Church of England to subjection  to Rome, whereas previously it had been wholly independent of Papal  authority. In secular matters, too, there were dangers that threatened  the tranquillity of the country. Chief among these were the turbulence  and ambition of Tostig, and the menace to the kingdom by his extensive  earldom of Northumbria with its alien Danish population, which was  rendered more serious by his alliance with the kings of Norway.    Then, too, it was doubtful whether the great central earldom of  Mercia could be relied upon to act cordially with the West Saxons;  Griffith of Wales was still restless and turbulent; and lastly,  there was the ever-present menace of the Norman duke. Had England  been united it could have laughed at the pretensions of the Duke  of Normandy; but with Northumbria ready at any moment to break into  civil war, and with Mercia doubtful, the claim of Normandy, however  shadowy and indefensible, could not but be considered as a grave  element of danger.    Listening to the talk of the monks Wulf learned much more as to the  actual situation than he had done in the court of the Normanized  king, and his feelings of patriotism became more and more developed  and strengthened, while he applied himself with even greater ardour  to his military exercises, as he recognized more fully the necessity  that might arise for every West Saxon to be ready to take his place  in the line of battle. The evenings that he spent at home were by  no means dull. It was only in considerable towns that there were  inns for the accommodation of travellers. Everywhere else these  were dependent upon hospitality, and no door was ever closed in  their faces. It was seldom that less than five or six travellers  rested for the night at Steyning, and often that number was largely  exceeded. Besides the wayfarers there were the professional wanderers,  the minstrels, the story-tellers, and occasionally a troupe of  buffoons.    All these were welcome, for they brought the news from without; the  last rumours in London concerning the quarrels of the earls; the  movements of the Danish ships that were harrying the coast, and  those of the vessels Earl Harold despatched to cope with them; the  prices of wool and hides in the chief markets; and even reports of  what was happening beyond the seas. Leaving the dais, Wulf would  go down and listen to the talk of the travellers, or, when they  were of a degree above the common, have them up beside him, and  question them as to their journeyings, the places they had visited,  and the personages they had seen. Thus his hours were fully occupied  from morning until night. He found far less time than he had expected  for sport, and although he occasionally went out with his falcons  or hunted the stag in the forest, which covered a wide extent of  country beyond the hills, it was but seldom that he could find  leisure for these amusements.    \"It seems to me that you are always doing something, Wulf,\" Osgod  said one day. \"It is not at all the sort of life I should have  thought a young thane would live. Why, you work many more hours a  day than I did in my father's forge. It is either books, or the  affairs of the tenants, or visiting the monastery all day when you  are not at work with your sword exercises. When I have done with  my work with Leof I like to lie down in the sun and take it quietly,  and I cannot understand how you can be for ever on foot.\"    \"I have so many things to do, Osgod; there is so much to learn, and  I do not wish to grow up a mere beer swiller like Edmund of Angmering  or Ethelred of Arundel. Their lives are, as far as I can see, no  whit higher or more worthy than that of their own serfs, from whom  they differ only that they eat more, drink more, and sleep on softer  beds. Earl Harold expects better things than that of me, and I want  to make myself worthy of being one of those in whom he can place  confidence and on whom he can depend in case of trouble. I have  heard him say how bad it is for England that our thanes are, in  learning and culture, so far behind the nobles of other countries,  and that if England is ever to take her place among great nations  it must be by her thanes first raising themselves to the level of  the nobles abroad, who are the counsellors of their kings. I can  never hope to be anything like Earl Harold, who is the wisest and  greatest of Englishmen, but I do hope so to fit myself that some  day he may think me worthy of trust and confidence.\"    \"Well, master,\" Osgod said lazily, \"every one to his liking. I  hope to be a good soldier and your true servant, but as for all  this thinking and learning it would weary me to death.\"          CHAPTER III.      AT COURT.    Two months after Wulf had gone down to Steyning one of Harold's men  brought a short letter from the earl himself. \"I am glad to hear,  Wulf,\" it began, \"from my steward, Egbert, that you are applying  yourself so heartily to your work. I have also good accounts of you  from the Prior of Bramber, who sometimes writes to me. He is a good  and wise man, as well as a learned one, and I am right glad to hear  that you are spending your time so well. I told you that you should  hear if there was any alteration in your affair. Some change was  made as soon as you had left; for, two days later, meeting William  of London in the"]]]
