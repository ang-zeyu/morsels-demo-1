A stronger or weaker may bring calamity and death. The  parental instinct, with the instinct of reproduction, is fundamental to  life. It is the basis of tenderness and sympathy, and is likewise the  foundation of jealousy and often of hatred and pugnacity. At one time it  may mean the deepest and most abiding pleasures of life, and at another  it may bring death. Life cannot exist without it, and yet, that it may  persist, Nature seriously overloads many machines with disastrous  results. History is replete with the helplessness of reason and judgment  in dealing with these emotions. Neither when they act for good nor for  ill can reason and judgment have the slightest weight when these  instincts and emotions are stirred to the depths.    The emotion to acquire and keep property is very strong and perhaps at  the base of the deep desire for wealth. This emotion is probably of a  comparatively late growth, but today it seems to have taken its place as  one of the strongest that move men. This emotion, like all others,  prompts man to get what he wants. It of course does not suggest the way,  but is simply an urge to acquire and possess. It is modified and hedged  about by customs and habits but, like all instincts, its strength is  always seeking ways to accomplish results regardless of the rules laid  down and thus urging their violation. With weak machines and imperfect  systems, where not only are the restrictions imperfect, the habits not  well defined, but where it is impossible to satisfy the instinct under  the rules laid down, there can be but one result; a large number will  take property wherever and however they can get it.    The instinct for acquisition is so strong that men are constantly  contriving new and improved methods for getting property. Often the new  methods come under restraint of the law. The enactment of the law does  not give man the feeling that a thing is wrong which before was right  and many continue their ways of getting property, regardless of the law.  The instinct is too strong, the needs too great, and the barriers too  weak.    Instincts are primal to man. He has inherited them from the animal  world. Their strength and weakness depend on the make-up of the machine.  Some are very strong and some abnormally weak, and there are no two  machines that emphasize or repress the same instincts to the same  degree. One need but look at his family and neighbors to see the various  manifestations of these instincts. Some are quarrelsome and combative  and will fight on the slightest provocation. Others are distinctively  social; the gregarious instinct is pronounced in many people. These are  always seen in company and cannot be alone. They readily adapt  themselves to any sort of associations. Others are solitary. They choose  to be alone. They shrink from and avoid the society of others. In some  the instinct at the basis of sex association is over-strong; they like  children; they are generally sympathetic and emotional, and the strength  of the instinct often leads them to excesses. Others are entirely  lacking in this instinct; they neither care for children nor want them;  they habitually avoid association with the other sex. The difference is  constituent in the elements that make up the machine.    Everyone is familiar with the varying strength and weakness of the  instincts of getting and hoarding as shown by his neighbors and  acquaintances. Some seem to have no ambition or thought for getting or  keeping money. Some can get it but cannot keep it. Some have in them  from childhood the instinct for getting the better of every trade; for  hoarding what they get, and accumulating property all their lives. In  this, as in all other respects, no two individuals are alike. History is  filled with examples of men who had the instinctive power of getting  money combined with the instinct for keeping it. Their names are  familiar, all the way from Midas and Croesus down to the prominent  captains of industry today. It is common for them and their adherents  who criticise new schemes of social organization to remark with the  greatest assurance that before wealth can be equal, brains must be  equal. The truth is that brains have little to do with either the making  or accumulating of money. This depends mainly, like all other  activities, on the strength or weakness of the instincts involved. One's  brain capacity cannot be measured by his bank account, any more than by  the strength of his body or the color of his hair. His bank account  simply shows his innate tendencies. There is no doubt that brain  capacity as well as physical perfection adds to power, but it is the  instinct that determines the tendency and strength of the activity.    To say that the one who gets money the most easily and keeps it the most  safely has the best brain is no more reasonable than to say that the  foxhound is more intelligent than the bull-dog because it can run  faster. Nature formed one for running and the other for holding on. The  brain power is not involved.    There are manifold ways of gratifying all these instincts. The desire  for property calls simply for getting it and keeping it. It does not  involve the method to be used. The way is determined by other faculties,  by education, by opportunities, by the strength and weakness of  inhibitions. It does not follow that all legal ways are morally right  and all illegal ones morally wrong. Society in its development has  established certain ways in which it may be done. These ways are easy  for some, they are hard for others, and for many quite impossible.    Still the instinct for getting is always present, leading and urging to  acquire and to keep. Endless are the ways that men have contrived to  gratify this instinct. If, perchance, a law stands in the way, means are  always sought to get around the law. Every desire is always seeking its  own gratification or satisfaction. This means life. Most men believe  that the way they adopt for getting money or gratifying other instincts  is really no worse than some other person's way. The man who uses the  confidence game contends with great assurance that his methods are like  other business methods; that all men are using every means to get the  largest return for the least effort, and one way is no better than  another. A considerable portion of society has always supported him in  these ideas. The law is full of shadowy lines which divide legal  acquisition from the illegal, some of which are so fine that no one can  see more than a technical difference. For instance, under an indictment  for obtaining money by false pretenses, one may make all sorts of  statements as to the quality, value, style and desirability of the  article sold, if he does not make a specific statement of a fact  regarding the material contained in them or the amount, number, quality  or the like. He may lie, but to be safe he must know the kind of lie the  law permits. Many lies pass as \"puffing goods\" and are within the pale.  A trader is not expected to tell the truth. What he can and cannot say  may be determined only by a careful examination of the law, and not  always then.    Infinite are the reasons men give for doing the things that their  instincts bid them do. All depends upon the strength of the instinct and  the character of the machine; the restrictions and habits formed; and  many other factors of which the man knows nothing. In fact, all depends  upon his endowment and the outside forces that move to action, and for  none of these is he in any way to be praised or blamed.    Society seems to be almost oblivious to the emotional life of man. The  great masses of men have no capacity or chance to prepare a proper  environment in the intense commercialism and mad rush of today. The laws  of trade and commerce give most men food, clothing and shelter but  nothing more. There is no beauty in their homes or surroundings; no  music or art; no adventure or speculation. Existence is a dead thing, a  dreary round. To many such people crime furnishes the only chance for  adventure. Take away emotions and life is hopelessly dull and  commonplace. The emotions of men must be fed just as the body must be  fed. To many religion has furnished this emotional life. Churches have  provided some art and some music. But aside from the Catholic Church  almost none of this is for the poor. To many if not most people religion  cannot take the place of joy. Dogma and creed deaden and cannot appeal  to the reason of man. Still they have furnished a large part of the  emotional life to great masses of men, without which existence would  hold no hope or joy. But this is not enough to fill most lives. The  element of joy is largely lacking. To many it makes no appeal, although  music and art and beauty do. In no country has society so utterly  neglected and ignored the emotional side of man as in America. This has  led many men to a life of adventure that for them has been possible only  in crime. Many others found this life in the saloon, mixed with  influences not conducive to a normal life. The closing of the saloons  has added to the already serious need of providing for the innate  feelings of men. This is all the more important for America, as a large  part of our population has come from lands where beauty and art and  music have for generations been made a part of the common life of all.          VII    THE CRIMINAL      Those who have had no experience in the courts and no knowledge of what  is known as the \"criminal class\" have a general idea that a criminal is  not like other men. The people they know are law-abiding, conventional  believers in the State and the Church and all social customs and  relations; they have strict ideas of property rights, and regard the law  as sacred.

Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by the _Sairindhri_, the wicked  Kichaka losing control over his senses and overcome by lust, although  aware of the numerous evils of fornication, evils condemned by everybody  and sometimes leading to the destruction of life itself,--then spoke  unto Draupadi, 'It behoveth thee not, O beauteous lady, O thou of  graceful features, thus to disregard me who am, O thou of sweet smiles,  under the power of Manmatha on thy account. If now, O timid one, thou  disregardest me who am under thy influence and who speak to thee so  fair, thou wilt, O black-eyed damsel, have to repent for it afterwards.  O thou of graceful eye-brows, the real lord of this entire kingdom, O  slender-waisted lady, is myself. It is me depending upon whom the people  of this realm live. In energy and prowess I am unrivalled on earth.  There is no other man on earth who rivals me in beauty of person, in  youth, in prosperity, and in the possession of excellent objects of  enjoyment. Why it is, O auspicious lady, that having it in thy power to  enjoy here every object of desire and every luxury and comfort without  its equal, thou preferest servitude. Becoming the mistress of this  kingdom which I shall confer on thee, O thou of fair face, accept me,  and enjoy, O beauteous one, all excellent objects of desire.' Addressed  in these accursed words by Kichaka, that chaste daughter of Drupada  answered him thus reprovingly, 'Do not, O son of a _Suta_, act so  foolishly and do not throw away thy life. Know that I am protected by my  five husbands. Thou canst not have me. I have Gandharvas for my  husbands. Enraged they will slay thee. Therefore, do thou not bring  destruction on thyself. Thou intendest to tread along a path that is  incapable of being trod by men. Thou, O wicked one, art even like a  foolish child that standing on one shore of the ocean intends to cross  over to the other. Even if thou enterest into the interior of the earth,  or soarest into the sky, or rushest to the other shore of the ocean,  still thou wilt have no escape from the hands of those sky-ranging  offspring of gods, capable of grinding all foes. Why dost thou today, O  Kichaka, solicit me so persistently even as a sick person wisheth for  the night that will put a stop to his existence? Why dost thou desire  me, even like an infant lying on its mother's lap wishing to catch the  moon? For thee that thus solicitest their beloved wife, there is no  refuge either on earth or in sky. O Kichaka, hast thou no sense which  leads thee to seek thy good and by which thy life may be saved?'\"      SECTION XV    Vaisampayana said, \"Rejected thus by the princess, Kichaka, afflicted  with maddening lust and forgetting all sense of propriety, addressed  Sudeshna saying, 'Do thou, Kekaya's daughter, so act that thy  _Sairindhri_ may come into my arms. Do thou, O Sudeshna, adopt the means  by which the damsel of the gait of an elephant may accept me; I am dying  of absorbing desire.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing his profuse lamentations, that gentle  lady, the intelligent queen of Virata, was touched with pity. And having  taken counsel with her own self and reflected on Kichaka's purpose and  on the anxiety of Krishna, Sudeshna addressed the _Suta's_ son in these  words, 'Do thou, on the occasion of some festival, procure viands and  wines for me. I shall then send my _Sairindhri_ to thee on the pretence  of bringing wine. And when she will repair thither do thou in solitude,  free from interruption, humour her as thou likest. Thus soothed, she may  incline her mind to thee.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, he went out of his sister's  apartments. And he soon procured wines well-filtered and worthy of a  king. And employing skilled cooks, he prepared many and various kinds of  choice viands and delicious drinks and many and various kinds of meat of  different degrees of excellence. And when all this had been done, that  gentle lady Sudeshna, as previously counselled by Kichaka, desired her  _Sairindhri_ to repair to Kichaka's abode, saying, 'Get up, O  _Sairindhri_ and repair to Kichaka's abode to bring wine, for, O  beauteous lady, I am afflicted with thirst.' Thereupon the _Sairindhri_  replied, 'O princess, I shall not be able to repair to Kichaka's  apartments. Thou thyself knowest, O queen, how shameless he is. O thou  of faultless limbs, O beauteous lady, in thy palace I shall not be able  to lead a lustful life, becoming faithless to my husbands. Thou  rememberest, O gentle lady, O beautiful one, the conditions I had set  down before entering thy house. O thou of tresses ending in graceful  curls, the foolish Kichaka afflicted by the god of desire, will, on  seeing me, offer me insult. Therefore, I will not go to his quarters.  Thou hast, O princess, many maids under thee. Do thou, good betide thee,  send one of them. For, surely, Kichaka will insult me.' Sudeshna said,  'Sent by me, from my abode, surely he will not harm thee.' And having  said this, she handed over a golden vessel furnished with a cover. And  filled with apprehension, and weeping, Draupadi mentally prayed for the  protection of the gods, and set out for Kichaka's abode for fetching  wine. And she said, 'As I do not know another person save my husbands,  by virtue of that Truth let Kichaka not be able to overpower me although  I may approach his presence.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And that helpless damsel then adored Surya for  a moment. And Surya, having considered all that she urged, commanded a  _Rakshasa_ to protect her invisibly. And from that time the _Rakshasa_  began to attend upon that blameless lady under any circumstances. And  beholding Krishna in his presence like a frightened doe, the _Suta_ rose  up from his seat, and felt the joy that is felt by a person wishing to  cross to the other shore, when he obtains a boat.\"      SECTION XVI    \"Kichaka said, 'O thou of tresses ending in beautiful curls, thou art  welcome. Surely, the night that is gone hath brought me an auspicious  day, for I have got thee today as the mistress of my house. Do what is  agreeable to me. Let golden chains, and conchs and bright ear-rings made  of gold, manufactured in various countries, and beautiful rubies and  gems, and silken robes and deer-skins, be brought for thee. I have also  an excellent bed prepared for thee. Come, sitting upon it do thou drink  with me the wine prepared from the honey flower.' Hearing these words,  Draupadi said, 'I have been sent to thee by the princess for taking away  wine. Do thou speedily bring me wine, for she told me that she is  exceedingly thirsty.' At this, Kichaka said, 'O gentle lady, others will  carry what the princess wants.' And saying this, the _Suta's_ son caught  hold of Draupadi's right arm. And at this, Draupadi exclaimed, 'As I  have never, from intoxication of the senses, been unfaithful to my  husbands even at heart, by that Truth, O wretch, I shall behold thee  dragged and lying powerless on the ground.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Seeing that large-eyed lady reproving him in  that strain, Kichaka suddenly seized her by the end of her upper garment  as she attempted to run away. And seized with violence by Kichaka, the  beautiful princess, unable to tolerate it, and with frame trembling with  wrath, and breathing quickly, dashed him to the ground. And dashed to  the ground thus, the sinful wretch tumbled down like a tree whose roots  had been cut. And having thrown Kichaka down on the ground when the  latter had seized her, she, trembling all over rushed to the court,  where king Yudhishthira was, for protection. And while she was running  with all her speed, Kichaka (who followed her), seizing her by the hair,  and bringing her down on the ground, kicked her in the very presence of  the king. Thereupon, O Bharata, the _Rakshasa_ that had been appointed  by Surya to protect Draupadi, gave Kichaka a shove with a force mighty  as that of the wind. And overpowered by the force of _Rakshasa_, Kichaka  reeled and fell down senseless on the ground, even like an uprooted  tree. And both Yudhishthira and Bhimasena who were seated there, beheld  with wrathful eyes that outrage on Krishna by Kichaka. And desirous of  compassing the destruction of the wicked Kichaka, the illustrious Bhima  gnashed his teeth in rage. And his forehead was covered with sweat, and  terrible wrinkles appeared thereon. And a smoky exhalation shot forth  from his eyes, and his eye-lashes stood on end. And that slayer of  hostile heroes pressed his forehead with his hands. And impelled by  rage, he was on the point of starting up with speed. Thereat king  Yudhishthira, apprehensive of discovery, squeezed his thumbs and  commanded Bhima to forbear. And Bhima who then looked like an infuriate  elephant eyeing a large tree, was thus forbidden by his elder brother.  And the latter said, 'Lookest thou, O cook, for trees for fuel. If thou  art in need of faggots, then go out and fell trees.' And the weeping  Draupadi of fair hips, approaching the entrance of the court, and seeing  her melancholy lords, desirous yet of keeping up the disguise duty-bound  by their pledge, with eyes burning in fire, spoke these words unto the  king of the Matsyas, 'Alas, the son of a _Suta_ hath kicked today the  proud and beloved wife of those whose foe can never sleep in peace even  if four kingdoms intervene between him and them. Alas, the son of a  _Suta_ hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those truthful  personages, who are devoted to Brahmanas and who always give away  without asking any thing in gift. Alas! the son of a _Suta_ hath kicked  today the proud and beloved wife of those, the sounds of whose  kettle-drums and the twangs of whose bow-strings are ceaselessly"]]]
