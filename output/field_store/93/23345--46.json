Paetus, however, stood in  terror of his archery, which took effect in the very camp itself, as well  as of the cavalry, which kept appearing at all points. Hence he made peace  proposals to his antagonist, accepted his terms, and took an oath that he  would himself abandon all of Armenia and that Nero should give it to  Tiridates. The Parthian was satisfied enough with this agreement, seeing  that he was to obtain control of the country without a contest and would  be making the Romans his debtors for a very considerable kindness. And, as  he learned that Corbulo (whom Paetus several times sent for before he was  surrounded) was drawing near, he dismissed the beleaguered soldiers,  having first made them agree to build a bridge over the river Arsanias for  him. He was not really in need of a bridge, for he had crossed on foot,  but he wished to give them a practical example of the fact that he was  stronger than they. Indeed, he did not retire by way of the bridge even on  this occasion, but rode across on an elephant, while the rest got over as  before.    [Sidenote:--22--] The capitulation had scarcely been made when Corbulo  with inconceivable swiftness reached the Euphrates and there waited for  the retreating force. When the two armies approached each other you would  have been struck with the difference between them and between their  generals: one set were fairly aglow with delight at their rapidity; the  others were grieved and ashamed of their compact. Vologaesus sent Monaeses  to Corbulo with the demand that the newcomer should give up the fort in  Mesopotamia. So they held a prolonged conference together right at the  bridge crossing the Euphrates, after first destroying the center of the  structure. Corbulo having promised to leave the country if the Parthian  would also abandon Armenia, both of these things were done temporarily  until Nero could learn the outcome of the engagements and begin  negotiations with the envoys of Vologaesus, whom the latter had sent a  second time. The answer given them by the emperor was that he would bestow  Armenia upon Tiridates if this aspirant would come to Rome. Paetus was  deposed from his command and the soldiers that had been with him were sent  somewhere else. Corbulo was again assigned to the war against the same  foes. Nero had intended to accompany the expedition in person, but after  falling down during the ceremony of sacrificing he would not venture to go  abroad but remained where he was.]    [Sidenote:--23--] [Corbulo therefore officially prepared for war upon  Vologaesus and sent a centurion bidding him depart from the country.  Privately, however, he suggested to the king that he send his brother to  Rome, and this advice met with acceptance, since Corbulo seemed to have  the stronger force. Thus it came about that they both, Corbulo and  Tiridates, met at no other place than Rhandea, which suited them both. It  appealed to the Parthian because there his people had cut off the Romans  and had sent them away under a capitulation, a visible proof of the favor  that had been done them. To the Roman it appealed because his men were  going to wipe out the ill repute that had attached to them there before.  For the meeting of the two was not limited merely to conversation; a lofty  platform had been erected on which were set images of Nero, and in the  presence of crowds of Armenians, Parthians, and Romans Tiridates  approached and did them reverence; after sacrificing to them and calling  them by laudatory names he took off the diadem from his head and set it  upon them. Monobazus and Vologaesus also came to Corbulo and gave him  hostages. In honor of this event Nero was a number of times saluted as  imperator and held a triumph, contrary to precedent.] But Corbulo in spite  of the large force that he had and the very considerable reputation that  he enjoyed did not rebel and was never accused of rebellion. He might  easily have been made emperor, since men thoroughly detested Nero but all  admired him in every way. [In addition to the more striking features of  his submissive behavior he voluntarily sent to Rome his son-in-law Annius,  who served as his lieutenant; this was done professedly that Annius might  escort Tiridates back, but in fact this relative stood in the position of  a hostage to Nero. The latter was so firmly persuaded that his general  would not revolt that Corbulo obtained his son-in-law as lieutenant  [Footnote: Reading [Greek: hyparchon] (Boissevain) for [Greek: hypaton].]  before he had been praetor.]    [Sidenote: A.D. 65 (a.u. 818)] [Sidenote:--24--] Seneca, however, and  Rufus the prefect and some other prominent men formed a plot against Nero.  They could no longer endure his ignoble behavior, his licentiousness, and  his cruelty. They desired at one and the same time to be rid of these  evils and to give Nero his release from them. Indeed, Sulpicius Asper, a  centurion, and Subrius Flavius, a military tribune, both belonging to the  body-guards, admitted this to him point blank. Asper, when interrogated by  the emperor as to the reason for his attempt, replied: \"I could help you  in no other way.\" And the response of Flavins was: \"I both loved you and  hated you above all men. I loved you, hoping that you would prove a good  emperor: I have hated you because you do so-and-so. I can not be slave to  charioteer or lyre-player.\"--Information was lodged and these men were  punished, besides many others indirectly associated with them. Everything  in the nature of a complaint that could be entertained against any one for  excessive joy or grief, for words or gestures, was brought forward and was  believed. Not one of these complaints, even if fictitious, could be  refused credence in view of Nero's actual deeds. Hence conscienceless  friends and house servants of some men flourished greatly. Persons guarded  against strangers and foes,--for of these they were suspicious,--but were  bound to expose themselves whether they would or no to their associates.    [Sidenote:--25--] It would be no small task to record details about most  of those that perished, but the fate of Seneca needs a few words by  itself. It was his wish to end the life of his wife Paulina at the same  time with his own, for he declared that he had taught her to despise death  and that she desired to leave the world in company with him. So he opened  her veins as well as his own. As he failed, however, to yield readily to  death, his end was hastened by the soldiers; and his dying so speedily  enabled Paulina to survive. He did not lay hands upon himself, however,  until he had revised the book which he had composed and had deposited with  various persons certain other valued possessions which he feared might  come into Nero's hands and be destroyed. Thus was Seneca forced to part  with life in spite of the fact that he had on the pretext of illness  abandoned the society of the emperor and had bestowed upon him his entire  property, supposedly to help defray the expense of necessary building  operations. His brothers, too, perished after him.    [Sidenote:--26--] Likewise Thrasea and Soranus, who had no superiors in  family, wealth, and every excellence, met their death not because they  were accused of conspiracy but because they were what they were. Against  Soranus Publius Egnatius Celer, a philosopher, gave false evidence. The  victim had had two associates,--Cassius Asclepiodotus of Nicaea and this  Publius of Berytus. Now Asclepiodotus so far from speaking against Soranus  bore witness to his noble qualities; he was at the time exiled for his  pains, but later, under Galba, was restored. Publius in return for his  services as blackmailer received money and honors (as did others of the  same profession), but subsequently he was banished. Soranus was slain on  the charge of having caused his daughter to employ a species of magic, the  foundation for this story being that when he was sick his family had  offered some sacrifices. Thrasea was executed for not appearing regularly  at the senate-house, thus showing that he did not like the measures  passed, for not listening to the emperor's singing and zither-playing, for  not sacrificing to Nero's Divine Voice as did the rest, and for not giving  any public exhibitions: for it was remarked that at Patavium, his native  place, he had acted in a tragedy given in pursuance of some old custom at  a festival held every thirty years. As he made the incision in his artery,  he raised his hand, exclaiming: \"To thee, Jupiter, patron of freedom, I  pour this libation of blood.\"      [Sidenote:--27--] [And Junius Torquatus, a descendant of Augustus, made  himself liable to a most strange indictment. He had squandered his  property in a rather lavish way, whether following his native bent or with  the intention of not being very rich. Nero therefore declared that, as he  lacked many things, he must be covetous of the goods of others, and  consequently caused a fictitious charge to be brought against him of  aspiring to imperial power.]    And why should one be surprised that such complaints  were fastened upon them, [Footnote: A slight gap in the MS. exists here,  filled by a doubtful conjecture of Boissevain's.] seeing that one man  [Footnote: _Salvidienus Orfitus_ (according to Suetonius, Life of  Nero, chap. 37).] was brought to trial and slain for living near the  Forum, for letting out some shops, or for receiving a few friends in them;  and another [Footnote: _C. Cassius Longinus_ (ibid)..] because he  possessed a likeness of Cassius, the murderer of Caesar?    The conduct of a woman named Epicharis also deserves mention.

Misticoosis, who had spent all the hours in  arraying herself in her finery and adornment, boldly thrust herself to the  front, and crowded out the modest Omemee, who was flushed by the busy work  of cooking the dinner, and was wisely dressed in a costume which harmonized  with her face and with the work in which she had been engaged so  industriously.    \"The instant the handsome young Indian landed--fancy the amazement of the  two girls to notice that he had on his feet the same beautiful moccasins  that, not many hours before, Omemee had given to the aged feeble man!  Before anyone could utter a word he came striding up to the girls, and  said:    \"'As an old, weary man, I came to your wigwam a few hours ago. Misticoosis  gave me nothing but abuse, yet my only crime was that I was old. Her tongue  went on and on without stopping, and all of her words were words of abuse  for the old man and anger that he should have been left to live so long.  But Omemee, kind-hearted Omemee, pitied the poor old man. She made him sit  down on a couch of deerskins, that he might rest his tired limbs. She  built a fire and warmed him. She took of the best of the venison, and made  him food and drink, and then ere he left she put on his feet the most  beautiful of her moccasins. All her gifts to the unknown old man were the  best she had.    \"'See the beautiful moccasins, the gift of Omemee!    \"'I was that old man--I am now the lover long seeking a bride. I have made  my choice. Two beautiful maidens for a time divided my heart. There is no  division now. By testing them I have found out that only one is lovely  within.    \"'That no man may have to put up through life with the unceasing clatter of  the tongue of Misticoosis, she will be from this time the unbeautiful aspen  tree, while her tongue shall be the leaves that will never again be still  even in the gentlest breeze. The leaves of other trees shall rest at times,  but the aspen leaves, now the tongue of Misticoosis, shall ever be restless  and unquiet.'    \"And even while he was speaking, Misticoosis, who was amazed and ashamed at  the words he spoke, became rooted to the ground, and gradually turned into  an aspen tree.    \"Then, turning from her to the maiden of his choice, he exclaimed:    \"'But Omemee, the loving, the tender, the kind-hearted, thou art my heart's  choice!'    \"Saying this, the handsome hunter opened his arms, and Omemee sprang toward  him. For a moment he held her in his arms; then he said:    \"'I am Wakontas, and to the beautiful home of Wakontas thou shalt be  taken.'    \"Then there was a wonderful transformation; as quickly as a butterfly  bursts from its chrysalis, so suddenly was Omemee transformed into a  beautiful dove and the hunter as quickly assumed the same lovely form.  Together they arose into the air, and flew away to the unknown but  beautiful home of Wakontas, in the land of perpetual sunshine.\"          CHAPTER V.      The Startling Placard--What Happened to the Little  Runaways--The Rescue--Mary Tells Them the Legend of the  Swallows--How Some Cruel Men were Punished who Teased  an Orphan Boy.    When Mary entered the children's bedroom one bright, pleasant morning she  was amazed at finding both of the beds empty and a piece of foolscap paper  pinned to the dressing table. The writing on it was beyond her power to  read. She remembered now that the children had begged her not to come very  early in the morning to wake them up, and as their requests were as a law  she had lingered as long as she dared, and indeed had only gone to call  them when her mistress had asked the reason for their nonappearance. Not  until she had shown the paper, with its inscription, to the kitchen maid,  who could read English, did its full meaning burst upon her. Of course, she  was very much troubled, and yet such was her loyalty to the children that  she hesitated about letting the parents know what had occurred. She was  fully aware that she could not long keep the startling news from them, and  yet she was still resolved that never should any information be imparted by  her that might bring down upon them any punishment, no matter how much  deserved.    It was a long, rough trail through the primitive forest to the wigwam of  Souwanas. How long the children had been away she could not tell. Mary,  with Indian shrewdness, had felt their beds, and had found them both quite  cold, so she knew the little mischiefs had been off at least an hour. She  interrogated not only the maid in the kitchen but also Kennedy, the man of  all work, outside. Neither of them had seen or heard anything of the  children, and as they did not share Mary's ideas the escapade of the  children was soon known.    The parents were naturally alarmed when they heard the news. At once the  father, accompanied by Kennedy and the dogs, Jack and Cuffy, started off on  the trail of the runaways. The intelligent dogs, having been shown a couple  of garments recently worn by the missing boy and girl and being told to  find them, at once took up the trail in the direction of the wigwam of  Souwanas, running with such rapidity that if they had not been restrained  by the voice of their master they would very quickly have left him and his  Indian attendant far behind.    At length, with a sudden start, both dogs, growling ominously, dashed off  ahead, utterly regardless of all efforts made by their master to restrain  them. This suspicious conduct on the part of the dogs of course alarmed the  father and his Indian companion, and as rapidly as the rough trail would  allow they hurried on in the direction taken by the dogs. Soon their ears  were greeted by a chorus of loud and angry yelping. Fear gave speed to both  the men, and soon they dashed out from the forest into the opening of an  Indian's clearing. Here was a sight that filled them with alarm, and almost  terror. Standing on a pile of logs were little Sagastao and Minnehaha.  Sagastao erect and fearless, with a club about as large as an ordinary  cane, while behind him, leaning against a high fallen log, was Minnehaha.  Surrounding them were several fierce, wolfish Indian dogs, among whom Jack  and Cuffy, wild and furious, were now making dire havoc. One after another,  wounded and limping, the curs skulked away as the two men rushed up to the  children.    \"Ha! ha! hurrah for our Jack and Cuffy; aren't they the boss dogs!\" shouted  the fearless little runaways, and now that the victory was won they nimbly  sprang down from their high retreat and, apparently without the slightest  fear, congratulated both their father and the Indian on the superiority of  their own dogs.    Trembling with anxiety, the anxious father, thankful at the narrow escape  of his children, as he clasped them in his arms could not but be amazed at  the indifference of the little ones to the great danger from which they had  just escaped. After petting Jack and Cuffy for their great bravery and  courage the return journey was begun, much to the regret of the children,  who pleaded hard to be allowed to resume their trip to the wigwam of  Souwanas to hear the stories of Nanahboozhoo.    [Illustration: \"Surrounding them were several fierce, wolfish Indian  dogs.\"]    The father was perfectly amazed at this request, and of course it was  sternly refused. He had started off in pursuit of the runaways with a  resolve to punish them for this serious breach of home discipline, but his  alarm at their danger and his thankfulness for their escape had so stirred  him that he could not punish them nor even chide them at the time. All he  could do was to bring them safely home again and, as usual in such  emergencies, turn them over to the tender mercies of their mother.    Sturdily the children marched on ahead for a while, then Kennedy, the  Indian, took Minnehaha in his arms. He had not carried her many hundred  yards before the weary little one fell fast asleep, softly muttering as she  slipped off into the land of dreams, \"Wanted to hear about Nanahboozhoo.\"    Great was the excitement at home when the party returned. Sagastao rushed  into the arms of his mother, and without the slightest idea of having done  anything wrong began most dramatically to describe how \"our Jack and Cuffy  thrashed those naughty Eskimo dogs\" that chased Minnehaha and him upon that  great pile of logs. Mary in the meantime had taken from Kennedy's arms the  still sleeping Minnehaha, and almost smothered her with kisses as she bore  her away to bed.    There was great perplexity on the part of the parents to know just what to  do to impress upon the little ones that they had been very naughty in thus  running away, for it was very evident from the utterances of both that they  had not considered the matter in that light. Now, in view of the weariness  of Minnehaha, it was decided to leave the matter of discipline in abeyance  until a little of the excitement had passed away.    In the meantime Sagastao was ready to talk with everybody about the whole  affair. It seems that he and Minnehaha had decided that Mary was \"no good\"  in telling stories. He said her stories neither frightened them nor made  them cry, but Souwanas was the boss man to tell Nanahboozhoo stories. He  said they got up before anybody was stirring, that morning, and dressed  themselves so quietly that nobody heard them. They remembered the trail  along which Souwanas and Jakoos had carried them. After they had walked for  some time they came to where there was a larger trail, and they turned into  it, and came upon a lot of dogs that had been chasing some rabbits. Soon  the rabbits got away from the dogs, when they reached those trees that had  been chopped down. Minnehaha was the first to notice that the dogs had  turned back, and were coming after them, and she shouted:    \"'O, look! those dogs think we are rabbits, and they are coming for us!'\"    \"When I saw they really were coming,\" said"]]]
