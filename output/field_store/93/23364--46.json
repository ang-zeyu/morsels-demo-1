Of the  mock villas that have been \"put up\" in this quarter, we must speak with  forbearance. Their little bits of Gothic plastered here and there; their  puny machicolations, square and pointed arches, and stained glass \"cut out  into little stars\"--are but sorry specimens of taste, and but poor  indications of comfort. They seem to totter like card-houses, and all their  spick-and-span finery vanishes beside a wing of the picturesque--a cottage  in true rustic taste, with rudely-arched virandahs, formed of limbs and  trunks of trees, intermixed with evergreens, and reminding us of the  \"gnarled oaks and soft myrtles\" of the poet's fancy; and with trimmed  arches of thatch over little casements, with flowers      \"Blinding the lower panes.\"    Now is the little hatch-gate slammed with the wind, contrasting its rude  sound with the rusty creak of the \"invisible\" iron fence just set up, but  already      So loose that it but wants another push    To leap from off its hinges;    --the milk-white window-sill, or painted flower-pots ranged on bars of  cast-iron, like so many toys of Nature. Such was the contrast when we last  visited the \"Grove;\" the picturesque cottage was then as we have described  it, and its new-born neighbours were rising fast on every side, and we  would not insure its existence for a week longer; for the slicing, cutting,  and carving of this once beautiful spot, exceeds all credibility. With all  these changes, however, the fine panoramic view of two hundred miles may  still be enjoyed from this spot, and overlooking the meaner glories of the  GREAT CITY at your feet, the eye rests on the \"sister hills,\" Harrow spire,  and where      Majestic Windsor lifts his princely brow;    Shooter's Hill and Greenwich, with tower, dome, and turret; Sydenham and  Norwood on the south; and Chelsea and the _unbridged_ winding Thames on the  west. Art has not yet thrown up her screens, so as to fence in this world  of beauties from our enjoyment. Here we sit down and rest our recreant  limbs, leaving the reader to enjoy the innumerable reflections which our  poor mention has called up. Another fine day, and we may proceed in our  stroll.    PHILO.

A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.      SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *      EPIGRAM.    _The Division of Justice._        John Hobbs, partridge-snaring, was dragged to the 'Squire,    The Magistrate flamed, but the statute hung fire.    \"Burns states,\" says the Clerk, \"that tread-mill will do,    For two months, if the culprit's convicted by two.\"    \"Two months and two magistrates: I sit alone.    Well, Clerk, we must _halve_ it--commit him for _one_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      HUDSON AND HIS PIGS.      The following is extracted from a recent American (private) letter:--    Hudson, who is a general dealer, purchased a cottage, to which pertained  amongst other _furniture_ a sty. As this was of course uninhabited, his  first care was to supply it with inmates, and, having purchased a couple of  fine pigs, he set off homewards with his bargains comfortably lodged in his  cart. Upon arriving at Buenos Ayres, a part of the harness broke, down went  the cart, and out shot Hudson and his bristly companions backwards; but  unfortunately falling upon one of the poor animals, he crushed him to  death. This was bad, Hudson looked blank, as who does not upon perceiving  Dame Fortune playing him foul? and woeful was it indeed to witness death  amongst his live stock; in this dilemma however, his wits did not utterly  forsake him, and concluding that if he could make the animal bleed, it  would probably be marketable and not prove a _dead_ loss, he proceeded to  act on this prudent supposition, and immediately cut its throat; which  sanguinary act so alarmed the companion pig, that taking to his heels, he  instantly made off (like his swinish brethren of old) towards the sea. Poor  Hudson, between the dead and the living pig, was dreadfully distressed,  being apprehensive of losing both; however being fortunate enough to engage  a man to pursue the absconded delinquent, he proceeded home with the  defunct, and by dint of ablutions, and scrapings, &c. really made of it \"a  very pretty pig.\" This done, it was hung up in the dairy or beer-cellar, I  know not which, ready for market, and if Hudson plumed himself upon  cheating fortune at least in one instance, he was not to blame; but, lo! in  the morning, poor pig, presented a hideous and horrible spectacle, and poor  Hudson stood aghast to behold it! The cats had made during the night so  plentiful a repast upon his new purchase, so that instead of a handsome  corpse there remained only a mangled assemblage of bloody bones, and  fragments of flesh! Poor Hudson! but after all, these misfortunes were  mainly attributable to his own carelessness, and as to whether he ever  recovered his truant pig, I cannot say; perhaps the man may be in pursuit  of him still.    S.L.           *       *       *       *       *      ON A PERSON SAYING HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON MUSIC.        On music that you spend your time,      You surely can't mean what you say,    For all who know you must allow      You keep time whilst you sing or play.           *       *       *       *       *      OLD PARR.      Thomas Parr lived to the extraordinary age of 152 years. He was of the  county of Salop, born anno 1483. He lived in the reigns of ten princes,  viz. Edward IV., King Edward V., King Richard III., King Henry VII., King  Henry VIII., King Edward VI., Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, King James, and  King Charles, was buried at Westminster Abbey, November 15, 1635.

Colonel Despreaux, in a late pamphlet on the Police of Paris, remarks, that  there seem to be different periods for different crimes. He had always  observed the summer months to be comparatively months of low riot. November  began the burglaries, January and February the stealing of  pocket-handkerchiefs and snuff-boxes, probably from the conflux to the  theatres at that time. But, that swindling transactions, and all other  frauds that require peculiar dexterity, were prevalent about _March_.           *       *       *       *       *      LONDON LEVELS.      The most lofty site in the immediate vicinity of London is the tavern  called Jack Straw's Castle, on the brow of Hampstead Heath, which is 443  feet above the Thames. The top of the cross of St. Paul's Cathedral is 407  feet, whilst its base, or ground-line, is 52 feet. The base of the lowest  building is that of the Bricklayer's Arms, Kent Road, the sill of the south  door of which is only six inches above the high-water mark. The sill of the  north entrance-door of Westminster Hall is only 11 inches.           *       *       *       *       *      Lately published, with a Frontispiece, and thirty other Engravings, price  5s.

The word \"Avver\" has doubtless the same origin as the German word  _\"Hafer\" \"Haber\"_ which signifies in English, _oat_.    In some parts of Germany a pap of oatmeal \"Haferbrei\" is very common  as breakfast of the lower classes. Of \"Haferbrod\" oatbread, I only  heard in 1816, when the other sorts of grain were so very scarce in  Germany.    _A German and Constant Reader of the Mirror_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE HALCYON    (_For the Mirror_.)      So often alluded to by the poets, is the bird called the King Fisher.  It was believed by the ancients that while the female brooded over the  eggs, the sea and weather remained calm and unruffled; hence arose the  expression of Halcyon days.

Woolsthorp, Lincolnshire, a little village on the great north road  between Stamford and Grantham, is memorable as the birthplace of that  illustrious philosopher, Sir Isaac Newton. The house in which he was  born, is a kind of farmhouse, built of stone, and is, or was lately  standing. The learned Dr. Stukely visited it in 1721, and was showed  the inside of it by the country people; in a letter to Dr. Mead on  this occasion, he says, \"They led me up stairs, and showed me Sir  Isaac's study, where I suppose he studied when in the country, in his  younger days, as perhaps, when he visited his mother from the  university. I observed the shelves were of his own making, being  pieces of deal boxes, which probably he sent his books and clothes  down in upon these occasions.\"    Halbert H.           *       *       *       *       *          The Gatherer.    \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"    SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *        When Dr. Johnson courted Mrs. Porter, whom he afterwards married, he  told her \"that he was of mean extraction, that he had no money; and  that he had an uncle hanged!\" The lady by way of reducing herself, to  an equality with the doctor, replied, \"that she had no more money than  himself; and that, though she had not a relation hanged, she had  _fifty who deserved hanging_.\" And thus was accomplished this very  curious amour.

The tax-man, confounded,  apologized in the best manner he could, stating his regret that he did  not recollect it. \"I dare say,\" said my lord, \"you are very sorry you  did not _re_-collect it.\"           *       *       *       *       *      IN KENSINGTON CHURCHYARD.      \"Here are deposited the remains of Mrs. Ann Floyer, the beloved wife  of Mr. Richard Floyer, of Thistle Grove, in this parish, died on  Thursday the 8th of May, 1823.    \"_God hath chosen her as a pattern for the other Angels_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      IN DUNDEE CHURCHYARD.        \"Here lies the body of John Watson,    Read not this with your hats on,    For why?
