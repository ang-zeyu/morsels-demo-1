But camphor being volatile,  would, by its evaporation, cause the powder to constantly change in  character. Castor oil has been found to be a better diluent, as this  will not evaporate.    As all of the smokeless powders made of a low grade gun-cotton were  found to deteriorate and spoil, experiments were made with gun-cotton of  the highest degree of nitration, both alone and in combination with  nitro-glycerine. These experiments were first conducted in England by  private parties and by the British government, when it was found that  high grade gun-cotton would give excellent results if made into a  colloidal solid and used alone, or in combination with certain other  constituents. With a view to saving the large quantity of solvents  necessary to reduce the gun-cotton, and to get a more prompt and certain  ignition with a larger grain, experiments were cautiously made by the  admixture of varying proportions of nitro-glycerine to the gun-cotton  when dissolved, or rather along with other solvents in the process of  dissolving it.    It was soon found that nitro-glycerine added in quantities, even equal  in weight to the gun-cotton itself, did not materially increase the  rapidity of the explosion of the compound. And it was also found that  high grade gun-cotton, when combined with nitro-glycerine, gave very  much better results than low grade gun-cotton.    I have spoken here of high and low grade gun-cotton, when in fact the  word gun-cotton should be applied only to the highest nitro-compound of  cellulose. The word gun cotton has always been rather loosely used.  Pyroxyline would be a better word, as this applies to all grades. When  cotton fiber is soaked in a large excess of a mixture of the strongest  nitric and sulphuric acids, gun-cotton proper, or that of the highest  grade, is produced. When weaker acids are used, lower grades of  nitro-cellulose are formed.    The first mentioned or highest grade gun-cotton, when thoroughly freed  from its acids, has always proved to be a perfectly stable compound. The  lower grades have always been found to be unstable and subject to  spontaneous decomposition. Nitro-glycerine has also been erroneously  thought to be a very unstable compound. But experiments have proved  that, when made pure, it is perfectly stable.    Having now explained how the knowledge came to be arrived at that the  aforementioned compound of highest grade nitro-glycerine and highest  grade gun-cotton would constitute the best basis for a smokeless powder,  I will now mention a few of the other conditions necessary to success  with its use, without assuming that smokeless powder has yet passed its  experimental stage, and is beyond further improvement. Nevertheless,  such is the compound which has come to stay as the basis of all  smokeless powders; and any smokeless powder, if a successful one, may be  counted upon as being made of this compound of gun-cotton and  nitro-glycerine, or of a colloid of gun-cotton, either alone or combined  with diluents, oxygen-bearing salts, or inert matter. The fact that  smokeless powder may still be said to be in somewhat of an experimental  stage is not to admit that it is not a success. Firearms, cartridge  cases, and projectiles are also still in an experimental stage, for they  are constantly being improved; yet their use has been a great success  for a good many years.    The question of success of a smokeless powder does not rest alone with  the powder itself. The gun, the cartridge case, primer, and bullet have  been as much the subjects of experiments in adapting them to the use of  smokeless powder as has the smokeless powder in being adapted to them.  To impart a velocity of 2,000 feet per second to a rifle ball, with  corresponding long range and accuracy of flight, has been a question as  much of improvement in rifles and projectiles as in the powder. To give  a velocity of 2,000 feet per second to a bullet, requires a pressure of  at least 15 English tons in the chamber of a gun. This would be a  dangerous pressure in an old-fashioned shoulder arm; while a bullet made  only of lead would strip on striking the rifling and pass right through  the barrel of the gun without taking any rotary motion whatever. It  might at first seem that the powder is the only thing to be considered;  but high ballistics can only be obtained when everything else is adapted  to its use.    The projectile, the cartridge case, the fulminating cap, and the gun  have had to be all built up together, and a very large amount of  experimenting has been necessary to determine what would constitute the  best projectile, best cartridge case, best fulminating cap, and what  should be the character of the rifling and the quality and temper of the  steel of the gun barrel.    It has been necessary first to conduct experiments to test the smokeless  powders for velocities and pressures, and then with the powders test  various kinds of projectiles and guns. In order to obtain the high  ballistics which have been secured, it has been found necessary to cover  the bullet with something harder than lead and to rifle the gun in a  special manner.    The French, who were the first to definitely adopt smokeless powder,  were the first also to make a rifle, projectile, cartridge case and  primer suited to its use.    To obtain long range with a small long bullet such as is now used, it  should rotate at a very high speed. It is well known to artillerists  that a projectile of four or more calibers in length has to be rotated  at a much higher speed than one of half that length, in order to keep  the projectile stiff in the air, and to prevent it from ending over in  its flight. To communicate this very high rotary movement to the bullet  in the instant of time during which it is passing through the barrel,  the rifling of the gun has to exert an enormous torsion on the bullet.  Lead, no matter how hardened, is not sufficiently strong, as it will not  only strip and pass straight through the gun without taking any rotary  movement whatever, but under such very high pressures it behaves like  wax, and is thrown from the gun in a distorted mass.    The French cover their bullets with German silver, a substance made of  nickel, zinc and copper; and in order to put as little strain upon the  rifling and projectile as possible, the rifling of the gun is made with  an increasing twist, and has no sharp edges. The French rifle is made  very strong at the breech and is of tempered steel throughout. In this  way the French have made smokeless powder a success--a smokeless powder  made substantially of a character such as I have herein described. With  smokeless powder, the French rifle imparts a muzzle velocity of 2,000  feet per second to the bullet, with a range of about 2,400 meters.    If smokeless powder be divided into sufficiently small grains to be  ignited by an ordinary fulminating cap, it would burn too quickly,  thereby causing the pressure to mount too high, and without giving the  desired velocity. Consequently very large and strong fulminating caps  have to be employed. Smokeless powder is not ignited in the same manner  as black powder. Something besides ignition is necessary. Black powder  simply requires to be set on fire; while a smokeless powder, on the  contrary, not only requires that it be set on fire, but that a certain  degree of pressure be set up inside of the cartridge case. For instance,  if a primer of a certain size should be found to operate perfectly well,  giving prompt ignition in the cartridge case of a rifle of small  caliber, it would be found that the same primer would not ignite a  charge of the same powder if loaded into a gun of one inch caliber. In  the latter case a few grains only lying near the primer would be  ignited, and these would soon become extinguished by sudden release of  pressure bringing about a cooling effect due to expansion of the gases.  In small cartridges a large fulminating cap is all that is required, but  in large cartridges it is necessary to resort to additional means of  ignition.    In France, where experiments were conducted with a 37 millimeter Maxim  gun, it was found to be impracticable to use a fulminating cap  sufficiently large to ignite the powder and cause it to burn. Therefore,  a small ignition charge of black powder was employed, it being put in a  capsule or bag and placed next the primer. On firing at the rate of 300  rounds per minute, the black powder, though small in quantity, produced  a cloud of smoke through which it was quite impossible to see. The  inventor of the gun then prepared for the French some wafers of  pyroxyline canvas, which were placed next to the primer, securing  thereby prompt ignition without the production of any smoke.    Smokeless powder, made as I have described, cannot be detonated by a  fulminating cap of any size or by any means whatever. A large charge of  fulminate of mercury placed inside the cartridge case next the primer  will not detonate the powder, it serving only to ignite it and cause it  to explode. But even this would not cause the powder to explode except  it be confined behind a projectile, that sufficient pressure may be run  up to make it burn in its own gases.    Some curious experiments with smokeless powder may be tried with a shot  gun. If the fulminating cap be large, the powder fine, the wads numerous  and hard and the charge of shot heavy, all being well rammed down, and  the paper case well spun over the last pasteboard wad, a charge of  smokeless powder about equal in weight to one-half of what would be  employed of black powder would give about the same results as black  powder.

The number of slaves in  the vicinity of Detroit in 1773 were ninety-six; 127 in 1778; and 175 in  1783. Detroit had a colored population of 15 in 1805 and two years later  a number had sufficiently increased for Governor Hull to organize a  company of militia among them. The increase had been due to the coming  of refugees from Canada. The Census of 1810 showed 17 slaves in Detroit;  that of 1830 shows 32 in Michigan and an enumeration subsequent to 1836  shows that all were dead or manumitted. See Census of the United States.    [5] Laws of Michigan, 1827.    [6] This riot occurred on June 14, 1833. Thornton Blackburn and his  wife, the alleged runaways from Kentucky, were lodged in jail pending  the departure of a boat. A crowd of colored men and women, armed with  clubs, stones and pistols, gathered in the vicinity of the jail. Upon  the pretext of visiting Blackburn's wife a colored woman was admitted to  the jail and by an exchange of clothing effected the escape of the  prisoner who immediately crossed into Canada. Some time thereafter the  sheriff attempted to take his other prisoner to the boat, but was  knocked down and badly beaten. During the encounter the sheriff fired  into the mob, but Blackburn was rescued and carried to Canada. This  caused a great disturbance among the white people. They armed themselves  and attacked the blacks wherever they could be found. The city council  convened and undertook to dispose of the trouble by enforcing the law of  1827 requiring that colored people should stay off the streets at night.

[7] Five years after the organization of the Detroit Anti-Slavery  Society Henry Bibb, an ex-slave, came to the city and lectured for two  years under the auspices of the Liberty Association, which was promoting  the election of anti-slavery candidates. Public sentiment against  slavery was becoming such that the Legislature of Michigan passed a law  prohibiting the use of jails to detain fugitives. Frederick Douglass and  John Brown found many friends of their cause in Detroit. Of the many  organized efforts made to circumvent the law and assist fugitives one  society purchased land and established homes for as many as 50 families  between 1850 and 1872. Farmer, \"History of Detroit and Michigan,\" I,  Chapter XLVIII.    [8] The immediate cause of the riot in Detroit was the arrest,  conviction, and imprisonment of a colored man called William Faulkner  charged with committing an assault on a little girl. Feeling that the  prisoner was guilty, bands of ruffians swept through the streets and  mercilessly beat colored people. Seven years later it was discovered  that Faulkner was innocent and to reimburse him for his losses and  humiliation the same ruffians raised a handsome sum to set him up in  business. See Farmer's History of Detroit and Michigan, Chapter XLVIII.    [8a] A study of the directories of Detroit shows that a considerable  number of Negroes had entered the higher pursuits of labor. See  especially the Detroit Directory for 1865.    [9] Simmons, \"Men of Mark,\" 356.

THE PASSING TRADITION AND THE AFRICAN CIVILIZATION        A close examination shows that what we know about the Negro both of the  present and the past vitally affects our opinions concerning him. Men's  beliefs concerning things are to a large extent determined by where they  live and what has been handed down to them. We believe in a hell of roaring  flames where in the fiercest of heat the souls of the wicked are subject to  eternal burnings. This idea of hell was evolved in the deserts of the  Arabian Peninsula where heat is one of the greatest forces of nature with  which man has to contend. Among the native tribes of Northern Siberia  dwelling in the regions of perpetual ice and snow, hell is a place filled  with great chunks of ice upon which the souls of the wicked are placed and  there subjected to eternal freezings. This idea of hell was evolved in the  regions where man is in a continual battle with the cold.    The beliefs of Negroes concerning themselves have to a large extent been  made for them. The reader no doubt will be interested to know that the  prevailing notions concerning the inferiority of the Negro grew up to a  large extent as the concomitant to Negro slavery in this country. The  bringing of the first Negroes from Africa as slaves was justified on the  grounds that they were heathen. It was not right, it was argued, for  Christians to enslave Christians, but they could enslave heathen, who as a  result would have an opportunity to become Christians. These Negro slaves  did actually become Christians and as a result the colonists were forced  to find other grounds to justify their continuation of the system. The  next argument was that they were different from white people. Here we  have a large part of the beginnings of the doctrine of the inferiority of  the Negro.    When, about 1830, anti-slavery agitation arose in this country, a new set  of arguments were brought forward to justify slavery. First in importance  were those taken from the Bible. Science also was called upon and brought  forward a large number of facts to demonstrate that by nature the Negro  was especially fitted to be a slave. It happened that about this time  anthropology was being developed. Racial differences were some of the  things which especially interested scientists in this field. The races  were defined according to certain physical characteristics. These, it was  asserted, determined the superiority or inferiority of races. The true  Negro race, said the early anthropologists, had characteristics which  especially indicated its inferiority. Through our geographies, histories  and encyclopedias we have become familiar with representations of this  so-called true Negro, whose chief characteristics were a black skin, woolly  hair, protuberant lips and a receding forehead. Caricaturists seized upon  these characteristics and popularized them in cartoons, in songs and in  other ways. Thus it happened that the Negro, through the descriptions that  he got of himself, has come largely to believe in his inherent inferiority  and that to attain superiority he must become like the white man in color,  in achievements and, in fact, along all lines.    In recent years it has been asked, \"Why cannot the Negro attain superiority  along lines of his own,\" that is, instead of simply patterning after what  the white man has done, why cannot the Negro through music, art, history,  and science, make his own special contributions to the progress of the  world? This question has arisen because in the fields of science and  history there have been brought forward a number of facts which prove this  possibility. First of all, the leading scientists in the field of  anthropology are telling us that while there are differences of races,  there are no characteristics which per se indicate that one race is  inferior or superior to another. The existing differences are differences  in kind not in value. On the other hand, whatever superiority one race has  attained over another has been largely due to environment.    A German writer in a discussion of the origin of African civilizations  said some time ago \"What bold investigators, great pioneers, still find to  tell us in civilizations nearer home, proves more and more clearly that we  are ignorant of hoary Africa. Somewhat of its present, perhaps, we know,  but of its past little. Open an illustrated geography and compare the  'Type of the African Negro,' the bluish-black fellow of the protuberant  lips, the flattened nose, the stupid expression and the short curly hair,  with the tall bronze figures from Dark Africa with which we have of late  become familiar, their almost fine-cut features, slightly arched nose,  long hair, etc., and you have an example of the problems pressing for  solution. In other respects, too, the genuine African of the interior  bears no resemblance to the accepted Negro type as it figures on drug and  cigar store signs, wearing a shabby stovepipe hat, plaid trousers, and a  vari-colored coat. A stroll through the corridors of the Berlin Museum of  Ethnology teaches that the real African need by no means resort to the  rags and tatters of bygone European splendor. He has precious ornaments of  his own, "]]]
