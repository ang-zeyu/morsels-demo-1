All the process  was clearly explained; the vessels, the retorts, the mixtures, and the  proper times and seasons for the experiment. But as ill-luck would have  it, the possession of the philosopher's stone or prime agent in the work  was presupposed. This was a difficulty which was not to be got over.  It was like telling a starving man how to cook a beefsteak, instead of  giving him the money to buy one. But Nicholas did not despair; and set  about studying the hieroglyphics and allegorical representations with  which the book abounded. He soon convinced himself that it had been one  of the sacred books of the Jews, and that it was taken from the temple  of Jerusalem on its destruction by Titus. The process of reasoning by  which he arrived at this conclusion is not stated.    From some expression in the treatise, he learned that the allegorical  drawings on the fourth and fifth leaves, enshrined the secret of the  philosopher's stone, without which all the fine Latin of the directions  was utterly unavailing. He invited all the alchymists and learned men  of Paris to come and examine them, but they all departed as wise as they  came. Nobody could make anything either of Nicholas or his pictures; and  some even went so far as to say that his invaluable book was not worth  a farthing. This was not to be borne; and Nicholas resolved to discover  the great secret by himself, without troubling the philosophers. He  found on the first page, of the fourth leaf, the picture of Mercury,  attacked by an old man resembling Saturn or Time. The latter had an  hourglass on his head, and in his hand a scythe, with which he aimed  a blow at Mercury's feet. The reverse of the leaf represented a flower  growing on a mountain top, shaken rudely by the wind, with a blue stalk,  red and white blossoms, and leaves of pure gold. Around it were a great  number of dragons and griffins. On the first page of the fifth leaf  was a fine garden, in the midst of which was a rose tree in full bloom,  supported against the trunk of a gigantic oak. At the foot of this there  bubbled up a fountain of milk-white water, which forming a small stream,  flowed through the garden, and was afterwards lost in the sands. On  the second page was a King, with a sword in his hand, superintending  a number of soldiers, who, in execution of his orders, were killing a  great multitude of young children, spurning the prayers and tears of  their mothers, who tried to save them from destruction. The blood of the  children was carefully collected by another party of soldiers, and put  into a large vessel, in which two allegorical figures of the Sun and  Moon were bathing themselves.    For twenty-one years poor Nicholas wearied himself with the study  of these pictures, but still he could make nothing of them. His wife  Petronella at last persuaded him to find out some learned Rabbi; but  there was no Rabbi in Paris learned enough to be of any service to him.  The Jews met but small encouragement to fix their abode in France,  and all the chiefs of that people were located in Spain. To Spain  accordingly Nicholas Flamel repaired. He left his book in Paris for  fear, perhaps, that he might be robbed of it on the road; and telling  his neighbours that he was going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St.  James of Compostello, he trudged on foot towards Madrid in search of a  Rabbi. He was absent two years in that country, and made himself known  to a great number of Jews, descendants of those who had been expelled  from France in the reign of Philip Augustus. The believers in the  philosopher's stone give the following account of his adventures:--They  say that at Leon he made the acquaintance of a converted Jew, named  Cauches, a very learned physician, to whom he explained the title and  the nature of his little book. The Doctor was transported with joy  as soon as he heard it named, and immediately resolved to accompany  Nicholas to Paris, that he might have a sight of it. The two set out  together; the Doctor on the way entertaining his companion with the  history of his book, which, if the genuine book he thought it to be,  from the description he had heard of it, was in the handwriting of  Abraham himself, and had been in the possession of personages no less  distinguished than Moses, Joshua, Solomon, and Esdras. It contained  all the secrets of alchymy and of many other sciences, and was the  most valuable book that had ever existed in this world. The Doctor was  himself no mean adept, and Nicholas profited greatly by his discourse,  as in the garb of poor pilgrims they wended their way to Paris,  convinced of their power to turn every old shovel in that capital into  pure gold. But, unfortunately, when they reached Orleans, the Doctor was  taken dangerously ill. Nicholas watched by his bedside, and acted the  double part of a physician and nurse to him; but he died after a few  days, lamenting with his last breath that he had not lived long enough  to see the precious volume. Nicholas rendered the last honours to  his body; and with a sorrowful heart, and not one sous in his pocket,  proceeded home to his wife Petronella. He immediately recommenced  the study of his pictures; but for two whole years he was as far from  understanding them as ever. At last, in the third year, a glimmer of  light stole over his understanding. He recalled some expression of his  friend, the Doctor, which had hitherto escaped his memory, and he found  that all his previous experiments had been conducted on a wrong basis.  He recommenced them now with renewed energy, and at the end of the year  had the satisfaction to see all his toils rewarded. On the 13th January  1382, says Lenglet, he made a projection on mercury, and had some very  excellent silver. On the 25th April following, he converted a large  quantity of mercury into gold, and the great secret was his.    Nicholas was now about eighty years of age, and still a hale and stout  old man. His friends say that, by the simultaneous discovery of the  elixir of life, he found means to keep death at a distance for another  quarter of a century; and that he died in 1415, at the age of 116. In  this interval he had made immense quantities of gold, though to all  outward appearance he was as poor as a mouse. At an early period of his  changed fortune, he had, like a worthy man, taken counsel with his  old wife Petronella, as to the best use he could make of his wealth.  Petronella replied, that as unfortunately they had no children, the best  thing he could do, was to build hospitals and endow churches. Nicholas  thought so too, especially when he began to find that his elixir could  not keep off death, and that the grim foe was making rapid advances upon  him. He richly endowed the church of St. Jacques de la Boucherie, near  the Rue de Marivaux, where he had all his life resided, besides seven  others in different parts of the kingdom. He also endowed fourteen  hospitals, and built three chapels.    The fame of his great wealth and his munificent benefactions soon  spread over all the country, and he was visited, among others, by the  celebrated Doctors of that day, Jean Gerson, Jean de Courtecuisse, and  Pierre d'Ailli. They found him in his humble apartment, meanly clad, and  eating porridge out of an earthen vessel; and with regard to his secret,  as impenetrable as all his predecessors in alchymy. His fame reached  the ears of the King, Charles VI, who sent M. de Cramoisi, the Master  of Requests, to find out whether Nicholas had indeed discovered the  philosopher's stone. But M. de Cramoisi took nothing by his visit; all  his attempts to sound the alchymist were unavailing, and he returned to  his royal master no wiser than he came. It was in this year, 1414, that  he lost his faithful Petronella. He did not long survive her; but died  in the following year, and was buried with great pomp by the grateful  priests of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.    The great wealth of Nicholas Flamel is undoubted, as the records of  several churches and hospitals in France can testify. That he practised  alchymy is equally certain, as he left behind several works upon the  subject.    Those who knew him well, and who were incredulous about the  philosopher's stone, give a very satisfactory solution of the secret of  his wealth. They say that he was always a miser and a usurer; that his  journey to Spain was undertaken with very different motives from those  pretended by the alchymists; that, in fact, he went to collect debts  due from Jews in that country to their brethren in Paris, and that he  charged a commission of fully cent. per cent. in consideration of the  difficulty of collecting and the dangers of the road; that when he  possessed thousands, he lived upon almost nothing; and was the general  money-lender, at enormous profits, of all the dissipated young men at  the French court.    Among the works written by Nicholas Flamel on the subject of alchymy, is  \"The Philosophic Summary,\" a poem, reprinted in 1735, as an appendix  to the third volume of the \"Roman de la Rose.\" He also wrote three  treatises upon natural philosophy, and an alchymic allegory, entitled  \"Le Desir desire.\" Specimens of his writing, and a fac-simile of the  drawings in his book of Abraham, may be seen in Salmon's \"Bibliotheque  des Philosophes Chimiques.\" The writer of the article, \"Flamel,\" in the  \"Biographie Universelle,\" says that, for a hundred years after the death  of Flamel, many of the adepts believed that he was still alive, and that  he would live for upwards of six hundred years. The house he formerly  occupied, at the corner of the Rue de Marivaux, has been often taken by  credulous speculators, and ransacked from top to bottom, in the hopes  that gold might be found. A report was current in Paris, not long  previous to the year 1816, that some lodgers had found in the cellars  several jars filled with a dark-coloured ponderous matter."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#7)"],[1,"as Aquila (Ak-we-la) or Flying Eagle. In the allegorical  astronomy of that remote period these genii of the seasons were  designated as beasts, and as such we find them referred to in  Revelation iv. 7, which reads as follows: \"And the first beast was like  a lion (Leo), and the second beast like a calf (Taurus, the bull calf),  and the third beast had a face as a man, (Aquarius, the waterman) and  the fourth beast was like a flying eagle (Aquila).\" In the first chapter  of Ezekiel, the prophet, the genii of the seasons are referred to in  the same manner.    These genii of the seasons, standing, imaginarily, at the four corners  of the heavens, were called corner-keepers, and making them witnesses  to God Sol in his apparent annual revolution, the founders of the  Astral Worship designated them as Archangels, Evangelists, God-Spellers  or Gospel-Bearers, and claiming inspiration from them, composed four  different histories of the birth and earth-life of the incarnate  saviour, to each of which they attached a name, and called these  records the Gospel story. In its Chaldean version, the names of  Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and Uriel were given them; but while the  first two of these are mentioned in the Christian Gospel story, its  authors gave to the Evangelists the names of Matthew, Mark, Luke and  John. Thus knowing the true signification of the Disciples and  Evangelists, the very pertinent question presents itself: If they are  not the genii of the months and the seasons, why are there just twelve  of the one and four of the other?    [See plate7.gif]      Half Year of Increasing Days.    In the ancient astrolatry, the half year of increasing days, extending  from the Winter to the Summer Solstice, was personified by the  composite figure representing the constellations of Taurus and  Aquarius, which, constituted of the winged body of a bull and the head  and beard of a man, was called the Cherubim. This personification we  find portrayed upon the Assyrian marbles on exhibition in the British  Museum.      Half Year of Decreasing Days.    The half year of decreasing days, extending from the Summer to the  Winter Solstice, was personified by the figure, which, representing the  constellations of Leo and Aquila, and composed of the winged body and  limbs of a lion, with the head of an eagle, was called the Seraphim.  These last two personifications constituted the Archangels of the  ancient Astral Worship.      Last Quarter of the Year.    The last quarter of the year was personified in the ancient allegories  as a decrepit old man, who, stung by a Scorpion (Scorpio), and fatally  wounded by an arrow from the quiver of an archer (Saggitarius) dies at  the Winter Solstice; and, after lying in the grave for the space of  three days, is brought to life again. Such was the personification  referred to in the Christian Gospel-story as having been raised from  the grave by the mandate, \"Come forth, Lazarus.\" Thus have we shown  that the elders and the saints; the angels, and the Archangels; the  Cherubim and Seraphim; and also poor old Lazarus, are but  personifications of the several divisions of time.        ZODIACAL SYMBOLS OF SOLAR WORSHIP.    Having shown that the founders of the ancient astrolatry accorded  homage to God Sol as Lord of Evil, under the symbol of the serpent, and  marked the beginning of his reign, as such, by the constellation  \"Serpens\" placed in conjunction with the Autumnal Equinox; we will now  direct attention to the symbols under which he was worshipped as Lord  of Good, which, corresponding to the form of the constellation in which  occurred the Vernal Equinox, and which was changed to correspond to the  form of the succeeding constellation as that Cardinal point passed into  it, by that process, known in Astronomy, as the precession of the  Equinoxes, its explanation becomes essential to a correct understanding  of our subject.    After long observation, aided by the telescope, of which they were  undoubtedly the original inventors, the ancient Astrologers discovered  that the Sun, in making his apparent annual revolution, did not return  to the same point in the heavens, but fell behind that of the preceding  year, at the rate of 50 1/4 seconds of a degree annually. At this rate  of precession, which modern, calculation has confirmed, it requires 71  2-3 years for the Cardinal points to pass through one degree on the  Ecliptic, and 2150 years through thirty degrees, or one sign of the  Zodiac. The knowledge of this process affording an exact chronology, we  are enabled, not only to determine the origin of these symbols, but to  approximate, very nearly, to the respective dates of their adoption.      The Sphinx.    From the teachings of Astronomy we learn that the Summer Solstice is  now occupying the point between the signs of Taurus and Gemini, from  which we know that that Cardinal point has passed through three whole  signs since it was between the signs of Leo and Virgo, and we have but  to multiply 2,150 by 3 to determine that it has been about 6,450 years  ago. Hence, the tourist to the Nile valley, when viewing, near the base  of old Cheops, the great Egyptian pyramid, a colossal head and bust of  a woman, carved in stone, and learns that it is attached to a body, in  the form of a lion in a crouching attitude 146 feet long, hidden  beneath the shifting sands of the Libyan desert; if possessed of the  knowledge of the precession of the Equinoxes, he will be enabled to  solve the riddle of the Sphinx by recognizing in that grotesque  monument the mid-summer symbol of solar worship, when the Summer  Solstice was between the signs of Leo and Virgo.      The Dragon.    When the Summer Solstice was between the signs of Leo and Virgo, the  Winter Solstice was between those of Aquarius and Pisces, and the  figure composed of the body of a man with the tail of a fish became the  mid-winter symbol of solar worship. Such was the form of this symbol to  which the ancient Phoenicians paid homage to the Lord under the name of  Dagon.      The Bull.    At the same time the Summer Solstice entered the sign of Leo, the  Vernal Equinox entered that of Taurus, and the bull becoming the spring  symbol of solar worship--the Lord was designated in the ancient  allegories as the bull of God which taketh away the sin of the world;  which, shorn of its allegorical sense, signifies the sun in Taurus, or  sun of spring, which taketh away the evil of Winter. Such is the  purport of hieroglyphical inscriptions upon papyrus rolls found in  Egypt, and engraved upon obelisks erected in the Nile valley, one of  which has been recently brought to the City of New York and set up in  Central Park. In the East Indies this symbol was represented by the  figure of a bull with the solar disk between his horns; and the  Egyptians, who were of Hindoo origin, perpetuating it in their \"Apis,\"  it was reproduced in the golden calf of the ancient Israelites. The  Assyrians represented this symbol by the figure of a winged bull with  the face and beard of a man; the Phoenicians, in their \"Baal,\" by the  figure of a man with a bull's head and horns; and the small silver  bull's heads with golden horns, recently discovered by Dr. Schliemann  in the ruins of Mycenae, were jewels worn by the women of that ancient  city, when the Vernal Equinox was in the sign of Taurus.      The Ram.    By deducting 2,150 years from 6,450, we determine that about 4,300  years; ago the Vernal Equinox entered the sign of Aries, and the spring  symbol of solar worship, changing from the bull to the ram, was  represented by ram-headed figures, two of which, found in Egypt, are on  exhibition in the British Museum. Then the text which read the bull of  God, was changed to the Ram of God which taketh away the sins of the  world.      The Lamb.    Ultimately attaching a meek and lowly disposition to the imaginary  incarnations of the mythical genius of the sun, the symbol of the ram  was changed to that of the lamb, and the text in the allegories, which  read the Ram of God, was changed to read \"The Lamb of God which taketh  away the sin of the World,\" John i, 29. The explanation we have given  relative to the Zodiacal Symbols of solar worship makes the assurance  doubly sure that the originals of the New Testament were composed when  the Vernal Equinox was in the sign of Aries, as will be shown  hereafter. Having adopted the symbol of the lamb, it was represented by  several forms of what is known as Agnus Dei, or Lamb of God, one of  which was in the form of a bleeding lamb with a vase attached into  which blood is flowing, which originated in reference to the shedding  of blood as a vicarious atonement for sin. But the most comprehensive  form of this symbol in its astronomical signification, was represented  by the figure of a lamb in a standing attitude, supporting the circle  of the Zodiac, divided into quarters to denote the seasons. At each of  the cardinal points there was a small cross, and the lamb held in its  uplifted fore-foot a larger cross, the long arm of which was made to  cut the celestial equator at the angle of 23 1/2 degrees, the true  angle of obliquity of the Ecliptic. This symbol is still retained in  the Catholic Church.    [See plate8.gif]      The Fish.    By deducting 2,150 years from 4,300 we determine that about 2,150 years  ago the Vernal Equinox entered the sign of Pisces; and although the  original version of the New Testament was founded upon the symbol of  the lamb, it is a historical fact that for centuries after the  beginning of our era, the Christians paid homage to the Lord under the  symbol of the fish; but ultimately going into desuetude, the lamb was  retained as the distinguishing symbol of the Christian religion until  the year 680, at which date another was substituted, as will be shown  under our next heading.
