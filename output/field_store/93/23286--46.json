If you get wet you'll be soggy and can't walk. Your  colors might run, too,\" he said.    \"Don't my colors run whenever I run?\" she asked.    \"Not in the way I mean. If they get wet, the reds and greens and  yellows and purples of your patches might run into each other and  become just a blur--no color at all, you know.\"    \"Then,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"I'll be careful, for if I spoiled my  splendid colors I would cease to be beautiful.\"    \"Pah!\" sneered the Glass Cat, \"such colors are not beautiful; they're  ugly, and in bad taste. Please notice that my body has no color at all.  I'm transparent, except for my exquisite red heart and my lovely pink  brains--you can see 'em work.\"    \"Shoo--shoo--shoo!\" cried Scraps, dancing around and laughing. \"And  your horrid green eyes, Miss Bungle! You can't see your eyes, but we  can, and I notice you're very proud of what little color you have.  Shoo, Miss Bungle, shoo--shoo--shoo! If you were all colors and many  colors, as I am, you'd be too stuck up for anything.\" She leaped over  the cat and back again, and the startled Bungle crept close to a tree  to escape her. This made Scraps laugh more heartily than ever, and she  said:        \"Whoop-te-doodle-doo!      The cat has lost her shoe.      Her tootsie's bare, but she don't care,      So what's the odds to you?\"      \"Dear me, Ojo,\" said the cat; \"don't you think the creature is a little  bit crazy?\"    \"It may be,\" he answered, with a puzzled look.    \"If she continues her insults I'll scratch off her suspender-button  eyes,\" declared the cat.    \"Don't quarrel, please,\" pleaded the boy, rising to resume the journey.  \"Let us be good comrades and as happy and cheerful as possible, for we  are likely to meet with plenty of trouble on our way.\"    It was nearly sundown when they came to the edge of the forest and saw  spread out before them a delightful landscape. There were broad blue  fields stretching for miles over the valley, which was dotted  everywhere with pretty, blue domed houses, none of which, however, was  very near to the place where they stood. Just at the point where the  path left the forest stood a tiny house covered with leaves from the  trees, and before this stood a Munchkin man with an axe in his hand. He  seemed very much surprised when Ojo and Scraps and the Glass Cat came  out of the woods, but as the Patchwork Girl approached nearer he sat  down upon a bench and laughed so hard that he could not speak for a  long time.    This man was a woodchopper and lived all alone in the little house. He  had bushy blue whiskers and merry blue eyes and his blue clothes were  quite old and worn.    \"Mercy me!\" exclaimed the woodchopper, when at last he could stop  laughing. \"Who would think such a funny harlequin lived in the Land of  Oz? Where did you come from, Crazy-quilt?\"    \"Do you mean me?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    \"Of course,\" he replied.    \"You misjudge my ancestry. I'm not a crazy-quilt; I'm patchwork,\" she  said.    \"There's no difference,\" he replied, beginning to laugh again. \"When my  old grandmother sews such things together she calls it a crazy-quilt;  but I never thought such a jumble could come to life.\"    \"It was the Magic Powder that did it,\" explained Ojo.    \"Oh, then you have come from the Crooked Magician on the mountain. I  might have known it, for--Well, I declare! here's a glass cat. But the  Magician will get in trouble for this; it's against the law for anyone  to work magic except Glinda the Good and the royal Wizard of Oz. If you  people--or things--or glass spectacles--or crazy-quilts--or whatever  you are, go near the Emerald City, you'll be arrested.\"    \"We're going there, anyhow,\" declared Scraps, sitting upon the bench  and swinging her stuffed legs.        \"If any of us takes a rest,      We'll be arrested sure,      And get no restitution      'Cause the rest we must endure.\"      \"I see,\" said the woodchopper, nodding; \"you're as crazy as the  crazy-quilt you're made of.\"    \"She really is crazy,\" remarked the Glass Cat. \"But that isn't to be  wondered at when you remember how many different things she's made of.  For my part, I'm made of pure glass--except my jewel heart and my  pretty pink brains. Did you notice my brains, stranger? You can see 'em  work.\"    \"So I can,\" replied the woodchopper; \"but I can't see that they  accomplish much. A glass cat is a useless sort of thing, but a  Patchwork Girl is really useful. She makes me laugh, and laughter is  the best thing in life. There was once a woodchopper, a friend of mine,  who was made all of tin, and I used to laugh every time I saw him.\"    \"A tin woodchopper?\" said Ojo. \"That is strange.\"    \"My friend wasn't always tin,\" said the man, \"but he was careless with  his axe, and used to chop himself very badly. Whenever he lost an arm  or a leg he had it replaced with tin; so after a while he was all tin.\"    \"And could he chop wood then?\" asked the boy.    \"He could if he didn't rust his tin joints. But one day he met Dorothy  in the forest and went with her to the Emerald City, where he made his  fortune. He is now one of the favorites of Princess Ozma, and she has  made him the Emperor of the Winkies--the Country where all is yellow.\"    \"Who is Dorothy?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    \"A little maid who used to live in Kansas, but is now a Princess of Oz.  She's Ozma's best friend, they say, and lives with her in the royal  palace.\"    \"Is Dorothy made of tin?\" inquired Ojo.    \"Is she patchwork, like me?\" inquired Scraps.    \"No,\" said the man; \"Dorothy is flesh, just as I am. I know of only one  tin person, and that is Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman; and there will  never be but one Patchwork Girl, for any magician that sees you will  refuse to make another one like you.\"    \"I suppose we shall see the Tin Woodman, for we are going to the  Country of the Winkies,\" said the boy.    \"What for?\" asked the woodchopper.    \"To get the left wing of a yellow butterfly.\"    \"It is a long journey,\" declared the man, \"and you will go through  lonely parts of Oz and cross rivers and traverse dark forests before  you get there.\"    \"Suits me all right,\" said Scraps. \"I'll get a chance to see the  country.\"    \"You're crazy, girl. Better crawl into a rag-bag and hide there; or  give yourself to some little girl to play with. Those who travel are  likely to meet trouble; that's why I stay at home.\"    The woodchopper then invited them all to stay the night at his little  hut, but they were anxious to get on and so left him and continued  along the path, which was broader, now, and more distinct.    They expected to reach some other house before it grew dark, but the  twilight was brief and Ojo soon began to fear they had made a mistake  in leaving the woodchopper.    \"I can scarcely see the path,\" he said at last. \"Can you see it,  Scraps?\"    \"No,\" replied the Patchwork Girl, who was holding fast to the boy's arm  so he could guide her.    \"I can see,\" declared the Glass Cat. \"My eyes are better than yours,  and my pink brains--\"    \"Never mind your pink brains, please,\" said Ojo hastily; \"just run  ahead and show us the way. Wait a minute and I'll tie a string to you;  for then you can lead us.\"    He got a string from his pocket and tied it around the cat's neck, and  after that the creature guided them along the path. They had proceeded  in this way for about an hour when a twinkling blue light appeared  ahead of them.    \"Good! there's a house at last,\" cried Ojo. \"When we reach it the good  people will surely welcome us and give us a night's lodging.\" But  however far they walked the light seemed to get no nearer, so by and by  the cat stopped short, saying:    \"I think the light is traveling, too, and we shall never be able to  catch up with it. But here is a house by the roadside, so why go  farther?\"    \"Where is the house, Bungle?\"    \"Just here beside us, Scraps.\"    Ojo was now able to see a small house near the pathway. It was dark and  silent, but the boy was tired and wanted to rest, so he went up to the  door and knocked.    \"Who is there?\" cried a voice from within.    \"I am Ojo the Unlucky, and with me are Miss Scraps Patchwork and the  Glass Cat,\" he replied.    \"What do you want?\" asked the Voice.    \"A place to sleep,\" said Ojo.    \"Come in, then; but don't make any noise, and you must go directly to  bed,\" returned the Voice.    Ojo unlatched the door and entered. It was very dark inside and he  could see nothing at all. But the cat exclaimed: \"Why, there's no one  here!\"    \"There must be,\" said the boy. \"Some one spoke to me.\"    \"I can see everything in the room,\" replied the cat, \"and no one is  present but ourselves. But here are three beds, all made up, so we may  as well go to sleep.\"    \"What is sleep?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    \"It's what you do when you go to bed,\" said Ojo.    \"But why do you go to bed?\" persisted the Patchwork Girl.    \"Here, here! You are making altogether too much noise,\" cried the Voice  they had heard before. \"Keep quiet, strangers, and go to bed.\"    The cat, which could see in the dark, looked sharply around for the  owner of the Voice, but could discover no one, although the Voice had  seemed close beside them. She arched her back a little and seemed  afraid. Then she whispered to Ojo: \"Come!\" and led him to a bed.    With his hands the boy felt of the bed and found it was big and soft,  with feather pillows and plenty of blankets. So he took off his shoes  and hat and crept into the bed. Then the cat led Scraps to another bed  and the Patchwork Girl was puzzled to know what to do with it.    \"Lie down and keep quiet,\" whispered the cat, warningly.    \"Can't I sing?\" asked Scraps.    \"No.\"    \"Can't I whistle?\" asked Scraps.    \"N"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#7)"],[1,"the rear, and if she tired  with walking the girl got upon Hank's back and let the stout little  donkey carry her for awhile.    At nightfall they came to some trees that grew beside a tiny brook and  here they made camp and rested until morning. Then away they tramped,  finding berries and fruits here and there which satisfied the hunger of  Betsy, Shaggy and Hank, so that they were well content with their lot.    It surprised Betsy to see the Rose Princess partake of their food, for  she considered her a fairy; but when she mentioned this to Polychrome,  the Rainbow's Daughter explained that when Ozga was driven out of her  Rose Kingdom she ceased to be a fairy and would never again be more  than a mere mortal. Polychrome, however, was a fairy wherever she  happened to be, and if she sipped a few dewdrops by moonlight for  refreshment no one ever saw her do it.    As they continued their wandering journey, direction meant very little  to them, for they were hopelessly lost in this strange country. Shaggy  said it would be best to go toward the mountains, as the natural  entrance to Ruggedo's underground cavern was likely to be hidden in  some rocky, deserted place; but mountains seemed all around them except  in the one direction that they had come from, which led to the Rose  Kingdom and the sea. Therefore it mattered little which way they  traveled.    By and by they espied a faint trail that looked like a path and after  following this for some time they reached a crossroads. Here were many  paths, leading in various directions, and there was a signpost so old  that there were now no words upon the sign. At one side was an old  well, with a chain windlass for drawing water, yet there was no house  or other building anywhere in sight.    While the party halted, puzzled which way to proceed, the mule  approached the well and tried to look into it.    \"He's thirsty,\" said Betsy.    \"It's a dry well,\" remarked Shaggy. \"Probably there has been no water  in it for many years. But, come; let us decide which way to travel.\"    No one seemed able to decide that. They sat down in a group and tried  to consider which road might be the best to take. Hank, however, could  not keep away from the well and finally he reared up on his hind legs,  got his head over the edge and uttered a loud \"Hee-haw!\" Betsy watched  her animal friend curiously.    \"I wonder if he sees anything down there?\" she said.    At this, Shaggy rose and went over to the well to investigate, and  Betsy went with him. The Princess and Polychrome, who had become fast  friends, linked arms and sauntered down one of the roads, to find an  easy path.    \"Really,\" said Shaggy, \"there does seem to be something at the bottom  of this old well.\"    \"Can't we pull it up, and see what it is?\" asked the girl.    There was no bucket at the end of the windlass chain, but there was a  big hook that at one time was used to hold a bucket. Shaggy let down  this hook, dragged it around on the bottom and then pulled it up. An  old hoopskirt came with it, and Betsy laughed and threw it away. The  thing frightened Hank, who had never seen a hoopskirt before, and he  kept a good distance away from it.    Several other objects the Shaggy Man captured with the hook and drew  up, but none of these was important.    \"This well seems to have been the dump for all the old rubbish in the  country,\" he said, letting down the hook once more. \"I guess I've  captured everything now. No--the hook has caught again. Help me, Betsy!  Whatever this thing is, it's heavy.\"    She ran up and helped him turn the windlass and after much effort a  confused mass of copper came in sight.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Shaggy. \"Here is a surprise, indeed!\"    \"What is it?\" inquired Betsy, clinging to the windlass and panting for  breath.    For answer the Shaggy Man grasped the bundle of copper and dumped it  upon the ground, free of the well. Then he turned it over with his  foot, spread it out, and to Betsy's astonishment the thing proved to be  a copper man.    \"Just as I thought,\" said Shaggy, looking hard at the object. \"But  unless there are two copper men in the world this is the most  astonishing thing I ever came across.\"    At this moment the Rainbow's Daughter and the Rose Princess approached  them, and Polychrome said:    \"What have you found, Shaggy One?\"    \"Either an old friend, or a stranger,\" he replied.    \"Oh, here's a sign on his back!\" cried Betsy, who had knelt down to  examine the man. \"Dear me; how funny! Listen to this.\"    Then she read the following words, engraved upon the copper plates of  the man's body:                SMITH & TINKER'S    Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,    Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking              MECHANICAL MAN    Fitted with our Special Clockwork Attachment.    Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.      \"Isn't he wonderful!\" exclaimed the Princess.    \"Yes; but here's more,\" said Betsy, reading from another engraved plate:                  DIRECTIONS FOR USING:      For THINKING:--Wind the Clockwork      Man under his left arm, (marked No. 1).    For SPEAKING:--Wind  the  Clockwork      Man under his right arm, (marked No. 2).    For WALKING and ACTION:--Wind Clockwork Man      in the middle of his back, (marked No. 3).      N. B.--This Mechanism is guaranteed to    work perfectly for a thousand years.      \"If he's guaranteed for a thousand years,\" said Polychrome, \"he ought  to work yet.\"    \"Of course,\" replied Shaggy. \"Let's wind him up.\"    In order to do this they were obliged to set the copper man upon his  feet, in an upright position, and this was no easy task. He was  inclined to topple over, and had to be propped again and again. The  girls assisted Shaggy, and at last Tik-Tok seemed to be balanced and  stood alone upon his broad feet.    \"Yes,\" said Shaggy, looking at the copper man carefully, \"this must be,  indeed, my old friend Tik-Tok, whom I left ticking merrily in the Land  of Oz. But how he came to this lonely place, and got into that old  well, is surely a mystery.\"    \"If we wind him, perhaps he will tell us,\" suggested Betsy. \"Here's the  key, hanging to a hook on his back. What part of him shall I wind up  first?\"    \"His thoughts, of course,\" said Polychrome, \"for it requires thought to  speak or move intelligently.\"    So Betsy wound him under his left arm, and at once little flashes of  light began to show in the top of his head, which was proof that he had  begun to think.    \"Now, then,\" said Shaggy, \"wind up his phonograph.\"    \"What's that?\" she asked.    \"Why, his talking-machine. His thoughts may be interesting, but they  don't tell us anything.\"    So Betsy wound the copper man under his right arm, and then from the  interior of his copper body came in jerky tones the words: \"Ma-ny  thanks!\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried Shaggy, joyfully, and he slapped Tik-Tok upon the back  in such a hearty manner that the copper man lost his balance and  tumbled to the ground in a heap. But the clockwork that enabled him to  speak had been wound up and he kept saying: \"Pick-me-up! Pick-me-up!  Pick-me-up!\" until they had again raised him and balanced him upon his  feet, when he added politely: \"Ma-ny thanks!\"    \"He won't be self-supporting until we wind up his action,\" remarked  Shaggy; so Betsy wound it, as tight as she could--for the key turned  rather hard--and then Tik-Tok lifted his feet, marched around in a  circle and ended by stopping before the group and making them all a low  bow.    \"How in the world did you happen to be in that well, when I left you  safe in Oz?\" inquired Shaggy.    \"It is a long sto-ry,\" replied Tik-Tok, \"but I'll tell it in a few  words. Af-ter you had gone in search of your broth-er, Oz-ma saw you  wan-der-ing in strange lands when-ev-er she looked in her mag-ic  pic-ture, and she also saw your broth-er in the Nome King's cavern; so  she sent me to tell you where to find your broth-er and told me to help  you if I could. The Sor-cer-ess, Glin-da the Good, trans-port-ed me to  this place in the wink of an eye; but here I met the Nome King  him-self--old Rug-ge-do, who is called in these parts the Met-al  Mon-arch. Rug-ge-do knew what I had come for, and he was so an-gry that  he threw me down the well. Af-ter my works ran down I was help-less  un-til you came a-long and pulled me out a-gain. Ma-ny thanks.\"    \"This is, indeed, good news,\" said Shaggy. \"I suspected that my brother  was the prisoner of Ruggedo; but now I know it. Tell us, Tik-Tok, how  shall we get to the Nome King's underground cavern?\"    \"The best way is to walk,\" said Tik-Tok. \"We might crawl, or jump, or  roll o-ver and o-ver until we get there; but the best way is to walk.\"    \"I know; but which road shall we take?\"    \"My ma-chin-er-y is-n't made to tell that,\" replied Tik-Tok.    \"There is more than one entrance to the underground cavern,\" said  Polychrome; \"but old Ruggedo has cleverly concealed every opening, so  that earth dwellers can not intrude in his domain. If we find our way  underground at all, it will be by chance.\"    \"Then,\" said Betsy, \"let us select any road, haphazard, and see where  it leads us.\"    \"That seems sensible,\" declared the Princess. \"It may require a lot of  time for us to find Ruggedo, but we have more time than anything else.\"    \"If you keep me wound up,\" said Tik-Tok, \"I will last a thou-sand  years.\"    \"Then the only question to decide is which way to go,\" added Shaggy,  looking first at one road and then at another.    But while they stood hesitating, a peculiar sound reached their ears--a  sound like the tramping of many feet.    \"What's coming?\" cried Betsy; and then she ran to the left-hand road  and glanced along the path. \"Why, it's an army!\" she exclaimed. \"What  shall we do, hide or run?\"    \"Stand still,\" commanded Shaggy. \"I'm not afraid of an army. If they  prove to be friendly, they can help us; if they are enemies, I'll show  them the Love Magnet.\""]]]
