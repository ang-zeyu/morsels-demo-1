The members  were not photographed daily for the pictorial Press, nor did any cinema  register their entrance into the simple colonial hall where they were to  meet. Notwithstanding this limitation--for no present-day conference or  assembly can proceed with its labours until its members are photographed  for the curiosity of the public--these simple-minded gentlemen--less  intent upon their appearance than their task--were to accomplish a work  of enduring importance.    The extreme care which was taken to preserve this secrecy inviolate, and  its purpose, were indicated in an incident handed down by tradition.    One of the members dropped a copy of a proposition then before the  convention for consideration, and it was found by another of the  delegates and handed to General Washington. At the conclusion of the  session, Washington arose and sternly reprimanded the member for his  carelessness by saying:        \"I must entreat gentlemen to be more careful, lest our transactions      get into the newspapers and disturb the public repose by premature      speculations. I know not whose paper it is, but there it is      [_throwing it down on the table_]. Let him who owns it, take it.\"    He then bowed, picked up his hat and left the room with such evidences  of annoyance that, like school-children, no delegate was willing to  admit the ownership of the paper.    The thought suggests itself: How different the result at Versailles and  Genoa might have been had there been the same reasonable provisions for  discussion and action uninfluenced by too premature public comment of  the day! In these days, when representative government has degenerated  into government by a fleeting public opinion, the price we pay for such  government by, for and of the Press, is too often the inability of  representatives to do what they deem wise and just.    At the close of the convention its records were committed into the  keeping of Washington, with instructions to \"retain the journal and  other papers, subject to order of Congress, if ever formed under the  Constitution.\"    Even the journal consisted of little more than daily memoranda, from  which the minutes ought to have been, but never were, made; and these  fragmentary records of the proceedings of a convention which had been in  continuous session for nearly four months were never published until the  year 1819, or thirty-two years after the close of the convention. Thus,  the American people knew nothing of their greatest convention until a  generation later, and then only a few bones of the mastodon were  exhibited to their curious gaze.    The members of the convention kept its secrets inviolate for many years.  With few exceptions, the great secrets of the convention died with them.  Only one, James Madison, left a comprehensive statement of the more  formal proceedings. With this notable exception, only a few anecdotes,  handed down by tradition, escaped oblivion. The first of the number to  break the pledge of secrecy was Robert Yates, Chief Justice of New York,  who, in 1821, published his recollections; but, as he had left the  convention a few months after it began, his notes ceased with the 5th of  July.    The world would thus have been for ever ignorant of the details of one  of the most remarkable conventions in the annals of mankind had it not  been that one of the ablest of their number, James Madison, regularly  attended the sessions and kept notes from day to day of the debates.  While he was not a stenographer, he had a gift for condensing a speech  and fairly representing its substance. He jealously guarded his Journal  of the Convention until his death. Its very existence was known to few.  He died in 1836, and four years later the government purchased the  manuscript from his widow. Then, for the first time, the curtain was  measurably raised upon the proceedings of a convention which had  created, as we now know, one of the greatest nations in history.  Fifty-three years after the close of the convention, and when nearly  every one of its participants were dead, Madison's Journal was first  published.    When was a great secret better kept? Grateful as posterity must be for  this inestimable gift of great human enterprise, yet even Madison's  careful journal fills one with the deepest regret that this wonderful  debate, which lasted for nearly four months between men of no ordinary  ability, could not have been preserved to the world.    Two or three of the speeches which Madison gives in his Journal are  complete, for when Doctor Franklin spoke he reduced his remarks to  writing and gave a copy to Madison, but of the other speeches only a  fragrant remains. Thus, that \"admirable Crichton,\" Alexander Hamilton,  addressed the convention in a speech that lasted five hours, in which he  stated his philosophy of government, but of that only a short  condensation, and possibly not even an accurate fragment, remains.    Without this extraordinary provision for secrecy, which is so opposed to  modern democratic conventions, and which so little resembles the famous  point as to \"open covenants openly arrived at,\" the convention could not  have accomplished its great work, for these wise men realized that a  statesman cannot act wisely under the observation of a gallery, and  especially when the gallery compels him by the pressure of public  opinion to work as it directs. I recognize that public opinion--often  temporarily uninformed but in the end generally right--does often save  the democracies of the world from the selfish ends of self-seeking and  misguided leadership; but, given noble and wise representatives, they  work best when least influenced by the fleeting passions of the day.    It is evident that if the framers of the Constitution had met, as  similar conventions have within recent years met at Versailles and  Genoa, with the world as their gallery and with the representatives of  the Press as an integral part of the conference, they would have  accomplished nothing. The probability is that the convention would not  have lasted a month if their immediate purpose had been to placate  current opinion. It may be doubted whether such a convention, if called  to-day, either in your country or mine, could achieve like results, for  in this day of unlimited publicity, when men divide not as individuals  but in powerful and organized groups, a constitutional convention would,  I fear, prove a witches' cauldron of class legislation and demagoguery.  Is it not possible that modern democracy is in danger of strangulation  by its present-day methods and ideals? Again the words of Washington  suggest themselves: \"If, to please the people, we offer what we  ourselves disapprove, how can we afterwards defend our work? Let us  raise a standard to which the wise and just can repair.\"    Working with a sad sincerity and with despair in their hearts, this  little band of men wrought a work of surpassing importance, and if they  did not receive the immediate plaudits of the living generation, their  shades can at least solace themselves with the reflection that posterity  has acclaimed their work as one of the greatest political achievements  of man.    The rules of order and the nature of the proceedings thus determined,  the convention opened by an address by Mr. Randolph of Virginia, in  which he submitted, in the form of fifteen points--nearly the number of  the fatal fourteen--the outlines for a new government. He himself in his  opening speech summarized the propositions by candidly confessing \"that  they were not intended for a federal government\" (thereby meaning a mere  league of States) but \"a strong consolidated union.\" Upon this radical  change the convention was to argue earnestly and at times bitterly for  many a weary day. The plan provided for a national legislature of which  the lower branch should be elected by the people and the upper branch by  the lower branch upon the nomination of the legislatures of the States.  This legislature should enjoy all the legislative rights given to the  federation, and there followed the sweeping grant that it \"could  legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent or  in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the  exercise of individual legislation,\" with power \"to negative all laws  passed by the several States contravening in the opinion of the national  legislature the Articles of the Union.\"    A national executive was proposed, together with a national judiciary,  and these two bodies were given authority \"to examine every act of the  national legislature before it shall operate and every act of a  particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final.\" This  marked an immense advance over the Articles of Confederation, under  which there was no national executive or judiciary, and under which the  legislature had no direct power over the citizens of the States, and  could only impose duties upon the States themselves by the concurrence  of nine of the thirteen.    Hardly had Mr. Randolph submitted the so-called Virginia plan when  Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, a young man of twenty-nine years  of age, with the courage of youth submitted to the House a draft of the  future federal government. Curiously enough, it did not differ in  principle from the Virginia plan, but was more specific and concrete in  stating the powers which the federal government should exercise, and  many of its provisions were embodied in the final draft. Indeed,  Pinckney's plan was the future Constitution of the United States in  embryo; and when it is read and contrasted with the document which has  so justly won the acclaim of men throughout the world, it is amazing  that so young a man should have anticipated and reduced to a concrete  and effective form many of the most novel features of the Federal  Government. As "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#8)"],[1," all, I need a fighter. Then I watched your eyes and your  hands. The first were direct and yet they were alert. And your hands  were perfectly steady.\"    \"Qualifications for a fighter, eh?\"    \"Do you wish further proof?\"    \"Well?\"    \"What of the fight to the death which you went through this same night?\"    Donnegan started. It was a small movement, that flinching, and he  covered it by continuing the upward gesture of his hand to his coat; he  drew out tobacco and cigarette papers and commenced to roll his smoke.  Looking up, he saw that the eyes of Colonel Macon were smiling, although  his face was grave.    A glint of understanding passed between the two men, but not a spoken  word.    \"I assure you, there was no death tonight,\" said Donnegan at length.    \"Tush! Of course not! But the tear on the shoulder of your coat--ah,  that is too smooth edged for a tear, too long for the bite of a  scissors. Am I right? Tush! Not a word!\"    The colonel beamed with an almost tender pride, and Donnegan, knowing  that the fat man looked upon him as a murderer, newly come from a  death, considered the beaming face and thought many things in silence.    \"So it was easy to see that in coolness, courage, fighting instinct,  skill, you were probably what I want. Yet something more than all these  qualifications is necessary for the task which lies ahead of you.\"    \"You pile up the bad features, eh?\"    \"To entice you, Donnegan. For one man, paint a rosy beginning, and once  under way he will manage the hard parts. For you, show you the hard  shell and you will trust it contains the choice flesh. I was saying,  that I waited to see other qualities in you; qualities of the judgment.  And suddenly you flashed upon me a single glance; I felt it clash  against my willpower. I felt your look go past my guard like a rapier  slipping around my blade. I, Colonel Macon, was for the first time  outfaced, out-maneuvered. I admit it, for I rejoice in meeting such a  man. And the next instant you told me that I should keep you here out of  my own wish! Admirable!\"    The admiration of the colonel, indeed, almost overwhelmed Donnegan, but  he saw that in spite of the genial smile, the face suffused with warmth,  the colonel was watching him every instant, flinty-eyed. Donnegan did as  he had done on the stairs; he burst into laughter.    When he had done, the colonel was leaning forward in his chair with his  fingers interlacing, examining his guest from beneath somber brows. As  he sat lurched forward he gave a terrible impression of that reserved  energy which Donnegan had sensed before.    \"Donnegan,\" said the colonel, \"I shall talk no more nonsense to you. You  are a terrible fellow!\"    And Donnegan knew that, for the first time in the colonel's life, he was  meeting another man upon equal ground.          9      In a way, it was an awful tribute, for one great fact grew upon him:  that the colonel represented almost perfectly the power of absolute  evil. Donnegan was not a squeamish sort, but the fat, smiling face of  Macon filled him with unutterable aversion. A dozen times he would have  left the room, but a silken thread held him back, the thought of Lou.    \"I shall be terse and entirely frank,\" said the colonel, and at once  Donnegan reared triple guard and balanced himself for attack or defense.    \"Between you and me,\" went on the fat man, \"deceptive words are folly. A  waste of energy.\" He flushed a little. \"You are, I believe, the first  man who has ever laughed at me.\" The click of his teeth as he snapped  them on this sentence seemed to promise that he should also be the last.    \"So I tear away the veils which made me ridiculous, I grant you.  Donnegan, we have met each other just in time.\"    \"True,\" said Donnegan, \"you have a task for me that promises a lot of  fighting; and in return I get lodgings for the night.\"    \"Wrong, wrong! I offer you much more. I offer you a career of action in  which you may forget the great sorrow which has fallen upon you: and in  the battles which lie before you, you will find oblivion for the sad  past which lies behind you.\"    Here Donnegan sprang to his feet with his hand caught at his breast; and  he stood quivering, in an agony. Pain worked him as anger would do, and,  his slender frame swelling, his muscles taut, he stood like a panther  enduring the torture because knows it is folly to attempt to escape.    \"You are a human devil!\" Donnegan said at last, and sank back upon his  stool. For a moment he was overcome, his head falling upon his breast,  and even when he looked up his face was terribly pale, and his eyes  dull. His expression, however, cleared swiftly, and aside from the  perspiration which shone on his forehead it would have been impossible  ten seconds later to discover that the blow of the colonel had fallen  upon him.    All of this the colonel had observed and noted with grim satisfaction.  Not once did he speak until he saw that all was well.    \"I am sorry,\" he said at length in a voice almost as delicate as the  voice of Lou Macon. \"I am sorry, but you forced me to say more than I  wished to say.\"    Donnegan brushed the apology aside.    His voice became low and hurried. \"Let us get on in the matter. I am  eager to learn from you, colonel.\"    \"Very well. Since it seems that there is a place for both our interests  in this matter, I shall run on in my tale and make it, as I promised you  before, absolutely frank and curt. I shall not descend into small  details. I shall give you a main sketch of the high points; for all men  of mind are apt to be confused by the face of a thing, whereas the heart  of it is perfectly clear to them.\"    He settled into his narrative.    \"You have heard of The Corner? No? Well, that is not strange; but a few  weeks ago gold was found in the sands where the valleys of Young Muddy  and Christobel Rivers join. The Corner is a long, wide triangle of sand,  and the sand is filled with a gold deposit brought down from the  headwaters of both rivers and precipitated here, where one current meets  the other and reduces the resultant stream to sluggishness. The sands  are rich--very rich!\"    He had become a trifle flushed as he talked, and now, perhaps to cover  his emotion, he carefully selected a cigarette from the humidor beside  him and lighted it without haste before he spoke another word.    \"Long ago I prospected over that valley; a few weeks ago it was brought  to my attention again. I determined to stake some claims and work them.  But I could not go myself. I had to send a trustworthy man. Whom should  I select? There was only one possible. Jack Landis is my ward. A dozen  years ago his parents died and they sent him to my care, for my fortune  was then comfortable. I raised him with as much tenderness as I could  have shown my own son; I lavished on him the affection and--\"    Here Donnegan coughed lightly; the fat man paused, and observing that  this hypocrisy did not draw the veil over the bright eyes of his guest,  he continued: \"In a word, I made him one of my family. And when the need  for a man came I turned to him. He is young, strong, active, able to  take care of himself.\"    At this Donnegan pricked his ears.    \"He went, accordingly, to The Corner and staked the claims and filed  them as I directed. I was right. There was gold. Much gold. It panned  out in nuggets.\"    He made an indescribable gesture, and through his strong fingers  Donnegan had a vision of yellow gold pouring.    \"But there is seldom a discovery of importance claimed by one man alone.  This was no exception. A villain named William Lester, known as a  scoundrel over the length and breadth of the cattle country, claimed  that he had made the discovery first. He even went so far as to claim  that I had obtained my information from him and he tried to jump the  claims staked by Jack Landis, whereupon Jack, very properly, shot Lester  down. Not dead, unfortunately, but slightly wounded.    \"In the meantime the rush for The Corner started. In a week there was a  village; in a fortnight there was a town; in a month The Corner had  become the talk of the ranges. Jack Landis found in the claims a mint.  He sent me back a mere souvenir.\"    The fat man produced from his vest pocket a little chunk of yellow and  with a dexterous motion whipped it at Donnegan. It was done so suddenly,  so unexpectedly that the wanderer was well-nigh taken by surprise. But  his hand flashed up and caught the metal before it struck his face. He  found in the palm of his hand a nugget weighing perhaps five ounces,  and he flicked it back to the colonel.    \"He sent me the souvenir, but that was all. Since that time I have  waited. Nothing has come. I sent for word, and I learned that Jack  Landis had betrayed his trust, fallen in love with some undesirable  woman of the mining camp, denied my claim to any of the gold to which I  had sent him. Unpleasant news? Yes. Ungrateful boy? Yes. But my mind is  hardened against adversity.    \"Yet this blow struck me close to the heart. Because Landis is engaged  to marry my daughter, Lou. At first I could hardly believe in his  disaffection. But the truth has at length been borne home to me. The  scoundrel has abandoned both Lou and me!\"    Donnegan repeated slowly: \"Your daughter loves this chap?\"    The colonel allowed his glance to narrow, and he could do this the more  safely because at this moment Donnegan's eyes were wandering into the  distance. In that unguarded second Donnegan was defenseless and the  colonel read something that set him beaming.    \"She loves him, of course,\" he said, \"and he is breaking her heart with  his selfishness.\"    \"He is breaking her heart?\" echoed Donnegan.    The colonel raised his hand and stroked his enormous chin. Decidedly he  believed that things were getting on very well.    \"This is the position,\" he declared. \"Jack Landis was threatened by the  wretch Lester, and shot him down. But"]]]
