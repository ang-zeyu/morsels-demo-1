Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#7)"],[1,"y, is the term used to distinguish the  old of domestic fowls from chickens or pullets. In fricasseeing, the  meat to be cooked is cut into pieces and sauted either before or after  stewing; then it is served with a white or a brown sauce. Ordinarily,  the meat should be browned first, unless it is very tough, in order to  retain the juices and improve the flavor. However, very old fowl or  tough meat should be stewed first and then browned.           *       *       *       *       *    HEAT FOR COOKING    GENERAL DISCUSSION    47. Inasmuch as heat is so important a factor in the cooking of foods,  it is absolutely necessary that the person who is to prepare them be  thoroughly familiar with the ways in which this heat is produced. The  production of heat for cooking involves the use of fuels and stoves in  which to burn them, as well as electricity, which serves the purpose of  a fuel, and apparatus for using electricity. In order, therefore, that  the best results may be obtained in cookery, these subjects are here  taken up in detail.    48. Probably the first fuel to be used in the production of heat for  cooking was wood, but later such fuels as peat, coal, charcoal, coke,  and kerosene came into use. Of these fuels, coal, gas, and kerosene are  used to the greatest extent in the United States. Wood, of course, is  used considerably for kindling fires, and it serves as fuel in  localities where it is abundant or less difficult to procure than other  fuels. However, it is fast becoming too scarce and too expensive to  burn. If it must be burned for cooking purposes, those who use it should  remember that dry, hard wood gives off heat at a more even rate than  soft wood, which is usually selected for kindling. Electricity is coming  into favor for supplying heat for cooking, but only when it can be sold  as cheaply as gas will its use in the home become general.    49. The selection of a stove to be used for cooking depends on the fuel  that is to be used, and the fuel, in turn, depends on the locality in  which a person lives. However, as the fuel that is the most convenient  and easily obtained is usually the cheapest, it is the one to be  selected, for the cost of the cooked dish may be greatly increased by  the use of fuel that is too expensive. In cooking, every fuel should be  made to do its maximum amount of work, because waste of fuel also adds  materially to the cost of cooking and, besides, it often causes great  inconvenience. For example, cooking on a red-hot stove with a fire that,  instead of being held in the oven and the lids, overheats the kitchen  and burns out the stove not only wastes fuel and material, but also  taxes the temper of the person who is doing the work. From what has just  been said, it will readily be seen that a knowledge of fuels and  apparatus for producing heat will assist materially in the economical  production of food, provided, of course, it is applied to the best  advantage.      COAL AND COKE    50. VARIETIES OF COAL.--Possibly the most common fuel used for cooking  is coal. This fuel comes in two varieties, namely, _anthracite_, or  _hard coal_, and _bituminous_, or _soft coal_. Their relative cost  depends on the locality, the kind of stove, and an intelligent use of  both stove and fuel. Hard coal costs much more in some places than soft  coal, but it burns more slowly and evenly and gives off very little  smoke. Soft coal heats more rapidly than hard coal, but it produces  considerable smoke and makes a fire that does not last so long. Unless a  stove is especially constructed for soft coal, it should not be used for  this purpose, because the burning of soft coal will wear it out in a  short time. The best plan is to use each variety of coal in a stove  especially constructed for it, but if a housewife finds that she must at  times do otherwise, she should realize that a different method of  management and care of the stove is demanded.    51. SIZES OF COAL.--As the effect of coal on the stove must be taken  into consideration in the buying of fuel, so the different sizes of hard  coal must be known before the right kind can be selected. The sizes  known as _stove_ and _egg coal_, which range from about 1-3/8 to 2-3/4  inches in diameter, are intended for a furnace and should not be used in  the kitchen stove for cooking purposes. Some persons who know how to  use the size of coal known as _pea_, which is about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in  diameter, like that kind, whereas others prefer the size called  _chestnut_, which is about 3/4 inch to 1-3/8 inches in diameter. In  reality, a mixture of these two, if properly used, makes the best and  most easily regulated kitchen coal fire.    52. QUALITY OF COAL.--In addition to knowing the names, prices, and uses  of the different kinds of coal, the housewife should be able to  distinguish poor coal from good coal. In fact, proper care should be  exercised in all purchasing, for the person who understands the quality  of the thing to be purchased will be more likely to get full value for  the money paid than the one who does not. About coal, it should be  understood that good hard coal has a glossy black color and a bright  surface, whereas poor coal contains slaty pieces. The quality of coal  can also be determined from the ash that remains after it is burned.  Large chunks or great quantities of ash indicate a poor quality of coal,  and fine, powdery ash a good quality. Of course, even if the coal is of  the right kind, poor results are often brought about by the bad  management of a fire, whether in a furnace or a stove. Large  manufacturing companies, whose business depends considerably on the  proper kind of fuel, buy coal by the heat units--that is, according to  the quantity of heat it will give off--and at some future time this plan  may have to be followed in the private home, unless some other fuel is  provided in the meantime.    Mixed with poor coal are certain unburnable materials that melt and  stick together as it burns and form what are known as _clinkers_.  Clinkers are very troublesome because they often adhere to the stove  grate or the lining of the firebox. They generally form during the  burning of an extremely hot fire, but the usual temperature of a kitchen  fire does not produce clinkers unless the coal is of a very poor  quality. Mixing oyster shells with coal of this kind often helps to  prevent their formation.    53. COKE.--Another fuel that is sometimes used for cooking is coke.  Formerly, coke was a by-product in the manufacture of illuminating gas,  but now it is manufactured from coal for use as a fuel. Because of the  nature of its composition, coke produces a very hot fire and is  therefore favorable for rapid cooking, such as broiling. However, it is  used more extensively in hotels and institutions than in kitchens where  cooking is done on a small scale.      GAS    54. VALUE OF GAS AS FUEL.--As a fuel for cooking purposes, gas, both  _artificial_ and _natural_, is very effective, and in localities where  the piping of gas into homes is possible it is used extensively. Of the  two kinds, artificial gas produces the least heat; also, it is the most  expensive, usually costing two or three times as much as natural gas.  Both are very cheap, however, considering their convenience as a kitchen  fuel. Heat from gas is obtained by merely turning it on and igniting it,  as with a lighted match. Its consumption can be stopped at once by  closing off the supply, or it can be regulated as desired and in this  way made to give the exact amount of heat required for the method of  cookery adopted. Neither smoke nor soot is produced in burning gas if  the burners of the gas stove are adjusted to admit the right amount of  air, and no ashes nor refuse remain to be disposed of after gas has been  burned. Because gas is so easily handled, good results can be obtained  by those who have had very little experience in using it, and with study  and practice results become uniform and gas proves to be an  economical fuel.    55. MEASUREMENT OF GAS.--Gas is measured by the cubic foot, and a  definite price is charged for each 1,000 cubic feet. To determine the  quantity used, it is passed through what is called a meter, which  measures as the gas burns. It is important that each housewife be able  to read the amount registered by the meter, so that she can compare her  gas bill with the meter reading and thus determine whether the charges  are correct. If only the usual amount of gas has been consumed and the  bill does not seem to be correct or is much larger than it has been  previously, the matter should be reported to the proper authorities, for  the meter may be out of order and in need of repair.    [Illustration: Fig. 1 Gas Meter Dials]    56. READING A GAS METER.--To register the quantity of gas that is  consumed, a gas meter, as is shown in Fig. 1, is provided with three  large dials, each of which has ten spaces over which the hand, or  indicator, passes to indicate the amount of gas consumed, and with one  small dial, around which the hand makes one revolution every time 2  cubic feet of gas is consumed. This small dial serves to tell whether  gas is leaking when the stoves and lights are not turned on. Above each  large dial is an arrow that points out the direction in which to read,  the two outside ones reading toward the right and the center one toward  the left; also, above each dial is lettered the quantity of gas that  each dial registers, that at the right registering 1,000 cubic feet,  that in the center 10,000 cubic feet, and that at the left 100,000 cubic  feet. To read the dials, begin at the left, or the 100,000 dial, and  read toward the right. In each instance, read the number over which the  hand has passed last. For instance, when, as in Fig. 1, the hand lies  between 5 and 6 on the left dial, 5 is read; on the center dial, when  the hand lies between 5 and 6, 5 is read also; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#7)"],[1,"otatoes, which are difficult to use in ordinary ways,  they may be cooked with the skins on and peeled to be used for salad  when they have cooled. A boiled salad dressing is perhaps the most  desirable for such a salad.    POTATO SALAD No. 1  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    2 c. diced potatoes  Salt  1 medium-sized onion  Boiled salad dressing  1/2 tsp. celery seed  Lettuce  1 Tb. parsley, chopped  1 hard-cooked egg    Dice the potatoes into 1/2-inch dice, chop the onion fine, and mix the  two. Add the celery seed and parsley and season the whole with salt.  Just before serving, mix well with boiled dressing. Garnish a salad bowl  or salad plates with lettuce, place the salad on the lettuce, and then  garnish with slices of hard-cooked egg.    64. POTATO SALAD NO. 2.--The salad given in the accompanying recipe is  perhaps more of a combination of vegetables than it is a potato salad.  However, if there is in supply a small amount of celery, or perhaps a  cucumber, or both, this is an excellent way in which to make use of  them. In addition to the ingredients given in the recipe, others may be  added to this salad, such as a few diced radishes, a diced green pepper  or two, or a pimiento.    POTATO SALAD No. 2  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 1/2 c. diced potatoes  Salt  1/2 c. diced cucumber  Boiled salad dressing  1/2 c. diced celery  Lettuce  1 medium-sized onion    Prepare the vegetables in the usual way, dicing them carefully, and just  before serving mix them together, season well with salt, and add the  salad dressing. Boiled dressing is preferable. Place in a salad bowl or  on salad plates garnished with lettuce.    65. OLD-FASHIONED POTATO SALAD.--The potato salad given in this recipe  is agreeable to persons who like the flavor of smoked meat. It is an  excellent salad to serve for a lunch or a supper with cold ham,  frankfurters, or any cold sliced meat.    OLD-FASHIONED POTATO SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    2 c. sliced boiled potatoes  1/4 c. water  2 thin slices bacon  Salt  1 Tb. flour  Pepper  1/2 c. vinegar  2 Tb. parsley, chopped    Slice cold boiled potatoes into medium thick slices. Cut the strips of  bacon into small cubes and fry until crisp in a frying pan. Stir the  flour into the hot fat, and to this add the vinegar and water. Season  this dressing well with salt and pepper and pour it hot over the  potatoes, mixing carefully so as not to break the slices. Add the  chopped parsley last. Serve warm if desired, or allow it to cool  before serving.    66. TOMATO-AND-STRING BEAN SALAD.--Besides being appetizing in flavor  and appearance, tomato-and-string-bean salad, which is illustrated in  Fig. 8, has the advantage over some salads in that it can be made of  either fresh or canned vegetables. For the salad here shown, tomatoes  and beans canned by the cold-pack method were used. If it is desired to  duplicate this salad, place a canned tomato or a peeled fresh tomato in  the center of a plate garnished with lettuce and around it place several  piles of three or four canned or freshly cooked beans. Serve with French  dressing or any other desired salad dressing.    [Illustration: FIG. 8]    67. STRING-BEAN SALAD.--Either string or wax beans may be used for  string-bean salad, which is shown in Fig. 9, and they may be cooked  freshly for the purpose or be home canned or commercially canned beans.  To make this salad, place a neat pile of beans on a lettuce leaf resting  on a plate and moisten with a few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. Serve  with mayonnaise or cooked salad dressing. If desired, the beans may be  cut into inch lengths and mixed with the dressing, but this does not  make so attractive a salad.    68. GREEN-VEGETABLE SALAD.--There are a number of green vegetables that  are much used for salad either alone or with other vegetables. All of  them are used in practically the same way, but a point that should not  be overlooked if an appetizing salad is desired is that they should  always be fresh and crisp when served. Any salad dressing that is  preferred may be served with them. Chief among these green vegetables  come lettuce, including the ordinary leaf lettuce, head lettuce, and  romaine lettuce, which is not so common as the other varieties. Several  kinds of endive as well as watercress may also be used for salad.    [Illustration: FIG. 9]      COMBINATION FRUIT-AND-VEGETABLE SALADS    69. Sometimes it is desired to make a salad that contains both fruits  and vegetables. Various fruits can be used for this purpose, but celery,  as has been stated, is about the only vegetable that combines well with  fruit, unless, of course, the garnish, which is nearly always a  vegetable, is considered a part of the salad. Recipes for several very  appetizing salads containing both vegetables and fruits follow.    70. APPLE-AND-CELERY SALAD.--If an excellent winter salad is desired,  apple-and-celery salad should be selected, for both celery and apples  are best during the winter months. As they are very similar in color,  they are not especially appetizing in appearance when combined for a  salad, but they make a very popular combination with most persons.    APPLE-AND-CELERY SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 c. diced apples  Boiled salad dressing  1 c. diced celery  Lettuce    Prepare the apples and celery as short a time before serving as  possible, but if it is necessary that the apples stand for any length of  time, sprinkle them with a little lemon juice and water to keep them  from turning brown. Just before serving, mix them with the salad  dressing. Place on salad plates garnished with lettuce and serve.    71. WALDORF SALAD.--If to the apple-and-celery salad just explained 1/2  cupful of chopped English walnut meats is added, what is known as  Waldorf salad will result. The nuts, which should be added to the  mixture just before placing it on the table, may be mixed with the other  ingredients or they may be placed on top. Nuts that are to be used for  such a purpose should not be run through a grinder, but should be cut  with a knife or chopped with a chopping knife and bowl.    72. GRAPEFRUIT-AND-CELERY SALAD.--Celery is sometimes used with  grapefruit to make a salad. This combination is most often served with  French dressing, but any other desirable dressing may be used as well.  Prepare the grapefruit in the same way as oranges are prepared for  salad, and cut each section into three or four pieces. Add to this an  equal amount of diced celery and serve on a lettuce leaf with any  desired dressing.      FRUIT SALADS    73. Salads made of fruit are undoubtedly the most delicious that can be  prepared. In addition to being delightful in both appearance and flavor,  they afford another means of introducing fruit into the diet. As fruit  is decidedly beneficial for all persons with a normal digestion, every  opportunity to include it in the diet should be grasped.    Some fruit salads are comparatively bland in flavor while others are  much more acid, but the mild ones are neither so appetizing nor so  beneficial as those which are somewhat tart. Advantage should be taken  of the various kinds of fresh fruits during the seasons when they can be  obtained, for usually very appetizing salads can be made of them.  However, the family need not be deprived of fruit salads during the  winter when fresh fruits cannot be secured, for delicious salads can be  made from canned and dried fruits, as well as from bananas and citrus  fruits, which are usually found in all markets.    74. FRUIT-SALAD DRESSING.--Various dressings may be served with fruit  salad, and usually the one selected depends on the preference of those  to whom it is served. However, an excellent dressing for salad of this  kind and one that most persons find delicious is made from fruit juices  thickened by means of eggs. Whenever a recipe in this Section calls for  a fruit-salad dressing, this is the one that is intended.    FRUIT-SALAD DRESSING    1/2 c. pineapple, peach, or pear juice  1/2 c. orange juice  1/4 c. lemon juice  1/4 c. sugar  2 eggs    Mix the fruit juices, add the sugar, beat the eggs slightly, and add  them. Put the whole into a double boiler and cook until the mixture  begins to thicken. Remove from the fire and beat for a few seconds with  a rotary egg beater. Cool and serve.    75. COMBINATION FRUIT SALAD.--The combination of fruits given in the  accompanying recipe makes a very good salad, but it need not be adhered  to strictly. If one or more of the fruits is not in supply, it may be  omitted and some other used. In case canned pineapple is used for the  salad, the juice from the fruit may be utilized in making a  fruit-salad dressing.    COMBINATION FRUIT SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 grapefruit  2 oranges  1 banana  2 apples  2 slices pineapple  Salad dressing  Lettuce    Prepare the grapefruit and oranges according to the directions  previously given. Slice the banana crosswise into 1/4-inch slices and  cut each slice into four sections. Dice the apples and cut the pineapple  in narrow wedge-shaped pieces. Mix the fruit just before serving. Add  the salad dressing, which may be fruit-salad dressing, French dressing,  or some other desirable salad dressing, by mixing it with the fruit or  merely pouring it over the top. Serve on salad plates garnished with  lettuce leaves. Place a maraschino cherry on top.    76. SUMMER COMBINATION SALAD.--Any agreeable combination of fruits which  may be obtained during the same season will be suitable for summer  combination salad. The combination given in the accompanying recipe  includes strawberries, pineapple, and cherries. However, pineapple and  cherries may be used alone, or strawberries and pineapple may be used  without the cherries, or red raspberries may be used to garnish such  a salad.    SUMMER COMBINATION SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    3/4 c. strawberries, cut into halves  3/4 c. pineapple, cut into dice  3/4 c. sweet"]]]
