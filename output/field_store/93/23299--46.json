And  you can go as far as you like.\" He put out his jaw in an ugly way as  he said it.    \"It would be worth a lot to me to have this cur done for, Bill. You  understand?\"    \"My time's short. Talk terms, Charlie.\"    \"A thousand.\"    \"The price of a fair hoss.\"    \"Two thousand, old man.\"    \"Hoss and trimmin's.\"    \"Three thousand.\" \"Charlie, you seem to forget that we're talkin' about  a man and a gun.\"    \"Bill, it's worth five thousand to me.\"    \"That's turkey. Let me have your hand.\"    They shook hands.    \"And if you kill the horses,\" said Charles Merchant, \"you won't hurt my  feelings. But get him!\"    \"I've got nothing much on him,\" said Bill Dozier, \"but some fools resist  arrest.\"    He smiled in a manner that made the other shudder. And a moment later  the deputy led his men out on the trail.    They were a weary lot by this time, but they had beneath the belt  several shots of the Merchant whisky which Charles had distributed. And  they had that still greater stimulus--fresh horses running smooth and  strong beneath them. Another thing had changed. They saw their leader,  Bill Dozier, working at his revolver and his rifle as he rode, looking  to the charges, trying the pressure of the triggers, getting the balance  of the weapons with a peculiar anxiety, and they knew, without a word  being spoken, that there was small chance of that trail ending at  anything short of a red mark in the dust.    It made some of them shrug their shoulders, but here again it was proved  that Bill Dozier knew the men of Martindale, and had picked his posse  well. They were the common, hard-working variety of cow-puncher, and  presently the word went among them from the man riding nearest to Bill  that if young Lanning were taken it would be worth a hundred dollars to  each of them. Two months' pay for two days' work. That was fair enough.  They also began to look to their guns. It was not that a single one of  them could have been bought for a mankilling at that or any other price,  perhaps, but this was simply a bonus to carry them along toward what  they considered an honest duty.    Nevertheless, it was a different crew that rode over the hills away  from the Merchant place. They had begun for the sake of the excitement.  Now they were working carefully, riding with less abandon, jockeying  their horses, for each man was laboring to be in on the kill.    They had against them a good horse and a stanch horseman. Never had the  pinto dodged his share of honest running, and this day was no exception.  He gave himself whole-heartedly to his task, and he stretched the legs  of the ponies behind him. Yet he had a great handicap. He was tough, but  the ranch horses of John Merchant came out from a night of rest. Their  legs were full of running. And the pinto, for all his courage, could not  meet that handicap and beat it.    That truth slowly sank in upon the mind of the fugitive as he put the  game little cattle pony into his best stride. He tried the pinto in the  level going. He tried him in the rough. And in both conditions the posse  gained slowly and steadily, until it became apparent to Andrew Lanning  that the deputy held him in the hollow of his hand, and in half an hour  of stiff galloping could run his quarry into the ground whenever  he chose.    Andy turned in the saddle and grinned back at the followers. He could  distinguish Bill Dozier most distinctly. The broad brim of Bill's hat  was blown up stiffly. And the sun glinted now and again on those  melancholy mustaches of his. Andy was puzzled. Bill had horses which  could outrun the fugitive, and why did he not use them?    Almost at once Andy received his answer.    The deputy sheriff sent his horse into a hard run, and then brought him  suddenly to a standstill. Looking back, Andy saw a rifle pitch to the  shoulder of the deputy. It was a flashing line of light which focused  suddenly in a single, glinting dot. That instant something hummed evilly  beside the ear of Andy. A moment later the report came barking and  echoing in his ear with the little metallic ring in it which tells of  the shiver of a gun barrel.    That was the beginning of a running fusillade. Technically these were  shots fired to warn the fugitive that he was wanted by the law, and to  tell him that if he did not halt he would be shot at to be killed. But  the deputy did not waste warnings. He began to shoot to kill. And so did  the rest of the posse. They saw the deputy's plan at once, and then  grinned at it. If they rode down in a mob the boy would no doubt  surrender. But if they goaded him in this manner from a distance he  would probably attempt to return the fire. And if he fired one shot in  reply, unwritten law and strong public opinion would be on the side of  Bill Dozier in killing this criminal without quarter. In a word, the  whisky and the little promise of money were each taking effect on  the posse.    They spurted ahead in pairs, halted, and delivered their fire; then the  next pair spurted ahead and fired. Every moment or so two bullets winged  through the air nearer and nearer Andy. It was really a wonder that he  was not cleanly drilled by a bullet long before that fusillade had  continued for ten minutes. But it is no easy thing to hit a man on a  galloping horse when one sits on the back of another horse, and that  horse heaving from a hard run. Moreover, Andy watched, and when the  pairs halted he made the pinto weave.    At the first bullet he felt his heart come into his throat. At the  second he merely raised his head. At the next he smiled, and thereafter  he greeted each volley with a yell and with a wave of his hat. It was  like dancing, but greater fun. The cold, still terror was in his heart  every moment, but yet he felt like laughing, and when the posse heard  him their own hearts went cold.    It disturbed their aim. They began to snarl at each other, and they also  pressed their horses closer and closer before they even attempted to  fire. And the result was that Andy, waving his hat, felt it twitch  sharply in his hand, and then he saw a neat little hole clipped out of  the very edge of the brim. It was a pretty trick to see, until Andy  remembered that the thing which had nicked that hole would also cut its  way through him, body and bone. He leaned over the saddle and spurred  the pinto into his racing gait.    \"I nicked him!\" yelled the deputy. \"Come on, boys! Close in!\"    But within five minutes of racing, Andy drew the pinto to a sudden halt  and raised his rifle. The posse laughed. They had been shooting for some  time, and always for a distance even less than Andy's; yet not one of  their bullets had gone home. So they waved their hats recklessly and  continued to ride to be in at the death. And every one knew that the end  of the trail was not far off when the fugitive had once begun to turn  at bay.    Andy knew it as well as the rest, and his hand shook like a nervous  girl's, while the rifle barrel tilted up and up, the blue barrel  shimmering wickedly. In a frenzy of eagerness he tried to line up the  sights. It was in vain. The circle through which he squinted wobbled  crazily. He saw two of the pursuers spurt ahead, take their posts, raise  their rifles for a fire which would at least disturb his. For the first  time they had a stationary target.    And then, by chance, the circle of Andy's sight embraced the body of a  horseman. Instantly the left arm, stretching out to support his rifle,  became a rock; the forefinger of his right hand was as steady as the  trigger it pressed. It was like shooting at a target. He found himself  breathing easily.    It was very strange. Find a man with his sights? He could follow his  target as though a magnetic power attracted his rifle. The weapon seemed  to have a volition of its own. It drifted along with the canter of Bill  Dozier. With incredible precision the little finger of iron inside the  circle dwelt in turn on the hat of Bill Dozier, on his sandy mustaches,  on his fluttering shirt. And Andy knew that he had the life of a man  under the command of his forefinger.    And why not? He had killed one. Why not a hundred?    The punishment would be no greater. And to tempt him there was this new  mystery, this knowledge that he could not miss. It had been vaguely  present in his mind when he faced the crowd at Martindale, he remembered  now. And the same merciless coldness had been in his hand when he  pressed his gun into the throat of Charles Merchant.    He turned his eyes and looked down the guns of the two men who had  halted. Then, hardly looking at his target, he snapped his rifle back to  his shoulder and fired. He saw Bill Dozier throw up his hands, saw his  head rock stupidly back and forth, and then the long figure toppled to  one side. One of the posse rushed alongside to catch his leader, but he  missed, and Bill, slumping to the ground, was trampled underfoot.          CHAPTER 9      At the same time the rifles of the two men of the posse rang, but they  must have seen the fall of their leader, for the shots went wild, and  Andy Lanning took off his hat and waved to them. But he did not flee  again. He sat in his saddle with the long rifle balanced across the  pommel while two thoughts went through his mind. One was to stay there  and watch. The other was to slip the rifle back into the holster and  with drawn revolver charge the five remaining members of the posse.  These were now gathering hastily about Bill Dozier. But Andy knew their  concern was in vain. He knew where that bullet had driven home, and Bill  Dozier would never ride again.    One by one he picked up those five figures with his eyes, fighting  temptation. He knew that he could not miss if he fired again. In five  shots he knew that he could drop as many men, and within him there was a  perfect consciousness that they would not hit him when they returned  the fire.

Scythrop immediately replaced Dante on the shelf, and joined the  circle round the beautiful singer. Marionetta gave him a smile of  approbation that fully restored his complacency, and they continued  on the best possible terms during the remainder of the evening. The  Honourable Mr Listless turned over the leaves with double alacrity,  saying, 'You are severe upon invalids, Miss O'Carroll: to escape your  satire, I must try to be sprightly, though the exertion is too much  for me.'           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VII      A new visitor arrived at the Abbey, in the person of Mr Asterias,  the ichthyologist. This gentleman had passed his life in seeking the  living wonders of the deep through the four quarters of the world;  he had a cabinet of stuffed and dried fishes, of shells, sea-weeds,  corals, and madrepores, that was the admiration and envy of the Royal  Society. He had penetrated into the watery den of the Sepia Octopus,  disturbed the conjugal happiness of that turtle-dove of the ocean, and  come off victorious in a sanguinary conflict. He had been becalmed  in the tropical seas, and had watched, in eager expectation, though  unhappily always in vain, to see the colossal polypus rise from the  water, and entwine its enormous arms round the masts and the rigging.  He maintained the origin of all things from water, and insisted that  the polypodes were the first of animated things, and that, from their  round bodies and many-shooting arms, the Hindoos had taken their gods,  the most ancient of deities. But the chief object of his ambition, the  end and aim of his researches, was to discover a triton and a mermaid,  the existence of which he most potently and implicitly believed, and  was prepared to demonstrate, _a priori, a posteriori, a fortiori_,  synthetically and analytically, syllogistically and inductively,  by arguments deduced both from acknowledged facts and plausible  hypotheses. A report that a mermaid had been seen 'sleeking her soft  alluring locks' on the sea-coast of Lincolnshire, had brought him in  great haste from London, to pay a long-promised and often-postponed  visit to his old acquaintance, Mr Glowry.    Mr Asterias was accompanied by his son, to whom he had given the name  of Aquarius--flattering himself that he would, in the process of time,  become a constellation among the stars of ichthyological science. What  charitable female had lent him the mould in which this son was cast,  no one pretended to know; and, as he never dropped the most distant  allusion to Aquarius's mother, some of the wags of London maintained  that he had received the favours of a mermaid, and that the scientific  perquisitions which kept him always prowling about the sea-shore, were  directed by the less philosophical motive of regaining his lost love.    Mr Asterias perlustrated the sea-coast for several days, and reaped  disappointment, but not despair. One night, shortly after his arrival,  he was sitting in one of the windows of the library, looking towards  the sea, when his attention was attracted by a figure which was moving  near the edge of the surf, and which was dimly visible through the  moonless summer night. Its motions were irregular, like those of a  person in a state of indecision. It had extremely long hair, which  floated in the wind. Whatever else it might be, it certainly was not a  fisherman. It might be a lady; but it was neither Mrs Hilary nor Miss  O'Carroll, for they were both in the library. It might be one of the  female servants; but it had too much grace, and too striking an air of  habitual liberty, to render it probable. Besides, what should one of  the female servants be doing there at this hour, moving to and fro,  as it seemed, without any visible purpose? It could scarcely be a  stranger; for Claydyke, the nearest village, was ten miles distant;  and what female would come ten miles across the fens, for no purpose  but to hover over the surf under the walls of Nightmare Abbey? Might  it not be a mermaid? It was possibly a mermaid. It was probably a  mermaid. It was very probably a mermaid. Nay, what else could it be  but a mermaid? It certainly was a mermaid. Mr Asterias stole out of  the library on tiptoe, with his finger on his lips, having beckoned  Aquarius to follow him.    The rest of the party was in great surprise at Mr Asterias's movement,  and some of them approached the window to see if the locality would  tend to elucidate the mystery. Presently they saw him and Aquarius  cautiously stealing along on the other side of the moat, but they saw  nothing more; and Mr Asterias returning, told them, with accents of  great disappointment, that he had had a glimpse of a mermaid, but she  had eluded him in the darkness, and was gone, he presumed, to sup with  some enamoured triton, in a submarine grotto.    'But, seriously, Mr Asterias,' said the Honourable Mr Listless, 'do  you positively believe there are such things as mermaids?'      MR ASTERIAS    Most assuredly; and tritons too.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    What! things that are half human and half fish?      MR ASTERIAS    Precisely. They are the oran-outangs of the sea. But I am persuaded  that there are also complete sea men, differing in no respect from us,  but that they are stupid, and covered with scales; for, though our  organisation seems to exclude us essentially from the class of  amphibious animals, yet anatomists well know that the _foramen ovale_  may remain open in an adult, and that respiration is, in that case,  not necessary to life: and how can it be otherwise explained that the  Indian divers, employed in the pearl fishery, pass whole hours under  the water; and that the famous Swedish gardener of Troningholm lived  a day and a half under the ice without being drowned? A nereid, or  mermaid, was taken in the year 1403 in a Dutch lake, and was in every  respect like a French woman, except that she did not speak. Towards  the end of the seventeenth century, an English ship, a hundred and  fifty leagues from land, in the Greenland seas, discovered a flotilla  of sixty or seventy little skiffs, in each of which was a triton, or  sea man: at the approach of the English vessel the whole of them,  seized with simultaneous fear, disappeared, skiffs and all, under  the water, as if they had been a human variety of the nautilus. The  illustrious Don Feijoo has preserved an authentic and well-attested  story of a young Spaniard, named Francis de la Vega, who, bathing with  some of his friends in June, 1674, suddenly dived under the sea and  rose no more. His friends thought him drowned; they were plebeians and  pious Catholics; but a philosopher might very legitimately have drawn  the same conclusion.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Nothing could be more logical.      MR ASTERIAS    Five years afterwards, some fishermen near Cadiz found in their nets a  triton, or sea man; they spoke to him in several languages--      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    They were very learned fishermen.      MR HILARY    They had the gift of tongues by especial favour of their brother  fisherman, Saint Peter.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Is Saint Peter the tutelar saint of Cadiz?      (_None of the company could answer this question, and_ MR ASTERIAS  _proceeded_.)    They spoke to him in several languages, but he was as mute as a fish.  They handed him over to some holy friars, who exorcised him; but the  devil was mute too. After some days he pronounced the name Lierganes.  A monk took him to that village. His mother and brothers recognised  and embraced him; but he was as insensible to their caresses as any  other fish would have been. He had some scales on his body, which  dropped off by degrees; but his skin was as hard and rough as  shagreen. He stayed at home nine years, without recovering his  speech or his reason: he then disappeared again; and one of his old  acquaintance, some years after, saw him pop his head out of the water  near the coast of the Asturias. These facts were certified by his  brothers, and by Don Gaspardo de la Riba Aguero, Knight of Saint  James, who lived near Lierganes, and often had the pleasure of  our triton's company to dinner.--Pliny mentions an embassy of the  Olyssiponians to Tiberius, to give him intelligence of a triton which  had been heard playing on its shell in a certain cave; with several  other authenticated facts on the subject of tritons and nereids.
