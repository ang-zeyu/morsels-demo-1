The word for man was \"waepnedmenn\"  or weaponed person. A woman was \"wifmenn\" or wife person, with  \"wif\" being derived from the word for weaving.    Great men and monasteries had millers, smiths, carpenters,  architects, agriculturists, fishermen, weavers, embroiders, dyers,  and illuminators.    For entertainment, minstrels sang ballads about heroes or Bible  stories, harpers played, jesters joked, and tumblers threw and  caught balls and knives. There was gambling, dice games, and  chasing deer with hounds.    Fraternal guilds were established for mutual advantage and  protection. A guild imposed fines for any injury of one member by  another member. It assisted in paying any murder fine imposed on a  member. It avenged the murder of a member and abided by the  consequences. It buried its members and purchased masses for his  soul.    Mercantile guilds in seaports carried out commercial speculations  not possible by the capital of only one person.    There were some ale houses, probably part of certain dwellings.                                      - The Law -    Alfred issued a set of laws to cover the whole country, which were  drawn from the best laws of each region. There was no real  distinction between the concepts of law, morals, and religion.    The importance of telling the truth and keeping one's word are  expressed by this law: \"1. At the first we teach that it is most  needful that every man warily keep his oath and his wed. If any  one be constrained to either of these wrongfully, either to  treason against his lord, or to any unlawful aid; then it is  juster to belie than to fulfill. But if he pledge himself to that  which is lawful to fulfill, and in that belie himself, let him  submissively deliver up his weapon and his goods to the keeping of  his friends, and be in prison forty days in a King's tun: let him  there suffer whatever the bishop may prescribe to him...\" Let his  kinsmen feed him, if he has no food. If he escapes, let him be  held a fugitive and be excommunicate of the church.    The word of a bishop and of the king were incontrovertible without  an oath.    The Ten Commandments were written down as this law:    \"The Lord spake these words to Moses, and thus said: I am the Lord  thy God. I led thee out of the land of the Egyptians, and of their  bondage.    1.  Love thou not other strange gods above me.    2.  Utter thou not my name idly, for thou shalt not be guiltless      towards me if thou utter my name idly.    3.  Remember that thou hallow the rest day. Work for yourselves six      days, and on the seventh rest. For in six days, Christ wrought the      heavens and the earth, the seas, and all creatures that are in      them, and rested on the seventh day: and therefore the Lord      hallowed it.    4.  Honor thy father and thy mother whom the Lord hath given thee,      that thou mayst be the longer living on earth.    5.  Slay thou not.    6.  Commit thou not adultery.    7.  Steal thou not.    8.  Say thou not false witness.    9.  Covet thou not thy neighbor's goods unjustly.    10. Make thou not to thyself golden or silver gods.\"    If any one fights in the king's hall, or draws his weapon, and  he be taken; be it in the king's doom, either death, or life, as  he may be willing to grant him. If he escape, and be taken  again, let him pay for himself according to his wergeld, and  make bot for the offense, as well wer as wite, according as he  may have wrought.    If a man fights before a king's ealdorman in the gemot, let him  make bot with wer and wite as it may be right; and before this  120s. to the ealdorman as wite. If he disturbs the folkmote by  drawing his weapon, 120s. to the ealdorman as wite. If any of  this happens before a king's ealdorman's junior, or a king's  priest, 30s. as wite.    If any one fights in a ceorlish man's dwelling, let him make bot  of 6s. to the ceorl. If he draws his weapon but doesn't fight,  let it be half of that. If, however, either of these happens to  a man with a wergeld of 600s., let it increase threefold of the  ceorlish bot; and if to a man with a wergeld of 1200s., let it  increase twofold of the bot of the man with a wergeld of 600s.  Breach of the king's dwelling [breaking and entering] shall be  120s.; an archbishop's, 90s.; any other bishop's, and an  ealdorman's, 60s.;. a 1200s. wergeld man's, 30s.; a 600s.  wergeld man's, 15s.; and a ceorl's 5s.    If any one plot against the king's life, of himself, or by  harboring of exiles, or of his men; let him be liable with his  life and in all that he has; or let him prove himself according  to his lord's wer.    If any one with a band or gang of men slays an unoffending man,  let him who acknowledges the deathblow pay wer and wite. If the  slain man had a wergeld of 200s, let every one who was of the  gang pay 30s. as gangbot. If he had a wergeld of 600s., let  every one pay 60s. as gangbot. If he had a wergeld of 1200s.,  let every one pay 120s. If a gang does this, and afterwards  denies it on oath, let them all be accused, and let them then  all pay the wer in common; and all, one wite, such as shall  belong to the wer.    If any one lends his weapon to another so he may kill some one  with it, they may join together if they will in the wer. If they  will not join together, let him who lent the weapon pay of the  wer a third part, and of the wite a third part.    With his lord a man may fight free of liability for homicide, if  any one attack the lord: thus may the lord fight for his man.  Likewise, a man may fight with his born kinsman, if a man attack  him wrongfully, except against his lord. And a man may fight  free of liability for homicide, if he finds another with his  lawful wife, within closed doors, or under one covering, or with  his lawfully born daughter, or with his lawfully born sister, or  with his mother, who was given to his father as his lawful wife.  If a man knows his foe is sitting at his home, he may not fight  with him before he demands justice of him. If he has such power  that he can beset his foe, and besiege him within, let him keep  him within for seven days, and not attack him if he will remains  within. And, then, after seven days, if he surrenders, and gives  up his weapons, let him be kept safe for thirty days, and let  notice of him be given to his kinsmen and his friends. But if he  does not have sufficient power to besiege him within, let him  ride to the ealdorman, and beg aid of him. If he will not aid  him, let him ride to the king before he fights. In like manner  also, if a man come upon his foe, and he did not know  beforehand that he was staying at his home; if he is willing to  give up his weapons, let him be kept for thirty days, and let  notice of him be given to his friends; if he will not give up  his weapons, then he may attack him. If he is willing to  surrender, and to give up his weapons, and any one after that  attack him, let him pay as well wer as wound, as he may do, and  wite, and let him have forfeited his compensation to his kin.  Every church shall have this peace: if a fugitive flee to one  for sanctuary, no one may drag him out for seven days. If he is  willing to give up his weapons to his foes, let him stay thirty  days, and then let notice of him be given to his kinsmen. If any  man confess in church any offenses which had not been before  revealed, let him be half forgiven.    If a man from one holdgetael wishes to seek a lord in another  holdgetael, let him do it with the knowledge of the ealdorman  whom he before followed in his shire. If he does it without his  knowledge, let him who treats him as his man pay 120s. as wite,  one-half to the king in the shire where he before followed and  one-half in that into which he comes. If he has done anything  wrong where he was before, let him make bot for it who has there  received him as his man; and to the king 120s. as wite.    \"If any one steals so that his wife and children don't know it,  he shall pay 60 shillings as wite. But if he steals with the  knowledge of all his household, they shall all go into slavery.  A boy of ten years may be privy to a theft.\"    \"If one who takes a thief, or holds him for the person who took  him, lets the thief go, or conceals the theft, he shall pay for  the thief according to his wer. If he is an eorldormen, he shall  forfeit his shire, unless the king is willing to be merciful to  him.\"    If any one steal in a church, let him pay the lawful penalty and  the wite, and let the hand be struck off with which he did it.  If he will redeem the hand, and that be allowed him, let him pay  as may belong to his wer.    If a man slanders another, the penalty is no lighter thing than  that his tongue be cut out; which must not be redeemed at any  cheaper rate than it is estimated at according to his wer.    If one deceives an unbetrothed woman and sleep with her, he must  pay for her and have her afterwards to wife. But if her father not  approve, he should pay money according to her dowry.    \"If a man seize hold of the breast of a ceorlish woman, let him  make bot to her with 5 shillings. If he throw her down and do not  lie with her, let him make bot with 10 shillings. If he lie with  her, let him make bot with 60 shillings. If another man had before  lain with her, then let the bot be half that. ... If this befall a  woman more nobly born, let the bot increase according to the wer.\"    \"If any one, with libidinous intent, seize a nun either by her  raiment or by her breast without her leave, let the bot be  twofold, as we have before ordained concerning a laywoman.\"    \"If a man commit a rape upon a ceorl's female slave, he must pay  bot to the ceorl of 5 shillings and a wite [fine to the King] of  60 shillings. If a male theow rape a female theow, let him make  bot with his testicles.\"    For the first dog bite, the owner pays 6 shillings, for the  second, 12"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#8)"],[1,"and cleanses the lungs, stimulates the cells and gives a  general tone to the respiratory organs, and is conducive to their  general healthy condition. Besides this effect, it is found to greatly  refresh the entire system. Speakers, singers, etc., will find this  breath especially restful, after having tired the respiratory organs.         (1) Inhale a complete breath.         (2) Retain the air a few seconds.         (3) Pucker up the lips as if for a whistle (but do not swell       out the cheeks), then exhale a little air through the       opening, with considerable vigor. Then stop for a moment,       retaining the air, and then exhale a little more air. Repeat       until the air is completely exhaled. Remember that       considerable vigor is to be used in exhaling the air through       the opening in the lips.    This breath will be found quite refreshing when one is tired and  generally \"used up.\" A trial will convince the student of its merits.  This exercise should be practiced until it can be performed naturally  and easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises  given in this book, and it should be thoroughly understood.      THE YOGI NERVE VITALIZING BREATH.    This is an exercise well known to the Yogis, who consider it one of  the strongest nerve stimulants and invigorants known to man. Its  purpose is to stimulate the Nervous System, develop nerve force,  energy and vitality. This exercise brings a stimulating pressure to  bear on important nerve centers, which in turn stimulate and energize  the entire nervous system, and send an increased flow of nerve force  to all parts of the body.         (1) Stand erect.         (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, and retain same.         (3) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting them       be somewhat limp and relaxed, with only sufficient nerve       force to hold them out.         (4) Slowly draw the hands back toward the shoulders,       gradually contracting the muscles and putting force into       them, so that when they reach the shoulders the fists will       be so tightly clenched that a tremulous motion is felt.         (5) Then, keeping the muscles tense, push the fists slowly       out, and then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several       times.         (6) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.         (7) Practice the Cleansing Breath.    The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the  drawing back of the fists, and the tension of the muscles, and, of  course, upon the full lungs. This exercise must be tried to be  appreciated. It is without equal as a \"bracer,\" as our Western friends  put it.      THE YOGI VOCAL BREATH.    The Yogis have a form of breathing to develop the voice. They are  noted for their wonderful voices, which are strong, smooth and clear,  and have a wonderful trumpet-like carrying power. They have practiced  this particular form of breathing exercise which has resulted in  rendering their voices soft, beautiful and flexible, imparting to it  that indescribable, peculiar floating quality, combined with great  power. The exercise given below will in time impart the  above-mentioned qualities, or the Yogi Voice, to the student who  practices it faithfully. It is to be understood, of course, that this  form of breath is to be used only as an occasional exercise, and not  as a regular form of breathing.         (1) Inhale a Complete Breath very slowly, but steadily,       through the nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the       inhalation.         (2) Retain for a few seconds.         (3) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath, through       the wide opened mouth.         (4) Rest the lungs by the Cleansing Breath.    Without going deeply into the Yogi theories of sound-production in  speaking and singing, we wish to say that experience has taught them  that the timbre, quality and power of a voice depends not alone upon  the vocal organs in the throat, but that the facial muscles, etc.,  have much to do with the matter. Some men with large chests produce  but a poor tone, while others with comparatively small chests produce  tones of amazing strength and quality. Here is an interesting  experiment worth trying: Stand before a glass and pucker up your mouth  and whistle, and note the shape of your mouth and the general  expression of your face. Then sing or speak as you do naturally, and  see the difference. Then start to whistle again for a few seconds, and  then, _without changing the position of your lips or face_, sing a few  notes and notice what a vibrant, resonant, clear and beautiful tone is  produced.          CHAPTER XI.      THE SEVEN YOGI DEVELOPING EXERCISES.    The following are the seven favorite exercises of the Yogis for  developing the lungs, muscles, ligaments, air cells, etc. They are  quite simple but marvelously effective. Do not let the simplicity of  these exercises make you lose interest, for they are the result of  careful experiments and practice on the part of the Yogis, and are the  essence of numerous intricate and complicated exercises, the  non-essential portions being eliminated and the essential features  retained.    (1) THE RETAINED BREATH.    This is a very important exercise which tends to strengthen and  develop the respiratory muscles as well as the lungs, and its frequent  practice will also tend to expand the chest. The Yogis have found that  an occasional holding of the breath, after the lungs have been filled  with the Complete Breath, is very beneficial, not only to the  respiratory organs but to the organs of nutrition, the nervous system  and the blood itself. They have found that an occasional holding of  the breath tends to purify the air which has remained in the lungs  from former inhalations, and to more fully oxygenate the blood. They  also know that the breath so retained gathers up all the waste matter,  and when the breath is expelled it carries with it the effete matter  of the system, and cleanses the lungs just as a purgative does the  bowels. The Yogis recommend this exercise for various disorders of the  stomach, liver and blood, and also find that it frequently relieves  bad breath, which often arises from poorly ventilated lungs. We  recommend students to pay considerable attention to this exercise, as  it has great merits. The following directions will give you a clear  idea of the exercise:         (1) Stand erect.         (2) Inhale a Complete Breath.         (3) Retain the air as long as you can comfortably.         (4) Exhale vigorously through the open mouth.         (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.    At first you will be able to retain the breath only a short time, but  a little practice will also show a great improvement. Time yourself  with a watch if you wish to note your progress.    (2) LUNG CELL STIMULATION.    This exercise is designed to stimulate the air cells in the lungs, but  beginners must not overdo it, and in no case should it be indulged in  too vigorously. Some may find a slight dizziness resulting from the  first few trials, in which case let them walk around a little and  discontinue the exercise for a while.         (1) Stand erect, with hands at sides.         (2) Breathe in very slowly and gradually.         (3) While inhaling, gently tap the chest with the finger       tips, constantly changing position.         (4) When the lungs are filled, retain the breath and pat the       chest with the palms of the hands.         (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.    This exercise is very bracing and stimulating to the whole body, and  is a well-known Yogi practice. Many of the air cells of the lungs  become inactive by reason of incomplete breathing, and often become  almost atrophied. One who has practiced imperfect breathing for years  will find it not so easy to stimulate all these ill-used air cells  into activity all at once by the Complete Breath, but this exercise  will do much toward bringing about the desired result, and is worth  study and practice.    (3) RIB STRETCHING.    We have explained that the ribs are fastened by cartilages, which  admit of considerable expansion. In proper breathing, the ribs play an  important part, and it is well to occasionally give them a little  special exercise in order to preserve their elasticity. Standing or  sitting in unnatural positions, to which many of the Western people  are addicted, is apt to render the ribs more or less stiff and  inelastic, and this exercise will do much to overcome same.         (1) Stand erect.         (2) Place the hands one on each side of the body, as high up       under the armpits as convenient, the thumbs reaching toward       the back, the palms on the side of the chest and the fingers       to the front over the breast.         (3) Inhale a Complete Breath.         (4) Retain the air for a short time.         (5) Then gently squeeze the sides, at the same time slowly       exhaling.         (6) Practice the cleansing breath.    Use moderation in this exercise and do not overdo its    (4) CHEST EXPANSION.    The chest is quite apt to be contracted from bending over one's work,  etc. This exercise is very good for the purpose of restoring natural  conditions and gaining chest expansion.         (1) Stand erect.         (2) Inhale a Complete Breath.         (3) Retain the air.         (4) Extend both arms forward and bring the two clenched       fists together on a level with the shoulder.         (5) Then swing back the fists vigorously until the arms       stand out straight sideways from the shoulders.         (6) Then bring back to Position 4, and swing to Position 5.       Repeat several times.         (7) Exhale vigorously through the opened mouth.         (8) Practice the Cleansing Breath.    Use moderation and do not overdo this exercise.    (5) WALKING EXERCISE.         (1) Walk with head up, chin drawn slightly in, shoulders       back, and with measured tread.         (2) Inhale"]]]
