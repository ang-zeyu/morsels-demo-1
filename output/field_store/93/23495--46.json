I want you to feel from the start that I am a true friend, and  that I have your welfare very much at heart. Without the confidence of  my cowboys, I can do nothing. Are there any more at home like you?\"    Andy looked at her suspiciously, but it was so evident she never meant  to quote comic opera, that he merely wondered anew. He struggled  feebly against temptation, and fell from grace quite willingly. It  isn't polite to \"throw a load\" at a lady, but then Andy felt that  neither was it polite for a lady to come out with the avowed intention  of improving him and his fellows; it looked to him like butting in  where she was not wanted, or needed.    \"Yes, ma'am, there's quite a bunch, and they're pretty bad. I don't  believe you can do much for 'em.\" He spoke regretfully.    \"Do they--_drink_?\" she asked, leaning forward and speaking in the  hushed voice with which some women approach a tabooed subject.    \"Yes ma'am, they do. They're hard drinkers. And they\"--he eyed her  speculatively, trying to guess the worst sins in her category--\"they  play cards--gamble--and swear, and smoke cigarettes and--\"    \"All the more need of someone to help them overcome,\" she decided  solemnly. \"What you need is a coffee-house and reading room here, so  that the young men will have some place to go other than the saloons.  I shall see to that right away. And with the Mutual Improvement and  Social Society organized and working smoothly, and a library of  standard works for recreation, together with earnest personal efforts  to promote temperance and clean-living, I feel that a _wonderful_ work  can be done. I saw you drive into town, so I know you can take me out  with you; I hope you are going to start soon. I feel very impatient to  reach the field and put my sickle to the harvest.\"    Andy mentally threw up his hands before this unshakable person. He had  meant to tell her that he had come on horseback, but she had  forestalled him. He had meant to discourage her--head her off, he  called it to himself. But there seemed no way of doing it. He pushed  back his chair and rose, though he had not tasted his pie, and it was  lemon pie at that. He had some faint notion of hurrying out of town  and home before she could have time to get ready; but she followed him  to the door and chirped over his shoulder that it wouldn't take her  two minutes to put on her wraps. Andy groaned.    He tried--or started to try--holding out at Rusty Brown's till she  gave up in despair; but it occurred to him that Chip had asked him to  hurry back. Andy groaned again, and got the team.    She did not wait for him to drive around to the hotel for her;  possibly she suspected his intentions. At any rate, she came nipping  down the street toward the stable just as he was hooking the last  trace, and she was all ready and had a load of bags and bundles.    \"I'm not going to begin by making trouble for you,\" she twittered. \"I  thought I could just as well come down here to the wagon as have you  drive back to the hotel. And my trunk did not come on the train with  me, so I'm all ready.\"    Andy, having nothing in mind that he dared say to a lady, helped her  into the wagon.    At sundown or thereabouts--for the days were short and he had a load  of various things besides care--Andy let himself wearily into the  bunk-house where was assembled the Happy Family. He merely grunted  when they spoke to him, and threw himself heavily down upon his bunk.    \"For Heaven's sake, somebody roll me a cigarette! I'm too wore out to  do a thing, and I haven't had a smoke since dinner,\" he groaned, after  a minute.    \"Sick?\" asked Pink solicitously.    \"Sick as a dog! water, water!\" moaned Andy. All at once he rolled over  upon his face and shook with laughter more than a little hysterical,  and to the questioning of the Happy Family gave no answer but howls.  The Happy Family began to look at one another uneasily.    \"Aw, let up!\" Happy Jack bellowed. \"You give a man the creeps just to  listen at yuh.\"    \"I'm going to empty the water-bucket over yuh in a minute,\" Pink  threatened, \"Go get it, Cal; it's half full.\"    Andy knew well the metal of which the Happy Family was made, and the  night was cool for a ducking. He rolled back so that they could see  his face, and struggled for calm. In a minute he sat up and merely  gurgled.    \"Well, say, I had to do something or die,\" he explained, gasping.  \"I've gone through a heap, the last few hours, and I was right where I  couldn't do a thing. By gracious, I struck the ranch about as near  bug-house as a man can get and recover. Where's a cigarette?\"    \"What you've gone through--and I don't give a cuss what it is--ain't a  marker for what's going to happen if yuh don't loosen up on the  history,\" said Jack Bates firmly.    Andy smoked hungrily while he surveyed the lot. \"How calm and innocent  yuh all look,\" he observed musingly, \"with your hats on and saying  words that's rude, and smoking the vile weed regardless, never  dreaming what's going to drop, pretty soon quick. Yuh make me think of  a hymn-song my step-mother used to sing a lot, about 'They dreamed not  of danger, those sinners of old, whom--\"    \"Hand me the water bucket,\" directed Pink musically.    \"Oh, well--take it from the shoulder, then; I was only trying to lead  up to it gradual, but yuh _will_ have it raw. You poor, dear cowboys,  that live your lonely lives watching over your cattle with your  _faithful dogs_ and the stars for company, you're going to be  _improved_. (You'll sure stand a lot of it, too!) A woman's relief  club back East has felt the burden of your no-accountness and general  orneriness, and has sent one of its leading members out here to reform  yuh. You're going to be hazed into a Cowboys' Mutual Improvement and  Social Society, and quit smoking cigarettes and cussing your hosses  and laying over Rusty's bar when yuh ride into town; and for pleasure  and recreation you're going to read Tennyson's poems, and when yuh get  caught out in a blizzard yuh'll be heeled with Whittier's _Snowbound_,  pocket edition. Emerson and Browning and Shakespeare and Gatty\" (Andy  misquoted; he meant Goethe) \"and all them stiffs is going to be set  before yuh regular and in your mind constant, purging it of unclean  thoughts, and grammar is going to be learnt yuh as a side-line. Yuh--\"    \"Mama mine,\" broke in Weary. \"I have thought sometimes, when Andy  broke loose with that imagination uh his, that he'd gone the limit;  but next time he always raises the limit out uh sight. He's like the  Good Book says: he's prone to lie as the sparks fly-upward.\"    Andy gazed belligerently at the skeptical group. \"I brought her out  from town,\" he said doggedly, \"and whilst I own up to having an  imagination, she's stranger than fiction. She'd make the fellow that  wrote \"She\" lay down with a headache. She's come out here to help us  cowboys live nobler, better lives. She's going to learn yuh Browning,  darn yuh! and Emerson and Gatty. She said so. She's going to fill your  hearts with love for dumb creatures, so when yuh get set afoot out on  the range, or anything like that, yuh won't put in your time cussing  the miles between you and camp; you'll have a pocket edition of 'Much  Ado About Nothing' to read, or the speech Mark Anthony made when he  was running for office. Or supposing yuh left 'em all in camp, yuh'll  study nature. There's sermons in stones, she says. She's going to send  for a pocket library that can easy be took on roundup--\"    \"Say, I guess that's about enough,\" interrupted Pink restlessly. \"We  all admit you're the biggest liar that ever come West of the  Mississippi, without you laying it on any deeper.\"    Whereupon Andy rose in wrath and made a suggestive movement with his  fist. \"If I was romancing,\" he declared indignantly, \"I'd do a  smoother job; when I do lie, I notice yuh all believe it--till yuh  find out different. And by gracious yuh might do as much when I'm  telling the truth! Go up to the White House and see, darn yuh! If yuh  don't find Miss Verbena Martin up there telling the Little Doctor how  her heart goes out to her dear cowboys and how she's going to get in  touch with 'em and help 'em lead nobler, better lives, you can kick me  all round the yard. And I hope, by gracious, she _does_ improve yuh!  Yuh sure do need it a lot.\"    The Happy Family discussed the tale freely and without regard for the  feelings of Andy; they even became heated and impolite, and they made  threats. They said that a liar like him ought to be lynched or gagged,  and that he was a disgrace to the outfit. In the end, however, they  decided to go and see, just to prove to Andy that they knew he lied.  And though it was settled that Weary and Pink should be the  investigating committee, by the time they were halfway to the White  House they had the whole Happy Family trailing at their heels. A light  snow had begun to fall since dark, and they hunched their shoulders  against it as they went. Grouped uncomfortably just outside the circle  of light cast through the unshaded window, they gazed silently in upon  Chip and the Little Doctor and J.G. Whitmore, and upon one other; a  strange lady in a black silk shirtwaist and a gold watch suspended  from her neck by a chaste, black silken cord; a strange lady with  symmetrical waves in her hair and gray on her temples, and with  glasses and an eager way of speaking.    She was talking very rapidly and animatedly, and the others were  listening and stealing glances now and then at one another. Once,  while they watched, the Little Doctor looked at Chip and then turned  her face toward the window. She was biting her lips in the way the  Happy Family had learned to recognize as a great desire to laugh. It  all looked suspicious and corroborative of Andy's story, and the Happy  Family shifted their feet uneasily in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#8)"],[1,"s, he  bore a smaller part than Salman in the practical development of Karaism.  His \"Hebrew Grammar\" (_Sefer Dikduk_) and his Lexicon (_Leshon  Limmudim_) were very popular. Unlike the work of other Karaites, Joseph  al-Bazir's writings were philosophical, and had no philological value.  He was an adherent of the Mohammedan theological method known as the  Kalam, and wrote mostly in Arabic. Another Karaite of the same period,  Hassan, the son of Mashiach, was the one who impelled Saadiah to throw  off all reserves and enter the lists as a champion of Rabbinism. Of the  remaining Karaites of the tenth century, the foremost was Japhet, the  son of Ali, whose commentaries on the Bible represent the highest  achievements of Karaism. A large Hebrew dictionary (_Iggaron_), by a  contemporary of Japhet named David, the son of Abraham, is also a work  which was often quoted. Kirkisani, also a tenth century Karaite,  completed in the year 937 a treatise called, \"The Book of Lights and the  High Beacons.\" In this work much valuable information is supplied as to  the history of Karaism. Despite his natural prejudices in favor of his  own sect, Kirkisani is a faithful historian, as frank regarding the  internal dissensions of the Karaites as in depicting the divergence of  views among the Rabbinites. Kirkisani's work is thus of the greatest  importance for the history of Jewish sects.    Finally, the famous Karaite Judah Hadassi (1075-1160) was a young man  when his native Jerusalem was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. A  wanderer to Constantinople, he devoted himself to science, Hebrew  philology, and Greek literature. He utilized his wide knowledge in his  great work, \"A Cluster of Cyprus Flowers\" (_Eshkol ha-Kopher_), which  was completed in 1150. It is written in a series of rhymed alphabetical  acrostics. It is encyclopedic in range, and treats critically, not only  of Judaism, but also of Christianity and Islam.    Karaitic literature was produced in later centuries also, but by the end  of the twelfth century, Karaism had exhausted its originality and  fertility. One much later product of Karaism, however, deserves special  mention. Isaac Troki composed, in 1593, a work entitled \"The  Strengthening of Faith\" (_Chizzuk Emunah_), in which the author defended  Judaism and attacked Christianity. It was a lucid book, and as its  arguments were popularly arranged, it was very much read and used. With  this exception, Karaism produced no important work after the twelfth  century.    On the intellectual side, therefore, Karaism was a powerful though  ephemeral movement. In several branches of science and philology the  Karaites made real additions to contemporary knowledge. But the main  service of Karaism was indirect. The Rabbinite Jews, who represented the  mass of the people, had been on the way to a scientific and  philosophical development of their own before the rise of Karaism. The  necessity of fighting Karaism with its own weapons gave a strong impetus  to the new movement in Rabbinism, and some of the best work of Saadiah  was inspired by Karaitic opposition. Before, however, we turn to the  career of Saadiah, we must consider another literary movement, which  coincided in date with the rise of Karaism, but was entirely independent  of it.

Arabic to a large extent replaced Hebrew as the literary language of the  Jews, but Hebrew continued the language of prayer. As a mere literary  form, Rabbinic Hebrew retained a strong hold on the Jews; as a vehicle  of devotional feeling, Hebrew reigned supreme. The earliest additions to  the fixed liturgy of the Synagogue were prose-poems. They were  \"Occasional Prayers\" composed by the precentor for a special occasion.  An appropriate melody or chant accompanied the new hymn, and if the poem  and melody met the popular taste, both won a permanent place in the  local liturgy. The hymns were unrhymed and unmetrical, but they may have  been written in the form of alphabetical acrostics, such as appear in  the 119th and a few other Psalms.    It is not impossible that metre and rhyme grew naturally from the  Biblical Hebrew. Rhyme is unknown in the Bible, but the assonances which  occur may easily run into rhymes. Musical form is certainly present in  Hebrew poetry, though strict metres are foreign to it. As an historical  fact, however, Hebrew rhymed verse can be traced on the one side to  Syriac, on the other to Arabic influences. In the latter case the  influence was external only. Early Arabic poetry treats of war and love,  but the first Jewish rhymsters sang of peace and duty. The Arab wrote  for the camp, the Jew for the synagogue.    Two distinct types of verse, or _Piyut_ (i.e. Poetry), arose within the  Jewish circle: the ingenious and the natural. In the former, the style  is rugged and involved; a profusion of rare words and obscure allusions  meets and troubles the reader; the verse lacks all beauty of form, yet  is alive with intense spiritual force. This style is often termed  Kalirian, from the name of its best representative. The Kalirian Piyut  in the end spread chiefly to France, England, Burgundy, Lorraine,  Germany, Bohemia, Poland, Italy, Greece, and Palestine. The other type  of new-Hebrew Piyut, the Spanish, rises to higher beauties of form. It  is not free from the Kalirian faults, but it has them in a less  pronounced degree. The Spanish Piyut, in the hands of one or two  masters, becomes true poetry, poetry in form as well as in idea. The  Spanish style prevailed in Castile, Andalusia, Catalonia, Aragon,  Majorca, Provence, and in countries where Arabic influence was  strongest.    Kalir was the most popular writer of the earlier type of new-Hebrew  poetry, but he was not its creator. An older contemporary of his, from  whom he derived both his diction and his method of treating poetic  subjects, was Jannai. Though we know that Jannai was a prolific writer,  only seven short examples of his verse remain. One of these is the  popular hymn, \"It was at Midnight,\" which is still recited by \"German\"  Jews at the home-service on the first eve of Passover. It recounts in  order the deliverances which, according to the Midrash, were wrought for  Israel at midnight, from Abraham's victory over the four kings to the  wakefulness of Ahasuerus, the crisis of the Book of Esther. In the last  stanza is a prayer for future redemption:        Bring nigh the hour which is nor day nor night!      Most High! make known that thine is day, and           thine the night!      Make clear as day the darkness of our night!          As of old at midnight.    This form of versification, with a running refrain, afterwards became  very popular with Jewish poets. Jannai also displays the harsh  alliterations, the learned allusions to Midrash and Talmud, which were  carried to extremes by Kalir.    It is strange that it is impossible to fix with any certainty the date  at which Jannai and Kalir lived. Kalir may belong to the eighth or to  the ninth century. It is equally hard to decide as to his birth-place.  Rival theories hold that he was born in Palestine and in Sardinia. His  name has been derived from Cagliari in Sardinia and from the Latin  _calyrum_, a cake. Honey-cakes were given to Jewish children on their  first introduction to school, and the nickname \"Kaliri,\" or \"Boy of the  Cake,\" may have arisen from his youthful precocity. But all this is mere  guess-work.    It is more certain that the poet was also the singer of his own verses.  His earliest audiences were probably scholars, and this may have tempted  Kalir to indulge in the recondite learning which vitiates his hymns. At  his worst, Kalir is very bad indeed; his style is then a jumble of  words, his meaning obscure and even unintelligible. He uses a maze of  alphabetical acrostics, line by line he wreathes into his compositions  the words of successive Bible texts. Yet even at his worst he is  ingenious and vigorous. Such phrases as \"to hawk it as a hawk upon a  sparrow\" are at least bold and effective. Ibn Ezra later on lamented  that Kalir had treated the Hebrew language like an unfenced city. But if  the poet too freely admitted strange and ugly words, he added many of  considerable force and beauty. Kalir rightly felt that if Hebrew was to  remain a living tongue, it was absurd to restrict the language to the  vocabulary of the Bible. Hence he invented many new verbs from nouns.    But his inventiveness was less marked than his learning. \"With the  permission of God, I will speak in riddles,\" says Kalir in opening the  prayer for dew. The riddles are mainly clever allusions to the Midrash.  It has been pointed out that these allusions are often tasteless and  obscure. But they are more often beautiful and inspiring. No Hebrew  poet in the Middle Ages was illiterate, for the poetic instinct was fed  on the fancies of the Midrash. This accounts for their lack of freshness  and originality. The poet was a scholar, and he was also a teacher. Much  of Kalir's work is didactic; it teaches the traditional explanations of  the Bible and the ritual laws for Sabbath and festivals; it provides a  convenient summary of the six hundred and thirteen precepts into which  the duties of the Law were arranged. But over and above all this the  genius of Kalir soars to poetic heights. So much has been said of  Kalir's obscurity that one quotation must, in fairness be given of Kalir  at his"]]]
