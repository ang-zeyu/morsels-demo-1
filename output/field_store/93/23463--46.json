My former Letter prepares you for the celebration of Mahurrum, the  observance of which is at this time going forward here (at Lucknow) with  all that zealous emulative spirit and enthusiasm which I have before  remarked the Mussulmaun population of India entertain for their Emaums  (leaders), and their religion.    This annual solemn display of the regret and veneration they consider due  to the memory of departed excellence, commences on the first day of the  Moon (Mahurrum). The Mussulmaun year has twelve moons; every third year  one moon is added, which regulation, I fancy, renders their years, in a  chronological point of view, very nearly equal with those of Europe. Their  day commences and ends when the stars are first visible after sunset.    The first day of Mahurrum invariably brings to my recollection the  strongly impressed ideas of 'The Deserted Village'. The profound quiet and  solemn stillness of an extensively populated native city, contrasted with  the incessant bustle usual at all other times, are too striking to  Europeans to pass by unheeded. This cessation of the animated scene,  however, is not of long duration; the second day presents to the view vast  multitudes of people parading backwards and forwards, on horseback, in  palkies, and on foot, through the broad streets and roadways, arrayed in  their several mourning garbs, speeding their way to the Emaum-baarahs[1]  of the great men, and the houses of friends, to pay the visit of respect  (zeearut), wherever a Tazia is set up to the remembrance of Hasan and  Hosein.    The word Tazia[2] signifies grief. The term is applied to a representation  of the mausoleum at Kraabaallah, erected by their friends and followers,  over the remains of Hasan and Hosein. It is formed of every variety of  material, according to the wealth, rank, or preference, of the person  exhibiting, from the purest silver down to bamboo and paper, strict  attention being always paid to preserve the model of Kraabaallah, in the  exact pattern with the original building. Some people have them of ivory,  ebony, sandal-wood, cedar, &c., and I have seen some beautifully wrought  in silver filigree. The handsomest of the kind, to my taste, is in the  possession of his Majesty the King of Oude, composed of green glass, with  brass mouldings, manufactured in England (by whom I could not learn). All  these expensive Tazias are fixtures, but there are temporary ones required  for the out-door ceremony, which, like those available to the poor and  middling classes, are composed of bamboo frames, over which is fixed  coloured uberuck[3] (lapis specularum, or tulk); these are made in the  bazaar, of various sizes and qualities, to suit the views of purchasers,  from two rupees to two hundred each.    The more common Tazias are conveyed in the procession on the tenth day,  and finally deposited with funeral rites in the public burial-grounds, of  which there are several outside the town. These cemeteries are denominated  Kraabaallah,[4] and the population of a large city may be presumed on by  the number of these dispersed in the suburbs. They do not bury their dead  in the vicinity of a mosque, which is held too sacred to be allowed the  pollution. Any one having only touched a dead body, must bathe prior to  entering the mosque, or performing their usual prayer-service at  home;--such is the veneration they entertain for the name of God.    The opulent people of Mussulmaun society have an Emaum-baarah erected in  the range of buildings exclusively denominated murdanah[5] (men's abode).  The habitation of all Mussulmauns being composed of separate departments  for the males and the females, communicating by private entrances, as will  be explained hereafter.    The Emaum-baarah is a sacred place, erected for the express purpose of  commemorating Mahurrum; the founder not unfrequently intends this also as  the mausoleum for himself and family. But we generally find Mukhburrahs[6]  (mausoleums) built in conspicuous situations, for the remains of kings,  princes, nobles, and sainted persons. Of the latter, many are visited, at  stated periods, by the multitude, with religious veneration, the  illiterate attaching considerable importance to the annual pilgrimage to  them; and where--to secure the influence of the particular saint's spirit,  in furthering their views--mothers present their children, in numbers  beyond all calculation; and each having something to hope for who visits  the shrine, presents offerings of money and sweetmeats, which become the  property of the person in charge of the tomb, thus yielding him a  profitable sinecure, in proportion as the saint is popular amongst the  ignorant.    An Emaum-baarah is a square building, generally erected with a cupola top,  the dimensions guided by the circumstances of the founder. The floor is  matted with the date-leaf mats, in common use in India, on which is spread  a shutteringhie[7] (cotton carpet), and over this a clean white calico  covering, on which the assembled party are seated, during the several  periods of collecting together to remember their leaders: these meetings  are termed Mudgelluss[8] (mourning assemblies). It would be esteemed  indecorous or disrespectful to the Emaums, if any one in error called  these assemblies Moollakhaut,[9] the usual term for mere worldly visiting.    The Tazia is placed against the wall on the side facing Mecca, under a  canopy of rich embroidery. A reading-desk or pulpit (mhembur[10]) is  placed in a convenient situation, for the reader to face Mecca, and his  voice to be heard by the whole assembly of people; it is constructed of  silver, ivory, ebony, &c. to correspond with the Tazia, if possible: the  steps are covered sometimes with gold-cloth, or broad-cloth of black, or  green,[11] if a Syaad's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#8)"],[1,"forlorn.\"    5 But thou art he who form'd my flesh  By thine almighty word,  And since I hung upon the breast,  My hope is in the Lord.    6 Why will my Father hide his face,  When foes stand threatening round,  In the dark hour of deep distress,  And not an helper found?    PAUSE.    7 Behold thy darling left among  The cruel and the proud,  As bulls of Bashan fierce and strong,  As lions roaring loud.    8 From earth and hell my sorrows meet  To multiply the smart;  They nail my hands, they pierce my feet  And try to vex my heart.    9 Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose  The rage of earth and hell,  Why will my heavenly Father bruise  The Son he loves so well?    10 My God, if possible it be,  Withhold this bitter cup;  But I resign my will to thee,  And drink the sorrows up.    11 My heart dissolves with pangs unknown  In groans I waste my breath;  Thy heavy hand has brought me down  Low as the dust of death.    12 Father, I give my spirit up;  And trust it in thy hand;  My dying flesh shall rest in hope,  And rise at thy command.

Christ's sufferings and kingdom.    1 \"Now from the roaring lion's rage,  \"O Lord, protect thy Son;  \"Nor leave thy darling to engage,  \"The powers of hell alone.\"    2 Thus did our suffering Saviour pray,  With mighty cries and tears;  God heard him in that dreadful day,  And chas'd away his fears.    3 Great was the victory of his death,  His throne exalted high;  And all the kindreds of the earth  Shall worship or shall die.    4 A numerous offspring must arise  From his expiring groans;  They shall be reckon'd in his eyes  For daughters and for sons.    5 The meek and humble soul shall see  His table richly spread;  And all that seek the Lord shall be  With joys immortal fed.    6 The isles shall know the righteousness  Of our incarnate God;  And nations yet unborn profess  Salvation in his blood.      Psalm 22:3. L. M.  Christ's sufferings and exaltation.    1 Now let our mournful songs record  The dying sorrows of our Lord;  When he complain'd in tears and blood  As one forsaken of his God.    2 The Jews beheld him thus forlorn,  And shake their heads, and laugh in scorn;  \"He rescu'd others from the grave,  \"Now let him try himself to save.    3 \"This is the man did once pretend  \"God was his father and his friend;  \"If God the blessed lov'd him so,  \"Why doth he fail to help him now?\"    4 Barbarous people! cruel priests!  How they stood round like savage beasts!  Like lions gaping to devour,  When God had left him in their power.    5 They wound his head, his hands, his feet,  Till streams of blood each other meet;  By lot his garments they divide  And mock the pangs in which he dy'd.    6 But God, his Father, heard his cry:  Rais'd from the dead he reigns on high.  The nations learn his righteousness,  And humble sinners taste his grace.      Psalm 23:1. L. M.  God our Shepherd.    1 My shepherd is the living Lord;  Now shall my wants be well supply'd  His providence and holy word  Become my safety and my guide.    2 In pastures where salvation grows  He makes me feed, he makes me rest;  There living water gently flows,  And all the food's divinely blest.    3 My wandering feet his ways mistake,  But he restores my soul to peace,  And leads me for his mercy's sake,  In the fair paths of righteousness.    4 Tho' I walk thro' the gloomy vale,  Where death and all its terrors are,  My heart and hope shall never fail,  For God my shepherd's with me there.    5 Amidst the darkness and the deeps  Thou art my comfort, thou my stay;  Thy staff supports my feeble steps,  Thy rod directs my doubtful way.    6 The sons of earth and sons of hell  Gaze at thy goodness and repine  To see my table spread so well  With living bread and cheerful wine.    7 [How I rejoice when on my head  Thy Spirit condescends to rest!  'Tis a divine anointing shed  Like oil of gladness at a feast.    8 Surely the mercies of the Lord  Attend his household all their days;  There will I dwell to hear his word,  To seek his face, and sing his praise.]      Psalm 23:2. C. M.  The same.    1. My Shepherd will supply my need,  Jehovah is his name;  In pastures fresh he makes me feed  Beside the living stream.    2 He brings my wandering spirit back,  When I forsake his ways;  And leads me for his mercy's sake,  In paths of truth and grace.    3 When I walk thro' the shades of death,  Thy presence is my stay;  A word of thy supporting breath  Drives all my fears away.    4 Thy hand, in spite of all my foes,  Doth still my table spread;  My cup with blessings overflows,  Thine oil anoints my head.    5 The sure provisions of my God  Attend me all my days;  O may thy house be mine abode,  And all my work be praise!    6 There would I find a settled rest,  (While others go and come)  No more a stranger or a guest,  But like a child at home.      Psalm 23:3. S. M.  The same.    1 The Lord my shepherd is,  I shall be well supply'd;  Since he is mine, and I am his,  What can I want beside?    2 He leads me to the place  Where heavenly pasture grows,  Where living waters gently pass,  And full salvation flows.    3 If e'er I go astray,  He doth my soul reclaim,  And guides me in his own right way,  For his most holy name.    4 While he affords his aid,  I cannot yield to fear;  Tho' I should walk thro' death's dark shade  My Shepherd's with me there.    5 In spite of all my foes,  Thou dost my table spread,  My cup with blessings overflows,  And joy exalts my head.    6 The bounties of thy love  Shall crown my following days;  Nor from thy house will I remove,  Nor cease to speak thy praise.      Psalm 24:1. C. M.  Dwelling with God.    1 The earth for ever is the Lord's,  With Adam's numerous race;  He rais'd its arches o'er the floods,  And built it on the seas.    2 But who among the sons of men  May visit thine abode?  He that has hands from mischief clean,  Whose heart is right with God.    3 This is the man may rise, and take  The blessings of his grace;  This is the lot of those that seek  The God of Jacob's face.    4 Now let our soul's immortal powers  To meet the Lord prepare,  Lift up their everlasting doors,  The King of glory's near.    5 The King of glory! who can tell  The wonders of his might!  He rules the nations; but to dwell  With saints is his delight.      Psalm 24:2. L. M.  Saints dwell in heaven; or, Christ's ascension.    1 This spacious earth is all the Lord's,  And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds:  He rais'd the building on the seas,  And gave it for their dwelling-place.    2 But there's a brighter world on high,  Thy palace, Lord, above the sky:  Who shall ascend that blest abode,  And dwell so near his Maker God?    3 He that abhors and fears to sin,  Whose heart is pure whose hands are clean,  Him shall the Lord the Saviour bless,  And clothe his soul with righteousness.    4 These are the men, the pious race  That seek the God of Jacob's face;  These shall enjoy the blissful sight,  And dwell in everlasting light.    PAUSE.    5 Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high,  Behold the King of glory nigh!  Who can this King of glory be?  The mighty Lord, the Saviour's he.    6 Ye heavenly gates, your leaves display  To make the Lord the Saviour way:  Laden with spoils from earth and hell,  The conqueror comes with God to dwell.    7 Rais'd from the dead he goes before,  He opens heaven's eternal door,  To give his saints a blest abode  Near their Redeemer, and their God.      Psalm 25:1. 1-11. First Part.  Waiting for pardon and direction.    1 I Lift my soul to God,  My trust is in his name;  Let not my foes that seek my blood  Still triumph in my shame.    2 Sin and the powers of hell  Persuade me to despair;  Lord, make me know thy covenant well,  That I may 'scape the snare.    3 From the first dawning light  Till the dark evening rise,  For thy salvation, Lord, I wait  With ever-longing eyes.    4 Remember all thy grace,  And lead me in thy truth;  Forgive the sins of riper days,  And follies of my youth.    5 The Lord is just and kind,  The meek shall learn his ways;  And every humble sinner find  The methods of his grace.    6 For his own goodness' sake  He saves my soul from shame;  He pardons (tho' my guilt be great)  Thro' my Redeemer's name.      Psalm 25:2. 12 14 10 13. Second Part.  Divine instruction.    1 Where shall the man be found  That fears t' offend his God,  That loves the gospel's joyful sound,  And trembles at the rod?    2 The Lord shall make him know  The secrets of his heart,  The wonders of his covenant show,  And all his love impart.    3 The dealings of his hand  Are truth and mercy still  With such as to his covenant stand,  And love to do his will.    4 Their souls shall dwell at ease  Before their Maker's face,  Their seed shall taste the promises,  In their extensive grace.      Psalm 25:3. 15-22. Third Part.  Distress of soul; or, Backsliding and desertion.    1 Mine eyes and my desire  Are ever to the Lord;  I love to plead his promises,  And rest upon his word.    2 Turn, turn thee to my soul,  Bring thy salvation near:  When will thy hand release my feet  Out of the deadly snare?    3 When shall the sovereign grace  Of my forgiving God  Restore me from those dangerous ways  My wandering feet have trod?    4 The tumult of my thoughts  Doth but enlarge my woe;  My spirit languishes, my heart  Is desolate and low.    5 With every morning light  My sorrow new begins;  Look on my anguish and my pain,  And pardon all my sins.    PAUSE.    6 Behold the hosts of hell  How cruel is their hate!  Against my life they rise, and join  Their fury with deceit.    7 O keep my soul from death,  Nor put my hope to shame,  For I have plac'd my only trust  In my Redeemer's name.    8 With humble faith I wait  To see thy face again;  Of Israel it shall ne'er be said,  \"He sought the Lord in vain.\"      Psalm 26.  Self-examination; or, Evidences of grace.    1 Judge me, O Lord, and prove my ways,  And try my reins, and try "]]]
