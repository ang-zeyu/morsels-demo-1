Her  dominion is one of love, not of arbitrary power.    We are satisfied, therefore, that the pure, cultivated, and pious  ladies of this country now exercise a very powerful, but quiet,  imperceptible influence in popular affairs, much greater than they  can ever again exercise if female suffrage should be enacted and they  should be compelled actively to take part in the affairs of state and  the corruptions of party politics.    It would be a gratification, and we are always glad to see the ladies  gratified, to many who have espoused the cause of woman suffrage if  they could take active part in political affairs, and go to the polls  and cast their votes alongside the male sex; but while this would be  a gratification to a large number of very worthy and excellent  ladies who take a different view of the question from that which we  entertain, we feel that it would be a great cruelty to a much larger  number of the cultivated, refined, delicate, and lovely women of  this country who seek no such distinction, who would enjoy no such  privilege, who would with woman-like delicacy shrink from the  discharge of any such obligation, and who would sincerely regret that,  what they consider the folly of the state, had imposed upon them any  such unpleasant duties.    But should female suffrage be once established it would become an  imperative necessity that the very large class, indeed much the  largest class, of the women of this country of the character last  described should yield, contrary to their inclinations and wishes, to  the necessity which would compel them to engage in political strife.  We apprehend no one who has properly considered this question will  doubt if female suffrage should be established that the more ignorant  and less refined portions of the female population of this country,  to say nothing of the baser class of females, laying aside feminine  delicacy and disregarding the sacred duties devolving upon them, to  which we have already referred, would rush to the polls and take  pleasure in the crowded association which the situation would compel,  of the two sexes in political meetings, and at the ballot-box.    If all the baser and more ignorant portion of the female sex crowd to  the polls and deposit their suffrage this compels the very large class  of intelligent, virtuous, and refined females, including wives and  mothers, who have much more important duties to perform, to leave  their sacred labors at home, relinquishing for a time the God-given  important trust which has been placed in their hands, to go contrary  to their wishes to the polls and vote, to counteract the suffrage of  the less worthy class of our female population. If they fail to do  this the best interests of the country must suffer by a preponderance  of ignorance and vice at the polls.    It is now a problem which perplexes the brain of the ablest statesmen  to determine how we will best preserve our republican system as  against the demoralizing influence of the large class of our present  citizens and voters who by reason of their illiteracy are unable to  read or write the ballot they cast.    Certainly no statesman who has carefully observed the situation would  desire to add very largely to this burden of ignorance. But who  does not apprehend the fact if universal female suffrage should be  established that we will, especially in the Southern States, add a  very large number to the voting population whose ignorance utterly  disqualifies them for discharging the trust. If our colored population  who were so recently slaves that even the males who are voters have  had but little opportunity to educate themselves or to be educated,  whose ignorance is now exciting the liveliest interest of our  statesmen, are causes of serious apprehension, what is to be said in  favor of adding to the voting population all the females of that race,  who, on account of the situation in which they have been placed, have  had much less opportunity to be educated than even the males of their  own race.    We do not say it is their fault that they are not educated, but the  fact is undeniable that they are grossly ignorant, with very few  exceptions, and probably not one in a hundred of them could read and  write the ballot that they would be authorized to cast. What says the  statesman to the propriety of adding this immense mass of ignorance to  the voting population of the Union in its present condition?    It may be said that their votes could be offset by the ballots of the  educated and refined ladies of the white race in the same section;  but who does not know that the ignorant female voters would be at  the polls _en masse_, while the refined and educated, shrinking from  public contact on such occasions, would remain at home and attend to  their domestic and other important duties, leaving the country too  often to the control of those who could afford under the circumstances  to take part in the strifes of politics, and to come in contact with  the unpleasant surroundings before they could reach the polls. Are  we ready to expose the country to the demoralization, and our  institutions to the strain, which would be placed upon them for the  gratification of a minority of the virtuous and good of our female  population at the expense of the mortification of a very large  majority of the same sex?    It has been frequently urged with great earnestness by those who  advocate woman suffrage that the ballot is necessary to the women to  enable them to protect themselves in securing occupations, and to  enable them to realize the same compensation for the like labor which  is received by men. This argument is plausible, but upon a closer  examination it will be found to possess but little real force. The  price of labor is and must continue to be governed by the law of  supply and demand, and the person who has the most physical strength  to labor, and the most pursuits requiring such strength open for  employment, will always command the higher prices.    Ladies make excellent teachers in public schools; many of them are  every way the equals of their male competitors, and still they secure  less wages than males. The reason is obvious. The number of ladies who  offer themselves as teachers is much larger than the number of males  who are willing to teach. The larger number of females offer to teach  because other occupations are not open to them. The smaller number of  males offer to teach because other more profitable occupations are  open to most males who are competent to teach. The result is that the  competition for positions of teachers to be filled by ladies is so  great as to reduce the price: but as males can not be employed at  that price, and are necessary in certain places in the schools, those  seeking their services have to pay a higher rate for them.    Persons having a larger number of places open to them with fewer  competitors command higher wages than those who have a smaller number  of places open to them with more competitors. This is the law of  society. It is the law of supply and demand, which can not be changed  by legislation. Then it follows that the ballot can not enable those  who have to compete with the larger number to command the same prices  as those who compete with the smaller number in the labor market. As  the Legislature has no power to regulate in practice that of which  the advocates of woman suffrage complain, the ballot in the hands of  females could not aid its regulation.    The ballot can not impart to the female physical strength which she  does not possess, nor can it open to her pursuits which she does not  have physical ability to engage in; and as long as she lacks the  physical strength to compete with men in the different departments of  labor, there will be more competition in her department, and she must  necessarily receive less wages.    But it is claimed again, that females should have the ballot as a  protection against the tyranny of bad husbands. This is also delusive.  If the husband is brutal, arbitrary, or tyrannical, and tyrannizes  over her at home, the ballot in her hands would be no protection  against such injustice, but the husband who compelled her to conform  to his wishes in other respects would also compel her to use the  ballot, if she possessed it, as he might please to dictate. The ballot  would therefore be of no assistance to the wife in such case, nor  could it heal family strifes or dissensions. On the contrary, one  of the gravest objections to placing the ballot in the hands of the  female sex is that it would promote unhappiness and dissensions in the  family circle. There should be unity and harmony in the family.    At present the man represents the family in meeting the demands of the  law and of society upon the family. So far as the rougher, coarser  duties are concerned, the man represents the family, and the  individuality of the woman is not brought into prominence; but when  the ballot is placed in the hands of woman her individuality is  enlarged, and she is expected to answer for herself the demands of the  law and of society on her individual account, and not as the weaker  member of the family to answer by her husband. This naturally draws  her out from the dignified and cultivated refinement of her womanly  position, and brings her into a closer contact with the rougher  elements of society, which tends to destroy that higher reverence and  respect which her refinement and dignity in the relation of wife  and mother have always inspired in those who approached her in her  honorable and useful retirement.    When she becomes a voter she will be more or less of a politician, and  will form political alliances or unite with political parties which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#8)"],[1,"ere, we'll be ready for  them. If they do not come, we'll call on Mr. Browning.\"    \"I'm afraid this is rather a serious matter,\" said Dismal Jones.    \"Oh, don't begin to croak!\" cried Rattleton. \"Merriwell knows his  business. Hurry up with your makeup. Can't tell how early the sophs will  call.\"    So the boys hastened to complete their disguise, and a decidedly  savage-looking band they were when all was completed. Frank surveyed  them with satisfaction.    \"Ah! my bold warriors!\" he cried. \"I am proud of you.  To-night--to-night we deal the enemy a terrible and deadly blow.\"    \"We're ready to hear what the layout is,\" eagerly said Ned Stover.    \"Well, you are to retire to Robinson's room, which is exactly opposite  this, and wait. I have two fellows outside to let me know when the enemy  approaches and to take a hand in the game at the right time. When I  whistle you are to make your way into this room if you have to break  down the door. That's all.\"    The boys retired to Robinson's room, where they smoked and waited with  great impatience.    Frank sat down and coolly went at his studies.    Nearly an hour passed, and then there was a sound of wheels outside. The  sound stopped before the door.    A few moments later some one ascended the stairs and there came a knock  on the door.    \"Come in,\" called Frank.    The door opened, and Roll Ditson sauntered in, smoking the inevitable  cigarette.    \"Hello, Merry!\" he cried, looking around. \"All alone?\"    \"All alone, Ditson,\" yawned Frank. \"It's beastly stupid but I am having  a hard pull at my studies.\"    \"Better come out with me and get a little air. It's stuffy here.\"    \"Oh, you'll have to excuse me to-night. I don't believe I'll go out.\"    Ditson urged, but Frank persisted in refusing. Roll stopped near a table  and picked up a stick of grease paint.    \"Hello! what's this?\" he exclaimed. \"Aren't going into amateur  theatricals, are you, Merry?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" smiled Frank. \"I may do a turn.\"    Ditson looked at Merriwell curiously, as if in doubt concerning his  sincerity, but Frank simply continued to smile.    \"Indian red,\" said Roll, reading the lettering on the stick. \"You don't  mean to become a big chief, do you?\"    \"Perhaps so.\"    \"Well, you are pretty sure to become a big chief here at Yale, old man,\"  said Ditson, with apparent earnestness. \"You will be a leader here some  day.\"    \"Think so?\"    \"Oh, I am dead sure of it.\"    \"Thank you.\"    Merriwell yawned again.    \"Oh, come on!\" Ditson urged. \"You're stupid from digging over those  books. Come out and have a walk.\"    \"No.\"    \"You won't?\"    \"You'll have to excuse me to-night, Ditson.\"    \"All right. But say, I came near forgetting something. As I came in,  there was a fellow down to the door who said he wanted to see you.\"    \"A fellow? Who was it?\"    \"Don't know. Some of the students, I think.\"    \"Oh, if that is the case, go down and bring him up, Ditson. You can open  the door and let him in without disturbing Mrs. Harrington.\"    \"All right,\" nodded Roll. \"Sorry you won't come out, old fel. You'll get  grouchy. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night.\"    Ditson went out, and Frank heard him descending the stairs.    \"There'll be music in the air,\" muttered Merriwell as he again lay back  in his chair, elevating his feet to the top of the table. \"But the  surprisers are liable to be surprised.\"    He heard the front door creak. Often he wondered why Mrs. Harrington did  not grease the hinges.    Frank had good ears, and it was not long before he was sure he could  hear rustlings and whisperings in the hall. Then one person seemed to  ascend the stairs very slowly, but he made out that there were two or  three others with that one, the others stepping as softly as possible.    Merriwell remained cool and apparently quite unaware that anything  unusual was taking place.    The footsteps reached the head of the stairs and advanced to the door,  on which there was a distinct knock.    \"Come in!\" Frank once more called.    The door was promptly flung open, and into the room strode a person who  was wrapped in a big overcoat and wore a wide-brimmed hat slouched over  his eyes. His face nearly to his eyes was covered with bushy whiskers.    \"Hello!\" exclaimed Frank, as if surprised. \"Who are you?\"    \"'Sh!\" hissed the stranger, with a warning gesture. \"Are we alone?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where is your roommate?\"    \"Out.\"    The fellow whistled sharply, and the next minute four masked lads  appeared at the door and leaped into the room. One of them slammed the  door shut and the others sprang at Frank.    Merriwell flung a book at the first one, and it struck the fellow's  mask, tearing it from his face.    The well-known countenance of Bruce Browning was exposed!    \"Good-evening, Browning!\" cheerfully called the lively freshman as he  darted behind the table. \"I have been expecting a call from you.\"    \"Grab him!\" directed Browning. \"Get hold of him!\"    Frank was on the point of uttering a whistle, but it was not required,  for the whistle that came from the lips of the disguised fellow had  served as a signal to the painted braves.    There was a bang at the door, which flew open as if assaulted by a  catapault, and into the room poured the disguised freshmen.    The Indians leaped upon the masked sophomores, and for a short time a  very sharp struggle took place.    Bruce Browning did his best to escape from the room, but three of the  savages laid hold of him, and he was finally subdued.    \"Out of the house with them as soon as possible,\" ordered Frank. \"Come  on, two or three of you. We must nail the hack and the fellows outside.\"    Down to the door he led the way.    Mrs. Harrington came out into the hall, caught a glimpse of the painted  faces, uttered a wild shriek of terror, and dodged back, slamming the  door.    \"All ready?\" said Frank as he prepared to fling open the front door.    \"All ready!\" panted Harry Rattleton, close behind him.    \"Don't let anybody get away,\" warned Merriwell. \"I will look after the  driver.\"    \"Go ahead.\"    Creak! open swung the door, and out into the night leaped a youth who  seemed to be hotly pursued by four painted and bloodthirsty-appearing  redskins.    The hack was standing exactly as Frank expected it would be, and he was  on the box with the driver at two springs.    \"It's all right,\" he asserted. \"We've got the fellow up there, though he  did kick up some. A part of our gang was rigged up like Indians, and  they nipped him all right.\"    \"It's the divil's own set ye shtudints are!\" muttered the driver. \"Av ye  hurry, Oi'll sthay to take him away; but Oi'll not remain here long, fer  it's th' cops will be down on us roight away.\"    \"We'll get away ahead of the cops, don't fear that,\" declared Frank.  \"They're bringing him downstairs now. We had to take two or three others  with him; but well not bother with them long.\"    \"Arrah! th' poor freshman!\" said the driver. \"Oi'd not loike to be in  his place this noight!\"    He was completely fooled, thinking all the time that Frank was one of  the party he had brought there to capture the freshman.    As they rushed out Frank had seen a fellow standing near the open door  of the hack, and that fellow had promptly taken to flight at sight of  the Indians, two of whom pursued him hotly.    Frank hoped they would be able to overtake the fugitive, for if one of  the party escaped he would report to the sophs, who were bound to make a  big hustle to rescue their captured comrades.    The disguised freshmen came downstairs, bearing their captives, who were  swiftly thrust into the hack, which was a big, roomy, old-fashioned  affair.    As many of the freshmen as could do so piled inside and upon the hack,  and then Frank gave the signal, the driver whipped up his horse and away  they went.    \"East Rock,\" said Frank.    \"Eh?\" exclaimed the driver. \"Thot's not pwhere ye wur goin' in th'  firrust place.\"    \"We have changed the programme. East Rock is where we are bound for  now.\"    \"All roight, me b'y.\"    The triumphant freshmen felt like shouting and singing in jubilant mood.  Indeed, Rattleton could not refrain from \"letting off steam,\" as he  called it, and he gave one wild howl of triumph that made the streets  echo:    \"'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight!\"    \"Break it off!\" sharply commanded Frank. \"Want to let the sophs know  we're up to something?\"    \"I don't care.\"    \"They might raise a rescue party and follow us.\"    \"But they wouldn't frop any chost--I mean chop any frost with us.\"    \"Pwhat's thot?\" came suspiciously from the driver. \"An' is it not  softmores ye are yersilves?\"    \"Of course we are,\" returned Harry, instantly.    \"Thin pwhat fer do ye yell fer 'Umpty-eight?\"    \"Oh, it's a way we have. Don't mind it, but keep on driving if you want  to retain your scalp, paleface. We are mighty bad Injuns!\"    The driver knew how to pick out the darkest and most deserted streets.  By the time the outskirts of the city were reached the freshmen were  bubbling over.    Frank Merriwell improvised a stanza of a song, and in a few moments the  entire band caught the words and the tune. As the hack rolled along  toward East Rock the freshmen sang:      \"We belong to good old 'Umpty-eight,    For she's a corker, sure as fate, sure as fate.      We have met the sophomores,      And they're feeling awful sore;    So hurrah for good old 'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight!\"    \"Begobs! ye're th' quarest gang av softmores Oi iver saw!\" cried the  driver. \"An' it's not wan av yez Oi remimber takin' up to th' freshman's  boording house.\"    \"We have changed,\" explained Ned Stover.    \"And it's the first change I have seen for a week,\" declared Harry  Rattleton. \"I'm waiting to hear from the governor.\"    \"Howld on,\" said the driver. \"Oi want to see the mon thot hired me.\"    He threatened to pull up, but Frank caught the whip and cracked it over  the horses.    \"What do you want?\" asked Merriwell.    \"Oi want"]]]
