[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#8)"],[1,"so strong was the breeze, that we were being driven  down rapidly upon it. And then, just before sunset, we opened out the  end of it, and drew in our oars, very thankful to set the little  foresail, and run off again before the wind.    And so, presently, the night came down upon us, and the bo'sun made us  take turn and turn about to keep a look-out; for the boat was going some  knots through the water, and we were among strange seas; but _he_ took no  sleep all that night, keeping always to the steering oar.    I have memory, during my time of watching, of passing odd floating  masses, which I make no doubt were weed, and once we drove right atop of  one; but drew clear without much trouble. And all the while, through the  dark to starboard, I could make out the dim outline of that enormous weed  extent lying low upon the sea, and seeming without end. And so,  presently, my time to watch being at an end, I returned to my slumber,  and when next I waked it was morning.    Now the morning discovered to me that there was no end to the weed upon  our starboard side; for it stretched away into the distance ahead of us  so far as we could see; while all about us the sea was full of floating  masses of the stuff. And then, suddenly, one of the men cried out that  there was a vessel in among the weed. At that, as may be imagined, we  were very greatly excited, and stood upon the thwarts that we might get  better view of her. Thus I saw her a great way in from the edge of the  weed, and I noted that her foremast was gone near to the deck, and she  had no main topmast; though, strangely enough, her mizzen stood unharmed.  And beyond this, I could make out but little, because of the distance;  though the sun, which was upon our larboard side, gave me some sight of  her hull, but not much, because of the weed in which she was deeply  embedded; yet it seemed to me that her sides were very weather-worn, and  in one place some glistening brown object, which may have been a fungus,  caught the rays of the sun, sending off a wet sheen.    There we stood, all of us, upon the thwarts, staring and exchanging  opinions, and were like to have overset the boat; but that the bo'sun  ordered us down. And after this we made our breakfast, and had much  discussion regarding the stranger, as we ate.    Later, towards midday, we were able to set our mizzen; for the storm had  greatly modified, and so, presently, we hauled away to the West, to  escape a great bank of the weed which ran out from the main body. Upon  rounding this, we let the boat off again, and set the main lug, and thus  made very good speed before the wind. Yet though we ran all that  afternoon parallel with the weed to starboard, we came not to its end.  And three separate times we saw the hulks of rotting vessels, some of  them having the appearance of a previous age, so ancient did they seem.    Now, towards evening, the wind dropped to a very little breeze, so that  we made but slow way, and thus we had better chance to study the weed.  And now we saw that it was full of crabs; though for the most part so  very minute as to escape the casual glance; yet they were not all small,  for in a while I discovered a swaying among the weed, a little way in  from the edge, and immediately I saw the mandible of a very great crab  stir amid the weed. At that, hoping to obtain it for food, I pointed it  out to the bo'sun, suggesting that we should try and capture it. And so,  there being by now scarce any wind, he bade us get out a couple of the  oars, and back the boat up to the weed. This we did, after which he made  fast a piece of salt meat to a bit of spun yarn, and bent this on to the  boat hook. Then he made a running bowline, and slipped the loop on to the  shaft of the boat hook, after which he held out the boat hook, after the  fashion of a fishing rod, over the place where I had seen the crab.  Almost immediately, there swept up an enormous claw, and grasped the  meat, and at that, the bo'sun cried out to me to take an oar and slide  the bowline along the boat-hook, so that it should fall over the claw,  and this I did, and immediately some of us hauled upon the line,  taughtening it about the great claw. Then the bo'sun sung out to us to  haul the crab aboard, that we had it most securely; yet on the instant we  had reason to wish that we had been less successful; for the creature,  feeling the tug of our pull upon it, tossed the weed in all directions,  and thus we had full sight of it, and discovered it to be so great a crab  as is scarce conceivable--a very monster. And further, it was apparent to  us that the brute had no fear of us, nor intention to escape; but rather  made to come at us; whereat the bo'sun, perceiving our danger, cut the  line, and bade us put weight upon the oars, and so in a moment we were in  safety, and very determined to have no more meddlings with such  creatures.    Presently, the night came upon us, and, the wind remaining low, there  was everywhere about us a great stillness, most solemn after the  continuous roaring of the storm which had beset us in the previous days.  Yet now and again a little wind would rise and blow across the sea, and  where it met the weed, there would come a low, damp rustling, so that I  could hear the passage of it for no little time after the calm had come  once more all about us.    Now it is a strange thing that I, who had slept amid the noise of the  past days, should find sleeplessness amid so much calm; yet so it was,  and presently I took the steering oar, proposing that the rest should  sleep, and to this the bo'sun agreed, first warning me, however, most  particularly to have care that I kept the boat off the weed (for we had  still a little way on us), and, further, to call him should anything  unforeseen occur. And after that, almost immediately he fell asleep, as  indeed did the most of the men.    From the time that I relieved the bo'sun, until midnight, I sat upon the  gunnel of the boat, with the steering oar under my arm, and watched and  listened, most full of a sense of the strangeness of the seas into  which we had come. It is true that I had heard tell of seas choked up  with weed--seas that were full of stagnation, having no tides; but I  had not thought to come upon such an one in my wanderings; having,  indeed, set down such tales as being bred of imagination, and without  reality in fact.    Then, a little before the dawn, and when the sea was yet full of  darkness, I was greatly startled to hear a prodigious splash amid the  weed, mayhaps at a distance of some hundred yards from the boat. Then,  as I stood full of alertness, and knowing not what the next moment  might bring forth, there came to me across the immense waste of weed, a  long, mournful cry, and then again the silence. Yet, though I kept very  quiet, there came no further sound, and I was about to re-seat myself,  when, afar off in that strange wilderness, there flashed out a sudden  flame of fire.    Now upon seeing fire in the midst of so much lonesomeness, I was as one  amazed, and could do naught but stare. Then, my judgment returning to me,  I stooped and waked the bo'sun; for it seemed to me that this was a  matter for his attention. He, after staring at it awhile, declared that  he could see the shape of a vessel's hull beyond the flame; but,  immediately, he was in doubt, as, indeed, I had been all the while. And  then, even as we peered, the light vanished, and though we waited for the  space of some minutes; watching steadfastly, there came no further sight  of that strange illumination.    From now until the dawn, the bo'sun remained awake with me, and we talked  much upon that which we had seen; yet could come to no satisfactory  conclusion; for it seemed impossible to us that a place of so much  desolation could contain any living being. And then, just as the dawn was  upon us, there loomed up a fresh wonder--the hull of a great vessel maybe  a couple or three score fathoms in from the edge of the weed. Now the  wind was still very light, being no more than an occasional breath, so  that we went past her at a drift, thus the dawn had strengthened  sufficiently to give to us a clear sight of the stranger, before we had  gone more than a little past her. And now I perceived that she lay full  broadside on to us, and that her three masts were gone close down to the  deck. Her side was streaked in places with rust, and in others a green  scum overspread her; but it was no more than a glance that I gave at any  of those matters; for I had spied something which drew all my  attention--great leathery arms splayed all across her side, some of them  crooked inboard over the rail, and then, low down, seen just above the  weed, the huge, brown, glistening bulk of so great a monster as ever I  had conceived. The bo'sun saw it in the same instant and cried out in a  hoarse whisper that it was a mighty devilfish, and then, even as he  spoke, two of the arms flickered up into the cold light of the dawn, as  though the creature had been asleep, and we had waked it. At that, the  bo'sun seized an oar, and I did likewise, and, so swiftly as we dared,  for fear of making any unneedful noise, we pulled the boat to a safer  distance. From there and until the vessel had become indistinct by reason  of the space we put between us, we watched that great creature clutched  to the old hull, as it might be a limpet to a rock.    Presently, when it was broad day, some of the men began to rouse up, and  in a little we broke our fast, which was not displeasing to me, who had  spent the night watching. And so through the day we sailed with a very  light wind upon our larboard quarter. And all the while we kept the  great waste of weed upon our starboard side, and apart from the mainland  of the weed, as it were, there were scattered about an uncountable  number of weed islets and banks, and there were thin patches of it that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#8)"],[1," form and pencil. I must warn Gussie without delay.  What he's got to do is to create in this girl's mind the impression that  he is pining away for love of her. This cannot be done by wolfing  sausages.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Very well, then.\"    And, taking form and _p._, I drafted the following:    _Fink-Nottle    Brinkley Court,    Market Snodsbury    Worcestershire    Lay off the sausages. Avoid the ham. Bertie._      \"Send that off, Jeeves, instanter.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    I sank back on the pillows.    \"Well, Jeeves,\" I said, \"you see how I am taking hold. You notice the  grip I am getting on this case. No doubt you realize now that it would  pay you to study my methods.\"    \"No doubt, sir.\"    \"And even now you aren't on to the full depths of the extraordinary  sagacity I've shown. Do you know what brought Aunt Dahlia up here this  morning? She came to tell me I'd got to distribute the prizes at some  beastly seminary she's a governor of down at Market Snodsbury.\"    \"Indeed, sir? I fear you will scarcely find that a congenial task.\"    \"Ah, but I'm not going to do it. I'm going to shove it off on to Gussie.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"I propose, Jeeves, to wire to Aunt Dahlia saying that I can't get down,  and suggesting that she unleashes him on these young Borstal inmates of  hers in my stead.\"    \"But if Mr. Fink-Nottle should decline, sir?\"    \"Decline? Can you see him declining? Just conjure up the picture in your  mind, Jeeves. Scene, the drawing-room at Brinkley; Gussie wedged into a  corner, with Aunt Dahlia standing over him making hunting noises. I put  it to you, Jeeves, can you see him declining?\"    \"Not readily, sir. I agree. Mrs. Travers is a forceful personality.\"    \"He won't have a hope of declining. His only way out would be to slide  off. And he can't slide off, because he wants to be with Miss Bassett.  No, Gussie will have to toe the line, and I shall be saved from a job at  which I confess the soul shuddered. Getting up on a platform and  delivering a short, manly speech to a lot of foul school-kids! Golly,  Jeeves. I've been through that sort of thing once, what? You remember  that time at the girls' school?\"    \"Very vividly, sir.\"    \"What an ass I made of myself!\"    \"Certainly I have seen you to better advantage, sir.\"    \"I think you might bring me just one more of those dynamite specials of  yours, Jeeves. This narrow squeak has made me come over all faint.\"    I suppose it must have taken Aunt Dahlia three hours or so to get back to  Brinkley, because it wasn't till well after lunch that her telegram  arrived. It read like a telegram that had been dispatched in a white-hot  surge of emotion some two minutes after she had read mine.    As follows:    _Am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew  counts as murder. If it doesn't look out for yourself. Consider your  conduct frozen limit. What do you mean by planting your loathsome friends  on me like this? Do you think Brinkley Court is a leper colony or what is  it? Who is this Spink-Bottle? Love. Travers._    I had expected some such initial reaction. I replied in temperate vein:    _Not Bottle. Nottle. Regards. Bertie._    Almost immediately after she had dispatched the above heart cry, Gussie  must have arrived, for it wasn't twenty minutes later when I received the  following:    _Cipher telegram signed by you has reached me here. Runs \"Lay off the  sausages. Avoid the ham.\" Wire key immediately. Fink-Nottle._    I replied:    _Also kidneys. Cheerio. Bertie._    I had staked all on Gussie making a favourable impression on his hostess,  basing my confidence on the fact that he was one of those timid,  obsequious, teacup-passing, thin-bread-and-butter-offering yes-men whom  women of my Aunt Dahlia's type nearly always like at first sight. That I  had not overrated my acumen was proved by her next in order, which, I was  pleased to note, assayed a markedly larger percentage of the milk of  human kindness.    As follows:    _Well, this friend of yours has got here, and I must say that for a  friend of yours he seems less sub-human than I had expected. A bit of a  pop-eyed bleater, but on the whole clean and civil, and certainly most  informative about newts. Am considering arranging series of lectures for  him in neighbourhood. All the same I like your nerve using my house as a  summer-hotel resort and shall have much to say to you on subject when you  come down. Expect you thirtieth. Bring spats. Love. Travers._    To this I riposted:    _On consulting engagement book find impossible come Brinkley Court.  Deeply regret. Toodle-oo. Bertie._    Hers in reply stuck a sinister note:    _Oh, so it's like that, is it? You and your engagement book, indeed.  Deeply regret my foot. Let me tell you, my lad, that you will regret it a  jolly sight more deeply if you don't come down. If you imagine for one  moment that you are going to get out of distributing those prizes, you  are very much mistaken. Deeply regret Brinkley Court hundred miles from  London, as unable hit you with a brick. Love. Travers._    I then put my fortune to the test, to win or lose it all. It was not a  moment for petty economies. I let myself go regardless of expense:    _No, but dash it, listen. Honestly, you don't want me. Get Fink-Nottle  distribute prizes. A born distributor, who will do you credit.  Confidently anticipate Augustus Fink-Nottle as Master of Revels on  thirty-first inst. would make genuine sensation. Do not miss this great  chance, which may never occur again. Tinkerty-tonk. Bertie._    There was an hour of breathless suspense, and then the joyful tidings  arrived:    _Well, all right. Something in what you say, I suppose. Consider you  treacherous worm and contemptible, spineless cowardly custard, but have  booked Spink-Bottle. Stay where you are, then, and I hope you get run  over by an omnibus. Love. Travers._    The relief, as you may well imagine, was stupendous. A great weight  seemed to have rolled off my mind. It was as if somebody had been pouring  Jeeves's pick-me-ups into me through a funnel. I sang as I dressed for  dinner that night. At the Drones I was so gay and cheery that there were  several complaints. And when I got home and turned into the old bed, I  fell asleep like a little child within five minutes of inserting the  person between the sheets. It seemed to me that the whole distressing  affair might now be considered definitely closed.    Conceive my astonishment, therefore, when waking on the morrow and  sitting up to dig into the morning tea-cup, I beheld on the tray another  telegram.    My heart sank. Could Aunt Dahlia have slept on it and changed her mind?  Could Gussie, unable to face the ordeal confronting him, have legged it  during the night down a water-pipe? With these speculations racing  through the bean, I tore open the envelope And as I noted contents I  uttered a startled yip.    \"Sir?\" said Jeeves, pausing at the door.    I read the thing again. Yes, I had got the gist all right. No, I had not  been deceived in the substance.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"do you know what?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You know my cousin Angela?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You know young Tuppy Glossop?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"They've broken off their engagement.\"    \"I am sorry to hear that, sir.\"    \"I have here a communication from Aunt Dahlia, specifically stating this.  I wonder what the row was about.\"    \"I could not say, sir.\"    \"Of course you couldn't. Don't be an ass, Jeeves.\"    \"No, sir.\"    I brooded. I was deeply moved.    \"Well, this means that we shall have to go down to Brinkley today. Aunt  Dahlia is obviously all of a twitter, and my place is by her side. You  had better pack this morning, and catch that 12.45 train with the  luggage. I have a lunch engagement, so will follow in the car.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    I brooded some more.    \"I must say this has come as a great shock to me, Jeeves.\"    \"No doubt, sir.\"    \"A very great shock. Angela and Tuppy.... Tut, tut! Why, they seemed like  the paper on the wall. Life is full of sadness, Jeeves.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Still, there it is.\"    \"Undoubtedly, sir.\"    \"Right ho, then. Switch on the bath.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"        -7-      I meditated pretty freely as I drove down to Brinkley in the old  two-seater that afternoon. The news of this rift or rupture of Angela's  and Tuppy's had disturbed me greatly.    The projected match, you see, was one on which I had always looked with  kindly approval. Too often, when a chap of your acquaintance is planning  to marry a girl you know, you find yourself knitting the brow a bit and  chewing the lower lip dubiously, feeling that he or she, or both, should  be warned while there is yet time.    But I have never felt anything of this nature about Tuppy and Angela.  Tuppy, when not making an ass of himself, is a soundish sort of egg. So  is Angela a soundish sort of egg. And, as far as being in love was  concerned, it had always seemed to me that you wouldn't have been far out  in describing them as two hearts that beat as one.    True, they had had their little tiffs, notably on the occasion when  Tuppy--with what he said was fearless honesty and I considered thorough  goofiness--had told Angela that her new hat made her look like a  Pekingese. But in every romance you have to budget for the occasional  dust-up, and after that incident I had supposed that he had learned his  lesson and that from then on life would be one grand, sweet song.    And now this wholly unforeseen severing of diplomatic relations had  popped up through a trap.    I gave the thing the cream of the Wooster brain all the way down, but it  continued to beat me what could have caused the outbreak of hostilities,  and I bunged my foot sedulously on the accelerator in order to get to  Aunt Dahlia with the greatest possible speed and learn the inside history  straight from the horse's mouth. And what with all six cylinders hitting  nicely, I made good time"]]]
