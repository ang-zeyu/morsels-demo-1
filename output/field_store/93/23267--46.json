He paid his scot by  reciting from memory some of his youthful Latin verses, hexameters,  \"molto erudite,\" says the minute-book of the sitting, and others,  which \"I shifted, in the scarcity of boots and conveniences, to patch  up.\" He obtained much credit by these exercises, which, indeed,  deserved it by comparison. He ventured upon the perilous experiment of  offering some compositions in Italian, which, the fastidious Tuscan  ear at least professed to include in those \"encomiums which the  Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the Alps.\"    The author of _Lycidas_ cannot but have been quite aware of the small  poetical merit of such an ode as that which was addressed to him by  Francini. In this ode Milton is the swan of Thames--\"Thames, which,  owing to thee, rivals Boeotian Permessus;\" and so forth. But there is  a genuine feeling, an ungrudging warmth of sympathetic recognition  underlying the trite and tumid panegyric. And Milton may have yielded  to the not unnatural impulse of showing his countrymen, that though  not a prophet in boorish and fanatical England, he had found  recognition in the home of letters and arts. Upon us is forced, by  this their different reception of Milton, the contrast between the  two countries, Italy and England, in the middle of the seventeenth  century. The rude north, whose civilisation was all to come,  concentrating all its intelligence in a violent effort to work off the  ecclesiastical poison from its system, is brought into sharp contrast  with the sweet south, whose civilisation is behind it, and whose  intellect, after a severe struggle, has succumbed to the material  force and organisation of the church.    As soon as the season allowed of it, Milton set forward to Rome,  taking what was then the usual way by Siena. At Rome he spent two  months, occupying himself partly with seeing the antiquities, and  partly with cultivating the acquaintance of natives, and some of the  many foreigners resident in the eternal city. But though he received  much civility, we do not find that he met with the peculiar sympathy  which endeared to him his Tuscan friends. His chief ally was the  German, Lucas Holstenius, a native of Hamburg, who had abjured  Protestantism to become librarian of the Vatican. Holstenius had  resided three years in Oxford, and considered himself bound to repay  to the English scholar some of the attentions he had received himself.  Through Holstenius Milton was presented to the nephew, Francesco  Barberini, who was just then everything in Rome. It was at a concert  at the Barberini palace that Milton heard Leonora Baroni sing. His  three Latin epigrams addressed to this lady, the first singer of  Italy, or of the world at that time, testify to the enthusiasm she  excited in the musical soul of Milton.    Nor are these three epigrams the only homage which Milton paid to  Italian beauty. The susceptible poet, who in the sunless north would  fain have \"sported with the tangles of Neaera's hair,\" could not  behold Neaera herself and the flashing splendour of her eye, unmoved.  Milton proclaims (_Defensio Secunda_) that in all his foreign tour he  had lived clear from all that is disgraceful. But the pudicity of his  behaviour and language covers a soul tremulous with emotion, whose  passion was intensified by the discipline of a chaste intention. Five  Italian pieces among his poems are to the address of another lady,  whose \"majestic movements and love-darting dark brow\" had subdued him.  The charm lay in the novelty of this style of beauty to one who came  from the land of the \"vermeil-tinctur'd cheek\" (_Comus_) and the  \"golden nets of hair\" (_El._ i. 60). No clue has been discovered to  the name of this divinity, or to the occasion on which, Milton saw  her.    Of Milton's impression of Rome there is no record. There are no traces  of special observation in his poetry. The description of the city in  _Paradise Regained_ (iv. 32) has nothing characteristic, and could  have been written by one who had never seen it, and by many as well  as by Milton. We get one glimpse of him by aid of the register of the  English College, as dining there at a \"sumptuous entertainment\" on  30th October, when he met Nicholas Carey, brother of Lord Falkland.  In spite of Sir Henry Wotton's caution, his resoluteness, as A.  Wood calls it, in his religion, besides making the English Jesuits  indignant, caused others, not Jesuits, to withhold civilities. Milton  only tells us himself that the antiquities detained him in Rome about  two months.    At the end of November he went on to Naples. On the road he fell in  with an Eremite friar, who gave him an introduction to the one man in  Naples whom it was important he should know, Giovanni Battista Manso,  Marquis of Villa. The marquis, now seventy-eight, had been for  two generations the Maecenas of letters in Southern Italy. He had  sheltered Tasso in the former generation, and Marini in the latter. It  was the singular privilege of his old age that he should now entertain  a third poet, greater than either. In spite of his years, he was able  to act as cicerone to the young Englishman over the scenes which he  himself, in his _Life of Tasso_, has described with the enthusiasm of  a poet. But even the high-souled Manso quailed before the terrors of  the Inquisition, and apologised to Milton for not having shown him  greater attention, because he would not be more circumspect in the  matter of religion. Milton's Italian journey brings out the two  conflicting strains of feeling which were uttered together in  _Lycidas_, the poet's impressibility by nature, the freeman's  indignation at clerical domination.    The time was now at hand when the latter passion, the noble rage  of freedom, was to suppress the more delicate flower of poetic  imagination. Milton's original scheme had included Sicily and Greece.  The serious aspect of affairs at home compelled him to renounce his  project. \"I considered it dishonourable to be enjoying myself at my  ease in foreign lands, while my countrymen were striking a blow for  freedom.\" He retraced his steps leisurely enough, however, making a  halt of two months in Rome, and again one of two months in Florence.  We find him mentioned in the minutes of the academy of the Svogliati  as having been present at three of their weekly meetings, on the 17th,  24th, and 31st March. But the most noteworthy incident of his second  Florentine residence is his interview with Galileo. He had been unable  to see the veteran martyr of science on his first visit. For though  Galileo was at that time living within the walls, he was kept a close  prisoner by the Inquisition, and not allowed either to set foot  outside his own door, or to receive visits from non-Catholics. In the  spring of 1639, however, he was allowed to go back to his villa at  Gioiello, near Arcetri, and Milton obtained admission to him, old,  frail, and blind, but in full possession of his mental faculty.  There is observable in Milton, as Mr. Masson suggests, a prophetic  fascination of the fancy on the subject of blindness. And the deep  impression left by this sight of \"the Tuscan artist\" is evidenced by  the feeling with which Galileo's name and achievement are imbedded in  _Paradise Lost_.    From Florence, Milton crossed the Apennines by Bologna and Ferrara  to Venice. From this port he shipped for England the books he had  collected during his tour, books curious and rare as they seemed to  Phillips, and among them a chest or two of choice music books. The  month of April was spent at Venice, and bidding farewell to the  beloved land he would never visit again, Milton passed the Alps to  Geneva.    No Englishman's foreign pilgrimage was complete without touching at  this marvellous capital of the reformed faith, which with almost no  resources had successfully braved the whole might of the Catholic  reaction. The only record of Milton's stay at Geneva is the album of a  Neapolitan refugee, to which Milton contributed his autograph, under  date 10th June, 1639, with the following quotation:--                  If virtue feeble were,                Heaven itself would stoop to her.                (From _Comus_).                  Caelum non animum muto, dum trans mare curro.                (From _Horace_.)    But it is probable that he was a guest in the house of one of the  leading pastors, Giovanni Diodati, whose nephew Charles, a physician  commencing practice in London, was Milton's bosom friend. Here Milton  first heard of the death, in the previous August, of that friend. It  was a heavy blow to him, for one of the chief pleasures of being at  home again would have been to pour into a sympathetic Italian ear the  story of his adventures. The sadness of the homeward journey from  Geneva is recorded for us in the _Epitaphium Damonis_. This piece is  an elegy to the memory of Charles Diodati. It unfortunately differs  from the elegy on King in being written in Latin, and is thus  inaccessible to uneducated readers. As to such readers the topic of  Milton's Latin poetry is necessarily an ungrateful subject, I  will dismiss it here with one remark. Milton's Latin verses are  distinguished from most Neo-latin verse by being a vehicle of real  emotion. His technical skill is said to have been surpassed by others;  but that in which he stands alone is, that in these exercises of  imitative art he is able to remain himself, and to give utterance to  genuine passion. Artificial Arcadianism is as much the frame-work of  the elegy on Diodati as it is of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#7)"],[1," a  signboard with writing on it, in a peculiar red and yellow  lettering.    Jurgen paused to decipher this.    \"Read me!\" was written on the signboard: \"read me, and judge if you  understand! So you stopped in your journey because I called,  scenting something unusual, something droll. Thus, although I am  nothing, and even less, there is no one that sees me but lingers  here. Stranger, I am a law of the universe. Stranger, render the law  what is due the law!\"    Jurgen felt cheated. \"A very foolish signboard, indeed! for how can  it be 'a law of the universe', when there is no meaning to it!\" says  Jurgen. \"Why, for any law to be meaningless would not be fair.\"          6.    Showing that Sereda Is Feminine      Then, having snapped his fingers at that foolish signboard, Jurgen  would have turned easterly, toward Bellegarde: but his horse  resisted. The pawnbroker decided to accept this as an omen.    \"Forward, then!\" he said, \"in the name of Koshchei.\" And thereafter  Jurgen permitted the horse to choose its own way.    Thus Jurgen came through a forest, wherein he saw many things not  salutary to notice, to a great stone house like a prison, and he  sought shelter there. But he could find nobody about the place,  until he came to a large hall, newly swept. This was a depressing  apartment, in its chill neat emptiness, for it was unfurnished save  for a bare deal table, upon which lay a yardstick and a pair of  scales. Above this table hung a wicker cage, containing a blue bird,  and another wicker cage containing three white pigeons. And in this  hall a woman, no longer young, dressed all in blue, and wearing a  white towel by way of head-dress was assorting curiously colored  cloths.    She had very bright eyes, with wrinkled lids; and now as she looked  up at Jurgen her shrunk jaws quivered.    \"Ah,\" says she, \"I have a visitor. Good day to you, in your  glittering shirt. It is a garment I seem to recognize.\"    \"Good day, grandmother! I am looking for my wife, whom I suspect to  have been carried off by a devil, poor fellow! Now, having lost my  way, I have come to pass the night under your roof.\"    \"Very good: but few come seeking Mother Sereda of their own accord.\"    Then Jurgen knew with whom he talked: and inwardly he was perturbed,  for all the Leshy are unreliable in their dealings.    So when he spoke it was very civilly. \"And what do you do here,  grandmother?\"    \"I bleach. In time I shall bleach that garment you are wearing. For  I take the color out of all things. Thus you see these stuffs here,  as they are now. Clotho spun the glowing threads, and Lachesis wove  them, as you observe, in curious patterns, very marvelous to see:  but when I am done with these stuffs there will be no more color or  beauty or strangeness anywhere apparent than in so many dishclouts.\"    \"Now I perceive,\" says Jurgen, \"that your power and dominion is more  great than any other power which is in the world.\"    He made a song of this, in praise of the Leshy and their Days, but  more especially in praise of the might of Mother Sereda and of the  ruins that have fallen on Wednesday. To Chetverg and Utornik and  Subbota he gave their due. Pyatinka and Nedelka also did Jurgen  commend for such demolishments as have enregistered their names in  the calendar of saints, no less. Ah, but there was none like Mother  Sereda: hers was the centre of that power which is the Leshy's. The  others did but nibble at temporal things, like furtive mice: she  devastated, like a sandstorm, so that there were many dustheaps  where Mother Sereda had passed, but nothing else.    And so on, and so on. The song was no masterpiece, and would not be  bettered by repetition. But it was all untrammeled eulogy, and the  old woman beat time to it with her lean hands: and her shrunk jaws  quivered, and she nodded her white-wrapped head this way and that  way, with a rolling motion, and on her thin lips was a very proud  and foolish smile.    \"That is a good song,\" says she; \"oh, yes, an excellent song! But  you report nothing of my sister Pandelis who controls the day of the  Moon.\"    \"Monday!\" says Jurgen: \"yes, I neglected Monday, perhaps because she  is the oldest of you, but in part because of the exigencies of my  rhyme scheme. We must let Pandelis go unhymned. How can I remember  everything when I consider the might of Sereda?\"    \"Why, but,\" says Mother Sereda, \"Pandelis may not like it, and she  may take holiday from her washing some day to have a word with you.  However, I repeat, that is an excellent song. And in return for your  praise of me, I will tell you that, if your wife has been carried  off by a devil, your affair is one which Koshchei alone can remedy.  Assuredly, I think it is to him you must go for justice.\"    \"But how may I come to him, grandmother?\"    \"Oh, as to that, it does not matter at all which road you follow.  All highways, as the saying is, lead roundabout to Koshchei. The one  thing needful is not to stand still. This much I will tell you also  for your song's sake, because that was an excellent song, and nobody  ever made a song in praise of me before to-day.\"    Now Jurgen wondered to see what a simple old creature was this  Mother Sereda, who sat before him shaking and grinning and frail as  a dead leaf, with her head wrapped in a common kitchen-towel, and  whose power was so enormous.    \"To think of it,\" Jurgen reflected, \"that the world I inhabit is  ordered by beings who are not one-tenth so clever as I am! I have  often suspected as much, and it is decidedly unfair. Now let me see  if I cannot make something out of being such a monstrous clever  fellow.\"    Jurgen said aloud: \"I do not wonder that no practising poet ever  presumed to make a song of you. You are too majestical. You frighten  these rhymesters, who feel themselves to be unworthy of so great a  theme. So it remained for you to be appreciated by a pawnbroker,  since it is we who handle and observe the treasures of this world  after you have handled them.\"    \"Do you think so?\" says she, more pleased than ever. \"Now, may be  that was the way of it. But I wonder that you who are so fine a poet  should ever have become a pawnbroker.\"    \"Well, and indeed, Mother Sereda, your wonder seems to me another  wonder: for I can think of no profession better suited to a retired  poet. Why, there is the variety of company! for high and low and  even the genteel are pressed sometimes for money: then the plowman  slouches into my shop, and the duke sends for me privately. So the  people I know, and the bits of their lives I pop into, give me a  deal to romance about.\"    \"Ah, yes, indeed,\" says Mother Sereda, wisely, \"that well may be the  case. But I do not hold with romance, myself.\"    \"Moreover, sitting in my shop, I wait there quiet-like while tribute  comes to me from the ends of earth: everything which men and women  have valued anywhere comes sooner or later to me: and jewels and  fine knickknacks that were the pride of queens they bring me, and  wedding rings, and the baby's cradle with his little tooth marks on  the rim of it, and silver coffin-handles, or it may be an old  frying-pan, they bring me, but all comes to Jurgen. So that just to  sit there in my dark shop quiet-like, and wonder about the history  of my belongings and how they were made mine, is poetry, and is the  deep and high and ancient thinking of a god who is dozing among what  time has left of a dead world, if you understand me, Mother Sereda.\"    \"I understand: oho, I understand that which pertains to gods, for a  sufficient reason.\"    \"And then another thing, you do not need any turn for business:  people are glad to get whatever you choose to offer, for they would  not come otherwise. So you get the shining and rough-edged coins  that you can feel the proud king's head on, with his laurel-wreath  like millet seed under your fingers; and you get the flat and  greenish coins that are smeared with the titles and the chins and  hooked noses of emperors whom nobody remembers or cares about any  longer: all just by waiting there quiet-like, and making a favor of  it to let customers give you their belongings for a third of what  they are worth. And that is easy labor, even for a poet.\"    \"I understand: I understand all labor.\"    \"And people treat you a deal more civilly than any real need is,  because they are ashamed of trafficking with you at all: I dispute  if a poet could get such civility shown him in any other profession.  And finally, there is the long idleness between business interviews,  with nothing to do save sit there quiet-like and think about the  queerness of things in general: and that is always rare employment  for a poet, even without the tatters of so many lives and homes  heaped up about him like spillikins. So that I would say in all,  Mother Sereda, there is certainly no profession better suited to an  old poet than the profession of pawnbroking.\"    \"Certainly, there may be something in what you tell me,\" observes  Mother Sereda. \"I know what the Little Gods are, and I know what  work is, but I do not think about these other matters, nor about  anything else. I bleach.\"    \"Ah, and a great deal more I could be saying, too, godmother, but  for the fear of wearying you. Nor would I have run on at all about  my private affairs were it not that we two are so close related. And  kith makes kind, as people say.\"    \"But how can you and I be kin?\"    \"Why, heyday, and was I not born upon a Wednesday? That makes you my  godmother, does it not?\"    \"I do not know, dearie, I am sure. Nobody ever cared to claim kin  with Mother Sereda before this,\" says she, pathetically.    \"There can be no doubt, though, on the point, no possible doubt.  Sabellius states it plainly. Artemidorus Minor, I grant you, holds  the question debatable, but his reasons for doing so are tolerably  notorious. Besides, what does all his flimsy sophistry avail against  Nicanor's fine"]]]
