And  Singh Chando said, \"When you buy a bullock first put your hand on  its quarter and if it shrinks and tries to get free, buy it; and when  you want a wife enquire first as to the character of her father and  mother; good parents make good children.\" Then the youth asked about  the two men he had met; Singh Chando said;--\"Tell the first man when  he is ploughing to plough two or three furrows beyond the boundary  of his field and his wealth will diminish and tell the second man to  drive away three or four of his cattle every day and their number  will decrease.\" So the youth returned and met the man who had too  many cattle and told him what Chando had said, and the man thought  \"If I drive away three or four head of cattle every day I shall soon  become poor\" so from that time he looked out for any straying cattle  and would drive them home with his own; if the owner claimed them,  he gave them up, but if no claimant appeared, he kept them and so  he became richer than ever. And the youth went on and met the man  who was too rich, and when he heard what Chando had said he thought  \"If I plough over the boundary on to my neighbour's land it will  be a great sin and I shall soon become poor;\" and he went to his  ploughmen and told them never to plough right up to the edge of the  field but to leave two of three furrows space, and they obeyed and  from that time he grew richer than ever. And the youth returned to  his mother and told her all that had happened and they understood  the meaning of the advice which Chando had given to the two men and  acted accordingly. And it is true that we see that avaricious men  who trespass across boundaries become poor.          XII. The Changed Calf.    There was once a cowherd named Sona who saved a few rupees and he  decided to buy a calf so as to have something to show for his labours;  and he went to a distant village and bought a bull calf and on the way  home he was benighted. So he turned into a Hindu village and went to an  oilman's house and asked to be allowed to sleep there. When the oilman  saw such a fine calf he coveted it and he told Sona to put it in the  stable along with his own bullock and he gave him some supper and let  him sleep in the verandah. But in the middle of the night the oilman  got up and moistened some oil cake and plastered it over the calf;  he then untied his own bullock and made it lick the oil cake off the  calf, and as the bullock was accustomed to eat oil cake it licked it  greedily; then the oilman raised a cry, \"The bullock that turns the  oil mill has given birth to a calf.\" And all the villagers collected,  and saw the bullock licking the calf and they believed the oilman. Sona  did not wake up and knew nothing of all this, the next morning he  got up and went to untie his calf and drive it away, but the oilman  would not let him and claimed the calf as his own. Then Sona called  the villagers to come and decide the matter: but they said that they  had seen him bring no calf to the village and he had not called any of  them to witness it, but they _had_ seen the bullock licking the calf;  why should the bullock lick any but its own calf? No one ever saw a  bullock lick a strange bullock or cow and so they awarded the calf  to the oilman. Then Sona said that he would call someone to argue the  matter and he went away meaning to get some men from the next village:  but he lost his way in the jungle and as he went along a night-jar  flew up from under his feet; he called out to it to stay as he was in  great distress, and the bird alighted and asked what was the matter,  and Sona told it his trouble. Then the night-jar said that it would  argue the matter for him but it must have a colleague and it told Sona  to go on and ask the first living being he met to help; so he went on  and met a jackal and the jackal agreed to help the night-jar, and they  told him to call the villagers to the edge of the jungle and not to  let them bring any dogs with them. So Sona brought all the villagers  to the jungle and the night-jar and jackal sat side by side on a stone.    Then Sona asked the villagers whether they would let him take away  the calf or no, and they persisted in their previous opinion. At last  one man said, \"What are your advocates doing? it seems to me that they  are asleep.\" And at this the two woke up with a start and looked about  them, and the night-jar said \"I have been asleep and dreamed a dream:  will you men please hear it and explain its meaning?\"    And the jackal said, \"I too have had a dream, please explain it for  me. If you can explain the meaning you shall keep the calf and, if  not, the boy shall have it.\" The villagers told them to speak and the  night-jar said, \"I saw two night-jar's eggs and one egg was sitting  on the other; no mother bird was sitting on them, tell me what this  means.\" And the jackal said, \"I saw that the sea was on fire and the  fishes were all being burnt up, and I was busy eating them and that  was why I did not wake up, what is the meaning of this dream?\" And  the villagers said. \"The two dreams are both alike: neither has  any meaning; an egg cannot sit on an egg, and the sea cannot catch  fire.\" The jackal said, \"Why cannot it be? If you won't believe that  water can catch fire why do you say that a bullock gave birth to  a calf? Have you ever seen such a thing? Speak,\" And they admitted  that they had never seen a bullock have a calf, but only cows. \"Then,\"  said the jackal, \"explain why you have given the oilman a decree.\" And  they admitted that they were wrong and awarded the calf to Sona and  fined the oilman five rupees for having deceived them.          XIII. The Koeri and the Barber.    There was a well-to-do man of the Koeri (cultivating) caste and  opposite his house lived a barber who was very poor; and the barber  thought that if he carried on his cultivation just as the Koeri did he  might get better results; so every day he made some pretext to visit  the Koeri's house and hear what work he was going to do the next day,  and with the same object he would listen outside his house at night;  and he exactly imitated the Koeri: he yoked his cattle and unyoked  them, he ploughed and sowed and transplanted just when the Koeri did  and the result was good, for that year he got a very fine crop. But he  was not content with this and resolved to continue to copy the Koeri;  the Koeri suspected what the barber was doing and did not like it. So  he resolved to put the matter to the test and at the same time teach  the barber to mind his own business. In January they both planted  sugar cane, and one day when the crop was half grown the barber  was sitting at the Koeri's house and the Koeri gave orders to his  servants to put the leveller over the crop the next day and break it  down; this was only a pretence of the Koeri's, but the barber went  away and the next day crushed his sugar cane crop with the leveller,  the whole village laughed to see what he had done; but it turned out  that each root of the barber's sugar cane sent up a number of shoots  and in the end he had a much heavier crop than the Koeri.    Another day the Koeri announced that he was going to sow _but_ (pulse)  and therefore ordered his servants to bring out the seed and roast  it well, that it might germinate quickly; and the barber hearing this  went off and had his seed _but_ roasted and the next day he sowed it,  but only a very few seeds germinated, while the crop of the Koeri  which had not really been roasted sprouted finely. The barber asked  the Koeri why his crop had not come up well, and the Koeri told him  that it must be because he had not roasted the seed enough; the few  seeds that had come up must have been those which had been roasted  most. But in the end the laugh was against the Koeri, for the few  seeds of the barber's which germinated, produced such fine plants  that when he came to thresh them out he had more grain than the Koeri,  and so in 3 or 4 years the barber became the richer man of the two.          XIV. The Prince Who Acquired Wisdom.    There was once a Raja who had an only son and the Raja was always  urging his son to learn to read and write in order that when he came  to his kingdom he might manage well and be able to decide disputes  that were brought to him for judgment; but the boy paid no heed to  his father's advice and continued to neglect his lessons. At last  when he was grown up, the Prince saw that his father was right and  he resolved to go away to foreign countries to acquire wisdom; so he  set off without telling anyone but his wife, and he took with him  a purse of money and three pieces of gold. After travelling a long  time, he one day saw a man ploughing in a field and he went and got  some tobacco from him and asked him whether there were any wise men  living in that neighbourhood. \"What do you want with wise men?\",  asked the ploughman. The Prince said that he was travelling to get  wisdom. The ploughman said that he would give him instruction if  he were paid. Then the Prince promised to give him one gold piece  for each piece of wisdom. The ploughman agreed and said. \"Listen  attentively! My first maxim is this: You are the son of a Raja;  whenever you go to visit a friend or one of your subjects and they  offer you a bedstead, or stool, or mat to sit on, do not sit down  at once but move the stool or mat a little to one side; this is  one maxim: give me my gold coin.\" So the Prince paid him. Then the  ploughman said. \"The second maxim is this: You are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1," in  the year 228 B.C., and it was with terror found that the Gauls would  twice take possession of the soil of Rome.  On the advice of the priests,  there was dug within the city, in the middle of the cattle-market, a huge  pit, in which two Gauls, a man and a woman, were entombed alive; for thus  they took possession of the soil of Rome, the oracle was fulfilled, and  the mishap averted.  Thirteen years afterwards, on occasion of the  disaster at Cann, the same atrocity was again committed, at the same  place and for the same cause.  And by a strange contrast, there was at  the committing of this barbarous act, \"which was against Roman usage,\"  says Livy, a secret feeling of horror, for, to appease the manes of the  victims, a sacrifice was instituted, which was celebrated every year at  the pit, in the month of November.    In spite of sometimes urgent peril, in spite of popular alarms, Rome,  during the course of this period, from 299 to 258 B.C., maintained an  increasing ascendency over the Gauls.  She always cleared them off her  territory, several times ravaged theirs, on the two banks of the Po,--  called respectively Transpadan and Cispadan Gaul, and gained the majority  of the great battles she had to fight.  Finally in the year 283 B.C., the  proprietor Drusus, after having ravaged the country of the Senonic Gauls,  carried off the very ingots and jewels, it was said, which had been given  to their ancestors as the price of their retreat.  Solemn proclamation  was made that the ransom of the Capitol had returned within its walls;  and, sixty years afterwards, the Consul M. Cl. Marcellus, having defeated  at Clastidium a numerous army of Gauls, and with his own hand slain their  general, Virdumar, had the honor of dedicating to the temple of Jupiter  the third \"grand spoils\" taken since the foundation of Rome, and of  ascending the Capitol, himself conveying the armor of Virdumar, for he  had got hewn an oaken trunk, round which he had arranged the helmet,  tunic, and breastplate of the barbarian king.    Nor was war Rome's only weapon against her enemies.  Besides the ability  of her generals and the discipline of her legions, she had the sagacity  of her Senate.  The Gauls were not wanting in intelligence or dexterity,  but being too free to go quietly under a master's hand, and too barbarous  for self-government, carried away, as they were, by the interest or  passion of the moment, they could not long act either in concert or with  sameness of purpose.  Far-sightedness and the spirit of persistence were,  on the contrary, the familiar virtues of the Roman Senate.  So soon as  they had penetrated Cisalpine Gaul, they labored to gain there a  permanent footing, either by sowing dissension amongst the Gallic  peoplets that lived there, or by founding Roman colonies.  In the year  283 B.C., several Roman families arrived, with colors flying and under  the guidance of three triumvirs or commissioners, on a territory to the  north-east, on the borders of the Adriatic.  The triumvirs had a round  hole dug, and there deposited some fruits and a handful of earth brought  from Roman soil; then yoking to a plough, having a copper share, a white  bull and a white heifer, they marked out by a furrow a large enclosure.  The rest followed, flinging within the line the ridges thrown up by the  plough.  When the line was finished, the bull and the heifer were  sacrificed with due pomp.  It was a Roman colony come to settle at Sena,  on the very site of the chief town of those Senonic Gauls who had been  conquered and driven out.  Fifteen years afterwards another Roman colony  was founded at Ariminum (Rimini), on the frontier of the Bolan Gauls.  Fifty years later still two others, on the two banks of the Po, Cremona  and Placentia (Plaisance).  Rome had then, in the midst of her enemies,  garrisons, magazines of arms and provisions, and means of supervision and  communication.  Thence proceeded at one time troops, at another  intrigues, to carry dismay or disunion amongst the Gauls.    Towards the close of the third century before our era, the triumph of  Rome in Cisalpine Gaul seemed nigh to accomplishment, when news arrived  that the Romans' most formidable enemy, Hannibal, meditating a passage  from Africa into Italy by Spain and Gaul, was already at work, by his  emissaries, to insure for his enterprise the concurrence of the  Transalpine and Cisalpine Gauls.  The Senate ordered the envoys they had  just then at Carthage to traverse Gaul on returning, and seek out allies  there against Hannibal.  The envoys halted amongst the Gallo-Iberian  peoplets who lived at the foot of the eastern Pyrenees.  There, in the  midst of the warriors assembled in arms, they charged them in the name of  the great and powerful Roman people, not to suffer the Carthaginians to  pass through their territory.  Tumultuous laughter arose at a request  that appeared so strange.  \"You wish us,\" was the answer, \"to draw down  war upon ourselves to avert it from Italy, and to give our own fields  over to devastation to save yours.  We have no cause to complain of the  Carthaginians or to be pleased with the Romans, or to take up arms for  the Romans and against the Carthaginians.  We, on the contrary, hear that  the Roman people drive out from their lands, in Italy, men of our nation,  impose tribute upon them, and make them undergo other indignities.\"  So  the envoys of Rome quitted Gaul without allies.    Hannibal, on the other hand, did not meet with all the favor and all the  enthusiasm he had anticipated.  Between the Pyrenees and the Alps several  peoplets united with him; and several showed coldness, or even hostility.  In his passage of the Alps the mountain tribes harassed him incessantly.  Indeed, in Cisalpine Gaul itself there was great division and hesitation;  for Rome had succeeded in inspiring her partisans with confidence and her  enemies with fear.  Hannibal was often obliged to resort to force even  against the Gauls whose alliance he courted, and to ravage their lands in  order to drive them to take up arms.  Nay, at the conclusion of an  alliance, and in the very camp of the Carthaginians, the Gauls sometimes  hesitated still, and sometimes rose against Hannibal, accused him of  ravaging their country, and refused to obey his orders.  However, the  delights of victory and of pillage at last brought into full play the  Cisalpine Gauls' natural hatred of Rome.  After Ticinus and Trebia,  Hannibal had no more zealous and devoted troops.  At the battle of Lake  Trasimene he lost fifteen hundred men, nearly all Gauls; at that of  Canine he had thirty thousand of them, forming two thirds of his army;  and at the moment of action they cast away their tunics and checkered  cloaks (similar to the plaids of the Gals or Scottish Highlanders), and  fought naked from the belt upwards, according to their custom when they  meant to conquer or die.  Of five thousand five hundred men that the  victory of Cannae cost Hannibal, four thousand were Gauls.  All Cisalpine  Gaul was moved; enthusiasm was at its height; new bands hurried off to  recruit the army of the Carthaginian who, by dint of patience and genius,  brought Rome within an ace of destruction, with the assistance almost  entirely of the barbarians he had come to seek at her gates, and whom he  had at first found so cowed and so vacillating.    When the day of reverses came, and Rome had recovered her ascendency,  the Gauls were faithful to Hannibal; and when at length he was forced to  return to Africa, the Gallic bands, whether from despair or attachment,  followed him thither.  In the year 200 B.C., at the famous battle of  Zama, which decided matters between Rome and Carthage, they again formed  a third of the Carthaginian army, and showed that they were, in the words  of Livy, \"inflamed by that innate hatred towards the Romans which is  peculiar to their race.\"    This was the third period of the struggle between the Gauls and the  Romans in Italy.  Rome, well advised by this terrible war of the danger  with which she was ever menaced by the Cisalpine Gauls, formed the  resolution of no longer restraining them, but of subduing them and  conquering their territory.  She spent thirty years (from 200 to 170  B.C.) in the execution of this design, proceeding by means of war, of  founding Roman colonies, and of sowing dissension amongst the Gallic  peoplets.  In vain did the two principal, the Boians and the Insubrians,  endeavor to rouse and rally all the rest: some hesitated; some absolutely  refused, and remained neutral.  The resistance was obstinate.  The Gauls,  driven from their fields and their towns, established themselves, as  their ancestors had done, in the forests, whence they emerged only to  fall furiously upon the Romans.  And then, if the engagement were  indecisive, if any legions wavered, the Roman centurions hurled their  colors into the midst of the enemy, and the legionaries dashed on at all  risks to recover them.  At Parma and Bologna, in the towns taken from the  Gauls, Roman colonies came at once and planted them-selves.  Day by day  did Rome advance.  At length, in the year 190 B.C., the wrecks of the one  hundred and twelve tribes which had formed the nation of the Boians,  unable any longer to resist, and unwilling to submit, rose as one man,  and departed from Italy.    The Senate, with its usual wisdom, multiplied the number of Roman  colonies in the conquered territory, treated with moderation the tribes  that submitted, and gave to Cisalpine Gaul the name of the Cisalpine or  Hither Gallic Province, which was afterwards changed for that of Gallia  Togata or Roman Gaul.  Then, declaring that nature herself had placed the  Alps between Gaul and Italy as an insurmountable barrier, the Senate  pronounced \"a curse on whosoever should attempt to cross it.\"          CHAPTER III.----THE ROMANS IN GAUL.
