The  church law was based on the Roman law, but was called _canon_ law,  the technical word, because it is the \"canons\" of the church. It is a  convenient term to distinguish it from the ordinary civil law of the  Continent. So that the Constitutions of Clarendon began what was  completed only under Henry VIII; they very clearly asserted the claim  of the king to be supreme over the Church of England. The Bishop of  Rome, as Henry VIII called the pope, had no more power than any other  foreign bishop.[2] There still remained the institution known as  benefit of clergy, by which any priest, or later any clerk or cleric  (which word came to mean any one who could read and write) could  get off of any criminal accusation, at first even murder, by simply  pleading his clergy; in which case the worst that could happen to him  was that he was branded in the right hand. But the Constitutions of  Clarendon were a great step toward civil liberty. Taken by us in 1164,  it was followed in so neighboring a country as France only so late as  a few years ago. The priests, however, still managed to retain their  jurisdiction over offences among themselves, as well as over marriage,  the relation between the sexes, slander, usury, and wills--of matters  relating to the sacraments, and of sins.    [Footnote 1: Stubbs, p. 136.]    [Footnote 2: Yet \"Peter's Pence\" were initiated by Ini, King of the  West Saxons, about 690!]    Now this is a very interesting matter, and were it borne in mind by  our modern legislators they would escape a good deal of unintelligent  legislation; that is, the distinction between a sin and a crime. A sin  is against the church, or against one's conscience; matter, therefore,  for the priest, or one's spiritual adviser. A crime is an offence  against other men; that is, against the state, in which all are  concerned. Under the intelligent legislation of the twelfth century  all matters which were _sins_, which concerned the conscience, were  left to the church to prevent or punish. For the same reason usury was  matter for the priest--because it was regarded under the doctrines  of the Bible as a sin. This notion prevailed down to the early  legislation of the colony of Massachusetts, though doubtless many  things which were then considered sins would now be regarded  as crimes, such as bigamy, for instance. The distinction is,  nevertheless, a valid one, and we shall have occasion frequently to  refer to it. We shall find that the defect of much of our modern  legislation--prohibition laws, for instance--is that they attempt to  treat as crimes, as offences against the state, matters which are  merely sins, offences against the conscience or the individual who  commits them.    To-day, the American constitutions all say that a militia is the  natural defence of a state of free men. It is interesting; therefore,  to find, hardly a century after the Norman Conquest. In 1181, the  Assize of Arms, which revived the ancient Saxon \"Fyrd,\" the word for  what we now call militia; and, twenty years before that, \"scutage\"  replaced military service. To the burdens of the feudal system,  compulsory military service and standing armies, our ancestors  objected from the very beginning. In a sense, scutage was the  beginning of taxation; but it was only a commutation for military  service, much as a man to-day might pay a substitute to go to war in  times of draft. General taxation first appears in 1188 in the famous  Saladin tithe, the first historical instance of the taxation of  personal property as distinct from a feudal burden laid upon land.  The object of this tax was to raise money for the crusade against  the Sultan Saladin. It was followed, five years later, by a tax of  one-fourth of every person's revenue or goods to ransom the king,  Richard I having gone to this crusade against Saladin, and been  captured on his return by his good friend and Christian ally, the  Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is interesting to note that the  worth of the king in those days was considered exactly one-fourth of  the common wealth of England. John was less expensive; but he was not  captured. He levied a tax ten years later of one-seventh part on the  barons, and one-thirteenth on every man.    In 1213 two important things happened. The high-water mark of  domination by the Roman Church is reached when King John surrendered  England to the pope, and took it back as a fief of the pope for a  tribute of one thousand marks. The same year the other early method  of trial of lawsuits was abolished by the Lateran Council--trial by  ordeal. This was the only remaining Saxon method. The Norman trial by  battle had already been superseded by trial by jury; and from this  time on, in practice, no other method than a jury remains, though  trial by battle was not abolished by statute until the nineteenth  century.    And then we come to Magna Charta. The first time it was granted was in  1215 by John, but the charter always quoted is that promulgated ten  years later under Henry III. They were very nearly identical, but the  important omission in the charter of Henry was in regard to \"scutage\"  (\"no aid other than the three customary feudal aids shall be imposed  without the common counsel of the kingdom\"); that, of course, is the  principle we have discussed above, first put in writing in the charter  of John. The barons claimed it as part of the unwritten law. But Henry  III in his charter cannily dropped it out--which is a trick still  played by legislatures to-day. This Magna Charta was confirmed and  ratified something like thirty times between the time of its adoption  under John and the time it got established so completely that it  wasn't necessary to ratify it any more. There are four sections of  Magna Charta that are most important. Chapter 7, the establishment of  the widow's dower; of no great importance to us except as showing  how early the English law protected married women in their property  rights. Chapter 13 confirmed the liberties and customs of London and  other cities and seaports--which is interesting as showing how early  the notion of free trade prevailed among our ancestors. It gave  rise to an immense deal of commercial law, which has always existed  independent of any act of Parliament. Chapter 17 provided that the  common pleas court--that is, the ordinary trial court--should not  follow the king about, but be held at a place and time certain. That  was the beginning of our legal liberty; because before that the king  used to travel about his realm with his justiciar, as they called his  chief legal officer, and anybody who wanted to have a lawsuit had  to travel around England and get the king to hear his case. But the  uncertainty of such a thing made justice very difficult, so it was a  great step when the leading court of the kingdom was to be held in a  place certain, which was at once established in Westminster. Minor  courts were, of course, later established in various counties, though  usually the old Saxon county or hundred-motes continued to exist.  Chapter 12 is the one relating to scutage, from the word _scutum_,  shield--meaning the service of armed men. Just as, to-day, a man who  does not pay his taxes can in some States work them out on the road,  so conversely in England they very early commuted the necessity of  a knight or land-owner furnishing so many armed men into a money  payment. \"The three customary feudal aids\" were for the defence of the  kingdom, the building of forts, and the building of bridges--all  the taxes usually imposed upon English citizens in these earliest  times--all other taxation to be only by the Common Council of the  kingdom. This is the first word, council; later, it became \"consent\";  the word _conseil_ meaning both consent and council. \"Council of  England\" means, of course, the Great Council. We are still before the  time when the word Parliament was used. Thus Magna Charta expresses it  that there should be no taxation without \"the advice\" of Parliament,  without legislation; and as Parliament was a representative body, it  is the equivalent of \"taxation without representation.\" This also was  omitted in Henry III's charter, 1217, and only restored under Edward  I in 1297, a most significant omission. And it is also expressed in  early republications of the Great Charter that taxation must be for  the benefit of _all_, \"for public purposes only,\" for the people  and not for a class. On this latter principle of Anglo-American  constitutional law one of our great political parties bases its  objection to the protective tariff, or to bounties; as, for instance,  to the sugar manufacturers; or other modern devices for extorting  wealth from all the people and giving it to the few. All taxation  shall be for the _common_ benefit. Any taxation imposed for the sole  benefit of the land-owning class, for instance, or even for  the manufacturing class, is against the original principles of  constitutional liberty.    Then we come to chapter 39, the great \"Liberty\" statute. \"No freeman  shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseised of his freehold or _his  liberties or his free customs_ [these important words added in 1217]  or be outlawed or exiled or otherwise destroyed but by lawful judgment  of his peers, or by the law of the land.\" This, the right to law, is  the cornerstone of personal liberty. Any government in any country on  the Continent can seize a man and keep him as long as it likes; it is  only Anglo-Saxons that have an absolute right not to have that happen  to them, and not only are they entitled not to be imprisoned, but  their liberty of free locomotion may not be impeded. An American  citizen has a constitutional right to travel freely through the  whole republic and also not to be excluded therefrom.

Such  knowledge is of first importance in the education of cooks and  housekeepers, since to them falls the selection of the food for the  daily needs of the household; and they should not only understand what  foods are best suited to supply these needs, but how to combine them in  accordance with physiological laws.    CONDIMENTS.--By condiments are commonly meant such substances as  are added to season food, to give it \"a relish\" or to stimulate  appetite, but which in themselves possess no real food value. To this  category belong mustard, ginger, pepper, pepper sauce, Worcestershire  sauce, cloves, spices, and other similar substances. That anything is  needed to disguise or improve the natural flavor of food, would seem to  imply either that the article used was not a proper alimentary  substance, or that it did not answer the purpose for which the Creator  designed it. True condiments, such as pepper, pepper sauce, ginger,  spice, mustard, cinnamon, cloves, etc., are all strong irritants. This  may be readily demonstrated by their application to a raw surface. The  intense smarting and burning occasioned are ample evidence of the  irritating character. Pepper and mustard are capable of producing  powerfully irritating effects, even when applied to the healthy skin  where wholly intact. It is surprising that it does not occur to the  mother who applies a mustard plaster to the feet of her child, to  relieve congestion of the brain, that an article which is capable of  producing a blister upon the external covering of the body, is quite as  capable of producing similar effects when applied to the more sensitive  tissues within the body. The irritating effects of these substances upon  the stomach are not readily recognized, simply because the stomach is  supplied with very few nerves of sensation. That condiments induce an  intense degree of irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach, was  abundantly demonstrated by the experiments of Dr. Beaumont upon the  unfortunate Alexis St. Martin. Dr. Beaumont records that when St. Martin  took mustard, pepper, and similar condiments with his food, the mucous  membrane of his stomach became intensely red and congested, appearing  very much like an inflamed eye. It is this irritating effect of  condiments which gives occasion for their extended use. They create an  artificial appetite, similar to the incessant craving of the chronic  dyspeptic, whose irritable stomach is seldom satisfied. This fact with  regard to condiments is a sufficient argument against their use, being  one of the greatest causes of gluttony, since they remove the sense of  satiety by which Nature says, \"Enough.\"    To a thoroughly normal and unperverted taste, irritating condiments of  all sorts are very obnoxious. It is true that Nature accommodates  herself to their use with food to such a degree that they may be  employed for years without apparently producing very grave results; but  this very condition is a source of injury, since it is nothing more nor  less than the going to sleep of the sentinels which nature has posted at  the portal of the body, for the purpose of giving warning of danger. The  nerves of sensibility have become benumbed to such a degree that they no  longer offer remonstrance against irritating substances, and allow the  enemy to enter into the citadel of life. The mischievous work is thus  insidiously carried on year after year until by and by the individual  breaks down with some chronic disorder of the liver, kidneys, or some  other important internal organ. Physicians have long observed that in  tropical countries where curry powder and other condiments are very  extensively used, diseases of the liver, especially acute congestion and  inflammation, are exceedingly common, much more so that in countries and  among nations where condiments are less freely used. A traveler in  Mexico, some time ago, described a favorite Mexican dish as composed of  layers of the following ingredients: \"Pepper, mustard, ginger, pepper,  potato, ginger; mustard, pepper, potato, mustard, ginger, pepper.\" The  common use of such a dish is sufficient cause for the great frequency of  diseases of the liver among the Mexicans, noted by physicians traveling  in that country. That the use of condiments is wholly a matter of habit  is evident from the fact that different nations employ as condiments  articles which would be in the highest degree obnoxious to people of  other countries. For example, the garlic so freely used in Russian  cookery, would be considered by Americans no addition to the natural  flavors of food; and still more distasteful would be the asafetida  frequently used as a seasoning in the cuisine of Persia and other  Asiatic countries.    The use of condiments is unquestionably a strong auxiliary to the  formation of a habit of using intoxicating drinks. Persons addicted to  the use of intoxicating liquors are, as a rule, fond of stimulating and  highly seasoned foods; and although the converse is not always true, yet  it is apparent to every thoughtful person, that the use of a diet  composed of highly seasoned and irritating food, institutes the  conditions necessary for the acquirement of a taste for intoxicating  liquors. The false appetite aroused by the use of food that \"burns and  stings,\" craves something less insipid than pure cold water to keep up  the fever the food has excited. Again, condiments, like all other  stimulants, must be continually increased in quantity, or their effect  becomes diminished; and this leads directly to a demand for stronger  stimulants, both in eating and drinking, until the probable tendency is  toward the dram-shop.    A more serious reason why high seasonings leads to intemperance, is in  the perversion of the use of the sense of taste. Certain senses are  given us to add to our pleasure as well as for the practical, almost  indispensable, use they are to us. For instance, the sense of sight is  not only useful, but enables us to drink in beauty, if among beautiful  surroundings, without doing us any harm. The same of music and other  harmonics which may come to us through the sense of hearing. But the  sense of taste and was given us to distinguish between wholesome and  unwholesome foods, and cannot be used for merely sensuous gratification,  without debasing and making of it a gross thing. An education which  demands special enjoyment or pleasure through the sense of taste, is  wholly artificial; it is coming down to the animal plane, or below it  rather; for the instinct of the brute creation teaches it merely to eat  to live.    Yet how wide-spread is this habit of sensuous gratification through the  sense of taste! If one calls upon a neighbor, he is at once offered  refreshments of some kind, as though the greatest blessing of life came  from indulging the appetite. This evil is largely due to wrong  education, which begins with childhood. When Johnnie sits down to the  table, the mother says, \"Johnnie, what would you like?\" instead of  putting plain, wholesome food before the child, and taking it as a  matter of course that he will eat it and be satisfied. The child grows  to think that he must have what he likes, whether it is good for him or  not. It is not strange that an appetite thus pampered in childhood  becomes uncontrollable at maturity; for the step from gormandizing to  intoxication is much shorter than most people imagine. The natural,  unperverted taste of a child will lead him to eat that which is good for  him. But how can we expect the children to reform when the parents  continually set them bad examples in the matter of eating and drinking?    The cultivation of a taste for spices is a degradation of the sense of  taste. Nature never designed that pleasure should be divorced from use.  The effects of gratifying the sense of taste differ materially from  those of gratifying the higher senses of sight and hearing. What we see  is gone; nothing remains but the memory, and the same is true of the  sweetest sounds which may reach us through the ears. But what we taste  is taken into the stomach and what has thus given us brief pleasure  through the gratification of the palate, must make work in the  alimentary canal for fourteen hours before it is disposed of.    VARIETY IN FOOD.--Simplicity of diet should be a point of first  consideration with all persons upon whom falls the responsibility of  providing the family bills of fare, since the simplest foods are, as a  rule, the most healthful. Variety is needed; that is, a judicious  mingling of fruits, grains, and vegetables; but the general tendency is  to supply our tables with too many kinds and to prepare each dish in the  most elaborate manner, until, in many households, the cooking of food  has come to be almost the chief end of life. While the preparation of  food should be looked upon as of so much importance as to demand the  most careful consideration and thought as to its suitability,  wholesomeness, nutritive qualities, and digestibility, it should by no  means be made to usurp the larger share of one's time, when simpler  foods and less labor would afford the partakers equal nourishment and  strength.    A great variety of foods at one meal exerts a potent influence in  creating a love of eating, and is likewise a constant temptation to  overeat. Let us have well-cooked, nutritious, and palatable food, and  plenty of it; variety from day to day, but not too great a variety at  each meal.    The prevalent custom of loading the table with a great number of viands,  upon occasions when guests are to be entertained in our homes, is one to  be deplored, since it is neither conducive to good health nor necessary  to good cheer, but on the contrary is still laborious and expensive a  practice that many are debarred from social intercourse because they  cannot afford to entertain after the fashion of their neighbors.
