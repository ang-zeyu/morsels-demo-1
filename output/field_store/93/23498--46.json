The Canadian waters  are vocal with these little French chansons, that have been echoed from  mouth to mouth and transmitted from father to son, from the earliest  days of the colony; and it has a pleasing effect, in a still golden  summer evening, to see a batteau gliding across the bosom of a lake and  dipping its oars to the cadence of these quaint old ditties, or sweeping  along in full chorus on a bright sunny morning, down the transparent  current of one of the Canada rivers.    But we are talking of things that are fast fading away! The march of  mechanical invention is driving everything poetical before it. The  steamboats, which are fast dispelling the wildness and romance of our  lakes and rivers, and aiding to subdue the world into commonplace, are  proving as fatal to the race of the Canadian voyageurs as they have been  to that of the boatmen of the Mississippi. Their glory is departed. They  are no longer the lords of our internal seas, and the great navigators  of the wilderness. Some of them may still occasionally be seen coasting  the lower lakes with their frail barks, and pitching their camps  and lighting their fires upon the shores; but their range is fast  contracting to those remote waters and shallow and obstructed rivers  unvisited by the steamboat. In the course of years they will gradually  disappear; their songs will die away like the echoes they once awakened,  and the Canadian voyageurs will become a forgotten race, or remembered,  like their associates, the Indians, among the poetical images of past  times, and as themes for local and romantic associations.    An instance of the buoyant temperament and the professional pride of  these people was furnished in the gay and braggart style in which they  arrived at New York to join the enterprise. They were determined to  regale and astonish the people of the \"States\" with the sight of a  Canadian boat and a Canadian crew. They accordingly fitted up a large  but light bark canoe, such as is used in the fur trade; transported  it in a wagon from the banks of the St. Lawrence to the shores of Lake  Champlain; traversed the lake in it, from end to end; hoisted it again  in a wagon and wheeled it off to Lansingburgh, and there launched it  upon the waters of the Hudson. Down this river they plied their course  merrily on a fine summer's day, making its banks resound for the first  time with their old French boat songs; passing by the villages with  whoop and halloo, so as to make the honest Dutch farmers mistake them  for a crew of savages. In this way they swept, in full song and with  regular flourish of the paddle, round New York, in a still summer  evening, to the wonder and admiration of its inhabitants, who had never  before witnessed on their waters, a nautical apparition of the kind.    Such was the variegated band of adventurers about to embark in the  Tonquin on this ardous and doubtful enterprise. While yet in port and  on dry land, in the bustle of preparation and the excitement of novelty,  all was sunshine and promise. The Canadians, especially, who, with their  constitutional vivacity, have a considerable dash of the gascon, were  buoyant and boastful, and great brag arts as to the future; while all  those who had been in the service of the Northwest Company, and engaged  in the Indian trade, plumed themselves upon their hardihood and their  capacity to endure privations. If Mr. Astor ventured to hint at the  difficulties they might have to encounter, they treated them with scorn.  They were \"northwesters;\" men seasoned to hardships, who cared for  neither wind nor weather. They could live hard, lie hard, sleep hard,  eat dogs!--in a word they were ready to do and suffer anything for the  good of the enterprise. With all this profession of zeal and devotion,  Mr. Astor was not overconfident of the stability and firm faith of these  mercurial beings. He had received information, also, that an armed brig  from Halifax, probably at the instigation of the Northwest Company, was  hovering on the coast, watching for the Tonquin, with the purpose of  impressing the Canadians on board of her, as British subjects, and thus  interrupting the voyage. It was a time of doubt and anxiety, when  the relations between the United States and Great Britain were daily  assuming a more precarious aspect and verging towards that war which  shortly ensued. As a precautionary measure, therefore, he required  that the voyageurs, as they were about to enter into the service of  an American association, and to reside within the limits of the United  States, should take the oaths of naturalization as American citizens.  To this they readily agreed, and shortly afterward assured him that they  had actually done so. It was not until after they had sailed that he  discovered that they had entirely deceived him in the matter.    The confidence of Mr. Astor was abused in another quarter. Two of the  partners, both of them Scotchmen, and recently in the service of the  Northwest Company, had misgivings as to an enterprise which might clash  with the interests and establishments protected by the British flag.  They privately waited upon the British minister, Mr. Jackson, then  in New York, laid open to him the whole scheme of Mr. Astor, though  intrusted to them in confidence, and dependent, in a great measure, upon  secrecy at the outset for its success, and inquired whether they, as  British subjects, could lawfully engage in it. The reply satisfied their  scruples, while the information they imparted excited the surprise  and admiration of Mr. Jackson, that a private individual should have  conceived and set on foot at his own risk and expense so great an  enterprise.    This step on the part of those gentlemen was not known to Mr. Astor  until some time afterwards, or it might have modified the trust and  confidence reposed in them.    To guard against any interruption to the voyage by the armed brig, said  to be off the harbor, Mr. Astor applied to Commodore Rodgers, at that  time commanding at New York, to give the Tonquin safe convoy off  the coast. The commodore having received from a high official source  assurance of the deep interest which the government took in the  enterprise, sent directions to Captain Hull, at that time cruising  off the harbor, in the frigate Constitution, to afford the Tonquin the  required protection when she should put to sea.    Before the day of embarkation, Mr. Astor addressed a letter of  instruction to the four partners who were to sail in the ship. In this  he enjoined them, in the most earnest manner, to cultivate harmony and  unanimity, and recommended that all differences of opinions on points  connected with the objects and interests of the voyage should be  discussed by the whole, and decided by a majority of votes. He,  moreover, gave them especial caution as to their conduct on arriving at  their destined port; exhorting them to be careful to make a favorable  impression upon the wild people among whom their lot and the fortunes  of the enterprise would be cast. \"If you find them kind,\" said he, \"as  I hope you will, be so to them. If otherwise, act with caution and  forebearance, and convince them that you come as friends.\"    With the same anxious forethought he wrote a letter of instructions to  Captain Thorn, in which he urged the strictest attention to the health  of himself and his crew, and to the promotion of good-humor and harmony  on board his ship. \"To prevent any misunderstanding,\" added he, \"will  require your particular good management.\" His letter closed with an  injunction of wariness in his intercourse with the natives, a subject on  which Mr. Astor was justly sensible he could not be too earnest. \"I must  recommend you,\" said he, \"to be particularly careful on the coast, and  not to rely too much on the friendly disposition of the natives.  All accidents which have as yet happened there arose from too much  confidence in the Indians.\"    The reader will bear these instructions in mind, as events will  prove their wisdom and importance, and the disasters which ensued in  consequence of the neglect of them.

ON the eighth of September, 1810, the Tonquin put to sea, where she was  soon joined by the frigate Constitution. The wind was fresh and fair  from the southwest, and the ship was soon out of sight of land and free  from the apprehended danger of interruption. The frigate, therefore,  gave her \"God speed,\" and left her to her course.    The harmony so earnestly enjoined by Mr. Astor on this heterogeneous  crew, and which had been so confidently promised in the buoyant moments  of preparation, was doomed to meet with a check at the very outset.    Captain Thorn was an honest, straighforward, but somewhat dry and  dictatorial commander, who, having been nurtured in the system and  discipline of a ship of war, and in a sacred opinion of the supremacy of  the quarter-deck, was disposed to be absolute lord and master on board  of his ship. He appears, moreover, to have had no great opinion, from  the first, of the persons embarked with him--He had stood by with surly  contempt while they vaunted so bravely to Mr. Astor of all they could  do and all they could undergo; how they could face all weathers, put up  with all kinds of fare, and even eat dogs with a relish, when no better  food was to be had. He had set them down as a set of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#8)"],[1,"nd,  and his daughter married to a Russian of high distinction. Sir Robert  longed to return to England. He did not complain of any illness, and  everything was arranged for their departure; his final visits were  paid, all but one to the Emperor, who had ever treated him as a  friend; the day before his intended journey he went to the palace, was  graciously received, and then drove home, but when the servant opened  the carriage-door at his own residence he was dead! One sorrow after  another pressed heavily upon her; yet she was still the same sweet,  gentle, holy-minded woman she had ever been, bending with Christian  faith to the will of the Almighty,--\"biding her time\".    How differently would she have \"watched and waited\" had she been  tainted by vanity, or fixed her soul on the mere triumphs of \"literary  reputation\". While firm to her own creed, she fully enjoyed the  success of those who scramble up--where she bore the standard to the  heights of Parnassus; she was never more happy than when introducing  some literary \"Tyro\" to those who could aid or advise a future career.  We can speak from experience of the warm interest she took in the  Hospital for the cure of Consumption, and the Governesses' Benevolent  Institution; during the progress of the latter, her health was  painfully feeble, yet she used her personal influence for its success,  and worked with her own hands for its bazaars. She was ever aiding  those who could not aid themselves; and all her thoughts, words, and  deeds, were evidence of her clear, powerful mind and kindly loving  heart; her appearance in the London _coteries_ was always hailed with  interest and pleasure; to the young she was especially affectionate;  but it was in the quiet mornings, or in the long twilight evenings  of summer, when visiting her cherished friends at Shirley Park, in  Kensington Square, or wherever she might be located for the time--it  was then that her former spirit revived, and she poured forth anecdote  and illustration, and the store of many years' observation, filtered  by experience and purified by that delightful faith to which she  held,--that \"all things work together for good to them that love the  Lord\". She held this in practice, even more than in theory; you saw  her chastened yet hopeful spirit beaming forth from her gentle eyes,  and her sweet smile can never be forgotten. The last time we saw her,  was about two years ago--in Bristol--at her brother's, Dr. Porter's,  house in Portland Square: then she could hardly stand without  assistance, yet she never complained of her own suffering or  feebleness, all her anxiety was about the brother--then dangerously  ill, and now the last of \"his race.\" Major Porter, it will be  remembered, left five children, and these have left only one  descendant--the daughter of Sir Robert Ker Porter and the Russian  Princess whom he married, a young Russian lady, whose present name we  do not even know.    We did not think at our last leave-taking that Miss Porter's fragile  frame could have so long withstood the Power that takes away all we  hold most dear; but her spirit was at length summoned, after a few  days' total insensibility, on the 24th of May.    We were haunted by the idea that the pretty cottage at Esher, where  we spent those happy hours, had been treated even as \"Mrs. Porter's  Arcadia\" at Thames Ditton--now altogether removed; and it was with a  melancholy pleasure we found it the other morning in nothing changed;  and it was almost impossible to believe that so many years had passed  since our last visit. While Mr. Fairholt was sketching the cottage, we  knocked at the door, and were kindly permitted by two gentle sisters,  who now inhabit it, to enter the little drawing-room and walk round  the garden: except that the drawing-room has been re-papered and  painted, and that there were no drawings and no flowers the room was  not in the least altered; yet to us it seemed like a sepulcher, and we  rejoiced to breathe the sweet air of the little garden, and listen to  a nightingale, whose melancholy cadence harmonized with our feelings.    \"Whenever you are at Esher,\" said the devoted daughter, the last  time we conversed with her, \"do visit my mother's tomb.\" We did so.  A cypress flourishes at the head of the grave; and the following  touching inscription is carved on the stone:--        Here sleeps in Jesus a Christian widow, JANE PORTER. Obiit      June 18th, 1831, aetat. 86; the beloved mother of W. Porter,      M.D., of Sir Robert Ker Porter, and of Jane and Anna Maria      Porter, who mourn in hope, humbly trusting to be born again      with her unto the blessed kingdom of their Lord and Savior.      Respect her grave, for she ministered to the poor.           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT DEATHS.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. KIRBY, THE ENTOMOLOGIST.    The Rev. William Kirby, Rector of Barham, Suffolk, who died on the 4th  ult. in the ninety-first year of his age, with his faculties little  impaired, ranked as the father of Entomology in England; and to the  successful results of his labors may he chiefly attributed the advance  which has been made in this over other kindred departments of natural  history. His reputation is based not so much on the discoveries made  by him in the science as on the manner of its teaching. No man ever  approached the study of the works of nature with a purer or more  earnest zeal. His interpretation of the distinguishing characters of  insects for the purposes of classification has excited the warmest  approval of entomologists at home and abroad; while his agreeable  narrative of their wonderful transformations and habits, teeming with  analyses and anecdote, has a charm for almost every kind of reader.    Mr. Kirby's first work of particular note was the \"Monographia Apum  Angliae\", in two volumes published half a century ago at Ipswich; to  which town he was much endeared, and in whose Museum, as President,  under the friendly auspices of its Secretary, Mr. George Ransome, he  took a lively interest. His admirable work on the Wild Bees of Great  Britain was composed from materials collected almost entirely by  himself,--and most of the plates were of his etching. Entomology was  at that time a comparatively new science in this country, and it is an  honorable proof of the correctness of the author's views that they are  still acknowledged to be genuine.    His further progress in entomology is abundantly marked by various  papers in the \"Transactions of the Linnaean Society\",--by the  entomological portion of the Bridgewater Treatise \"On the History,  Habits, and Instincts of Animals,\"--and by his descriptions, occupying  a quarto volume, of the insects of Sir John Richardson's \"Fauna  Boreali-Americana.\" The name of Kirby will, however, be chiefly  remembered for the \"Introduction on Entomology\" written by him in  conjunction with Mr. Spence. In this work a vast amount of material,  acquired after many years' unremitting observation of the insect  world, is mingled together by two different but congenial minds in  the pleasant form of familiar letters. The charm, based on substantial  knowledge of the subject, which these letters impart, has caused  them to be studied with an interest never before excited by any work  on natural history,--and they have served for the model of many an  interesting and instructive volume. Whether William Kirby or William  Spence had the more meritorious share in the composition of these  Letters, has never been ascertained; for each, in the plenitude of his  esteem and love for the other, renounced all claim, in favor of his  coadjutor, to whatever portion of the matter might be most valued.    In addition to the honor of being President of the Museum of his  county town--in which there is an admirable portrait of him--Mr. Kirby  was Honorary President of the Entomological Society of London, Fellow  of the Royal, Linnaean, Geological, and Zoological Societies of the  same city, and corresponding member of several foreign societies.           *       *       *       *       *    The death of REV. DR. GRAY, Professor of Oriental Languages in the  University of Glasgow, is reported in the Scotch papers.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the favorite painters of Paris is Ingres, renowned especially  for the beauty of his designs from the human figure, and the sweetness  of his coloring. Eight years ago he was commissioned by M. de Luynes,  who then wore the title of Duke--which, it must be said, he is  still called by, though the Republic frowns on such aristocratic  distinctions--to paint two historical pictures in fresco, for a  country-house near Paris. The subjects were left to the choice of  the artist, who was to have 100,000 francs (or L20,000) for the two  pictures, one quarter of which was paid him in advance. During these  eight years Mr. Ingres has begun various designs, and done his best  to satisfy himself in the planning and execution of the pictures; but  in vain did he blot out one design and labor long and earnestly upon  another--success still fled from his pencil. At last, after eight  years' fruitless exertion, he despaired, and going to M. de Luynes,  told him that he could not make the pictures. At the same time he  offered to return the L5,000; but M. de Luynes, one of the most  munificent gentlemen in France, refused to receive it. Madame Ingres,  however, arranged the difficulty. She remembered that during these  eight years her kitchen had been regularly supplied with vegetables  from M. de Luynes' garden, and these she insisted on paying for. \"Very  well,\" said M. de Luynes, \"if you will have it so, my gardener shall  bring you his bill.\" Accordingly, not long after, the gardener brought  a bill for twenty-five francs. \"My friend,\" said Madame Ingres to him,  \"yo"]]]
