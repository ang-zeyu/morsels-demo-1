Then, too, there may be chemical noci-associations with enemies  now extinct, which, like the ticklish points, may still be active  on adequate stimulation.  This brief reference to the possible  relation of the phenomena of the acute infections to the laws  of natural selection and of specific chemical noci-association has  been made as a suggestion.  Since the doctrine of evolution explains  all or nothing, I have included many phenomena to see how reasonable  or unreasonable such an explanation might be.      Recapitulation      The following are the principal points presented:  In operations  under inhalation anesthesia the nerve impulses from the trauma  reach every part of the brain--the cerebrum that is apparently  anesthetized as well as the medulla that is known to remain awake--  the proof being the PHYSIOLOGIC exhaustion of and the PATHOLOGIC  change in the nerve-cells. Under ether anesthesia the damage  to the nerve-cells is at least four times greater than under  nitrous oxid.  Inhalation anesthesia is, therefore, but a veneer--  a mask that \"covers the deep suffering of the patient.\"  The cause  of the exhaustion of the brain is the discharge of nervous energy  in a futile effort to energize the paralyzed muscles in an attempt  to escape from the injury just as if no anesthetic had been given.  The exhaustion is, therefore, of the same nature as that from overexertion,  but if the nerve-paths connecting the field of operation  and the brain be blocked, then there is no discharge of nervous  energy from the trauma, and consequently there is no exhaustion,  however severe or prolonged the operation may be.    Fear is a factor in many injuries and operations.  The phenomena  of fear probably are exhibited only by animals whose natural defense  is nerve-muscular. The skunk, the porcupine, the turtle, have little  or no fear.  Fear is born of the innumerable injuries which have  been inflicted in the course of evolution.  Fear, like trauma,  may cause physiologic exhaustion of and morphologic changes  in the brain-cells. The representation of injury, which is fear,  being elicited by phylogenetic association, may be prevented  by the exclusion of the noci-association or by the administration  of drugs like morphin and scopolamin, which so impair the associational  function of the brain-cells that immunity to fear is established.  Animals whose natural defense is in muscular exertion, among which is man,  may have their dischargeable nervous energy exhausted by fear alone,  or by trauma alone, but most effectively by the combination of both.  What is the mechanism of this discharge of energy?  It is the adequate  stimulation of the nociceptors and the physiologic response for the purpose  of self-preservation. According to Sherrington, the nervous system  responds in action as a whole and to but one stimulus at a time.  The integration of the individual as a whole occurs not alone in injury  and fear, but also, though not so markedly, as a result of other  phylogenetic associations, such as those of the chase and procreation.  When adequate stimuli are repeated with such rapidity that the new  stimulus is received before the effect of the previous one has  worn off, a higher maximum effect is produced than is possible  under a single stimulus, however powerful.    Sexual receptors are implanted in the body by natural selection,  and the adequate stimuli excite the nerve-muscular reactions  of conjugation in a manner analogous to the action of the adequate  stimuli of the nociceptors.  The specific response of either  the sexual receptors or the nociceptors is at the expense  of the total amount of nervous energy available at the moment.  Likewise in daily labor, which, in the language of evolution,  is the chase, nervous energy is expended.  Under the dominance  of fear or injury, however, the integration is most nearly  absolute and probably every expenditure of nervous energy which is  not required for efforts toward self-preservation is arrested;  hence fear and injury drain the cup of energy to the dregs.  This is the potential difference between fear and desire,  between injury and conjugation.    What is the practical application of this?  In operative surgery  there is introduced a new principle, which removes from surgery much  of the immediate risk from its trauma by establishing ANOCI-ASSOCIATION;  it places certain of the phenomena of fear on a physical basis;  it explains to us the physical basis for the impairment of the entire  individual under worry or misfortune; it makes evident the physical  results of the daily noci-associations experienced by the individual  as a social unit.  On the other hand, it explains the power  of therapeutic suggestion and of other influences which serve  for the time to change the noci-integration; it shows the physical  basis for the difference between hope and despair; it explains  some of the phenomena of Graves' disease, of sexual neurasthenia,  possibly of hay-fever and of the common cold.  The principle is probably  equally applicable to the acute infections, in each of which chemical  noci-association gives rise to many of the phenomena of the disease  and it explains their cure by natural immunity and by vaccines.  This hypothesis should teach us to view our patients as a whole;  and especially should it teach the surgeon gentleness.  It should  teach us that there is something more in surgery than mechanics,  and something more in medicine than physical diagnosis and drugs.      Conclusion      The brain-cells have existed for eons and, amid the vicissitudes  of change, they have persisted with perhaps less alteration than has  the crust of the earth.  Whether in man or in the lower animals,  they are related to and obey the same general biologic laws,  thus being bound to the entire past and performing their function  in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association.    For so long a time have we directed our attention to tumors,  infections, and injuries that we have not sufficiently considered  the vital force itself.  We have viewed each anatomic and pathologic  part as an entity and man as an isolated phenomenon in nature.  May we not find in the laws of adaptation under natural selection,  and of phylogenetic association, the master key that will disclose  to us the explanation of many pathologic phenomena as they have  already explained many normal phenomena?    And may medicine not correlate the pathologic phenomena of the sick  man with the forces of evolution, as the naturalists have correlated  the phenomena of the sound man, and thus may not disease, as well  as health, be given its evolutionary setting?        PHYLOGENETIC ASSOCIATION IN RELATION TO THE EMOTIONS[*]      [*] Address before the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia,  April 22, 1911.      The surgeon is familiar with the manifestations of every variety  of the human emotions in the various stations of life, from infancy  to senility, in health and in disease.  Not only does he come  into intimate contact with the emotions displayed by the victims  of disease and of accidents, but he also observes those manifested  by the relatives and friends of the families of his patients.  Moreover, he is unhappily forced to notice the emotional effect  upon himself when he is waging an unequal battle against death--  the strain and worry at a crisis, when a life is in the balance  and a single false move may be fatal, is an experience known only  to the operating surgeon.    For the data for this paper, therefore, in which I shall for the most  part limit my discussion to the strongest of all emotions--FEAR--I have  drawn largely from my personal experience as a surgeon, as well  as from an experimental research in which I have had the valuable  assistance of my associates, Dr. H. G. Sloan, Dr. J. B. Austin,  and Dr. M. L. Menten.    I believe it can be shown that it is possible to elicit the emotion  of fear only in those animals that utilize a motor mechanism  in defense against danger or in escape from it.  For example,  the defense of the skunk is a diabolic odor which repels its enemies;  the skunk has no adequate equipment for defense or escape by  muscular exertion, and the skunk therefore shows little or no fear.  Again, certain species of snakes are protected by venom;  they possess no other means of defense nor have they adequate  motor mechanisms for escape and they show no fear.  Because of  their strength other animals, such as the lion, the grizzly bear,  and the elephant, show but little fear (Fig. 6). Animals which have  an armored protection, such as the turtle, show little fear.  It is, therefore, obvious that fear is not universal and that the  emotion of fear is felt only by those animals whose self-preservation  is dependent upon an uncertain adequacy of their power of muscular  exertion either for defense or for flight (Fig. 7).    What are the principal phenomena of fear?  They are palpitation  of the heart, acceleration of the rate and alteration of the rhythm  of the respiration, cold sweat, rise in body temperature,  tremor, pallor, erection of the hair, suspension of the principal  functions of digestion, muscular relaxation, and staring of the eyes  (Fig. 12). The functions of the brain are wholly suspended except those  which relate to the self-protective response against the feared object.  Neither the brain nor any other organ of the body can respond  to any other lesser stimulus during the dominance of fear.    From these premises it would appear that under the influence  of fear, most, perhaps all, of the organs of the body are divided  sharply into two classes:  First, those that are stimulated,  and, second, those that are inhibited.  Those that are stimulated  are the entire muscular system, the vasomotor and locomotor systems,  the senses of perception, the respiration, the mechanism for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12342"],[0,"The Nuttall Encyclopædia (#8)"],[1,"MOUNT, a small mountain overlooking Alba Longa.
