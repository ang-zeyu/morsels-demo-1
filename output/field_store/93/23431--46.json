Impulsive by nature, Rachel had also the courage of each impulse while  it lasted; on the other hand, if quick to act, she was only too ready to  regret. Like many another whose self-reliance is largely on the surface,  an achievement of the will and not the gift of a temperament, she  usually paid for a display of spirit with the most dispiriting  reaction; and this was precisely the case in point. Rachel was ashamed  alike of her rudeness and her vanity; the latter she traced to its  source. It was inspired by vague memories of other women who had been  through the same ordeal as herself. One had been handed a bouquet in the  dock; another had been overwhelmed by proposals of marriage. Rachel  herself had received letters of which the first line was enough. But  there had been no letter from Mr. Steel. Ah! but he had attended her  trial; she remembered him now, his continual presence had impressed  itself very subtly upon her mind, without the definite memory of a  single glance; and after the trial he sent her his card, he dogged her  in the train! What was she to think? There was the voice in which he had  offered her his aid; there was the look in his eyes; there was the  delicate indirectness of that offer.    A year or two ago, with all her independence, Rachel would not have been  so ready to repel one whose advances, however unwarrantable in  themselves, were yet marked by so many evidences of sympathy and  consideration. She had not always been suspicious and repellent; and she  sighed to think how sadly she must have changed, even before the  nightmare of the last few weeks.    But a more poignant reminder of her married life was now in store for  Rachel Minchin. She had come to Chelsea because it was the only portion  of the town in which she had the semblance of a friend; but there did  live in Tite Street a young couple with whom the Minchins had at one  time been on friendly terms. That was in the day of plenty and  extravagance; and the acquaintance, formed at an hotel in the Trossachs,  had not ripened in town as the two wives could have wished. It was Mrs.  Carrington, however, who had found the Minchins their furnished house,  while her husband certainly interested himself in Rachel's defence.  Carrington was a barrister, who never himself touched criminal work, but  he had spoken to a friend who did, to wit the brilliant terror of female  witnesses, and caustic critic of the police, to whom Rachel owed so  little. But to Carrington himself she owed much--more indeed than she  cared to calculate--for he was not a man whom she liked. She wished to  thank him for his kindness, to give certain undertakings and to ask his  advice, but it was Mrs. Carrington whom she really hoped to see. There  was a good heart, or Rachel was much mistaken. They would have seen more  of each other if Mrs. Carrington had had her way. Rachel remembered her  on the occasion of the solitary visit she had received at Holloway--for  Mrs. Carrington had been the visitor.    \"Don't tell Jim,\" she had said, \"when you get off and come to see us.\"    And she had kissed her captive sister in a way that made poor Rachel  sometimes think she had a friend in England after all; but that was  before her committal; and thereafter from that quarter not a word. It  was not Mrs. Carrington whom Rachel blamed, however, and those last  words of hers implied an invitation which had never been withdrawn. But  invitation or no invitation, friend or no friend, Mrs. Carrington she  would have to see. And even he would be different now that he knew she  was innocent; and if it was easy to see what he had believed of her  before, well, so much the more credit to him for what he had done.    So Rachel had decided before quitting the precincts of the Old Bailey;  but her subsequent experiences in street and train so absorbed her that  she was full of the interview that was over when she ought to have been  preparing for the one still before her. And, in her absence of mind, the  force of habit had taken advantage of her; instead of going on to Tite  Street, she turned too soon, and turned again, and was now appalled to  find herself in the very street in which her husband had met his death.    The little street was as quiet as ever; Rachel stood quite still, and  for the moment she was the only person in it. She stole up to the house.  The blinds were down, and it was in darkness, otherwise all was as she  remembered it only too well. Her breath came quickly. It was a strange  trick her feet had played her, bringing her here against her will! Yet  she had thought of coming as a last resort. The furnished house should  be hers for some months yet; it had been taken for six months from July,  and this was only the end of November. At the worst--if no one would  take her in--    She shuddered at the unfinished thought; and yet there was something in  it that appealed to Rachel. To go back there, if only for the shortest  time--to show her face openly where it was known--not to slink and hide  as though she were really guilty! That might give her back her  self-respect; that might make others respect her too. But could she do  it, even if she would? Could she bring herself to set foot inside that  house again?    Rachel felt tremulously in her pocket; there had been more keys than  one, and that which had been in her possession when she was arrested  was in it still. Nobody had asked her for it; she had kept it for this;  dare she use it after all? The street was still empty; it is the  quietest little street in Chelsea. There would never be a better chance.    Rachel crept up the steps. If she should be seen!    She was not; but a footstep rang somewhere in the night, and on that the  key was fitted and the door opened without another moment's hesitation.  Rachel entered, the door shut noisily behind her, and then her own step  rang in turn upon the floor. It was bare boards; and as Rachel felt her  way to the electric switches, beyond the dining-room door, her fingers  missed the pictures on the walls. This prepared her for what she found  when the white light sprang out above her head. The house had been  dismantled; not a stick in the rooms, not so much as a stair-rod on the  stairs, nor a blind to the window at their head.    The furniture removed while the use of it belonged legally to her! Had  they made so sure of her conviction as all that? Rachel's blood came  straight from zero to the boil; this was monstrous, this was illegal and  wicked. The house was hers for other two months; and there were things  of hers in it, she had left everything behind her. If they had been  removed, then this outrage was little short of felony, and she would  invoke the law from whose clutches she herself had escaped. Rachel had  expected to be terrified in the house; she was filled insted with anger  and indignation.    It was as she expected; not a trunk had been left; and the removal had  taken place that very week. This would account for the electric light  being still intact. Rachel discovered it by picking up a crumpled  newspaper, which seemed to have contained bread and cheese; it did  contain a report of the first day of the trial. They might have waited  till her trial was over; they should suffer for their impatience, it was  their turn. So angry was Rachel that her own room wounded her with no  memories of the past. It was an empty room, and nothing more; and only  on her return to the lower floor did that last dread night come back to  her in all its horror and all its pitifulness.    The double doors of the late professor! Rachel forgot her grudge against  his widow; she pulled the outer door, and pushed the inner one, just as  she had done in the small hours of that fatal morning, but this time all  was darkness within. She had to put on the electric light for herself.  The necessity she could not have explained, but it existed in her mind;  she must see the room again. And the first thing she saw was that the  window was broken still.    Rachel looked at it more closely than she had done on the morning when  she had given her incriminating opinion to the police, and the longer  she looked the less reason did she see to alter that opinion. The broken  glass might have been placed upon the sill in order to promote the very  theory which had been so gullibly adopted by the police, and the watch  and chain hidden in the chimney for the same purpose. They might have  hanged the man who kept them; and surely this was not the first thief  who had slunk away empty-handed after the committal of a crime  infinitely greater than the one contemplated.    Rachel had never wavered in these ideas, but neither had she dwelt on  them to any extent, and now they came one instant only to go the next.  Her husband was dead--that was once more the paramount thought--and she  his widow had been acquitted on a charge of murdering him. But for the  moment she was thinking only of him, and her eyes hung over the spot  where she had seen him sitting dead--once without dreaming it--and soon  they filled. Perhaps she was remembering all that had been good in him,  perhaps all that had been evil in herself; her lips quivered, and her  eyes filled. But it was hard to pity one who was at rest, hard for her  with the world to face afresh that night, without a single friend. The  Carringtons? Well, she would see; and now she had a very definite point  upon which to consult Mr. Carrington. That helped her, and she went,  quietly and unseen as she had come.    There was still a light in the ground-floor windows of the Tite Street  house, strong lights and voices; it was the dining-room, for the  Minchins had dined there once; and the voices did not include a feminine  one that Rachel could perceive. If there were people dining with them,  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12595"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 272, (#8)"],[1,"essentially connected with, far less dependent  upon, bodily weakness, as its cause. On the contrary, you will often  find such patients to be of full habit, and complaining of throbbing  headach, with flushing of the face, a full and strong pulse, though  sometimes the pulse is preternaturally slow; the tongue is often white  and dry, as in inflammation in general. These symptoms, considered in  themselves, would call for _antiphlogistic_ measures, such as  _bleeding_ and _purging_; and these are not at all the less  necessary because the patient is in a low and desponding state of mind.  In short, I know of no difference in the medical treatment of _mania_  and _melancholia_, merely as such; you must look to the state of  vascular action, both local and general, in order to lay down a proper  plan of cure.    _Hypochondriasis_ is a still slighter form of _mental derangement_,  and which is characterized by a preposterous anxiety and solicitude with  regard to the patient's own health, which in these cases is often little  if at all disturbed, with the exception of occasional uneasiness at the  stomach, arising from flatulency and other effects of indigestion. This  disorder in the state of the digestive function, is generally considered  by the patient as the real and primary disease, though 99 times in 100  it is merely secondary, the result of torpor of the alimentary canal  altogether. This torpor is the consequence of an oppressed condition of  brain, proceeding, for the most part, from increased arterial action in  this organ. Thus the effect is taken for the cause, and a treatment  directed in conformity with this mistaken notion. Happily, the practice  usually pursued on those occasions, and which is directed to the state  of the stomach and intestinal canal, is, as far as it goes, beneficial  to the primary disease; for occasional _purging_, whether with the  _blue pill_ or _Plummer's pill_, and the use of a simple and  abstemious mode of living, are as well calculated to relieve affections  of the brain, as those of the stomach. But the fault of such a mistaken  view of the subject is, that the treatment is confined too exclusively  to one organ, and that the one not primarily affected; to the neglect of  other means that may be as much or more required for the relief of the  head. Where, for example, the patient complains of throbbing headach,  with other marks of increased arterial action in and about the brain,  it is dangerous to rely solely upon _cathartics_, and to neglect  _bleeding_, a neglect, which, I have more than once seen reason to  believe, has been the occasion of fatal apoplexy ensuing.    The precise difference in the condition of the brain, in the three forms  of _insanity_ now mentioned, is not at all known. Dissection hitherto  has not thrown any light upon the subject; nor is it probable that it  will do so hereafter. The derangement of intellect in all of them, and  the mutual convertibility of one into the other, prove that there is no  essential or fundamental difference between them; and the same is true  with regard to their medical treatment. The moral management of the  patient calls for nicer discrimination, and requires much penetration  and judgment on the part of the practitioner, as well as extensive  experience in mental disorders altogether--_Clutterbuck's Lectures on  the Nervous System_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.    \"I am but a Gatherer and disposer of other men's stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *    A celebrated comedian dining at a tavern in the neighbourhood of  Covent-garden, after asking the waiter several times for a glass of  water without obtaining it, rang the bell violently, and swore \"He would  knock his eye out, if he did not immediately bring some.\" A gentleman  present remonstrated, and said, \"He would be less likely of getting it,  if he did so.\" \"Oh dear, no, sir; for if you take eye (i) from waiter,  you will get water directly.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Closterman painted the duke and duchess of Marlborough, and all their  children, in one picture.
