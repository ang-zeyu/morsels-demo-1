Volume 19, No. 541, April (#8)"],[1,"of Music._--A Scotch bag-piper traversing the mountains of Ulster,  in Ireland, was one evening encountered by a starved _Irish_ wolf. In his  distress the poor man could think of nothing better than to open his  wallet, and try the effects of his hospitality; he did so, and the savage  swallowed all that was thrown to him, with so improving a voracity as if  his appetite was but just returning to him. The whole stock of provision  was, of course, soon spent, and now his only recourse was to the virtues  of his bagpipe; which the monster no sooner heard, than he took to the  mountains with the same precipitation he had left them. The poor piper  could not so perfectly enjoy his deliverance, but that, with an angry look,  at parting, he shook his head, saying, \"Ay, are these your tricks? Had I  known your humour, you should have had your music before  supper.\"--_Bowyer's Anecdotes._           *       *       *       *       *    _Epitaph on Mr. Nightingale, Architect._      As the birds were the first of the architect kind,      And are still better builders than men,    What wonders may spring from a _Nightingale's_ mind,      When St. Paul's was produced by a _Wren._           *       *       *       *       *    _Poets._      The effects of disappointed love ......_Akenside._    Part of a lady's dress ................_Spencer._    What the ladies do, and a weight ......_Chatterton._    A manufactory, and a weight ..........._Milton._    The prayers of a glutton .............._Moore._    An indication of old age .............._Gray._    What a mortgage will do ..............._Cumberland._    The contributions of a miser .........._Little._    A troublesome companion ..............._Bunyan._    The soldier's home, and an alarm ......_Campbell._           *       *       *       *       *    _The Pyramids._--The Egyptians, according to Herodotus, hated the memory  of the kings who built the pyramids. The great pyramid occupied a hundred  thousand men for twenty years in its erection, without counting the  workmen who were employed in hewing the stones and conveying them to the  spot where the pyramid was built. Herodotus speaks of this work as a  torment to the people, and doubtless, the labour engaged in raising huge  masses of stone, that was extensive enough to employ a hundred thousand  men for twenty years, equal to two millions of men for one year, must have  been fearfully tormenting. It has been calculated that the steam engines  of England worked by thirty-six thousand men, would raise the same  quantity of stones from the quarry, and elevate them to the same height as  the great pyramid, in the short space of eighteen hours. It was recorded  on the pyramid, that the onions, radishes, and garlic, which the labourers  consumed, cost sixteen hundred talents of silver, which is equivalent to  several million pounds.

But free from anger, doubts, and jealous fear,    Die as they liv'd, united and sincere.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The love between friends is certainly most harmonious when wound up to the  highest pitch; but at that very time, is in greatest danger of breaking:  and upon the whole, the strongest friendships may be compared to the  strongest towns, which are too well fortified to be taken by open attacks;  but are always liable to be undermined by treachery or surprise.

At length he became something better, and began to talk  to the nurses, but in such terms that no one could understand him, till it  was discovered that he had forgotten his English, and was talking Welsh; a  language he had not spoken for eighteen years. Mr. Combe conceives that  the blow having hit the store-house in his head, where the Welsh language  was garnered, his youthful acquisitions were poured out, whilst the  English language, which he had learned much later, was overpowered and  obliterated by the force of his mother tongue.
