[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#7)"],[1,"of greeting to the King. I was quite glad that he had been spared  the unpleasant sight. He was a man of quick temper, and perhaps he would  not have taken it so placidly as I did.    At last we were at the Cathedral. Its great grey front, embellished  with hundreds of statues and boasting a pair of the finest oak doors in  Europe, rose for the first time before me, and the sudden sense of my  audacity almost overcame me. Everything was in a mist as I dismounted. I  saw the Marshal and Sapt dimly, and dimly the throng of gorgeously robed  priests who awaited me. And my eyes were still dim as I walked up the  great nave, with the pealing of the organ in my ears. I saw nothing of  the brilliant throng that filled it, I hardly distinguished the stately  figure of the Cardinal as he rose from the archiepiscopal throne to  greet me. Two faces only stood out side by side clearly before my  eyes--the face of a girl, pale and lovely, surmounted by a crown of the  glorious Elphberg hair (for in a woman it is glorious), and the face  of a man, whose full-blooded red cheeks, black hair, and dark deep eyes  told me that at last I was in presence of my brother, Black Michael. And  when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment, and his helmet  fell with a clatter on the floor. Till that moment I believe that he had  not realized that the King was in very truth come to Strelsau.    Of what followed next I remember nothing. I knelt before the altar and  the Cardinal anointed my head. Then I rose to my feet, and stretched out  my hand and took from him the crown of Ruritania and set it on my head,  and I swore the old oath of the King; and (if it were a sin, may it be  forgiven me) I received the Holy Sacrament there before them all. Then  the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim  me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an  excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room. The portrait of the King  is very good.    Then the lady with the pale face and the glorious hair, her train held  by two pages, stepped from her place and came to where I stood. And a  herald cried:    \"Her Royal Highness the Princess Flavia!\"    She curtsied low, and put her hand under mine and raised my hand and  kissed it. And for an instant I thought what I had best do. Then I  drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek, and she blushed red,  and--then his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop slipped in front of Black  Michael, and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the  Pope--the first and last which I have received from that exalted  quarter!    And then came the Duke of Strelsau. His step trembled, I swear, and  he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on  flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook  so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched. And  I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely  doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously  called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the  cheek. I think we were both glad when that was over!    But neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did I  see the least doubt or questioning. Yet, had I and the King stood side  by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little  consideration. But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that  I could be other than the King. So the likeness served, and for an hour  I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king  all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me  their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor  Square I had danced a score of times. Thank heaven, the old man was as  blind as a bat, and did not claim my acquaintance.    Then back we went through the streets to the Palace, and I heard them  cheering Black Michael; but he, Fritz told me, sat biting his nails like  a man in a reverie, and even his own friends said that he should have  made a braver show. I was in a carriage now, side by side with the  Princess Flavia, and a rough fellow cried out:    \"And when's the wedding?\" and as he spoke another struck him in the  face, crying \"Long live Duke Michael!\" and the princess coloured--it was  an admirable tint--and looked straight in front of her.    Now I felt in a difficulty, because I had forgotten to ask Sapt the  state of my affections, or how far matters had gone between the princess  and myself. Frankly, had I been the King, the further they had gone the  better should I have been pleased. For I am not a slow-blooded man, and  I had not kissed Princess Flavia's cheek for nothing. These thoughts  passed through my head, but, not being sure of my ground, I said  nothing; and in a moment or two the princess, recovering her equanimity,  turned to me.    \"Do you know, Rudolf,\" said she, \"you look somehow different today?\"    The fact was not surprising, but the remark was disquieting.    \"You look,\" she went on, \"more sober, more sedate; you're almost  careworn, and I declare you're thinner. Surely it's not possible that  you've begun to take anything seriously?\"    The princess seemed to hold of the King much the same opinion that Lady  Burlesdon held of me.    I braced myself up to the conversation.    \"Would that please you?\" I asked softly.    \"Oh, you know my views,\" said she, turning her eyes away.    \"Whatever pleases you I try to do,\" I said; and, as I saw her smile and  blush, I thought that I was playing the King's hand very well for him.  So I continued and what I said was perfectly true:    \"I assure you, my dear cousin, that nothing in my life has affected me  more than the reception I've been greeted with today.\"    She smiled brightly, but in an instant grew grave again, and whispered:    \"Did you notice Michael?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, adding, \"he wasn't enjoying himself.\"    \"Do be careful!\" she went on. \"You don't--indeed you don't--keep enough  watch on him. You know--\"    \"I know,\" said I, \"that he wants what I've got.\"    \"Yes. Hush!\"    Then--and I can't justify it, for I committed the King far beyond what I  had a right to do--I suppose she carried me off my feet--I went on:    \"And perhaps also something which I haven't got yet, but hope to win  some day.\"    This was my answer. Had I been the King, I should have thought it  encouraging:    \"Haven't you enough responsibilities on you for one day, cousin?\"    Bang, bang! Blare, blare! We were at the Palace. Guns were firing  and trumpets blowing. Rows of lackeys stood waiting, and, handing the  princess up the broad marble staircase, I took formal possession, as  a crowned King, of the House of my ancestors, and sat down at my own  table, with my cousin on my right hand, on her other side Black Michael,  and on my left his Eminence the Cardinal. Behind my chair stood Sapt;  and at the end of the table, I saw Fritz von Tarlenheim drain to the  bottom his glass of champagne rather sooner than he decently should.    I wondered what the King of Ruritania was doing.          CHAPTER 6    The Secret of a Cellar      We were in the King's dressing-room--Fritz von Tarlenheim, Sapt, and I.  I flung myself exhausted into an armchair. Sapt lit his pipe. He uttered  no congratulations on the marvellous success of our wild risk, but his  whole bearing was eloquent of satisfaction. The triumph, aided perhaps  by good wine, had made a new man of Fritz.    \"What a day for you to remember!\" he cried. \"Gad, I'd like to be King  for twelve hours myself! But, Rassendyll, you mustn't throw your heart  too much into the part. I don't wonder Black Michael looked blacker than  ever--you and the princess had so much to say to one another.\"    \"How beautiful she is!\" I exclaimed.    \"Never mind the woman,\" growled Sapt. \"Are you ready to start?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, with a sigh.    It was five o'clock, and at twelve I should be no more than Rudolf  Rassendyll. I remarked on it in a joking tone.    \"You'll be lucky,\" observed Sapt grimly, \"if you're not the late Rudolf  Rassendyll. By Heaven! I feel my head wobbling on my shoulders every  minute you're in the city. Do you know, friend, that Michael has had  news from Zenda? He went into a room alone to read it--and he came out  looking like a man dazed.\"    \"I'm ready,\" said I, this news making me none the more eager to linger.    Sapt sat down.    \"I must write us an order to leave the city. Michael's Governor, you  know, and we must be prepared for hindrances. You must sign the order.\"    \"My dear colonel, I've not been bred a forger!\"    Out of his pocket Sapt produced a piece of paper.    \"There's the King's signature,\" he said, \"and here,\" he went on, after  another search in his pocket, \"is some tracing paper. If you can't  manage a 'Rudolf' in ten minutes, why--I can.\"    \"Your education has been more comprehensive than mine,\" said I. \"You  write it.\"    And a very tolerable forgery did this versatile hero produce.    \"Now, Fritz,\" said he, \"the King goes to bed. He is upset. No one is to  see him till nine o'clock tomorrow. You understand--no one?\"    \"I understand,\" answered Fritz.    \"Michael may come, and claim immediate audience. You'll answer that only  princes of the blood are entitled to it.\"    \"That'll annoy Michael,\" laughed Fritz.    \"You quite understand?\" asked Sapt again. \"If the door of this room is  opened while we're away, you're not to be alive to tell us about it.\"    \"I need no schooling, colonel,\" said Fritz, a trifle haughtily.    \"Here, wrap yourself in this big cloak,\" Sapt continued to me, \"and  put on this flat cap. My orderly rides with me to the hunting-lodge  tonight.\"    \"There's an obstacle,\" I observed. \"The horse doesn't live that can  carry me forty miles.\"    \"Oh, yes, he does--two of him: one here--one at the lodge. Now, are you  ready?\"    \"I'm ready,\" said I.    Fritz"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#7)"],[1,"to the  engine-hood in a gasolene car, pointed,\" he explained. \"It will be just  like the front of the aluminum gas container of the airship, only built  of steel. In it will be a compartment for a set of batteries, and there  will be a searchlight there. From the top of some supporters in front  of the two rear seats, a slanting sheet of steel will come right down  to meet the sloping nose of the car. First I was going to have curtains  close over the top of the driver's seat, but I think a steel covering,  with a celluloid opening will be better and make less wind resistance.  I'll use leather side curtains when it rains. Under the front seats  will be a compartment for more batteries, and there will be a third  place under the rear seats, where I will also carry spare wheels and a  repair kit. The motors will be slung under the body of the car,  amidships, and there will also be room for some batteries there.\"    \"How are you going to drive the car?\" asked Mr. Sharp. \"By a shaft?\"    \"Chain drive,\" explained Tom. \"I can get more power that way, and it  will be more flexible under heavy loads. Of course it will be steered  in the usual way, and near the wheel will be the starting and reversing  levers, and the gear handle.\"    \"Gears!\" exclaimed the aged inventor. \"Are you going to gear an  electric auto? I never heard of that. Usually the motor directly  connected is all they use.\"    \"I'm going to have two gears on mine,\" decided Tom.    \"That's a new idea,\" commented the aeronaut.    \"It is,\" admitted the lad, \"and that's why my car is going to be so  speedy. I'll make her go a hundred miles an hour, if necessary!\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed his father.    \"I will!\" cried the young inventor, enthusiastically. \"You just wait  and see. I couldn't do it but for the gears, but by using them I'll  secure more speed, especially with the big reserve battery power I'll  have. I know I've got the right idea, and I'm going to get right to  work.\"    His father and Mr. Sharp were much interested, and closely examined his  sketches. In a few days Tom had made detailed drawings, and the aged  inventor looked at them critically. He had to admit that his son's  theory was right, though how it would work out in practice was yet to  be demonstrated. Mr. Swift offered some suggestions for minor changes,  as did Mr. Sharp, and the lad adopted some of them. Then, with Mr.  Jackson to help him, work was started on constructing the car.    Certain parts of it could be better purchased in the open market  instead of being manufactured in Mr. Swift's shop, and thus Tom was  able to get his new invention into some sort of shape sooner than would  otherwise have been the case. He also started making the batteries,  many of which would be needed.    Gradually the car began to take form on the floor of Tom's shop. It was  rather a curious looking affair, the sharp forward part making it  appear like some engine of war, or a projectile for some monster gun.  But Tom cared little for looks. Speed, strength and ease of control  were the chief features the lad aimed at, and he incorporated many new  ideas into his electric car.    He was busy in the shop, one morning, when, above the noise caused by  filing a piece of steel he heard some one exclaim:    \"Bless my gizzard! If you aren't as busy as ever!\"    \"Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom in delight. \"When did you get back?\"    \"Last night,\" replied the eccentric man. \"My wife and I stayed longer  than we meant to. And whom do you think we met when we were off on our  little trip?\"    \"Some of the Happy Harry gang?\"    \"Oh no. You'd never guess, so I'll tell you. It was Captain Weston.\"    \"Indeed! And how has he been since he went in the submarine with us,  and helped recover the gold from the wreck?\"    \"Very well. The first thing he said to me was: 'How is Tom Swift and  his father, if I may be permitted to ask?'\"    \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the lad, at the recollection of the odd sea captain,  who generally tagged on an apologetic expression to most of his remarks.    \"He was getting ready to take part in some South American revolution,\"  went on Mr. Damon. \"He used most of his money that he got from the  wreck to help finance their cause.\"    \"I must tell Mr. Sharp,\" went on the lad. \"He'll be interested.\"    \"Anything new since I've been away?\" asked the odd man. \"Bless my shoe  laces, but I'm glad to get back!\"    Tom told of the prospect of a new bank being started, and of Sam's  midnight visit, as well as the encounter with Mr. Foger and Andy.    \"I went over to see what Mr. Foger wanted of you,\" went on the young  inventor, \"but you weren't home. Did he call?\"    \"The servant said he had been there, not once, but several times,\"  remarked Mr. Damon. \"That reminds me. He left a note for me, and I  haven't read it yet. I'll do so now.\"    He tore open the letter, and hastily perused the contents.    \"Ha!\" he exclaimed. \"So that's what he wanted to see me about!\"    \"What?\" inquired Tom, with the privilege of an old friend.    \"Mr. Foger says he's going to start a new bank, and he wants me to  withdraw my deposit from the old one, and put it in his institution.  Says he'll pay me bigger interest. And he adds that some of the old  employees have gone with him.\"    \"I hope you're not going to change,\" spoke Tom, thinking of his chum,  Ned.    \"Indeed I'm not. The old bank is good enough for me. By the way,  doesn't a friend of yours work there?\"    \"Yes, Ned Newton. I'm wondering how he'll be affected?\"    \"Don't you worry!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my check book!  I'll  speak to Pendergast about your friend. Maybe there'll be a chance to  advance him further. I've got some mortgages falling due pretty soon,  and I'll deposit the money from them in the old bank. Then we'll see  what we can do about Ned.\"    \"They'll make you a bank director, if you keep on putting in money,\"  remarked our hero, with a smile.    \"Not much they won't!\" was the quick answer.    \"Bless my stocks and bonds! I've got trouble enough without becoming a  bank director. My doctor says my liver is out of order again, and I've  got to eat a lemon every morning before breakfast.\"    \"Eat a lemon?\"    \"Well, drink the juice! It's the same thing. But how is the electric  runabout coming on?\"    \"Pretty good.\"    \"Have you entered it in the races yet?\"    \"No, but I've written for information. I have until September to finish  it. The races take place then.\"    \"Let's see; they're on Long Island; aren't they? How do you calculate  to do; run from here to there?\"    \"No, Dad still has the cottage he rented when we built the submarine  and I think I'll make that my headquarters during the race. It's easy  to run from there over to the Long Island track.  They're building a  new one, especially for the occasion.    \"Well, I hope you win the prize. I must go to town now, as I have to  attend to some business. I don't s'pose you want to come in my auto.  I'm pretty sure something will break before I get there, and I'd like  to have you along to fix it.\"    \"Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't go,\" replied the lad. \"I must get this  car done, and then I've got to start on the batteries.\"    Mr. Damon rather reluctantly went off alone, looking anxiously at his  car, for the machine got out of order on every trip he took.    It was a few days after this that Tom received a call from Ned one  evening. The bank employee's face wore a happy smile.    \"What's the matter; some one left you a fortune?\" asked Tom.    \"Pretty nearly as good. I've got a better position.\"    \"What? Have you left the old bank, and gone to the new one?\"    \"No, I'm still in the same bank, but I'm one of the two cashiers now.  Mr. Foger took several of the old employees when he opened his new  bank, and that left vacancies. I was promoted, and so were one or two  others. Mr. Damon spoke a good word for me.\"    \"That's fine! He's a friend worth having.\"    \"That's right. Your father also recommended me. But how are things with  you? Has Andy made any more trouble?\"    \"No, and I don't believe he will. I guess he'll steer clear of me.\"    But Tom was soon to learn he was mistaken.          CHAPTER VII    TOM IS CAPTURED      Meanwhile the young inventor, aided by his father, Mr. Sharp and Garret  Jackson, the engineer, worked hard over his new car, and the powerful  batteries. A month passed, and such was the progress made that Tom felt  justified in making formal entry of his vehicle for the races to be  held by the Touring Club of America.    He paid a contingent fee and was listed as one of the competitors. As  is usual in an affair of this kind, the promoters of it desired  publicity, and they sought it through the papers.    Consequently each new entrant's name was published. In addition  something was said about his previous achievements in the speed line.    No sooner was the name of Tom Swift received by the officials of the  club, than it was at once recalled that young Swift had had a prominent  part in the airship Red Cloud, and the submarine Advance. This gave an  enterprising reporter a chance for a \"special\" for the Sunday  supplement of a New York newspaper.    Tom, it was stated, was building a car which would practically  annihilate distance and time, and there were many weird pictures,  showing him flying along without touching the ground, in a car, the  pictorial construction of which was at once fearful and wonderful.    Tom and his friends laughed at the yarn, at first, but it soon had  undesirable results. The young inventor had desired to keep secret the  fact that he was building a new electric vehicle, and a novel storage  battery, but the article in the paper aroused considerable interest.  Many persons came a long distance, hoping for a sight of the wonderful  car, as pictured in the Sunday supplement, but they had to be denied.  The news, thus leaking out, kept the Swift shops almost constantly  besieged by many curious ones, who sought,"]]]
