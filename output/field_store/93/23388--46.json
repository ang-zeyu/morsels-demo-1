Upon being  assured that if she had not been privately made way with, there was  every chance in their favor, she had grown a little calmer, but before  going away had so far forgotten herself as to intimate that if some  result was not reached before another fortnight had elapsed, she should  take the matter into her own hands and--She did not say what she would  do, but her looks were of a very menacing character. It was no wonder,  then, that her countenance bore marks of the keenest anxiety as she  trod the halls of that dim old mansion, with its dusky corners rich  with bronzes and the glimmering shine of ancient brocades, breathing  suggestions of loss and wrong; or bent her wrinkled forehead to gaze  from the windows for the coming of one whose footsteps were ever  delayed. She happened to be looking out, when after a longer stroll than  usual the master of the house returned. As he made his appearance at the  corner, I saw her hurriedly withdraw her head and hide herself behind  the curtain, from which position she watched him as with tired steps and  somewhat dejected mien, he passed up the steps and entered the house.  Not till the door closed upon him, did she venture to issue forth and  with a hurried movement shut the blinds and disappear. This anxiety on  her part redoubled mine, and thankful enough was I when on the next day  I found myself well enough to renew my operations. To ferret out this  mystery, if mystery it was,--I still found myself forced to admit the  possibility of there being none--had now become the one ambition of my  life; and all because it was not only an unusually blind one, but of a  nature that involved danger to my position as detective, I entered upon  it with a zest rare even to me who love my work and all it involves with  an undivided passion.    To equip myself, then, in a fresh disguise and to join Mr. Blake shortly  after he had left his own corner, was anything but a hardship to me that  bright winter morning, though I knew from past experience, a long and  wearisome walk was before me with nothing in all probability at the  end but reiterated disappointment. But for once the fates had willed  it otherwise. Whether Mr. Blake, discouraged at the failure of his own  attempts, whatever they were, felt less heart to prosecute them than  usual I cannot say, but we had scarcely entered upon the lower end of  the Bowery, before he suddenly turned with a look of disgust, and  gazing hurriedly about him, hailed a Madison Avenue car that was rapidly  approaching. I was at that moment on the other side of the way, but I  hurried forward too, and signaled the same car. But just as I was on the  point of entering it I perceived Mr. Blake step hastily back and with  his eyes upon a girl that was hurrying past him with a basket on her  arm, regain the sidewalk with a swiftness that argued his desire to stop  her. Of course I let the car pass me, though I did not dare approach him  too closely after my late conspicuous attempt to enter it with him. But  from my stand on the opposite curb-stone I saw him draw aside the girl,  who from her garments might have been the daughter or wife of any one  of the shiftless, drinking wretches lounging about on the four corners  within my view, and after talking earnestly with her for a few moments,  saunter at her side down Broome Street, still talking. Reckless at this  sight of the consequences which might follow his detection of the part  I was playing, I hasted after them, when I was suddenly disconcerted by  observing him hurriedly separate from the girl and turn towards me with  intention as it were to regain the corner he had left. Weighing in an  instant the probable good to be obtained by following either party,  I determined to leave Mr. Blake for one day to himself, and turn my  attention to the girl he had addressed, especially as she was tall and  thin and bore herself with something like grace.    Barely bestowing a glance upon him, then, as he passed, in a vain  attempt to read the sombre expression of his inscrutable face grown  five years older in the last five days, I shuffled after the girl now  flitting before me down Broome Street. As I did so, I noticed her dress  to its minutest details, somewhat surprised to find how ragged and  uncouth it was. That Mr. Blake should stop a girl wherever seen, clad  in a black alpaca frock, a striped shawl and a Bowery hat trimmed with  feathers, I could easily understand; but that this creature with her  faded calico dress, dingy cape thrown carelessly over her head, and  ragged basket, should arrest his attention, was a riddle to me. I  hastened forward with intent to catch a glimpse of her countenance if  possible; but she seemed to have acquired wings to her feet since her  interview with Mr. Blake. Darting into a crowd of hooting urchins that  were rushing from Centre Street after a broken wagon and runaway horse,  she sped from my sight with such rapidity, I soon saw that my only hope  of overtaking her lay in running. I accordingly quickened my steps when  those same hooting youngsters getting in the way of my feet, I tripped  up and--well, I own I retired from that field baffled. Not entirely so,  however. Just as I was going down, I caught sight of the girl tearing  away from a box of garbage on the curb-stone; and when order having  been restored, by which lofty statement I mean to say when your humble  servant had regained his equilibrium, I awoke to the fact that she had  effectually disappeared, I hurried to that box and succeeded in finding  hanging to it a bit of rag easily recognized as a piece of the old  calico frock of nameless color which I had been following a moment  before. Regarding it as the sole spoils of a very unsatisfactory day's  work, I put it carefully away in my pocket book, where it lay till--But  with all my zeal for compression, I must not anticipate.    When I came home that afternoon I found myself unexpectedly involved in  a matter that for the remainder of the day at least, prevented me from  further attending to the affair I had in hand. The next morning Mr.  Blake did not start out as usual, and at noon I received intimation  from Fanny that he was preparing to take a journey. Where, she could  not inform me, nor when, though she thought it probable he would take an  early train. Mrs. Daniels was feeling dreadfully, she informed me; and  the house was like a grave. Greatly excited at this unexpected move on  Mr. Blake's part, I went home and packed my valise with something of the  spirit of her who once said, under somewhat different circumstances I  allow, \"Whither thou goest I will go.\"    The truth was, I had travelled so far and learned so little, that  my professional pride was piqued. That expression of Mr. Gryce still  rankled, and nothing could soothe my injured spirit now but success.  Accordingly when Mr. Blake stepped up to the ticket office of the Hudson  River Railroad next morning, to buy a ticket for Putney, a small town  in the northern part of Vermont, he found beside him a spruce  young drummer, or what certainly appeared such, who by some strange  coincidence, wanted a ticket for the same place. The fact did not seem  in the least to surprise him, nor did he cast me a look beyond the  ordinary glance of one stranger at another. Indeed Mr. Blake had no  appearance of being a suspicious man, nor do I think at this time,  he had the remotest idea that he was either watched or followed; an  ignorance of the truth which I took care to preserve by taking my seat  in a different car from him and not showing myself again during the  whole ride from New York to Putney.        CHAPTER VII. THE HOUSE AT THE GRANBY CROSS ROADS      Why Mr. Blake should take a journey at all at this time, and why of  all places in the world he should choose such an insignificant town  as Putney for his destination, was of course the mystery upon which I  brooded during the entire distance. But when somewhere near five in the  afternoon I stepped from the cars on to the platform at Putney Station  only to hear Mr. Blake making inquiries in regard to a certain stage  running between that town and a still smaller village further east, I  own I was not only surprised but well-nigh nonplussed. Especially as  he seemed greatly disappointed to hear that it only ran once a day, and  then for an earlier train in the morning.    \"You will have to wait till to-morrow I fear,\" said the ticket agent,  \"unless the landlord of the hotel down yonder, can harness you up a  team. There is a funeral out west to-day and--\"    I did not wait to hear more but hurried down to the hotel he had pointed  out, and hunting up the landlord inquired if for love or money he could  get me any sort of a conveyance for Melville that afternoon. He assured  me it would be impossible, the livery stable as well as his own being  entirely empty.    \"Such a thing don't happen here once in five years,\" said he to me. \"But  the old codger who is dead, though a queer dick was a noted personage in  these parts, and not a man, woman or child, who could find a horse, mule  or donkey, but what availed himself of the privilege. Even the doctor's  spavined mare was pressed into service, though she halts on one leg and  stops to get her breath half a dozen times in going up one short hill.  You will have to wait for the stage, sir.\"    \"But I am in a hurry,\" said I as I saw Mr. Blake enter. \"I have business  in Melville tonight, and I would pay anything in reason to get there.\"    But the landlord only shook his head; and drawing back with the air of  an abused man, I took up my stand in the doorway where I could hear the  same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#8)"],[1,"heart, expanding, grew more gay;    Yet something loftier still than fair      Kept man's familiar looks away.    From fairy gardens, known to none,      She brought mysterious fruits and flowers--    The things of some serener sun--      Some Nature more benign than ours.      With each, her gifts the maiden shared--      To some the fruits, the flowers to some;    Alike the young, the aged fared;      Each bore a blessing back to home.    Though every guest was welcome there,      Yet some the maiden held more dear,    And cull'd her rarest sweets whene'er      She saw two hearts that loved draw near.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GLOVE (1797)    A TALE      Before his lion-court,    To see the gruesome sport,      Sate the king;    Beside him group'd his princely peers;    And dames aloft, in circling tiers,      Wreath'd round their blooming ring.      King Francis, where he sate,      Raised a finger--yawn'd the gate,      And, slow from his repose,      A LION goes!      Dumbly he gazed around      The foe-encircled ground;      And, with a lazy gape,      He stretch'd his lordly shape,      And shook his careless mane,      And--laid him down again!    [Illustration: THE KNIGHT SCORNS CUNIGONDE Eugen Klimsch]          A finger raised the king--      And nimbly have the guard      A second gate unbarr'd;        Forth, with a rushing spring,            A TIGER sprung!      Wildly the wild one yell'd      When the lion he beheld;      And, bristling at the look,      With his tail his sides he strook,            And roll'd his rabid tongue;    In many a wary ring    He swept round the forest king,      With a fell and rattling sound;--      And laid him on the ground,          Grommelling!    The king raised his finger; then    Leap'd two LEOPARDS from the den      With a bound;    And boldly bounded they    Where the crouching tiger lay      Terrible!    And he gripped the beasts in his deadly hold;    In the grim embrace they grappled and roll'd;      Rose the lion with a roar!      And stood the strife before;      And the wild-cats on the spot,      From the blood-thirst, wroth and hot,        Halted still!    Now from the balcony above,    A snowy hand let fall a glove:--    Midway between the beasts of prey,    Lion and tiger; there it lay,      The winsome lady's glove!    Fair Cunigonde said, with a lip of scorn,  To the knight DELORGES--\"If the love you have sworn  Were as gallant and leal as you boast it to be,  I might ask you to bring back that glove to me!\"    The knight left the place where the lady sate;  The knight he has pass'd thro' the fearful gate;  The lion and tiger he stoop'd above,  And his fingers have closed on the lady's glove!    All shuddering and stunn'd, they beheld him there--  The noble knights and the ladies fair;  But loud was the joy and the praise, the while  He bore back the glove with his tranquil smile!    With a tender look in her softening eyes,  That promised reward to his warmest sighs,  Fair Cunigonde rose her knight to grace;  He toss'd the glove in the lady's face!  \"Nay, spare me the guerdon, at least,\" quoth he;  And he left forever that fair ladye!           *       *       *       *       *        [Illustration: THE DIVER CARL GEHRTS]    THE DIVER (1797)    A BALLAD      [The original of the story on which Schiller has founded this ballad,  matchless perhaps for the power and grandeur of its descriptions, is  to be found in Kircher. According to the true principles of imitative  art, Schiller has preserved all that is striking in the legend, and  ennobled all that is common-place. The name of the Diver was Nicholas,  surnamed the Fish. The King appears, according to Hoffmeister's  probable conjectures, to have been either Frederic I. or Frederic II.,  of Sicily. Date from 1295 to 1377.]       \"Oh, where is the knight or the squire so bold,      As to dive to the howling charybdis below?--    I cast in the whirlpool a goblet of gold,      And o'er it already the dark waters flow;    Whoever to me may the goblet bring,    Shall have for his guerdon that gift of his king.\"      He spoke, and the cup from the terrible steep,      That, rugged and hoary, hung over the verge    Of the endless and measureless world of the deep,      Swirl'd into the maelstrom that madden'd the surge.     \"And where is the diver so stout to go--    I ask ye again--to the deep below?\"    And the knights and the squires that gather'd around,      Stood silent--and fix'd on the ocean their eyes;      They look'd on the dismal and savage Profound,      And the peril chill'd back every thought of the prize.    And thrice spoke the monarch--\"The cup to win,    Is there never a wight who will venture in?\"      And all as before heard in silence the king--      Till a youth with an aspect unfearing but gentle,    'Mid the tremulous squires--stept out from the ring,      Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle;    And the murmuring crowd as they parted asunder,    On the stately boy cast their looks of wonder.      As he strode to the marge of the summit, and gave      One glance on the gulf of that merciless main;    Lo! the wave that forever devours the wave      Casts roaringly up the charybdis again;    And, as with the swell of the far thunder-boom,    Rushes foamingly forth from the heart of the gloom.      And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars,[6]      As when fire is with water commix'd and contending,    And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars,      And flood upon flood hurries on, never-ending.    And it never _will_ rest, nor from travail be free,    Like a sea that is laboring the birth of a sea.      Yet, at length, comes a lull O'er the mighty commotion,    As the whirlpool sucks into black smoothness the swell    Of the white-foaming breakers--and cleaves thro' the ocean    A path that seems winding in darkness to hell.    Round and round whirl'd the waves-deeper and deeper    still driven,    Like a gorge thro' the mountainous main thunder-riven!      The youth gave his trust to his Maker! Before      That path through the riven abyss closed again--    Hark! a shriek from the crowd rang aloft from the shore,      And, behold! he is whirl'd in the grasp of the main!    And o'er him the breakers mysteriously roll'd,    And the giant-mouth closed on the swimmer so bold.      O'er the surface grim silence lay dark; but the crowd      Heard the wail from the deep murmur hollow and fell;    They hearken and shudder, lamenting aloud--      \"Gallant youth-noble heart-fare-thee-well, fare-thee-well!\"    More hollow and more wails the deep on the ear--    More dread and more dread grows suspense in its fear.      If thou should'st in those waters thy diadem fling,      And cry, \"Who may find it shall win it and wear;\"    God wot, though the prize were the crown of a king--      A crown at such hazard were valued too dear.    For never shall lips of the living reveal    What the deeps that howl yonder in terror conceal.      Oh, many a bark, to that breast grappled fast,      Has gone down to the fearful and fathomless grave;    Again, crash'd together the keel and the mast,      To be seen, toss'd aloft in the glee of the wave.    Like the growth of a storm, ever louder and clearer,    Grows the roar of the gulf rising nearer and nearer.      And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars,      As when fire is with water commix'd and contending;    And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars,      And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending;    And as with the swell of the far thunder-boom    Rushes roaringly forth from the heart of the gloom.      And, lo! from the heart of that far-floating gloom,[7]      What gleams on the darkness so swanlike and white?    Lo! an arm and a neck, glancing up from the tomb!--      They battle--the Man's with the Element's might.    It is he--it is he! In his left hand, behold!    As a sign!--as a joy!--shines the goblet of gold!      And he breathed deep, and he breathed long,      And he greeted the heavenly delight of the day.    They gaze on each other--they shout, as they throng--      \"He lives--lo the ocean has render'd its prey!    And safe from the whirlpool and free from the grave,    Comes back to the daylight the soul of the brave!\"      And he comes, with the crowd in their clamor and glee,      And the goblet his daring has won from the water,    He lifts to the king as he sinks on his knee;--      And the king from her maidens has beckon'd his daughter--    She pours to the boy the bright wine which they bring,    And thus spake the Diver--\"Long life to the king!      \"Happy they whom the rose-hues of daylight rejoice,      The air and the sky that to mortals are given!    May the horror below never more find a voice--      Nor Man stretch too far the wide mercy of Heaven!    Never more--never more may he lift from the sight    The veil which is woven with Terror and Night!      \"Quick-brightening like lightning--it tore me along,      Down, down, till the gush of a torrent, at play    In the rocks of its wilderness, caught me--and strong      As the wings of an eagle, it whirl'd me away.    Vain, vain was my struggle--the circle had won me,    Round and round in its dance, the wild element spun me.      \"And I call'd on my God, and my God heard my prayer      In the strength of my need, in the gasp of my breath--    And show'd me a crag that rose up from the lair,      And I clung to it, nimbly--and baffled the death!    And, safe in the perils around me, behold    On the spikes of the coral the goblet of gold!      \"Below, at the foot of the precipice drear,      Spread the gloomy, and purple, and pathless Obscure!    A silence of Horror that slept on the ear,      That the eye more appall'd might the Horror endure!
