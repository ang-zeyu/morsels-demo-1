[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#8)"],[1,"z,  on the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the patron saint  of the country.  Early in the morning several hundred soldiers were  drawn up before the church, with an excellent band, which played a  number of lively airs.  Between ten and eleven, the military and  civil officers began gradually to arrive, the subordinate ones, as I  was told, coming first.  On their entrance into the church, a  brownish-red silk cloak, which concealed the whole of the uniform,  was presented to each.  Every time that another of a higher rank  appeared, all those already in the church rose from their seats, and  advancing towards the new comer as far as the church door,  accompanied him respectfully to his place.  The emperor and his wife  arrived the last of all.  The emperor is extremely young--not quite  one and twenty--but six feet tall, and very corpulent; his features  are those of the Hapsburg-Lothering family.  The empress, a  Neapolitan princess, is small and slim, and forms a strange contrast  when standing beside the athletic figure of her husband.    High mass, which was listened to with great reverence by every one,  began immediately after the entrance of the court, and after this  was concluded the imperial pair proceeded to their carriage,  presenting the crowd, who were waiting in the church, their hands to  kiss as they went along.  This mark of distinction was bestowed not  only on the officers and officials of superior rank, but on every  one who pressed forward to obtain it.    A second, and more brilliant festival occurred on the 19th of  October; it was the emperor's birth-day, and was celebrated by high  mass in the Imperial Chapel.  This chapel is situated near the  Imperial Palace, to which it is connected by means of a covered  gallery.  Besides the imperial family, all the general officers, as  well as the first officials of the state, were present at the mass,  but in full uniform, without the ugly silk cloaks.  Surrounding all  was a row of Lancers (the body-guard).  It is impossible for any but  an eye-witness to form an idea of the richness and profusion of the  gold embroidery, the splendid epaulets, and beautifully set orders,  etc., displayed on the occasion, and I hardly believe that anything  approaching it could be seen at any European court.    During high mass, the foreign ambassadors, and the ladies and  gentlemen admitted to court, assembled in the palace, where, on the  emperor's return, every one was admitted to kiss his hand.    The ambassadors, however, took no part in this proceeding, but  merely made a simple bow.    This edifying ceremony could easily be seen from the square, as the  windows are very near the ground, and were also open.  On such  occasions continual salutes are fired from the imperial ships, and  sometimes from others in the harbour.    On the 2nd of November I saw a festival of another description--  namely, a religious one.  During this and the following days, old  and young proceed from one church to another, to pray for the souls  of the departed.    They have a singular custom here of not burying all their dead in  the church-yard, many bodies being placed, at an additional expense,  in the church itself.  For this purpose, there are, in every church,  particular chambers, with catacombs formed in the walls.  The corpse  is strewed with lime, and laid in a catacomb of this description,  where, after a lapse of eight or ten months, the flesh is completely  eaten away.  The bones are then taken out, cleaned by boiling, and  collected in an urn, on which is engraved the name, birth-day, etc.,  of the deceased.  These urns are afterwards set up in the passages  of the church, or sometimes even taken home by the relations.    On All-souls' day, the walls of the chambers are hung with black  cloth, gold lace, and other ornaments, and the urns are richly  decorated with flowers and ribbons, and are lighted up by a great  number of tapers in silver candelabra and chandeliers, placed upon  high stands.  From an early hour in the morning until noon, the  women and young girls begin praying very fervently for the souls of  their deceased relations, and the young gentlemen, who are quite as  curious as those in Europe, go to see the young girls pray.    Females on this day are dressed in mourning, and often wear, to the  great disgust of the curious young gentlemen before mentioned, a  black veil over their head and face.  No one, by the way, is allowed  to wear a bonnet at any festival of the church.    But the most brilliant of the public festivals I saw here, was the  christening of the imperial princess, which took place on the 15th  of November, in the Imperial Chapel, which is connected with the  palace.    Towards 3 o'clock in the afternoon a number of troops were drawn up  in the court-yard of the palace, the guards were distributed in the  corridors and the church, while the bands played a series of  pleasing melodies, frequently repeating the National Anthem, which  the late emperor, Peter I., is said to have composed.  Equipage  after equipage began to roll up to the palace, and set down the most  brilliantly attired company of both sexes.    At 4 o'clock the procession began to leave the palace.  First, came  the court band, clothed in red velvet, and followed by three  heralds, in old Spanish costume, magnificently decorated hats and  feathers, and black velvet suits.  Next walked the officers of the  law, and the authorities of every rank, chamberlains, court  physicians, senators, deputies, generals, and ecclesiastics, privy  councillors and secretaries; and, lastly, after this long line of  different personages, came the lord steward of the young princess,  whom he bore upon a magnificent white velvet cushion, edged with  gold lace.  Immediately behind him followed the emperor, and the  little princess's nurse, surrounded by the principal nobles and  ladies of the court.  On passing through the triumphal arch of the  gallery, and coming before the pallium of the church, the emperor  took his little daughter {23a} into his own arms, and presented her  to the people; an act which pleased me exceedingly, and which I  considered extremely appropriate.    The empress, with her ladies, had likewise already arrived in the  church through the inner corridors, and the ceremony commenced  forthwith.  The instant the princess was baptized, the event was  announced to the whole town by salvos of artillery, volleys of  musketry, and the discharge of rockets. {23b}  At the conclusion of  the ceremony, which lasted above an hour, the procession returned in  the same order in which it had arrived, and the chapel was then  opened to the people.  I was curious enough to enter with the rest,  and, I must own, I was quite surprised at the magnificence and taste  with which the building was decorated.  The walls were covered with  silk and velvet hangings, ornamented with gold fringe, while rich  carpets were spread underfoot.  On large tables, in the middle of  the nave, were displayed the most valuable specimens of the church  plate, gold and silver vases, immense dishes, plates, and goblets,  artistically engraved, and ornamented with embossed or open work;  while magnificent vessels of crystal, containing the most beautiful  flowers, and massive candelabra, with innumerable lights, sparkled  in the midst.  On a separate table, near the high altar, were all  the costly vessels and furniture which had been employed at the  christening; and, in one of the side chapels, the princess's cradle,  covered with white satin, and ornamented with gold lace.  In the  evening, the town, or rather, the public buildings, were  illuminated.  The proprietors of private houses are not required to  light up; and they either avail themselves of their privilege, or at  most, hang out a few lanterns--a fact which will be readily  understood, when it is known that such illuminations last for six or  eight days.  The public buildings, on the contrary, are covered from  top to bottom with countless lamps, which look exactly like a sea of  fire.    The most original and really amusing fetes to celebrate the  christening of the princess, were those given on several evenings in  some of the barracks:  even the emperor himself made his appearance  there for a few moments on different occasions.  They were also the  only fetes I saw here which were not mixed up with religious  solemnities.  The sole actors in them were the soldiers themselves,  of whom the handsomest and most active had previously been selected,  and exercised in the various evolutions and dances.  The most  brilliant of these fetes took place in the barracks of the Rua  Barbone.  A semicircular and very tasty gallery was erected in the  spacious court-yard, and in the middle of the gallery were busts of  the imperial couple.  This gallery was set apart for the ladies  invited, who made their appearance as if dressed for the most  splendid ball:  at the entrance of the court-yard they were received  by the officers, and conducted to their places.  Before the gallery  stood the stage, and at each side of the latter were ranged rows of  seats for the less fashionable females; beyond these seats was  standing-room for the men.    At eight o'clock the band commenced playing, and shortly afterwards  the representation began.  The soldiers appeared, dressed in various  costumes, as Highlanders, Poles, Spaniards, etc.; nor was there any  scarcity of danseuses, who, of course, were likewise private  soldiers.  What pleased me most was, that both the dress and  behaviour of the military young ladies were highly becoming.  I had  expected at least some little exaggeration, or at best no very  elegant spectacle; and was therefore greatly astonished, not only  with the correctness of the dances and evolutions, but also with the  perfect propriety with which the whole affair was conducted.    The last fete that I saw took place on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#8)"],[1,"I caught the inference I did not take it up, having no desire to  discuss them with her just them indeed, if ever.    I merely stared at her and listened. Questions, I felt sure, would be of  little use. It was better she should say her thought in her own way.    \"He is one influence, the most recent,\" she went on slowly, and always  very calmly, \"but there are others--deeper layers, as it were--  underneath. If his were the only one, something would happen. But  nothing ever does happen. The others hinder and prevent--as though each  were struggling to predominate.\"    I had felt it already myself. The idea was rather horrible. I shivered.    \"That's what is so ugly about it--that nothing ever happens,\" she said.  \"There is this endless anticipation--always on the dry edge of a result  that never materializes. It is torture. Mabel is at her wits' end, you  see. And when she begged me--what I felt about my sketches--I mean--\"    She stammered badly as before.    I stopped her. I had judged too hastily. That queer symbolism in her  paintings, pagan and yet not innocent, was, I understood, the result of  mixture. I did not pretend to understand, but at least I could be  patient. I consequently held my peace. We did talk on a little longer,  but it was more general talk that avoided successfully our hostess, the  paintings, wild theories, and him--until at length the emotion Frances  had hitherto so successfully kept under burst vehemently forth again.    It had hidden between her calm sentences, as it had hidden between the  lines of her letter. It swept her now from head to foot, packed tight in  the thing she then said.    \"Then, Bill, if it is not an ordinary haunted house,\" she asked, \"what  is it?\"    The words were commonplace enough. The emotion was in the tone of her  voice that trembled; in the gesture she made, leaning forward and  clasping both hands upon her knees, and in the slight blanching of her  cheeks as her brave eyes asked the question and searched my own with  anxiety that bordered upon panic. In that moment she put herself under  my protection. I winced.    \"And why,\" she added, lowering her voice to a still and furtive whisper,  \"does nothing ever happen? If only,\"--this with great emphasis--  \"something would happen--break this awful tension--bring relief. It's  the waiting I cannot stand.\" And she shivered all over as she said it, a  touch of wildness in her eyes.    I would have given much to have made a true and satisfactory answer. My  mind searched frantically for a moment, but in vain. There lay no  sufficient answer in me. I felt what she felt, though with differences.  No conclusive explanation lay within reach. Nothing happened. Eager as I  was to shoot the entire business into the rubbish heap where ignorance  and superstition discharge their poisonous weeds, I could not honestly  accomplish this. To treat Frances as a child, and merely \"explain away\"  would be to strain her confidence in my protection, so affectionately  claimed. It would further be dishonest to myself--weak, besides--to deny  that I had also felt the strain and tension even as she did. While my  mind continued searching, I returned her stare in silence; and Frances  then, with more honesty and insight than my own, gave suddenly the  answer herself--an answer whose truth and adequacy, so far as they went,  I could not readily gainsay:    \"I think, Bill, because it is too big to happen here--to happen  anywhere, indeed, all at once--and too awful!\"    To have tossed the sentence aside as nonsense, argued it away, proved  that it was really meaningless, would have been easy--at any other time  or in any other place; and, had the past week brought me none of the  vivid impressions it had brought me, this is doubtless what I should  have done. My narrowness again was proved. We understand in others only  what we have in ourselves. But her explanation, in a measure, I knew was  true. It hinted at the strife and struggle that my notion of a Shadow  had seemed to cover thinly.    \"Perhaps,\" I murmured lamely, waiting in vain for her to say more. \"But  you said just now that you felt the thing was 'in layers', as it were.  Do you mean each one--each influence--fighting for the upper hand?\"    I used her phraseology to conceal my own poverty. Terminology, after  all, was nothing, provided we could reach the idea itself.    Her eyes said yes. She had her clear conception, arrived at  independently, as was her way.    And, unlike her sex, she kept it clear, unsmothered by too many words.    \"One set of influences gets at me, another gets at you. It's according  to our temperaments, I think.\" She glanced significantly at the vile  portfolio. \"Sometimes they are mixed--and therefore false. There has  always been in me, more than in you, the pagan thing, perhaps, though  never, thank God, like that.\"    The frank confession of course invited my own, as it was meant to do.  Yet it was difficult to find the words.    \"What I have felt in this place, Frances, I honestly can hardly tell  you, because--er--my impressions have not arranged themselves in any  definite form I can describe. The strife, the agony of vainly-sought  escape, and the unrest--a sort of prison atmosphere--this I have felt at  different times and with varying degrees of strength. But I find, as  yet, no final label to attach. I couldn't say pagan, Christian, or  anything like that, I mean, as you do. As with the blind and deaf, you  may have an intensification of certain senses denied to me, or even  another sense altogether in embryo--\"    \"Perhaps,\" she stopped me, anxious to keep to the point, \"you feel it as  Mabel does. She feels the whole thing complete.\"    \"That also is possible,\" I said very slowly. I was thinking behind my  words. Her odd remark that it was \"big and awful\" came back upon me as  true. A vast sensation of distress and discomfort swept me suddenly.  Pity was in it, and a fierce contempt, a savage, bitter anger as well.  Fury against some sham authority was part of it.    \"Frances,\" I said, caught unawares, and dropping all pretence, \"what in  the world can it be?\" I looked hard at her. For some minutes neither of  us spoke.    \"Have you felt no desire to interpret it?\" she asked presently, \"Mabel  did suggest my writing something about the house,\" was my reply, \"but  I've felt nothing imperative. That sort of writing is not my line, you  know. My only feeling,\" I added, noticing that she waited for more, \"is  the impulse to explain, discover, get it out of me somehow, and so get  rid of it. Not by writing, though--as yet.\" And again I repeated my  former question:    \"What in the world do you think it is?\" My voice had become  involuntarily hushed. There was awe in it. Her answer, given with slow  emphasis, brought back all my reserve: the phraseology provoked me  rather:--\"Whatever it is, Bill, it is not of God.\"    I got up to go downstairs. I believe I shrugged my shoulders. \"Would you  like to leave, Frances? Shall we go back to town?\" I suggested this at  the door, and hearing no immediate reply, I turned back to look. Frances  was sitting with her head bowed over and buried in her hands. The  attitude horribly suggested tears. No woman, I realized, can keep back  the pressure of strong emotion as long as Frances had done, without  ending in a fluid collapse. I waited a moment uneasily, longing to  comfort, yet afraid to act--and in this way discovered the existence of  the appalling emotion in myself, hitherto but half guessed. At all costs  a scene must be prevented: it would involve such exaggeration and  overstatement. Brutally, such is the weakness of the ordinary man, I  turned the handle to go out, but my sister then raised her head. The  sunlight caught her face, framed untidily in its auburn hair, and I saw  her wonderful expression with a start. Pity, tenderness, and sympathy  shone in it like a flame. It was undeniable. There shone through all her  features the imperishable love and yearning to sacrifice self for others  which I have seen in only one type of human being. It was the great  mother look.    \"We must stay by Mabel and help her get it straight,\" she whispered,  making the decision for us both.    I murmured agreement. Abashed and half ashamed, I stole softly from the  room and went out into the grounds. And the first thing clearly realized  when alone was this: that the long scene between us was without definite  result. The exchange of confidence was really nothing but hints and  vague suggestion. We had decided to stay, but it was a negative decision  not to leave rather than a positive action. All our words and questions,  our guesses, inferences, explanations, our most subtle allusions and  insinuations, even the odious paintings themselves, were without  definite result. Nothing had happened.          Chapter VI      And instinctively, once alone, I made for the places where she had  painted her extraordinary pictures; I tried to see what she had seen.  Perhaps, now that she had opened my mind to another view, I should be  sensitive to some similar interpretation--and possibly by way of  literary expression. If I were to write about the place, I asked myself,  how should I treat it? I deliberately invited an interpretation in the  way that came easiest to me--writing.    But in this case there came no such revelation. Looking closely at the  trees and flowers, the bits of lawn and terrace, the rose-garden and  corner of the house where the flaming creeper hung so thickly, I  discovered nothing of the odious, unpure thing her color and grouping  had unconsciously revealed. At first, that is, I discovered nothing. The  reality stood there, commonplace and ugly, side by side with her  distorted version of it that lay in my mind. It seemed incredible. I  tried to force it, but in vain. My imagination, ploughed less deeply  than hers, or to another pattern, grew different seed. Where I saw the  gross"]]]
