Instantly I seized it and taking a last  view of the world--as I then thought--I ate the berry in a twinkling.  Then, to my surprise, I began to grow big again, until I became of my  former stature, and so I have since remained. Needless to say, I have  never eaten again of the lavender fruit, nor do any of the beasts or  birds that live upon this island eat it.\"    They had all three listened eagerly to this amazing tale, and when it  was finished the Ork exclaimed:    \"Do you think, then, that the deep purple berry is the antidote for the  lavender one?\"    \"I'm sure of it,\" answered Pessim.    \"Then lead me to the tree at once!\" begged the Ork, \"for this tiny form  I now have terrifies me greatly.\"    Pessim examined the Ork closely    \"You are ugly enough as you are,\" said he. \"Were you any larger you  might be dangerous.\"    \"Oh, no,\" Trot assured him; \"the Ork has been our good friend. Please  take us to the tree.\"    Then Pessim consented, although rather reluctantly. He led them to the  right, which was the east side of the island, and in a few minutes  brought them near to the edge of the grove which faced the shore of the  ocean. Here stood a small tree bearing berries of a deep purple color.  The fruit looked very enticing and Cap'n Bill reached up and selected  one that seemed especially plump and ripe.    The Ork had remained perched upon Trot's shoulder but now it flew down  to the ground. It was so difficult for Cap'n Bill to kneel down, with  his wooden leg, that the little girl took the berry from him and held  it close to the Ork's head.    \"It's too big to go into my mouth,\" said the little creature, looking  at the fruit sidewise.    \"You'll have to make sev'ral mouthfuls of it, I guess,\" said Trot; and  that is what the Ork did. He pecked at the soft, ripe fruit with his  bill and ate it up very quickly, because it was good.    Even before he had finished the berry they could see the Ork begin to  grow. In a few minutes he had regained his natural size and was  strutting before them, quite delighted with his transformation.    \"Well, well! What do you think of me now?\" he asked proudly.    \"You are very skinny and remarkably ugly,\" declared Pessim.    \"You are a poor judge of Orks,\" was the reply. \"Anyone can see that I'm  much handsomer than those dreadful things called birds, which are all  fluff and feathers.\"    \"Their feathers make soft beds,\" asserted Pessim. \"And my skin would  make excellent drumheads,\" retorted the Ork. \"Nevertheless, a plucked  bird or a skinned Ork would be of no value to himself, so we needn't  brag of our usefulness after we are dead. But for the sake of argument,  friend Pessim, I'd like to know what good you would be, were you not  alive?\"    \"Never mind that,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"He isn't much good as he is.\"    \"I am King of this Island, allow me to say, and you're intruding on my  property,\" declared the little man, scowling upon them. \"If you don't  like me--and I'm sure you don't, for no one else does--why don't you go  away and leave me to myself?\"    \"Well, the Ork can fly, but we can't,\" explained Trot, in answer. \"We  don't want to stay here a bit, but I don't see how we can get away.\"    \"You can go back into the hole you came from.\"    Cap'n Bill shook his head; Trot shuddered at the thought; the Ork  laughed aloud.    \"You may be King here,\" the creature said to Pessim, \"but we intend to  run this island to suit ourselves, for we are three and you are one,  and the balance of power lies with us.\"    The little man made no reply to this, although as they walked back to  the shed his face wore its fiercest scowl. Cap'n Bill gathered a lot of  leaves and, assisted by Trot, prepared two nice beds in opposite  corners of the shed. Pessim slept in a hammock which he swung between  two trees.    They required no dishes, as all their food consisted of fruits and nuts  picked from the trees; they made no fire, for the weather was warm and  there was nothing to cook; the shed had no furniture other than the  rude stool which the little man was accustomed to sit upon. He called  it his \"throne\" and they let him keep it.    So they lived upon the island for three days, and rested and ate to  their hearts' content. Still, they were not at all happy in this life  because of Pessim. He continually found fault with them, and all that  they did, and all their surroundings. He could see nothing good or  admirable in all the world and Trot soon came to understand why the  little man's former neighbors had brought him to this island and left  him there, all alone, so he could not annoy anyone. It was their  misfortune that they had been led to this place by their adventures,  for often they would have preferred the company of a wild beast to that  of Pessim.    On the fourth day a happy thought came to the Ork. They had all been  racking their brains for a possible way to leave the island, and  discussing this or that method, without finding a plan that was  practical. Cap'n Bill had said he could make a raft of the trees, big  enough to float them all, but he had no tools except those two  pocketknives and it was not possible to chop down tree with such small  blades.    \"And s'pose we got afloat on the ocean,\" said Trot, \"where would we  drift to, and how long would it take us to get there?\"    Cap'n Bill was forced to admit he didn't know. The Ork could fly away  from the island any time it wished to, but the queer creature was loyal  to his new friends and refused to leave them in such a lonely, forsaken  place.    It was when Trot urged him to go, on this fourth morning, that the Ork  had his happy thought.    \"I will go,\" said he, \"if you two will agree to ride upon my back.\"    \"We are too heavy; you might drop us,\" objected Cap'n Bill.    \"Yes, you are rather heavy for a long journey,\" acknowledged the Ork,  \"but you might eat of those lavender berries and become so small that I  could carry you with ease.\"    This quaint suggestion startled Trot and she looked gravely at the  speaker while she considered it, but Cap'n Bill gave a scornful snort  and asked:    \"What would become of us afterward? We wouldn't be much good if we were  some two or three inches high. No, Mr. Ork, I'd rather stay here, as I  am, than be a hop-o'-my-thumb somewhere else.\"    \"Why couldn't you take some of the dark purple berries along with you,  to eat after we had reached our destination?\" inquired the Ork. \"Then  you could grow big again whenever you pleased.\"    Trot clapped her hands with delight.    \"That's it!\" she exclaimed. \"Let's do it, Cap'n Bill.\"    The old sailor did not like the idea at first, but he thought it over  carefully and the more he thought the better it seemed.    \"How could you manage to carry us, if we were so small?\" he asked.    \"I could put you in a paper bag, and tie the bag around my neck.\"    \"But we haven't a paper bag,\" objected Trot.    The Ork looked at her.    \"There's your sunbonnet,\" it said presently, \"which is hollow in the  middle and has two strings that you could tie around my neck.\"    Trot took off her sunbonnet and regarded it critically. Yes, it might  easily hold both her and Cap'n Bill, after they had eaten the lavender  berries and been reduced in size. She tied the strings around the Ork's  neck and the sunbonnet made a bag in which two tiny people might ride  without danger of falling out. So she said:    \"I b'lieve we'll do it that way, Cap'n.\"    Cap'n Bill groaned but could make no logical objection except that the  plan seemed to him quite dangerous--and dangerous in more ways than one.    \"I think so, myself,\" said Trot soberly. \"But nobody can stay alive  without getting into danger sometimes, and danger doesn't mean getting  hurt, Cap'n; it only means we might get hurt. So I guess we'll have to  take the risk.\"    \"Let's go and find the berries,\" said the Ork.    They said nothing to Pessim, who was sitting on his stool and scowling  dismally as he stared at the ocean, but started at once to seek the  trees that bore the magic fruits. The Ork remembered very well where  the lavender berries grew and led his companions quickly to the spot.    Cap'n Bill gathered two berries and placed them carefully in his  pocket. Then they went around to the east side of the island and found  the tree that bore the dark purple berries.    \"I guess I'll take four of these,\" said the sailor-man, \"so in case one  doesn't make us grow big we can eat another.\"    \"Better take six,\" advised the Ork. \"It's well to be on the safe side,  and I'm sure these trees grow nowhere else in all the world.\"    So Cap'n Bill gathered six of the purple berries and with their  precious fruit they returned to the shed to big good-bye to Pessim.  Perhaps they would not have granted the surly little man this courtesy  had they not wished to use him to tie the sunbonnet around the Ork's  neck.    When Pessim learned they were about to leave him he at first looked  greatly pleased, but he suddenly recollected that nothing ought to  please him and so began to grumble about being left alone.    \"We knew it wouldn't suit you,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"It didn't suit  you to have us here, and it won't suit you to have us go away.\"    \"That is quite true,\" admitted Pessim. \"I haven't been suited since I  can remember; so it doesn't matter to me in the least whether you go or  stay.\"    He was interested in their experiment, however, and willingly agreed to  assist, although he prophesied they would fall out of the sunbonnet on  their way and be either drowned in the ocean or crushed upon some rocky  shore. This uncheerful prospect did not daunt Trot, but it made Cap'n  Bill quite nervous.    \"I will eat my berry first,\" said Trot, as she placed her sunbonnet on  the ground, in such manner that they could get into it.    Then she ate the lavender berry and in a few seconds became so small"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#7)"],[1,"agon.  The Wizard and Button-Bright also slept  out of doors, and so did the Cowardly Lion and Hank the Mule.  But  Scraps and the Sawhorse did not sleep at all, and the Woozy could stay  awake for a month at a time if he wished to, so these three sat in a  little group by themselves and talked together all through the night.    In the darkness, the Cowardly Lion felt a shaggy little form nestling  beside his own, and he said sleepily, \"Where did you come from, Toto?\"    \"From home,\" said the dog. \"If you roll over, roll the other way so you  won't smash me.\"    \"Does Dorothy know you are here?\" asked the Lion.    \"I believe not,\" admitted Toto, and he added a little anxiously, \"Do  you think, friend Lion, we are now far enough from the Emerald City for  me to risk showing myself, or will Dorothy send me back because I  wasn't invited?\"    \"Only Dorothy can answer that question,\" said the Lion.  \"For my part,  Toto, I consider this affair none of my business, so you must act as  you think best.\"  Then the huge beast went to sleep again, and Toto  snuggled closer to the warm, hairy body and also slept.  He was a wise  little dog in his way, and didn't intend to worry when there was  something much better to do.    In the morning the Wizard built a fire, over which the girls cooked a  very good breakfast.  Suddenly Dorothy discovered Toto sitting quietly  before the fire, and the little girl exclaimed, \"Goodness me, Toto!  Where did YOU come from?\"    \"From the place you cruelly left me,\" replied the dog in a reproachful  tone.    \"I forgot all about you,\" admitted Dorothy, \"and if I hadn't, I'd  prob'ly left you with Jellia Jamb, seeing this isn't a pleasure trip  but stric'ly business.  But now that you're here, Toto, I s'pose you'll  have to stay with us, unless you'd rather go back again.  We may get  ourselves into trouble before we're done, Toto.\"    \"Never mind that,\" said Toto, wagging his tail.  \"I'm hungry, Dorothy.\"    \"Breakfas'll soon be ready, and then you shall have your share,\"  promised his little mistress, who was really glad to have her dog with  her.  She and Toto had traveled together before, and she knew he was a  good and faithful comrade.    When the food was cooked and served, the girls invited the old shepherd  to join them in the morning meal.  He willingly consented, and while  they ate he said to them, \"You are now about to pass through a very  dangerous country, unless you turn to the north or to the south to  escape its perils.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Cowardly Lion, \"let us turn, by all means, for  I dread to face dangers of any sort.\"    \"What's the matter with the country ahead of us?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"Beyond this Rolling Prairie,\" explained the shepherd, \"are the  Merry-Go-Round Mountains, set close together and surrounded by deep  gulfs so that no one is able to get past them.  Beyond the  Merry-Go-Round Mountains it is said the Thistle-Eaters and the Herkus  live.\"    \"What are they like?\" demanded Dorothy.    \"No one knows, for no one has ever passed the Merry-Go-Round  Mountains,\" was the reply, \"but it is said that the Thistle-Eaters  hitch dragons to their chariots and that the Herkus are waited upon by  giants whom they have conquered and made their slaves.\"    \"Who says all that?\" asked Betsy.    \"It is common report,\" declared the shepherd. \"Everyone believes it.\"    \"I don't see how they know,\" remarked little Trot, \"if no one has been  there.\"    \"Perhaps the birds who fly over that country brought the news,\"  suggested Betsy.    \"If you escaped those dangers,\" continued the shepherd, \"you might  encounter others still more serious before you came to the next branch  of the Winkie River.  It is true that beyond that river there lies a  fine country inhabited by good people, and if you reached there, you  would have no further trouble.  It is between here and the west branch  of the Winkie River that all dangers lie, for that is the unknown  territory that is inhabited by terrible, lawless people.\"    \"It may be, and it may not be,\" said the Wizard.  \"We shall know when  we get there.\"    \"Well,\" persisted the shepherd, \"in a fairy country such as ours, every  undiscovered place is likely to harbor wicked creatures.  If they were  not wicked, they would discover themselves and by coming among us  submit to Ozma's rule and be good and considerate, as are all the Oz  people whom we know.\"    \"That argument,\" stated the little Wizard, \"convinces me that it is our  duty to go straight to those unknown places, however dangerous they may  be, for it is surely some cruel and wicked person who has stolen our  Ozma, and we know it would be folly to search among good people for the  culprit.  Ozma may not be hidden in the secret places of the Winkie  Country, it is true, but it is our duty to travel to every spot,  however dangerous, where our beloved Ruler is likely to be imprisoned.\"    \"You're right about that,\" said Button-Bright approvingly.  \"Dangers  don't hurt us.  Only things that happen ever hurt anyone, and a danger  is a thing that might happen and might not happen, and sometimes don't  amount to shucks.  I vote we go ahead and take our chances.\"    They were all of the same opinion, so they packed up and said goodbye  to the friendly shepherd and proceeded on their way.          CHAPTER 7    THE MERRY-GO-ROUND MOUNTAINS      The Rolling Prairie was not difficult to travel over, although it was  all uphill and downhill, so for a while they made good progress.  Not  even a shepherd was to be met with now, and the farther they advanced  the more dreary the landscape became.  At noon they stopped for a  \"picnic luncheon,\" as Betsy called it, and then they again resumed  their journey.  All the animals were swift and tireless, and even the  Cowardly Lion and the Mule found they could keep up with the pace of  the Woozy and the Sawhorse.    It was the middle of the afternoon when first they came in sight of a  cluster of low mountains.  These were cone-shaped, rising from broad  bases to sharp peaks at the tops.  From a distance the mountains  appeared indistinct and seemed rather small--more like hills than  mountains--but as the travelers drew nearer, they noted a most unusual  circumstance: the hills were all whirling around, some in one direction  and some the opposite way.    \"I guess these are the Merry-Go-Round Mountains, all right,\" said  Dorothy.    \"They must be,\" said the Wizard.    \"They go 'round, sure enough,\" agreed Trot, \"but they don't seem very  merry.\"    There were several rows of these mountains, extending both to the right  and to the left for miles and miles.  How many rows there might be none  could tell, but between the first row of peaks could be seen other  peaks, all steadily whirling around one way or another. Continuing to  ride nearer, our friends watched these hills attentively, until at  last, coming close up, they discovered there was a deep but narrow gulf  around the edge of each mountain, and that the mountains were set so  close together that the outer gulf was continuous and barred farther  advance.  At the edge of the gulf they all dismounted and peered over  into its depths.  There was no telling where the bottom was, if indeed  there was any bottom at all.  From where they stood it seemed as if the  mountains had been set in one great hole in the ground, just close  enough together so they would not touch, and that each mountain was  supported by a rocky column beneath its base which extended far down in  the black pit below.  From the land side it seemed impossible to get  across the gulf or, succeeding in that, to gain a foothold on any of  the whirling mountains.    \"This ditch is too wide to jump across,\" remarked Button-Bright.    \"P'raps the Lion could do it,\" suggested Dorothy.    \"What, jump from here to that whirling hill?\" cried the Lion  indignantly.  \"I should say not!  Even if I landed there and could hold  on, what good would it do?  There's another spinning mountain beyond  it, and perhaps still another beyond that.  I don't believe any living  creature could jump from one mountain to another when both are whirling  like tops and in different directions.\"    \"I propose we turn back,\" said the Wooden Sawhorse with a yawn of his  chopped-out mouth as he stared with his knot eyes at the Merry-Go-Round  Mountains.    \"I agree with you,\" said the Woozy, wagging his square head.    \"We should have taken the shepherd's advice,\" added Hank the Mule.    The others of the party, however they might be puzzled by the serious  problem that confronted them, would not allow themselves to despair.  \"If we once get over these mountains,\" said Button-Bright, \"we could  probably get along all right.\"    \"True enough,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"So we must find some way, of course,  to get past these whirligig hills.  But how?\"    \"I wish the Ork was with us,\" sighed Trot.    \"But the Ork isn't here,\" said the Wizard, \"and we must depend upon  ourselves to conquer this difficulty.  Unfortunately, all my magic has  been stolen, otherwise I am sure I could easily get over the mountains.\"    \"Unfortunately,\" observed the Woozy, \"none of us has wings.  And we're  in a magic country without any magic.\"    \"What is that around your waist, Dorothy?\" asked the Wizard.    \"That?  Oh, that's just the Magic Belt I once captured from the Nome  King,\" she replied.    \"A Magic Belt!   Why, that's fine.  I'm sure a Magic Belt would take  you over these hills.\"    \"It might if I knew how to work it,\" said the little girl.  \"Ozma knows  a lot of its magic, but I've never found out about it.  All I know is  that while I am wearing it, nothing can hurt me.\"    \"Try wishing yourself across and see if it will obey you,\" suggested  the Wizard.    \"But what good would that do?\" asked Dorothy.  \"If I got across, it  wouldn't help the rest of you, and I couldn't go alone among all those  giants and dragons while you stayed here.\"    \"True enough,\" agreed"]]]
