No more humbug!\"    Perenna shrugged his shoulders:    \"Alexandre, you're an ass. Upon my word, the bread of honesty hasn't  enlarged your intelligence. Who talked of starting again?\"    \"But--\"    \"But what?\"    \"All your maneuvers, Chief.\"    \"My maneuvers! Do you think I have anything to say to this business?\"    \"Look here, Chief--\"    \"Why, I'm out of it altogether, my lad! Two hours ago I knew no more  about it than you do. It's Providence that chucked this legacy at me,  without so much as shouting, 'Heads!' And it's in obedience to the  decrees of--\"    \"Then--?\"    \"It's my mission in life to avenge Cosmo Mornington, to find his natural  heirs, to protect them and to divide among them the hundred millions  that belong to them. That's all. Don't you call that the mission of an  honest man?\"    \"Yes, but--\"    \"Yes, but, if I don't fulfil it as an honest man: is that what you mean?\"    \"Chief--\"    \"Well, my lad, if you notice the least thing in my conduct that  dissatisfies you, if you discover a speck of black on Don Luis Perenna's  conscience, examined under the magnifying glass, don't hesitate: collar  me with both hands. I authorize you to do it. I order you to do it. Is  that enough for you?\"    \"It's not enough for it to be enough for me, Chief.\"    \"What are you talking about?\"    \"There are the others.\"    \"Explain yourself.\"    \"Suppose you're nabbed?\"    \"How?\"    \"You can be betrayed.\"    \"By whom?\"    \"Your old mates.\"    \"Gone away. I've sent them out of France.\"    \"Where to?\"    \"That's my secret. I left you at the police office, in case I should  require your services; and you see that I was right.\"    \"But suppose the police discover your real identity?\"    \"Well?\"    \"They'll arrest you.\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"Why?\"    \"They can't arrest me.\"    \"For what reason?\"    \"You've said it yourself, fat-head: a first-class, tremendous,  indisputable reason.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"_I'm dead_!\"    Mazeroux seemed staggered. The argument struck him fully. He at once  perceived it, with all its common sense and all its absurdity. And  suddenly he burst into a roar of laughter which bent him in two and  convulsed his doleful features in the oddest fashion:    \"Oh, Chief, just the same as always!... Lord, how funny!... Will I come  along? I should think I would! As often as you like! You're dead and  buried and put out of sight!... Oh, what a joke, what a joke!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hippolyte Fauville, civil engineer, lived on the Boulevard Suchet, near  the fortifications, in a fair-sized private house having on its left a  small garden in which he had built a large room that served as his study.  The garden was thus reduced to a few trees and to a strip of grass along  the railings, which were covered with ivy and contained a gate that  opened on the Boulevard Suchet.    Don Luis Perenna went with Mazeroux to the commissary's office at Passy,  where Mazeroux, on Perenna's instructions, gave his name and asked to  have M. Fauville's house watched during the night by two policemen who  were to arrest any suspicious person trying to obtain admission. The  commissary agreed to the request.    Don Luis and Mazeroux next dined in the neighbourhood. At nine o'clock  they reached the front door of the house.    \"Alexandre,\" said Perenna.    \"Yes, Chief?\"    \"You're not afraid?\"    \"No, Chief. Why should I be?\"    \"Why? Because, in defending M. Fauville and his son, we are attacking  people who have a great interest in doing away with them and because  those people seem pretty wide-awake. Your life, my life: a breath, a  trifle. You're not afraid?\"    \"Chief,\" replied Mazeroux, \"I can't say if I shall ever know what it  means to be afraid. But there's one case in which I certainly shall  never know.\"    \"What case is that, old chap?\"    \"As long as I'm by your side, Chief.\"    And firmly he rang the bell.          CHAPTER THREE    A MAN DOOMED      The door was opened by a manservant. Mazeroux sent in his card.    Hippolyte received the two visitors in his study. The table, on which  stood a movable telephone, was littered with books, pamphlets, and  papers. There were two tall desks, with diagrams and drawings, and some  glass cases containing reduced models, in ivory and steel, of apparatus  constructed or invented by the engineer.    A large sofa stood against the wall. In one corner was a winding  staircase that led to a circular gallery. An electric chandelier hung  from the ceiling.    Mazeroux, after stating his quality and introducing his friend Perenna  as also sent by the Prefect of Police, at once expounded the object of  their visit.    M. Desmalions, he said, was feeling anxious on the score of very serious  indications which he had just received and, without waiting for the next  day's interview, begged M. Fauville to take all the precautions which his  detectives might advise.    Fauville at first displayed a certain ill humour.    \"My precautions are taken, gentlemen, and well taken. And, on the other  hand, I am afraid that your interference may do harm.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"By arousing the attention of my enemies and preventing me, for that  reason, from collecting proofs which I need in order to confound them.\"    \"Can you explain--?\"    \"No, I cannot ... To-morrow, to-morrow morning--not before.\"    \"And if it's too late?\" Don Luis interjected.    \"Too late? To-morrow?\"    \"Inspector Verot told M. Desmalions's secretary that the two murders  would take place to-night. He said it was fatal and irrevocable.\"    \"To-night?\" cried Fauville angrily. \"I tell you no! Not to-night.  I'm sure of that. There are things which I know, aren't there, which  you do not?\"    \"Yes,\" retorted Don Luis, \"but there may also be things which Inspector  Verot knew and which you don't know. He had perhaps learned more of your  enemies' secrets than you did. The proof is that he was suspected, that a  man carrying an ebony walking-stick was seen watching his movements,  that, lastly, he was killed.\"    Hippolyte Fauville's self-assurance decreased. Perenna took advantage of  this to insist; and he insisted to such good purpose that Fauville,  though without withdrawing from his reserve, ended by yielding before a  will that was stronger than his own.    \"Well, but you surely don't intend to spend the night in here?\"    \"We do indeed.\"    \"Why, it's ridiculous! It's sheer waste of time! After all, looking at  things from the worst--And what do you want besides?\"    \"Who lives in the house?\"    \"Who? My wife, to begin with. She has the first floor.\"    \"Mme. Fauville is not threatened?\"    \"No, not at all. It's I who am threatened with death; I and my son  Edmond. That is why, for the past week, instead of sleeping in my regular  bedroom, I have locked myself up in this room. I have given my work as a  pretext; a quantity of writing which keeps me up very late and for which  I need my son's assistance.\"    \"Does he sleep here, then?\"    \"He sleeps above us, in a little room which I have had arranged for him.  The only access to it is by this inner staircase.\"    \"Is he there now?\"    \"Yes, he's asleep.\"    \"How old is he?\"    \"Sixteen.\"    \"But the fact that you have changed your room shows that you feared some  one would attack you. Whom had you in mind? An enemy living in the house?  One of your servants? Or people from the outside? In that case, how could  they get in? The whole question lies in that.\"    \"To-morrow, to-morrow,\" replied Fauville, obstinately. \"I will explain  everything to-morrow--\"    \"Why not to-night?\" Perenna persisted.    \"Because I want proofs, I tell you; because the mere fact of my talking  may have terrible consequences--and I am frightened; yes, I'm  frightened--\"    He was trembling, in fact, and looked so wretched and terrified that Don  Luis insisted no longer.    \"Very well,\" he said, \"I will only ask your permission, for my comrade  and myself, to spend the night where we can hear you if you call.\"    \"As you please, Monsieur. Perhaps, after all, that will be best.\"    At that moment one of the servants knocked and came in to say that his  mistress wished to see the master before she went out. Madame Fauville  entered almost immediately. She bowed pleasantly as Perenna and Mazeroux  rose from their chairs.    She was a woman between thirty and thirty-five, a woman of a bright and  smiling beauty, which she owed to her blue eyes, to her wavy hair, to all  the charm of her rather vapid but amiable and very pretty face. She wore  a long, figured-silk cloak over an evening dress that showed her fine  shoulders.    Her husband said, in surprise    \"Are you going out to-night?\"    \"You forget,\" she said. \"The Auverards offered me a seat in their box at  the opera; and you yourself asked me to look in at Mme. d'Ersingen's  party afterward--\"    \"So I did, so I did,\" he said. \"It escaped my memory; I am working so  hard.\"    She finished buttoning her gloves and asked:    \"Won't you come and fetch me at Mme. d'Ersingen's?\"    \"What for?\"    \"They would like it.\"    \"But I shouldn't. Besides, I don't feel well enough.\"    \"Then I'll make your apologies for you.\"    \"Yes, do.\"    She drew her cloak around her with a graceful gesture, and stood for a  few moments, without moving, as though seeking a word of farewell.  Then she said:    \"Edmond's not here! I thought he was working with you?\"    \"He was feeling tired.\"    \"Is he asleep?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I wanted to kiss him good-night.\"    \"No, you would only wake him. And here's your car; so go, dear. Amuse  yourself.\"    \"Oh, amuse myself!\" she said. \"There's not much amusement about the opera  and an evening party.\"    \"Still, it's better than keeping one's room.\"    There was some little constraint. It was obviously one of those  ill-assorted households in which the husband, suffering in health and not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"can succeed in arranging them. For instance, in  the score of the concerto, the piano part, according to my usual custom,  was not yet written down; so, owing to my hurry, you will receive it in my  own very illegible writing. In order that the works may follow as nearly as  possible in their proper order, I have marked the numbers to be placed on  each, as follows:--    Solo Sonata,  Op. 22.  Symphony,     Op. 21.  Septet,       Op. 20.  Concerto,     Op. 19.    I will send you their various titles shortly.    Put me down as a subscriber to Sebastian Bach's works [see Letter 20], and  also Prince Lichnowsky. The arrangement of Mozart's Sonatas as quartets  will do you much credit, and no doubt be profitable also. I wish I could  contribute more to the promotion of such an undertaking, but I am an  irregular man, and too apt, even with the best intentions, to forget  everything; I have, however, mentioned the matter to various people, and I  everywhere find them well disposed towards it. It would be a good thing if  you would arrange the septet you are about to publish as a quintet, with a  flute part, for instance; this would be an advantage to amateurs of the  flute, who have already importuned me on the subject, and who would swarm  round it like insects and banquet on it.    Now to tell you something of myself. I have written a ballet  [\"Prometheus\"], in which the ballet-master has not done his part so well as  might be. The F---- von L---- has also bestowed on us a production which by  no means corresponds with the ideas of his genius conveyed by the newspaper  reports. F---- seems to have taken Herr M---- (Wenzel Mueller?) as his ideal  at the Kusperle, yet without even rising to his level. Such are the fine  prospects before us poor people who strive to struggle upwards! My dear  friend, pray lose no time in bringing the work before the notice of the  public, and write to me soon, that I may know whether by my delay I have  entirely forfeited your confidence for the future. Say all that is civil  and kind to your partner, Kuehnel. Everything shall henceforth be sent  finished, and in quick succession. So now farewell, and continue your  regards for    Your friend and brother,    BEETHOVEN.      22.    TO HERR HOFMEISTER.    Vienna, June, 1801.    I am rather surprised at the communication you have desired your business  agent here to make to me; I may well feel offended at your believing me  capable of so mean a trick. It would have been a very different thing had I  sold my works to rapacious shopkeepers, and then secretly made another good  speculation; but, from _one artist to another_, it is rather a strong  measure to suspect me of such a proceeding! The whole thing seems to be  either a device to put me to the test, or a mere suspicion. In any event I  may tell you that before you received the septet from me I had sent it to  Mr. Salomon in London (to be played at his own concert, which I did solely  from friendship), with the express injunction to beware of its getting into  other hands, as it was my intention to have it engraved in Germany, and, if  you choose, you can apply to him for the confirmation of this. But to give  you a further proof of my integrity, \"I herewith give you the faithful  assurance that I have neither sold the septet, the symphony, the concerto,  nor the sonata to any one but to Messrs. Hofmeister and Kuehnel, and that  they may consider them to be their own exclusive property. And to this I  pledge my honor.\" You may make what use you please of this guarantee.    Moreover, I believe Salomon to be as incapable of the baseness of engraving  the septet as I am of selling it to him. I was so scrupulous in the matter,  that when applied to by various publishers to sanction a pianoforte  arrangement of the septet, I at once declined, though I do not even know  whether you proposed making use of it in this way. Here follow the  long-promised titles of the works. There will no doubt be a good deal to  alter and to amend in them; but this I leave to you. I shall soon expect a  letter from you, and, I hope, the works likewise, which I wish to see  engraved, as others have appeared, and are about to appear, in connection  with these numbers. I look on your statement as founded on mere rumors,  which you have believed with too much facility, or based entirely on  supposition, induced by having perchance heard that I had sent the work to  Salomon; I cannot, therefore, but feel some coolness towards such a  credulous friend, though I still subscribe myself    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      23.    DEDICATION TO DR. SCHMIDT.[1]    1801.    MONSIEUR,--    Je sens parfaitement bien, que la Celebrite de Votre nom ainsi que l'amitie  dont Vous m'honorez, exigeroient de moi la dedicace d'un bien plus  important ouvrage. La seule chose qui a pu me determiner a Vous offrir  celui-ci de preference, c'est qu'il me paroit d'une execution plus facile  et par la meme plus propre a contribuer a la Satisfaction dont Vous  jouissez dans l'aimable Cercle de Votre Famille.--C'est surtout, lorsque  les heureux talents d'une fille cherie se seront developpes davantage, que  je me flatte de voir ce but atteint. Heureux si j'y ai reussi et si dans  cette faible marque de ma haute estime et de ma gratitude Vous reconnoissez  toute la vivacite et la cordialite de mes sentiments.    LOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Grand Trio, Op. 38.]      24.    TO HIS SCHOLAR, FERDINAND RIES.[1]    1801.    DEAR RIES,--    I send you herewith the four parts corrected by me; please compare the  others already written out with these. I also enclose a letter to Count  Browne. I have told him that he must make an advance to you of fifty  ducats, to enable you to get your outfit. This is absolutely necessary, so  it cannot offend him; for after being equipped, you are to go with him to  Baden on the Monday of the ensuing week. I must, however, reproach you for  not having had recourse to me long ago. Am I not your true friend? Why did  you conceal your necessities from me? No friend of mine shall ever be in  need, so long as I have anything myself. I would already have sent you a  small sum, did I not rely on Browne; if he fails us, then apply at once to  your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Ries names 1801 as the date of this letter, and it was no  doubt during that summer that Count Browne was in Baden. Ries's father had  assisted the Beethoven family in every way in his power at the time of the  mother's death.]      25.    TO HERR HOFMEISTER,--LEIPZIG.    Vienna, April 8, 1802.    Do you mean to go post-haste to the devil, gentlemen, by proposing that I  should write _such_ a _sonata_? During the revolutionary fever, a thing of  the kind might have been appropriate, but now, when everything is falling  again into the beaten track, and Bonaparte has concluded a _Concordat_ with  the Pope--such a sonata as this? If it were a _missa pro Sancta Maria a tre  voci_, or a _vesper_, &c., then I would at once take up my pen and write a  _Credo in unum_, in gigantic semibreves. But, good heavens! such a sonata,  in this fresh dawning Christian epoch. No, no!--it won't do, and I will  have none of it.    Now for my answer in quickest _tempo_. The lady can have a sonata from me,  and I am willing to adopt the general outlines of her plan in an  _aesthetical_ point of view, without adhering to the keys named. The price  to be five ducats; for this sum she can keep the work a year for her own  amusement, without either of us being entitled to publish it. After the  lapse of a year, the sonata to revert to me--that is, I can and will then  publish it, when, if she considers it any distinction, she may request me  to dedicate it to her.    I now, gentlemen, commend you to the grace of God. My Sonata [Op. 22] is  well engraved, but you have been a fine time about it! I hope you will  usher my Septet into the world a little quicker, as the P---- is waiting  for it, and you know the Empress has it; and when there are in this  imperial city people like ----, I cannot be answerable for the result; so  lose no time!    Herr ---- [Mollo?] has lately published my Quartets [Op. 18] full of faults  and _errata_, both large and small, which swarm in them like fish in the  sea; that is, they are innumerable. _Questo e un piacere per un  autore_--this is what I call engraving [_stechen_, stinging] with a  vengeance.[1] In truth, my skin is a mass of punctures and scratches from  this fine edition of my Quartets! Now farewell, and think of me as I do of  you. Till death, your faithful    L. V. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: In reference to the musical piracy at that time very prevalent  in Austria.]      26.[1]    TO MY BROTHERS CARL AND JOHANN BEETHOVEN.    Heiligenstadt, Oct. 6, 1802.    Oh! ye who think or declare me to be hostile, morose, and misanthropical,  how unjust you are, and how little you know the secret cause of what  appears thus to you! My heart and mind were ever from childhood prone to  the most tender feelings of affection, and I was always disposed to  accomplish something great. But you must remember that six years ago I was  attacked by an incurable malady, aggravated by unskilful physicians,  deluded from year to year, too, by the hope of relief, and at length forced  to the conviction of a _lasting affliction_ (the cure of which may go on  for years, and perhaps after all prove impracticable).    Born with a passionate and excitable temperament, keenly susceptible to the  pleasures of society, I was yet obliged early in life to isolate myself,  and to pass my existence in solitude. If I at any time resolved to surmount  all this, oh! how cruelly was I again repelled by the experience, sadder  than ever, of my defective hearing!--and yet I found it impossible to say  to others: Speak louder; shout! for I am deaf! Alas! how could I proclaim  the deficiency of a sense which ought to have been more perfect with me  than with other"]]]
