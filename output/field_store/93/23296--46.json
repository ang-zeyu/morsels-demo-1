There was a small family apartment adjoining the room occupied by the  trio, and the air had blown open the door communicating between the two.  A fine young man was now seen sitting near the entrance, who, by his  smiling countenance, was evidently a pleased listener to the  conversation. He rose instantly, and coming through the door, with his  hat in his hand, appeared a tall, graceful youth, of dark complexion,  and sparkling eyes of black, from which the mirth had not entirely  vanished, as he made his bow to the ladies.    \"Mr. Dunwoodie!\" cried Sarah, in surprise; \"I was ignorant of your being  in the house; you will find a cooler seat in this room.\"    \"I thank you,\" replied the young man, \"but I must go and seek your  brother, who placed me there in ambuscade, as he called it, with a  promise of returning an hour ago.\" Without making any further  explanation, the youth bowed politely to the young women, distantly and  with hauteur to the gentleman, and withdrew. Frances followed him into  the hall, and blushing richly, inquired, in a hurried voice,--    \"But why--why do you leave us, Mr. Dunwoodie? Henry must soon return.\"    The gentleman caught one of her hands in his own, and the stern  expression of his countenance gave place to a look of admiration as he  replied,--    \"You managed him famously, my dear little kinswoman; never--no, never,  forget the land of your birth; remember, if you are the granddaughter of  an Englishman, you are, also, the granddaughter of a Peyton.\"    \"Oh!\" returned the laughing girl, \"it would be difficult to forget that,  with the constant lectures on genealogy before us, with which we are  favored by Aunt Jeanette; but why do you go?\"    \"I am on the wing for Virginia, and have much to do.\" He pressed her  hand as he spoke, and looking back, while in the act of closing the  door, exclaimed, \"Be true to your country--be American.\" The ardent girl  kissed her hand to him as he retired, and then instantly applying it  with its beautiful fellow to her burning cheeks, ran into her own  apartment to hide her confusion.    Between the open sarcasm of Frances, and the ill-concealed disdain of  the young man, Colonel Wellmere had felt himself placed in an awkward  predicament; but ashamed to resent such trifles in the presence of his  mistress, he satisfied himself with observing, superciliously, as  Dunwoodie left the room,--    \"Quite a liberty for a youth in his situation; a shop boy with a bundle,  I fancy.\"    The idea of picturing the graceful Peyton Dunwoodie as a shop boy could  never enter the mind of Sarah, and she looked around her in surprise,  when the colonel continued,--    \"This Mr. Dun--Dun--\"    \"Dunwoodie! Oh, no--he is a relation of my aunt,\" cried the young lady,  \"and an intimate friend of my brother; they were at school together, and  only separated in England, when one went into the army, and the other to  a French military academy.\"    \"His money appears to have been thrown away,\" observed the colonel,  betraying the spleen he was unsuccessfully striving to conceal.    \"We ought to hope so,\" added Sarah, with a smile, \"for it is said he  intends joining the rebel army. He was brought in here in a French ship,  and has just been exchanged; you may soon meet him in arms.\"    \"Well, let him--I wish Washington plenty of such heroes;\" and he turned  to a more pleasant subject, by changing the discourse to themselves.    A few weeks after this scene occurred, the army of Burgoyne laid down  their arms. Mr. Wharton, beginning to think the result of the contest  doubtful, resolved to conciliate his countrymen, and gratify himself, by  calling his daughters into his own abode. Miss Peyton consented to be  their companion; and from that time, until the period at which we  commenced our narrative, they had formed one family.    Whenever the main army made any movements, Captain Wharton had, of  course, accompanied it; and once or twice, under the protection of  strong parties, acting in the neighborhood of the Locusts, he had  enjoyed rapid and stolen interviews with his friends. A twelvemonth had,  however, passed without his seeing them, and the impatient Henry had  adopted the disguise we have mentioned, and unfortunately arrived on the  very evening that an unknown and rather suspicious guest was an inmate  of the house, which seldom contained any other than its regular  inhabitants.    \"But do you think he suspects me?\" asked the captain, with anxiety,  after pausing to listen to Caesar's opinion of the Skinners.    \"How should he?\" cried Sarah, \"when your sisters and father could not  penetrate your disguise.\"    \"There is something mysterious in his manner; his looks are too prying  for an indifferent observer,\" continued young Wharton thoughtfully, \"and  his face seems familiar to me. The recent fate of Andre has created much  irritation on both sides. Sir Henry threatens retaliation for his death;  and Washington is as firm as if half the world were at his command. The  rebels would think me a fit subject for their plans just now, should I  be so unlucky as to fall into their hands.\"    \"But my son,\" cried his father, in great alarm, \"you are not a spy; you  are not within the rebel--that is, the American lines; there is nothing  here to spy.\"    \"That might be disputed,\" rejoined the young man, musing. \"Their pickets  were as low as the White Plains when I passed through in disguise. It is  true my purposes are innocent; but how is it to appear? My visit to you  would seem a cloak to other designs. Remember, sir, the treatment you  received not a year since, for sending me a supply of fruit for  the winter.\"    \"That proceeded from the misrepresentations of my kind neighbors,\" said  Mr. Wharton, \"who hoped, by getting my estate confiscated, to purchase  good farms at low prices. Peyton Dunwoodie, however, soon obtained our  discharge; we were detained but a month.\"    \"We!\" repeated the son, in amazement; \"did they take my sisters, also?  Fanny, you wrote me nothing of this.\"    \"I believe,\" said Frances, coloring highly, \"I mentioned the kind  treatment we received from your old friend, Major Dunwoodie; and that he  procured my father's release.\"    \"True; but were you with him in the rebel camp?\"    \"Yes,\" said the father, kindly; \"Fanny would not suffer me to go alone.  Jeanette and Sarah took charge of the Locusts, and this little girl was  my companion, in captivity.\"    \"And Fanny returned from such a scene a greater rebel than ever,\" cried  Sarah, indignantly; \"one would think the hardships her father suffered  would have cured her of such whims.\"    \"What say you to the charge, my pretty sister?\" cried the captain gayly;  \"did Peyton strive to make you hate your king, more than he  does himself?\"    \"Peyton Dunwoodie hates no one,\" said Frances, quickly; then, blushing  at her own ardor, she added immediately, \"he loves you, Henry, I know;  for he has told me so again and again.\"    Young Wharton tapped his sister on the cheek, with a smile, as he asked  her, in an affected whisper, \"Did he tell you also that he loved my  little sister Fanny?\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Frances; and the remnants of the supper-table soon  disappeared under her superintendence.          CHAPTER III           'Twas when the fields were swept of Autumn's store,       And growing winds the fading foliage tore       Behind the Lowmon hill, the short-lived light,       Descending slowly, ushered in the night;       When from the noisy town, with mournful look,       His lonely way the meager peddler took.                                                 --WILSON.    A storm below the highlands of the Hudson, if it be introduced with an  easterly wind, seldom lasts less than two days. Accordingly, as the  inmates of the Locusts assembled, on the following morning, around their  early breakfast, the driving rain was seen to strike in nearly  horizontal lines against the windows of the building, and forbade the  idea of exposing either man or beast to the tempest. Harper was the last  to appear; after taking a view of the state of the weather, he  apologized to Mr. Wharton for the necessity that existed for his  trespassing on his goodness for a longer time. To appearances, the reply  was as courteous as the excuse; yet Harper wore a resignation in his  deportment that was widely different from the uneasy manner of the  father. Henry Wharton had resumed his disguise with a reluctance  amounting to disgust, but in obedience to the commands of his parent. No  communications passed between him and the stranger, after the first  salutations of the morning had been paid by Harper to him, in common  with the rest of the family. Frances had, indeed, thought there was  something like a smile passing over the features of the traveler, when,  on entering the room, he first confronted her brother; but it was  confined to the eyes, seeming to want power to affect the muscles of the  face, and was soon lost in the settled and benevolent expression which  reigned in his countenance, with a sway but seldom interrupted. The eyes  of the affectionate sister were turned in anxiety, for a moment, on her  brother, and glancing again on their unknown guest, "]]]
