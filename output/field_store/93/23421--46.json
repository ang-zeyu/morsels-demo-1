But wisely is it said, that use is second nature; and  the contempt and neglect to which these poor people are used, make the  commonest expression of human sympathy appear a boon and gracious  condescension. While I am speaking of the negro countenance, there is  another beauty which is not at all unfrequent among those I see here--a  finely shaped oval face--and those who know (as all painters and  sculptors, all who understand beauty do) how much expression there is in  the outline of the head, and how very rare it is to see a well-formed  face, will be apt to consider this a higher matter than any colouring of  which, indeed, the red and white one so often admired is by no means the  most rich, picturesque, or expressive. At first the dark colour confounded  all features to my eye, and I could hardly tell one face from another.  Becoming, however, accustomed to the complexion, I now perceive all the  variety among these black countenances that there is among our own race,  and as much difference in features and in expression as among the same  number of whites. There is another peculiarity which I have remarked among  the women here--very considerable beauty in the make of the hands; their  feet are very generally ill made, which must be a natural, and not an  acquired defect, as they seldom injure their feet by wearing shoes. The  figures of some of the women are handsome, and their carriage, from the  absence of any confining or tightening clothing, and the habit they have  of balancing great weights on their heads, erect and good.    At the upper end of the row of houses, and nearest to our overseer's  residence, is the hut of the head driver. Let me explain, by the way, his  office. The negroes, as I before told you, are divided into troops or  gangs, as they are called; at the head of each gang is a driver, who  stands over them, whip in hand, while they perform their daily task, who  renders an account of each individual slave and his work every evening to  the overseer, and receives from him directions for their next day's tasks.  Each driver is allowed to inflict a dozen lashes upon any refractory slave  in the field, and at the time of the offence; they may not, however,  extend the chastisement, and if it is found ineffectual, their remedy lies  in reporting the unmanageable individual either to the head driver or the  overseer; the former of whom has power to inflict three dozen lashes at  his own discretion, and the latter as many as he himself sees fit, within  the number of fifty; which limit, however, I must tell you, is an  arbitrary one on this plantation, appointed by the founder of the estate,  Major ----, Mr. ----'s grandfather, many of whose regulations, indeed I  believe most of them, are still observed in the government of the  plantation. Limits of this sort, however, to the power of either driver,  head driver, or overseer, may or may not exist elsewhere; they are, to a  certain degree, a check upon the power of these individuals; but in the  absence of the master, the overseer may confine himself within the limit  or not, as he chooses--and as for the master himself, where is his limit?  He may, if he likes, flog a slave to death, for the laws which pretend  that he may not are a mere pretence--inasmuch as the testimony of a black  is never taken against a white; and upon this plantation of ours, and a  thousand more, the overseer is the _only_ white man, so whence should come  the testimony to any crime of his? With regard to the oft-repeated  statement, that it is not the owner's interest to destroy his human  property, it answers nothing--the instances in which men, to gratify the  immediate impulse of passion, sacrifice not only their eternal, but their  evident, palpable, positive worldly interest, are infinite. Nothing is  commoner than for a man under the transient influence of anger to  disregard his worldly advantage; and the black slave, whose preservation  is indeed supposed to be his owner's interest, may be, will be, and is  occasionally sacrificed to the blind impulse of passion.    To return to our head driver, or, as he is familiarly called, head man,  Frank--he is second in authority only to the overseer, and exercises rule  alike over the drivers and the gangs, in the absence of the sovereign  white man from the estate, which happens whenever Mr. O---- visits the  other two plantations at Woodville and St. Simons. He is sole master and  governor of the island, appoints the work, pronounces punishments, gives  permission to the men to leave the island (without it they never may do  so), and exercises all functions of undisputed mastery over his fellow  slaves, for you will observe that all this while he is just as much a  slave as any of the rest. Trustworthy, upright, intelligent, he may be  flogged to-morrow if Mr. O---- or Mr. ---- so please it, and sold the next  day like a cart horse, at the will of the latter. Besides his various  other responsibilities, he has the key of all the stores, and gives out  the people's rations weekly; nor is it only the people's provisions that  are put under his charge--meat, which is only given out to them  occasionally, and provisions for the use of the family are also entrusted  to his care. Thus you see, among these _inferior_ creatures, their own  masters yet look to find, surviving all their best efforts to destroy  them--good sense, honesty, self-denial, and all the qualities, mental and  moral, that make one man worthy to be trusted by another. From the  imperceptible, but inevitable effect of the sympathies and influences of  human creatures towards and over each other, Frank's intelligence has  become uncommonly developed by intimate communion in the discharge of his  duty with the former overseer, a very intelligent man, who has only just  left the estate, after managing it for nineteen years; the effect of this  intercourse, and of the trust and responsibility laid upon the man, are  that he is clear-headed, well judging, active, intelligent, extremely well  mannered, and, being respected, he respects himself. He is as ignorant as  the rest of the slaves; but he is always clean and tidy in his person,  with a courteousness of demeanour far removed from servility, and exhibits  a strong instance of the intolerable and wicked injustice of the system  under which he lives, having advanced thus far towards improvement, in  spite of all the bars it puts to progress; and here being arrested, not by  want of energy, want of sense, or any want of his own, but by being held  as another man's property, who can only thus hold him by forbidding him  further improvement. When I see that man, who keeps himself a good deal  aloof from the rest, in his leisure hours looking, with a countenance of  deep thought, as I did to-day, over the broad river, which is to him as a  prison wall, to the fields and forest beyond, not one inch or branch of  which his utmost industry can conquer as his own, or acquire and leave an  independent heritage to his children, I marvel what the thoughts of such a  man may be. I was in his house to-day, and the same superiority in  cleanliness, comfort, and propriety exhibited itself in his dwelling, as  in his own personal appearance, and that of his wife--a most active,  trustworthy, excellent woman, daughter of the oldest, and probably most  highly respected of all Mr. ----'s slaves. To the excellent conduct of  this woman, and indeed every member of her family, both the present and  the last overseer bear unqualified testimony.    As I was returning towards the house, after my long morning's lounge, a  man rushed out of the blacksmith's shop, and catching me by the skirt of  my gown, poured forth a torrent of self-gratulations on having at length  found the 'right missis.' They have no idea, of course, of a white person  performing any of the offices of a servant, and as throughout the whole  Southern country the owner's children are nursed and tended, and sometimes  _suckled_ by their slaves (I wonder how this inferior milk agrees with the  lordly _white_ babies?) the appearance of M---- with my two children had  immediately suggested the idea that she must be the missis. Many of the  poor negroes flocked to her, paying their profound homage under this  impression; and when she explained to them that she was not their owner's  wife, the confusion in their minds seemed very great--Heaven only knows  whether they did not conclude that they had two mistresses, and Mr. ----  two wives; for the privileged race must seem, in their eyes, to have such  absolute masterdom on earth, that perhaps they thought polygamy might be  one of the sovereign white men's numerous indulgences. The ecstacy of the  blacksmith on discovering the 'right missis' at last was very funny, and  was expressed with such extraordinary grimaces, contortions, and  gesticulations, that I thought I should have died of laughing at this  rapturous identification of my most melancholy relation to the poor  fellow.    Having at length extricated myself from the group which forms round me  whenever I stop but for a few minutes, I pursued my voyage of discovery by  peeping into the kitchen garden. I dared do no more; the aspect of the  place would have rejoiced the very soul of Solomon's sluggard of old--a  few cabbages and weeds innumerable filled the neglected looking enclosure,  and I ventured no further than the entrance into its most uninviting  precincts.

Vividness can best be  obtained by a study of the writings of the time, especially of  Bradford's _History of Plymouth_. Use pictures in every possible way and  molding board as well.    Emphasize the lack of true liberty of thought, and lead the children to  understand that persecution was a characteristic of the time and not a  failing of any particular colony or set of colonists.

The Puritans and the Colonists, 1649-60.--In 1649 Charles I was  executed, and for eleven years the Puritans were supreme in England.  During this time the New England colonists governed themselves, and paid  little heed to the wishes and orders of England's rulers. After some  hesitation, the Virginians accepted the authority of Cromwell and the  Puritans. In return they were allowed to govern themselves. In Maryland  the Puritans overturned Baltimore's governor and ruled the province for  some years.    [Sidenote: The Restoration, 1660. _English History for Americans_, 196.]    [Sidenote: The Navigation Laws.]    66. Colonial Policy of Charles II.--In 1660 Charles II became king  of England or was \"restored\" to the throne, as people said at the time.  Almost at once there was a great revival of interest in colonization,  and the new government interfered vigorously in colonial affairs. In  1651 the Puritans had begun the system of giving the English trade only  to English merchants and shipowners. This system was now extended, and  the more important colonial products could be carried only to  English ports.    [Sidenote: Charles II and Massachusetts.]    [Sidenote: Massachusetts and the Quakers. _Higginson_, 80-81.]    67. Attacks on Massachusetts.--The new government was especially  displeased by the independent spirit shown by Massachusetts. Only good  Puritans could vote in that colony, and members of the Church of England  could not even worship as they wished. The Massachusetts people paid no  heed whatever to the navigation laws and asserted that acts of  Parliament had no force in the colony. It chanced that at this time  Massachusetts had placed herself clearly in the wrong by hanging four  persons for no other reason than that they were Quakers. The English  government thought that now the time had come to assert its power. It  ordered the Massachusetts rulers to send other Quakers to England for  trial. But, when this order reached Massachusetts, there were no Quakers  in prison awaiting trial, and none were ever sent to England.    [Sidenote: Charters of Connecticut and Rhode Island, 1662-63.]    [Sidenote: New Haven absorbed by Connecticut.]    68. Connecticut and Rhode Island.--While the English government was  attacking Massachusetts it was giving most liberal charters to  Connecticut and to Rhode Island. Indeed, these charters were so liberal  that they remained the constitutions of the states of Connecticut and  Rhode Island until long after the American Revolution. The Connecticut  charter included New Haven within the limits of the larger colony and  thus put an end to the separate existence of New Haven.    [Illustration: THE OLDEST CHURCH SOUTH OF THE POTOMAC.]    [Sidenote: The English conquest of New Netherland, 1664. _Higginson_.  97-98.]    69. Conquest of New Netherland, 1664.--The English government now  determined to conquer New Netherland. An English fleet sailed to New  Amsterdam. Stuyvesant thumped up and down on his wooden leg. But he was  almost the only man in New Amsterdam who wanted to fight. He soon  surrendered, and New Netherland became an English colony. The Dutch  later recaptured it and held it for a time; but in 1674 they finally  handed it over to England.    [Sidenote: New Netherland given to the Duke of York and Albany.]    70. New York.--Even before the colony was seized in 1664, Charles  II gave it away to his brother James, Duke of York and Albany, who  afterward became king as James II. The name of New Netherland was  therefore changed to New York, and the principal towns were also named  in his honor, New York and Albany. Little else was changed in the  colony. The Dutch were allowed to live very nearly as they had lived  before, and soon became even happier and more contented than they had  been under Dutch rule. Many English settlers now came in. The colony  became rich and prosperous, but the people had little to do with their  own government.    [Sidenote: Origin of New Jersey, 1664.]    [Sidenote: Settlement of New Jersey.]    71. New Jersey.--No sooner had James received New Netherland from  his brother than he hastened to give some of the best portions of it to  two faithful friends, Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley. Their  territory extended from New York harbor to the Delaware River, and was  named New Jersey in honor of Carteret's defense of the island of Jersey  against the Puritans. Colonists at once began coming to the new province  and settled at Elizabethtown.    [Sidenote: East and West Jersey.]    [Sidenote: Prosperity.]    72. Later New Jersey.--Soon New Jersey was divided into two parts,  East Jersey and West Jersey. West Jersey belonged to Lord Berkeley and  he sold it to the Quakers. Not very many years later the Quakers also  bought East Jersey. The New Jersey colonists were always getting"]]]
