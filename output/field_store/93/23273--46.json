It was still only the third month of the war, and the old pre-war ideas  were still alive.    'Of course. But it won't make much difference to them. I shall be earning  a shilling a day, at least.'    'You'd better speak to father, I think,' she replied heavily.    Egbert went to his father-in-law. The elderly man's heart was full of  resentment.    'I should say,' he said rather sourly, 'it is the best thing you could  do.'    Egbert went and joined up immediately, as a private soldier. He was  drafted into the light artillery.    Winifred now had a new duty towards him: the duty of a wife towards a  husband who is himself performing his duty towards the world. She loved  him still. She would always love him, as far as earthly love went. But it  was duty she now lived by. When he came back to her in khaki, a soldier,  she submitted to him as a wife. It was her duty. But to his passion she  could never again fully submit. Something prevented her, for ever: even  her own deepest choice.    He went back again to camp. It did not suit him to be a modern soldier.  In the thick, gritty, hideous khaki his subtle physique was extinguished  as if he had been killed. In the ugly intimacy of the camp his  thoroughbred sensibilities were just degraded. But he had chosen, so he  accepted. An ugly little look came on to his face, of a man who has  accepted his own degradation.    In the early spring Winifred went down to Crockham to be there when  primroses were out, and the tassels hanging on the hazel-bushes. She felt  something like a reconciliation towards Egbert, now he was a prisoner in  camp most of his days. Joyce was wild with delight at seeing the garden  and the common again, after the eight or nine months of London and  misery. She was still lame. She still had the irons up her leg. But she  lurched about with a wild, crippled agility.    Egbert came for a week-end, in his gritty, thick, sand-paper khaki and  puttees and the hideous cap. Nay, he looked terrible. And on his face a  slightly impure look, a little sore on his lip, as if he had eaten too  much or drunk too much or let his blood become a little unclean. He was  almost uglily healthy, with the camp life. It did not suit him.    Winifred waited for him in a little passion of duty and sacrifice,  willing to serve the soldier, if not the man. It only made him feel a  little more ugly inside. The week-end was torment to him: the memory of  the camp, the knowledge of the life he led there; even the sight of his  own legs in that abhorrent khaki. He felt as if the hideous cloth went  into his blood and made it gritty and dirty. Then Winifred so ready to  serve the _soldier_, when she repudiated the man. And this made the grit  worse between his teeth. And the children running around playing and  calling in the rather mincing fashion of children who have nurses and  governesses and literature in the family. And Joyce so lame! It had all  become unreal to him, after the camp. It only set his soul on edge. He  left at dawn on the Monday morning, glad to get back to the realness and  vulgarity of the camp.    Winifred would never meet him again at the cottage--only in London, where  the world was with them. But sometimes he came alone to Crockham perhaps  when friends were staying there. And then he would work awhile in his  garden. This summer still it would flame with blue anchusas and big red  poppies, the mulleins would sway their soft, downy erections in the air:  he loved mulleins: and the honeysuckle would stream out scent like  memory, when the owl was whooing. Then he sat by the fire with the  friends and with Winifred's sisters, and they sang the folk-songs. He put  on thin civilian clothes and his charm and his beauty and the supple  dominancy of his body glowed out again. But Winifred was not there.    At the end of the summer he went to Flanders, into action. He seemed  already to have gone out of life, beyond the pale of life. He hardly  remembered his life any more, being like a man who is going to take a  jump from a height, and is only looking to where he must land.    He was twice slightly wounded, in two months. But not enough to put him  off duty for more than a day or two. They were retiring again, holding  the enemy back. He was in the rear--three machine-guns. The country was  all pleasant, war had not yet trampled it. Only the air seemed shattered,  and the land awaiting death. It was a small, unimportant action in which  he was engaged.    The guns were stationed on a little bushy hillock just outside a village.  But occasionally, it was difficult to say from which direction, came the  sharp crackle of rifle-fire, and beyond, the far-off thud of cannon. The  afternoon was wintry and cold.    A lieutenant stood on a little iron platform at the top of the ladders,  taking the sights and giving the aim, calling in a high, tense,  mechanical voice. Out of the sky came the sharp cry of the directions,  then the warning numbers, then 'Fire!' The shot went, the piston of the  gun sprang back, there was a sharp explosion, and a very faint film of  smoke in the air. Then the other two guns fired, and there was a lull.  The officer was uncertain of the enemy's position. The thick clump of  horse-chestnut trees below was without change. Only in the far distance  the sound of heavy firing continued, so far off as to give a sense of  peace.    The gorse bushes on either hand were dark, but a few sparks of flowers  showed yellow. He noticed them almost unconsciously as he waited, in the  lull. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the air came chill on his arms.  Again his shirt was slit on the shoulders, and the flesh showed through.  He was dirty and unkempt. But his face was quiet. So many things go out  of consciousness before we come to the end of consciousness.    Before him, below, was the highroad, running between high banks of grass  and gorse. He saw the whitish muddy tracks and deep scores in the road,  where the part of the regiment had retired. Now all was still. Sounds  that came, came from the outside. The place where he stood was still  silent, chill, serene: the white church among the trees beyond seemed  like a thought only.    He moved into a lightning-like mechanical response at the sharp cry from  the officer overhead. Mechanism, the pure mechanical action of obedience  at the guns. Pure mechanical action at the guns. It left the soul  unburdened, brooding in dark nakedness. In the end, the soul is alone,  brooding on the face of the uncreated flux, as a bird on a dark sea.    Nothing could be seen but the road, and a crucifix knocked slanting and  the dark, autumnal fields and woods. There appeared three horsemen on a  little eminence, very small, on the crest of a ploughed field. They were  our own men. Of the enemy, nothing.    The lull continued. Then suddenly came sharp orders, and a new direction  of the guns, and an intense, exciting activity. Yet at the centre the  soul remained dark and aloof, alone.    But even so, it was the soul that heard the new sound: the new, deep  'papp!' of a gun that seemed to touch right upon the soul. He kept up the  rapid activity at the machine-gun, sweating. But in his soul was the echo  of the new, deep sound, deeper than life.    And in confirmation came the awful faint whistling of a shell, advancing  almost suddenly into a piercing, tearing shriek that would tear through  the membrane of life. He heard it in his ears, but he heard it also in  his soul, in tension. There was relief when the thing had swung by and  struck, away beyond. He heard the hoarseness of its explosion, and the  voice of the soldier calling to the horses. But he did not turn round to  look. He only noticed a twig of holly with red berries fall like a gift  on to the road below.    Not this time, not this time. Whither thou goest I will go. Did he say it  to the shell, or to whom? Whither thou goest I will go. Then, the faint  whistling of another shell dawned, and his blood became small and still  to receive it. It drew nearer, like some horrible blast of wind; his  blood lost consciousness. But in the second of suspension he saw the  heavy shell swoop to earth, into the rocky bushes on the right, and earth  and stones poured up into the sky. It was as if he heard no sound. The  earth and stones and fragments of bush fell to earth again, and there was  the same unchanging peace. The Germans had got the aim.    Would they move now? Would they retire? Yes. The officer was giving the  last lightning-rapid orders to fire before withdrawing. A shell passed  unnoticed in the rapidity of action. And then, into the silence, into the  suspense where the soul brooded, finally crashed a noise and a darkness  and a moment's flaming agony and horror. Ah, he had seen the dark bird  flying towards him, flying home this time. In one instant life and  eternity went up in a conflagration of agony, then there was a weight of  darkness.    When faintly something began to struggle in the darkness, a consciousness  of himself, he was aware of a great load and a clanging sound. To have  known the moment of death! And to be forced, before dying, to review it.  So, fate, even in death.    There was a resounding of pain. It seemed to sound from the outside of  his consciousness: like a loud bell clanging very near. Yet he knew it  was himself. He must associate himself with it. After a lapse and a new  effort, he identified a pain in his head, a large pain that clanged and  resounded. So far he could identify himself with himself. Then there was  a lapse.    After a time he seemed to wake up again, and waking, to know that he was  at the front, and that he was killed. He did not open his eyes. Light was  not yet his. The clanging pain in his head rang out the rest of his  consciousness.

To insure the efficiency of mill-saws, it is highly important to have  them firmly secured in the frames by which they are reciprocated.  Swing-frames for carrying saws are ordinarily of wrought iron or steel,  and made up of several pieces mortised and tenoned together in the form  of a rectangular frame or parallelogram, of which the longest sides are  termed verticals and the shortest crossheads or crossrails. In the case  of deal frames, the swing frame differs somewhat from that of a timber  frame, in having two extra verticals, which separate it into two equal  divisions. These are necessary in order that two deals may be operated  upon simultaneously, each division being devoted to a separate deal, and  likewise to enable the connecting-rod which works the frame to pass up  the center and oscillate on a pin near the top, thereby avoiding the  deep excavations and costly foundations required where the rod is  engaged with the pin at the bottom. The rack that advances the deals to  the saws passes through a \"bow\" in the connecting-rod and the middle  of the frame, the deals are placed on either side of it, on rollers  purposely provided. In sawing hard deals, the saws require to be  sharpened about every tenth run or journey, and every twentieth for  soft. Fifty runs, or one hundred deals, are reckoned an average day's  work; this is inclusive of the time required for changing the saws,  returning the rack for another run, and other exigencies. For attachment  to swing-frames the saws have buckles riveted to them; these are by  various modes connected to the crossheads. Each top buckle is passed  through the crosshead and is pierced with a mortise for the reception  of a thin steel wedge or key, by whose agency the blade is strained and  tightened. The edge of the crosshead upon which the keys bed is steeled  to lessen the wear invariably ensuing from frequently driving up the  keys. The distances between the blades are adjusted by interposing  strips of wood, or packing pieces, as they are termed, of equal  thickness with the required boards or leaves; the whole is then pressed  together and held in position by packing screws. The saws themselves are  subsequently tightened by forcing home the keys until a certain amount  of tension has been attained, this is ascertained only by the peculiar  sound which emanates from the blade on being drawn considerably tight  and tense. Great experience is required to accustom the ear to the  correct intonation, as in general the tensile strain on the saws  approximates so closely to the breaking point that one or two extra taps  on the keys are quite sufficient to rupture them.    Mr. Brunel, in the government saw-mills at Woolwich, adopted a method  of hanging saws by means of a weighted lever, like a Roman steelyard.  A cross-shaft affixed above the saws to the cornice of the main frame  carried a lever, weighted at one end and provided with a hook or shackle  at the other for engagement with the saw buckle. In using this apparatus  the blades were strained one at a time by linking the lever to the  buckle and then adjusting the movable weight until the desired tension  was acquired, after which the key was inserted into the mortise and the  lever released. This arrangement is not now in common use on account of  the trouble attending its employment, and at present the saws are merely  strained by hammering up the keys. The saw blades had usually a tensile  strain of upwards of one tun per inch of breadth of blade. It is to  be further observed that the cutting edges of the saws are not quite  perpendicular, but have a little lead, or their upper ends overhang the  lower about three eighths of an inch or one half of an inch, according  to the nature of the material to be sawn. The object of this is that the  saws may be withdrawn from the cuts in the ascending or back stroke, and  allow the sawdust free escape. The eccentric actuating the mechanism for  advancing the timber to the saws is generally set in such a manner that  the feed commences just at the moment when the frame has attained half  its ascending stroke, and continues until the entire stroke has been  completed. By this regulation the saws are not liable to be suddenly  choked, but come smoothly and softly into their work.--_Worssam's  Mechanical Saws_.           *       *       *       *       *          PATENT DECISION.      _In the matter of the application of William N. Bartholomew, assignor  to J. Reckendorfer, for letters patent for a design for Rubber  Eraser_--Letters patent for designs have increased in importance within  the past few years. Formerly but few were granted, now many are issued.  To this day they have made so little figure in litigation that but  three reported cases are known in which design patents have come into  controversy. With their increase, questions have arisen concerning their  scope and character, which have given rise to dispute and to inquiry as  to the correctness of the current practice of the office in this branch  of invention. While on the one hand, it is insisted that the practice  has always been uniform, and is therefore now fixed and definite; on the  other, it is asserted, that there has never been, and is not now, any  well-defined or uniform practice, either in the granting or refusal of  design patents.    The act of 1836 made no provision for the patenting of designs. The  earliest legislation upon this subject is found in the act of August 29,  1842, section 3; and the only legislation upon the subject is found  in this section and in section 11, of the act of March 2, 1861. The  definition of the subject matter, or, in other words, of a \"design,\" is  the same in both acts. It is is follows:    \"That any citizen, etc., who, by his, her, or their own industry,  genius, efforts, and expense, may have invented or produced any new and  original design for a manufacture, whether of metal or other material  or materials, any original design for a bust, statue, bas-relief, or  composition in alto or basso-relievo, or any new and original impression  being formed in marble or other material, or any new and useful pattern,  or print, or picture, to be either worked into or worked on, or printed,  or painted, or cast, or otherwise fixed on any article of manufacture,  or any new and original shape or configuration of any article of  manufacture not known or used by others, etc.\"    This definition embraces five particulars.    1. A new and original design for a manufacture.    2. An original design for a bust, statue, etc.    3. A new and original impression or ornament to be placed on any article  of manufacture.    4. A new and useful pattern, print, or picture to be worked into or  worked on, or printed, or painted, or cast, or otherwise fixed on any  article of manufacture.    5. A new and original shape or configuration of any article of  manufacture.    The first three of these classes would seem to refer to ornament only;  the fourth to ornament, combined with utility, as in the case of trade  marks; and the fifth to new shapes or forms of manufactured articles,  which, for some reason, were preferable to those previously adopted.    The disputed questions which have thus far arisen under these  definitions are:    1. What variations may be claimed or covered by the patent consistently  with unity of design.    2. Is a new shape of an article of manufacture, whereby utility is  secured, a subject of protection under this act; and    3. Is mechanical function of any kind covered by it.    As to the first of these questions, it seems to have been assumed that  the design spoken of in all parts of the sections referred to covered a  fixed, unchangeable figure, that the protection of letters patent did  not extend to any variation, however slight, but that such variation  constituted a new design, might be covered by a new patent, and might  safely be used without infringement of the first. This, it is said, is  the correct theory of the law, and has been the uniform adjudication of  the Office.    Neither of these statements is absolutely correct. The law by no means  defines a design with such strictness. The language is, \"new and  original design for a manufacture,\" \"new and original impression or  ornament,\" \"new and original shape or configuration.\" It would seem to  be too plain for argument, that the new design, or impression, or shape,  might be so generic in its character as to admit of many variations,  which should embody the substantial characteristics and be entirely  consistent with a substantial identity of form. Thus, if the invention  were of a design for an ornamental button, the face of which was grooved  with radial rays, it would seem that the first designer of such a button  might properly describe a button of five rays, and, having stated that  a greater number of rays might be used, might claim a design consisting  generally of radial rays, or of \"five or more\" rays, and, that it could  not be necessary for him to take out a patent for each additional  ray that could be cut upon his button. So, if the design were the  ornamentation of long combs by a chain of pearls, it would seem that a  claim for such a design might be maintained against one who arranged  the pearls, either in curved or straight lines, or who used half pearls  only, and that such modifications if they had occurred to the designer,  might properly have been enumerated in his specification as possible and  equivalent variations. In short, I can see no reason, under the law, why  designs may not be generic, why what are called \"broad claims,\" may  not be made to them, and why the doctrine of artistic or aesthetic  equivalents may not be applied to them.    This has been recognized to a greater or less extent in the  adjudications of the courts and in the practice of the Office.    One of the reported cases"]]]
