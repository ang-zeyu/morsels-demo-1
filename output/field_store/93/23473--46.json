And therefore considering the vast       charge of rebuilding the fallen tower and repairing the       other, he thought the best way was to pull down both       together, with the west arch of the nave of the church       between them; and to lengthen the two northern isles to       answer exactly to the two southern; and then to close all       with a well designed and fair built west end and porch;       which would make the west end of the church look much       handsome than ever it did, and would be done with half the       charge.\" [21]        [20] \"Early Statutes,\" p. 21.    [21] Walcott, \"Early Statutes\" p. 21    Such was Dr. Wren's opinion of the west front. It is fortunate that  his advice was not followed, for have we not the same west front still  in existence? However, Wren spoke of \"the remaining part of the tower  now standing,\" and King's print, publishing 1656, shows the portion to  which he referred. Fuller [22] remarked in 1662 that the church \"now is  torn, having lately a great part thereof fallen to the ground.\" He no  doubt refers to the same ruin, for it is not to be conjectured that  any other part fell then.      [22] \"Worthies,\" II, 385    Sir Christopher Wren says the towers never were alike in design, nor  were they \"both built together.\"    The edition of Dugdale's \"Monasticon,\" published in 1673, gives a view  of the north facade of the church. Ede, writing in 1684, said that  \"above fifty years\" before one-third part of the north-west tower had  fallen from top to bottom; yet this illustration shows that same tower  complete. This affords an opportunity of comparing portions of the two  towers. The upper part of each is shown to finish on top with a  battlement parapet. It is evidence in itself that during the fifteenth  century certain alterations had been effected in them both at this  part. But this print must have been made from an original which had  been executed quite twenty years earlier--for King's drawing, issued  in 1656, shows the north-west tower already partly destroyed; so it is  necessary to conclude that the drawing for the \"Monasticon\" was done  before 1656, but after 1610, when Speed's map, or bird's-eye view, of  the city was brought out.    Praecentor Walcott has supposed that the two towers in Chichester  referred to in the \"Annals of Dunstable\" as having fallen during the  year 1210 were the two at the west end.    [Illustration: CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, ABOUT 1650.]    But taking Sir Christopher Wren's report with the discovery made by  Mr. Sharpe in 1853, quoted by Professor Willis, it would seem rather  that those two towers were the original central tower and that at the  south-west angle of the west front.    Wren in writing of the tower at the north-west, which had fallen about  1630-1640, said that it had not been built at the same date nor in the  same manner as the other then remaining to the south of the same  front. The upper part of the central tower itself had been built  perhaps during the second quarter of the fourteenth century or even  earlier. Consequently it seems probable that the two towers which fell  in 1210 were the original twelfth-century central tower and that of  the same date to the south of the west front. In Speed's map of 1610  both the western towers are represented as having small spires.    Hollar's print in the \"Monasticon\" shows what appear to be some  fifteenth-century buttresses to the north-west tower; but in  excavating for the foundations of the new north-west tower, now  completed, no traces of any projecting buttresses were discovered, so  it may be that it was the original twelfth-century tower which fell  about 1630, and the peculiar character of its masonry suggested the  remark to Wren when he said it so distinctly differed from its  companion.    Towards the close of the seventeenth century the central spire was in  an unstable condition, and Elmes, in his \"Life,\" says of Wren that he        \"took down and rebuilt the upper part of the spire of the      cathedral, and fixed therein a pendulum stage to counteract      the effects of the south and the south-westerly gales of      wind, which act with some considerable power against it, and      had forced it from its perpendicularity.\"    It is interesting to have this record, for the spire during the  following century was still a cause of trouble.    Spershott's memoirs show that about 1725         \"a new chamber organ was added to the choir of the       cathedral, the tubes of which were at first bright like       silver, but are now like old tarnished brass.\"    Whether this organ contained any parts of that which was destroyed in  the previous century is not known; but many old prints and drawings  show that the case of the one that was now built on the top of the  Arundel screen was quite as beautifully designed as the one in Exeter  Cathedral, or King's College Chapel at Cambridge.    About 1749 the Duke of Richmond's vault was \"diged and made\" [23] in the  lady-chapel, and ten years later \"the kings and bishops in the  cathedral\" were \"new painted.\" The floor of the lady-chapel was raised  to give height to the vault beneath, and a fireplace and chimney built  up in front of the east window. Portions of the other windows were  plastered up, and so left only partly filled with glass. These served  to provide light in what was now to be the library, since, apparently,  the originally well-lighted library, above the chamber now used for  the purpose, had lost its proper roof and been otherwise made useless.      [23] Spershott.    There is little else to be said concerning the history of the building  during eighteenth century; but it is stated by a careful observer, [24]  writing in 1803, that \"in the interior of this cathedral few  innovations have been effected.\" He says that the east window of the  lady-chapel is plastered up, and that         \"we find that the great window in the west front of the       cathedral has a short time back had its mullions and other       works knocked out, and your common masoned 'muntings'       (mullions) and transoms stuck up in their room, without any       tracery sweeps or turns, of the second and third degrees;       which work may before long be construed by some shallow       dabblers in architectural matters into the classical and       chaste productions of our old workmen. On the north and       south sides of the church are buttresses, with rare and       uncommon octangular-columned terminations; but they have       likewise, to save a trifling expense in reparation, been       deprived of their principal embellishments, and are now       capped with vulgar house-coping....         \"It may be well to speak of the west porch as an excellent       performance; and the statue over the double entrance is       remarkably so.\"      [24] _Gentleman's Magazine_, Part I., 1803, pp. 22-25.    Proceeding, the same writer relates that:         \"Against the east and west walls of the said transept are       affixed historic paintings; those on the west side (the       figures as large as life) relate to the founding of the       church and its re-edification in Henry viii.'s time. Among       the various portraits is that of Henry viii. himself. Here       are also in separate circular compartments, the quarter       portraits of our kings, from William the Conqueror to Hen.       viii. (and since his day, in continuation to George i.) On       the east side is the entire collection of the ancient       bishops of the see (quarter lengths, and in circular       compartments). A short time back the faces of the several       portraits were touched upon by some unskilful hand; however       we have before us most curious specimens of the costume of       Henry's day, when the whole of these paintings were done       (excepting those of subsequent dates), in dresses, warlike       habiliments, buildings, etc....         \"Looking towards the north, on the outside of the choir, is       the monumental chapel and tomb of St. Richard. The groins       above are embellished with paintings of foliage, arms, etc.,       conveying the eye over the choir; thence into the north       transept, intercepted in the way by the galleries over the       side-aisles, when the general combination of objects is       terminated by the north transept window, which, though       inferior to the southern window, still has its own peculiar       attractions.\"    At the time these words were written the north porch was in a wrecked  condition. Both gables of the transept were in ruins, and the  high-pitched roofs of the old library, the lady-chapel, and the south  arm of the transept were absent altogether.    But soon the authorities began to take some interest in the condition  of the building. James Elmes had been called in to deal with the spire  in 1813-1814, and under his direction the \"useful piece of machinery\"  which had been put there by Wren was \"taken down and reinstated.\" In  his \"Life of Wren\" an illustration is given of the device, which he  had carefully examined and measured. He describes it thus:         \"To the finial is fastened a strong metal ring, and to that       is suspended a large piece of yellow fir-timber eighty feet       long and thirteen inches square; the masonry at the apex of       the spire, being from nine to six inches thick, diminishing       as it rises. The pendulum is loaded with iron, adding all       its weight to the finial, and has two stout solid oak       floors, the lower one smaller by about three, and the upper       one by about two and a quarter inches, than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#8)"],[1,"in one of  these rifle-pits to apprise the men of his intention Searing crept  stealthily forward on his hands and knees and was soon lost to view in a  dense thicket of underbrush.    \"That is the last of him,\" said one of the men; \"I wish I had his rifle;  those fellows will hurt some of us with it.\"    Searing crept on, taking advantage of every accident of ground and  growth to give himself better cover. His eyes penetrated everywhere, his  ears took note of every sound. He stilled his breathing, and at the  cracking of a twig beneath his knee stopped his progress and hugged the  earth. It was slow work, but not tedious; the danger made it exciting,  but by no physical signs was the excitement manifest. His pulse was as  regular, his nerves were as steady as if he were trying to trap a  sparrow.    \"It seems a long time,\" he thought, \"but I cannot have come very far; I  am still alive.\"    He smiled at his own method of estimating distance, and crept forward. A  moment later he suddenly flattened himself upon the earth and lay  motionless, minute after minute. Through a narrow opening in the bushes  he had caught sight of a small mound of yellow clay--one of the enemy's  rifle-pits. After some little time he cautiously raised his head, inch  by inch, then his body upon his hands, spread out on each side of him,  all the while intently regarding the hillock of clay. In another moment  he was upon his feet, rifle in hand, striding rapidly forward with  little attempt at concealment. He had rightly interpreted the signs,  whatever they were; the enemy was gone.    To assure himself beyond a doubt before going back to report upon so  important a matter, Searing pushed forward across the line of abandoned  pits, running from cover to cover in the more open forest, his eyes  vigilant to discover possible stragglers. He came to the edge of a  plantation--one of those forlorn, deserted homesteads of the last years  of the war, upgrown with brambles, ugly with broken fences and desolate  with vacant buildings having blank apertures in place of doors and  windows. After a keen reconnoissance from the safe seclusion of a clump  of young pines Searing ran lightly across a field and through an orchard  to a small structure which stood apart from the other farm buildings, on  a slight elevation. This he thought would enable him to overlook a large  scope of country in the direction that he supposed the enemy to have  taken in withdrawing. This building, which had originally consisted of a  single room elevated upon four posts about ten feet high, was now little  more than a roof; the floor had fallen away, the joists and planks  loosely piled on the ground below or resting on end at various angles,  not wholly torn from their fastenings above. The supporting posts were  themselves no longer vertical. It looked as if the whole edifice would  go down at the touch of a finger.    Concealing himself in the debris of joists and flooring Searing looked  across the open ground between his point of view and a spur of Kennesaw  Mountain, a half-mile away. A road leading up and across this spur was  crowded with troops--the rear-guard of the retiring enemy, their  gun-barrels gleaming in the morning sunlight.    Searing had now learned all that he could hope to know. It was his duty  to return to his own command with all possible speed and report his  discovery. But the gray column of Confederates toiling up the mountain  road was singularly tempting. His rifle--an ordinary \"Springfield,\" but  fitted with a globe sight and hair-trigger--would easily send its ounce  and a quarter of lead hissing into their midst. That would probably not  affect the duration and result of the war, but it is the business of a  soldier to kill. It is also his habit if he is a good soldier. Searing  cocked his rifle and \"set\" the trigger.    But it was decreed from the beginning of time that Private Searing was  not to murder anybody that bright summer morning, nor was the  Confederate retreat to be announced by him. For countless ages events  had been so matching themselves together in that wondrous mosaic to some  parts of which, dimly discernible, we give the name of history, that the  acts which he had in will would have marred the harmony of the pattern.  Some twenty-five years previously the Power charged with the execution  of the work according to the design had provided against that mischance  by causing the birth of a certain male child in a little village at the  foot of the Carpathian Mountains, had carefully reared it, supervised  its education, directed its desires into a military channel, and in due  time made it an officer of artillery. By the concurrence of an infinite  number of favoring influences and their preponderance over an infinite  number of opposing ones, this officer of artillery had been made to  commit a breach of discipline and flee from his native country to avoid  punishment. He had been directed to New Orleans (instead of New York),  where a recruiting officer awaited him on the wharf. He was enlisted and  promoted, and things were so ordered that he now commanded a Confederate  battery some two miles along the line from where Jerome Searing, the  Federal scout, stood cocking his rifle. Nothing had been neglected--at  every step in the progress of both these men's lives, and in the lives  of their contemporaries and ancestors, and in the lives of the  contemporaries of their ancestors, the right thing had been done to  bring about the desired result. Had anything in all this vast  concatenation been overlooked Private Searing might have fired on the  retreating Confederates that morning, and would perhaps have missed. As  it fell out, a Confederate captain of artillery, having nothing better  to do while awaiting his turn to pull out and be off, amused himself by  sighting a field-piece obliquely to his right at what he mistook for  some Federal officers on the crest of a hill, and discharged it. The  shot flew high of its mark.    As Jerome Searing drew back the hammer of his rifle and with his eyes  upon the distant Confederates considered where he could plant his shot  with the best hope of making a widow or an orphan or a childless  mother,--perhaps all three, for Private Searing, although he had  repeatedly refused promotion, was not without a certain kind of  ambition,--he heard a rushing sound in the air, like that made by the  wings of a great bird swooping down upon its prey. More quickly than he  could apprehend the gradation, it increased to a hoarse and horrible  roar, as the missile that made it sprang at him out of the sky, striking  with a deafening impact one of the posts supporting the confusion of  timbers above him, smashing it into matchwood, and bringing down the  crazy edifice with a loud clatter, in clouds of blinding dust!    When Jerome Searing recovered consciousness he did not at once  understand what had occurred. It was, indeed, some time before he opened  his eyes. For a while he believed that he had died and been buried, and  he tried to recall some portions of the burial service. He thought that  his wife was kneeling upon his grave, adding her weight to that of the  earth upon his breast. The two of them, widow and earth, had crushed his  coffin. Unless the children should persuade her to go home he would not  much longer be able to breathe. He felt a sense of wrong. \"I cannot  speak to her,\" he thought; \"the dead have no voice; and if I open my  eyes I shall get them full of earth.\"    He opened his eyes. A great expanse of blue sky, rising from a fringe of  the tops of trees. In the foreground, shutting out some of the trees, a  high, dun mound, angular in outline and crossed by an intricate,  patternless system of straight lines; the whole an immeasurable distance  away--a distance so inconceivably great that it fatigued him, and he  closed his eyes. The moment that he did so he was conscious of an  insufferable light. A sound was in his ears like the low, rhythmic  thunder of a distant sea breaking in successive waves upon the beach,  and out of this noise, seeming a part of it, or possibly coming from  beyond it, and intermingled with its ceaseless undertone, came the  articulate words: \"Jerome Searing, you are caught like a rat in a trap--  in a trap, trap, trap.\"    Suddenly there fell a great silence, a black darkness, an infinite  tranquillity, and Jerome Searing, perfectly conscious of his rathood,  and well assured of the trap that he was in, remembering all and nowise  alarmed, again opened his eyes to reconnoitre, to note the strength of  his enemy, to plan his defense.    He was caught in a reclining posture, his back firmly supported by a  solid beam. Another lay across his breast, but he had been able to  shrink a little away from it so that it no longer oppressed him, though  it was immovable. A brace joining it at an angle had wedged him against  a pile of boards on his left, fastening the arm on that side. His legs,  slightly parted and straight along the ground, were covered upward to  the knees with a mass of debris which towered above his narrow horizon.  His head was as rigidly fixed as in a vise; he could move his eyes, his  chin--no more. Only his right arm was partly free. \"You must help us out  of this,\" he said to it. But he could not get it from under the heavy  timber athwart his chest, nor move it outward more than six inches at  the elbow.    Searing was not seriously injured, nor did he suffer pain. A smart rap  on the head from a flying fragment of the splintered post, incurred  simultaneously with the frightfully sudden shock to the nervous system,  had momentarily dazed him. His term of unconsciousness, including the  period of recovery, during which he had had the strange fancies, had  probably not exceeded a few seconds, for the dust of the wreck had not  wholly cleared away as he began an intelligent survey of the situation.
