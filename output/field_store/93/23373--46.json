Ay, though he's buried in a cave,    And trodden down with stones,  And years have rotted off his flesh--    The world shall see his bones!    \"Oh God, that horrid, horrid dream    Besets me now awake!  Again--again, with a dizzy brain,    The human life I take;  And my red right hand grows raging hot,    Like Cranmer's at the stake.    \"And still no peace for the restless clay    Will wave or mould allow;  The horrid thing pursues my soul,--    It stands before me now!\"  The fearful boy looked up, and saw    Huge drops upon his brow!    That very night, while gentle sleep    The urchin eyelids kiss'd,  Two stern-fac'd men set out from Lynn,    Through the cold and heavy mist;  And Eugene Aram walked between,    With gyves upon his wrist.      Mr. Planche's versification of the homely proverb--Poverty parts good  company--will create many good-natured smiles, and run counter with Mr.  Kenney's To-morrow. Some of the minor pieces are very pleasing,  especially two by Hartley Coleridge, Esq.    We confess we do not admire the taste which dictated Mr. C. Lamb's  Widow; it is in every respect unworthy of the plate, and the feelings  created by the two are very discordant. We love a joke, but to call a  widow's sables a perpetual \"black joke,\" disgusts rather than pleases  us. The Funeral of General Crawford, by the author of The Subaltern is  an affecting incident; and Nina St. Morin, by the author of May You Like  It, is of the same character. Catching a Tartar, by Mansie Wauch, and  the Station, an Irish Story, are full of humour; and May Day, by the  editor, abounds with oddities. Thus, \"the golden age is not to be  regilt; pastoral is gone out, and Pan extinct--pans will not last for  ever;\" \"horticultural hose, _pruned_ so often at top to _graft_ at  bottom, that from long stockings they had dwindled into short socks;\"  \"the contrast of a large marquee in canvass with the long lawn;\" \"Pan's  sister, Patty, the wags called _Patty Pan_,\" &c. One of the finest  stories in the _Gem_ is the Rival Dreamers, by Mr. Banim; and curious  enough, this is the third Annual in which we have met with the same  legend. The present version is, however, the best narrative, which such  of our readers as know the O'Hara Family will readily believe. We could  abridge it for our present space; but it would be injustice to the  author to pare down his beautiful descriptions; and we will endeavour to  give place to the tale in a future Number. The Last Embarkation of the  Doge of Venice is interesting; almost every incident connected with that  huge pleasure-house is attractive, but one of the present, the Marriage  of the Sea, is well told. The Shearmen's Miracle Play smacks pleasantly  of \"the good old times\" of merry England. Miss Mitford has contributed  two of her inimitable sketches--Harry Lewington and his Dog, and Tom  Hopkins--the latter an excellent portrait of \"the loudest, if not the  greatest man\" in the little town of Cranley. We must give the village  lion, in little:--           *       *       *       *       *      TOM HOPKINS.      At the time of which I speak, Tom Hopkins was of an age somewhat  equivocal; public fame called him fifty, whilst he himself stuck  obstinately at thirty-five; of a stout active figure, rather manly than  gentlemanly, and a bold, jovial visage, in excellent keeping with his  person, distinguished by round, bright, stupid black eyes, an aquiline  nose, a knowing smile, and a general comely vulgarity of aspect. His  voice was hoarse and deep, his manner bluff and blunt, and his  conversation loud and boisterous. With all these natural impediments to  good company, the lowness of his origin, recent in their memories, and  the flagrant fact of his residence in a country town, staring them in  the face, Mr. Tom Hopkins made his way into almost every family of  consideration in the neighbourhood. Sportsmanship, sheer sportsmanship,  the qualification that, more than any other, commands the respect of  your great English landholder, surmounted every obstacle.    With the ladies, he made his way by different qualities; in the first  place he was a character, an oddity, and the audacity of his vulgarity  was tolerated, where a man only half as boisterous would have been  scouted; then he was gallant in his way, affected, perhaps felt, a great  devotion to the sex, and they were half amused, half pleased, with the  rough flattery which seemed, and probably was, so sincere.    His house was an ugly brick dwelling of his own erection, situate in the  principal street of Cranley, and adorned with a green door and a brass  knocker, giving entrance into a stone passage, which, there being no  other way to the stable, served both for himself, and that very dear  part of himself, his horses, whose dwelling was certainly by far more  commodious than their master's. His accommodations were simple enough.  The dining-parlour, which might pass for his only sitting-room,--for the  little dark den which he called his drawing-room was not entered three  times a year; the dining-room was a small square room, coloured  pea-green with a gold moulding, adorned with a series of four prints on  shooting, and four on hunting, together with two or three portraits of  eminent racers, riders, hunters, and grooms. Guns and fishing-rods were  suspended over the mantelpiece; powder-horns, shot-belts, and game-bags  scattered about; a choice collection of flies for angling lay in one  corner, whips and bridles in another, and a pile of books and  papers,--Colonel Thornton's Tour, Daniel's Rural Sports, and a heap of  Racing Calendars, occupied a third; Ponto and Carlo lay basking on the  hearth-rug, and a famous little cocking spaniel, Flora by name, a  conscious favourite, was generally stretched in state on an arm-chair.    Here, except when the owner was absent on a sporting expedition, which,  between fishing, shooting, hunting, and racing, did, it must be  confessed, happen pretty often; here his friends were sure to find a  hearty welcome, a good beef-steak,--his old housekeeper was famous for  cookery!--and as much excellent Port and super-excellent Madeira--Tom,  like most of his school, eschewed claret and other thin potations--as  their host could prevail on them to swallow. Many a good fellow hath  heard the chimes at midnight in this little room.           *       *       *       *       *    In the present sheet we are only able to include Notices of _four_ of  the _nine_ Annuals, exclusive of the _Juvenile Presents_, which we  reserve for a \"select party.\" Our notice of the _Winter's Wreath_ is in  type, but must stand over for the present, as well as those of the  _Keepsake, Anniversary, Bijou_, and _Friendship's Offering_, which will  freight another Supplementary Sheet, to follow very shortly. We prefer  this method to passing over the merits of these works with mere  commendatory generalities. It does not require a microscopic or a  critical eye to distinguish their beauties; but we hope the means we  have adopted for the present gratification of our readers will be such  as to induce them to look for the appearance of our SECOND SUPPLEMENT,  as well as to prove ourselves worthy of the _encore_. Like some comic  singers, we will endeavour to keep up the entertainment by \"variations.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Printed and Published by J. LIMBIRD, 143.

Volume 10, No. 284, (#8)"],[1,"details have raised a spirit of sympathetic forbearance towards the  distresses of men of letters, except in the breasts of the most barbarous  and vulgar. But their sufferings are doubly acute, and their perceptions  doubly tender. In their intercourse with mankind, they become _flattered_  by associates, and it not unfrequently happens that men who are the most  ready to quote such ascendancy or superiority in society, are the first  to break the charm they have created, by some act of extreme rigour. Such  conduct is cruel and unchristian.    Again, the sufferings of men of genius are increased by their own  reflection on them, and in addition to real woes they thus inflict on  themselves thousands of imaginary ones. A loss in trade may be repaired  by the profits of the succeeding day, and all be set right, where gain  is the sole idol; but when fame is mixed up in the pursuit, there is a  suffering beyond the hour, the day, or the year--mixed up in the defeat.  Hope is crushed; and after her flittering shade spring up misanthropy and  despair.    Light and fickle as is the public taste for literature, we are disposed  to think that, (barring the influence of great names) the chances of  success are as frequent in this as in any other field of human ingenuity;  and we can assure the public that our repose has not always been on a bed  of roses. But it seems to be with certain literary candidates as with  nations: there is a certain point of fame which men seem content to reach,  after which, in return for the darling caresses of the world, they kick at  their patrons; and if the maxim work true, that the fame of authors suffers  by our known contact and conversation with them, Sir Walter Scott's recent  avowal is a dangerous step, unless he was tired of his fame. Of course, we  have not yet arrived at the above point, so that our readers need not fear  our ingratitude; and we are willing to abide by the condition, that when we  forget our patrons, may they forget us.           *       *       *       *       *      CURE FOR ENVY.      Bishop Berkeley (that acute reasoner) contrived a lucky antidote, for the  suffering of envy. \"When I walk the streets,\" says he, \"I use the following  natural maxim, (viz. that he is the true possessor of a thing who enjoys  it, and not he that owns it without the enjoyment of it,) to convince  myself that I have a property in the gay part of all the gilt chariots  that I meet, which I regard as amusement to delight my eyes, and the  imagination of those kind people who sit in them gaily attired only to  please me;\" by which maxim he fancied himself one of the richest men in  Great Britain.           *       *       *       *       *    LIMBIRD'S EDITION OF THE BRITISH NOVELIST, Publishing in Monthly Parts,  price 6d. each.--Each Novel will be complete in itself, and may be  purchased separately.    _The following Novels are already Published:_                                                 s.  d.
