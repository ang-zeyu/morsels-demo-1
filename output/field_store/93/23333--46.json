It is shameful for philosophers thus to  contemplate the works of nature. For what is a master? Man is not the  master of man; but death is, and life and pleasure and pain; for if he  comes without these things, bring Caesar to me and you will see how firm  I am. But when he shall come with these things, thundering and  lightning, and when I am afraid of them, what do I do then except to  recognize my master like the runaway slave? But so long as I have any  respite from these terrors, as a runaway slave stands in the theatre, so  do I. I bathe, I drink, I sing; but all this I do with terror and  uneasiness. But if I shall release myself from my masters, that is from  those things by means of which masters are formidable, what further  trouble have I, what master have I still?    What then, ought we to publish these things to all men? No, but we ought  to accommodate ourselves to the ignorant ([Greek: tois idiotais]) and to  say: \"This man recommends to me that which he thinks good for himself. I  excuse him.\" For Socrates also excused the jailer who had the charge of  him in prison and was weeping when Socrates was going to drink the  poison, and said, \"How generously he laments over us.\" Does he then say  to the jailer that for this reason we have sent away the women? No, but  he says it to his friends who were able to hear (understand) it; and he  treats the jailer as a child.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT CONFIDENCE (COURAGE) IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH CAUTION.--The opinion  of the philosophers perhaps seem to some to be a paradox; but still let  us examine as well as we can, if it is true that it is possible to do  everything both with caution and with confidence. For caution seems to  be in a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries are in no way  consistent. That which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under  consideration in my opinion is of this kind; if we asserted that we  ought to employ caution and confidence in the same things, men might  justly accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be united. But  now where is the difficulty in what is said? for if these things are  true, which have been often said and often proved, that the nature of  good is in the use of appearances, and the nature of evil likewise, and  that things independent of our will do not admit either the nature of  evil or of good, what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say  that where things are not dependent on the will, there you should employ  confidence, but where they are dependent on the will, there you should  employ caution? For if the bad consists in the bad exercise of the will,  caution ought only to be used where things are dependent on the will.  But if things independent of the will and not in our power are nothing  to us, with respect to these we must employ confidence; and thus we  shall both be cautious and confident, and indeed confident because of  our caution. For by employing caution towards things which are really  bad, it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to things  which are not so.    We are then in the condition of deer; when they flee from the huntsmen's  feathers in fright, whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge  as safe? They turn to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding  things which are objects of fear with things that they ought not to  fear. Thus we also act: in what cases do we fear? In things which are  independent of the will. In what cases on the contrary do we behave with  confidence, as if there were no danger? In things dependent on the will.  To be deceived then, or to act rashly, or shamelessly, or with base  desire to seek something, does not concern us at all, if we only hit the  mark in things which are independent of our will. But where there is  death or exile or pain or infamy, there we attempt to run away, there we  are struck with terror. Therefore, as we may expect it to happen with  those who err in the greatest matters, we convert natural confidence  (that is, according to nature) into audacity, desperation, rashness,  shamelessness; and we convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice  and meanness, which are full of fear and confusion. For if a man should  transfer caution to those things in which the will may be exercised and  the acts of the will, he will immediately by willing to be cautious have  also the power of avoiding what he chooses; but if he transfer it to the  things which are not in his power and will, and attempt to avoid the  things which are in the power of others, he will of necessity fear, he  will be unstable, he will be disturbed; for death or pain is not  formidable, but the fear of pain or death. For this reason we commend  the poet, who said:      \"Not death is evil, but a shameful death.\"    Confidence (courage) then ought to be employed against death, and  caution against the fear of death. But now we do the contrary, and  employ against death the attempt to escape; and to our opinion about it  we employ carelessness, rashness, and indifference. These things  Socrates properly used to call tragic masks; for as to children masks  appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we also are affected in  like manner by events (the things which happen in life) for no other  reason than children are by masks. For what is a child? Ignorance. What  is a child? Want of knowledge. For when a child knows these things, he  is in no way inferior to us. What is death? A tragic mask. Turn it and  examine it. See, it does not bite. The poor body must be separated from  the spirit either now or later as it was separated from it before. Why  then are you troubled if it be separated now? for if it is not separated  now, it will be separated afterwards. Why? That the period of the  universe may be completed, for it has need of the present, and of the  future, and of the past. What is pain? A mask. Turn it and examine it.  The poor flesh is moved roughly, then on the contrary smoothly. If this  does not satisfy (please) you, the door is open; if it does, bear (with  things). For the door ought to be open for all occasions; and so we have  no trouble.    What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that which ought to be  the most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated,  release from perturbation, release from fear. Freedom. For in these  matters we must not believe the many, who say that free persons only  ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who  say that the educated only are free. How is this? In this manner: Is  freedom anything else than the power of living as we choose? Nothing  else. Tell me then, ye men, do you wish to live in error? We do not. No  one then who lives in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear? Do you  wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live in perturbation? By no  means. No one then who is in a state of fear or sorrow or perturbation  is free; but whoever is delivered from sorrows and fears and  perturbations, he is at the same time also delivered from servitude. How  then can we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, when you  say, We only allow free persons to be educated? For philosophers say we  allow none to be free except the educated; that is, God does not allow  it. When then a man has turned round before the praetor his own slave,  has he done nothing? He has done something. What? He has turned round  his own slave before the praetor. Has he done nothing more? Yes: he is  also bound to pay for him the tax called the twentieth. Well then, is  not the man who has gone through this ceremony become free? No more than  he is become free from perturbations. Have you who are able to turn  round (free) others no master? is not money your master, or a girl or a  boy, or some tyrant or some friend of the tyrant? Why do you trouble  then when you are going off to any trial (danger) of this kind? It is  for this reason that I often say, study and hold in readiness these  principles by which you may determine what those things are with  reference to which you ought to be cautious, courageous in that which  does not depend on your will, cautious in that which does depend on it.           *       *       *       *       *    OF TRANQUILLITY (FREEDOM FROM PERTURBATION).--Consider, you who are  going into court, what you wish to maintain and what you wish to succeed  in. For if you wish to maintain a will conformable to nature, you have  every security, every facility, you have no troubles. For if you wish to  maintain what is in your own power and is naturally free, and if you are  content with these, what else do you care for? For who is the master of  such things? Who can take them away? If you choose to be modest and  faithful, who shall not allow you to be so? If you choose not to be  restrained or compelled, who shall compel you to desire what you think  that you ought not to desire? who shall compel you to avoid what you do  not think fit to avoid? But what do you say? The judge will determine  against you something that appears formidable; but that you should also  suffer in trying to avoid it, how can he do that? When then the pursuit  of objects and the avoiding of them are in your power, what else do you  care for? Let this be your preface, this your narrative, this your  confirmation, this your victory, this your peroration, this your  applause (or the approbation which you will receive).    Therefore Socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare for his  trial, Do you not think then that I have been preparing for it all my  life? By what kind of preparation? I have maintained that which was in  my own power. How then? I have never done anything unjust either in my  private or in my public life.

And this story I heard everywhere in my travels through the cities of  the Great Redoubt, which travels began when I came upon my seventeenth  year, and continued for three years and two hundred and twenty five  days, being even then but one day in each city, as was the custom in the  training of every child.    And truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to  know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not  space enough; and each must to his duty to the security and well-being  of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much,  always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.    And, as I have said, everywhere I went there was the same story of this  other Place of Refuge; and in such of the Libraries of those cities as I  had time to search, there were great numbers of works upon the existence  of this other Refuge; and some, far back in the years, made assertion  with confidence that such a Place was in verity; and, indeed, no doubt  did there seem in those by-gone ages; but now these very Records were  read only by Scholars, who doubted, even whilst they read. And so is it  ever.    But of the reality of this Refuge, I had never a sound doubt, from the  day of my hearing concerning it from our Master Monstruwacan, who with  all his assistants occupied the Tower of Observation in the apex of the  Pyramid. And here let me tell that he and I had always an affinity and  close friendship one for the other; though he was full grown, and I but  a youth; yet so it was; and thus, when I had come to an age of  twenty-one years of life, he opened to me a post within the Tower of  Observation; and this was a most wondrous good fortune to me; for in all  the vast Redoubt, to be appointed to the Tower of Observation was the  most desired; for thereby, even as in these days doth Astronomy, was the  natural curiosity of Man eased somewhat, even while thwarted.    Now, let me tell here also, lest it be thought that I was unduly  favoured because of my friendship with the Master Monstruwacan, that  there was a sound justification for his choice, in that to me had been  given that strange gift of hearing, which we called Night-Hearing;  though this was but a fanciful name, and meant little. Yet the peculiar  gift was rare, and in all the millions of the Pyramid, there was none  with the gift to a great degree, saving only myself.    And I, because of this gift, could hear the \"invisible vibrations\" of  the aether; so that, without harking to the calling of our recording  instruments, I could take the messages which came continually through  the eternal darkness; aye, even better than they. And now, it may be the  better understood, how much was to be counted that I had grown to listen  for a voice that had not rung in mine ears for an eternity, and yet  which sang sweet and clear in my memory-dreams; so that it seemed to me  that Mirdath the Beautiful slept within my soul, and whispered to me out  of all the ages.    And then, one day, at the fifteenth hour, when began the Sleep-Time, I  had been pondering this love of mine that lived with me still; and  marvelling that my memory-dreams held the voice of a love that _had  been_ in so remote an age. And pondering and dreaming thus, as a young  man may, I could fancy this aeon-lost One were whispering beauty into  my ears, in verity; so clear had my memory grown, and so much had I  pondered.    And lo! as I stood there, harking and communing with my thoughts, I  thrilled suddenly, as if I had been smitten; for out of all the  everlasting night a whisper was thrilling and thrilling upon my more  subtile hearing.    Through four long years had I listened, since that awakening in the  embrasure, when but a youth of seventeen; and now out of the  world-darkness and all the eternal years of that lost life, which now I  live in this Present Age of ours, was the whisper come; for I knew it  upon that instant; and yet, because I was so taught to wisdom, I  answered by no name; but sent the Master-Word through the night--sending  it with my brain-elements, as I could, and as all may, much or little,  as may be, if they be not clods. And, moreover, I knew that she who  called quietly would have the power to hear without instruments, if  indeed it were she; and if it were but one of the false callings of the  Evil Forces, or more cunning monsters, or as was sometimes thought  concerning these callings, the House of Silence, meddling with our  souls, then would they have no power to say the Master-Word; for this  had been proven through all the Everlasting.    And lo! as I stood, trembling and striving not to be tense, which  destroys the receptivity, there came thrilling round and round my  spiritual essence the throb of the Master-Word, beating steadily in the  night, as doth that marvellous sound. And then, with all that was sweet  in my spirit, I called with my brain elements: \"Mirdath! Mirdath!  Mirdath!\" And at that instant the Master Monstruwacan entered that part  of the Tower of Observation, where I stood; and, seeing my face, stood  very quiet; for though he had not the power of Night-Hearing, he was  wise and thoughtful, and took much account of my gift; more-over, he had  but come from the Receiving Instrument, and thought vaguely to have  caught the throb of the Master-Word, though too faint to come proper  through the Instrument, so that he searched for me, in that I, who had  the Hearing, might listen for it, I being, as I have said, gifted in  that wise.    And to him I told something of my story and my thoughts and my memories,  and of that awakening; and thus up to this present happening, and he  hearkened with sympathy and a troubled and wondering heart; for in that  age a man might talk sanely upon that which, in this age of ours would  be accounted foolishness and maybe the breathings of insanity; for  there, by the refinement of arts of mentality and the results of strange  experiments and the accomplishment of learning, men were abled to  conceive of matters now closed to our conceptions, even as we of this  day may haply give a calm ear to talk, that in the days of our fathers  would have been surely set to the count of lunacy. And this is very  clear.    And all the while that I told my story, I listened with my spirit; but  save for a sense of faint, happy laughter that wrapped about me, I heard  naught. And nothing more all that day.    Here let me put down that, because of my memories and half memories, I  would time and again dispute with our learned men; they being in doubt  as to the verity of that olden story of the Days of Light, and the  existence of the Sun; though something of all this was set out, as of  _truth_, in our oldest records; but I, remembering, told them many tales  that seemed fairy-like to them, and entranced their hearts, even whilst  I angered their brains, which refused to take seriously and as verity  that which their hearts accepted gladly, even as we receive the wonder  of poetry into our souls. But the Master Monstruwacan would listen to  aught I had to tell; aye! though I spoke through hours; and so it would  be, odd times, that having talked long, drawing my stories from my  Memory-Dreams, I would come back again into the present of that Future;  and lo! all the Monstruwacans would have left their instruments and  observations and recording, and be gathered about me; and the Master so  sunken in interest that he not to have discovered them; neither had I  noticed, being so full of the things which had been.    But when the Master came back to knowledge of that present, he would  rouse and chide, and they, all those lesser ones, would fly swiftly and  guiltily to their various works; and yet, so I have thought since, each  with a muddled and bewildered and thoughtful air upon him; and hungry  they were for more, and ever wondering and setting questions about.    And so it was also with those others--those learned ones who were not of  the Tower of Observation, and who disbelieved even whilst they hungered.  Listen would they, though I talked from the first hour, which was the  \"dawn,\" to the fifteenth hour, which was the beginning of the \"night\";  for the Sleep-Time was set thus, after other usage and experiment. And,  odd whiles, I found that there were among them, men of extraordinary  learning who upheld my tellings as tales of verity; and so there was a  faction; but, later, there grew more to believe; and whether they  believed, or not, all were ready to listen; so that I might have spended  my days in talk; only that I had my work to do.    But the Master Monstruwacan believed from the beginning, and was wise  always to understand; so that I loved him for this, as for many another  dear quality.    And so, as may be conceived, among all those millions I was singled out  to be known; for the stories that I told went downward through a  thousand cities; and, presently, in the lowest tier of the Underground  Fields, an hundred miles deep in the earth below the Redoubt, I found  that the very ploughboys knew something concerning my tellings; and  gathered about me one time and another when the Master Monstruwacan and  I had gone down, regarding some matter that dealt with the Earth-Current  and our Instruments.    And of the Underground Fields (though in that age we called them no more  than \"The Fields\") I should set down a little; for they were the  mightiest work of this world; so that even the Last Redoubt was but a  small thing beside them. An hundred miles deep lay the lowest of the  Underground Fields, and was an hundred miles from side to side, every  way; and above it there were three hundred and six fields, each one less  in area than that beneath; and in this wise they tapered, until the  topmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the Great  Redoubt, was but four miles every way.    And thus it"]]]
