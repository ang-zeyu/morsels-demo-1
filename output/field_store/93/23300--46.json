She bound the gods her children with [evil bonds].    3. Tiamat wrought wickedness to avenge Apsu.    4. When ... had harnessed his chariot he went to meet Ea,    5. Ea hearkened to his story,    6. He was sorely afflicted and abode in sorrow,    7. The days were long, his wrath died down.    8. He went his way to the dwelling of Anshar, his father,    9. He went into the presence of Anshar, the father who begat him,    [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text  of the Second Tablet of the Creation Series. [No. 40,559.]]    10. Whatsoever Tiamat had devised he repeated unto him,    11. Mother Tiamat who gave us birth hath sown these things.    12. She hath set in order her assembly, she rageth furiously,    13. All the gods have joined themselves to her.    14. They march by her side together with those whom ye have created.    15. They formed a band and went forth to battle to help Tiamat,    16. They were exceedingly wroth, they made plots by day and by night  without ceasing,    17. They offered battle, fuming and raging,    18. They set the battle in array, they uttered cries of defiance.    19. Ummu-Khubur,[1] who fashioned all things,    [Footnote 1: See above.]    20. Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents    21. Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)    22. She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood,    23. Grim, monstrous serpents arrayed in terror.    24. She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted  forms,    25. So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon  them,    26. So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their  attack.    27. She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,    28. The Whirlwind, the ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,    29. The Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the Horned Beast.    30. They carried the Weapon which spared not, nor flinched from the  battle.    31. Most mighty were Tiamat's allies, they could not be resisted.    32. Thus she caused eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into being.    33. Among the gods, her first-born son who had collected her company,    34. That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great one  amongst them.    35. Leader of the hosts in battle, disposer of the troops,    36. Bearer of the firmly-grasped weapon, attacker in the fight,    37. He who in the battle is the master of the weapon,    38. She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel]    39. [Saying], \"I have recited the incantation for thee, I have  magnified thee in the assembly of the gods,    40. \"I have filled his [_sic_, read 'thy'] hand with the  sovereignty of the whole company of the gods.    41. \"Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse,    42. \"May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them.\"    43. She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his  breast, [saying]--    44. \"As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, what goeth forth  from thy mouth shall be established.\"    45. When Kingu was raised on high and had taken the heavens  (literally, \"the god Anutum\")    46. He fixed the destinies for the gods his sons, [saying],    47. \"Open your mouths, let the Fire-god be quenched,    48. \"He who is glorious in battle and is most mighty shall do great  deeds.\"    49. When Anshar heard that Tiamat was stirred mightily,    50. ... he bit his lips    51. ... his mind was not at peace    [Lines 52-54 too fragmentary for translation.]    An'shar then addresses Ea and says:--    55. \"Thou hast slain Mummu and Apsu    56. \"But Tiamat hath exalted Kingu--where is the one who can meet her?    [Lines 57 and 58 imperfect; lines 59-71 wanting.]    72. Anshar spake a word unto his son [Anu]:--    73. \"... this is a difficulty, my warrior    74. \"Whose power is exalted, whose attack cannot be stayed,    75. \"Go and stand thou in the presence of Tiamat,    76. \"That her spirit [be quieted], her heart softened.    77. \"But should she not hearken unto thy word,    78. \"Speak thou our word unto her so that she may be abated.\"    79. [Anu] heard the order of his father Anshar.    80. He took the straight road to her, and hastened on the way to her.    81. Anu drew nigh, he searched out the plan of Tiamat,    82. He could not prevail against her, he turned back.    Lines 83 and 84 contain Anu's report to Anshar, but they are too  fragmentary to translate; line 85 reads:--    83. He (Anu) went to his father Anshar who begat him,    84. He spake unto him a word [concerning Tiamat]    85. [She laid] hands upon me that withered me up.\"    86. Anshar was distressed, he looked down upon the ground,    87. He turned pale; towards Ea he lifted up his head.    88. All the Anunnaki assembled at their posts.    89. They shut their mouths, they sat in lamentation.    90. [They said], \"Nowhere is there a god who can attack Tiamat.    91. \"He would not escape from Tiamat's presence with his life.\"    92. The Lord Anshar, the Father of the gods, [spake] majestically,    93. He lifted up his heart, he addressed the Anunnaki, [saying]    94. \"He whose [strength] is mighty [shall be] an avenger for [us]    95. \"The ... in the strife, Marduk the Hero.\"    96. Ea called Marduk to the place where he gave oracles,    97. Marduk came and according to his heart he addressed him,    98. [Saying], \"O Marduk, hear the counsel and advice of thy father,    99. \"Thou art the son who refresheth his heart,    100. \"Draw nigh and enter the presence of An-shar,    101. \"Stand there [with joy], when he looketh upon thee he will be at  rest.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Lines 83, 84, 88-101 are translated from the British  Museum fragments and the Berlin fragments; lines 88-101 contain the  equivalent to the whole gap in the British Museum tablet.]    113. The Lord [Marduk] rejoiced at the word of his father,    114. He approached and took up his place before Anshar.    115. Anshar looked upon him and his heart was filled with gladness.    116. He (i.e., Anshar) kissed his (Marduk's) lips, and his  (Anshar's) fear was removed. [Then Marduk said]    117. \"My father, let not the opening of thy mouth be closed,[1]    [Footnote 1: i.e., \"let what thou sayest prevail.\"]    118. \"I will go, I will make to take place all that is in thy heart.    119. \"Anshar, let not the opening of thy mouth be closed,    120. \"I will go, I will make to take place all that is in thy heart.\"  [Anshar says to Marduk]    121. \"What man is the cause of the battle which made thee go forth    122. \"... Tiamat, who is a woman, pursueth thee with weapons.    123. \"Rejoice our [hearts] and make us glad.    124. \"Thou thyself shalt soon trample upon the neck of Tiamat,    125. \"Rejoice our [hearts] and make us glad.    126. \"Thou thyself shalt soon trample upon the neck of Tiamat.    127. \"My son, who dost comprehend everything,    128. \"Cast deep sleep upon Tiamat with thy holy spell.    129. \"Betake thyself to thy march with all speed.    130. \"...\"    131. The Lord [Marduk] rejoiced at the word of his father,    132. His heart leaped with joy, to his father he spake, [saying],    133. \"O Lord of the gods, Overlord of the Great Gods,    134. \"Should I as your avenger    135. \"Slay Tiamat and bestow life upon you,    136. \"Summon a meeting, proclaim and magnify my position,    137. \"Sit ye down together in friendly fashion in Upshukkinaku.    138. \"Let me issue decrees by the opening of my mouth even as ye do.    139. \"Whatsoever I bring to pass let it remain unaltered,    140. \"That which my mouth uttereth shall never fail or be brought to  nought.\"        THIRD TABLET.    1. Anshar opened his mouth, and    2. Unto the god Gaga, his envoy, spake a word [saying],    3. \"O Gaga, my envoy, who makest glad my liver.    4. \"I will despatch thee unto the gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu.    [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text  of the Third Tablet of the Creation Series.

Volume 10, No. 267, August (#7)"],[1,"bears down in a magnificent mass,  shouldering its way, as it seemed, half across it. The opposite sides  appear more bare, precipitous, and lofty; and this last character is  heightened by some white clouds that rest upon and conceal  their summits.    Rejoining the road, we for awhile lost sight of the valley. When we  again came in view of it, it was rapidly filling with clouds, but at  first their interposition was hardly a disadvantage; they gave a vague  indefinite grandeur to the cliffs and mountains, which seemed to rise  one knew not from what depth, and lose their summits in regions beyond  our ken. The breaks, too, that occurred in this shrouding of the scene,  showed fragments of it with strange effect--till at length the whole  hollow filled, and presented a uniform sea of vapour.    _Rambles in Madeira_.           *       *       *       *       *      A PORTUGUESE BALL.      The ladies are carried in palanquins, and each received at the street  entrance by the master of the house--or if there be more than one lady,  by some gentlemen deputed for that purpose--who takes her hand, and so  ushers her up stairs. There is much of this elaborate gallantry  observable in the manner of the Portuguese towards the sex. Thus, a man  never passes a lady in the street, or in her balcony, without taking off  his hat, and this whether he be acquainted with her or not. We  understand they used to offer a similar mark of respect to the English  ladies, but desisted on finding that our gentlemen did not reciprocate  in the same homage towards the fair _Portuguezas_. I don't think that  this difference in the manners of the two people does us credit. Not  that all that kind of homage means much. In this, as in a more serious  concern, our southern neighbours may seem to have the advantage in the  practices of external devotion; but it would be a mistake to infer from  thence, that there is with us less of that service of the heart, which,  after all, is the one thing needful. The party was large, probably two  hundred, including most of the native rank and fashion of the island. We  found the ladies all seated together in one room, and the effect of this  concentration was sufficiently dazzling. Some people deny that there is  any standard of female beauty; and, at any rate, there is no doubt but  that habits and associations, as well as complexional and sentimental  considerations, interfere more with our perceptions in respect to this  than any other object of taste. It is not immediately that we enter into  the merits of a style of beauty very different from that which we have  been accustomed to. Perhaps it is owing to this circumstance that I was  not struck by so many instances of individual attractiveness as might  have been expected in so crowded a galaxy. The traits that first strike  a stranger in a Portuguese belle, are the tendency to _embonpoint_ in  the figure, and to darkness--I had almost said swarthiness, in  complexion. This last character, however, is not particularly obvious by  candle-light; and it is always relieved by the most raven hair, and eyes  such as one seldom sees elsewhere, so large and black; if their fire  were softened by a longer lash, and their expression less fixed, there  would be no resisting them. I fancy, too, that their effect would be  rather greater in a _tete-a-tete_ than in a circle like this, where,  looking round, one sees on all sides the same eyes--and which all (it is  everywhere the reproach of black eyes) say always the same thing. Their  dress was perfectly in the English fashion; and, in general, there was  something not un-English in their _mise_ and _tournure_. The superiority  of French women in these matters is incontestable. Perhaps we may  account for it something on the principle by which Dr. Johnson explained  the excellence of our neighbours in cookery, when he suspected that the  inferiority of their meats rendered indispensable some extraordinary  skill in dressing it. The general arrangement and progress of the  evening was very English too. They dance remarkably well, the men as  well as the women. Indeed, it is, I believe, the great end and  occupation of the earlier part of their existence. We came away at two  o'clock; few of the English staid later; but among the Portuguese, the  more ardent spirits kept up the dance till long after day-break, when it  is customary to serve up _caldo_, a sort of chicken-broth, for their  refreshment.--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *        MISCELLANIES.           *       *       *       *       *      QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.      _What is a Lawyer?_--A lawyer is a man with a pale face and sunken eyes;  he passes much time in two small rooms in one of the inns of court; he  is surrounded with sheets of foolscap folio paper, tied up with a red  string; he has more books than one could read in a year, or comprehend  in seven; he walks slowly, speaks hesitatingly, and receives fees from  those who visit him, for giving \"hypothetical answers\" to \"specious  questions.\"    _What is a Doctor?_--A doctor, _videlicit_ an M.D., is a sedate-looking  personage; he listens calmly to the story of your ailments; if your eye  and skin be yellow, he shrewdly remarks that you have the jaundice; he  feels your pulse, writes two or three unintelligible lines of Latin, for  which you pay him a guinea; he keeps a chariot, and one man-servant. The  standard board behind, _intended_ for a footman, is fearfully beset with  spikes, to prevent little boys from riding at the doctor's expense. He  ingeniously lets himself in and out of his vehicle, by means of a strap  attached to the steps, so contrived, that when in, he can dexterously  cause the steps to follow. His servant is a coachman abroad, and a  footman, valet, and butler at home.    _What is an Author?_--He is a man who weaves words into sentences; he  dissects the works of his predecessors and contemporaries, and  ingeniously dovetails the pieces together again, so that their real  owners can scarcely recognise them. He is furnished with a pair of  scissors and a pot of paste. He frequents the Chapter Coffee-house by  day, and the Cider-Cellar by night. He ruralises at Hampstead or  Holloway, and perhaps once a year steams it to Margate. He talks  largely, and forms the nucleus of a knot of acquaintances, who look up  to him as an oracle. He is always _going_ to set about some work of  great importance; he writes a page, becomes out of humour with the  subject, and begins another, which shares the same fate. His coat is  something the worse for wear; his wife is the only person in the world  who is blind to his transcendant abilities; and he has too much to do in  cultivating his own genius, to descend to the minutias of his children's  education.      SUPERSTITION.      In a little manual of piety, composed, in 1712, for the young ladies who  were then pensioners at the monastery of St. Augustin, at Bruges, we  have been surprised into frequent smiles by the scrupulous watchfulness  with which the ghostly writer followed the lady-pensioners (though with  pious fancy only) to the very sacred of sacreds! He was not contented  with directing them concerning the prayers which he believed proper to  be used when they assumed, or laid aside, their respective garments, but  even directed them what to do before they attempted to close an eye on  the softness of their pillows! Prayers are specified by this zealous  pastor for the following curious occasions:--        In putting on your petticoat.      In putting on your night-gown.      In dressing your head.      In putting on your manteau.    In regard to the ceremony of laying aside these memorials of the  weakness of Eve, our general mother, there is a prayer to be offered  \"whilst you undress yourself;\" and the ladies are strictly enjoined,  before they \"get into bed, to take holy water.\" The writer concludes  this part of his instructions by saying, \"when you are in bed, write the  name of Jesus on your forehead with your thumb!\"      CROMWELL.      After the battle of Marston, Cromwell, returning from the pursuit of a  party of the royalists, purposed to stop at Ripley; and, having an  officer in his troop, a relation of Sir William Ingilby's, that  gentleman was sent to announce his arrival. The officer was informed, by  the porter at the gate, that Sir William was absent, but that he might  send any message he pleased to his lady. Having sent in his name, and  obtained an audience, he was answered by the lady, that no such person  should be admitted there; adding, she had force sufficient to defend  herself and that house against all rebels. The officer, on his part,  represented the extreme folly of making any resistance, and that the  safest way would be to admit the general peaceably. After much  persuasion, the lady took the advice of her kinsman, and received  Cromwell at the gate of the lodge, with a pair of pistols stuck in her  apron-strings, and having told him she expected that neither he nor his  soldiers would behave improperly, led the way to the hall, where,  sitting each on a sofa, these two extraordinary personages, equally  jealous of each other's intentions, passed the whole night. At his  departure in the morning the lady observed, \"It was well he had behaved  in so peaceable a manner; for that, had it been otherwise, he would not  have left that house with his life.\"      HOWARD.      Of this celebrated man no portrait was ever painted, for he would never  sit to any artist. After his return from one of his journies to the  continent, he was showing to a friend the various things he had brought  with him, and among others a new dress made in Saxony: \"it was a sort of  great coat, yet graceful in its appearance, and ornamented with sober  magnificence. His visiter exclaimed, 'This is the robe in which you  should be painted by Romney; I will implore the favour on my knees if  you"]]]
