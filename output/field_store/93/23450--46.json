It was like swimming slowly at random in an ocean that was  smooth, and neither too cool nor too warm. And before I knew it, five  lazy imperceptible hours had gone thus. There was the Union Pacific  train, coming as if from shores forgotten.    Its approach was silent and long drawn out. I easily reached town and  the platform before it had finished watering at the tank. It moved up,  made a short halt, I saw my trunk come out of it, and then it moved away  silently as it had come, smoking and dwindling into distance unknown.    Beside my trunk was one other, tied extravagantly with white ribbon. The  fluttering bows caught my attention, and now I suddenly saw a perfectly  new sight. The Virginian was further down the platform, doubled up with  laughing. It was good to know that with sufficient cause he could laugh  like this; a smile had thus far been his limit of external mirth.  Rice now flew against my hat, and hissing gusts of rice spouted on the  platform. All the men left in Medicine Bow appeared like magic, and more  rice choked the atmosphere. Through the general clamor a cracked voice  said, \"Don't hit her in the eye, boys!\" and Uncle Hughey rushed proudly  by me with an actual wife on his arm. She could easily have been his  granddaughter. They got at once into a vehicle. The trunk was lifted in  behind. And amid cheers, rice, shoes, and broad felicitations, the pair  drove out of town, Uncle Hughey shrieking to the horses and the bride  waving unabashed adieus.    The word had come over the wires from Laramie: \"Uncle Hughey has made  it this time. Expect him on to-day's number two.\" And Medicine Bow had  expected him.    Many words arose on the departure of the new-married couple.    \"Who's she?\"    \"What's he got for her?\"    \"Got a gold mine up Bear Creek.\"    And after comment and prophecy, Medicine Bow returned to its dinner.    This meal was my last here for a long while. The Virginian's  responsibility now returned; duty drove the Judge's trustworthy man  to take care of me again. He had not once sought my society of his own  accord; his distaste for what he supposed me to be (I don't exactly know  what this was) remained unshaken. I have thought that matters of dress  and speech should not carry with them so much mistrust in our democracy;  thieves are presumed innocent until proved guilty, but a starched collar  is condemned at once. Perfect civility and obligingness I certainly did  receive from the Virginian, only not a word of fellowship. He harnessed  the horses, got my trunk, and gave me some advice about taking  provisions for our journey, something more palatable than what food we  should find along the road. It was well thought of, and I bought quite a  parcel of dainties, feeling that he would despise both them and me. And  thus I took my seat beside him, wondering what we should manage to talk  about for two hundred and sixty-three miles.    Farewell in those days was not said in Cattle Land. Acquaintances  watched our departure with a nod or with nothing, and the nearest  approach to \"Good-by\" was the proprietor's \"So-long.\" But I caught sight  of one farewell given without words.    As we drove by the eating-house, the shade of a side window was raised,  and the landlady looked her last upon the Virginian. Her lips were  faintly parted, and no woman's eyes ever said more plainly, \"I am one of  your possessions.\" She had forgotten that it might be seen. Her glance  caught mine, and she backed into the dimness of the room. What look  she may have received from him, if he gave her any at this too public  moment, I could not tell. His eyes seemed to be upon the horses, and  he drove with the same mastering ease that had roped the wild pony  yesterday. We passed the ramparts of Medicine Bow,--thick heaps and  fringes of tin cans, and shelving mounds of bottles cast out of the  saloons. The sun struck these at a hundred glittering points. And in a  moment we were in the clean plains, with the prairie-dogs and the pale  herds of antelope. The great, still air bathed us, pure as water and  strong as wine; the sunlight flooded the world; and shining upon the  breast of the Virginian's flannel shirt lay a long gold thread of hair!  The noisy American drummer had met defeat, but this silent free lance  had been easily victorious.    It must have been five miles that we travelled in silence, losing and  seeing the horizon among the ceaseless waves of the earth. Then I looked  back, and there was Medicine Bow, seemingly a stone's throw behind  us. It was a full half-hour before I looked back again, and there sure  enough was always Medicine Bow. A size or two smaller, I will admit, but  visible in every feature, like something seen through the wrong end of  a field glass. The East-bound express was approaching the town, and I  noticed the white steam from its whistle; but when the sound reached us,  the train had almost stopped. And in reply to my comment upon this, the  Virginian deigned to remark that it was more so in Arizona.    \"A man come to Arizona,\" he said, \"with one of them telescopes to study  the heavenly bodies. He was a Yankee, seh, and a right smart one, too.  And one night we was watchin' for some little old fallin' stars that he  said was due, and I saw some lights movin' along across the mesa pretty  lively, an' I sang out. But he told me it was just the train. And I told  him I didn't know yu' could see the cyars that plain from his place,  'Yu' can see them,' he said to me, 'but it is las' night's cyars you're  lookin' at.'\" At this point the Virginian spoke severely to one of the  horses. \"Of course,\" he then resumed to me, \"that Yankee man did not  mean quite all he said.--You, Buck!\" he again broke off suddenly to  the horse. \"But Arizona, seh,\" he continued, \"it cert'nly has a mos'  deceivin' atmospheah. Another man told me he had seen a lady close one  eye at him when he was two minutes hard run from her.\" This time the  Virginian gave Buck the whip.    \"What effect,\" I inquired with a gravity equal to his own, \"does this  extraordinary foreshortening have upon a quart of whiskey?\"    \"When it's outside yu', seh, no distance looks too far to go to it.\"    He glanced at me with an eye that held more confidence than hitherto he  had been able to feel in me. I had made one step in his approval. But  I had many yet to go. This day he preferred his own thoughts to my  conversation, and so he did all the days of this first journey; while  I should have greatly preferred his conversation to my thoughts. He  dismissed some attempts that I made upon the subject of Uncle Hughey so  that I had not the courage to touch upon Trampas, and that chill brief  collision which might have struck the spark of death. Trampas! I had  forgotten him till this silent drive I was beginning. I wondered if I  should ever see him, or Steve, or any of those people again. And this  wonder I expressed aloud.    \"There's no tellin' in this country,\" said the Virginian. \"Folks come  easy, and they go easy. In settled places, like back in the States, even  a poor man mostly has a home. Don't care if it's only a barrel on a lot,  the fello' will keep frequentin' that lot, and if yu' want him yu' can  find him. But out hyeh in the sage-brush, a man's home is apt to be his  saddle blanket. First thing yu' know, he has moved it to Texas.\"    \"You have done some moving yourself,\" I suggested.    But this word closed his mouth. \"I have had a look at the country,\" he  said, and we were silent again. Let me, however, tell you here that he  had set out for a \"look at the country\" at the age of fourteen; and  that by his present age of twenty-four he had seen Arkansas, Texas,  New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  Everywhere he had taken care of himself, and survived; nor had his  strong heart yet waked up to any hunger for a home. Let me also tell you  that he was one of thousands drifting and living thus, but (as you shall  learn) one in a thousand.    Medicine Bow did not forever remain in sight. When next I thought of it  and looked behind, nothing was there but the road we had come; it lay  like a ship's wake across the huge ground swell of the earth. We were  swallowed in a vast solitude. A little while before sunset, a cabin came  in view; and here we passed our first night. Two young men lived here,  tending their cattle. They were fond of animals. By the stable a chained  coyote rushed nervously in a circle, or sat on its haunches and snapped  at gifts of food ungraciously. A tame young elk walked in and out of  the cabin door, and during supper it tried to push me off my chair. A  half-tame mountain sheep practised jumping from the ground to the roof.  The cabin was papered with posters of a circus, and skins of bear and  silver fox lay upon the floor. Until nine o'clock one man talked to the  Virginian, and one played gayly upon a concertina; and then we all went  to bed. The air was like December, but in my blankets and a buffalo robe  I kept warm, and luxuriated in the Rocky Mountain silence. Going to wash  before breakfast at sunrise, I found needles of ice in a pail. Yet it  was hard to remember that this quiet, open, splendid wilderness (with  not a peak in sight just here) was six thousand feet high. And when  breakfast was over there was no December left; and by the time the  Virginian and I were ten miles upon our way, it was June. But always  every breath that I breathed was pure as water and strong as wine.    We never passed a human being this day. Some wild cattle rushed up to  us and away from us; antelope stared at us from a hundred yards; coyotes  ran skulking through the sage-brush to watch us from a hill; at our noon  meal we killed a rattlesnake and shot some young sage chickens, which  were good at supper, roasted at our camp-fire.    By half-past eight we were asleep beneath the stars, and by half-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#8)"],[1,"supplies for horses. Irish potatoes  grow to a great size, and all edible roots cultivated in the States  are produced in perfection, without irrigation.    The climate of San Francisco is unquestionably disagreeable; the  cold, fierce winds which sweep over the bay, and they alternating with  extreme heats, are prejudicial to health and comfort. Inland, however,  in the beautiful valleys of San Jose and Los Angelos, the climate is  all that can be desired. The heat during the summer months is indeed  great, but its dryness renders it more endurable than the damp  sultriness of an Atlantic August. At Los Angelos, latitude 34 deg. 7',  long. W. 118 deg., and forty miles from the ocean, the mean monthly  temperature of ten months was as follows: June 73 deg., July 74,  August 75, September 75, October 69, November 59, December 60.    Our author describes with a poet's enthusiasm the atmospheric effects  of the Californian sunsets. Fresh from his travels in Italy, and with  the dust of that Pincian hill still on his sandals from whence Claude  sketched his sunsets, he declares that his memory of that classic  atmosphere seems cold and pale, when he thinks of the splendor of  evening on the bay and mountains of San Francisco.    The chapter on \"Society in California\" may prove of much practical  utility, and should be read by all who are smitten with the  gold fever. California is no place for the sick, the weak, the  self-indulgent, the indolent, the desponding. There must be a  willingness to work at anything and everything, and stout muscles to  execute the will. Our author estimates that nearly one-third of the  emigrants are unfitted for their vocation, \"miserable, melancholy  men, ready to yield up their last breath at any moment, who left home  prematurely, and now humbly acknowledge their error.\" His own happy  constitution and buoyant health led him to look on the best side of  things, and to take the sunniest possible view of the condition of the  new country he was exploring, but occasionally he reveals incidentally  the reverse of the picture. Here is a sketch of a sick miner at  Sacramento City, which is enough to make even California \"gold become  dim, and the fine gold changed.\"        \"He was sitting alone on a stone beside the water, with his      bare feet purple with cold on the cold, wet sand. He was      wrapped from head to foot in a coarse blanket, which shook      with the violence of his chill, as if his limbs were about to      drop in pieces. He seemed unconscious of all that was passing;      his long, matted hair hung over his wasted face; his eyes      glared steadily forward with an expression so utterly hopeless      and wild, that I shuddered at seeing it. This was but one of a      number of cases, equally sad and distressing.\"    The hardy and healthy portion of the emigrants, under the stimulating  excitements of the novel circumstances of their situation, seemed to  revel in the exuberance of animal spirits. Each seemed to have adopted  the rule of the wise man: \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, that do  with all thy might.\" They speculated, dug, or gambled, with an almost  reckless energy. All old forms of courtesy had given place to hearty,  blunt good fellowship in their social intercourse. They reminded our  traveler of the Jarls and Norse sea-kings, and in the noisy and almost  fierce revelry of these bearded gold-hunters around their mountain  tires, he seemed to see the brave and jovial Berseckers of the middle  ages.    We cannot forbear quoting a paragraph in relation to the great  question of our time, \"The Organization of Labor.\"        \"In California, no model phalanxes or national workshops      have been necessary. Labor has organized itself, in the best      possible way. The dream of attractive industry is realized;      all are laborers, and equally respectable; the idler and the      gentleman of leisure, to use a phrase of the country, 'can't      shine in these diggings.' Rich merchandise lies in the open      street; and untold wealth in gold dust is protected only      by ragged canvas walls, but thefts and robbery are seldom      heard of. The rich returns of honest labor render harmless      temptations which would prove an overmatch for the average      virtue of New England. The cut-purse and pickpocket in      California find their occupation useless, and become      chevaliers of industry, in a better sense than the term has      ever before admitted of. It will appear natural,\" says our      author, \"that California should be the most democratic country      in the world. The practical equality of all the members of      the community, whatever might be the wealth, intelligence,      or profession of each, was never before so thoroughly      demonstrated. Dress was no gauge of respectability and no      honest occupation, however menial in its character, affected      a man's standing. Lawyers, physicians, and ex-professors,      dug cellars, drove ox-teams, sawed wood, and carried baggage,      while men who had been army privates, sailors, cooks, or day      laborers, were at the head of profitable establishments, and      not unfrequently assisted in some of the minor details of      government. A man who would consider his fellow beneath      him, on account of his appearance or occupation, would have      had some difficulty in living peaceably in California. The      security of the country is owing in no small degree to this      plain, practical development of what the French reverence as      an abstraction, under the name of _Fraternite_. To sum up      all in three words, _Labor is respectable_. May it never      be otherwise while a grain of gold is left to glitter in      Californian soil!\"    Our author returned by way of Mazatlan and the city of Mexico, meeting  with a pleasant variety of adventures, robbery included, on his  route. In taking leave of his volumes, we cannot forbear venturing  a suggestion to the author, that he may find a field of travel, less  known, and quite as interesting at the present time, in the vast  Territory of New Mexico--the valley of the Del Norte, with its old  Castilian and Aztec monuments and associations; the Great Salt Lake,  and the unexplored regions of the great valley of the Colorado,  between the mountain ranges of the Sierra Madre and the Sierra Nevada.  We know of no one better fitted for such an enterprise, or for whom,  judging from the spirit of his California narrative, it would present  more attractions.

One of the last of these beautiful creatures seen in the  waters of our lake occasioned a chase of much interest, though under  very different circumstances from those of a regular hunt. A pretty  little fawn had been brought in very young from the woods, and nursed  and petted by a lady in the village until it had become as tame as  possible. It was graceful, as these little creatures always are, and  so gentle and playful that it became a great favorite, following the  different members of the family about, caressed by the neighbors, and  welcome everywhere. One morning, after gamboling about as usual until  weary, it threw itself down in the sunshine, at the feet of one of its  friends, upon the steps of a store. There came along a countryman, who  for several years had been a hunter by pursuit, and who kept several  dogs: one of his hounds came to the village with him on this occasion.  The dog, as it approached the spot where the fawn lay, suddenly  stopped; the little animal saw him, and started to its feet. It had  lived more than half its life among the village, and had apparently  lost all fear of them; but it seemed now to know instinctly that  an enemy was at hand. In an instant a change came over it, and the  gentleman who related the incident, and who was standing by at the  moment, observed that he had never in his life seen a finer sight  than the sudden arousing of instinct in that beautiful creature. In a  second its whole character and appearance seemed changed, all its past  habits were forgotten, every wild impulse was awake; its head erect,  its nostrils dilated, its eye flashing. In another instant, before the  spectators had thought of the danger, before its friends could secure  it, the fawn was leaping wildly through the street, and the hound in  full pursuit. The bystanders were eager to save it; several persons  instantly followed its track, the friends who had long fed and fondled  it, calling the name it had hitherto known, but in vain. The hunter  endeavored to whistle back his dog, but with no better success. In  half a minute the fawn had turned the first corner, dashed onward  toward the lake, and thrown itself into the water. But, if for a  moment the startled creature believed itself safe in the cool bosom  of the lake, it was soon undeceived; the hound followed in hot and  eager chase, while a dozen of the village dogs joined blindly in  the pursuit. Quite a crowd collected on the bank, men, women, and  children, anxious for the fate of the little animal known to them all:  some threw themselves into boats, hoping to intercept the hound before  he reached his prey; but the plashing"]]]
