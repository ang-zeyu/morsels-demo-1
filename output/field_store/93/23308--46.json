At night, or by blind people, standards belonging to the sense of touch  are used; and it is because on board ship, the standards both of sight  and of touch are lost, that the effect is so very remarkable.    But sea-sickness also partly depends on the irregular pressure of the  bowels against the diaphragm, as their inertia or weight varies with the  rising and falling of the ship.    From the nature of sea-sickness, as discovered in all these facts, it is  seen why persons unaccustomed to the motion of a ship, often find relief  in keeping their eyes directed to the fixed shore, where it is visible;  or in lying down on their backs and shutting their eyes; or in taking  such a dose of exhilarating drink as shall diminish their sensibility to  all objects of external sense.    _Arnott's Elements of Physics._           *       *       *       *       *        FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE BRITISH INSTITUTION.      The following gratifying report of the directors has just been  made:--\"The funds of the institution consist at the present time of  12,500l. 3 per cent, consols. It is hoped that these funds may be  considerably increased by the exhibition of the beautiful collection of  pictures now on view at the gallery, which last year attracted such  general notice, and which his majesty, ever anxious to forward the  purposes of the institution, has again allowed the directors to offer  for the inspection of the public. The directors, finding that the two  institutions which have been established for the relief of decayed  artists, were not only founded upon the most humane principles, but  conducted in the most beneficial manner, have applied in the course of  the present year, 400l, to the purposes of those institutions; viz.  200l. to the Artists' Benevolent Fund, and 200l to the Artists'  General Benevolent Institution.\" The report next mentions two pictures  to be painted on the subjects of Lord Howe's and Lord St. Vincent's  victories, by Mr. Briggs and Mr. Jones, to be placed, \"as well as those  which were exhibited this year in the gallery in commemoration of other  naval victories, in the hall of Greenwich hospital.\" It also confirms  the gift of Mr. Hilton's and Mr. Northcote's pictures to the new church  at Pimlico, built by Mr. Hakewill, and to the chapel built by Mr.  Cockerell, in the upper part of Regent-street.           *       *       *       *       *        ARTS AND SCIENCES.           *       *       *       *       *      MUSICAL COMPOSITION.      A very valuable musical manuscript, by Guillaume de Machault, who was  _valet de chambre_ to Phillippe-le-Bel, in 1307, has been discovered in  the royal library at Paris. It contains several French and Latin  anthems, ballads, &c.; and concludes with a mass, which is supposed to  have been sung at the coronation of Charles V., in 1364; and which  proves, at that time they were acquainted with the art of composition in  four parts.      NOISY FISH.      M. Cuvier lately read a short paper to the French academy on the species  of fish called _pogonias_, in which he particularly adverted to the  noise by which they make themselves heard, even under water. However  difficult the explanation of this phenomenon, there can be no doubt of  its existence; the evidence of it adduced by M. Cuvier being perfectly  satisfactory. The silurus, a large and ravenous fish, which abounds in  the Danube, gives daily proof of it.      GEOLOGY.      A treatise on the great geological question, whether the continents now  inhabited, have or have not been repeatedly submerged in the sea, has  lately been read to the Academie des Sciences, by M. Constant Prevost.  M. Prevost maintains, contrary to the generally received opinion, that  there has been but one great inundation of the earth; and that the  various remains of plants, animals, &c., which have given rise to the  supposition of successive inundations, have been floated to the places  in which they are occasionally found.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.        \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other men's      stuff.\"--Wotton.           *       *       *       *       *      A PUZZLE FOR THE CURIOUS.

The whole party consisted of seven persons only.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ROMANCE OF WAR.      A French soldier, who accompanied the armies of Russia, concealed a  small treasure at the entrance of a village near Wilna, with a view of  taking it with him on his return. After the defeat of Moscow he was made  prisoner, and sent to Siberia, and only recovered his liberty at the end  of last year. On reaching Wilna he remembered his hidden treasure, and  after tracing out the spot where he had hid it, he went to take it away.  What was his astonishment to find, in the place of his money, a small  tin box, containing a letter addressed to him, in which a commercial  house was mentioned at Nancy, where he might receive the sum buried,  with interest, since the year 1812. The soldier supposed this was all a  hoax; he went, however, to the house pointed out, where he received his  capital, with twelve years' interest. With this sum he established a  small business at Nancy, which enables him to live comfortably; but he  has never been able, though he has taken some pains, to ascertain how  his money was taken away and restored to him.           *       *       *       *       *        Two lovely ladies dwell at ----,        And each a-churching goes;      Emma goes there _to close her eyes_,        And Jane to _eye her clothes_.           *       *       *       *       *    The death of Stanislaus, king of Poland, was occasioned in a singular  manner. Being much addicted to smoking, he generally every day finished  many pipes. In knocking out the ashes he set fire to his dressing-gown.  As no one was near him, the flames had surrounded him, when the officer  on guard, hearing his cries, ran to his assistance, and extinguished the  fire. He might have survived, but a singular circumstance accompanied  the accident. He had been devout during the last years of his life, and,  as a penance for his sins, had worn a girdle with points on the inside;  these became heated, and being pressed into his body while the flames  were extinguishing, caused a number of wounds, the discharge from which,  at his period of life, proved too much for his debilitated constitution.           *       *       *       *       *    Professor Porson was often in pecuniary difficulties. On one occasion he  came with a dejected air to a friend, and said he had been walking  through the streets of London all the morning, thinking how strange it  was that not one of all the crowds he met should know as much about  Greek tragic verse as himself, and yet that he could not turn his  knowledge into a hundred pounds. In these moments he often talked of  retiring forever to the wilds of America, where he formed a plan of  living in solitary happiness, without a book or a friend.           *       *       *       *       *    One evening, at the Literary Fund Club, Mr. Incledon having sung with  great effect Mr. T. Dibdin's ballad of \"May we ne'er want a friend, or a  bottle to give him,\" an elderly gentleman whispered in Mr. T. Dibdin's  ear, \"Ah! my dear sir, these are the true things of the old school; what  a pity it is no one living is found to write such ditties now!\"           *       *       *       *       *      _Printed and published by J LIMBIRD, 143, Strand, (near Somerset House,)  and sold by all Newsmen and Booksellers._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#8)"],[1,"  were hastily putting on their clothes, when Mugford, who had just thrown  aside a dirty collar, gave vent to an exclamation of dismay, which  attracted the attention of his two companions.    \"Hullo! what's up?\"    \"Why, look here!  If this beastly bottle of ginger-beer hasn't gone and  burst in the middle of my box!\"    The first meeting of the supper club was a great success.  How ever  Acton and his noble friends had managed to smuggle upstairs, under their  jackets, a pork-pie, a plum-cake, a bag of tarts, and a pound of  biscuits, was a feat which, as Jack Vance remarked, \"beat conjuring.\"    Shortly after midnight the Triple Alliance wended their way to the  \"House of Lords,\" where they found the three other members quite ready  to commence operations.  The good things were spread out on the top of a  chest of drawers, and the company ranged themselves round on the  available chairs and two adjacent beds, and commenced to enjoy the  repast.    \"Ah, well,\" sighed Acton, with his mouth full of pork-pie, \"I'm rather  glad for some things that I didn't get engaged.  It must be rather a  bore having to spend all your money in rings and that sort of thing,  instead of in grub; though I really think I'd have given up grub for  Miss Eleanor.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Morris, who was of a more prosaic disposition, \"how it  is that it's always much jollier having a feed when you ought not to  than at the proper time.  For instance, eating this pork-pie at a table,  with knife and fork and a plate, wouldn't be a quarter the fun it is  having it like we're doing now--cutting it with a razor out of Acton's  dressing-case, and knowing that if we were cobbed we should get into a  jolly row.\"    \"Talking about rows over feeds,\" said Acton, \"my brother John is at  Ronleigh College, and I remember, soon after he went there, he said they  had a great spree in his dormitory.  One of the chaps had had a hamper  sent him, and they smuggled the grub upstairs; and when they thought the  coast was clear, they spread a sheet on the floor, and laid out the grub  as if it were on a table-cloth.  The fellow who was standing treat was  rather a swell in his way, and among other things he'd got his jam put  out in a flat glass dish.  It was a fine feed, and they'd just begun,  when they heard some one coming.  They'd only just got time to turn out  the gas and jump into bed before the door opened, and in came one of the  masters called Weston.  Well, of course, they all pretended to be  asleep.  But the master had heard them scrambling about, and he walked  in the dark up the aisle between the beds, saying, 'Who's been out of  bed here?'  Then all of a sudden he stuck his foot into the glass  jam-dish, and it slid along the floor, and down he came bang in the  middle of all the spread.  John said that when the gas was lit they  couldn't help laughing at old Weston: he'd rammed one elbow into a box  of sardines, and there was a cheese-cake stuck in the middle of his  back.  But oh, there was a row, I can tell you!\"    This yarn produced others, and the time passed pleasantly enough, until  full justice had been done to the provisions, and hardly a crumb  remained.    \"Phew! isn't it hot?\" said Diggory; \"let's open the window a bit.  The moon must be full,\" he continued, as he raised the sash; \"it's  nearly as light as day.  I can see all down the garden, and--hullo!  quick, put the candle out!\"    Every one started to his feet, and the light was extinguished in a  moment.    \"What is it--what's the matter?\" they all asked.  \"There's some one in  the playground,\" whispered Diggory, as the others crowded round him.  \"You see the door at the bottom of the garden; well, just when I spoke  some one opened it and looked up at the house, and then shut it again.  It must have been Blake, and he's seen our light.\"    \"It can't be Blake,\" answered Acton; \"he's gone to Fenley to play in a  cricket match, and isn't coming back till to-morrow morning.  Old Welsby  went to bed hours ago; and, besides, what should either of them want to  be doing down there at this time of night?  You must have been dreaming,  Diggy.\"    \"No, I wasn't; I saw it distinctly.  It must be old Blake.  He's come  home sooner than he expected, and  I shouldn't wonder if he's going  round by the road to take us by surprise.\"    \"He can't do that,\" answered Acton, \"because I've got the key of the  shed, and the door-key's hung up inside.\"    Acton remained watching at the window while the others hastily cleared  away all traces of the feast; the Triple Alliance retired to their own  room, and nothing further was heard or seen of the mysterious visitor.    The next morning it was discovered that Mr. Blake had not returned from  Fenley, and the five other members of the supper club were inclined to  regard Diggory's vision of the midnight intruder as a sort of waking  nightmare, resulting from an overdose of cake and pork-pie.  Two days  later Cross came into the schoolroom in a great state of excitement.    \"Look here, you fellows,\" he exclaimed: \"some one keeps taking away my  things out of the shed, and not putting them back.  Last week I missed a  saw and two chisels, and now that brace and nearly all the bits are  gone.  It's a jolly shame!\"    Carpentering was Cross's great hobby, and his collection of tools was an  exceptionally good one, both as regards quantity and quality.  Every  one, however, denied having touched the things mentioned.  A general  search was made; but the missing articles could not be found, and at  length the matter was reported to Mr. Welsby.    The latter was evidently greatly displeased on hearing the facts of the  case.  As soon as dinner was over he called the school together, and  after standing for some moments in silence, frowning at the book he  carried in his hand, said briefly,--    \"With regard to these tools, there is a word which has never been used  before in connection with any pupil at The Birches, and which I hope I  may never have occasion to use again.  I can hardly think it possible  that we have a _thief_ in the house.  I am rather inclined to imagine  that some one has removed the things and hidden them away in joke; if  so, let me tell him that the joke has been allowed to go too far, and  that, unless they are returned at once, a shadow of doubt will be cast  upon the honour and integrity of all here present.  It is impossible for  such large articles as a saw and a brace to be mislaid or lost on such  small premises as these, and I trust that before this evening you will  report to me that the things have been found.  I have purposely allowed  the key of the shed to remain in your own possession, feeling certain  that your behaviour as regards each other's property would be in  accordance with the treatment which one gentleman expects to receive  from another.  You may go.\"    There was little in the nature of a scolding in this address, and yet  something in it caused every one to leave the room in a state of great  excitement.  Acton and Jack Vance especially fairly boiled with wrath.    \"What old Welsby says is quite right,\" remarked the latter; \"and until  those things are found, we may all be looked upon as thieves.\"    The search, however, proved fruitless; and, what was worse, in turning  over the contents of the shed, Acton discovered that a bull's-eye  lantern belonging to himself had disappeared from the shelf on which it  usually stood; while Mugford declared that a box of compasses, which he  had brought down a few days before to draw a pattern on a piece of  board, was also missing.    Directly after tea Acton button-holed Diggory, and taking him aside  said, \"Look here, I'm in an awful rage about these thing's being  prigged, because, of course, I've got the key of the shed; and didn't  you hear what old Welsby said about it?  It looks uncommonly as if I  were the thief.  You remember what you said the other night when we had  that feed, about seeing that man?  D'you think there _is_ any one who  comes here at night and steals things?\"    \"Well, I'm certain I saw some one in the playground when I told you.  It was a man; but whether he comes regularly and goes into the shed I  don't know, but I think we ought to be able to find out.\"    \"How?\"    \"Oh, some way or other; I'll tell you to-morrow.\"  That night, long  after the rest of the house were asleep, the Triple Alliance lay awake  engaged in earnest conversation; and in the morning, as the boys were  assembling for breakfast, Diggory touched Acton on the shoulder and  whispered,--    \"I say, we've thought of a plan to find out if any one goes into the  shed at night.\"    \"Who's 'we'?\"    \"Why, the Triple Alliance; we thought it out between us.  Sneak out of  the house directly after evening 'prep,' and meet me in the playground,  and I'll show you what it is.\"    At the time appointed Acton ran down the path, and found Diggory waiting  for him by the shed.    \"Look,\" said the latter, \"I've cut a little tiny slit with my knife in  each door-post, about three feet from the ground, and I'm going to  stretch this piece of black cotton between them.  No one will see it,  and if they go through the door, the thread will simply draw out of one  of the slits without their noticing it, and we shall see that it's been  disturbed.  Jack Vance says that when he's been out shooting with his  guv'nor he's seen the keeper put them across the paths in a wood to find  out if poachers have been up them.  Now unlock the door, and let's go  inside.\"    In front of the bench, where the ground had been much trodden, there was  a great deal of loose dust.  Diggory went down on his hands and knees,  and producing an old clothes-brush from his pocket, swept about a square  yard of the ground until the dust lay in a perfectly smooth surface.    \"There,\" he said, rising to his feet again; \"we'll do this the last  thing every night, and any morning if we find the cotton gone we must  "]]]
