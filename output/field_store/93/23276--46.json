[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#7)"],[1," something else to do  than to look after the boys. So for them it was a continual life in the  open air, which makes the body strong and hard. Augustin and his companions  should be pictured as young wild-cats.    This roughness came out strong at games of ball, and generally at all  the games in which there are two sides, conquerors and prisoners, or  fights with sticks and stones. Stone-throwing is an incurable habit  among the little Africans. Even now in the towns our police are obliged  to take measures against these ferocious children. In Augustin's time,  at Cherchell, which is the ancient _Caesarea Mauretaniae_, the childish  population was split into two hostile camps which stoned each other. On  certain holidays the fathers and big brothers joined the children; blood  flowed, and there were deaths.    The bishop Augustin recalls with severity the \"superb victories\" he won in  jousts of this kind. But I find it hard to believe that such a delicate  child (he was sickly almost all his life) could have got much pleasure out  of these brutal sports. If he was drawn into them by the example of others,  it must have been through the imagination they appealed to him. In these  battles, wherein sides took the field as Romans against Carthaginians,  Greeks against Trojans, he believed himself Scipio or Hannibal, Achilles  or Hector. He experienced beforehand, as a rhetorician, the intoxication  of a triumph which playfellows who were stronger and better provided with  muscles gave him a hard fight for. He did not always get the upper hand,  except perhaps when he bribed the enemy. But an eager young soul, such  as he was, can hardly be content with half-victories; he wants to excel.  Accordingly, he sought his revenge in those games wherein the mind has the  chief part. He listened to stories with delight, and in his turn repeated  them to his little friends, thus trying upon an audience of boys that charm  of speech by which later he was to subdue crowds. They also played at  acting, at gladiators, at drivers and horses. Some of Augustin's companions  were sons of wealthy citizens who gave splendid entertainments to their  fellow-countrymen. As these dramatic representations, or games of the  arena or circus, drew near, the little child-world was overcome by a  fever of imitation. All the children of Thagaste imitated the actors, the  _mirmillones_, or the horsemen in the amphitheatre, just as the young  Spaniards of to-day imitate the _toreros_.    In the midst of these amusements Augustin fell ill; he had fever and  violent pains in the stomach. They thought he was going to die. It appears  that it was himself who in this extreme situation asked for baptism.  Monnica was making all haste to have the sacrament administered, when  suddenly, against all expectation, the child recovered. Again was baptism  postponed, and from the same reason: to lessen the gravity of the sins  which young Augustin was bound to commit. His mother, who no doubt foresaw  some of them, again fell in with the custom.    It is possible that Patricius interfered this time in a more decided way.  Just at this period Catholicism was in an unfavourable situation. The  short reign of Julian had started a violent pagan reaction. Everywhere  the temples were reopening, the sacrifices beginning again. Moreover,  the Donatists secretly aided the pagans. Their _Seids_, more or less  acknowledged, the Circoncelliones, bands of fanatical peasants, scoured  through the Numidian country, attacking the Catholics, ravaging and  pillaging, and burning their farms and villas. Was this a good time to  make a noisy profession of faith, to be enrolled among the ranks of the  conquered party?    Little Augustin knew nothing of all these calculations of motherly prudence  and fatherly diplomacy: he begged for baptism, so he tells us. This seems  very remarkable in so young a child. But he lived in a house where all the  service was done by Christians. He heard the talk of Monnica's friends;  perhaps, too, of his grandparents, who were Catholics faithful and austere.  And then, his soul was naturally religious. That explains everything:  he asked for baptism to be like grown-up people, and because he was  predestined. Among children, the chosen have these sudden flashes of light.  At certain moments they feel what one day they shall be. Anyhow, Monnica  must have seen this sign with joy.    He got well, and took up again his little boy's life, divided between play,  and dawdling, and school.    School! painful memory for Augustin! They sent him to the _primus  magister_, the elementary teacher, a real terror, armed with a long switch  which came down without pity on idle boys. Seated on benches around him, or  crouched on mats, the boys sang out all together: \"One and one are two, two  and two are four\"--horrible refrain which deafened the whole neighbourhood.  The school was often a mere shed, or a _pergola_ in the fields which was  protected fairly well from sun and rain by cloths stretched overhead--a hut  rented for a trifle, wide open to the winds, with a mosquito-net stretched  out before the entrance. All who were there must have frozen in winter  and broiled in summer. Augustin remembered it as a slaves' chain-prison  (_ergastulum_) of boyhood.    He hated school and what they taught there--the alphabet, counting, and  the rudiments of Latin and Greek grammar. He had a perfect horror of  lessons--of Greek above all. This schoolboy, who became, when his turn  came, a master, objected to the methods of school. His mind, which grasped  things instinctively at a single bound, could not stand the gradual  procedure of the teaching faculty. He either mastered difficulties at  once, or gave them up. Augustin was one of the numerous victims of the  everlasting mistake of schoolmasters, who do not know how to arrange  their lessons to accord with various kinds of mind. Like most of those  who eventually become great men, he was no good as a pupil. He was often  punished, thrashed--and cruelly thrashed. The master's scourge filled  him with an unspeakable terror. When he was smarting all over from cuts  and came to complain to his parents, they laughed at him or made fun of  him--yes, even the pious Monnica. Then the poor lad, not knowing whom to  turn to, remembered hearing his mother and the servants talk of a Being,  very powerful and very good, who defends the orphan and the oppressed. And  he said from the depths of his heart:    \"O my God, please grant that I am not whipped at school.\"    But God did not hear his prayer because he was not a good boy. Augustin was  in despair.    It is evident that these punishments were cruel, because forty years  afterwards he denounces them with horror. In his mind, they are tortures  comparable to the wooden horse or the iron pincers. Nothing is small  for children, especially for a sensitive child like Augustin. Their  sensitiveness and their imagination exaggerate all things out of due  measure. In this matter, also, schoolmasters often go wrong. They do not  know how to handle delicate organizations. They strike fiercely, when a  few words said at the right moment would have much more effect on the  culprit.... Monnica's son suffered as much from the rod as he took pride  in his successes at games. If, as Scipio, he was filled with a sensation  of glory in his battles against other boys, no doubt he pictured himself  a martyr, a St. Laurence or St. Sebastian, when he was swished. He never  pardoned--save as a Christian--his schoolmasters for having brutalized him.    Nevertheless, despite his hatred for ill-ordered lessons, his precocious  intelligence was remarked by everybody. It was clear that such lucky gifts  should not be neglected. Monnica, no doubt, was the first to get this into  her head, and she advised Patricius to make Augustin read for a learned  profession.    The business of the _curia_ was not exactly brilliant, and so he may have  perceived that his son might raise their fortunes if he had definite  employment. Augustin, a professor of eloquence or a celebrated pleader,  might be the saviour and the benefactor of his family. The town councils,  and even the Imperial treasury, paid large salaries to rhetoricians. In  those days, rhetoric led to everything. Some of the professors who went  from town to town giving lectures made considerable fortunes. At Thagaste  they pointed with admiration to the example of the rhetorician Victorinus,  an African, a fellow-countryman, who had made a big reputation over-seas,  and had his statue in the Roman Forum. And many years before, had not M.  Cornelius Fronto, of Cirta, another African, become the tutor of Marcus  Aurelius, who covered him with honours and wealth and finally raised him to  the Consulship? Pertinax himself, did he not begin as a simple teacher of  grammar, and become Proconsul of Africa and then Emperor of Rome? How many  stimulants for provincial ambition!...    Augustin's parents reasoned as the middle-class parents of to-day. They  discounted the future, and however hard up they were, they resolved to  make sacrifices for his education. And as the schools of Thagaste were  inadequate, it was decided to send this very promising boy to Madaura.          V    THE SCHOOLBOY OF MADAURA      A new world opened before Augustin. It was perhaps the first time he had  ever gone away from Thagaste.    Of course, Madaura is not very far off; there are about thirty miles at  most between the two towns. But there are no short journeys for children.  This one lay along the military road which ran from Hippo to Theveste--a  great Roman causeway paved with large flags on the outskirts of towns, and  carefully pebbled over all the rest of the distance. Erect upon the high  saddle of his horse, Augustin, who was to become a tireless traveller  and move about ceaselessly over African roads during all his episcopal  life--Augustin got his first glimpse of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#7)"],[1,"ministeriis, utuntur. Suam quisque sedem, suos penates regit. Frumenti  modum dominus, aut pecoris aut vestis, ut colono, injungit: et servus  hactenus paret; cetera domus officia uxor ac liberi exsequuntur.  Verberare servum ac vinculis et opere coercere, rarum. Occidere solent,  non disciplina et severitate, sed impetu et ira, ut inimicum, nisi quod  impune. Liberti non multum supra servos sunt, raro aliquod momentum in  domo, nunquam in civitate; exceptis duntaxat iis gentibus, quae  regnantur: ibi enim et super ingenuos et super nobiles ascendunt: apud  ceteros impares libertini libertatis argumentum sunt.    XXVI. Fenus agitare et in usuras extendere, igno tum: ideoque magis  servatur, quam si vetitum esset. Agri pro numero cultorum ab universis in  vices occupantur, quos mox inter se secundum dignationem partiuntur:  facilitatem partiendi camporum spatia praestant. Arva per annos mutant:  et superest ager; nec enim cum ubertate et amplitudine soli labore  contendunt, ut pomaria conserant et prata separent et hortos rigent: sola  terrae seges imperatur. Unde annum quoque ipsum non in totidem digerunt  species hiems et ver et aestas intellectum ac vocabula habent autumni  perinde nomen ac bona ignorantur.    XXVII. Funerum nulla ambitio; id solum observatur, ut corpora clarorum  virorum certis lignis crementur. Struem rogi nec vestibus nec odoribus  cumulant: sua cuique arma, quorundam igni et equus adjicitur. Sepulcrum  caespes erigit; monumentorum arduum et operosum honorem, ut gravem  defunctis, aspernantur. Lamenta ac lacrimas cito, dolorem et tristitiam  tarde ponunt. Feminis lugere honestum est; viris meminisse. Haec in  commune de omnium Germanorum origine ac moribus accepimus: nunc  singularum gentium instituta ritusque, quatenus differant, quae nationes  e Germania in Gallias commigraverint, expediam.    XXVIII. Validiores olim Gallorum res fuisse, summus auctorum divus Julius  tradit: eoque credibile est etiam Gallos in Germaniam transgressos.  Quantulum enim amnis obstabat, quo minus, ut quaeque gens evaluerat,  occuparet permutaretque sedes, promiscuas adhuc et nulla regnorum  potentia divisas? Igitur inter Hercyniam sylvam Rhenumque et Moenum amnes  Helvetii, ulteriora Boii, Gallica utraque gens, tenuere. Manet adhuc  _Boihemi_ nomen, signatque loci veterem memoriam, quamvis mutatis  cultoribus. Sed utrum Aravisci in Pannoniam ab Osis, Germanorum natione,  an Osi ab Araviscis in Germaniam commigraverint, cum eodem adhuc sermone,  institutis, moribus utantur, incertum est: quia, pari olim inopia ac  libertate, eadem utriusque ripae bona malaque erant. Treveri et Nervii  circa affectationem Germanicae originis ultro ambitiosi sunt, tanquam per  hanc gloriam sanguinis a similitudine et inertia Gallorum separentur.  Ipsam Rheni ripam haud dubie Germanorum populi colunt, Vangiones,  Triboci, Nemetes. Ne Ubii quidem, quanquam Romana colonia esse meruerint  ac libentius Agrippinenses conditoris sui nomine vocentur, origine  erubescunt, transgressi olim et experimento fidei super ipsam Rheni ripam  collocati, ut arcerent, non ut custodirentur.    XXIX. Omnium harum gentium virtute praecipui Batavi, non multum ex ripa,  sed insulam Rheni amnis colunt, Chattorum quondam populus et seditione  domestica in eas sedes transgressus, in quibus pars Romani imperii  fierent. Manet honos et antiquae societatis insigne: nam nec tributis  contemnuntur, nec publicanis atterit: exempti oneribus et collationibus  et tantum in usum proeliorum sepositi, velut tela atque arma, bellis  reservantur. Est in eodem obsequio et Mattiacorum gens; protulit enim  magnitudo populi Romani ultra Rhenum, ultraque veteres terminos, imperii  reverentiam. Ita sede finibusque in sua ripa, mente animoque nobiscum  agunt, cetera similes Batavis, nisi quod ipso adhuc terrae suae solo et  coelo acrius animantur. Non numeraverim inter Germaniae populos, quanquam  trans Rhenum Danubiumque consederint, eos, qui Decumates agros exercent.  Levissimus quisque Gallorum et inopia audax, dubiae possessionis solum  occupavere. Mox limite acto promotisque praesidiis, sinus imperii et pars  provinciae habentur.    XXX. Ultra hos Chatti initium sedis ab Hercynio saltu inchoant, non ita  effusis ac palustribus locis ut ceterae civitates, in quas Germania  patescit; durant siquidem colles, paulatim rarescunt, et Chattos suos  saltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit. Duriora genti corpora,  stricti artus, minax vultus et major animi vigor. Multum, ut inter  Germanos, rationis ac solertiae: praeponere electos, audire praepositos,  nosse ordines, intelligere occasiones, differre impetus, disponere diem,  vallare noctem, fortunam inter dubia, virtutem inter certa numerare:  quodque rarissimum nec nisi ratione disciplinae concessum, plus reponere  in duce, quam exercitu. Omne robur in pedite, quem, super arma,  ferramentis quoque et copiis onerant. Alios ad proelium ire videas,  Chattos ad bellum. Rari excursus et fortuita pugna; equestrium sane  virium id proprium, cito parare victoriam, cito cedere: velocitas juxta  formidinem, cunctatio propior constantiae est.    XXXI. Et aliis Germanorum populis usurpatum rara et privata cujusque  audentia apud Chattos in consensum vertit, ut primum adoleverint, crinem  barbamque submittere, nec, nisi hoste caeso, exuere votivum obligatumque  virtuti oris habitum. Super sanguinem et spolia revelant frontem, seque  tum demum pretia nascendi retulisse, dignosque patria ac parentibus  ferunt. Ignavis et imbellibus manet squalor. Fortissimus quisque ferreum  insuper annulum (ignominiosum id genti) velut vinculum gestat, donec se  caede hostis absolvat. Plurimis Chattorum hic placet habitus. Jamque  canent insignes, et hostibus simul suisque monstrati. Omnium penes hos  initia pugnarum: haec prima semper acies, visu nova; nam ne in pace  quidem vultu mitiore mansuescunt. Nulli domus aut ager aut aliqua cura:  prout ad quemque venere, aluntur: prodigi alieni, contemptores sui donec  exsanguis senectus tam durae virtuti impares faciat.    XXXII. Proximi Chattis certum jam alveo Rhenum, quique terminus esse  sufficiat, Usipii ac Tencteri colunt. Tencteri, super solitum bellorum  decus, equestris disciplinae arte praecellunt: nec major apud Chattos  peditum laus, quam Tencteris equitum. Sic instituere majores, posteri  imitantur; hi lusus infantium, haec juvenum aemulatio, perseverant senes  inter familiam et penates et jura successionum equi traduntur; excipit  filius, non, ut cetera, maximus natu, sed prout ferox bello et melior.    XXXIII. Juxta Tencteros Bructeri olim occurrebant: nunc Chamavos et  Angrivarios immigrasse narratur, pulsis Bructeris ac penitus excisis  vicinarum consensu nationum, seu superbiae odio, seu praedae dulcedine,  seu favore quodam erga nos deorum: nam ne spectaculo quidem proelii  invidere: super sexaginta millia, non armis telisque Romanis, sed, quod  magnificentius est, oblectationi oculisque ceciderunt. Maneat, quaeso,  duretque gentibus, si non amor nostri, at certe odium sui: quando,  urgentibus imperii fatis, nihil jam praestare fortuna majus potest, quam  hostium discordiam.    XXXIV. Angrivarios et Chamavos a tergo Dulgibini et Chasuarii cludunt  aliaeque gentes, haud perinde memoratae. A fronte Frisii excipiunt.  Majoribus minoribusque Frisiis vocabulum est ex modo virium: utraeque  nationes usque ad Oceanum Rheno praetexuntur, ambiuntque immensos insuper  lacus et Romanis classibus navigatos. Ipsum quin etiam Oceanum illa  tentavimus: et superesse adhuc Herculis columnas fama vulgavit; sive  adiit Hercules, seu, quicquid ubique magnificum est, in claritatem ejus  referre consensimus. Nec defuit audentia Druso Germanico: sed obstitit  Oceanus in se simul atque in Herculem inquiri. Mox nemo tentavit;  sanctiusque ac reverentius visum, de actis deorum credere, quam scire.    XXXV. Hactenus in Occidentem Germaniam novimus. In Septentrionem ingenti  flexu redit. Ac primo statim Chaucorum gens, quanquam incipiat a Frisiis  ac partem littoris occupet, omnium, quas exposui, gentium lateribus  obtenditur, donec in Chattos usque sinuetur. Tam immensum terrarum  spatium non tenent tantum Chauci, sed et implent: populus inter Germanos  nobilissimus, quique magnitudinem suam malit justitia tueri: sine  cupiditate, sine impotentia, quieti secretique, nulla provocant bella,  nullis raptibus aut latrociniis populantur. Id praecipuum virtutis ac  virium argumentum est, quod, ut superiores agant, non per injurias  assequuntur. Prompta tamen omnibus arma, ac, si res poscat, exercitus,  plurimum virorum equorumque: et quiescentibus eadem fama.    XXXVI. In latere Chaucorum Chattorumque Cherusci nimiam ac marcentem diu  pacem illacessiti nutrierunt; idque jucundius, quam tutius, fuit: quia  inter impotentes et validos falso quiescas; ubi manu agitur, modestia ac  probitas nomina superioris sunt. Ita, qui olim boni aequique Cherusci,  nunc inertes ac stulti vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna in sapientiam  cessit. Tracti ruina Cheruscorum et Fosi, contermina gens, adversarum  rerum ex aequo socii, cum in secundis minores fuissent.    XXXVII. Eundem Germaniae sinum proximi Oceano Cimbri tenent, parva nunc  civitas, sed gloria ingens; veterisque famae lata vestigia manent,  utraque ripa castra ac spatia, quorum ambitu nunc quoque metiaris molem  manusque gentis et tam magni exitus fidem. Sexcentesimum et quadragesimum  annum urbs nostra agebat, cum primum Cimbrorum audita sunt arma, Caecilio  Metello et Papirio Carbone consulibus. Ex quo si ad alterum Imperatoris  Trajani consulatum computemus, ducenti ferme et decem anni colliguntur;  tamdiu Germania vincitur. Medio tam longi aevi spatio, multa invicem  damna: non Samnis, non Poeni, non Hispaniae Galliaeve, ne Parthi quidem  saepius admonuere: quippe regno Arsacis acrior est Germanorum libertas.  Quid enim aliud nobis, quam caedem Crassi, amisso et ipse Pacoro, infra  Ventidium dejectus Oriens objecerit? At Germani, Carbone et Cassio et"]]]
