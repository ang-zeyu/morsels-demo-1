The gardens are on the south of the house, and extend themselves beyond  the river, a branch of which runs through one part of them, and still  south of the gardens in the great park, which, extending beyond the vale,  mounts the hill opening at the last to the great down, which is properly  called, by way of distinction, Salisbury Plain, and leads from the city  of Salisbury to Shaftesbury.  Here also his lordship has a hare-warren,  as it is called, though improperly.  It has, indeed, been a sanctuary for  the hares for many years; but the gentlemen complain that it mars their  game, for that as soon as they put up a hare for their sport, if it be  anywhere within two or three miles, away she runs for the warren, and  there is an end of their pursuit; on the other hand, it makes all the  countrymen turn poachers, and destroy the hares by what means they can.  But this is a smaller matter, and of no great import one way or other.    From this pleasant and agreeable day's work I returned to Clarendon, and  the next day took another short tour to the hills to see that celebrated  piece of antiquity, the wonderful Stonehenge, being six miles from  Salisbury, north, and upon the side of the River Avon, near the town of  Amesbury.  It is needless that I should enter here into any part of the  dispute about which our learned antiquaries have so puzzled themselves  that several books (and one of them in folio) have been published about  it; some alleging it to be a heathen or pagan temple and altar, or place  of sacrifice, as Mr. Jones; others a monument or trophy of victory;  others a monument for the dead, as Mr. Aubrey, and the like.  Again, some  will have it be British, some Danish, some Saxon, some Roman, and some,  before them all, Phoenician.    I shall suppose it, as the majority of all writers do, to be a monument  for the dead, and the rather because men's bones have been frequently dug  up in the ground near them.  The common opinion that no man could ever  count them, that a baker carried a basket of bread and laid a loaf upon  every stone, and yet never could make out the same number twice, this I  take as a mere country fiction, and a ridiculous one too.  The reason why  they cannot easily be told is that many of them lie half or part buried  in the ground; and a piece here and a piece there only appearing above  the grass, it cannot be known easily which belong to one stone and which  to another, or which are separate stones, and which are joined  underground to one another; otherwise, as to those which appear, they are  easy to be told, and I have seen them told four times after one another,  beginning every time at a different place, and every time they amounted  to seventy-two in all; but then this was counting every piece of a stone  of bulk which appeared above the surface of the earth, and was not  evidently part of and adjoining to another, to be a distinct and separate  body or stone by itself.    The form of this monument is not only described but delineated in most  authors, and, indeed, it is hard to know the first but by the last.  The  figure was at first circular, and there were at least four rows or  circles within one another.  The main stones were placed upright, and  they were joined on the top by cross-stones, laid from one to another,  and fastened with vast mortises and tenons.  Length of time has so  decayed them that not only most of the cross-stones which lay on the top  are fallen down, but many of the upright also, notwithstanding the weight  of them is so prodigious great.  How they came thither, or from whence  (no stones of that kind being now to be found in that part of England  near it) is still the mystery, for they are of such immense bulk that no  engines or carriages which we have in use in this age could stir them.    Doubtless they had some method in former days in foreign countries, as  well as here, to move heavier weights than we find practicable now.  How  else did Solomon's workmen build the battlement or additional wall to  support the precipice of Mount Moriah, on which the Temple was built,  which was all built of stones of Parian marble, each stone being forty  cubits long and fourteen cubits broad, and eight cubits high or thick,  which, reckoning each cubit at two feet and a half of our measure (as the  learned agree to do), was one hundred feet long, thirty-five feet broad,  and twenty feet thick?    These stones at Stonehenge, as Mr. Camden describes them, and in which  others agree, were very large, though not so large--the upright stones  twenty-four feet high, seven feet broad, sixteen feet round, and weigh  twelve tons each; and the cross-stones on the top, which he calls  coronets, were six or seven tons.  But this does not seem equal; for if  the cross-stones weighed six or seven tons, the others, as they appear  now, were at least five or six times as big, and must weigh in  proportion; and therefore I must think their judgment much nearer the  case who judge the upright stones at sixteen tons or thereabouts  (supposing them to stand a great way into the earth, as it is not doubted  but they do), and the coronets or cross-stones at about two tons, which  is very large too, and as much as their bulk can be thought to allow.    Upon the whole, we must take them as our ancestors have done--namely, for  an erection or building so ancient that no history has handed down to us  the original.  As we find it, then, uncertain, we must leave it so.  It  is indeed a reverend piece of antiquity, and it is a great loss that the  true history of it is not known.  But since it is not, I think the making  so many conjectures at the reality, when they know lots can but guess at  it, and, above all, the insisting so long and warmly on their private  opinions, is but amusing themselves and us with a doubt, which perhaps  lies the deeper for their search into it.    The downs and plains in this part of England being so open, and the  surface so little subject to alteration, there are more remains of  antiquity to be seen upon them than in other places.  For example, I  think they tell us there are three-and-fifty ancient encampments or  fortifications to be seen in this one county--some whereof are exceeding  plain to be seen; some of one form, some of another; some of one nation,  some of another--British, Danish, Saxon, Roman--as at Ebb Down, Burywood,  Oldburgh Hill, Cummerford, Roundway Down, St. Ann's Hill, Bratton Castle,  Clay Hill, Stournton Park, Whitecole Hill, Battlebury, Scrathbury,  Tanesbury, Frippsbury, Southbury Hill, Amesbury, Great Bodwin, Easterley,  Merdon, Aubery, Martenscil Hill, Barbury Castle, and many more.    Also the barrows, as we all agree to call them, are very many in number  in this county, and very obvious, having suffered very little decay.  These are large hillocks of earth cast up, as the ancients agree, by the  soldiers over the bodies of their dead comrades slain in battle; several  hundreds of these are to be seen, especially in the north part of this  county, about Marlborough and the downs, from thence to St. Ann's Hill,  and even every way the downs are full of them.    I have done with matters of antiquity for this county, unless you will  admit me to mention the famous Parliament in the reign of Henry II. held  at Clarendon, where I am now writing, and another intended to be held  there in Richard II.'s time, but prevented by the barons, being then up  in arms against the king.    Near this place, at Farlo, was the birthplace of the late Sir Stephen  Fox, and where the town, sharing in his good fortune, shows several marks  of his bounty, as particularly the building a new church from the  foundation, and getting an Act of Parliament passed for making it  parochial, it being but a chapel-of-ease before to an adjoining parish.  Also Sir Stephen built and endowed an almshouse here for six poor women,  with a master and a free school.  The master is to be a clergyman, and to  officiate in the church--that is to say, is to have the living, which,  including the school, is very sufficient.    I am now to pursue my first design, and shall take the west part of  Wiltshire in my return, where are several things still to be taken notice  of, and some very well worth our stay.  In the meantime I went on to  Langborough, a fine seat of my Lord Colerain, which is very well kept,  though the family, it seems, is not much in this country, having another  estate and dwelling at Tottenham High Cross, near London.    From hence in my way to the seaside I came to New Forest, of which I have  said something already with relation to the great extent of ground which  lies waste, and in which there is so great a quantity of large timber, as  I have spoken of already.    This waste and wild part of the country was, as some record, laid open  and waste for a forest and for game by that violent tyrant William the  Conqueror, and for which purpose he unpeopled the country, pulled down  the houses, and, which was worse, the churches of several parishes or  towns, and of abundance of villages, turning the poor people out of their  habitations and possessions, and laying all open for his deer.  The same  histories likewise record that two of his own blood and posterity, and  particularly his immediate successor William Rufus, lost their lives in  this forest--one, viz., the said William Rufus, being shot with an arrow  directed at a deer which the king and his company were hunting, and the  arrow, glancing on a tree, changed his course, and struck the king full  on the breast and killed him.  This they relate as a just judgment of God  on the cruel devastation made here by the Conqueror.   Be it so or not,  as Heaven pleases; but that the king was so killed is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#8)"],[1,"system be profitably adapted to small  works?\" In answer to this, I will say I have proved that it can. During  last summer the manager of a small gas works in my neighborhood called  on me regarding the working of this system, and expressed a desire, if  it was at all possible to adapt it to his present settings without much  expense, to try it. I must say I admired his progressive spirit and  pluck; and, after a somewhat lengthy conversation with him, during which  I gathered the full details of his working and his requirements, I  determined to encourage him in his desire to prove if it could be  successfully applied to a works of the size mentioned. The present  setting consisted of three [semicircle] retorts in one arch; and one of  his stipulations to me was: \"You must so contrive the setting that if it  should prove a failure I can reconvert it into the old system in a few  hours.\" I at once saw that the stipulation was reasonable, or he might  be caught in a fix in midwinter. But, with true \"Scotch caution\" and  forethought, he was, while anxious to experiment, determined not to be  \"caught napping.\" After some consideration, I prepared a sketch for him  of how I thought it could be done, and at the same time comply with his  stipulation; and having received full explanations, he set about it, and  has had it working now for something like six months. His experience has  been somewhat similar to that of most of those who have gone in for the  new system. It did not answer very well at first. But after a little  manipulation and experience in the proper working and management, it is  now acting in first rate style, and is saving fuel, with better and more  regular heats; and this although it is not constructed in such a way as  to yield the best possible results, owing to the before mentioned  stipulation having to be considered and allowed for in construction.    In answer to an inquiry I made the other day, the gentleman referred to  informed me that he has now had this setting in operation for six  months. He has three retorts, 14 by 16 inches, and 8 feet long, in an  oven carbonizing 2 cwt. of coal every four hours; the heats are higher  and more regular; and the retorts easier kept clear of carbon. The coke  drawn from the top retort is sufficient for fuel. My oven would hold  four retorts; and the same fuel would heat this number just as well as  the three. I used only the coke from Cowdenheath parrot coal for this  setting; but had to mix it with Burghlee coke for the old system of  setting.    No doubt most of you will have noticed the satisfactory results obtained  by Mr. Hack, of the Saltley Gas Works, Birmingham, and by Mr. McMinn, of  Kensal Green, with the furnaces employed by them for gaseous firing  without recuperation, whereby they are enabled to save fuel and  carbonize more coal per mouthpiece than with the old system. Still they  admit that the saving by this setting is only in fuel, with increased  production, but without any economy of labor--one of the points in favor  of regenerative setting being a saving of at least 25 per cent. in the  latter respect. Even where regenerative settings cannot be had, I think  the system of using gaseous fuel is well worthy the attention of  managers; the expense of altering the existing settings to this method  being very small.      IMPROVEMENTS IN GAS PURIFICATION.    I must now, however, pass on to some other topics. After the proper  production of the gas, we have still the processes of purification to  consider, and how this operation can best be effected at the smallest  cost, combined with efficiency and the least possible annoyance to  residents in the immediate vicinity of gas works. I think all gas  engineers are agreed that in ammoniacal liquor we have a useful and  powerful purifying agent, although each one may have his own particular  idea of how this can be most efficiently applied--some advocating  scrubbers, others washers. But these are things which each one must  determine for himself. But in whatever way it is applied, we know that  it can be profitably used for this purpose; and I am not without hope  that it may soon be found possible to remove nearly all the impurities  by this means.    At present, however, this is not so. And consequently we have a variety  of other methods employed for the complete removal of the impurities.  But, by whatever means it is effected, it is unquestionably the duty of  the gas engineer to send out to the public an article from which the  whole of the impurities have been removed.    In Scotland, no doubt, our chief purifying material is lime, although I  know that several of our friends have for some time been using oxide of  iron, and perhaps they will favor us with their experience and a  statement of the relative cost of lime and oxide. I am not aware that  either the Hawkins method or the Cooper coal liming process has yet  received a trial from any Scotch gas engineer.      BURNERS AND REGENERATIVE LAMPS.    But even after we have been able to produce and send out gas of the  greatest purity, our troubles are frequently only beginning, as, very  often, consumers do not use, but simply waste and destroy the gas by bad  burners and fittings. Nothing, however, will convince them that they are  in any way to blame for the light being poor. I am certainly of opinion  that gas companies would do the public a service in supplying them with  suitable burners for the quality of gas that is being sent out for  consumption. I have myself for some years adopted this policy, and  almost invariably find that complaints cease and consumers are pleased  with the results.    We have now also so large a number of really good regenerative lamps  which give excellent results, and can be made in a great variety of very  neat and ornamental designs, that we ought to endeavor to the utmost of  our power to introduce them to the public, and, if possible, induce them  to use them not only in halls and similar places, but in their dwelling  houses, as with these lamps a most thorough and efficient system of  ventilation can be carried out, by which the heat that is so much  complained of in gas-lighted apartments is reduced to a minimum, and the  atmosphere of such apartments is rendered healthy and agreeable.    With such improved lamps at our command, I think we have nothing to fear  from the competition of the electric light, which during the past year  has not made any very startling advance--generally attributed by  electricians to the restrictive legislation under which they have been  placed. Let us hope this is now about to be removed. I am sure we all  rejoice that such is the case, as all we want is a \"fair field and no  favor.\" We can with confidence await the result.      THE WELSBACH GAS LIGHT.    In the mean time, however, while electricity for lighting purposes has,  to say the least, not made any startling advances, we have, besides the  regenerative lamps before mentioned, the new Welsbach light, which is  exhibited before you to-day, by the kindness of Dr. Wallace; and if the  results said to be obtained by it are at all what they are represented  to be, we certainly have a new departure in gas lighting of no mean  order. Dr. Wallace--a gentleman who is well known to us as one well  qualified to test its merits--has found that the Welsbach burner  produces a light equal to more than 9 candles per cubic foot of gas of  25 candle power, thus nearly doubling the amount of light compared with  gas consumed in the ordinary way.    The construction and manufacture of the burner I have seen described in  these terms: Chemists have been diligently working for many years on the  problem of how to convert into light the highly condensed heat of the  Bunsen burner; and a Vienna chemist now claims to have solved it.    The first condition of the problem was to find a medium on which the  heat could be perfectly concentrated and raised to illuminating power.  Many experiments have been made with platinum in a Bunsen flame, and a  brilliant enough light has been produced, but at a cost altogether  outside commercial use. The Vienna chemist, Dr. Welsbach, has discovered  a composition which is as good a non-conductor--that is to say  concentrator--of heat as platinum, is much more durable, and a great  deal cheaper. The base of it is a peculiar clay, found in Ceylon, which  combines the indestructibility of asbestos with the non-conducting  property of platinum; and having found the incandescent medium, he has  next adapted it to the Bunsen burner.    In this arrangement there is the simplicity of genius. He gets a fine  cotton fabric woven into the shape of a cylinder, with a tapering point.  In its first stage it is about 2 inches in diameter; and after being  coated with the composition, it is subjected to a strong heat. This has  two effects--first, the cotton fiber is completely burned out, while the  composition retains the shape of the woven surface on which it was  moulded. Then the cylinder contracts and solidifies until it becomes  about the size of the forefinger of a glove. Dr. Welsbach calls this his  \"mantle;\" and by a simple arrangement he fits it on a Bunsen burner, and  places an ordinary lamp chimney over it. When the flame is applied, the  \"mantle\" becomes incandescent, and gives out a brilliant yellow light,  which, it may be said without exaggeration, will compare favorably with  any electric light yet put on the market.    For decorative effect a pretty frosted globe is used; and by varying the  globe a pure white or a pure yellow may be obtained. It is also added  that there is no act of Parliament required for it, nor even a  provisional order of the Board of Trade. No streets have to be broken up  in order to lay down pipes; and no wires have to be hung across the  roofs of protesting householders.    The whole apparatus can be got ready to fit on an ordinary gas bracket;  and"]]]
