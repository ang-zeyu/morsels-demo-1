Then Topsy would be taken away and sold, in spite of anything I could  say.'    Mr. St. Clare hated being made to do things when he didn't want to.  However, after teasing his cousin a little more, he wrote out the paper,  and Topsy belonged to Miss Ophelia. That evening Mr. St. Clare went out  for a ride.    Tom saw him go, and asked if he should come too. 'No, my boy,' said Mr.  St. Clare, 'I shall be back in an hour.'    Tom sat down on the verandah to wait till his master came home. While he  waited, he fell asleep.    Presently he was awakened by loud knocking, and the sound of voices at  the gate.    He ran to open it.    Several men were there carrying a load. It was Mr. St. Clare. He had  been hurt in an accident, and was dying.    Very gently they laid him on a sofa. Nothing could be done. In a short  time he had gone to join his little Eva.          CHAPTER XVII      UNCLE TOM'S NEW MASTER      There had been great grief in the house when Eva died. Now there was not  only sorrow, but gloom and fear.    The kind master was dead, and the poor slaves asked themselves in  despair what would happen to them now.    They were not long left in doubt. One morning Mrs. St. Clare told them  that they were all to be sold. She was going back to her father's house  to live, and would not want them any more.    Poor Uncle Tom! The news was a dreadful blow to him. For a few days he  had been so happy in the thought of going home. Once more, after all  these years, he thought he would see his dear wife and little children.  Now, at one stroke, he had lost both his kind master and his hope of  freedom.    Instead of going home, he was to be sent farther away than ever from his  dear ones. He could not bear it. He tried to say, \"Thy will be done\",  but bitter tears almost choked the words.    He had one hope left. He would ask Miss Ophelia to speak to Mrs. St.  Clare for him.    'Mas'r St. Clare promised me my freedom, Miss Feely,' he said. 'He told  me that he had begun to take it out for me. And now, perhaps, if you  would be good enough to speak about it to missis, she would feel like  going on with it. Seeing it was Mas'r St. Clare's wish, she might.'    'I'll speak for you, Tom, and do my best,' said Miss Ophelia. 'I haven't  much hope, but I will try.'    So Miss Ophelia asked Mrs. St. Clare to set Tom free.    'Indeed, I shall do no such thing,' she replied. 'Tom is worth more than  any of the other slaves. I couldn't afford to lose so much money.  Besides, what does he want with his freedom? He is a great deal better  off as he is.'    'But he does want it very much,' replied Miss Ophelia. 'And his master  promised it to him.'    'I dare say he does want it,' replied Mrs. St. Clare. 'They all want it.  Just because they are a discontented set, always wanting what they  haven't got.'    'But Tom is so good and gentle, and such a splendid worker. If you sell  him there is the chance of his getting a bad master.'    'Oh, I have no fear about that. Most masters are good, in spite of all  the talk people make about it,' replied Mrs. St. Clare.    'Well', said Miss Ophelia at last, 'I know it was one of the last wishes  of your husband that Tom should have his freedom. He promised dear  little Eva that he should have it. I think you ought to do it.'    Then Mrs. St. Clare began to cry, and say every one was unkind to her,  and Miss Ophelia saw it was no use saying anything more. There was only  one other thing she could do. She wrote to Mrs. Shelby, telling her that  poor Uncle Tom was going to be sold again. She asked her to send money  to buy him back, as soon as possible.    The next day, Uncle Tom and the other slaves belonging to Mr. St. Clare  were sent to market to be sold.    As Uncle Tom stood in the market-place, waiting for some one to buy him,  he looked anxiously round. In the crowd of faces, he was trying to find  one kind, handsome one, like Mr. St. Clare's. But there was none.    Presently a short, broad man, with a coarse, ugly face and dirty hands,  came up to Tom. He looked him all over, pulled his mouth open and looked  at his teeth, pinched his arms, made him walk and jump, and indeed  treated him as he would a horse or cow he had wished to buy.    Tom knew from the way this man looked and spoke, that he must be bad and  cruel. He prayed in his heart that this might not be his new master. But  it was. His name was Legree. He bought Uncle Tom, several other men  slaves, and two women. One of the women was a pretty young girl, who had  never been away from her mother before, and who was very much afraid of  her new master. The other was an old woman. The two women were chained  together. The men, Uncle Tom among them, had heavy chains put on both  hands and feet. Then Legree drove them all on to a boat which was going  up the river to his plantation.    It was a sad journey. This time there was no pretty Eva, nor  kind-hearted Mr. St. Clare, to bring any happiness to the poor slaves.    One of the first things Legree did was to take away all Tom's nice  clothes which Mr. St. Clare had given him.    He made him put on his oldest clothes, then he sold all the others to  the sailors.    Legree made his slaves unhappy in every way he could think of. Then he  would come up to them and say, 'Come, come, I don't allow any sulky  looks. Be cheerful, now, or--' and he would crack his whip in a way to  make them tremble.    At last the weary journey was over. Legree and his slaves landed. His  house was a long way from the river. The men slaves walked, while Legree  and the two women drove in a cart.    Mile after mile they trudged along, over the rough road through wild and  dreary country, till, hungry, thirsty, and tired, they arrived at the  farm, or plantation as it was called.    Legree was not a gentleman like Mr. Shelby or Mr. St. Clare. He was a  very rough kind of farmer. On his farm he grew cotton. The cotton had to  be gathered and tied into bundles. Then he sold it to people who made it  into calico, muslin, and other things, which we need to use and wear.  Gathering cotton is very hard work.    The house Legree lived in had once been a very fine one, and had  belonged to a rich gentleman. Now, it was old, neglected, and almost in  ruins.    The house was bad enough, but the cabins where the slaves lived were far  worse. They were roughly built of wood. The wind and the rain came  through the chinks between the planks. There were no windows. The floors  were nothing but the bare earth. There was no furniture of any kind in  them, only heaps of dirty straw to sleep upon.    Uncle Tom felt more unhappy than ever. He had hoped at least to have a  little room which he could keep clean and tidy. But this hole he did not  even have to himself. He had to share it with five or six others.    Now began the saddest time of Uncle Tom's life. Every morning very early  the slaves were driven out into the fields like cattle. All day long  they worked hard. The burning sun blazed down upon them, making them hot  and tired. Legree and his two chief slaves, called Quimbo and Sambo,  marched about all the time with whips in their hands. At night they  drove the slaves back again to their miserable huts.    But before they could rest, they had to grind and cook the corn for  their supper. When at last they did go to sleep, they had to lie on the  heaps of dirty straw instead of in comfortable beds.          CHAPTER XVIII      GEORGE AND ELIZA FIND FREEDOM      Tom Loker lay tossing and tumbling in his clean, comfortable bed at the  Quaker farmhouse. A pretty, old Quaker lady, with white hair and a kind  face, was nursing him. Tom Loker did not like being ill and having to  lie in bed. He threw the clothes about, grumbling and using naughty  words all the tune.    'I must ask thee, Thomas Loker, not to use such language,' said the nice  lady, as she smoothed his sheets, and made his bed comfortable again for  him.    'Well, I won't, granny, if I can help it,' he replied; 'but it is enough  to make a fellow swear, it is so awfully hot.' He gave another great  lunge, and made the sheets and blankets all untidy again.    'I suppose that fellow George and the girl Eliza are here,' he said, in  a sulky voice, after a few minutes' silence.    'Yes, they are,' said the old lady.    'They had better get away across the lake,' said Tom Loker, 'the quicker  the better.'    'Very likely they will do so,' said the old lady, calmly going on with  her knitting.    'But, listen,' said Tom Loker, getting excited, 'there are people who  are watching the boats for us. I don't care if I tell now. I hope they  will get away, just to spite the others for going and leaving me as they  did--the mean puppies, the--'    'Thomas Loker!' said the old lady.    'I tell you, granny, if you bottle a fellow up too tight he'll split,'  said Tom Loker. 'But about Eliza--tell them to dress her up some way so  as to alter her. We have sent a description of what she looks like to  the town where the boats start from. She will be caught yet if she  doesn't dress up differently.'    'I thank thee, Thomas Loker,' replied the old lady with her usual  calmness. 'We will attend to that. Thank thee.' Then she went to tell  George and Eliza what Tom Loker had said.    They were indeed very grateful to him, and very glad that they had not  left him, as his own friends had done, to die by the roadside.    So next day Eliza cut off all her beautiful black hair, and dressed  herself like a boy.    'Don't I make a pretty young fellow?' she said to George, laughing and  blushing at the same time.    'You always will be pretty,' said George gravely, 'do what you will.'    'What makes you so sober?' asked Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying  her hand on his. 'We are within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say.  Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!'    'O Eliza,' said George, holding her fast, 'that is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#8)"],[1,"s, in the words of the prophet: \"He who  picks up the crumbs fallen from the table and eats them, will be  forgiven by God.\" \"He who licks the empty dishes and his fingers will  be filled by God here and in the world to come.\" \"When a man licks the  dish from which he has eaten, the dish will plead for him before God.\"  I regard these words as practical applications of the text, \"Gather up  the pieces that remain, that nothing be lost\" (Matt. xiv. 10: John vi.  12). Even to-day South Italians kiss bread that has fallen to the  ground, in order to make apology to the gift of God. Volumes might be  filled with rules of polite manners in this style: hardly any detail  is to be found in the whole business of daily life, even including  occupations regarded as unclean, which was not invested with some  religious significance. These rules are almost entirely dictated by  the spirit of early Christianity and it is possible to reconstruct the  details of life in those dark ages from these literary records which  are now the only source of evidence upon such points. However, we must  here content ourselves with establishing the fact that Islam adopted  Christian practice in this as in other departments of life.    The state, society, the individual, economics and morality were thus  collectively under Christian influence during the early period of  Muhammedanism. Conditions very similar in general, affected those  conceptions which we explain upon scientific grounds but which were  invariably regarded by ancient and mediaeval thought as supernatural,  conceptions deduced from the phenomena of illness and dreams. Islam  was no less opposed than Christianity to the practice of magic in any  form, but only so far as these practices seemed to preserve remnants  of heathen beliefs. Such beliefs were, however, continued in both  religions in modified form. There is no doubt that ideas of high  antiquity, doubtless of Babylonian origin, can be traced as  contributing to the formation of these beliefs, while scientific  medicine is connected with the earlier discoveries of Greece. Common  to both religions was the belief in the reality of dreams, especially  when these seemed to harmonise with religious ideas: dreams were  regarded as revelations from God or from his apostles or from the  pious dead. The fact that man could dream and that he could appear to  other men in dreams after his death was regarded as a sign of divine  favour and the biographies of the saints often contain chapters  devoted to this faculty. These are natural ideas which lie in the  national consciousness of any people, but owe their development in the  case of Islam to Christian influence. The same may be said of the  belief that the prayers of particular saints were of special efficacy,  and of attempts by prayer, forms of worship and the like to procure  rain, avert plague and so forth: such ideas are common throughout the  middle ages. Thus in every department we meet with that particular  type of Christian theory which existed in the East during the seventh  and eighth centuries.    This mediaeval theory of life was subjected, as is well known, to many  compromises in the West, and was materially modified by Teutonic  influence and the revival of classicism. It might therefore be  supposed that in Islam Christian theory underwent similar modification  or disappeared entirely. But the fact is not so. At the outset, we  stated, as will be remembered, that Muhammedan scholars were  accustomed to propound their dicta as utterances given by Muhammed  himself, and in this form Christian ideas also came into circulation  among Muhammedans. When attempts were made to systematise these  sayings, all were treated as alike authentic, and, as traditional,  exerted their share of influence upon the formation of canon law. Thus  questions of temporary importance to mediaeval Christianity became  permanent elements in Muhammedan theology.    One highly instructive instance may be given. During the century which  preceded the Byzantine iconoclastic controversy, the whole of nearer  Asia was disturbed by the question whether the erection and veneration  of images was permissible. That Constantinople attempted to prohibit  such veneration is well known: but after a long struggle the church  gained its wishes. Islam was confronted with the problem and decided  for prohibition, doubtless under Jewish influence. Sayings of Muhammed  forbid the erection of images. This prohibition became part of canon  law and therefore binding for all time: it remains obligatory at the  present day, though in practice it is often transgressed. Thus the  process of development which was continued in Christendom, came to a  standstill in Islam, and many similar cases might be quoted.    Here begins the development of Muhammedan jurisprudence or, more  exactly, of the doctrine of duty, which includes every kind of human  activity, duties to God and man, religion, civil law, the penal code,  social morality and economics. This extraordinary system of moral  obligations, as developed in Islam, though its origin is obscure, is  doubtless rooted in the ecclesiastical law of Christendom which was  then first evolved. I have no doubt that the development of Muhammedan  tradition, which precedes the code proper, was dependent upon the  growth of canon law in the old Church, and that this again, or at  least the purely legal part of it, is closely connected with the  pre-Justinian legislation. Roman law does not seem to me to have  influenced Islam immediately in the form of Justinian's _Corpus  Juris_, but indirectly from such ecclesiastical sources as the  Romano-Syrian code. This view, however, I would distinctly state, is  merely my conjecture. For our present purpose it is more important to  establish the fact that the doctrine of duty canonised the manifold  expressions of the theory that life is a religion, with which we have  met throughout the traditional literature: all human acts are thus  legally considered as obligatory or forbidden when corresponding with  religious commands or prohibitions, as congenial or obnoxious to the  law or as matters legally indifferent and therefore permissible. The  arrangement of the work of daily life in correspondence with these  religious points of view is the most important outcome of the  Muhammedan doctrine of duties. The religious utterances which also  cover the whole business of life were first made duties by this  doctrine: in practice their fulfilment is impossible, but the theory  of their obligatory nature is a fundamental element in Muhammedanism.    Where the doctrine of duties deals with legal rights, its application  was in practice confined to marriage and the affairs of family life:  the theoretical demands of its penal clauses, for instance, raise  impossible difficulties. At the same time, it has been of great  importance to the whole spiritual life of Islam down to the present  day, because it reflects Muhammedan ideals of life and of man's place  in the world. Even to-day it remains the daily bread of the soul that  desires instruction, to quote the words of the greatest father of the  Muhammedan church. It will thus be immediately obvious to what a vast  extent Christian theory of the seventh and eighth centuries still  remains operative upon Muhammedan thought throughout the world.    Considerable parts of the doctrine of duties are concerned with the  forms of Muhammedan worship. It is becoming ever clearer that only  slight tendencies to a form of worship were apparent under Muhammed.  The mosque, the building erected for the special purpose of divine  service, was unknown during the prophet's lifetime; nor was there any  definite church organisation, of which the most important parts are  the common ritual and the preaching. Tendencies existed but no system,  was to be found: there was no clerical class to take an interest in  the development of an order of divine service. The Caliphs prayed  before the faithful in the capital, as did the governors in the  provinces. The military commanders also led a simple service in their  own stations.    It was contact with foreign influence which first provided the impulse  to a systematic form of worship. Both Christians and Jews possessed  such forms. Their example was followed and a ritual was evolved, at  first of the very simplest kind. No detailed organisation, however,  was attempted, until Christian influence led to the formation of the  class which naturally took an interest in the matter, the professional  theologians. These soon replaced the military service leaders. This  change denoted the final stage in the development of ritual. The  object of the theologians was to subject the various occupations of  life to ritual as well as to religion. The mediatorial or sacramental  theories of the priestly office were unknown to Islam, but ritual  customs of similar character were gradually evolved, and are  especially pronounced in the ceremonies of marriage and burial.    More important, however, was the development of the official service,  the arrangement of the day and the hour of obligatory attendance and  the introduction of preaching: under Muhammed and his early followers,  and until late in the Omajjad period, preaching was confined to  addresses, given as occasion demanded, but by degrees it became part  of the regular ritual. With it was afterwards connected the  intercession for the Caliphs, which became a highly significant part  of the service, as symbolising their sovereignty. It seems to me very  probable that this practice was an adoption, at any rate in theory, of  the Christian custom of praying for the emperor. The pulpit was then  introduced under Christian influence, which thus completely  transformed the chair (_mimbar_) of the ancient Arab judges and rulers  and made it a piece of church furniture; the Christian _cancelli_ or  choir screens were adopted and "]]]
