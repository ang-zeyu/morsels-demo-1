[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#8)"],[1," in Connecticut, illustrious or  commonplace--as are many of their descendants whose names are written on  the rolls of the patriotic societies in these days of ancestral  discovery and exploitation--were absolute believers in the powers of  Satan and his machinations through witchcraft and the evidence then  adduced to prove them, and trained to such credulity by their education  and experience, by their theological doctrines, and by the law of the  land in Old England, but still clothed upon with that righteousness  which as it proved in the end made them skeptical as to certain alleged  evidences of guilt, and swift to respond to the calls of reason and of  mercy when the appeals were made to their calm judgment and second  thought as to the sins of their fellowmen.    In no way can the truth be so clearly set forth, the real character of  the evidence be so justly appreciated upon which the convictions were  had, as from the depositions and the oral testimony of the witnesses  themselves. They are lasting memorials to the credulity and  superstition, and the religious insanity which clouded the senses of the  wisest men for a time, and to the malevolence and satanic ingenuity of  the people who, possessed of the devil accused their friends and  neighbors of a crime punishable by death.    Nor is this dark chapter in colonial history without its flashes of  humor and ridiculousness, as one follows the absurd and unbridled  testimonies which have been chosen as completely illustrative of the  whole series in the years of the witchcraft nightmare. They are in part  cited here, for the sake of authenticity and exactness, as written out  in the various court records and depositions, published and unpublished,  in the ancient style of spelling, and are worthy the closest study for  many reasons.    It will, however, clear the way to a better understanding of the unique  testimonies of the witch witnesses, if there be first presented the  authoritative reasons for the examination of a witch, coupled with a  summary of the lawful tests of innocence or guilt. They are in the  handwriting of William Jones, a Deputy Governor of Connecticut and a  member of the court at some of the trials.    GROUNDS FOR EXAMINATION OF A WITCH    \"1. Notorious defamacon by ye common report of the people a ground of  suspicion.    \"2. Second ground for strict examinacon is if a fellow witch gave  testimony on his examinacon or death yt such a pson is a witch, but this  is not sufficient for conviccon or condemnacon.    \"3. If after cursing, there follow death or at least mischiefe to ye  party.    \"4. If after quarrelling or threatening a prsent mischiefe doth follow  for ptye's devilishly disposed after cursing doe use threatnings, & yt  alsoe is a grt prsumcon agt y.    \"5. If ye pty suspected be ye son or daughter, the serv't or familiar  friend, neer neighbors or old companion of a knowne or convicted witch  this alsoe is a prsumcon, for witchcraft is an art yt may be larned &  covayd from man to man & oft it falleth out yt a witch dying leaveth som  of ye aforesd heires of her witchcraft.    \"6. If ye pty suspected have ye devills mark for t'is thought wn ye  devill maketh his covent with y he alwayess leaves his mark behind him  to know y for his owne yt is, if noe evident reason in      can be given  for such mark.    \"7. Lastly if ye pty examined be unconstant & contrary to himselfe in  his answers.    \"Thus much for examinacon wch usually is by Q. & some tymes by torture  upon strong & grt presumcon.    \"For conviccon it must be grounded on just and sufficient proofes. The  proofes for conviccon of 2 sorts, 1, Some be less sufficient, some more  sufficient.    \"Less sufficient used in formr ages by red hot iron and scalding water.  ye pty to put in his hand in one or take up ye othr, if not hurt ye pty  cleered, if hurt convicted for a witch, but this was utterly condemned.  In som countryes anothr proofe justified by some of ye learned by  casting ye pty bound into water, if she sanck counted inocent, if she  sunk not yn guilty, but all those tryalls the author counts supstitious  and unwarrantable and worse. Although casting into ye water is by some  justified for ye witch having made a ct wth ye devill she hath renounced  her baptm & hence ye antipathy between her & water, but this he makes  nothing off. Anothr insufficient testimoy of a witch is ye testimony of  a wizard, who prtends to show ye face of ye witch to ye party afflicted  in a glass, but this he counts diabolicall & dangerous, ye devill may  reprsent a pson inocent. Nay if after curses & threats mischiefe follow  or if a sick pson like to dy take it on his death such a one has  bewitched him, there are strong grounds of suspicon for strict examinacon  but not sufficient for conviccon.    \"But ye truer proofes sufficient for conviccon are ye voluntary  confession of ye pty suspected adjudged sufficient proofe by both  divines & lawyers. Or 2 the testimony of 2 witnesses of good and honest  report avouching things in theire knowledge before ye magistrat 1 wither  yt ye party accused hath made a league wth ye devill or 2d or hath ben  some knowne practices of witchcraft. Argumts to prove either must be as 1  if they can pve ye pty hath invocated ye devill for his help this pt  of yt ye devill binds withes to.    \"Or 2 if ye pty hath entertained a familiar spt in any forme mouse cat  or othr visible creature.    \"Or 3 if they affirm upon oath ye pty hath done any accon or work wch  inferreth a ct wth ye devill, as to shew ye face of a man in a glass, or  used inchantmts or such feates, divineing of things to come, raising  tempests, or causing ye forme of a dead man to appeare or ye like it  sufficiently pves a witch.    \"But altho those are difficult things to prove yet yr are wayes to come  to ye knowledg of y, for tis usuall wth Satan to pmise anything till ye  league be ratified, & then he     nothing     ye discovery of y, for wtever  witches intend the devill intends nothing but theire utter confusion,  therefore in ye just judgmt of God it soe oft falls out yt some witches  shall by confession discour ys, or by true testimonies be convicted.    \"And ye reasons why ye devill would discover y is 1 his malice towards  all men 2 his insatiable desire to have ye witches not sure enough of y  till yn.    \"And ye authors warne jurors, &c not to condemne suspected psons on bare  prsumtions wthout good & sufficient proofes.    \"But if convicted of yt horrid crime to be put to death, for God hath  said thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\"    The accuser and the prosecutor were aided in their work in a peculiar  way. It was the theory and belief that every witch was marked--very  privately marked--by the Devil, and the marks could only be discovered  by a personal examination. And thus there came into the service of the  courts a servant known as a \"searcher,\" usually a woman, as most of the  unfortunates who were accused were women.    The location and identification of the witch marks involved revolting  details, some of the reports being unprintable. It is, however,  indispensable to a right understanding of the delusion and the popular  opinions which made it possible, that these incidents, abhorrent and  nauseating as they are, be given within proper limitations to meet  inquiry--not curiosity--and because they may be noted in various  records.    A standard authority in legal procedure in England, recognized in  witchcraft prosecutions in the New England colonies, was _Dalton's  Country Justice_, first published in 1619 in England, and in its last  edition in 1746.    In its chapter on Witchcraft are these directions as to the witch marks:    \"These witches have ordinarily a familiar, or spirit which appeareth to  them, sometimes in one shape and sometimes in another; as in the shape  of a man, woman, boy, dog, cat, foal, hare, rat, toad, etc. And to these  their spirits, they give names, and they meet together to christen them  (as they speak).... And besides their sucking the Devil leaveth other  marks upon their body, sometimes like a blue or red spot, like a  flea-biting, sometimes the flesh sunk in and hollow. And these Devil's  marks be insensible, and being pricked will not bleed, and be often in  their secretest parts, and therefore require diligent and careful  search. These first two are main points to discover and convict those  witches.\"    These methods were adopted in the proceedings against witches in  Connecticut, and it will suffice to cite one of the reports of a  committee--Sarah Burr, Abigail Burr, Abigail Howard, Sarah Wakeman, and  Hannah Wilson,--\"apointed (by the court) to make sarch upon ye bodis of  Marcy Disbrough and Goodwif Clauson,\" at Fairfield, in September and  October 1692, sworn to before Jonathan Bell, Commissioner, and John  Allyn, Secretary.    \"Wee Sarah bur and abigall bur and Abigail howard and Sarah wakman all  of fayrfeild with hanna wilson being by order of authority apointed to  make sarch upon ye bodis of marcy disbrough and goodwif Clauson to see  what they Could find on ye bodies of ether & both of them; and wee retor  as followeth and doe testify as to goodwif Clauson forementioned wee  found on her secret parts Just within ye lips of ye same growing within  sid sumewhat as broad and reach without ye lips of ye same about on Inch  and half long lik in shape to a dogs eare which wee apprehend to be  vnvsuall to women.    \"and as to marcy wee find on marcy foresayd on her secret parts growing  within ye lep of ye same a los pees of skin and when puld it is near an  Inch long somewhat in form of ye fingar of a glove flatted    \"that lose skin wee Judge more than common to women.\"    \"Octob. 29 1692 The above sworn by the above-named as attests    \"JOHN ALLYN Secry\"          CHAPTER VI    \"Remembering all this, it is not surprising that witches were tried,  convicted and put to death in New England; and the manner "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#8)"],[1,"Cookery.

The writer of the \"French Gardener,\" of which I have had occasion to  say a good deal in my small volume on that subject, also produced,  \"Les Delices de la Campagne,\" which Evelyn excused himself from  translating because, whatever experience he had in the garden, he had  none, he says, in the shambles; and it was for those who affected  such matters to get it done, but not by him who did the \"French Cook\"  [Footnote: I have not seen this book, nor is it under that title  in the catalogue of the British Museum]. He seems to imply that the  latter, though an excellent work in its way, had not only been marred  in the translation, but was not so practically advantageous to us  as it might have been, \"for want of skill in the kitchen\"--in  other words, an evil, which still prevails, was then appreciated  by intelligent observers--the English cook did not understand her  business, and the English mistress, as a rule, was equally ignorant.    One of the engravings in the \"French Gardener\" represents women  rolling out paste, preparing vegetables, and boiling conserves.    There is a rather quaint and attractive class of miscellaneous  receipt-books, not made so on account of any particular merit in  their contents, but by reason of their association with some person  of quality. MS. Sloane 1367, is a narrow octavo volume, for instance,  containing \"My Lady Rennelagh's choice Receipts: as also some of Capt.  Gvilt's, who valued them above gold.\" The value for us, however, is  solely in the link with a noble family and the little touch about the  Captain. There are many more such in public and private libraries, and  they are often mere transcripts from printed works--select assemblages  of directions for dressing food and curing diseases, formed for  domestic reference before the advent of Dr. Buchan, and Mrs. Glasse,  and Mrs. Rundell.    Among a valuable and extensive assemblage of English and foreign  cookery books in the Patent Office Library, Mr. Ordish has obligingly  pointed out to me a curious 4to MS., on the cover of which occurs,  \"Mrs. Mary Dacres her booke, 1666.\"    Even in the latter part of the seventeenth century the old-fashioned  dishes, better suited to the country than to the Court taste, remained  in fashion, and are included in receipt-books, even in that published  by Joseph Cooper, who had been head-cook to Charles I, and who styles  his 1654 volume \"The Art of Cookery Refined and Augmented.\" He gives  us two varieties of oatmeal pudding, French barley pudding, and hasty  pudding in a bag. There is a direction for frying mushrooms, which  were growing more into favour at the table than in the days when  Castelvetri, whom I cite in my monograph on Gardening, was among us.  Another dainty is an ox-palate pie.    Cooper's Preface is quaint, and surely modest enough. \"Though the  cheats,\" says he, \"of some preceding pieces that treated on this  subject (whose Title-pages, like the contents of a weekly Pamphlet,  promised much more than the Books performed) may have provided this  but a cold intertainment at its first coming abroad; yet I know it  will not stay long in the world, before every rational reader will  clear it of all alliance to those false pretenders. Ladies, forgive  my confidence, if I tell you, that I know this piece will prove your  favourite.\"    Yet Cooper's performance, in spite of its droll, self-complacent vein  in the address to the Reader, is a judicious and useful selection,  and was, in fact, far more serviceable to the middle-class gentry  than some of those which had gone before. It adapted itself to sundry  conditions of men; but it kept in view those whose purses were not  richly lined enough to pay for dainties and \"subtleties.\" It is  pleasant to see that, after the countless centuries which had run  out since Arthur, the bag-pudding and hot-pot maintained their  ground--good, wholesome, country fare.    After the fall of the Monarchy in 1648, the _chef de cuisine_ probably  found his occupation gone, like a greater man before him; and the  world may owe to enforced repose this condescension to the pen by the  deposed minister of a king.    Soon after the Restoration it was that some Royalist brought out a  small volume called \"The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth, commonly  called Joan Cromwell, the wife of the late Usurper, truly described  and represented,\" 12mo, 1664. Its design was to throw ridicule on the  parsimony of the Protectoral household. But he recites some excellent  dishes which made their appearance at Oliver's table: Dutch puddings,  Scotch collops of veal, marrow puddings, sack posset, boiled  woodcocks, and warden pies. He seems to have understood that eight  stone of beef were cooked every morning for the establishment, and all  scraps were diligently collected, and given alternately to the poor  of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. The  writer acquaints us that, when the Protector entertained the French  ambassador and the Parliament, after the Sindercome affair, he only  spent L1,000 over the banquet, of which the Lady Protectress managed  to save L200. Cromwell and his wife, we are told, did not care for  suppers, but contented themselves with eggs and slops.    A story is told here of Cromwell and his wife sitting down to a  loin of veal, and his calling for an orange, which was the sauce he  preferred to that joint, and her highness telling him that he could  not have one, for they were not to be had under a groat.    The Mansion House still retains the ancient usage of distributing the  relics of a great feast afterwards among the poor, as Cromwell is said  just above to have made a rule of his household. It was a practice  highly essential in the absence of any organised system of relief.    The reign of Charles II., which witnessed a relationship with France  of a very different character from that which the English maintained  during the Plantagenet and earlier Tudor rule, was favourable to the  naturalisation of the Parisian school of cookery, and numerous works  were published at and about that time, in which the development of  knowledge in this direction is shown to have taken place _pari passu_  with the advance in gardening and arboriculture under the auspices of  Evelyn.    In 1683 we come to a little volume entitled \"The Young Cook's  Monitor,\" by M.H., who made it public for the benefit of his (or her)  scholars; a really valuable and comprehensive manual, wherein, without  any attempt at arrangement, there is an ample assemblage of directions  for preparing for the table all kinds of joints, made dishes, soups  and broths, _frigacies_, puddings, pies, tarts, tansies, and jellies.  Receipts for pickling are included, and two ways are shown how we  should treat turnips after this wise. Some of the ingredients  proposed for sauces seem to our ears rather prodigious. In one place  a contemporary peruser has inserted an ironical calculation in MS. to  the effect that, whereas a cod's head could be bought for fourpence,  the condiments recommended for it were not to be had for less than  nine shillings. The book teaches us to make Scotch collops, to pickle  lemons and quinces, to make French bread, to collar beef, pork, or  eels, to make gooseberry fool, to dry beef after the Dutch fashion, to  make sack posset two ways, to candy flowers (violets, roses, etc.) for  salads, to pickle walnuts like mangoes, to make flummery, to make a  carp pie, to pickle French beans and cucumbers, to make damson and  quince wines, to make a French pudding (called a Pomeroy pudding), to  make a leg of pork like a Westphalia ham, to make mutton as beef, and  to pot beef to eat like venison.    These and many other precepts has M.H. left behind him; and a sort of  companion volume, printed a little before, goes mainly over the same  ground, to wit, \"Rare and Excellent Receipts Experienced and Taught  by Mrs. Mary Tillinghast, and now printed for"]]]
