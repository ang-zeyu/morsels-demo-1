No! those exquisite Parisians were never intended to rest in Mr.  Shipman's safe until the morning. That last bottle of '48 port, with the  aid of a powerful soporific, ensured that Mr. Shipman would sleep  undisturbed during the night.    \"Ah! remember all the details, they were so admirable! the letter posted  in Brighton by the cunning rogue to himself, the smashed desk, the  broken pane of glass in his own house. The man Robertson on the watch,  while Knopf himself in ragged clothing found his way into No. 26. If  Constable D 21 had not appeared upon the scene that exciting comedy in  the early morning would not have been enacted. As it was, in the  supposed fight, Mr. Shipman's diamonds passed from the hands of the  tramp into those of his accomplice.    \"Then, later on, Robertson, ill in bed, while his master was supposed to  have returned--by the way, it never struck anybody that no one saw Mr.  Knopf come home, though he surely would have driven up in a cab. Then  the double part played by one man for the next two days. It certainly  never struck either the police or the inspector. Remember they only saw  Robertson when in bed with a streaming cold. But Knopf had to be got out  of gaol as soon as possible; the dual _role_ could not have been kept up  for long. Hence the story of the diamonds found in the garden of No. 22.  The cunning rogues guessed that the usual plan would be acted upon, and  the suspected thief allowed to visit the scene where his hoard lay  hidden.    \"It had all been foreseen, and Robertson must have been constantly on  the watch. The tramp stopped, mind you, in Phillimore Terrace for some  moments, lighting a pipe. The accomplice, then, was fully on the alert;  he slipped the bolts of the back garden gate. Five minutes later Knopf  was in the house, in a hot bath, getting rid of the disguise of our  friend the tramp. Remember that again here the detective did not  actually see him.    \"The next morning Mr. Knopf, black hair and beard and all, was himself  again. The whole trick lay in one simple art, which those two cunning  rascals knew to absolute perfection, the art of impersonating one  another.    \"They are brothers, presumably--twin brothers, I should say.\"    \"But Mr. Knopf--\" suggested Polly.    \"Well, look in the Trades' Directory; you will see F. Knopf & Co.,  diamond merchants, of some City address. Ask about the firm among the  trade; you will hear that it is firmly established on a sound financial  basis. He! he! he! and it deserves to be,\" added the man in the corner,  as, calling for the waitress, he received his ticket, and taking up his  shabby hat, took himself and his bit of string rapidly out of the room.          CHAPTER VII    THE YORK MYSTERY      The man in the corner looked quite cheerful that morning; he had had two  glasses of milk and had even gone to the extravagance of an extra  cheese-cake. Polly knew that he was itching to talk police and murders,  for he cast furtive glances at her from time to time, produced a bit of  string, tied and untied it into scores of complicated knots, and  finally, bringing out his pocket-book, he placed two or three  photographs before her.    \"Do you know who that is?\" he asked, pointing to one of these.    The girl looked at the face on the picture. It was that of a woman, not  exactly pretty, but very gentle and childlike, with a strange pathetic  look in the large eyes which was wonderfully appealing.    \"That was Lady Arthur Skelmerton,\" he said, and in a flash there flitted  before Polly's mind the weird and tragic history which had broken this  loving woman's heart. Lady Arthur Skelmerton! That name recalled one of  the most bewildering, most mysterious passages in the annals of  undiscovered crimes.    \"Yes. It was sad, wasn't it?\" he commented, in answer to Polly's  thoughts. \"Another case which but for idiotic blunders on the part of  the police must have stood clear as daylight before the public and  satisfied general anxiety. Would you object to my recapitulating its  preliminary details?\"    She said nothing, so he continued without waiting further for a reply.    \"It all occurred during the York racing week, a time which brings to the  quiet cathedral city its quota of shady characters, who congregate  wherever money and wits happen to fly away from their owners. Lord  Arthur Skelmerton, a very well-known figure in London society and in  racing circles, had rented one of the fine houses which overlook the  racecourse. He had entered Peppercorn, by St. Armand--Notre Dame, for  the Great Ebor Handicap. Peppercorn was the winner of the Newmarket, and  his chances for the Ebor were considered a practical certainty.    \"If you have ever been to York you will have noticed the fine houses  which have their drive and front entrances in the road called 'The  Mount.' and the gardens of which extend as far as the racecourse,  commanding a lovely view over the entire track. It was one of these  houses, called 'The Elms,' which Lord Arthur Skelmerton had rented for  the summer.    \"Lady Arthur came down some little time before the racing week with her  servants--she had no children; but she had many relatives and friends in  York, since she was the daughter of old Sir John Etty, the cocoa  manufacturer, a rigid Quaker, who, it was generally said, kept the  tightest possible hold on his own purse-strings and looked with marked  disfavour upon his aristocratic son-in-law's fondness for gaming tables  and betting books.    \"As a matter of fact, Maud Etty had married the handsome young  lieutenant in the Hussars, quite against her father's wishes. But she  was an only child, and after a good deal of demur and grumbling, Sir  John, who idolized his daughter, gave way to her whim, and a reluctant  consent to the marriage was wrung from him.    \"But, as a Yorkshireman, he was far too shrewd a man of the world not to  know that love played but a very small part in persuading a Duke's son  to marry the daughter of a cocoa manufacturer, and as long as he lived  he determined that since his daughter was being wed because of her  wealth, that wealth should at least secure her own happiness. He refused  to give Lady Arthur any capital, which, in spite of the most carefully  worded settlements, would inevitably, sooner or later, have found its  way into the pockets of Lord Arthur's racing friends. But he made his  daughter a very handsome allowance, amounting to over L3000 a year,  which enabled her to keep up an establishment befitting her new rank.    \"A great many of these facts, intimate enough as they are, leaked out,  you see, during that period of intense excitement which followed the  murder of Charles Lavender, and when the public eye was fixed  searchingly upon Lord Arthur Skelmerton, probing all the inner details  of his idle, useless life.    \"It soon became a matter of common gossip that poor little Lady Arthur  continued to worship her handsome husband in spite of his obvious  neglect, and not having as yet presented him with an heir, she settled  herself down into a life of humble apology for her plebeian existence,  atoning for it by condoning all his faults and forgiving all his vices,  even to the extent of cloaking them before the prying eyes of Sir John,  who was persuaded to look upon his son-in-law as a paragon of all the  domestic virtues and a perfect model of a husband.    \"Among Lord Arthur Skelmerton's many expensive tastes there was  certainly that for horseflesh and cards. After some successful betting  at the beginning of his married life, he had started a racing-stable  which it was generally believed--as he was very lucky--was a regular  source of income to him.    \"Peppercorn, however, after his brilliant performances at Newmarket did  not continue to fulfil his master's expectations. His collapse at York  was attributed to the hardness of the course and to various other  causes, but its immediate effect was to put Lord Arthur Skelmerton in  what is popularly called a tight place, for he had backed his horse for  all he was worth, and must have stood to lose considerably over L5000 on  that one day.    \"The collapse of the favourite and the grand victory of King Cole, a  rank outsider, on the other hand, had proved a golden harvest for the  bookmakers, and all the York hotels were busy with dinners and suppers  given by the confraternity of the Turf to celebrate the happy occasion.  The next day was Friday, one of few important racing events, after which  the brilliant and the shady throng which had flocked into the venerable  city for the week would fly to more congenial climes, and leave it, with  its fine old Minster and its ancient walls, as sleepy, as quiet as  before.    \"Lord Arthur Skelmerton also intended to leave York on the Saturday, and  on the Friday night he gave a farewell bachelor dinner party at 'The  Elms,' at which Lady Arthur did not appear. After dinner the gentlemen  settled down to bridge, with pretty stiff points, you may be sure. It  had just struck eleven at the Minster Tower, when constables McNaught  and Murphy, who were patrolling the racecourse, were startled by loud  cries of 'murder' and 'police.'    \"Quickly ascertaining whence these cries proceeded, they hurried on at a  gallop, and came up--quite close to the boundary of Lord Arthur  Skelmerton's grounds--upon a group of three men, two of whom seemed to  be wrestling vigorously with one another, whilst the third was lying  face downwards on the ground. As soon as the constables drew near, one  of the wrestlers shouted more vigorously, and with a certain tone of  authority:    \"'Here, you fellows, hurry up, sharp; the brute is giving me the slip!'    \"But the brute did not seem inclined to do anything of the sort; he  certainly extricated himself with a violent jerk from his assailant's  grasp, but made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#8)"],[1,"true  history, were believed by them to be the fourth in descent from a  fabulous deity, or from a man exalted by ignorance into that  character.  The dark industry of antiquaries, led by imaginary  analogies of names, or by uncertain traditions, would in vain attempt  to pierce into that deep obscurity which covers the remote history of  those nations.  [FN [g] Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15.  Saxon Chron. p. 13.  Nennius, cap.  28.]    These two brothers, observing the other provinces of Germany to be  occupied by a warlike and necessitous people, and the rich provinces  of Gaul already conquered or overrun by other German tribes, found it  easy to persuade their countrymen to embrace the sole enterprise which  promised a favourable opportunity of displaying their valour and  gratifying their avidity.  They embarked their troops in three  vessels, and about the year 449 or 450 [h], carried over 1600 men, who  landed in the Isle of Thanet, and immediately marched to the defence  of the Britons against the northern invaders.  The Scots and Picts  were unable to resist the valour of these auxiliaries; and the  Britons, applauding their own wisdom in calling over the Saxons, hoped  thenceforth to enjoy peace and security under the powerful protection  of that warlike people.  [FN [h] Saxon Chronicle, p. 12.  Gul. Malm. p. 11.  Huntington, lib.  2. p. 309.  Ethelwerd.  Brompton, p. 728.]    But Hengist and Horsa perceiving, from their easy victory over the  Scots and Picts, with what facility they might subdue the Britons  themselves, who had not been able to resist those feeble invaders,  were determined to conquer and fight for their own grandeur, not for  the defence of their degenerate allies.  They sent intelligence to  Saxony of the fertility and riches of Britain; and represented as  certain the subjection of a people so long disused to arms, who, being  now cut off from the Roman empire, of which they had been a province  during so many ages, had not yet acquired any union among themselves,  and were destitute of all affection to their new liberties and of all  national attachments and regards [i].  The vices and pusillanimity of  Vortigern, the British leader, were a new ground of hope; and the  Saxons in Germany, following such agreeable prospects, soon reinforced  Hengist and Horsa with 5000 men, who came over in seventeen vessels.  The Britons now began to entertain apprehensions of their allies,  whose numbers they found continually augmenting; but thought of no  remedy, except a passive submission and connivance.  This weak  expedient soon  failed them.  The Saxons sought a quarrel, by  complaining that their subsidies were ill paid, and their provisions  withdrawn [k]; and immediately taking off the mask, they formed an  alliance with the Picts and Scots, and proceeded to open hostility  against the Britons.  [FN [i] Chron. Sax. p. 12.  Ann. Beverl. p. 42.  [k] Bede, lib. 1.  cap. 15.  Nennius, cap. 35.  Gildas, Sec. 23.]    The Britons, impelled by these violent extremities, and roused to  indignation against their treacherous auxiliaries, were necessitated  to take arms; and having deposed Vortigern, who had become odious from  his vices, and from the bad event of his rash counsels, they put  themselves under the command of his son, Vortimer.  They fought many  battles with their enemies; and though the victories in these actions  be disputed between the British and Saxon annalists, the progress  still made by the Saxons proves that the advantage was commonly on  their side.  In one battle, however, fought at Eaglesford, now  Ailsford, Horsa, the Saxon general, was slain, and left the sole  command over his countrymen in the hands of Hengist.  This active  general, continually reinforced by fresh numbers from Germany, carried  devastation into the most remote corners of Britain; and being chiefly  anxious to spread the terror of his arms, he spared neither age, nor  sex, nor condition, wherever he marched with his victorious forces.  The private and public edifices of the Britons were reduced to ashes:  the priests were slaughtered on the altars by those idolatrous  ravagers: the bishops and nobility shared the fate of the vulgar: the  people, flying to the mountains and deserts, were intercepted and  butchered in heaps: some were glad to accept of life and servitude  under their victors: others, deserting their native country, took  shelter in the province of Armorica; where, being charitably received  by a people of the same language and manners, they settled in great  numbers, and gave the country the name of Britany [l].  [FN [l] Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15.  Usher, p.226.  Gildas, Sec. 24.]    The British writers assign one cause which facilitated the entrance of  the Saxons into this island; the love with which Vortigern was at  first seized for Rovena, the daughter of Hengist, and which that  artful warrior made use of to blind the eyes of the imprudent monarch  [m].  The same historians add, that Vortimer died; and that Vortigern,  being restored to the throne, accepted of a banquet from Hengist, at  Stonehenge, where 300 of his nobility were treacherously slaughtered,  and himself detained captive [n].  But these stories seem to have been  invented by the Welsh authors, in order to palliate the weak  resistance made at first by their countrymen, anal to account for the  rapid progress and licentious devastations of the Saxons [o].  [FN [m] Nennius, Galfr. lib. 6. cap. 12.  [n] Nennius, cap. 47.  Galfr.  [o] Stillingfleet's Orig. Brit. p. 324, 325.]    After the death of Vortimer, Ambrosius, a Briton, though of Roman  descent, invested with the command over his countrymen, and  endeavoured, not without success, to unite them in their resistance  against the Saxons. Those contests increased the animosity between the  two nations, and roused the military spirit of the ancient  inhabitants, which had before been sunk into a fatal lethargy.  Hengist, however, notwithstanding their opposition, still maintained  his ground in Britain; and in order to divide the forces and attention  of the natives, he called over a new tribe of Saxons, under the  command of his brother Octa, and of Ebissa, the son of Octa; and he  settled them in Northumberland.  He himself remained in the southern  parts of the island, and laid the foundation of the kingdom of Kent,  comprehending the county of that name, Middlesex, Essex, and part of  Surrey.  He fixed his royal seat at Canterbury; where he governed  about forty years, and he died in or near the year 488; leaving his  new-acquired dominions to his posterity.    The success of Hengist excited the avidity of the other northern  Germans; and at different times, and under different leaders, they  flocked over in multitudes to the invasion of this island.  These  conquerors were chiefly composed of three tribes, the Saxons, Angles,  and Jutes [p], who all passed under the common appellation, sometimes  of Saxons, sometimes of Angles; and speaking the same language, and  being governed by the same institutions, they were naturally led, from  these causes, as well as from their common interest, to unite  themselves against the ancient inhabitants.  The resistance, however,  though unequal, was still maintained by the Britons; but became every  day more feeble; and their calamities admitted of few intervals, till  they were driven into Cornwall and Wales, and received protection from  the remote situation or inaccessible mountains of those countries.  [FN [p] Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15.  Ethelwerd, p. 833. edit. Camdeni.  Chron. Sax. p. 12.  Ann. Beverl. p. 78.  The inhabitants of Kent, and  the Isle of Wight were Jutes.  Essex, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex, and  all the southern counties to Cornwall, were peopled by Saxons: Mercia,  and other parts of the kingdom, were inhabited by Angles.]    The first Saxon state, after that of Kent, which was established in  Britain, was the kingdom of South Saxony.  In the year 477 [q], Aella,  a Saxon chief, brought over an army from Germany; and landing on the  southern coast, proceeded to take possession of the neighbouring  territory.  The Britons, now armed, did not tamely abandon their  possessions; nor were they expelled, till defeated in many battles by  their warlike invaders.  The most memorable action, mentioned by  historians, is that of Meacredes Burn [r]; where, though the Saxons  seem to have obtained the victory, they suffered so considerable a  loss, as somewhat retarded the progress of their conquests.  But  Aella, reinforced by fresh numbers of his countrymen, again took the  field against the Britons, and laid siege to Andred-Ceaster, which was  defended by the garrison and inhabitants with desperate valour [s].  The Saxons, enraged by this resistance, and by the fatigues and  dangers which they had sustained, redoubled their efforts against the  place, and when masters of it, put all their enemies to the sword  without distinction.  This decisive advantage secured the conquests of  Aella, who assumed the name of king, and extended his dominion over  Sussex and a great part of Surrey.  He was stopped in his progress to  the east by the kingdom of Kent: in that to the west by another tribe  of Saxons, who had taken possession of that territory.  [FN [q] Chron. Sax. p.14.  Ann. Beverl. p. 81.  [r] Saxon Chron. A.D.  485.  Flor. Wigorn.  [s] Hen. Hunting. lib. 2.]    These Saxons, from the situation of the country in which they settled,  were called the West Saxons, and landed in the year 495, under the  command of Cerdic, and of his son Kenric [t].  The Britons were, by  past experience, so much on their guard, and so well prepared to  receive the enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the very day of his  landing; and though vanquished, still defended, for some time, their  liberties against the invaders.  None of the other tribes of Saxons  met with such vigorous resistance, or exerted such valour and  perseverance in pushing"]]]
