When an animal breaks a limb, or  is otherwise disabled from serving his master, he carries him to the  hospital, and, indifferent to what nation or caste the owner may belong,  the patient is never refused admittance. If he recover, he cannot be  reclaimed, but must remain in the hospital for life, subject to the duty  of drawing water for those pensioners debilitated by age or disease from  procuring it for themselves. At my visit, the hospital contained horses,  mules, oxen, sheep, goats, monkeys, poultry, pigeons, and a variety of  birds, with an aged tortoise, who was known to have been there for  seventy-five years. The most extraordinary ward was that appropriated  to rats, mice, bugs, and other noxious vermin. The overseers of the  hospital frequently hire beggars from the streets, for a stipulated  sum, to pass a night among the fleas, lice, and bugs, on the express  condition of suffering them to enjoy their feast without molestation.    _Forbes's Oriental Memoirs._           *       *       *       *       *          Useful Domestic Hints           *       *       *       *       *      NORFOLK PUNCH. NO. 1.      In twenty quarts of French brandy put the peels of thirty lemons and  thirty oranges, pared so thin that not the least of the white is left;  infuse twelve hours. Have ready thirty quarts of cold water that has  been boiled; put to it fifteen pounds of double-refined sugar; and when  well mixed, pour it upon the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the  oranges and of twenty-four lemons; mix well. Then strain, through a fine  hair-sieve, into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and put two  quarts of new milk. Stir, and then bung it close; let it stand six weeks  in a warm cellar; bottle the liquor for use, taking great care that the  bottles are perfectly clean and dry, and the corks of the best quality  and well put in. This liquor will keep many years, and improves by  age.--_The Vintner's Guide._      NORFOLK PUNCH. NO. 2.      Pare six lemons and three Seville oranges very thin; squeeze the juice  into a large jar; put to it two quarts of brandy, one of white wine, and  one of milk, and one pound and a quarter of sugar. Let it be mixed, and  then covered for twenty-four hours. Strain through a jelly-bag till  clear, then bottle it.--_Ibid._      TO MANAGE AND IMPROVE RED PORT WINE WHEN POOR AND THIN.      If your wines be sound, but wanting in body, colour, and flavour, draw  out thirty or forty gallons, and return the same quantity of young and  rich wines, such its are generally brought to this country for that  purpose; to a can of which put a quart of colouring, with a bottle of  wine or brandy, in which half an ounce of powdered cochineal has been  previously mixed. Whisk it well together, and put it in your cask,  stirring it well about with a staff; and if not bright in about a week  or ten days, you may fine it for use; previous to which, put in at  different times a gallon of good brandy. If Port wines are short of  body, put a gallon or two of brandy into each pipe, as you see  necessary. If the wines be in your own stock, put it in by a quart or  two at a time, as it feeds the wine better in this way than putting it  in all at once; but, if your wines are in a bonded cellar, procure a  funnel that will go down to the bottom of the cask, that the brandy may  be completely incorporated with the wine. When your Port is thus made  fine and pleasant, bottle it off, taking care to pack it in a temperate  place with saw-dust or dry sand, after which it will not be proper to  drink for at least two months. When laying your wines down in bottles  you should never use new deal saw-dust, as that causes it to fret too  much, and often communicates a strong turpentine smell through the corks  to the wine.--_Ibid._      RED CURRANT WINE.      Take seventy pounds of red currants, bruised and pressed, good moist  sugar forty-five pounds, water sufficient to fill up a fifteen-gallon  cask, ferment; this produces a very pleasant red wine, rather tart, but  keeps well.--_Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *          The Gatherer.    \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other men's stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *    ON CRANIOLOGY.

The coach-office  undertook to deliver the boxes of snow and hail. The winds and tempest  came later than we expected--we even lost a zephyr. The thunder got  broke on the road, and we have been forced to have fresh sodder for the  two lightnings. Our divinities are well, with the exception of Love, who  has got the small-pox; the Graces have been inoculated; we were obliged  to leave them behind on the road, with the brick wall, which being wrapt  round the sun to keep it from getting soiled, was rubbed to pieces by  the sharp rays. Our rivers and sea are coming by water; and pray, when  you come yourself, do not forget to bring lots of clouds with you, and a  new moon. A torrent too will be wanted, for our last has most unluckily  got burnt. I am anxious for a full account of all your purchases, to  which you must add two yards of weeping willows.

NOVEMBER.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The _Epulum Jovis_ was a sumptuous feast offered to Jupiter on the  13th of November. The gods were formally invited, and attended; for the  statues were brought in rich beds, furnished with soft pillows, called  _pulvinaria_. Thus accommodated, their godships were placed on their  couches at the most honourable part of the table, and served with the  rich dainties, as if they were able to eat; but the _epulones_, or  ministers, who had the care and management of the feast, performed that  function for them, and no doubt did the part of _gastronomic proxies_  with _eclat_.    The _Brumalia_ was a feast of Bacchus, celebrated among the Romans  during the space of thirty days, commencing on the 24th of November. It  was instituted by Romulus, who used, during this time, to entertain the  senate. During this feast indications were taken of the felicity of the  remaining part of the winter.    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *          The Gatherer.        \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"  SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *      INNOCENT CONFESSION.      A Lady at confession, amongst other heinous crimes, accused herself of  using rouge. \"What is the use of it?\" asked the confessor. \"I do it to  make myself handsomer.\"--\"And does it produce that effect?\" \"At least  I think so, father.\"--The confessor on this took his penitent out of the  confessional, and having looked at her attentively in the light, said,  \"Well, madam, you may use rouge, for you are ugly enough even with it.\"           *       *       *       *       *      MERCHANT TAILORS.      A Clergyman hearing a remark made on the humility of the Merchant Tailors'  motto, \"_Concordia parvae res crescunt_\" replied, \"Yes, that is to  say, nine tailors make a man.\"           *       *       *       *       *      RABELAIS.    A JEU D'ESPRIT.        In France they say    Lived RABELAIS,    A witty wight, and a right merry fellow.    Who in good company was sometimes mellow:              And,    Although he was a priest,    Thought it no sacramental sin--to feast.    I can't say much for his morality:    But for his immortality,              Good luck!    Why he's bound in calf, and squeezed in boards,    And scarcely a good library's shelf    But boasts acquaintance with the elf.    But now I'll tell you what I should have told before,    A grievous illness brought him nigh _Death's_ door.    Who, bony wight,    Enjoyed the sight--    And grinn'd as he thought of the fun there'd be    When the jester had joined his company.      Rab's friends, good folk!    Thought it no joke    To the poor joker; they therefore sent around    For all the Esculapians to be found;    And in a trice    (For doctors always haste to give advice--    Mind--don't mistake--I mean when there's a fee)    They mustered two--to which add three.      Now about the bed    Is seen each learned head.    The patient's pulse is felt--with graver air    Each M.D. seats him in a chair.    Crosses his legs--leans on his stick, mums--hahs--and hums    Pulls out his watch--takes snuff--and twirls his thumbs.      At length,    The awful stillness broke--      As if from silence gathering strength    Most lustily they all did croak,    Their opinions mingling,    In discordant jingling--    \"A purge\"--\"a blister\"--\"shave his head\"    \"Senna and salts\"--\"a clyster\"--\"have him bled,\"    \"A pill at noon\"--\"another pill at night,\"    \"A warm-bath, sure, would set him right.\"    Thus with purges and blisters,    Pills, bleeding, and clysters,    The poor patient they threatened    Should be deluged and sweatened.      Unable to endure the riot,    And wishing for a little quiet,    The sickman raised his head,    And said--    Gentlemen, I do beseech ye, cease your pother,    Nor any more with me your wise heads bother,    Scratching your wigs,    Like sapient pigs;    Whate'er you may decide is my disease,    I humbly do conceive a little ease    From your infernal noise and chatter.    With which I'm dunn'd    And nearly stunn'd,    Would greatly tend to mend the matter;    And if, perforce, I must resign my breath,    For heav'n's sake let me _die_ a NATURAL _death_.      P.M.           *       *       *       *       *      AN AGITATOR.      M. Monchenut, an old man of eighty, afflicted with the palsy, was  arrested during the reign of terror, under suspicion of being an agitator.  Being asked what he had to say to the accusation, \"Alas, gentlemen, it is  very true, I am agitated enough, God knows, for I have not been able to  keep a limb still for these fifteen years.\"           *       *       *       *       *      CHINESE POLITENESS.      There is one striking particular in which the Chinese politeness is quite  the reverse of ours. To take off their caps when they salute one another,  or even accidentally to appear uncovered, is esteemed the height of ill  breeding and indecency.
