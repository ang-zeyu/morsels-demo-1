He expressed his satisfaction at seeing  him, and desired him to place himself so as to write under his  dictation. Hardly was the letter done, when a bomb, projected from the  English batteries, fell at the distance of ten yards, and, exploding,  covered all present with gravel and dust. \"Well,\" said Junot, laughing,  \"we shall at least not require sand to dry the ink.\"    Bonaparte fixed his eyes on the young sergeant; he was calm, and had  not even quivered at the explosion. That event decided his fortune.  He remained attached to the commander of artillery, and returned no  more to his corps. At a subsequent time, when the town surrendered, and  Bonaparte was appointed General, Junot asked no other recompense for his  brave conduct during the siege, but to be named his aide-de-camp. He and  Muiron were the first who served him in that capacity.--_Memoirs of the  Duchess of Abrantes._           *       *       *       *       *      EFFECT OF DISEASE ON MEMORY.      Failure of memory takes place in a variety of ways. It is sometimes  general, and extends to every subject; but it is frequently far more  manifest on some subjects than on others. Salmuth mentions a case in  which the affected person had forgotten to pronounce words, but could  nevertheless write them. Mr. J. Hunter was suddenly attacked with a  singular affection of this kind in December 1789, when on a visit at the  house of a friend in town. \"He did not know in what part of the house he  was, not even the name of the street when told it, nor where his own house  was: he had not a conception of any thing existing beyond the room he was  in, and yet was perfectly conscious of the loss of memory. He was sensible  of impressions of all kinds from the senses, and therefore looked out of  the window, although rather dark, to see if he could be made sensible of  the situation of the house. The loss of memory gradually went off, and in  less than half an hour his memory was perfectly recovered.\" This might  possibly be connected with a gouty habit to which Mr. Hunter was subject,  though not at this time labouring under a paroxysm. The late Bishop of  Landaff, Dr. Watson, gives a singular case of partial amnesia in his  father, the result of an apoplectic attack. \"I have heard him ask twenty  times a-day,\" says Dr. Watson, \"What is the name of the lad that is at  college?\" (my elder brother); and yet he was able to repeat, without a  blunder, hundreds of lines out of classic authors. And hence, there is  no reason for discrediting the story of a German statesman, a Mr. Von B.  related in the seventh volume of the _Psycological Magazine_, who  having called at a gentleman's house, the servants of which did not know  him, was under the necessity of giving in his name; but unfortunately at  that moment he had forgotten it, and excited no small laughter by turning  round to a friend who accompanied him, and saying with great earnestness,  \"Pray tell me who I am, for I cannot recollect.\"    From severe suffering of the head in many fevers a great inroad is  frequently made upon the memory, and it is long before the convalescent  can rightly put together all the ideas of his past life. Such was one of  the effects of the plague at Athens, as we learn from Thucydides; \"and  many, on recovery, still experienced such any extraordinary oblivion of  all things that they knew neither themselves nor their friends.\" A few  years ago a man with a brain-fever was taken into St. Thomas's Hospital,  who as he grew better spoke to his attendants, but in a language they  did not understand. A Welsh milk-woman going by accident into the ward,  heard him, answered him and conversed with him. It was then found that  the patient was by birth a Welshman, but had left his native land in  his youth, forgotten his native dialect, and used English for the last  thirty years. Yet, in consequence of this fever he had now forgotten the  English tongue, and suddenly recovered the Welsh.    Boerhaave, however, gives a still more extraordinary instance of  oblivion in the case of a Spanish tragic author who had composed many  excellent pieces, but so completely lost his memory in consequence of  an acute fever, that he forgot not only the languages he had formerly  learnt, but even the alphabet; and was hence under the necessity of  beginning to read again. His own poems and compositions were shown  to him, but he could not he persuaded that they were his production.  Afterwards, however, he began once more to compose verses; which had so  striking a resemblance to his former writings that he at length became  convinced of his being the author of them.--_From the Doctor._           *       *       *       *       *      READING COINS IN THE DARK.    (_From Sir David Brewster's Letters on Natural Magic_.)      Among the numerous experiments with which science astonishes and  sometimes even strikes terror into the ignorant, there is none more  calculated to produce this effect than that of displaying to the eye  in absolute darkness the legend or inscription upon a coin. To do this,  take a silver coin, (I have always used an old one,) and after polishing  the surface as much as possible, make the parts of it which are raised  rough by the action of an acid, the parts not raised, or those which  are to be rendered darkest, retaining their polish. If the coin thus  prepared is placed upon a mass of red hot iron, and removed into a dark  room, the inscription upon it will become less luminous than the rest,  so that it may be distinctly read by the spectator. The mass of red hot  iron should be concealed from the observer's eye, both for the purpose  of rendering the eye fitter for observing the effect, and of removing  all doubt that the inscription is really read in the dark, that is,  without receiving any light, direct or reflected, from any other body.  If, in place of polishing the depressed parts, and roughening its raised  parts, we make the raised parts polished, and roughen the depressed  parts, the inscription will now be less luminous than the depressed  parts, and we shall still be able to read it, from its being as it were  written in black letters on a white ground. The first time I made this  experiment, without being aware of what would be the result, I used a  French shilling of Louis XV. and I was not a little surprised to observe  upon its surface in black letters the inscription BENEDICTUM SIT NOMEN  DEI.    The most surprising form of this experiment is when we use a coin from  which the inscription has been either wholly obliterated, or obliterated  in such a degree as to be illegible. When such a coin is laid upon the  red hot iron, the letters and figures become oxidated, and the film of  oxide radiating more powerfully than the rest of the coin will be more  luminous than the rest of the coin, and the illegible inscription may  be now distinctly read to the great surprise of the observer, who had  examined the blank surface of the coin previous to its being placed upon  the hot iron.    In order to explain the cause of these remarkable effects, we must  notice a method which has been long known, though never explained, of  deciphering the inscriptions on worn out coins. This is done by merely  placing the coin upon a hot iron: an oxidation takes place over the  whole surface of the coin, the film of oxide changing its tint with the  intensity or continuance of the heat. The parts, however, where the  letters of the inscription had existed, oxidate at a different rate from  the surrounding parts, so that these letters exhibit their shape, and  become legible in consequence of the film of oxide which covers them  having a different thickness, and therefore reflecting a different tint  from that of the adjacent parts. The tints thus developed sometimes pass  through many orders of brilliant colours, particularly _pink_ and  _green_, and settle in a bronze, and sometimes a black tint, resting  upon the inscription alone. In some cases the tint left on the trace of  the letters is so very faint that it can just be seen, and may be  entirely removed by a slight rub of the finger.    When the experiment is often repeated with the same coin, and the  oxidations successively removed after each experiment, the film of oxide  continues to diminish, and at last ceases to make its appearance. It  recovers the property however, in the course of time. When the coin is put  upon the hot iron, and consequently when the oxidation is the greatest, a  considerable smoke arises from the coin, and this diminishes like the film  of oxide by frequent repetition. A coin which had ceased to emit this  smoke, smoked slightly after having been exposed twelve hours to the air.  I have found from numerous trials that it is always the raised parts of  the coin, and in modern coins the elevated ledge round the inscription,  that becomes first oxidated. In an English shilling of 1816 this ledge  exhibited a brilliant yellow tint before it appeared on any other part  of the coin.    If we use an uniform and homogeneous disc of silver that has never been  hammered or compressed, its surface will oxidate equally, provided all  its parts are equally heated. In the process of converting this disc  into a coin, the _sunk_ parts have obviously been _most compressed_  by the prominent parts of the die, and the _elevated_ parts _least  compressed_, the metal being in the latter left as it were in its  natural state. The raised letters and figures on a coin have therefore  less density than the other parts, and these parts oxiditate sooner or  at a lower temperature. When the letters of the legend are worn off by  friction, the parts immediately below them have also less density than  the surrounding metal, and the site as it were of the letters therefore  receive from heat a degree of oxidation, and a colour different from  that of the surrounding surface.
