If in outward things, call them not friends, any  more than faithful, constant, brave or free: call them not even human  beings, if you have any sense. . . . But should you hear that these men  hold the Good to lie only in the Will, only in rightly dealing with the  things of sense, take no more trouble to inquire whether they are father  and son or brothers, or comrades of long standing; but, sure of this  one thing, pronounce as boldly that they are friends as that they are  faithful and just: for where else can Friendship be found than where  Modesty is, where there is an interchange of things fair and honest, and  of such only?          LXXXIII    No man can rob us of our Will--no man can lord it over that!          LXXXIV    When disease and death overtake me, I would fain be found engaged in  the task of liberating mine own Will from the assaults of passion, from  hindrance, from resentment, from slavery.    Thus would I fain to be found employed, so that I may say to God, \"Have  I in aught transgressed Thy commands? Have I in aught perverted the  faculties, the senses, the natural principles that Thou didst give me?  Have I ever blamed Thee or found fault with Thine administration? When  it was Thy good pleasure, I fell sick--and so did other men: by my will  consented. Because it was Thy pleasure, I became poor: but my heart  rejoiced. No power in the State was mine, because Thou wouldst not:  such power I never desired! Hast Thou ever seen me of more doleful  countenance on that account? Have I not ever drawn nigh unto Thee with  cheerful look, waiting upon Thy commands, attentive to Thy signals? Wilt  Thou that I now depart from the great Assembly of men? I go: I give Thee  all thanks, that Thou hast deemed me worthy to take part with Thee  in this Assembly: to behold Thy works, to comprehend this Thine  administration.\"    Such I would were the subject of my thoughts, my pen, my study, when  death overtakes me.          LXXXV    Seemeth it nothing to you, never to accuse, never to blame either God or  Man? to wear ever the same countenance in going forth as in coming  in? This was the secret of Socrates: yet he never said that he knew  or taught anything. . . . Who amongst you makes this his aim? Were it  indeed so, you would gladly endure sickness, hunger, aye, death itself.          LXXXVI    How are we constituted by Nature? To be free, to be noble, to be modest  (for what other living thing is capable of blushing, or of feeling the  impression of shame?) and to subordinate pleasure to the ends for which  Nature designed us, as a handmaid and a minister, in order to call forth  our activity; in order to keep us constant to the path prescribed by  Nature.          LXXXVII    The husbandman deals with land; physicians and trainers with the body;  the wise man with his own Mind.          LXXXVIII    Which of us does not admire what Lycurgus the Spartan did? A young  citizen had put out his eye, and been handed over to him by the people  to be punished at his own discretion. Lycurgus abstained from all  vengeance, but on the contrary instructed and made a good man of him.  Producing him in public in the theatre, he said to the astonished  Spartans:--\"I received this young man at your hands full of violence  and wanton insolence; I restore him to you in his right mind and fit to  serve his country.\"          LXXXIX    A money-changer may not reject Caesar's coin, nor may the seller of  herbs, but must when once the coin is shown, deliver what is sold for  it, whether he will or no. So is it also with the Soul. Once the Good  appears, it attracts towards itself; evil repels. But a clear and  certain impression of the Good the Soul will never reject, any more than  men do Caesar's coin. On this hangs every impulse alike of Man and God.          XC    Asked what Common Sense was, Epictetus replied:--    As that may be called a Common Ear which distinguishes only sounds,  while that which distinguishes musical notes is not common but produced  by training; so there are certain things which men not entirely  perverted see by the natural principles common to all. Such a  constitution of the Mind is called Common Sense.          XCI    Canst thou judge men? . . . then make us imitators of thyself, as  Socrates did. Do this, do not do that, else will I cast thee into  prison; this is not governing men like reasonable creatures. Say  rather, As God hath ordained, so do; else thou wilt suffer chastisement  and loss. Askest thou what loss? None other than this: To have left  undone what thou shouldst have done: to have lost the faithfulness, the  reverence, the modesty that is in thee! Greater loss than this seek not  to find!          XCII    \"His son is dead.\"    What has happened?    \"His son is dead.\"    Nothing more?    \"Nothing.\"    \"His ship is lost.\"    \"He has been haled to prison.\"    What has happened?    \"He has been haled to prison.\"    But that any of these things are misfortunes to him, is an addition  which every one makes of his own. But (you say) God is unjust is  this.--Why? For having given thee endurance and greatness of soul? For  having made such things to be no evils? For placing happiness within thy  reach, even when enduring them? For open unto thee a door, when things  make not for thy good?--Depart, my friend and find fault no more!          XCIII    You are sailing to Rome (you tell me) to obtain the post of Governor of  Cnossus. You are not content to stay at home with the honours you had  before; you want something on a larger scale, and more conspicuous. But  when did you ever undertake a voyage for the purpose of reviewing your  own principles and getting rid of any of them that proved unsound? Whom  did you ever visit for that object? What time did you ever set yourself  for that? What age? Run over the times of your life--by yourself, if you  are ashamed before me. Did you examine your principles when a boy? Did  you not do everything just as you do now? Or when you were a stripling,  attending the school of oratory and practising the art yourself, what  did you ever imagine you lacked? And when you were a young man, entered  upon public life, and were pleading causes and making a name, who any  longer seemed equal to you? And at what moment would you have endured  another examining your principles and proving that they were unsound?  What then am I to say to you? \"Help me in this matter!\" you cry. Ah, for  that I have no rule! And neither did you, if that was your object, come  to me as a philosopher, but as you might have gone to a herb-seller or  a cobbler.--\"What do philosophers have rules for, then?\"--Why, that  whatever may betide, our ruling faculty may be as Nature would have it,  and so remain. Think you this a small matter? Not so! but the greatest  thing there is. Well, does it need but a short time? Can it be grasped  by a passer-by?--grasp it, if you can!    Then you will say, \"Yes, I met Epictetus!\"    Aye, just as you might a statue or a monument. You saw me! and that is  all. But a man who meets a man is one who learns the other's mind, and  lets him see his in turn. Learn my mind--show me yours; and then go  and say that you met me. Let us try each other; if I have any wrong  principle, rid me of it; if you have, out with it. That is what meeting  a philosopher means. Not so, you think; this is only a flying visit;  while we are hiring the ship, we can see Epictetus too! Let us see  what he has to say. Then on leaving you cry, \"Out on Epictetus for a  worthless fellow, provincial and barbarous of speech!\" What else indeed  did you come to judge of?          XCIV    Whether you will or no, you are poorer than I!    \"What then do I lack?\"    What you have not: Constancy of mind, such as Nature would have it be:  Tranquillity. Patron or no patron, what care I? but you do care. I am  richer than you: I am not racked with anxiety as to what Caesar may  think of me; I flatter none on that account. This is what I have,  instead of vessels of gold and silver! your vessels may be of gold, but  your reason, your principles, your accepted views, your inclinations,  your desires are of earthenware.          XCV    To you, all you have seems small: to me, all I have seems great. Your  desire is insatiable, mine is satisfied. See children thrusting their  hands into a narrow-necked jar, and striving to pull out the nuts and  figs it contains: if they fill the hand, they cannot pull it out again,  and then they fall to tears.--\"Let go a few of them, and then you  can draw out the rest!\"--You, too, let your desire go! covet not many  things, and you will obtain.          XCVI    Pittacus wronged by one whom he had it in his power to punish, let  him go free, saying, Forgiveness is better than revenge. The one shows  native gentleness, the other savagery.          XCVII    \"My brother ought not to have treated me thus.\"    True: but he must see to that. However he may treat me, I must deal  rightly by him. This is what lies with me, what none can hinder.          XCVIII    Nevertheless a man should also be prepared to be sufficient unto  himself--to dwell with himself alone, even as God dwells with Himself  alone, shares His repose with none, and considers the nature of His own  administration, intent upon such thoughts as are meet unto Himself. So  should we also be able to converse with ourselves, to need none else  beside, to sigh for no distraction, to bend our thoughts upon the Divine  Administration, and how we stand related to all else; to observe how  human accidents touched us of old, and how they touch us now; what  things they are that still have power to hurt us, and how they may  be cured or removed; to perfect what needs perfecting as Reason would  direct.          XCIX    If a man has frequent intercourse with others, either in the way of  conversation,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],[0,"A Man of Means (#7)"],[1,"m?\" said Bromham Rhodes.    \"My friend, Mr. Bleke, is putting up the money,\" said Miss Verepoint,  with dignity. \"He has taken the Windsor Theater.\"    The interest of the two authors in their host, till then languid,  increased with a jerk. \"Has he? By Jove!\" they cried. \"We must get  together and talk this over.\"    It was Roland's first experience of a theatrical talking-over, and he  never forgot it. Two such talkers-over as Bromham Rhodes and R. P. de  Parys were scarcely to be found in the length and breadth of theatrical  London. Nothing, it seemed, could the gifted pair even begin to think of  doing without first discussing the proposition in all its aspects. The  amount of food which Roland found himself compelled to absorb during the  course of these debates was appalling. Discussions which began at lunch  would be continued until it was time to order dinner; and then, as  likely as not, they would have to sit there till supper-time in order to  thrash the question thoroughly out.           *       *       *       *       *    The collection of a cast was a matter even more complicated than the  actual composition of the revue. There was the almost insuperable  difficulty that Miss Verepoint firmly vetoed every name suggested. It  seemed practically impossible to find any man or woman in all England  or America whose peculiar gifts or lack of them would not interfere  with Miss Verepoint's giving a satisfactory performance of the principal  role. It was all very perplexing to Roland; but as Miss Verepoint was an  expert in theatrical matters, he scarcely felt entitled to question her  views.    It was about this time that Roland proposed to Miss Verepoint. The  passage of time and the strain of talking over the revue had to a  certain extent moderated his original fervor. He had shaded off from  a passionate devotion, through various diminishing tints of regard for  her, into a sort of pale sunset glow of affection. His principal reason  for proposing was that it seemed to him to be in the natural order of  events. Her air towards him had become distinctly proprietorial. She now  called him \"Roly-poly\" in public--a proceeding which left him with mixed  feelings. Also, she had taken to ordering him about, which, as everybody  knows, is an unmistakable sign of affection among ladies of the  theatrical profession. Finally, in his chivalrous way, Roland had  begun to feel a little apprehensive lest he might be compromising Miss  Verepoint. Everybody knew that he was putting up the money for the  revue in which she was to appear; they were constantly seen together at  restaurants; people looked arch when they spoke to him about her. He had  to ask himself: was he behaving like a perfect gentleman? The answer was  in the negative. He took a cab to her flat and proposed before he could  repent of his decision.    She accepted him. He was not certain for a moment whether he was glad  or sorry. \"But I don't want to get married,\" she went on, \"until I have  justified my choice of a profession. You will have to wait until I have  made a success in this revue.\"    Roland was shocked to find himself hugely relieved at this concession.    The revue took shape. There did apparently exist a handful of artistes  to whom Miss Verepoint had no objection, and these--a scrubby but  confident lot--were promptly engaged. Sallow Americans sprang from  nowhere with songs, dances, and ideas for effects. Tousled-haired scenic  artists wandered in with model scenes under their arms. A great cloud of  chorus-ladies settled upon the theater like flies. Even Bromham Rhodes  and R. P. de Parys--those human pythons--showed signs of activity. They  cornered Roland one day near Swan and Edgar's, steered him into the  Piccadilly Grill-room and, over a hearty lunch, read him extracts from  a brown-paper-covered manuscript which, they informed him, was the first  act.    It looked a battered sort of manuscript and, indeed, it had every right  to be. Under various titles and at various times, Bromham Rhodes' and R.  P. de Parys' first act had been refused by practically every responsible  manager in London. As \"Oh! What a Life!\" it had failed to satisfy the  directors of the Empire. Re-christened \"Wow-Wow!\" it had been rejected  by the Alhambra. The Hippodrome had refused to consider it, even under  the name of \"Hullo, Cellar-Flap!\" It was now called, \"Pass Along,  Please!\" and, according to its authors, was a real revue.    Roland was to learn, as the days went on, that in the world in which he  was moving everything was real revue that was not a stunt or a corking  effect. He floundered in a sea of real revue, stunts, and corking  effects. As far as he could gather, the main difference between these  things was that real revue was something which had been stolen from some  previous English production, whereas a stunt or a corking effect was  something which had been looted from New York. A judicious blend of  these, he was given to understand, constituted the sort of thing the  public wanted.    Rehearsals began before, in Roland's opinion, his little army was  properly supplied with ammunition. True, they had the first act, but  even the authors agreed that it wanted bringing up-to-date in parts.  They explained that it was, in a manner of speaking, their life-work,  that they had actually started it about ten years ago when they were  careless lads. Inevitably, it was spotted here and there with smart  topical hits of the early years of the century; but that, they said,  would be all right. They could freshen it up in a couple of evenings; it  was simply a matter of deleting allusions to pro-Boers and substituting  lines about Marconi shares and mangel-wurzels. \"It'll be all right,\"  they assured Roland; \"this is real revue.\"    In times of trouble there is always a point at which one may say,  \"Here is the beginning of the end.\" This point came with Roland at the  commencement of the rehearsals. Till then he had not fully realized  the terrible nature of the production for which he had made himself  responsible. Moreover, it was rehearsals which gave him his first clear  insight into the character of Miss Verepoint.    Miss Verepoint was not at her best at rehearsals. For the first time, as  he watched her, Roland found himself feeling that there was a case to  be made out for the managers who had so consistently kept her in the  background. Miss Verepoint, to use the technical term, threw her weight  about. There were not many good lines in the script of act one of \"Pass  Along, Please!\" but such as there were she reached out for and  grabbed away from their owners, who retired into corners, scowling and  muttering, like dogs robbed of bones. She snubbed everybody, Roland  included.           *       *       *       *       *    Roland sat in the cold darkness of the stalls and watched her,  panic-stricken. Like an icy wave, it had swept over him what marriage  with this girl would mean. He suddenly realised how essentially domestic  his instincts really were. Life with Miss Verepoint would mean perpetual  dinners at restaurants, bread-throwing suppers, motor-rides--everything  that he hated most. Yet, as a man of honor, he was tied to her. If the  revue was a success, she would marry him--and revues, he knew, were  always successes. At that very moment there were six \"best revues in  London,\" running at various theaters. He shuddered at the thought that  in a few weeks there would be seven.    He felt a longing for rural solitude. He wanted to be alone by  himself for a day or two in a place where there were no papers with  advertisements of revues, no grill-rooms, and, above all, no Miss Billy  Verepoint. That night he stole away to a Norfolk village, where, in  happier days, he had once spent a Summer holiday--a peaceful, primitive  place where the inhabitants could not have told real revue from a  corking effect.    Here, for the space of a week, Roland lay in hiding, while his quivering  nerves gradually recovered tone. He returned to London happier, but a  little apprehensive. Beyond a brief telegram of farewell, he had not  communicated with Miss Verepoint for seven days, and experience had  made him aware that she was a lady who demanded an adequate amount of  attention.    That his nervous system was not wholly restored to health was borne in  upon him as he walked along Piccadilly on his way to his flat; for,  when somebody suddenly slapped him hard between the shoulder-blades, he  uttered a stifled yell and leaped in the air.    Turning to face his assailant, he found himself meeting the genial  gaze of Mr. Montague, his predecessor in the ownership of the Windsor  Theater.    Mr. Montague was effusively friendly, and, for some mysterious reason,  congratulatory.    \"You've done it, have you? You pulled it off, did you? And in the  first month--by George! And I took you for the plain, ordinary mug of  commerce! My boy, you're as deep as they make 'em. Who'd have thought  it, to look at you? It was the greatest idea any one ever had and  staring me in the face all the time and I never saw it! But I don't  grudge it to you--you deserve it my boy! You're a nut!\"    \"I really don't know what you mean.\"    \"Quite right, my boy!\" chuckled Mr. Montague. \"You're quite right to  keep it up, even among friends. It don't do to risk anything, and the  least said soonest mended.\"    He went on his way, leaving Roland completely mystified.    Voices from his sitting-room, among which he recognized the high note of  Miss Verepoint, reminded him of the ordeal before him. He entered with  what he hoped was a careless ease of manner, but his heart was beating  fast. Since the opening of rehearsals he had acquired a wholesome  respect for Miss Verepoint's tongue. She was sitting in his favorite  chair. There were also present Bromham Rhodes and R. P. de Parys, who  had made themselves completely at home with a couple of his cigars and"]]]
