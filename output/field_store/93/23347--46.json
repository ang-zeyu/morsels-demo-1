[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10956"],[0,"Indian speeches (1907-1909) (#8)"],[1," have said enough to convince you that I  am doing what I believe you would desire me to do--conducting  administration in the spirit which I believe you will approve;  listening with impartiality to all I can learn; desirous to support  all those who are toiling at arduous work in India; and that we shall  not be deterred from pursuing to the end, a policy of firmness on the  one hand, and of liberal and steady reform on the other. We shall not  see all the fruits of it in our day. So be it. We shall at least have  made not only a beginning, but a marked advance both in order  and progress, by resolute patience, and an unflagging spirit of  conciliation.          III      AN AMENDMENT TO THE ADDRESS    (HOUSE OF COMMONS. JAN. 31, 1908)        DR. RUTHERFORD (Middlesex, Brentford) rose to move as an Amendment      to the Address, at the end to add,--\"But humbly submits that the      present condition of affairs in India demands the immediate and      serious attention of his Majesty's Government; that the present      proposals of the Government of India are inadequate to allay the      existing and growing discontent; and that comprehensive measures      of reform are imperatively necessary in the direction of giving      the people of India control over their own affairs.\"    MR. DEPUTY-SPEAKER, I think the House will allow me in the remarks  that I wish to make, to refer to a communication that I had received,  namely, the decision arrived at by the Transvaal Government in respect  to the question of Asiatics. Everybody in the House is aware of the  enormous interest, even passionate interest, that has been taken in  this subject, especially in India, and for very good reasons. Without  further preface let me say, this is the statement received by Lord  Elgin from the Government of the Transvaal last night:--\"Gandhi and  other leaders of the Indian and Chinese communities have offered  voluntary registration in a body within three months, provided  signatures only are taken of educated, propertied, or well-known  Asiatics, and finger-prints of the others, and that no question  against which Asiatics have religious objections be pressed. The  Transvaal Government have accepted this offer, and undertaken, pending  registration, not to enforce the penalties under the Act against all  those who register. The sentences of all Asiatics in prison will be  remitted to-morrow.\" Lord Selborne adds, \"This course was agreed to by  both political parties.\" I am sure that everybody in the House will  think that very welcome news. I do not like to let the matter drop  without saying a word--I am sure Lord Elgin would like me to say  it--in recognition of the good spirit shown by the Transvaal  Government.    In reference to the Amendment now before the House, I have listened  to the debate with keen, lively, and close interest. I am not one of  those who have usually complained of these grave topics being raised,  when fair opportunity offered in this House. On the whole, looking  back over my Parliamentary lifetime, which is now pretty long, I think  there has been too little Indian discussion. Before I came here there  were powerful minds like Mr. Fawcett and Mr. Bradlaugh and others, who  constantly raised Indian questions in a truly serious and practical  way, though I do not at all commit myself to the various points  of view that were then adopted. But, of course, this is a vote of  confidence. I am not going to ask members to vote for the Government  on that ground. But I must submit that His Majesty's present  Government in the Indian department has the confidence both of the  House and of the country. I believe we have. An important suggestion  was made by my hon. friend now sitting below the gangway, that a  Parliamentary Committee should sit--I presume a joint committee of the  two Houses--and my hon. friend who spoke last, said that the fact of  the existence of that committee would bring Parliament into closer  contact with the mind of India. Well, ever since I have been at the  India Office I have rather inclined in the direction of one of the old  Parliamentary Committees. I will not argue the question now. I can  only assure my hon. friend that the question has been considered  by me, and I see what its advantages might be, yet I also perceive  serious disadvantages. In the old days they were able to command the  services on the Indian committees, of ex-Ministers, of members of this  House and members of another place, who had had much experience  of Indian administration, and I am doubtful, considering the  preoccupations of public men, whether we should now be able to call a  large body of experienced administrators, with the necessary balance  between the two Houses, to sit on one of these committees. And then I  would point out another disadvantage. You would have to call away from  the performance of their duties in India a large body of men whose  duties ought to occupy, and I believe do occupy, all their minds and  all their time. Still it is an idea, and I will only say that I do not  entirely banish it from my own mind. Two interesting speeches, and  significant speeches, have been made this afternoon. One was made by  my hon. friend, the mover, and the other by the hon. Member for East  Leeds. Those two speeches raise a really important issue. My hon.  friend the Member for Leeds said that democracy was entirely opposed  to, and would resist, the doctrine of the settled fact.[1] My hon.  friend tells you democracy will have nothing to do with settled facts,  though he did not quite put it as plainly as that. Now, if that be so,  I am very sorry for democracy. I do not agree with my hon. friend. I  think democracy will be just as reasonable as any other sensible form  of government, and I do not believe democracy will for a moment  think that you are to rip up a settlement of an administrative or  constitutional question, because it jars with some abstract _a priori_  idea. I for one certainly say that I would not remain at the India  Office, or any other powerful and responsible Departmental office, on  condition that I made short work of settled facts, hurried on with my  catalogue of first principles, and arranged on those principles  the whole duties of government. Then my hon. friend the Member for  Brentford quoted an expression of mine used in a speech in the country  about the impatient idealists, and he reproved me for saying that some  of the worst tragedies of history had been wrought by the impatient  idealists. He was kind enough to say that it was I, among other  people, who had made him an idealist, and therefore I ought not to be  ashamed of my spiritual and intellectual progeny. I certainly have no  right whatever to say that I am ashamed of my hon. friend, who made  a speech full of interesting views, full of visions of a millennial  future, and I do not quarrel with him for making his speech. My hon.  friend said that he was for an Imperial Duma. The hon. Gentleman has  had the advantage of a visit to India, which I have never had. I think  he was there for six whole long weeks. He polished off the Indian  population at the heroic rate of sixty millions a week, and this makes  him our especially competent instructor. His Imperial Duma was to be  elected, as I understood, by universal suffrage.    [Footnote 1: The Secretary of State had on an earlier occasion spoken  of the Petition of Bengal as a settled fact.]    Dr. RUTHERFORD: No, not universal suffrage. I said educational  suffrage, and also pecuniary suffrage--taxpayers and ratepayers.    Mr. MORLEY: In the same speech the hon. Gentleman made a great charge  against our system of education in India--that we had not educated  them at all; therefore, he excludes at once an enormous part of the  population. The Imperial Duma, as I understood from my hon. friend was  to be subject to the veto of the Viceroy. That is not democracy. We  are to send out from Great Britain once in five years a Viceroy,  who is to be confronted by an Imperial Duma, just as the Tsar is  confronted by the Duma in Russia. Surely that is not a very ripe idea  of democracy. My hon. friend visited the State of Baroda, and thought  it well governed. Well, there is no Duma of his sort there. I will  state frankly my own opinion even though I have not spent one single  week-end in India. If I had to frame a new system of government for  India, I declare I would multiply the Baroda system of government,  rather than have an Imperial Duma and universal suffrage. The speech  of my hon. friend, with whom I am sorry to find myself, not in  collision but in difference, illustrates what is to my mind one of the  grossest of all the fallacies in practical politics--namely, that you  can cut out, frame, and shape one system of government for communities  with absolutely different sets of social, religious, and economic  conditions--that you can cut them all out by a sort of standardised  pattern, and say that what is good for us here, the point of view, the  line of argument, the method of solution--that all these things are to  be applied right off to a community like India. I must tell my hon.  friend that I regard that as a most fatal and mischievous fallacy, and  I need not say more. I am bound, after what I have said, to add that I  do not think that it is at all involved in Liberalism. I have had the  great good fortune and honour and privilege to have known some of the  great Liberals of my time, and there was not one of those great men,  Gambetta, Bright, Gladstone, Mazzini, who would have accepted for one  single moment the doctrine on which my hon. friend really bases his  visionary proposition for a Duma. Is there any rational man who  holds that, if you can lay down political principles and maxims  of government that apply equally to Scotland or to England, or to  Ireland, or to France, or to Spain, therefore they must be just as  true for the Punjab"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#8)"],[1,"siness; and, in fact, the tutor and employer of the predatory  urchins. His activity in preventing the boy from being taken back to  the shop--his anxiety to promote a subscription for the boy,--and,  lastly, his threat of personal violence if I interfered in the matter,  by continuing to question the child,--all these circumstances confirm  me in the opinion.    It is only by the knowledge of this fact--the association of infant  offenders with those of maturer and hardened habits--that we can  account for such cases as the following.--On the 17th of July, 1823,  a child _only seven years old_, was brought before the magistrate at  Lambeth Street office, charged with frequently robbing his mother,  and was ordered to be locked up all night in the gaol-room. In the  evening, however, when his mother returned, he forced his way out of  the room, and behaved with such violence that the attendants were  obliged to iron both his hands and legs! There can be no doubt that  this child had been for a long time under the instruction and evil  influence of some old and hardened offender; he must, indeed, have  undergone much training before he could have arrived at such a pitch  of hardihood, as to make it necessary to handcuff and fetter a child  of so tender an age; and to enable him to hold even the magistrates,  officers, and his own parent, at defiance.    The following cases afford further proof of the same lamentable truth;  the first is extracted from a morning paper of the 20th of September,  1824. \"A little boy, not more than _six years of age_, was brought  before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House, on Saturday, the 18th  instant, having been found in a warehouse, where he had secreted  himself for the purpose of thieving. At a late hour on Friday night,  a watchman was going his round, when, on trying a warehouse in which  there was much valuable property, to see whether it was safe, he heard  the little prisoner cry. The persons who had the care of the warehouse  were roused, and he was taken out. In his fright he acknowledged that  a man had taken him from his mother, and induced him, upon a promise  of reward, to steal into the warehouse; upon a concerted signal, he  was to act as directed by the fellow on the outside; but becoming  terrified at being confined so long in the dark, he had cried out  and discovered himself. His mother came forward, and received a good  character as the wife of a hard-working man. The Lord Mayor gave her  son up to her, with an injunction to act carefully and strictly with  him. There was reason to believe, he said, that several considerable  robberies had been recently committed by means of children like the  prisoner, who stole in and remained concealed until midnight, when  they gave admission to the robbers. The police should have their eyes  upon him.\"    The other instance is from a report of one of the sessions in  London:--    \"William Hart, an urchin _seven years of age_, was indicted for  stealing twenty-two shillings in money, numbered, from the person of  Mary Conner. The prosecutrix stated, that on the day named in the  indictment, she took twenty-five shillings to get something out of  pledge, but as there was a crowd in Mary-le-bone, assembled to witness  a fight, she was induced to join the mob. While standing there she  felt something move in her pocket, and putting her hand outside her  clothes, she laid hold of what proved to be the hand of the prisoner,  which she held until she had given him a slap on the face, and then  she let him go; but on feeling in her pocket she discovered that the  theft had actually been committed, and that only three shillings were  left. A constable took the urchin into custody, and accused him of  robbing her of twenty-two shillings. The prisoner said, 'I have  twenty-two shillings in my pocket, but it is my mother's money; she  gets so drunk she gives me her money to take care of.' The officer  stated to the same effect as the prosecutrix, and added, that _in a  secret pocket in his jacket he found fourteen shilling and sixpence.  It was the practice of gangs of pickpockets to have a child like this  to commit the robbery, and hand the plunder to them_. Witness went to  his parents, who said he had been absent seven weeks, and they would  have nothing to do with him. Mr. Baron Garrow, in feeling terms,  lamented that a child of such tender years should be so depraved. He  added, 'I suppose, gentlemen, I need only to ask you to deliver your  verdict.' His lordship then observed, that he would consult with his  learned brother as to the best manner of disposing of the prisoner.  They at length decided, that although it might seem harsh, the court  would record against him fourteen years' transportation, and, no  doubt, government would place him in some school; if he behaved well  there, the sentence might not be carried into full effect.\"    I remember a query being once put to me by a person who visited the  Spitalfields Infant School at the time it was under my management:  \"How can you account for the fact, that notwithstanding there are so  many old and experienced thieves detected, convicted, and sent out of  the country every session, we cannot perceive any dimunition of the  numbers of such characters; but that others seem always to supply  their places?\" The foregoing instance of the systematized instruction  of young delinquents by old adepts in the art of pilfering, affords, I  think, a satisfactory answer the interrogatory.    The dexterity of experienced thieves shews, that no small degree of  care and attention is bestowed on their tuition. The first task of  novices, I have been informed, is to go in companies of threes or  fours, through the respectable streets and squares of the metropolis,  and with an old knife, or a similar instrument, to wrench off the  brass-work usually placed over the key-holes of the area-gates, &c.,  which they sell at the marine store-shops; and they are said sometimes  to realize three or four shillings a day, by this means. Wishing to  be satisfied on the point, I have walked round many of the squares in  town, and in more than a solitary experiment, have found that _not one  gate in ten_ had any brass-work over the key-hole; it had moreover  been evidently wrenched off,--a small piece of the brass still  remaining on many of the gates. Having practised this branch of the  profession a considerable time, and become adepts in its execution,  the next step, I have been informed, is to steal the handles and brass  knockers from doors, which is done by taking out the screw with a  small screw-driver: these are disposed of in the same manner as the  former things, till the young pilferers are progressively qualified  for stealing brass weights, &c., and at length, become expert thieves.    The following fact will shew what extensive depredations young  children are capable of committing. I have inserted the whole as  it appeared in the public papers:--\"_Union Hall_; _Shop  Lifting_.--Yesterday, two little girls, sisters, very neatly dressed,  _one nine_, and the _other seven, years of age_, were put to the bar,  charged by Mr. Cornell, linen-draper, of High Street, Newington; with  having stolen a piece of printed calico, from the corner of his shop.    \"Mr. Cornell stated, that the children came to his shop, yesterday  morning; and while he was engaged with his customers at the further  end of the shop, he happened to cast his eyes where the prisoners  were, and observed the oldest roll up a large piece of printed calico,  and put it into a basket, which her little sister carried: the witness  immediately advanced to her, and asked if she had taken any thing  from off the counter; but she positively asserted that she had not.  However, on searching her basket, the calico was found; together with  a piece of muslin, which Mr. Cornell identified as belonging to him,  and to have been taken in the above way. Mr. Allen questioned the  eldest girl about the robbery, but she positively denied any knowledge  as to how, or in what manner, the calico and muslin had got into her  basket, frequently appealing to her little sister to confirm the truth  of what she declared. When asked if she had ever been charged with any  offence, she replied, 'O yes, sir, some time back I was accused of  stealing a watch from a house, but I did not do it.' The magistrate  observed, that the father should be made acquainted with the  circumstance, and, in the mean time, gave the gaoler instructions that  the two little delinquents should be taken care of.    \"Hall, the officer, stated that he had information that there was a  quantity of goods, which had been stolen by the prisoners, concealed  in a certain desk in the house of the father; and that a great deal of  stolen property would, in all probability, be found there, if a search  warrant were granted, as the two unfortunate children were believed to  be most extensive depredators.    \"Mr. Allen immediately granted the warrant; and Hall, accompanied by  Mr. Cornell, proceeded to the residence of the father of the children,  who is an auctioneer and appraiser, at 12, Lyon Street, Newington.    \"Hall returned in half an hour with the father in his custody, and  produced a great quantity of black silk handkerchiefs, which he had  found on the premises; but the desk, which had been spoken of by his  informers as containing stolen property, he had found quite empty.  The father, when questioned by the witness as to whether he had any  duplicates of property in his possession, positively denied that fact.  At the office he was searched, and about fifty duplicates were found  in his pockets, most of which were for silk handkerchiefs and shawls.  There were also a few rings, for the possession of which the prisoner  could not satisfactorily account. He was asked why he had assured the  officer he had no duplicates? He replied, that he had not said so;  but Mr."]]]
