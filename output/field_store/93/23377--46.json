Modern  sanitation in Cuba has made yellow fever a remote possibility, and the  drinking water in Havana is as pure as any in the world.    Most of the official descriptions of the flora of Cuba appear to be copied  from Robert T. Hill's book, published in 1898. As nothing better is  available, it may be used here. He says: \"The surface of the island is clad  in a voluptuous floral mantle, which, from its abundance and beauty, first  caused Cuba to be designated the Pearl of the Antilles. In addition  to those introduced from abroad, over 3,350 native plants have been  catalogued. The flora includes nearly all characteristic forms of the  other West Indies, the southern part of Florida, and the Central American  seaboard. Nearly all the large trees of the Mexican _Tierra Caliente_, so  remarkable for their size, foliage, and fragrance, reappear in western  Cuba. Numerous species of palm, including the famous royal palm, occur,  while the pine trees, elsewhere characteristic of the temperate zone and  the high altitudes of the tropics, are found associated with palms and  mahoganies in the province of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Pines, both  of which take their name from this tree. Among other woods are the  lignum-vitae, granadilla, the coco-wood, and the _Cedrela Odorata_  (fragrant cedar) which is used for cigar boxes and the lining of cabinet  work.\"    In quoting the number of native plants, Mr. Hill uses a report somewhat  antiquated. Later estimates place the number as between five and six  thousand. Flowers are abundant, flowers on vines, plants, shrubs, and  trees, tall stalks with massive heads, and dainty little blossoms by the  wayside. Brilliant flowering trees are planted to line the roadsides. Among  all the tree-growths, the royal palm is notable. Scoffers have likened it  to \"a feather duster stood on end,\" but it is the prominent feature in most  of Cuba's landscape, and it serves many purposes other than that of mere  decoration. From its stem the Cuban peasant builds his little cottage which  he roofs with its leaves. Medicinal qualities are claimed for its roots.  From different parts of the tree, a wide variety of useful articles is  made, plates, buckets, basins, and even a kettle in which water may be  boiled. The huge clusters of seeds are excellent food for animals, and I  have heard it said, though without proper confirmation, that \"a royal palm  will keep a hog.\" Almost invariably, its presence indicates a rich soil, as  it rarely grows in areas of poor land. The forest area of the island is not  known with exactness, and is variously estimated at from about six thousand  square miles to about sixteen thousand. The difference probably represents  the opinion of individual investigators as to what is forest. About  one-third of the total is reported as in Oriente, another third in  Camaguey, and the remainder scattered through the four remaining provinces.  A part of it is \"public land,\" that is, owned by the central government,  but a greater part is of private ownership under old Spanish grants. Much  of it is dense jungle through which a way can be made only by hacking,  almost foot by foot. A good deal of it has already been cut over for its  most valuable timber. Most of the woods bear names entirely unfamiliar to  us. Some are used as cabinet woods, and some for tanning, for oils, dyes,  gums, or fibres.    Cuba has few four-footed native wild animals. There are rabbits, but their  nativity is not quite certain. There are deer, but it is known that their  ancestors were brought from some other country. There are wild dogs, wild  cats, and wild pigs, but all are only domestic animals run wild.    Perhaps the only animal of the kind known to be native is the _jutia_,  sometimes spelled, as pronounced, _hutia_. Some observers have referred to  it as a rat, but it climbs trees and grows to the size of a woodchuck,  or groundhog. It is sometimes eaten and is said to be quite palatable.  Reptiles are fairly common, but none of them is dangerous. The best known  is the _maja_, a snake that grows to a length, sometimes, of twelve or  fifteen feet. The country people not infrequently make of it a kind of  house pet. When that is done, the reptile often makes its home in the  cottage thatch, living on birds and mice. They are dull and sluggish in  motion. While visiting a sugar plantation a few years ago one of the hands  asked if I should be interested by their _maja_. He dipped his hand into a  nearby water-barrel in the bottom of which two of them were closely coiled.  He dragged out one of perhaps ten or twelve feet in length and four or five  inches in diameter, handling it as he would the same length of hawser. He  hung it over the limb of a tree so that I could have a good chance for  a picture of it. The thing squirmed slowly to the ground and crawled  sluggishly away to the place from which it had been taken. Of bird-life  there is a large representation, both native and migratory. Among them  are some fifty species of \"waders.\" In some parts of the island, the very  unpleasant land-crab, about the size of a soup-plate, seems to exist in  millions, although thousands is probably nearer the actual. The American  soldiers made their acquaintance in large numbers at the time of the  Santiago campaign. They are not a proper article of food. They have a  salt-water relative that is most excellent eating, as is also the lobster  _(langosta)_ of Cuban waters. In the swamp known as the Cienega de Zapata  are both alligators and crocodiles, some of them of quite imposing  dimensions.    [Illustration: ROYAL PALMS]    The insect life of the island is extensive. From personal experience,  particularly behind the search-light of an automobile that drew them  in swarms, I, should say that the island would be a rich field for the  entomologist. There are mosquitos, gnats, beetles, moths, butterflies,  spiders, and scorpions. The bites of some of the spiders and the stings of  the scorpions are, of course, uncomfortable, but they are neither fatal nor  dangerous. With the exception of an occasional mosquito, and a perhaps more  than occasional flea, the visitor to cities only is likely to encounter  few of the members of these branches of Cuban zoology. There is one of  the beetle family, however, that is extremely interesting. That is  the _cucullo_, which Mr. Hazard, in his book on Cuba, calls a \"bright  peripatetic candle-bearer, by whose brilliant light one can not only walk,  but even read.\" They are really a kind of glorified firefly, much larger  than ours, and with a much more brilliant light. I do not know their  candle-power, but Mr. Hazard exaggerates little if at all in the matter of  their brilliancy.    While those referred to in the foregoing are the most notable features  in this particular part of the Cuban field, there are others, though of  perhaps less importance, to which reference might be made. Among them would  be the sponge fisheries of the coast in the neighborhood of Batabano,  and the numerous mineral springs, some of them really having, and others  supposed to have, remarkable curative qualities. A half century or so ago,  a number of places not far from Havana were resorts to which rich and  poor went to drink or to bathe in springs hot or cold or sulphurous or  otherwise, for their healing. Among these were the baths at San Diego, near  the Organ Mountains in Pinar del Rio; Santa Rita, near Guanabacoa in Havana  Province; others near Marianao, on the outskirts of the city; and San  Antonio, also in Havana Province. Most of these places now appear to have  lost their popularity if not their medicinal virtues. Some, like those  at Madruga, not far from Havana, still have a considerable patronage.  Something may also be said of earthquakes and hurricanes. The former  occur, on a small scale, more or less frequently in Oriente, and much less  frequently and of less severity in Havana. The latter come from time  to time to work disaster to Cuban industries and, sometimes but not  frequently, to cause loss of life and the destruction of buildings. They  rarely occur except in the late summer and the autumn.    Nearly a hundred years ago, Alexander Humboldt, a traveller and a  scientist, wrote thus of the island of Cuba: \"Notwithstanding the absence  of deep rivers and the unequal fertility of the soil, the island of Cuba  presents on every hand a most varied and agreeable country from its  undulating character, its ever-springing verdure, and the variety of its  vegetable formations.\"          IV    _THE OLD HAVANA_      Among the many pictures, stored away in the album of my memory, there are  two that stand out more vividly than any others. The subjects are separated  by half the world's circumference. One is the sunsets at Jolo, in the  southern Philippines. There the sun sank into the western sea in a blaze  of cloud-glory, between the low-lying islands on either hand with the rich  green of their foliage turned to purple shadows. The other is the sunrise  at Havana, seen from the deck of a steamer in the harbor. The long, soft  shadows and the mellow light fell on the blue and gray and green of the  buildings of the city, and on the red-tiled roofs, with the hills for a  background in one-half of the picture, and the gleaming water of the gulf  in the background of the other half. I had seen the long stretch of the  southern coast of the island, from Cape Antonio to Cape Maisi, while on an  excursion with a part of the army of occupation sent to Porto Rico in the  summer of 1898, and had set foot on Cuban soil at Daiquiri, but Havana in  the morning light, on January 2, 1899, was my first real Cuban experience.  It remains an ineffaceable memory. Of my surroundings and experiences aside"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11487"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The latter was, probably, the  case: for in the same breath in which he declares \"his life, even his  early life, to have been pure,\" he sues for pardon at the hands of his  Maker, and acknowledges a Redeemer, as the instrument through which he  is to obtain it.    That quickness of feeling and disposition to abandon himself to  its guidance, which made Parr an inconsistent man, made him also a  benevolent one. Benevolence he loved as a subject for his contemplation,  and the practical extension of it as a rule for his conduct. He could  scarcely bear to regard the Deity under any other aspect. He would have  children taught, in the first instance, to regard him under that aspect  alone; simply as a being who displayed infinite goodness in the  creation, in the government, and in the redemption of the world.  Language itself indicates, that the whole system of moral rectitude is  comprised in it--_[Greek: energetein], benefacere_, beneficencethe  generic term being, in common parlance, emphatically restricted to works  of charity. Nor was this mere theory in Parr. Most men who have been  economical from necessity in their youth, continue to be so, from habit,  in their age--but Parr's hand was ever open as day. Poverty had vexed,  but had never contracted his spirit; money he despised, except as it  gave him power--power to ride in his state coach, to throw wide his  doors to hospitality, to load his table with plate, and his shelves with  learning; power to adorn his church with chandeliers and painted  windows; to make glad the cottages of his poor; to grant a loan, to a  tottering farmer; to rescue from want a forlorn patriot, or a thriftless  scholar. Whether misfortune, or mismanagement, or folly, or vice, had  brought its victim low, his want was a passport to Parr's pity, and the  dew of his bounty fell alike upon the evil and the good, upon the just  and the unjust. It is told of Boerhaave, that, whenever he saw a  criminal led out to execution, he would say, \"May not this man be better  than I? If otherwise, the praise is due, not to me, but to the grace of  God.\" Parr quotes the saying with applause. Such, we doubt not, would  have been his own feelings on such an occasion.--_Quarterly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER        A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.

The celebrated scholar, Muretus, was taken ill upon the road as he was  travelling from Paris to Lyons, and as his appearance was not much in  his favour, he was carried to an hospital. Two physicians attended him,  and his disease not being a very common one, they thought it right to  try something new, and out of the usual road of practice, upon him.  One of them, not knowing that their patient knew Latin, said in that  language to the other, \"We may surely venture to try an experiment upon  the body of so mean a man as our patient is.\" \"Mean, sir!\" replied  Muretus, in Latin, to their astonishment, \"can you pretend to call any  man so, sir, for whom the Saviour of the world did not think it beneath  him to die?\"    IRELAND.
