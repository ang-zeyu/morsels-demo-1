[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"lund_. (Pages 5 to 8.)    Dr. Rydberg formulates a theory identifying Voelund with Thiazi,  the giant who carried off Idunn. It is based chiefly on arguments  from names and other philological considerations, and gives perhaps  undue weight to the authority of Saxo. It is difficult to see any  fundamental likenesses in the stories.    The Old English references to Weland are in the _Waldere_ fragment  and the _Lament of Deor_. For the Franks Casket, see Professor  Napier's discussion, with photographs, in the _English Miscellany_  (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1901). The _Thidreks Saga_ (sometimes  called _Vilkina Saga_), was edited by Unger (Christiania, 1853),  and by Hylten-Cavallius (1880). There are two German translations:  by Rassmann (_Heldensage,_ (1863), and by Von der Hagen (_Nordische  Heldenromane_, 1873).    _The Volsungs_. (Pages 8 to 27.)    As divided in most editions the poems connected with the Volsung cycle,  including the two on Ermanric, are fifteen in number:    _Gripisspa_.    _Reginsmal, Fafnismal, Sigrdrifumal_, a continued narrative compiled  from different sources.    _Sigurd Fragment_, on the death of Sigurd.    _First Gudrun Lay_, on Gudrun's mourning, late.    _Short Sigurd Lay_ (called _Long Brynhild Lay_ in the _Corpus  Poeticum_; sometimes called _Third Sigurd Lay_). style late.    _Brynhild's Hellride_, a continuation of the preceding.    _Second_, or _Old, Gudrun Lay_, is also late. It contains more kennings  than are usual in Eddic poetry, and the picture of Gudrun's sojourn in  Denmark and the tapestry she wrought with Thora Halfdan's daughter,  together with the descriptions of her suitors, belong to a period  which had a taste for colour and elaboration of detail.    _Third Gudrun Lay_, or the _Ordeal of Gudrun_ (after her marriage to  Atli), is romantic in character. The Gothic hero Thjodrek (Dietrich)  is introduced.    _Oddrun's Lament_, in which Gunnar's death is caused by an intrigue  with Atli's sister Oddrun, marks the disintegration of the Volsung  legend.    The two Atli Lays _(Atlakvida_ and _Atlamal_, the latter of Greenland  origin), deal with the death of Gunnar and Hoegni, and Gudrun's  vengeance on Atli.    _Gudrun's Lament_ and _Hamthismal_ belong to the Ermanric cycle.    _Volsung Paraphrases_. (Page 11.)    _Skaldskaparmal, Voelsunga Saga_ and _Norna-Gests Thattr_  (containing  another short paraphrase) are all included in Dr. Wilken's _Die  Prosaische Edda_ (Paderborn, 1878). There is an English version of  _Voelsunga_ by Magnusson and Morris (London, 1870) and a German version  of _Voelsunga_  and _Norna-Gest_ by Edzardi.    _Nibelungenlied_.  (Page 11.)    Editions by Bartsch (Leipzig, 1895) and Zarncke (Halle, 1899);  translation into modern German by Simrock.    _Signy and Siggeir_.  (Page 13.)    Saxo Grammaticus (Book vii.) tells the story of a Signy, daughter  of Sigar, whose lover Hagbard, after slaying her brothers, wins her  favour. Sigar in vengeance had him strangled on a hill in view of  Signy's windows, and she set fire to her house that she might die  simultaneously with her lover. The antiquity of part at least of this  story is proved by the kenning \"Hagbard's collar\" for halter, in a  poem probably of the tenth century. On the other hand, a reference  in _Voelsunga Saga_, that \"Haki and Hagbard were great and famous  men, yet Sigar carried off their sister, ... and they were slow to  vengeance,\" shows that there is confusion somewhere. It seems possible  that Hagbard's story has been contaminated with a distorted account  of the Volsung Signy, civilised as usual by Saxo, with an effect of  vulgarity absent from the primitive story.    In a recently published pamphlet by Mr. W.W. Lawrence and  Dr. W.H. Schofield (_The First Riddle of Cynewulf_ and _Signy's  Lament_. Baltimore: The Modern Language Association of America. 1902)  it is suggested that the so-called First Riddle in the Exeter Book  is in reality an Anglo-Saxon translation of a Norse \"Complaint\"  spoken by the Volsung Signy. Evidence from metre and form is all in  favour of this view, and the poem bears the interpretation without any  straining of the meaning. Dr. Schofield's second contention, that the  poem thus interpreted is evidence for the theory of a British origin  for the Eddie poems, is not equally convincing. The existence in  Anglo-Saxon of a translation from the Norse is no proof that any  of the Eddie poems, or even the original Norse \"Signy's Lament\"  postulated by Dr. Schofield, were composed in the West.    It seems unnecessary to suppose, with Dr. Schofield, an influence of  British legend on the Volsung story. The points in which the story  of Sigmund resembles that of Arthur and differs from that of Theseus  prove nothing in the face of equally strong points of correspondence  between Arthur and Theseus which are absent from the Volsung story.    _Sinfjoetli's Death_. (Page 14.)    Munch (_Nordmaendenes Gudelaere_, Christiania, 1847) ingeniously  identified the old man with Odin, come in person to conduct Sinfjoetli  to Valhalla, since he would otherwise have gone to Hel, not having  fallen in battle; a stratagem quite in harmony with Odin's traditional  character.    _Sigmund and Sinfjoetli_. (Page 15.)    It seems probable, on the evidence of _Beowulf_, that Sigmund and  Sinfjoetli represent the Pan-Germanic stage of the national-hero, and  Sigurd or Siegfried the Continental stage. Possibly Helgi may then be  the Norse race-hero. Sigurd was certainly foreign to Scandinavia; hence  the epithet Hunnish, constantly applied to him, and the localising  of the legend by the Rhine. The possibility suggests itself that the  Brynhild part of the story, on the other hand, is of Scandinavian  origin, and thence passed to Germany. It is at least curious that  the _Nibelungen Lied_  places Prunhilt in Iceland.    _Wagner and the Volsung Cycle_. (Page 26.)    Wagner's _Ring des Nibelungen_ is remarkable not only for the way  in which it reproduces the spirit of both the Sinfjoetli and the  Sigurd traditions, but also for the wonderful instinct which chooses  the best and most primitive features of both Norse and Continental  versions. Thus he keeps the dragon of the Norse, the Nibelungs of  the German; preserves the wildness of the old Sigmund tale, and  substitutes the German Hagen for his paler Norse namesake; restores  the original balance between the parts of Brynhild and Gudrun; gives  the latter character, and an active instead of a passive function  in the story, by assigning to her her mother's share in the action;  and by substituting for the slaying of the otter the bargain with  the Giants for the building of Valhalla, makes the cause worthy of  the catastrophe.    _Ermanric_. (Page 27.)    For examples of legend becoming attached to historical names, see  Tylor's _Primitive Culture_.    _The Helgi Lays_. (Page 29.)    The Helgi Lays stand before the Volsung set in the MS.; I treat them  later for the sake of greater clearness.    _Helgi and Kara_. (Page 30.)    _Hromundar Saga Gripssonar_, in which this story is given, is worthless  as literature, and has not been recently edited. P.E. Mueller's  _Sagabibliothek_, in which it was published, is out of print. Latin and  Swedish translations may be found in Bjoerner's _Nordiske Kampa Dater_  (Stockholm, 1737), also out of print.    _Rebirth_. (Page 31.)    Dr. Storm has an interesting article on the Norse belief in Re-birth in  the _Arkiv for Nordisk Filologi_, ix. He collects instances, and among  other arguments points out the Norse custom of naming a posthumous  child after its dead father as a probable relic of the belief. The  inheritance of luck may perhaps be another survival; a notable instance  occurs in _Viga-Glums Saga_, where the warrior Vigfus bequeaths his  luck to his favourite grandson, Glum. In the _Waterdale Saga_ there  are two instances in which it is stated that the luck of the dead  grandfather will pass to the grandson who receives his name. Scholars  do not, however, agree as to the place of the rebirth idea in the Helgi  poems, some holding the view that it is an essential part of the story.    _Hunding_. (Page 32.)    It is possible that the werwolf story is a totem survival. If so,  the Hunding feud might easily belong to it: dogs are the natural  enemies of wolves. It is curious that the Irish werwolf Cormac has  a feud with MacCon (_i.e._, Son of a Dog), which means the same as  Hunding. This story, which has not been printed, will be found in  the Bodleian MS. Laud, 610.    _Thorgerd Holgabrud_.  (Page 33.)    Told in Saxo, Book ii. Snorri has a bare allusion to it.    _Holger Danske, or Ogier Le Danois_. (Page 33.)    See _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_, vol. i. p. cxxx., and No. 10 of this  series. The Norse version of the story (Helgi Thorisson) is told in  the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, and is summarised by Dr. Rydberg in the  _Teutonic Mythology_, and by Mr. Nutt in the _Voyage of Bran_.    _Ballads_. (Page 36.)    Professor Child is perhaps hasty in regarding the two parts of _Clerk  Saunders_ as independent. The first part, though unlike the Helgi  story in circumstance, seems to preserve the tradition of the hero's  hostility to his bride's kindred, and his death at their hands.    The Helgi story, in all its variants, is as familiar in Danish as in  Border ballads. The distribution of the material in Iceland, Denmark,  England and Scotland is strongly in favour of the presumption that  Scandinavian legend influenced England and Scotland, and against the  presumption that the poems in question passed from the British Isles  to Iceland. The evidence of the Danish ballads should be conclusive  on this point. There is an English translation of the latter by  R.C.A. Prior (_Ancient Danish Ballads_, London, 1860).    _The Everlasting Battle_. (Page 39.)    The Skald Bragi (before 850 A.D.) has a poem on this subject,  given with a translation in the _Corpus_, vol. ii.

Such is the story of the miracle, translated from a small ill-printed  pamphlet sold by the priests of the temple, all the decorations of  which, even to a bronze lantern in the middle of the yard, are in the  form of a cuttlefish, the sacred emblem of the place.    What pleasanter lounge in which to while away a hot day could a man  wish for than the shade of the trees borne by the hill on which stands  the Temple of Fudo Sama? Two jets of pure water springing from the  rock are voided by spouts carved in the shape of dragons into a stone  basin enclosed by rails, within which it is written that \"no woman may  enter.\" If you are in luck, you may cool yourself by watching some  devotee, naked save his loin-cloth, performing the ceremony called  _Suigiyo_; that is to say, praying under the waterfall that his soul  may be purified through his body. In winter it requires no small pluck  to go through this penance, yet I have seen a penitent submit to it  for more than a quarter of an hour on a bitterly cold day in January.  In summer, on the other hand, the religious exercise called  _Hiyakudo_, or \"the hundred times,\" which may also be seen here to  advantage, is no small trial of patience. It consists in walking  backwards and forwards a hundred times between two points within the  sacred precincts, repeating a prayer each time. The count is kept  either upon the fingers or by depositing a length of twisted straw  each time that the goal is reached; at this temple the place allotted  for the ceremony is between a grotesque bronze figure of Tengu Sama  (\"the Dog of Heaven\"), the terror of children, a most hideous monster  with a gigantic nose, which it is beneficial to rub with a finger  afterwards to be applied to one's own nose, and a large brown box  inscribed with the characters _Hiyaku Do_ in high relief, which may  generally be seen full of straw tallies. It is no sinecure to be a  good Buddhist, for the gods are not lightly to be propitiated. Prayer  and fasting, mortification of the flesh, abstinence from wine, from  women, and from favourite dishes, are the only passports to rising in  office, prosperity in trade, recovery from sickness, or a happy  marriage with a beloved maiden. Nor will mere faith without works be  efficient. A votive tablet of proportionate value to the favour prayed  for, or a sum of money for the repairs of the shrine or temple, is  necessary to win the favour of the gods. Poorer persons will cut off  the queue of their hair and offer that up; and at Horinouchi, a temple  in great renown some eight or nine miles from Yedo, there is a rope  about two inches and a half in diameter and about six fathoms long,  entirely made of human hair so given to the gods; it lies coiled up,  dirty, moth-eaten, and uncared for, at one end of a long shed full of  tablets and pictures, by the side of a rude native fire-engine. The  taking of life being displeasing to Buddha, outside many of the  temples old women and children earn a livelihood by selling sparrows,  small eels, carp, and tortoises, which the worshipper sets free in  honour of the deity, within whose territory cocks and hens and doves,  tame and unharmed, perch on every jutty, frieze, buttress, and coigne  of vantage.    But of all the marvellous customs that I wot of in connection with  Japanese religious exercises, none appears to me so strange as that of  spitting at the images of the gods, more especially at the statues of  the Ni-o, the two huge red or red and green statues which, like Gog  and Magog, emblems of strength, stand as guardians of the chief  Buddhist temples. The figures are protected by a network of iron wire,  through which the votaries, praying the while, spit pieces of paper,  which they had chewed up into a pulp. If the pellet sticks to the  statue, the omen is favourable; if it falls, the prayer is not  accepted. The inside of the great bell at the Tycoon's burial-ground,  and almost every holy statue throughout the country, are all covered  with these outspittings from pious mouths.[11]    [Footnote 11: It will be readily understood that the customs and  ceremonies to which I have alluded belong only to the gross  superstitions with which ignorance has overlaid that pure Buddhism of  which Professor Max Mueller has pointed out the very real beauties.]    [Illustration: THE TOMB OF THE SHIYOKU.]    Through all this discourse about temples and tea-houses, I am coming  by degrees to the goal of our pilgrimage--two old stones, mouldering  away in a rank, overgrown graveyard hard by, an old old  burying-ground, forgotten by all save those who love to dig out the  tales of the past. The key is kept by a ghoulish old dame, almost as  time-worn and mildewed as the tomb over which she watches. Obedient to  our call, and looking forward to a fee ten times greater than any  native would give her, she hobbles out, and, opening the gate, points  out the stone bearing the inscription, the \"Tomb of the Shiyoku\"  (fabulous birds, which, living one within the other--a mysterious  duality contained in one body--are the emblem of connubial love and  fidelity). By this stone stands another, graven with a longer legend,  which runs as follows:--    \"In the old days of Genroku, she pined for the beauty of her lover,  who was as fair to look upon as the flowers; and now beneath the moss  of this old tombstone all has perished of her save her name. Amid the  changes of a fitful world, this tomb is decaying under the dew and  rain; gradually crumbling beneath its own dust, its outline alone  remains. Stranger! bestow an alms to preserve this stone; and we,  sparing neither pain nor labour, will second you with all our hearts.  Erecting it again, let us preserve it from decay for future  generations, and let us write the following verse upon it:--'These two  birds, beautiful as the cherry-blossoms, perished before their time,  like flowers broken down by the wind before they have borne seed.'\"    Under the first stone is the dust of Gompachi, robber and murderer,  mixed with that of his true love Komurasaki, who lies buried with him.  Her sorrows and constancy have hallowed the place, and pious people  still come to burn incense and lay flowers before the grave. How she  loved him even in death may be seen from the following old-world  story.           *       *       *       *       *    About two hundred and thirty years ago there lived in the service of a  daimio of the province of Inaba a young man, called Shirai Gompachi,  who, when he was but sixteen years of age, had already won a name for  his personal beauty and valour, and for his skill in the use of arms.  Now it happened that one day a dog belonging to him fought with  another dog belonging to a fellow-clansman, and the two masters, being  both passionate youths, disputing as to whose dog had had the best of  the fight, quarrelled and came to blows, and Gompachi slew his  adversary; and in consequence of this he was obliged to flee from his  country, and make his escape to Yedo.    And so Gompachi set out on his travels.    One night, weary and footsore, he entered what appeared to him to be a  roadside inn, ordered some refreshment, and went to bed, little  thinking of the danger that menaced him: for as luck would have it,  this inn turned out to be the trysting-place of a gang of robbers,  into whose clutches he had thus unwittingly fallen. To be sure,  Gompachi's purse was but scantily furnished, but his sword and dirk  were worth some three hundred ounces of silver, and upon these the  robbers (of whom there were ten) had cast envious eyes, and had  determined to kill the owner for their sake; but he, all unsuspicious,  slept on in fancied security.    In the middle of the night he was startled from his deep slumbers by  some one stealthily opening the sliding door which led into his room,  and rousing himself with an effort, he beheld a beautiful young girl,  fifteen years of age, who, making signs to him not to stir, came up to  his bedside, and said to him in a whisper--    \"Sir, the master of this house is the chief of a gang of robbers, who  have been plotting to murder you this night for the sake of your  clothes and your sword. As for me, I am the daughter of a rich  merchant in Mikawa: last year the robbers came to our house, and  carried off my father's treasure and myself. I pray you, sir, take me  with you, and let us fly from this dreadful place.\"    She wept as she spoke, and Gompachi was at first too much startled to  answer; but being a youth of high courage and a cunning fencer to  boot, he soon recovered his presence of mind, and determined to kill  the robbers, and to deliver the girl out of their hands. So he  replied--    \"Since you say so, I will kill these thieves, and rescue you this very  night; only do you, when I begin the fight, run outside the house,  that you may be out of harm's way, and remain in hiding until I join  you.\"    Upon this understanding the maiden left him, and went her way. But he  lay awake, holding his breath and watching; and when the thieves crept  noiselessly into the room, where they supposed him to be fast asleep,  he cut down the first man that entered, and stretched him dead at his  feet. The other nine, seeing this, laid about them with their drawn  swords, but Gompachi, fighting with desperation, mastered them at  last, and slew them. After thus ridding himself of his enemies, he  went outside the house and called to the girl, who came running to his  side, and joyfully travelled on with him to Mikawa, where her father  dwelt; and when they reached Mikawa, he took the maiden to the old  man's house, and told him how, when he had fallen among"]]]
