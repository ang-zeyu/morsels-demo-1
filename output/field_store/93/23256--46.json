As the tribe hunted, the glistening body of the ape-man mingled with  the brown, shaggy hides of his companions.   Oftentimes they brushed  together in passing, but the apes had already taken his presence for  granted, so that he was as much one of them as Akut himself.    If he came too close to a she with a young baby, the former would bare  her great fighting fangs and growl ominously, and occasionally a  truculent young bull would snarl a warning if Tarzan approached while  the former was eating.  But in those things the treatment was no  different from that which they accorded any other member of the tribe.    Tarzan on his part felt very much at home with these fierce, hairy  progenitors of primitive man.  He skipped nimbly out of reach of each  threatening female--for such is the way of apes, if they be not in one  of their occasional fits of bestial rage--and he growled back at the  truculent young bulls, baring his canine teeth even as they.  Thus  easily he fell back into the way of his early life, nor did it seem  that he had ever tasted association with creatures of his own kind.    For the better part of a week he roamed the jungle with his new  friends, partly because of a desire for companionship and partially  through a well-laid plan to impress himself indelibly upon their  memories, which at best are none too long; for Tarzan from past  experience knew that it might serve him in good stead to have a tribe  of these powerful and terrible beasts at his call.    When he was convinced that he had succeeded to some extent in fixing  his identity upon them he decided to again take up his exploration.  To  this end he set out toward the north early one day, and, keeping  parallel with the shore, travelled rapidly until almost nightfall.    When the sun rose the next morning he saw that it lay almost directly  to his right as he stood upon the beach instead of straight out across  the water as heretofore, and so he reasoned that the shore line had  trended toward the west.   All the second day he continued his rapid  course, and when Tarzan of the Apes sought speed, he passed through the  middle terrace of the forest with the rapidity of a squirrel.    That night the sun set straight out across the water opposite the land,  and then the ape-man guessed at last the truth that he had been  suspecting.    Rokoff had set him ashore upon an island.    He might have known it!  If there was any plan that would render his  position more harrowing he should have known that such would be the one  adopted by the Russian, and what could be more terrible than to leave  him to a lifetime of suspense upon an uninhabited island?    Rokoff doubtless had sailed directly to the mainland, where it would be  a comparatively easy thing for him to find the means of delivering the  infant Jack into the hands of the cruel and savage foster-parents, who,  as his note had threatened, would have the upbringing of the child.    Tarzan shuddered as he thought of the cruel suffering the little one  must endure in such a life, even though he might fall into the hands of  individuals whose intentions toward him were of the kindest.  The  ape-man had had sufficient experience with the lower savages of Africa  to know that even there may be found the cruder virtues of charity and  humanity; but their lives were at best but a series of terrible  privations, dangers, and sufferings.    Then there was the horrid after-fate that awaited the child as he grew  to manhood.  The horrible practices that would form a part of his  life-training would alone be sufficient to bar him forever from  association with those of his own race and station in life.    A cannibal!  His little boy a savage man-eater!  It was too horrible to  contemplate.    The filed teeth, the slit nose, the little face painted hideously.  Tarzan groaned.  Could he but feel the throat of the Russ fiend beneath  his steel fingers!    And Jane!    What tortures of doubt and fear and uncertainty she must be suffering.  He felt that his position was infinitely less terrible than hers, for  he at least knew that one of his loved ones was safe at home, while she  had no idea of the whereabouts of either her husband or her son.    It is well for Tarzan that he did not guess the truth, for the  knowledge would have but added a hundredfold to his suffering.    As he moved slowly through the jungle his mind absorbed by his gloomy  thoughts, there presently came to his ears a strange scratching sound  which he could not translate.    Cautiously he moved in the direction from which it emanated, presently  coming upon a huge panther pinned beneath a fallen tree.    As Tarzan approached, the beast turned, snarling, toward him,  struggling to extricate itself; but one great limb across its back and  the smaller entangling branches pinioning its legs prevented it from  moving but a few inches in any direction.    The ape-man stood before the helpless cat fitting an arrow to his bow  that he might dispatch the beast that otherwise must die of starvation;  but even as he drew back the shaft a sudden whim stayed his hand.    Why rob the poor creature of life and liberty, when it would be so easy  a thing to restore both to it!  He was sure from the fact that the  panther moved all its limbs in its futile struggle for freedom that its  spine was uninjured, and for the same reason he knew that none of its  limbs were broken.    Relaxing his bowstring, he returned the arrow to the quiver and,  throwing the bow about his shoulder, stepped closer to the pinioned  beast.    On his lips was the soothing, purring sound that the great cats  themselves made when contented and happy.  It was the nearest approach  to a friendly advance that Tarzan could make in the language of Sheeta.    The panther ceased his snarling and eyed the ape-man closely.   To lift  the tree's great weight from the animal it was necessary to come within  reach of those long, strong talons, and when the tree had been removed  the man would be totally at the mercy of the savage beast; but to  Tarzan of the Apes fear was a thing unknown.    Having decided, he acted promptly.    Unhesitatingly, he stepped into the tangle of branches close to the  panther's side, still voicing his friendly and conciliatory purr.  The  cat turned his head toward the man, eyeing him steadily--questioningly.  The long fangs were bared, but more in preparedness than threat.    Tarzan put a broad shoulder beneath the bole of the tree, and as he did  so his bare leg pressed against the cat's silken side, so close was the  man to the great beast.    Slowly Tarzan extended his giant thews.    The great tree with its entangling branches rose gradually from the  panther, who, feeling the encumbering weight diminish, quickly crawled  from beneath.  Tarzan let the tree fall back to earth, and the two  beasts turned to look upon one another.    A grim smile lay upon the ape-man's lips, for he knew that he had taken  his life in his hands to free this savage jungle fellow; nor would it  have surprised him had the cat sprung upon him the instant that it had  been released.    But it did not do so.  Instead, it stood a few paces from the tree  watching the ape-man clamber out of the maze of fallen branches.    Once outside, Tarzan was not three paces from the panther.   He might  have taken to the higher branches of the trees upon the opposite side,  for Sheeta cannot climb to the heights to which the ape-man can go; but  something, a spirit of bravado perhaps, prompted him to approach the  panther as though to discover if any feeling of gratitude would prompt  the beast to friendliness.    As he approached the mighty cat the creature stepped warily to one  side, and the ape-man brushed past him within a foot of the dripping  jaws, and as he continued on through the forest the panther followed on  behind him, as a hound follows at heel.    For a long time Tarzan could not tell whether the beast was following  out of friendly feelings or merely stalking him against the time he  should be hungry; but finally he was forced to believe that the former  incentive it was that prompted the animal's action.    Later in the day the scent of a deer sent Tarzan into the trees, and  when he had dropped his noose about the animal's neck he called to  Sheeta, using a purr similar to that which he had utilized to pacify  the brute's suspicions earlier in the day, but a trifle louder and more  shrill.    It was similar to that which he had heard panthers use after a kill  when they had been hunting in pairs.    Almost immediately there was a crashing of the underbrush close at  hand, and the long, lithe body of his strange companion broke into view.    At sight of the body of Bara and the smell of blood the panther gave  forth a shrill scream, and a moment later two beasts were feeding side  by side upon the tender meat of the deer.    For several days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle  together.    When one made a kill he called the other, and thus they fed well and  often.    On one occasion as they were dining upon the carcass of a boar that  Sheeta had dispatched, Numa, the lion, grim and terrible, broke through  the tangled grasses close beside them.    With an angry, warning roar he sprang forward to chase them from their  kill.  Sheeta bounded into a near-by thicket, while Tarzan took to the  low branches of an overhanging tree.    Here the ape-man unloosed his grass rope from about his neck, and as  Numa stood above the body of the boar, challenging head erect, he  dropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck, drawing the stout  strands taut with a sudden jerk.   At the same time he called shrilly  to Sheeta, as he drew the struggling lion upward until only his hind  feet touched the ground.    Quickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch, and as the panther, in  answer to his summons,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#7)"],[1," the abdomen and  rumen, and removing a part of the contents of the rumen. This is not a  dangerous operation when properly performed, and should not be postponed  until the animal is too weak to make a recovery.    IMPACTION OF THE OMASUM.--This disease may occur as a complication of other  forms of acute indigestion and diseases accompanied by an abnormal body  temperature. Feeds that are dry and innutritions commonly cause it. Other  causes are an excessive quantity of feed, sudden changes in the diet and  drinking an insufficient quantity of water.    As in other diseases of the stomach, the appetite is diminished, rumination  ceases or occurs at irregular intervals, and the animal is more or less  feverish. Bloating and constipation may occur. The animal may lose flesh,  is weak, walks stiffly and grunts as though in pain when it moves about in  the stall and at each respiration. In the acute form, marked symptoms are  sometimes manifested. At first the animal acts drowsy; later violent  nervous symptoms may develop.    _The course_ of this disease varies from a few days to several weeks. Death  frequently occurs. Frequently a diarrhoea accompanies recovery, a portion  of the faeces appearing black with polished surfaces, as though they had  been baked.    _The preventive treatment_ consists in practising the necessary precautions  against the development of this disease by avoiding sudden changes in the  feed, the feeding of dry, innutritions feeds in too large amounts, allowing  animals plenty of water and providing them with salt. The best purgative to  give is Glauber's or Epsom salts in from one- to two-pound doses, dissolved  in at least one gallon of water. This physic may be repeated in from twelve  to eighteen hours if necessary. Two drachms of tincture of nux vomica and  one ounce of alcohol may be given in a drench three times daily. Hypodermic  injections of strychnine, eserine, or pilocarpine are useful in the  treatment of this disease. When recovery begins, the animal should be  allowed moderate exercise and be fed food of a laxative nature.    FOREIGN BODIES IN THE STOMACH OF RUMINANTS.--Foreign bodies such as hair  balls and wire are very commonly found in the reticulum. This is because of  the habits of this class of animals. Cattle eat their feed hastily and do  not pick it over as carefully as does the horse.    Smooth, round objects do no appreciable harm unless they block the opening  into the third compartment of the stomach. This frequently occurs in  wool-eating lambs. Sharp-pointed objects may penetrate the surrounding  tissues or such organs as the spleen, diaphragm, and pericardial sack. If  these organs are injured by the foreign body serious symptoms develop. The  _general symptoms_ are pain, fever, weakness and marked emaciation. It is  very difficult to form a correct diagnosis, as the disease comes on without  any apparent cause. Sometimes a swelling is noticed in the right and  inferior abdominal region. If the heart becomes injured, symptoms of  pericarditis are manifested.    _The treatment_ is largely preventive. Special care should be used to avoid  getting foreign substances into the feed given to cattle. The feed troughs  should be kept clean; we should avoid dropping nails and staples into the  feed when repairing the silo or grain bin; and pieces of baling wire should  be removed from straw or hay. Feeds known to be dirty should be run through  a fanning mill before feeding.    INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH OF SWINE.--Overloading and feeding spoiled feed  are _common causes_ of inflammation of the stomach. Swill-fed hogs are most  commonly affected with this disorder. Overloading more often results in an  inflammation of the stomach if the overloading follows the feeding of a  light ration, and the weather is extremely warm. Hogs that are accustomed  to eating salt may eat too much of it when fed to them after it is withheld  for a week or longer, and a large quantity of water is taken soon  afterwards. Slop containing alkaline washing powders and soaps irritate the  stomach and intestines and cause a serious inflammation.    _The symptoms_ are loss of appetite, restlessness and sometimes colicky  pains. The hog usually wanders off by itself, acts dull, grunts, lies down  in a quiet place or stands with the back arched and the abdomen held tense.  Vomiting commonly occurs. Sometimes the animal has a diarrhoea. The body  temperature may be above normal.    _The treatment_ consists in avoiding irritating feeds and sudden changes in  the kind or quantity of feed fed. Drenching with hot water, or with about  one ounce of ipecacuan may be practised. From one to three ounces of castor  oil, depending on the size of the hog, may be given. After recovery the  hogs should be confined in a comfortable pen and fed an easily digested  ration.    DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES    GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The intestinal tract of solipeds is the best developed  of any of the domestic animals (Fig. 14). It is divided into two portions,  _small_ and _large_. The _small intestine_ is a little over seventy feet in  length and about one and one-half inches in diameter. The mucous membrane  lining presents a large absorbing surface and is well supplied with  absorbing vessels that take up the sugars, proteids and fats, which are  finally distributed to the body cells by the blood capillaries. In addition  to these absorbing vessels the mucous membrane contains intestinal glands  that secrete the intestinal juice. Other digestive secretions from the  pancreatic gland and the liver are poured into the small intestine near its  origin. These digestive juices act on the proteids, sugars, starches and  fats, changing them into substances that are capable of being absorbed.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of horse:  oesophagus; stomach; liver; small intestine; large intestine; spleen.]    After disengaging itself from the mass of loops lodged in the region of the  left flank, the small intestine crosses to the region of the right flank,  where it terminates in the first division of the large intestine.    _The large intestine_ is formed by the following divisions: caecum, double  colon, floating colon and rectum. The caecum is a large blind pouch that  has a capacity of about seven gallons. The double colon is the largest  division of the intestines. It is about twelve feet in length and has a  capacity of about eighteen gallons. This portion of the intestine  terminates in the region of the left flank in the floating colon. The  latter is about ten feet in length and about twice the diameter of the  small intestine, from which it can readily be distinguished by its  sacculated walls. The rectum is the terminal portion of the intestinal  tract. It is about one and one-half feet in length and possesses heavy,  elastic walls.    Fermentation and cellulose digestion occur in the caecum and double colon.  It is in the floating colon that the faeces are moulded into balls. The  faeces are retained in the rectum until defecation takes place.    The _intestinal tract of cattle_ is longer than that of solipeds and the  different divisions are not as well defined as in the horse's intestine and  about one-half its diameter. The large intestine is about thirty-five feet  in length and its capacity six or seven gallons (Fig. 15).    ACUTE INTESTINAL INDIGESTION OF SOLIPEDS.--Acute indigestion is more common  in horses and mules than it is in any of the other domestic animals.  Because of the difference in the causes and symptoms manifested, we may  divide it into the following forms: spasmodic, flatulent and obstruction  colic.    _The predisposing causes_ are general and digestive debility resulting from  the feeding of an insufficient or unsuitable ration, and general and  parasitic diseases of the intestine. Nervous, well-bred horses are most  susceptible to nervous or spasmodic colic.    _The direct causes_ are improper methods of feeding and watering; giving  the animal severe or unusual exercise immediately before or after feeding;  the feeding of spoiled or green feeds and new grains; chilling of the body;  imperfect mastication of feed because of defective teeth; obstruction of  the intestine by worms.    The feeding of grain at a time when the animal is not in fit condition to  digest it results in imperfect digestion in both the stomach and intestine.  This leads to irritation of the intestine and abnormal fermentation of its  contents. The drinking of a large quantity of water immediately after  feeding grain flushes at least a part of the undigested grain from the  stomach through the small intestine and into the caecum. New grains, such  as new oats, are hurried along the small intestine and reach the large  intestine practically undigested. The two latter conditions are common  causes of _flatulent_ or _wind colic_. Sudden change in the ration,  especially to a green feed, may result in intestinal irritation and  flatulence.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of  ruminant: oesophagus; rumen; reticulum; omasum; abomasum; small intestine;  and large intestine.]    Horses that are greedy feeders and have sharp, uneven, smooth or diseased  teeth are unable to masticate the feed properly. This results in  unthriftiness caused by imperfect digestion and assimilation of the feed.  Such animals usually suffer from a catarrhal or chronic inflammation of the  intestine, and may have periodic attacks of acute indigestion or colic.    _Obstruction colic_ is very often caused by the feeding of too much  roughage in the form of straw, shredded fodder, or hay. Debility often  contributes to this form of indigestion, and the double colon may become  badly impacted with alimentary matter.    Worms may irritate the intestinal mucous membrane and interfere with  digestion, obstruct the intestine and cause debility and circulatory  disturbances. The "]]]
