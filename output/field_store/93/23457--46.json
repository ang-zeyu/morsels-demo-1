Henry  Lawson was one of those whom time had lowered in fortune. His business  speculations had, for a lengthened period, been rather unsuccessful,  while Mrs. Lawson's expensive habits increased every day. At length  affairs came to such a crisis, that retrenchment or failure was  inevitable. Henry had enough of wisdom and spirit to insist on the  first alternative, and Mrs. Lawson was compelled by the pressure  of circumstances to yield in a certain degree; the country-house,  therefore, was let, Mrs. Lawson assigning as a reason, that she had  lost all relish for the country after the death of her dear children,  both of whom had died, leaving the parents childless.    It was the morning of a close sultry day in July, and Mrs. Lawson was  seated in her drawing-room. She was dressed carefully and expensively  as of old, but she had been dunned and threatened at least  half-a-dozen times for the price of the satin dress she wore. Her  face was thin and pale, and there was a look of much care on her  countenance; her eyes were restless and sunken, and discontent  spoke in their glances as she looked on the chairs, sofas, and  window-draperies, which had once been bright-colored, but were now  much faded. She had just come to the resolution of having new covers  and hangings, though their mercer's and upholsterer's bills were  long unsettled, when a visitor was shown into the room. It was Mrs.  Thompson, the wife of a very prosperous and wealthy shopkeeper.    Mrs. Lawson's thin lips wreathed themselves into bright smiles of  welcome, whilst the foul demon took possession of her soul. Mrs.  Thompson's dress was of the most costly French satin, whilst hers was  merely British manufacture. They had been old school companions and  rivals in their girlish days. During the first years of the married  life of each, Mrs. Lawson had outshone Mrs. Thompson in every respect;  but now the eclipsed star beamed brightly and scornfully beside the  clouds which had rolled over her rival. Mrs. Thompson was, in face  and figure, in dress and speech, the very impersonation of vulgar and  ostentatious wealth.    \"My goodness, it's so hot!\" she said, loosening the fastening of  her bonnet, the delicate French blond and white satin and plume,  of which that fabric was composed, contrasting rather painfully at  the same time with her flushed mahogany-colored complexion, and  ungracefully-formed features. \"Bless me, I'm so glad we'll get off to  our country-house to-morrow. It's so very delightful, Mrs. Lawson, to  have a country residence to go to. Goodness me, what a close room,  and such a hot, dusty street. It does just look so queer to me after  Fitzherbert-square.\"    To this Mrs. Lawson made a response as composed as she could; she  would have retorted bitterly and violently, but her husband had a  connection with the Thompson establishment, and for strong reasons she  considered it prudent to refrain from quarreling with Mrs. Thompson.  She therefore spoke but very little, and Mrs. Thompson was left at  full liberty to give a lengthened detail of Mr. Thompson's great  wealth and her own great profusion. She began first with herself, and  furnished an exact detail of all the fine things she had purchased  in the last month, down to the latest box of pins. Next, her babies  occupied her for half an hour--the quantity of chicken they  consumed, and the number of frocks they soiled per diem were minutely  chronicled. Then her house came under consideration: she depicted  the bright glory of the new _ponceau_ furniture, as contrasted with  shocking old faded things--and she glanced significantly toward Mrs.  Lawson's sofas and chairs. Next she made a discursive detour to the  culinary department, and gave a statement of the number of stones of  lump sugar she was getting boiled in preserves, and of the days of the  week in which they had puddings, and the days they had pies at dinner.    \"But, Mrs. Lawson dear, have you seen old Mr. Lawson since he came  home?\" she said, when she was rising to depart: \"but I suppose you  haven't, for they say he won't have anything to do with his relations  now--he won't come near you I have heard. They say he has brought such  a lot of money with him from South America.\"    At this intelligence every feature of Mrs. Lawson's face brightened  with powerful interest. She inquired where Mr. Lawson stopped, and  was informed that he had arrived at the best hotel in town about three  days previously, and that every one talked of the large fortune he had  made abroad, as he seemed to make no secret of the fact.    A burning eagerness to obtain possession of that money entered Mrs.  Lawson's soul, and she thought every second of time drawn out to the  painful duration of a long hour, while Mrs. Thompson slowly moved her  ample skirts of satin across the drawing-room, and took her departure.  Mrs. Lawson dispatched a messenger immediately for her husband.    Henry Lawson came in, and listened with surprise to the intelligence  of his father's return. He was taking up his hat to proceed to  the hotel in quest of him, when a carriage drove to the door.  Mrs. Lawson's heart palpitated with eagerness--if it should be her  husband's father in his own carriage--how delightful!--that horrible  Mrs. Thompson had not a carriage of her own yet, though she was always  talking of it. They, Mrs. Lawson and her husband, had just been about  setting up a carriage when business failed with them. She ran  briskly down the stairs--for long years she had not flown with such  alertness--rapid visions of gold, of splendor, and triumph seemed to  bear her along, as if she had not been a being of earth.    She was not disappointed, for there, at the open door, stood John  Lawson. He was enveloped in a cloak of fur, the costliness of which  told Mrs. Lawson that it was the purchase of wealth; a servant in  plain livery supported him, for he seemed a complete invalid.    Mrs. Lawson threw her arms around his neck, and embraced him with a  warmth and eagerness which brought a cold and bitter smile over the  white, thin lips of John Lawson. He replied briefly to the welcomings  he had received. He threw aside his cloak, and exhibited the figure  of an exceedingly emaciated and feeble old man, who had all the  appearance of ninety years, though he was little more than sixty; his  face was worn and fleshless to a painful degree; his hair was of the  whitest shade of great age, but his eyes had grown much more serene in  their expression than in his earlier days, notwithstanding a cast of  suffering which his whole countenance exhibited. He was plainly, but  most carefully and respectably dressed; a diamond ring of great value  was on one of his fingers; the luster of the diamonds caught Mrs.  Lawson's glance on her first inspection of his person, and her heart  danced with rapture--Mrs. Thompson had no such ring, with all her  boasting of all her finery.    \"I have come to see my child before I die,\" said the old man, gazing  on his son with earnest eyes; \"you broke the ties of nature between  us on your part, when, ten years ago, you refused your father a few  shillings from your abundance, but--\"    He was interrupted by Mrs. Lawson, who uttered many voluble  protestations of her deep grief at her having, even though for the  sake of economy, refused the money her dear father had solicited  before he left them. She vowed that she had neither ate, nor slept,  nor even dressed herself for weeks after his departure; and that,  sleeping or waking, she was perpetually wishing she had given him the  money, even though she had known that he was going to throw it into  the fire, or lose it in any way. Her poor, dear father--oh, she wept  so after she heard that he had left the country. To be sure, Henry  could tell how, for two or three nights, her pillow was soaked with  tears.    A cold, bitter smile again flitted across the old man's lips; he made  no response to her words, but in the one look which his hollow eyes  cast on her, he seemed to read the falsehood of her assertions.    \"I was going to add,\" he said, \"that though you forgot you were my  son, and refused to act as my son, when you withheld the paltry sum  for which I begged, yet I could not refrain from coming once more to  look on my child's face--to look on the face of my departed wife in  yours--for I know that a very brief period must finish my life now.  I should not have come here, I feel--I know it is the weakness of my  nature--I should have died amongst strangers, for the strangers  of other countries, the people of a different hue and a different  language, I have found kind and pitiful, compared with those of my  own house.\"    \"Oh, don't say so--don't say so--you are our own beloved father; ah,  my heart clings to every feature of your poor, dear old face: there  are the eyes and all that I used to talk to Henry so much about. Don't  talk of strangers--I shall nurse you and attend to you night and day.\"    She made a movement, as if she would throw her arms around his neck  again, but the old man drew back.    \"Woman! your hypocritical words show me that your pitiless heart is  still unchanged--that it has grown even worse. You forced me out to  the world in my old age, when I should have had no thoughts except  of God and the world to come; you forced me to think of money-making,  when my hair was gray and my blood cold with years. Yes, I had to  draw my thoughts from the future existence, and to waste them on the  miserable toils of traffic, in order to make money: for it was better  to do this than to drag out my life a pensioner on your bounty,  receiving shillings and pence, which you gave me as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#8)"],[1," or  perhaps 18th? It is true that _fiance_ and dike-captain are almost  incompatible; but were I not the latter, I have not the slightest idea  who would be. The revenues of the office are small, and the duties  sometimes laborious; the gentlemen of the neighborhood, however, are  deeply concerned, and yet without public spirit. And even if one  should be discovered who would undertake it for the sake of the title,  which is, strange to say, much desired in these parts, yet there is no  one here (may God forgive me the offence) who would not be either  unfit for the business or faint-hearted. A fine opinion, you will  think, I have of myself, that I only am none of this; but I assert  with all of my native modesty that I have all these faults in less  degree than the others in this part of the country--which is, in fact,  not saying much.    I have not yet been able to write to Moritz, and yet I must send  something to which he can reply, inasmuch as my former letter has not  as yet brought a sign of life. Or have you crowded me out of his  heart, and do you fill it alone? The little pale-faced child is not in  danger, I hope. That is a possibility in view of which I am terrified  whenever I think of it--that as a crowning misfortune of our most  afflicted friend, this thread of connection with Marie might be  severed. But she will soon be a year and a half old, you know; she has  passed the most dangerous period for children. Will you mope and talk  of warm hands and cold love if I pay a visit to Moritz on my next  journey, instead of flying to Reinfeld without a pause as is required  of a loving youth?    That you are getting pale, my heart, distresses me. Do you feel well  otherwise, physically, and of good courage? Give me a bulletin of your  condition, your appetite, your sleep. I am surprised also that Hedwig  Dewitz has written to you--such a heterogeneous nature, that can have  so little in common with you. She was educated with my sister for  several years in Kniephof, although she was four or five years the  elder of the two. Either she loves you--which I should find quite easy  to explain--or has other prosaic intentions. I fancy that she, as is  quite natural, does not feel at home in her father's house; she has,  therefore, always made her home with others for long periods and with  satisfaction.    In your letter which lies before me I come upon \"self-control\" again.  That is a fine acquisition for one who may profit by it, but surely to  be distinguished from compulsion. It is praiseworthy and amiable to  wean one's self from tasteless or provoking outbursts of feeling, or  to give to them a more ingratiating form; but I call it  self-constraint--which makes one sick at heart--when one stifles his  own feelings in himself. In social intercourse one may practise it,  but not we two between ourselves. If there be tares in the field of  our heart, we will mutually exert ourselves so to dispose of them that  their seed cannot spring up; but, if it does, we will openly pull it  up, but not cover it artificially with straw and hide it--that harms  the wheat and does not injure the tares. Your thought was, I take it,  to pull them up unaided, without paining me by the sight of them; but  let us be in this also one heart and one flesh, even if your little  thistles sometimes prick my fingers. Do not turn your back on them nor  conceal them from me. You will not always take pleasure in my big  thorns, either--so big that I cannot hide them; and we must pull at  them both together, even though our hands bleed. Moreover, thorns  sometimes bear very lovely flowers, and if yours bear roses we may  perhaps let them alone sometimes. \"The best is foe to the good\"--in  general, a very true saying; so do not have too many misgivings about  all your tares, which I have not yet discovered, and leave at least a  sample of them for me. With this exhortation, so full of unction, I  will go to sleep, although it has just struck ten, for last night  there was little of it; the unaccustomed physical exercise has used me  up a bit, and tomorrow I am to be in the saddle again before daylight.  Very, very tired am I, like a child.      Schoenhausen, March 14, 1847.    _Jeanne la Mechante!_--What is the meaning of this? A whole week has  passed since I heard a syllable from you, and today I seized the  confused mass of letters with genuine impatience--seven official  communications, a bill, two invitations, one of which is for a theatre  and ball at Greifenberg, but not a trace of Zuckers (the Reinfeld  post-office) and \"Hochwohlgeboren.\" [14] I could not believe my eyes, and  had to look through the letters twice; then I set my hat quite on my  right ear and took a two hours' walk on the highway in the rain, without  a cigar, assailed by the most conflicting sentiments--\"a prey to violent  emotions,\" as we are accustomed to say in romances. I have got used to  receiving my two letters from you regularly every week, and when once we  have acquired the habit of a thing we look upon that as our well-won  right, an injury to which enrages us. If I only knew against whom I  should direct my wrath--against Boege, against the post-office, or  against you, _la chatte la plus noire_, inside and out. And why don't  you write? Are you so exhausted with the effort you made in sending two  letters at a time on Friday of last week? Ten days have gone by since  then--time enough to rest yourself. Or do you want to let me writhe,  while you feast your eyes on my anxiety, tigress! after speaking to me  in your last letters about scarlet and nervous fevers, and after I had  laid such stress on my maxim of never believing in anything bad before  it forces itself upon me as incontestable? We adhere firmly to our  maxims only so long as they are not put to the test; when that happens  we throw them away, as the peasant did his slippers, and run off on the  legs that nature gave us. If you have the disposition to try the virtue  of my maxims, then I shall never again give utterance to any of them,  lest I be caught lying; for the fact is that I do really feel somewhat  anxious. With fevers in Reddis, to let ten days pass without writing is  very horrible of you, if you are well. Or can it be that you did not  receive on Thursday, as usual, my letter that I mailed on Tuesday in  Magdeburg, and, in your indignation at this, resolved not to write to me  for another week? If _that_ is the state of affairs, I can't yet make up  my mind whether to scold or laugh at you. The worst of it now is that,  unless some lucky chance brings a letter from you directly to Stolp, I  shall not have any before Thursday, for, as I remember it, there is no  mail leaving you Saturday and Sunday, and I should have received  Friday's today. If you have not sworn off writing altogether and wish to  reply to this letter, address me at Naugard. * * *    Had another visitor, and he stayed to supper and well into the  night--my neighbor, the town-counsellor Gaertner. People think they  must call on each other Sunday evening, and can have nothing else to  do. Now that all is quiet in the night, I am really quite disturbed  about you and your silence, and my imagination, or, if not that, then  the being whom you do not like to have me name, shows me with scornful  zeal pictures of everything that _could_ happen. Johanna, if you were  to fall sick now, it would be terrible beyond description. At the  thought of it, I fully realize how deeply I love you, and how deeply  the bond that unites us has grown into me. I understand what you call  loving much. When I think of the possibility of separation--and  possible it is still--I should never have been so lonely in all my  dreary, lonely life.    What would Moritz's situation be, compared with that?--for he has a  child, a father, a sister, dear and intimate friends in the  neighborhood. I have no one within forty miles with whom I should be  tempted to talk more than that which politeness demands; only a  sister--but a happily married one with children is really one no  longer, at least for a brother who is single. For the first time I am  looking the possibility straight in the eyes that you might be taken  away from me, that I might be condemned to inhabit these empty rooms  without a prospect of your sharing them with me, with not a soul in  all the surrounding region who would not be as indifferent to me as  though I had never seen him. I should, indeed, not be so devoid to  comfort in myself as of old, but I should also have lost something  that I used not to know--a loving and beloved heart, and at the same  time be separated from all that which used to make life easy in  Pomerania through habit and friendship. A very egotistical line of  thought and way of looking at things this discloses, you will say.  Certainly, but Pain and Fear are egotists, and, in cases like that  referred to, I never think the deceased, but only the survivors, are  to be pitied. But who speaks of dying? All this because you have not  written for a week; and then I have the assurance to lecture you for  gloomy forebodings, etc.! If you had only not spoken of the deadly  fevers in your last letter. In the evening I am always excited, in the  loneliness, when I am not tired. Tomorrow, in bright daylight, in the  railway carriage, I shall perhaps grasp your possible situation with  greater confidence.    Be rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in  prayer. All the angels will guard you, my beloved heart, so that we  shall soon meet again with joy. Farewell, and salute your parents. I  wrote your father this morning. Your faithful BISMARCK.      Berlin, Friday, May 15, '47.    _Dear Heart_,--Your father gave me your letter this morning at the  session, and in consequence I hardly know what subject was discussed,  or, at least, lacked energy to form a clear, conscious conception of  it. My thoughts were in Reinfeld and my heart"]]]
