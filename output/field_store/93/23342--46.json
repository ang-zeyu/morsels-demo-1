The Grammont, 22-gun sloop, was unfortunately  in harbour at the time, and was also taken. Douglas at once pressed two  English merchant vessels into the service, and putting a petty officer in  command of one, the William, and his Master in the other, the Bonetta,  despatched them to cruise in search of Captain Graves, the reappointed  Governor of Newfoundland, who was daily expected from England. The  Bonetta soon fell in with the Antelope, Graves's ship, and she  immediately joined Douglas, and then proceeded to strengthen the Isle of  Boys as far as time would allow. Then going to Placentia, a place of as  much importance as St. John's, and more capable of defence, they set  about making preparations to beat off any attack, leaving a garrison of  99 men and as many marines as could be spared. Graves then despatched  Douglas with the remainder of the Syren's marines to take possession of  Ferryland, and sent the ship herself off with letters to Lord Colville,  but the William having missed the Antelope, made her way to Halifax with  the news of what had occurred.    RECAPTURE OF ST. JOHN'S.    Colville at once sent word to General Amherst, Commander-in-Chief in  America, asking him to forward any troops he could spare, and started,  accompanied by the Gosport, and an armed colonial vessel, the King  George, 20 guns, to cruise off the Newfoundland coast in order to prevent  the arrival of French reinforcements or supplies. He met Graves at  Placentia on 14th August, and landed all the marines he could, and then  continued his cruise. Amherst collected every available man from New  York, Halifax, and Louisberg, and putting them under the command of his  brother, Colonel William Amherst, ordered him to use every despatch and  join Lord Colville without delay. This the Colonel succeeded in doing on  12th September off Cape Spear, and the next day they landed at Torbay,  some three leagues north of St. John's. They drove in the French outposts  and took possession of a small harbour named Quidi Vidi, which had been  blocked at the entrance by the French. Clearing away the obstructions  they landed their stores and some artillery, and advancing on St. John's,  compelled its surrender on the 17th. Notwithstanding that, as Captain  Graves reported, \"the French had put St. John's in a better state of  defence than ever we had it in.\"    On the 16th a strong gale blew the English ship some distance off the  coast, and was followed by a thick fog, during which the French squadron  managed to tow out of the harbour, but were in such a hurry to get away  that they did not stop to pick up their boats and immediately made sail,  being so far out of reach in the morning, that though some of them were  seen by the British, it was not realised that they could be the French  escaping from a squadron inferior in strength. Lord Colville, writing to  the Admiralty, says:    \"At six next morning it being calm with a great swell, we saw from the  masthead, but could not bring them down no lower than halfway to topmast  shrouds, four sail bearing South-South-East, distance 7 leagues. We lost  sight about seven, though very clear, and sometime after a small breeze  springing up from the South-West quarter, I stood towards Torbay in order  to cover the shallops that might be going from thence to Kitty Vitty. In  the afternoon I received a note from Colonel Amherst, acquainting me that  the French fleet got out last night. Thus after being blocked up in St.  John's Harbour for three weeks by a squadron of equal number, but smaller  ships with fewer guns and men, M. de Ternay made his escape in the night  by a shameful flight. I beg leave to observe that not a man in the  squadron imagined the four sail, when we saw them, were the enemy; and  the pilots were of opinion that they must have had the wind much stronger  than with us to overcome the easterly swell in the harbour's mouth. I  sent the King George as far as Trepassy, to bring me intelligence if the  enemy should steer towards Placentia; and I directed Captain Douglas of  the Syren to get the transports moved from Torbay, a very unsafe road, to  the Bay of Bulls.\"    As soon as information was received in England that an expedition had  been sent from France, the Admiralty despatched a squadron under Captain  Pallisser in pursuit, and as it arrived in St. John's only four days  after M. de Ternay left, they must have been very close to a meeting.    COOK MEETS COOK.    Whilst the movements leading up to the recapture of St. John's were being  carried on, communication between Colville and Amherst was kept up by the  boats of the fleet under the charge of the third lieutenant of H.M.S.  Gosport, Mr. James Cook, formerly Master of H.M.S. Mercury, who performed  this duty to the complete satisfaction of Lord Colville as signified in  his despatches to the Admiralty. It is certain, therefore, that the two  namesakes must have come face to face here, and most probably previously  in Halifax Harbour.    Entering St. John's Harbour on 19th September, the flagship remained till  7th October, during which time Cook was very busily employed in assisting  to place the island in a better state of defence. In a despatch of Lord  Colville's, dated \"Spithead, 25th October 1762,\" he says:    \"I have mentioned in another letter, that the fortifications on the  Island of Carbonera were entirely destroyed by the enemy. Colonel Amherst  sent thither Mr. Desbarres, an engineer, who surveyed the island and drew  a plan for fortifying it with new works: when these are finished the  Enterprise's six guns will be ready to mount on them. But I believe  nothing will be undertaken this year, as the season is so far advanced,  and no kind of materials on the spot for building barracks or sheds for  covering the men, should any be sent there. Mr. Cook, Master of the  Northumberland, accompanied Mr. Desbarres. He has made a draught of  Harbour Grace and the Bay of Carbonera, both of which are in a great  measure commanded by the Island, which lies off a point of land between  them. Hitherto we have had a very imperfect knowledge of these places,  but Mr. Cook, who was particularly careful in sounding them, has  discovered that ships of any size may lie in safety both in Harbour Grace  and the Bay of Carbonera.\"    Mr. Desbarres's design for the fortification of Carbonera, drawn by John  Chamberlain, dated 7th April 1763, is to be found in the British Museum;  he was afterwards Governor of Cape Breton.    On the return of the Northumberland to Spithead, where she arrived on  24th October, her Master, James Cook, was discharged, the Muster Roll  merely noting \"superseded\" on 11th November, and the pay sheet records  the deductions from his wages as: \"Chest, 2 pounds 1 shilling 0 pence;  Hospital, 1 pound 0 shillings 6 pence. Threepence in the pound, 3 pounds  14 shillings 9 pence,\" leaving a balance due of 291 pounds 19 shillings 3  pence. He also received from Lord Colville for the Secretary to the  Admiralty the following letter which shows the estimation he was held in  by his immediate superiors, and would doubtless be of weight when the  appointment of a man to execute greater undertakings came under the  consideration of their Lordships.    London, 30th December 1762.    Sir,    Mr. Cook, late Master of the Northumberland, acquaints me that he has  laid before their Lordships all his draughts and observations relating to  the River St. Lawrence, part of the coast of Nova Scotia, and of  Newfoundland.    On this occasion I beg to inform their Lordships that from my experience  of Mr. Cook's genius and capacity, I think him well qualified for the  work he has performed and for greater undertakings of the same kind.  These draughts being made under my own eye, I can venture to say they may  be the means of directing many in the right way, but cannot mislead any.    I am, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,    Colville.    MARRIAGE.    Before the close of the year Cook took upon himself further  responsibilities as set forth in the following extract from the register  of St. Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex:    \"James Cook of ye Parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, in ye County of  Middlesex, Bachelor, and Elizabeth Batts, of ye parish of Barking in ye  County of Essex, Spinster, were married in this Church by ye Archbishop  of Canterbury's Licence, this 21st day of December, one thousand seven  hundred and sixty-two, by George Downing, Vicar of Little Wakering,  Essex.\"    Besant, who obtained his information from Mrs. Cook's second cousin, the  late Canon Bennett, who as a boy knew her well, speaks most highly of her  mental qualities and personal appearance, and says the union appears to  have been a very happy one. It covered a period of about sixteen years;  but taking into consideration the times he was away on duty, sometimes  for long periods, Cook's home life in reality only extended to a little  more than four years, and Mrs. Cook must often have been months,  sometimes years, without even hearing of the existence of her husband.  Her family were fairly well-to-do; her grandfather, Mr. Charles Smith,  was a currier in Bermondsey; her cousin, also Charles Smith, was a  clockmaker of repute in Bunhill Row. Her mother, Mary Smith, married  first John Batts of Wapping, and secondly, John Blackburn of Shadwell.  Miss Batts is described as of Barking in the Marriage Register, so may  perhaps have been living with relations there, and may have met Cook when  on a visit to her mother in Shadwell, where he was residing. The  engagement must have been very short, for from the time of his joining  the Navy in 1755 to his return from Newfoundland in 1762, his leave on  shore had been very limited, and, with the exception perhaps of a day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior
