Among one primitive people at least the      activity of the breast at impregnation seems to be clearly      recognized. The Sinangolo of British New Guinea, says Seligmann      (_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, July-December, 1902,      p. 298) believe that conception takes place in the breasts; on      this account they hold that coitus should never take place before      the child is weaned or he might imbibe semen with the milk.        It is natural to assume that this connection between the activity      of the womb and the glandular activity of the breasts is a      nervous connection, by means of the spinal cord, and such a      connection certainly exists and plays a very important part in      the stimulating action of the breasts on the sexual organs. But      that there is a more direct channel of communication even than      the nervous system is shown by the fact that the secretion of      milk will take place at parturition, even when the nervous      connection has been destroyed. Mironoff found that, when the      mammary gland is completely separated from the central nervous      system, secretion, though slightly diminished, still continued.      In two goats he cut the nerves shortly before parturition and      after birth the breasts still swelled and functioned normally      (_Archives des Sciences Biologiques_, St. Petersburg, 1895,      summarized in _L'Annee Biologique_; 1895, p. 329). Ribbert,      again, cut out the mammary gland of a young rabbit and      transplanted it into the ear; five months after the rabbit bore      young and the gland secreted milk freely. The case has been      reported of a woman whose spinal cord was destroyed by an      accident at the level of the fifth and sixth dorsal vertebrae,      yet lactation was perfectly normal (_British Medical Journal_,      August 5, 1899, p. 374). We are driven to suppose that there is      some chemical change in the blood, some internal secretion from      the uterus or the ovaries, which acts as a direct stimulant to      the breasts. (See a comprehensive discussion of the phenomena of      the connection between the breasts and sexual organs, though the      conclusions are not unassailable, by Temesvary, _Journal of      Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the British Empire_, June, 1903).      That this hypothetical secretion starts from the womb rather than      the ovaries seems to be indicated by the fact that removal of      both ovaries during pregnancy will not suffice to prevent      lactation. In favor of the ovaries, see Beatson, _Lancet_, July,      1896; in favor of the uterus, Armand Routh, \"On the Interaction      between the Ovaries and the Mammary Glands,\" _British Medical      Journal_, September 30, 1899.    While, however, the communications from the sexual organs to the breast  are of a complex and at present ill understood character, the  communication from the breasts to the sexual organs is without doubt  mainly and chiefly nervous. When the child is put to the breast after  birth the suction of the nipple causes a reflex contraction of the womb,  and it is held by many, though not all, authorities that in a woman who  does not suckle her child there is some risk that the womb will not return  to its normal involuted size. It has also been asserted that to put a  child to the breast during the early months of pregnancy causes so great a  degree of uterine contraction that abortion may result.        Freund found in Germany that stimulation of the nipples by an      electrical cupping apparatus brought about contraction of the      pregnant uterus. At an earlier period it was recommended to      irritate the nipple in order to excite the uterus to parturient      action. Simpson, while pointing out that this was scarcely      adequate to produce the effect desired, thought that placing a      child to the breast after labor had begun might increase uterine      action. (J.Y. Simpson, _Obstetric Memoirs_, vol. i, p. 836; also      Fere, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 132).        The influence of lactation over the womb in preventing the return      of menstruation during its continuance is well known. According      to Remfry's investigation of 900 cases in England, in 57 per      cent. of cases there is no menstruation during lactation. (L.      Remfry, in paper read before Obstetrical Society of London,      summarized in the _British Medical Journal_, January 11, 1896, p.      86). Bendix, in Germany, found among 140 cases that in about 40      per cent. there was no menstruation during lactation (paper read      before Duesseldorf meeting of the Society of German Naturalists      and Physicians, 1899). When the child is not suckled menstruation      tends to reappear about six months after parturition.        It is possible that the divergent opinions of authorities      concerning the necessarily favorable influence of lactation in      promoting the return of the womb to its normal size may be due to      a confusion of two distinct influences: the reflex action of the      nipple on the womb and the effects of prolonged glandular      secretion of the breasts in debilitated persons. The act of      suckling undoubtedly tends to promote uterine contraction, and in      healthy women during lactation the womb may even (according to      Vineberg) be temporarily reduced to a smaller size than before      impregnation, thus producing what is known as \"lactation      atrophy.\" In debilitated women, however, the strain of      milk-production may lead to general lack of muscular tone, and      involution of the womb thus be hindered rather than aided by      lactation.    On the objective side, then, the nipple is to be regarded as an erectile  organ, richly supplied with nerves and vessels, which, under the  stimulation of the infant's lips--or any similar compression, and even  under the influence of emotion or cold,--becomes firm and projects, mainly  as a result of muscular contraction; for, unlike the penis and the  clitoris, the nipple contains no true erectile tissue and little capacity  for vascular engorgement.[19] We must then suppose that an impetus tends  to be transmitted through the spinal cord to the sexual organs, setting up  a greater or less degree of nervous and muscular excitement with uterine  contraction. These being the objective manifestations, what manifestations  are to be noted on the subjective side?    It is a remarkable proof of the general indifference with which in Europe  even the fairly constant and prominent characteristics of the psychology  of women have been treated until recent times that, so far as I am  aware,--though I have made no special research to this end,--no one before  the end of the eighteenth century had recorded the fact that the act of  suckling tends to produce in women voluptuous sexual emotions. Cabanis in  1802, in the memoir on \"Influence des Sexes\" in his _Rapports du Physique  et du Moral de l'Homme_, wrote that several suckling women had told him  that the child in sucking the breast made them experience a vivid  sensation of pleasure, shared in some degree by the sexual organs. There  can be no doubt that in healthy suckling women this phenomenon is  exceedingly common, though in the absence of any methodical and precise  investigation it cannot be affirmed that it is experienced by every woman  in some degree, and it is highly probable that this is not the case. One  lady, perfectly normal, states that she has had stronger sexual feelings  in suckling her children than she has ever experienced with her husband,  but that so far as possible she has tried to repress them, as she regards  them as brutish under these circumstances. Many other women state  generally that suckling is the most delicious physical feeling they have  ever experienced. In most cases, however, it does not appear to lead to a  desire for intercourse, and some of those who make this statement have no  desire for coitus during lactation, though they may have strong sexual  needs at other times. It is probable that this corresponds to the normal  condition, and that the voluptuous sensations aroused by suckling are  adequately gratified by the child. It may be added that there are probably  many women who could say, with a lady quoted by Fere,[20] that the only  real pleasures of sex they have ever known are those derived from their  suckling infants.    It is not difficult to see why this normal association of sexual emotion  with suckling should have come about. It is essential for the preservation  of the lives of young mammals that the mothers should have an adequate  motive in pleasurable sensation for enduring the trouble of suckling. The  most obvious method for obtaining the necessary degree of pleasurable  sensation lay in utilizing the reservoir of sexual emotion, with which  channels of communication might already be said to be open through the  action of the sexual organs on the breasts during pregnancy. The  voluptuous element in suckling may thus be called a merciful provision of  Nature for securing the maintenance of the child.        Cabanis seems to have realized the significance of this      connection as the basis of the sympathy between mother and child,      and more recently Lombroso and Ferrero have remarked (_La Donna      Delinquente_, p. 438) on the fact that maternal love has a sexual      basis in the element of venereal pleasure, though usually      inconsiderable, experienced during suckling. Houzeau has referred      to the fact that in the majority of animals the relation between      mother and offspring is only close during the period of      lactation, and this is certainly connected with the fact that it      is only during lactation that the female animal can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#8)"],[1," with raised robes, revealing her  feet.[17] So grave a historian as Strabo, as well as AElian, refers to the  story of the courtesan Rhodope whose sandal was carried off by an eagle  and dropped in the King of Egypt's lap as he was administering justice, so  that he could not rest until he had discovered to whom this delicately  small sandal belonged, and finally made her his queen. Kleinpaul, who  repeats this story, has collected many European sayings and customs  (including Turkish), indicating that the slipper is a very ancient symbol  of a woman's sexual parts.[18]        In Rome, Dufour remarks, \"Matrons having appropriated the use of      the shoe (_soccus_) prostitutes were not allowed to use it, and      were obliged to have their feet always naked in sandals or      slippers (_crepida_ and _solea_), which they fastened over the      instep with gilt bands. Tibullus delights to describe his      mistress's little foot, compressed by the band that imprisoned      it: _Ansaque compressos colligat arcta pedes_. Nudity of the foot      in woman was a sign of prostitution, and their brilliant      whiteness acted afar as a pimp to attract looks and desires.\"      (Dufour, _Histoire de la Prostitution_, vol. II., ch. xviii.)        This feeling seems to have survived in a more or less vague and      unconscious form in mediaeval Europe. \"In the tenth century,\"      according to Dufour (_Histoire de la Prostitution_, vol. VI., p.      11), \"shoes _a la poulaine_, with a claw or beak, pursued for      more than four centuries by the anathemas of popes and the      invectives of preachers, were always regarded by mediaeval      casuists as the most abominable emblems of immodesty. At a first      glance it is not easy to see why these shoes--terminating in a      lion's claw, an eagle's beak, the prow of a ship, or other metal      appendage--should be so scandalous. The excommunication inflicted      on this kind of foot-gear preceded the impudent invention of some      libertine, who wore _poulaines_ in the shape of the phallus, a      custom adopted also by women. This kind of _poulaine_ was      denounced as _mandite de Dicu_ (Ducange's Glossary, at the word      Poulainia) and prohibited by royal ordinances (see letter of      Charles V., 17 October, 1367, regarding the garments of the women      of Montpellier). Great lords and ladies continued, however, to      wear _poulaines_.\" In Louis XL's court they were still worn of a      quarter of an ell in length.        Spain, ever tenacious of ancient ideas, appears to have preserved      longer than other countries the ancient classic traditions in      regard to the foot as a focus of modesty and an object of sexual      attraction. In Spanish religious pictures it was always necessary      that the Virgin's feet should be concealed, the clergy ordaining      that her robe should be long and flowing, so that the feet might      be covered with decent folds. Pacheco, the master and      father-in-law of Velasquez, writes in 1649 in his _Arte de la      Pintura_: \"What can be more foreign from the respect which we owe      to the purity of Our Lady the Virgin than to paint her sitting      down with one of her knees placed over the other, and often with      her sacred feet uncovered and naked. Let thanks be given to the      Holy Inquisition which commands that this liberty should be      corrected!\" It was Pacheco's duty in Seville to see that these      commands were obeyed. At the court of Philip IV. at this time the      princesses never showed their feet, as we may see in the pictures      of Velasquez. When a local manufacturer desired to present that      monarch's second bride, Mariana of Austria, with some silk      stockings the offer was indignantly rejected by the Court      Chamberlain: \"The Queen of Spain has no legs!\" Philip V.'s, queen      was thrown from her horse and dragged by the feet; no one      ventured to interfere until two gentlemen bravely rescued her and      then fled, dreading punishment by the king: they were, however,      graciously pardoned. Reinach (\"Pieds Pudiques,\" _Cultes, Mythes      et Religions_, pp. 105-110) brings together several passages from      the Countess D'Aulnoy's account of the Madrid Court in the      seventeenth century and from other sources, showing how careful      Spanish ladies were as regards their feet, and how jealous      Spanish husbands were in this matter. At this time, when Spanish      influence was considerable, the fashion of Spain seems to have      spread to other countries. One may note that in Vandyck's      pictures of English beauties the feet are not visible, though in      the more characteristically English painters of a somewhat later      age it became usual to display them conspicuously, while the      French custom in this matter is the farthest removed from the      Spanish. At the present day a well-bred Spanish woman shows as      little as possible of her feet in walking, and even in some of      the most characteristic Spanish dances there is little or no      kicking, and the feet may even be invisible throughout. It is      noteworthy that in numerous figures of Spanish women (probably      artists' models) reproduced in Ploss's _Das Weib_ the stockings      are worn, although the women are otherwise, in most cases, quite      naked. Max Dessoir mentions (\"Psychologie der Vita Sexualis,\"      _Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie_, 1894, p. 954) that in Spanish      pornographic photographs women always have their shoes on, and he      considers this an indication of perversity. I have seen the      statement (attributed to Gautier's _Voyage en Espagne_, where,      however, it does not occur) that Spanish prostitutes uncover      their feet in sign of assent, and Madame d'Aulnoy stated that in      her time to show her lover her feet was a Spanish woman's final      favor.    The tendency, which we thus find to be normal at some earlier periods of  civilization, to insist on the sexual symbolism of the feminine foot or  its coverings, and to regard them as a special sexual fascination, is not  without significance for the interpretation of the sporadic manifestations  of foot-fetichism among ourselves. Eccentric as foot-fetichism may appear  to us, it is simply the re-emergence, by a pseudo-atavism or arrest of  development, of a mental or emotional impulse which was probably  experienced by our forefathers, and is often traceable among young  children to-day.[19] The occasional reappearance of this bygone impulse  and the stability which it may acquire are thus conditioned by the  sensitive reaction of an abnormally nervous and usually precocious  organism to influences which, among the average and ordinary population of  Europe to-day, are either never felt, or quickly outgrown, or very  strictly subordinated in the highly complex crystallizations which the  course of love and the process of tumescence create within us.        It may be added that this is by no means true of foot-fetichism      only. In some other fetichisms a seemingly congenital      predisposition is even more marked. This is not only the case as      regards hair-fetichism and fur-fetichism (see, e.g.,      Krafft-Ebing, _Psychopathia Sexualis_, English translation of      tenth edition, pp. 233, 255, 262). In many cases of fetichisms of      all kinds not only is there no record of any commencement in a      definite episode (an absence which may be accounted for by the      supposition that the original incident has been forgotten), but      it would seem in some cases that the fetichism developed very      slowly.    In this sense, it will be seen, although it is hazardous to speak of  foot-fetichism as strictly an atavism, it may certainly be said to arise  on a congenital basis. It represents the rare development of an inborn  germ, usually latent among ourselves, which in earlier stages of  civilization frequently reached a normal and general fruition.    It is of interest to emphasize this congenital element of foot symbolism,  because more than any other forms of sexual perversion the fetichisms are  those which are most vaguely conditioned by inborn states of the organism  and most definitely aroused by seemingly accidental associations or shocks  in early life. Inversion is sometimes so fundamentally ingrained in the  individual's constitution that it arises and develops in spite of the very  strongest influence in a contrary direction. But a fetichism, while it  tends to occur in sensitive, nervous, timid, precocious individuals--that  is to say, individuals of more or less neuropathic heredity--can usually,  though not always, be traced to a definite starting point in the shock of  some sexually emotional episode in early life.        A few examples of the influences of such association may here be      given, referring miscellaneously to various forms of erotic      symbolism. Magnan has recorded the case of a hair-fetichist,      living in a district where the women wore their hair done up, who      at the age of 15 experienced pleasurable feelings with erection      at the sight of a village beauty combing her hair; from that time      flowing hair became his fetich, and he could not resist the      temptation to touch it and if possible sever it, thus becoming a      hair-despoiler, for which he was arrested but not sentenced.      (_Archives de l'Anthropologie Criminelle_, vol. v, No. 28.)        I have elsewhere recorded the history of a boy of 14, having      already had imperfect connection with a grown-up woman, who      associated much with a young married lady; he had no sexual      relations with her, but one day she urinated in his presence, and      he saw that her mons veneris was covered by very thick hair; from      that time he worshiped this woman in secret and acquired a      life-long fetichistic attraction to women whose pubic hair was      similarly abundant (_Stu"]]]
