He was the wildest and most  untamable of all the Zanes. Most of the time he spent in the woods,  not so much to fight Indians, as Wetzel did, but for pure love of  outdoor life. At home he was thoughtful and silent.    \"Yes, I have seen him,\" answered Isaac. \"He is a Shawnee chief and  one of the fiercest warriors in that tribe of fighters. He was at  Indian-head, which is the name of one of the Wyandot villages, when  I visited there last, and he had two hundred of his best braves with  him.\"    \"He is a bad Indian. Wetzel and I know him. He swore he would hang  our scalps up in his wigwam,\" said Jonathan.    \"What has he in particular against you?\" asked Colonel Zane. \"Of  course, Wetzel is the enemy of all Indians.\"    \"Several years ago Wetzel and I were on a hunt down the river at the  place called Girty's Point, where we fell in with the tracks of five  Shawnees. I was for coming home, but Wetzel would not hear of it. We  trailed the Indians and, coming up on them after dark, we tomahawked  them. One of them got away crippled, but we could not follow him  because we discovered that they had a white girl as captive, and one  of the red devils, thinking we were a rescuing party, had tomahawked  her. She was not quite dead. We did all we could to save her life.  She died and we buried her on the spot. They were Red Fox's braves  and were on their way to his camp with the prisoner. A year or so  afterwards I learned from a friendly Indian that the Shawnee chief  had sworn to kill us. No doubt he will be a leader in the coming  attack.\"    \"We are living in the midst of terrible times,\" remarked Colonel  Zane. \"Indeed, these are the times that try men's souls, but I  firmly believe the day is not far distant when the redmen will be  driven far over the border.\"    \"Is the Indian Princess pretty?\" asked Betty of Isaac.    \"Indeed she is, Betty, almost as beautiful as you are,\" said Isaac.  \"She is tall and very fair for an Indian. But I have something to  tell about her more interesting than that. Since I have been with  the Wyandots this last time I have discovered a little of the  jealously guarded secret of Myeerah's mother. When Tarhe and his  band of Hurons lived in Canada their home was in the Muskoka Lakes  region on the Moon river. The old warriors tell wonderful stories of  the beauty of that country. Tarhe took captive some French  travellers, among them a woman named La Durante. She had a beautiful  little girl. The prisoners, except this little girl, were released.  When she grew up Tarhe married her. Myeerah is her child. Once Tarhe  took his wife to Detroit and she was seen there by an old Frenchman  who went crazy over her and said she was his child. Tarhe never went  to the white settlements again. So you see, Myeerah is from a great  French family on her mother's side, as this is old Frenchman was  probably Chevalier La Durante, and Myeerah's grandfather.\"    \"I would love to see her, and yet I hate her. What an odd name she  has,\" said Betty.    \"It is the Indian name for the white crane, a rare and beautiful  bird. I never saw one. The name has been celebrated among the Hurons  as long as any one of them can remember. The Indians call her the  White Crane, or Walk-in-the-Water, because of her love for wading in  the stream.\"    \"I think we have made Isaac talk enough for one night,\" said Colonel  Zane. \"He is tired out. Major, tell Isaac and Betty, and Mr. Clarke,  too, of your jump over the cliff.\"    \"I have heard of that leap from the Indians,\" said Isaac.    \"Major, from what hill did you jump your horse?\" asked Alfred.    \"You know the bare rocky bluff that stands out prominently on the  hill across the creek. From that spot Colonel Zane first saw the  valley, and from there I leaped my horse. I can never convince  myself that it really happened. Often I look up at that cliff in  doubt. But the Indians and Colonel Zane, Jonathan, Wetzel and others  say they actually saw the deed done, so I must accept it,\" said  Major McColloch.    \"It seems incredible!\" said Alfred. \"I cannot understand how a man  or horse could go over that precipice and live.\"    \"That is what we all say,\" responded the Colonel. \"I suppose I shall  have to tell the story. We have fighters and makers of history here,  but few talkers.\"    \"I am anxious to hear it,\" answered Clarke, \"and I am curious to see  this man Wetzel, whose fame has reached as far as my home, way down  in Virginia.\"    \"You will have your wish gratified soon, I have no doubt,\" resumed  the Colonel. \"Well, now for the story of McColloch's mad ride for  life and his wonderful leap down Wheeling hill. A year ago, when the  fort was besieged by the Indians, the Major got through the lines  and made off for Short Creek. He returned next morning with forty  mounted men. They marched boldly up to the gate, and all succeeded  in getting inside save the gallant Major, who had waited to be the  last man to go in. Finding it impossible to make the short distance  without going under the fire of the Indians, who had rushed up to  prevent the relief party from entering the fort, he wheeled his big  stallion, and, followed by the yelling band of savages, he took the  road leading around back of the fort to the top of the bluff. The  road lay along the edge of the cliff and I saw the Major turn and  wave his rifle at us, evidently with the desire of assuring us that  he was safe. Suddenly, on the very summit of the hill, he reined in  his horse as if undecided. I knew in an instant what had happened.  The Major had run right into the returning party of Indians, which  had been sent out to intercept our reinforcements. In a moment more  we heard the exultant yells of the savages, and saw them gliding  from tree to tree, slowly lengthening out their line and surrounding  the unfortunate Major. They did not fire a shot. We in the fort were  stupefied with horror, and stood helplessly with our useless guns,  watching and waiting for the seemingly inevitable doom of our  comrade. Not so with the Major! Knowing that he was a marked man by  the Indians and feeling that any death was preferable to the  gauntlet, the knife, the stake and torch of the merciless savage, he  had grasped at a desperate chance. He saw his enemies stealthily  darting from rock to tree, and tree to bush, creeping through the  brush, and slipping closer and closer every moment. On three sides  were his hated foes and on the remaining side--the abyss. Without a  moment's hesitation the intrepid Major spurred his horse at the  precipice. Never shall I forget that thrilling moment. The three  hundred savages were silent as they realized the Major's intention.  Those in the fort watched with staring eyes. A few bounds and the  noble steed reared high on his hind legs. Outlined by the clear blue  sky the magnificent animal stood for one brief instant, his black  mane flying in the wind, his head thrown up and his front hoofs  pawing the air like Marcus Curtius' mailed steed of old, and then  down with a crash, a cloud of dust, and the crackling of pine limbs.  A long yell went up from the Indians below, while those above ran to  the edge of the cliff. With cries of wonder and baffled vengeance  they gesticulated toward the dark ravine into which horse and rider  had plunged rather than wait to meet a more cruel death. The  precipice at this point is over three hundred feet in height, and in  places is almost perpendicular. We believed the Major to be lying  crushed and mangled on the rocks. Imagine our frenzy of joy when we  saw the daring soldier and his horse dash out of the bushes that  skirt the base of the cliff, cross the creek, and come galloping to  the fort in safety.\"    \"It was wonderful! Wonderful!\" exclaimed Isaac, his eyes glistening.  \"No wonder the Indians call you the 'Flying Chief.'\"    \"Had the Major not jumped into the clump of pine trees which grow  thickly some thirty feet below the summit he would not now be  alive,\" said Colonel Zane. \"I am certain of that. Nevertheless that  does not detract from the courage of his deed. He had no time to  pick out the best place to jump. He simply took his one chance, and  came out all right. That leap will live in the minds of men as long  as yonder bluff stands a monument to McColloch's ride for life.\"    Alfred had listened with intense interest to the Colonel's recital.  When it ended, although his pulses quickened and his soul expanded  with awe and reverence for the hero of that ride, he sat silent.  Alfred honored courage in a man more than any other quality. He  marvelled at the simplicity of these bordermen who, he thought, took  the most wonderful adventures and daring escapes as a matter of  course, a compulsory part of their daily lives. He had already, in  one day, had more excitement than had ever befallen him, and was  beginning to believe his thirst for a free life of stirring action  would be quenched long before he had learned to become useful in his  new sphere. During the remaining half hour of his call on his lately  acquired friends, he took little part in the conversation, but sat  quietly watching the changeful expressions on Betty's face, and  listening to Colonel Zane's jokes. When he rose to go he bade his  host good-night, and expressed a wish that Isaac, who had fallen  asleep, might have a speedy recovery. He turned toward the door to  find that Betty had intercepted him.    \"Mr. Clarke,\" she said, extending a little hand that trembled  slightly. \"I wish to say--that--I want to say that my feelings have  changed. I am sorry for what I said over at Lydia's. I spoke hastily  and rudely. You have saved my brother's life. I will be forever  grateful to you. It is useless to try to thank you. I--I hope we may  be friends.\"    Alfred found it desperately hard to resist that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#8)"],[1,"for possession of the instrument. Then Snap, becoming solicitous  for its welfare, jumped into the fray. They tussled for it amid the  clamor of a delighted circle. Snap, passing from jest to earnest, grew  so strenuous in his efforts to regain the harp that he tossed the  Navajos about like shuttle-cocks. He got the harp and, concealing it,  sought to break away. But the braves laid hold upon him, threw him to  the ground, and calmly sat astride him while they went through his  pockets. August Naab roared his merriment and Hare laughed till he  cried. The incident was as surprising to him as it was amusing. These  serious Mormons and silent Navajos were capable of mirth.    Hare would have stayed up as late as any of them, but August's saying to  him, \"Get to bed: to-morrow will be bad!\" sent him off to his blankets,  where he was soon fast asleep. Morning found him well, hungry, eager to  know what the day would bring.    \"Wait,\" said August, soberly.    They rode out of the gray pocket in the ridge and began to climb. Hare  had not noticed the rise till they were started, and then, as the horses  climbed steadily he grew impatient at the monotonous ascent. There was  nothing to see; frequently it seemed that they were soon to reach the  summit, but still it rose above them. Hare went back to his comfortable  place on the sacks.    \"Now, Jack,\" said August.    Hare gasped. He saw a red world. His eyes seemed bathed in blood. Red  scaly ground, bare of vegetation, sloped down, down, far down to a vast  irregular rent in the earth, which zigzagged through the plain beneath.  To the right it bent its crooked way under the brow of a black-timbered  plateau; to the left it straightened its angles to find a V-shaped vent  in the wall, now uplifted to a mountain range. Beyond this earth-riven  line lay something vast and illimitable, a far-reaching vision of white  wastes, of purple plains, of low mesas lost in distance. It was the  shimmering dust-veiled desert.    \"Here we come to the real thing,\" explained Naab. \"This is Windy Slope;  that black line is the Grand Canyon of Arizona; on the other side is the  Painted Desert where the Navajos live; Coconina Mountain shows his flat  head there to the right, and the wall on our left rises to the  Vermillion Cliffs. Now, look while you can, for presently you'll not be  able to see.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Wind, sand, dust, gravel, pebbles--watch out for your eyes!\"    Naab had not ceased speaking when Hare saw that the train of Indians  trailing down the slope was enveloped in red clouds. Then the white  wagons disappeared. Soon he was struck in the back by a gust which  justified Naab's warning. It swept by; the air grew clear again; once  more he could see. But presently a puff, taking him unawares, filled his  eyes with dust difficult of removal. Whereupon he turned his back to the  wind.    The afternoon grew apace; the sun glistened on the white patches of  Coconina Mountain; it set; and the wind died.    \"Five miles of red sand,\" said Naab. \"Here's what kills the horses.  Getup.\"    There was no trail. All before was red sand, hollows, slopes, levels,  dunes, in which the horses sank above their fetlocks. The wheels  ploughed deep, and little red streams trailed down from the tires. Naab  trudged on foot with the reins in his hands. Hare essayed to walk also,  soon tired, and floundered behind till Naab ordered him to ride again.  Twilight came with the horses still toiling.    \"There! thankful I am when we get off that strip! But, Jack, that  trailless waste prevents a night raid on my home. Even the Navajos shun  it after dark. We'll be home soon. There's my sign. See? Night or day we  call it the Blue Star.\"    High in the black cliff a star-shaped, wind-worn hole let the blue sky  through.    There was cheer in Naab's \"Getup,\" now, and the horses quickened with  it. Their iron-shod hoofs struck fire from the rosy road. \"Easy, easy--  soho!\" cried Naab to his steeds. In the pitchy blackness under the  shelving cliff they picked their way cautiously, and turned a corner.  Lights twinkled in Hare's sight, a fresh breeze, coming from water,  dampened his cheek, and a hollow rumble, a long roll as of distant  thunder, filled his ears.    \"What's that?\" he asked.    \"That, my lad, is what I always love to hear. It means I'm home. It's  the roar of the Colorado as she takes her first plunge into the Canyon.\"              IV. THE OASIS    AUGUST NAAB'S oasis was an oval valley, level as a floor, green with  leaf and white with blossom, enclosed by a circle of colossal cliffs of  vivid vermilion hue. At its western curve the Colorado River split the  red walls from north to south. When the wind was west a sullen roar,  remote as of some far-off driving mill, filled the valley; when it was  east a dreamy hollow hum, a somnolent song, murmured through the  cottonwoods; when no wind stirred, silence reigned, a silence not of  serene plain or mountain fastness, but shut in, compressed, strange, and  breathless. Safe from the storms of the elements as well as of the world  was this Garden of Eschtah.    Naab had put Hare to bed on the unroofed porch of a log house, but  routed him out early, and when Hare lifted the blankets a shower of  cotton-blossoms drifted away like snow. A grove of gray-barked trees  spread green canopy overhead, and through the intricate web shone  crimson walls, soaring with resistless onsweep up and up to shut out all  but a blue lake of sky.    \"I want you to see the Navajos cross the river,\" said Naab.    Hare accompanied him out through the grove to a road that flanked the  first rise of the red wall; they followed this for half a mile, and  turning a corner came into an unobstructed view. A roar of rushing  waters had prepared Hare, but the river that he saw appalled him. It was  red and swift; it slid onward like an enormous slippery snake; its  constricted head raised a crest of leaping waves, and disappeared in a  dark chasm, whence came a bellow and boom.    \"That opening where she jumps off is the head of the Grand Canyon,\" said  Naab. \"It's five hundred feet deep there, and thirty miles below it's  five thousand. Oh, once in, she tears in a hurry! Come, we turn up the  bank here.\"    Hare could find no speech, and he felt immeasurably small. All that he  had seen in reaching this isolated spot was dwarfed in comparison. This  \"Crossing of the Fathers,\" as Naab called it, was the gateway of the  desert. This roar of turbulent waters was the sinister monotone of the  mighty desert symphony of great depths, great heights, great reaches.    On a sandy strip of bank the Navajos had halted. This was as far as they  could go, for above the wall jutted out into the river. From here the  head of the Canyon was not visible, and the roar of the rapids was  accordingly lessened in volume. But even in this smooth water the river  spoke a warning.    \"The Navajos go in here and swim their mustangs across to that sand  bar,\" explained Naab. \"The current helps when she's high, and there's a  three-foot raise on now.\"    \"I can't believe it possible. What danger they must run--those little  mustangs!\" exclaimed Hare.    \"Danger? Yes, I suppose so,\" replied Naab, as if it were a new idea. \"My  lad, the Mormons crossed here by the hundreds. Many were drowned. This  trail and crossing were unknown except to Indians before the Mormon  exodus.\"    The mustangs had to be driven into the water. Scarbreast led, and his  mustang, after many kicks and reluctant steps, went over his depth,  wetting the stalwart chief to the waist. Bare-legged Indians waded in  and urged their pack-ponies. Shouts, shrill cries, blows mingled with  snorts and splashes.    Dave and George Naab in flat boats rowed slowly on the down-stream side  of the Indians. Presently all the mustangs and ponies were in, the  procession widening out in a triangle from Scarbreast, the leader. The  pack-ponies appeared to swim better than the mounted mustangs, or else  the packs of deer-pelts made them more buoyant. When one-third way  across the head of the swimming train met the current, and the line of  progress broke. Mustang after mustang swept down with a rapidity which  showed the power of the current. Yet they swam steadily with flanks  shining, tails sometimes afloat, sometimes under, noses up, and riders  holding weapons aloft. But the pack-ponies labored when the current  struck them, and whirling about, they held back the Indians who were  leading them, and blocked those behind. The orderly procession of the  start became a broken line, and then a rout. Here and there a Navajo  slipped into the water and swam, leading his mustang; others pulled on  pack-ponies and beat their mounts; strong-swimming mustangs forged  ahead; weak ones hung back, and all obeyed the downward will of the  current.    While Hare feared for the lives of some of the Navajos, and pitied the  laden ponies, he could not but revel in the scene, in its vivid action  and varying color, in the cries and shrill whoops of the Indians, and  the snorts of the frightened mustangs, in Naab's hoarse yells to his  sons, and the ever-present menacing roar from around the bend. The  wildness of it all, the necessity of peril and calm acceptance of it,  stirred within Hare the call, the awakening, the spirit of the desert.    August Naab's stentorian voice rolled out over the river. \"Ho! Dave--the  yellow pinto--pull him loose--George, back this way--there's a pack  slipping--down now, downstream, turn that straggler in--Dave, in that  tangle--quick! There's a boy drowning--his foot's caught--he's been  kicked--Hurry! Hurry!--pull him in the boat--There's a pony under--Too  late, George, let that one go--let him go, I tell you!\"    So the crossing of the Navajos proceeded, never an instant free from  danger in that churning current. The mustangs and ponies floundered  somewhat on the sand-bar and then parted the willows and appeared"]]]
