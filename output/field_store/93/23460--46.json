Here again we may form two classes: (_a_) without the  aid of the voice, f, s (sharp), ch, guttural; (_b_) with the aid of voice,  v, z, y. The consonants s and l are formed when the passage in front is  closed by elevation of the tongue against the upper dental arch so that the  air can only escape at the sides between the molar teeth: sh is formed by  the expulsion of the current of air through two narrow slits, viz. (1)  between the front of the tongue and the hard palate, the other between the  nearly closed teeth. If a space be left between the tip of the tongue and  the upper teeth two consonant sounds can be produced, one without the aid  of the voice--th (hard) as in that; the other with the aid of voice--th  (soft) as in thunder. Ch is a guttural produced near the front of the  mouth, e.g. in Christ, or near the back as in Bach.    3. _Resonants_.--In the production of the consonant m, and sometimes n, the  nasal resonator comes into play because the soft palate is not raised at  all and the sound waves produced in the larynx find a free passage through  the nose, while the mouth portion of the resonator is completely closed by  the lips. The sounds thus produced are very telling in the singing voice.    4. _Vibratory Sounds_.--There are three situations in which the consonant r  may be formed, but in the English language it is produced by the vibration  of the tip of the tongue in the constricted portion of the cavity of the  mouth, formed by the tongue and the teeth.    The consonants have been grouped by Hermann as follows:--      |                    |Labials.|Dentals.        |Gutturals.|    |1. Explosives--     |        |                |          |    |a. Without the voice|P       |T               |K         |    |b. With the voice   |B       |D               |G         |    |2. Aspirates--      |        |                |          |    |a. Without the voice|F       |S (hard), L, Sh,|Ch        |    |                    |        |Th (hard)       |          |    |b. With the voice   |V       |Z, L, Th, Zh    |Y in yes  |    |                    |        |(soft)          |          |    |3.  Resonants       |M       |N               |N (nasal) |    |4.  Vibratory sounds|Labial R|Lingual R       |Guttural R|    H is the sound produced in the larynx by the quick rushing of the air  through the widely opened glottis.    Hermann's classification which I have given is especially valuable as  regards the speaking voice, but Aikin classifies the consonants from the  singing point of view, according to the more or less complete closure of  the resonator.      CLASSIFICATION OF CONSONANTS (AIKIN)      Jaw fully open                               H, L, K, G    \"   less  \"                                  T, D, N, R    \"   nearly closed, lips closed               P, B, M    \"   \"      \"       upper lip on lower teeth  F, V    \"   quite closed                             S, Z, J, N, Ch, Sh    Aikin, moreover, points out that the English language is so full of  closures that it is difficult to keep the resonator open, and that accounts  for one of the principal difficulties in singing it.    \"The converse of this may be said of Italian, in which most words end in  pure vowels which keep the resonator open. In fact, it is this circumstance  which has made the Italian language the basis of every point of voice  culture and the producer of so many wonderful singers.\" As an example  compare the English word 'voice,' which begins with closure and ends with  closure, and the Italian 'voce,' pronounced _voche_, with its two open  vowel sounds. The vowel sound ah on the note c is the middle tone of the  speaking register, and as we know, can be used all day long without  fatigue; therefore in training the voice the endeavour should be made to  develop the register above and below this middle tone. In speaking there is  always a tendency under emotional excitement, especially if associated with  anger, to raise the pitch of the voice, whereas the tender emotions lead  rather to a lowering of the pitch. Interrogation generally leads to a rise  of the pitch; thus, as Helmholtz pointed out, in the following sentence  there is a decided fall in the pitch--\"I have been for a walk\"; whereas in  \"Have you been for a walk?\" there is a decided rise of pitch. If you utter  the sentence \"Who are you?\" there is a very definite rise of pitch on  'are.'          PATHOLOGICAL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES PRODUCING SPEECH DEFECTS  AND WHAT THEY TEACH      As I have before remarked, children utter vowel sounds before consonants,  and I used this as an argument that phonation preceded articulation; but  there is another reason for supposing that articulate sounds are of later  development phylogenetically, as well as ontogenetically. Not only are they  more dependent for their proper production on intelligence, but in those  disorders of speech which occur as a result of degenerative processes of  the central nervous system the difficulty of articulate speech precedes  that of phonation. Take, for example, bulbar paralysis, a form of  progressive muscular atrophy, a disease due to a progressive decay and  destruction of the motor nerve cells presiding over the movements of the  tongue, lips, and larynx, hence often called glosso-labial-laryngeal palsy.  In this disease the lips, tongue, throat, and often the larynx are  paralysed on both sides. \"The symptoms are, so to speak, grouped about the  tongue as a centre, and it is in this organ that the earliest symptoms are  usually manifested.\" (Gowers). Imperfect articulation of those sounds in  which the tongue is chiefly concerned, viz. the lingual consonants l, r, n,  and t, causing indistinctness of speech, is the first symptom; the lips  then become affected and there is difficulty in the pronunciation of sounds  in which the lips are concerned, viz. u, o, p, b, and m. Eventually  articulate speech becomes impossible, and the only expression remaining to  the patient is laryngeal phonation, slightly modulated and broken into the  rhythm of formless syllables.    The laryngeal palsy _rarely_ becomes complete. The nervous structures in  the _physiological mechanism_ of speech and phonation are affected in this  disease; but there are degenerative diseases of the brain in which the  _psychical mechanism_ of speech is affected, e.g. General Paralysis of the  Insane, in which the affection of speech and hand-writing is quite  characteristic. There is at first a hesitancy which may only be perceptible  to practised ears, but in which there is no real fault of articulation once  it is started; sometimes preparatory to and during the utterance there is a  tremulous motion about the muscles of the mouth. The hesitation increases,  and instead of a steady flow of modulated, articulate sounds, speech is  broken up into a succession of irregular, jerky, syllabic fragments,  without modulation, and often accompanied by a tremulous vibration of the  voice. Syllables are unconsciously dropped out, blurred, or run into one  another, or imperfectly uttered; especially is difficulty found with  consonants, particularly explosive sounds, b, p, m; again, linguals and  dentals are difficult to utter. Similar defects occur in written as in  vocal speech; the syllables and even the letters are disjointed; there is a  fine tremor in the writing, and inco-ordination in the movements of the  pen. Silent thoughts leave out syllables and words in the framing of  sentences; consequently they are not expressed by the hand. The ideation of  a written or spoken word is based upon the association of the component  syllables, and the difficulty arises primarily from the progressive  impairment of this function of association upon which spoken and written  language so largely depends. Examination of the brain in this disease  explains the cause of the speech trouble and the progressive dementia (loss  of mind) and paralysis with which it is associated. There is a wasting of  the cerebral hemispheres, especially of the frontal lobes, a portion of the  brain which, later on, we shall see is intimately associated with the  function of articulate speech.          THE CEREBRAL MECHANISM OF SPEECH AND SONG      Neither vocalisation nor articulation are essentially human. Many of the  lower animals, e.g. parrots, possess the power of articulate speech, and  birds can be taught to pipe tunes. The essential difference between the  articulate speech of the parrot and the human being is that the parrot  merely imitates sounds, it does not employ these articulate sounds to  express judgments; likewise there are imbecile human beings who,  parrot-like, repeat phrases which are meaningless. Articulate speech, even  when employed by a primitive savage, always expresses a judgment. Even in  the simple psychic process of recalling the name aroused by the sight of a  common object in daily use, and in affixing the verbal sign to that object,  a judgment is expressed. But that judgment is based upon innumerable  experiences primarily acquired through our special senses, whereby we have  obtained a knowledge of the properties and uses of the object. This  statement implies that the whole brain is consciously and unconsciously in  action. There is, however, a concentration of psychic action in those  portions of the brain which are essential for articulate speech;  consequently the word, as it is mentally heard, mentally seen, and mentally  felt (by the movements of the jaw, tongue, lips, and soft palate), occupies  the field of clear consciousness; but the concept is also the nucleus of an  immense constellation of subconscious psychic processes with which it has  been associated by experiences in the past.
