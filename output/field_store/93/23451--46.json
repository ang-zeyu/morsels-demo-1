Looking back now it is almost impossible to realize how the issue in  this case stirred the nation to its depth. It was first argued while  the country was in the throes of the fierce Fremont-Buchanan campaign,  and it was believed that the second hearing was ordered by a  pro-slavery court after Buchanan's election, to permit more time in  which to formulate the extraordinary decision at which the majority of  the court arrived. The decision was political rather than judicial, and  challenged the attention of the people beyond any act of the Supreme  Court before or since.    The Civil War was virtually an appeal from the judgment of Chief  Justice Taney and his associates to the God of Battles.    It must not be thought that a single case, although the most celebrated  in the annals of American jurisprudence, was Roswell Field's sole claim  to the title of leader of the Missouri bar during his lifetime. The  records of the Superior Court of that state bear interesting and  convincing testimony to the exceptional brilliancy of Eugene Field's  father, while the tributes to his memory, by his brothers at the bar  and the judges before whom he appeared, prove that in all the relations  of life he fulfilled the promise of ability and genius given in his  graduation from college at an age when most boys are entering a  preparatory school.    Before dismissing Roswell Field to take up the story of his son's  career, I wish to quote a few passages from a brief memoir which is  preserved in the history of Newfane, as throwing direct hereditary  light on the peculiar character, fascinating personality, and  entertaining genius of his son.    As I may hereafter have occasion to refer to Eugene Field's political  convictions, let us begin these quotations with one as to his father's  politics:    \"In the dark days of the Rebellion, during the years 1861 and 1862,  when the friends of the Union in St. Louis and Missouri felt that they  were in imminent danger of being drawn from their homes and of having  their estates confiscated by rebels and traitors, General Lyon, General  Blair, and R.M. Field were among the calm, loyal, and patriotic men who  influenced public action and saved the city and state.\"    Those of my readers who knew the son will recognize much that  captivated them in this description of the father:    \"In his social relations he was a genial and entertaining companion,  unsurpassed in conversational powers, delighting in witty and sarcastic  observations and epigrammatic sentences. He was elegant in his manners  and bland and refined in his deportment. He was a skilful musician and  passionately fond of children, and it was his wont in early life to  gather them in groups about him and beguile them by the hour with the  music of the flute or violin. He was actually devoid of all ambition  for power and place, and uniformly declined all offers of advancement  to the highest judicial honors of the state.\"    From the lips of Samuel Knox, of the St. Louis bar, we have this  testimony as to the remarkable extent and versatility of Roswell M.  Field's talents:    \"Uniting great industry and acquirements with the most brilliant wit  and genius, well and accurately informed on all subjects, both in  science and art; endowed with a memory that retained whatever it  received, with quick and clear perceptions, the choicest, most  felicitous, and forcible language in which to clothe his thoughts, no  one could doubt his meaning or withhold the tribute of wonder at his  power.\"    [Illustration: CHARLES KELLOGG FIELD.]    To clinch the evidence as to the source from which Eugene Field derived  pretty nearly everything that won for him such meed of fame as fell to  his lot, let me quote from an interview with Melvin L. Gray, his  guardian and foster-father, printed in the Helena Independent,  September 6th, 1895, shortly before his idol's death:    \"If I had never believed in the influence of heredity before, I would  now, after having known Eugene Field and his father before him. The  father was a lawyer of wonderful ability, but he was particularly  distinguished by his keen wit, his intense appreciation of the humorous  side of life, and his fondness for rare first editions of literary  works. He was a profound student, and found much time to cultivate the  fairer qualities that some lawyers neglect in the busy round of their  profession. Eugene is not a lawyer, but he has his father's tastes, his  father's keen wit, and much of the same fineness of character and  literary ability.\"    \"Another point of similarity is found in Eugene's neglect of financial  matters. In his youth the father was equally negligent, although he did  subsequently grow more thrifty, and when he died left the boys a little  patrimony. As executor I apportioned the money as directed. Both the  boys spent it freely while it lasted.\"    I find no trace in the father of what, all through life, was the  pre-eminent characteristic of Eugene, the inveterate painstaking,  mirth-compelling practical-joker. But in Brattleboro, Newfane, and  throughout Vermont everybody says, \"That's jest like his uncle Charles  Kellogg. There was never such another for jest foolin'. He'd rather  play a hoax on the parson that would embarrass him in the face of his  congregation than eat.\" When they were boys, it was Charles that led  Roswell into all kinds of mischief. \"Uncle Charles Kellogg\"--they  always give him the benefit of the second name in Brattleboro--had a  reputation for wit and never-ending badinage throughout the  neighborhood that still survives and leaves no room to question whence  Eugene inherited his unquenchable passion \"for jest foolin'.\"          CHAPTER IV    BIRTH AND EARLY YOUTH      For nine years after moving to St. Louis his profession was the sole  mistress of Roswell Field's \"laborious days\" and bachelor nights.  Almost coincident with his becoming interested in the case of the  slave, Dred Scott, he met, and more to the purpose of this narrative,  became interested in Miss Frances Reed, then of St. Louis, but whose  parents hailed from Windham County, Vermont. Whether their common  nativity, or the fact that her father was a professional musician,  first brought them together, the memory of St. Louis does not disclose.  Miss Reed was a young woman of unusual personal charm. All accounts  agree that she was quiet and refined in her ways and yet possessed that  firmness of mind that is the salt of a quiet nature. They were married  in May, 1848, and in the love and domestic happiness of his mature  manhood, Roswell Field found the sweet balm for the bitterness that  followed from his youthful romance and the nullification of the Putney  marriage.    Of this union six children were born in the eight years of Mrs. Field's  wedded life, only two of whom, Eugene, the second, and Roswell,  survived babyhood. There is some uncertainty as to the exact date and  location of Eugene's birth. When his father was married he took his  bride home to a house on Collins Street, which, under Time's  transmuting and ironical fingers, has since become a noisy boiler-shop.  There their first child was born. Subsequently they moved to the house,  No. 634 South Fifth Street (now Broadway), which is one in the middle  of a block of houses pointed out in St. Louis as the birthplace of  Eugene Field. Although Eugene himself went with the photographer and  pointed out the house, his brother Roswell strenuously maintains that  Eugene was born before the family moved to the Walsh row, so-called,  and that to the boiler-shop belongs the honor of having heard the first  lullabies that greeted the ears of their greatest master.    [Illustration: EUGENE FIELD'S MOTHER.  _From a daguerreotype taken a year or two before his birth._]    Roswell's view receives negative corroboration from the testimony of  Mrs. Temperance Moon, of Farmington, Utah, who for a time lived in  their father's family. Under date of February 25th, 1901, Mrs. Moon  wrote to me:    \"I can give you very little information in regard to Mr. Field's place  of birth. It was on Third Street. I do not remember the names of the  cross streets, I think Cherry was one. Eugene was four months old when  I went to live with them. I stayed until the family went east for the  summer. Mrs. Field's sister was living with them. Her name was Miss  Arabella Reed. When they came back Roswell was a few months old. They  went to live on Fifth Street in a three-story house. Mrs. Field sent  word for me to come and take care of Eugene. I was twelve years old.  She gave me full charge of him. I was very proud of the charge. He was  a noble child. I loved him as a dear brother. He took great delight in  hearing me read any kind of children's stories and fairy tales. His  mother was a lovely woman. I have a book and a picture Eugene sent to  me. The picture is of him and his mother when he was only six months  old.\"    Equal and illusive doubt hangs over the date of Eugene Field's birth.  Was it September 2d or 3d, 1850? In his \"Auto-Analysis,\" of which we  shall hear more further along, Field himself gives preference to the  latter figure. But as his preference more than half the time went by  the rule of contraries, that would be prima-facie evidence that he was  born on the earlier date. There again the testimony of the younger  brother is to the effect that in their youth the anniversary of Eugene's  birth was held to be September 2d. Their father said he could not  reconcile his mind to the thought that one of his children was born  on so memorable an anniversary as September 3d, the day of Cromwell's  death. I have little doubt that Field himself fostered the irrepressible  conflict of dates, on the theory that two birthdays a year afforded a  double opportunity to playfully remind his friends of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#8)"],[1," right?      Yours,      CHAS. BURKEY.    And by the same mail came this comforting epistle from the arch  conspirator:      CHICAGO, July the 22d, 1885.      DEAR SIR KNIGHT:      I have been too busy to reply to your many kind letters before this.    On receipt of your telegram last night, we went to Boyle's and had    sumptuous cheer at your expense. Charlie has begun to demur, and    intends to write you a letter. Browne wrote me a note the other day.    I enclose it to you. Please keep it for me. I hope your work will    pan out more successfully.      I had a long talk with Stone to-night, and churned him up about the    paper. He agreed with me in nearly all particulars. He is going to    fire W---- when D---- goes (August 1). He said, \"I am going to have a    lively shaking up at that time.\" One important change I am not at    liberty to specify, but you will approve it. By the way, Stone spoke    very highly of you and your work. It would be safe for you to strike    him on the salary question as soon as you please. The weather is    oppressively warm. Things run along about so so in the office.    Hawkins told me he woke up the other night, and could not go to sleep    again till he had sung a song. The Dutch girls at Henrici's inquire    tenderly for you.... Hastily yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    The note from Mr. Browne here mentioned related to the proposed  publication of a collection of Field's verse and stories. The Browne  was Francis F., for a long time editor of The Dial, and at that time  holding the position of principal reader for A.C. McClurg & Co. As I  remember, Mr. Browne was favorably disposed toward putting out a  volume of Field's writings, but General McClurg was not enamoured of  the breezy sort of personal persiflage with which Field's name was  then chiefly associated. This was several years before Field made the  Saints' and Sinners' Corner in McClurg's Chicago book-store famous  throughout the bibliomaniac world by fictitious reports relating to it  printed occasionally in his \"Sharps and Flats\" column. It was not  until 1893 that McClurg & Co. published any of Field's writings.    My work to which Field refers was the collection of newspaper and  periodical verse entitled \"The Humbler Poets,\" which McClurg & Co.  subsequently published.    Enclosed in the letter of July 22d was the following characteristic  account, conveying the impression that while he was willing to waste  all the resources of his colored inks and literary ingenuity on our  friendship, I must pay the freight. I think he had a superstition that  it would cause a flaw in his title of \"The Good Knight, _sans peur  et sans monnaie_\" if he were to add the price of a two-cent postage  stamp to that waste.

His brow was cool and his breath was free,      And his hands were soft as a lady's hands,    And a song of the booming waves sang he      As he launched his bark from the golden sands.      The grayling chuckled a hoarse \"ha-ha,\"      And the Cisco tittered a rude \"he-he\"--    But the Thompson merrily sang \"tra-la\"      As his bark bounced over the Northern Sea._      II.      _A Thompson came bobbling back into the bay--      Back into the bay as the Sun sank low,    And the people knew there was hell to pay,      For HE wasn't the first who had come back so.      His nose was skinned and his spine was sore,      And the blisters speckled his hands so white--    He had lost his hat and had dropped an oar,      And his bosom-shirt was a sad sea sight.      And the grayling chuckled again \"ha-ha,\"      And the Cisco tittered a harsh \"ho-ho\"--    But the Thompson anchored furninst a bar      And called for a schooner to drown his woe._    During the fall of 1885 I was again sent East on some political work  that took me to Saratoga and New York. As usual, Field was unremitting  in his epistolary attentions with which I will not weary the reader.  But on the journey back from New York they afforded entertainment and  almost excited the commiseration of a young lady travelling home under  my escort. When we reached Chicago I casually remarked that if she was  so moved by Field's financial straits I would take pleasure in  conveying as much truage to the impecunious knight as would provide  him with buttered toast, coffee, and pie at Henrici's. She accordingly  entrusted me with a quarter of a dollar, which I was to deliver with  every assurance of her esteem and sympathy. As I was pledged not to  reveal the donor's name, this tribute of silver provided Field with  another character, whom he named \"The Fair Unknown,\" and to whom he  indited several touching ballads, of which the first was:      _THE GOOD KNIGHT AND THE FAIR UNKNOWN      Now, once when this good knight was broke    And all his chattels were in soak,        The brave Sir Thompson came    And saith: \"I' faith accept this loan    Of silver from a fair unknown--        But do not ask her name!\"      The Good Knight dropped his wassail cup    And took the proffered bauble up,        And cautiously he bit    Its surface, but it would not yield,    Which did convince the grand old Field        It was not counterfeit.      Then quoth the Good Knight, as he wept:    \"Soothly this boon I must accept,        Else would I sore offend    The doer of this timely deed,    The nymph who would allay my need--        My fair but unknown friend.      \"But take to her, O gallant knight,    This signet with my solemn plight        To seek her presence straight,    When varlets or a caitiff crew    Resolved some evil deed to do--        Besiege her castle gate.      \"Then when her faithful squire shall bring    To him who sent this signet ring        Invoking aid of me--    Lo, by my faith, with this good sword    Will I disperse the base-born horde        And set the princess free!      \"And yet, Sir Thompson, if I send    This signet to my unknown friend,        I jeopardize my life;    For this fair signet which you see,    Odds bobs, doth not belong to me,        But to my brawny wife!      \"I should not risk so sweet a thing    As my salvation for a ring,        And all through jealous spite!    Haste to the fair unknown and say    You lost the ring upon the way--        Come, there's a courteous Knight!\"      Eftsoons he spake, the Good Knight drew    His visor down, and waving to        Sir Thompson fond farewell,    He leapt upon his courser fleet    And crossed the drawbridge to the street        Which was ycleped La Salle._    Another bit of verse was inspired by this incident which is worth  preserving: One night I was dining at the house of a friend on the  North Side where the \"Fair Unknown\" was one of the company--a fact of  which Field only became possessed when I left the office late in the  afternoon. The dinner had not progressed quite to the withdrawal of  the ladies when, with some confusion, one of the waiting-men brought  in and gave to me a large packet from the office marked \"Personal;  deliver at once.\" Thinking it had something to do with work for the  Morning News, I asked to be excused and hastily tore the enclosure  open. One glance was enough to disclose its nature. It was a poem from  Field, neatly arranged in the form of a pamphlet, with an illustration  by Sclanders. The outside, which was in the form of a title page, ran  thus:      HOW THE GOOD KNIGHT ATTENDED UPON SIR SLOSSON:      BEING A WOEFUL TALE    OF    THE MOST JOYOUS AND DIVERTING DAYS      WHEREIN      KNIGHTS ERRANT DID COURTEOUSLY    DISPORT THEMSELVES    AND ACHIEVE PRODIGIES OF VALOR,      AND      MARVELS OF SWEET FRIENDSHIP.    And inside the plaintive story was told in variegated ink in the  following lines:      _One chilly raw November night    Beneath a dull electric light,          At half-past ten o'clock,    The Good Knight, wan and hungry, stood,    And in a half-expectant mood          Peered up and down the block.      The smell of viands floated by    The Good Knight from a basement nigh          And tantalized his soul.    Keenly his classic, knightly nose    Envied the fragrance that arose          From many a steaming bowl.      Pining for stews not brewed for him,    The Good Knight stood there gaunt and grim--          A paragon of woe;    And muttered in a chiding tone,    \"Odds bobs! Sir Slosson must have known          'Twas going to rain or snow!\"      But while the Good and Honest Knight    Flocked by himself in sorry plight,          Sir Slosson did regale    Himself within a castle grand--    of the Good Knight and          His wonted stoup of ale.      Mid joyous knights and ladies fair    He little recked the evening air          Blew bitterly without;    Heedless of pelting storms that came    To drench his friend's dyspeptic frame,          He joined the merry rout.      But underneath the corner light    Lingered the impecunious Knight--          Wet, hungry and alone--    Hoping that from Sir Slosson some    Encouragement mayhap would come,          Or from the Fair Unknown._    The drawing in this verse marks the beginning of the transfer of our  patronage from the steaks and gamblers' frowns of Billy Boyle's to  the oysters and the cricket's friendly chirps of the Boston Oyster  House. The reference to Field's \"dyspeptic frame\" is not without its"]]]
