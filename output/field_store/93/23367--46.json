The organized Labour party strives after an ideal whose realization is  only conceivable when the rate of wages and the hours of work are  settled internationally for the whole industrial world, and when the  cost of living is everywhere uniformly regulated. Until this is the case  the prices of the international market determine the standard of wages.  The nation which leaves this out of account, and tries to settle  independently wages and working hours, runs the risk of losing its  position in the international market in competition with nations who  work longer hours and at lower rates. Want of employment and extreme  misery among the working classes would inevitably be the result. On the  other hand, the internationalization of industries would soon, by  excluding and preventing any competition, produce a deterioration of  products and a profound demoralization of the working population.    The case of the scheme for universal peace is similar. Its execution, as  we saw, would be only feasible in a world empire, and this is as  impossible as the uniform regulation of the world's industries. A State  which disregarded the differently conceived notions of neighbouring  countries, and wished to make the idea of universal peace the guiding  rule for its policy, would only inflict a fatal injury on itself, and  become the prey of more resolute and warlike neighbours.    We can, fortunately, assert the impossibility of these efforts after  peace ever attaining their ultimate object in a world bristling with  arms, where a healthy egotism still directs the policy of most  countries. \"God will see to it,\" says Treitschke,[I] \"that war always  recurs as a drastic medicine for the human race!\"    [Footnote I: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p. 76.]    Nevertheless, these tendencies spell for us in Germany no inconsiderable  danger. We Germans are inclined to indulge in every sort of unpractical  dreams. \"The accuracy of the national instinct is no longer a universal  attribute with us, as in France.\" [J] We lack the true feeling for  political exigencies. A deep social and religious gulf divides the  German people into different political groups, which are bitterly  antagonistic to each other. The traditional feuds in the political world  still endure. The agitation for peace introduces a new element of  weakness, dissension, and indecision, into the divisions of our national  and party life.    [Footnote J: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p. 81.]    It is indisputable that many supporters of these ideas sincerely believe  in the possibility of their realization, and are convinced that the  general good is being advanced by them. Equally true is it, however,  that this peace movement is often simply used to mask intensely selfish  political projects. Its apparent humanitarian idealism constitutes its  danger.    Every means must therefore be employed to oppose these visionary  schemes. They must be publicly denounced as what they really are--as an  unhealthy and feeble Utopia, or a cloak for political machinations. Our  people must learn to see that _the maintenance of peace never can or may  be the goal of a policy_. The policy of a great State has positive aims.  It will endeavour to attain this by pacific measures so long as that is  possible and profitable. It must not only be conscious that in momentous  questions which influence definitely the entire development of a nation,  the appeal to arms is a sacred right of the State, but it must keep this  conviction fresh in the national consciousness. The inevitableness, the  idealism, and the blessing of war, as an indispensable and stimulating  law of development, must be repeatedly emphasized. The apostles of the  peace idea must be confronted with Goethe's manly words:      \"Dreams of a peaceful day?    Let him dream who may!    'War' is our rallying cry,    Onward to victory!\"          CHAPTER II        THE DUTY TO MAKE WAR    Prince Bismarck repeatedly declared before the German Reichstag that no  one should ever take upon himself the immense responsibility of  intentionally bringing about a war. It could not, he said, be foreseen  what unexpected events might occur, which altered the whole situation,  and made a war, with its attendant dangers and horrors, superfluous. In  his \"Thoughts and Reminiscences\" he expresses himself to this effect:  \"Even victorious wars can only be justified when they are forced upon a  nation, and we cannot see the cards held by Providence so closely as to  anticipate the historical development by personal calculation.\" [A]    [Footnote A: \"Gedanken und Erinnerungen,\" vol. ii., p. 93.]    We need not discuss whether Prince Bismarck wished this dictum to be  regarded as a universally applicable principle, or whether he uttered it  as a supplementary explanation of the peace policy which he carried out  for so long. It is difficult to gauge its true import. The notion of  forcing a war upon a nation bears various interpretations. We must not  think merely of external foes who compel us to fight. A war may seem to  be forced upon a statesman by the state of home affairs, or by the  pressure of the whole political situation.    Prince Bismarck did not, however, always act according to the strict  letter of that speech; it is his special claim to greatness that at the  decisive moment he did not lack the boldness to begin a war on his own  initiative. The thought which he expresses in his later utterances  cannot, in my opinion, be shown to be a universally applicable principle  of political conduct. If we wish to regard it as such, we shall not only  run counter to the ideas of our greatest German Prince, but we exclude  from politics that independence of action which is the true motive  force.    The greatness of true statesmanship consists in a knowledge of the  natural trend of affairs, and in a just appreciation of the value of the  controlling forces, which it uses and guides in its own interest. It  does not shrink from the conflicts, which under the given conditions are  unavoidable, but decides them resolutely by war when a favourable  position affords prospect of a successful issue. In this way statecraft  becomes a tool of Providence, which employs the human will to attain its  ends. \"Men make history,\" [B] as Bismarck's actions clearly show.    [Footnote B: Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte,\" i., p. 28.]    No doubt the most strained political situation may unexpectedly admit of  a peaceful solution. The death of some one man, the setting of some  great ambition, the removal of some master-will, may be enough to change  it fundamentally. But the great disputes in the life of a nation cannot  be settled so simply. The man who wished to bring the question to a  decisive issue may disappear, and the political crisis pass for the  moment; the disputed points still exist, and lead once more to quarrels,  and finally to war, if they are due to really great and irreconcilable  interests. With the death of King Edward VII. of England the policy of  isolation, which he introduced with much adroit statesmanship against  Germany, has broken down. The antagonism of Germany and England, based  on the conflict of the interests and claims of the two nations, still  persists, although the diplomacy which smoothes down, not always  profitably, all causes of difference has succeeded in slackening the  tension for the moment, not without sacrifices on the side of Germany.    It is clearly an untenable proposition that political action should  depend on indefinite possibilities. A completely vague factor would be  thus arbitrarily introduced into politics, which have already many  unknown quantities to reckon with; they would thus be made more or less  dependent on chance.    It may be, then, assumed as obvious that the great practical politician  Bismarck did not wish that his words on the political application of war  should be interpreted in the sense which has nowadays so frequently been  attributed to them, in order to lend the authority of the great man to a  weak cause. Only those conditions which can be ascertained and estimated  should determine political action.    For the moral justification of the political decision we must not look  to its possible consequences, but to its aim and its motives, to the  conditions assumed by the agent, and to the trustworthiness, honour, and  sincerity of the considerations which led to action. Its practical value  is determined by an accurate grasp of the whole situation, by a correct  estimate of the resources of the two parties, by a clear anticipation of  the probable results--in short, by statesmanlike insight and promptness  of decision.    If the statesman acts in this spirit, he will have an acknowledged  right, under certain circumstances, to begin a war, regarded as  necessary, at the most favourable moment, and to secure for his country  the proud privilege of such initiative. If a war, on which a Minister  cannot willingly decide, is bound to be fought later under possibly far  more unfavourable conditions, a heavy responsibility for the greater  sacrifices that must then be made will rest on those whose strength and  courage for decisive political action failed at the favourable moment.  In the face of such considerations a theory by which a war ought never  to be brought about falls to the ground. And yet this theory has in our  day found many supporters, especially in Germany.    Even statesmen who consider that the complete abolition of war is  impossible, and do not believe that the _ultima ratio_ can be banished  from the life of nations, hold the opinion that its advent should be  postponed so long as possible.[C]    [Footnote C: Speech of the Imperial Chancellor, v. Bethmann-Hollweg, on  March 30, 1911. In his speech of November 9, 1911, the Imperial  Chancellor referred to the above-quoted words of Prince Bismarck  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#8)"],[1,", the name lady fern will not change, but everywhere within  our limits it will hold its own as a familiar term.    Underwood, writing of the lady fern under the genus _Asplenium_, mentions  the form \"_exile_, small, starved specimens growing in very dry situations  and often fruiting when only a few inches high.\" He also mentions Eaton's  \"_angustum_,\" and alludes to the \"Remaining sixty-three varieties equally  unimportant that have been described of this species.\"    The lady fern is common in moist woods, by walls and roadsides, and at its  best is a truly handsome species, although, like Mrs. Parsons, we have  noticed that in the late summer it loses much of its delicacy. \"Many of  its forms become disfigured and present a rather blotched and coarse  appearance.\" The lady fern has inspired several poems, which have been  quoted more or less fully in the fern books. The following lines are from  the pen of Calder Campbell:      \"But not by burne in wood or dale    Grows anything so fair    As the palmy crest of emerald pale    Of the lady fern when the sunbeams turn    To gold her delicate hair.\"    Referring, perhaps, to the fair colors of the unfolding crosiers revealing  stipes of a clear wine color in striking contrast with the delicate green  of the foliage.    In identifying this fern the novice should bear in mind the tendency of the  curved sori of youth to become straightened and even confluent with age,  although such changes are rather unreliable. Possibly the suggestion of the  poetic Davenport may be helpful to some that there is \"An indefinable charm  about the various forms of the lady fern, which soon enables one to know it  from its peculiarly graceful motion by merely gently swaying a frond in the  hand.\" Spores ripen in August.    The lady fern is very easy to cultivate and when once established is apt to  crowd aside its neighbors.    (3) SILVERY SPLEENWORT. ATHYRIUM ACROSTICHOIDES    _Asplenium acrostichoides. Asplenium thelypteroides_    Fronds two to four feet tall, pinnate, tapering both ways from the middle.  Pinnae deeply pinnatifid, linear-lanceolate, acuminate. Lobes oblong,  obtuse, minutely toothed, each bearing two rows of oblong or linear  fruit-dots. Indusium silvery when young.    [Illustration: Silvery Spleenwort. _Athyrium acrostichoides_]    [Illustration: Silvery Spleenwort. Athyrium acrostichoides]    The sterile fronds come up first and the taller, fertile ones do not appear  until late in June. Where there are no fruit-dots the hairs on the upper  surface of the fronds will help to distinguish it from specimens of the  Marsh fern tribe, which it somewhat resembles. The regular rows of nearly  straight, clear-cut sori of the fertile fronds are very attractive, and  the lower ones, as well as those at the slender tips of the pinnae, are  frequently double.    Rich woods and moist, shady banks, New England to Kentucky and westward.  Generally distributed but hardly common.    (4) NARROW-LEAVED SPLEENWORT    ATHYRIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM. _Asplenium angustifolium_    Fronds one to four feet tall, pinnate. Pinnae numerous, thin, short-stalked,  linear-lanceolate, acuminate, those of the fertile fronds narrower.  Fruit-dots linear. Indusium slightly convex.    [Illustration: Narrow-leaved Spleenwort. _Athyrium angustifolium_ (Vermont)  (Geo. E. Davenport)]    In rich woods from southern Canada and New Hampshire to Minnesota and  southward. September. Not common. Mt. Toby, Mass., Berlin and Meriden,  Conn., and Danville, Vt. Can be cultivated but should not be exposed to  severe weather, as its thin and delicate fronds are easily injured. Woolson  writes of it, \"There is nothing in the fern kingdom which looks so cool and  refreshing on a hot day as a mass of this clear-cut, delicately made-up  fern.\"    [Illustration: Pinnae and Sori of _Athyrium angustifolium_]          HART'S TONGUE    _Scolopendrium_. PHYLLITIS    Sori linear, a row on either side of the midvein, and at right angles to  it, the indusium appearing to be double. (_Scolopendrium_ is the Greek for  centipede, whose feet the sori were thought to resemble. _Phyllitis_ is the  ancient Greek name for a fern.) Only one species in the United States.    [Illustration: Sori of _Scolopendrium vulgare_]    (1) _Scolopendrium vulgare_    PHYLLITIS SCOLOPENDRIUM    Fronds thick and leathery, oblong-lanceolate from an auricled, heart-shaped  base, ten to twenty inches long and one to two inches wide. Margin entire,  bright green.    In shaded ravines under limestone cliffs. Chittenango Falls, and  Scolopendrium Lake, central New York, and Tennessee. Also, locally in  Ontario and New Brunswick. One of the rarest of our native ferns, although  very common in Great Britain. This plant is said to be easily cultivated,  and to produce numerous varieties. According to Woolson, \"No rockery is  complete without the Hart's Tongue, the long, glossy, undulating fronds  of which are sufficiently unique to distinguish any collection.\" In  cultivation it \"needs light protection through the winter in northern New  England.\"    [Illustration: Hart's Tongue. _Scolopendrium vulgare_ (Base of calcareous  rocks, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada)]      WALKING FERN. WALKING LEAF    _Camptosorus_    Fruit-dots oblong or linear as in _Asplenium_, but irregularly scattered on  either side of the reticulated veins of the simple frond, the outer ones  sometimes confluent at their ends, forming crooked lines (hence, the name  from the Greek meaning crooked sori). Only one species within our limits.    _Camptosorus rhizophyllus_    Fronds evergreen, leathery, four to eighteen inches long, heart-shaped at  the base, but tapering towards the apex, which often roots and forms a  new plant. Veins reticulated. The auricles of this species are sometimes  elongated and may even take root.    This curious and interesting fern is one of the finest for rockeries, the  tips taking root in rock-fissures. Shaded limestone, or sometimes other  rocks. Shapleigh and Winthrop, Me., rarely in New Hampshire (Lebanon),  and Connecticut, Mt. Toby, Mass., and western New England; also Canada to  Georgia and westward.    [Illustration: Walking Fern. _Camptosorus rhizophyllus_]          THE SHIELD FERNS      THE CHRISTMAS AND HOLLY FERNS    _Polystichum_    These have been grouped with the wood ferns, but are now usually placed  under the genus _Polystichum_, which has the sori round and covered with  a circular indusium fixed to the frond by its depressed center. The wood  ferns, on the other hand, have a kidney-shaped indusium attached to the  fronds by the sinus. (_Polystichum_ is the Greek for many rows, the sori of  some species being in many ranks.)    (1) THE CHRISTMAS FERN    _Polystichum acrostichoides. Aspidium acrostichoides_    Stipes clothed with pale, brown scales. Frond rigid and evergreen, one to  two feet long, lanceolate, pinnate. Pinnae linear-lanceolate, scythe-shaped,  auricled on the upper side, and with bristly teeth; fertile pinnae  contracted toward the top, bearing two rows of sori, which soon become  confluent and cover the entire surface. Indusium orbicular, fixed by its  depressed center.    _F. incisum_ is a form in which the pinnae are much incised.    _F. crispum_ has the edges of its pinnae crisped and ruffled. The name  Christmas fern, due to John Robinson, of Salem, Mass., suggests its fitness  for winter decoration. Its deep green and glossy fronds insure it a welcome  at Christmas time. \"Its mission is to cheer the winter months and enhance  the beauty of the other ferns by contrast.\" In transplanting, a generous  mass of earth should be included and its roots should not be disturbed.    [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_]    [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_]    [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_ Top, Forked  Form; Bottom, Incised Form (Maine)]    (2) BRAUN'S HOLLY FERN    _Polystichum Braunii. Aspidium aculeatum Braunii_    Fronds thick, rigid, one to two feet long, spreading, lanceolate,  tapering both ways, bipinnate. Pinnules ovate or oblong, truncate, nearly  rectangular at the base, sharply toothed and covered beneath with chaff and  hairs. Fruit-dots small and near the mid veins. Indusium orbicular, entire.  Stipes chaffy with brown scales.    [Illustration: Braun's Holly Fern. _Polystichum Braunii_ (Willoughby  Mountain, Vt.) (Herbarium of G.H.T.)]    This handsome fern is rather common in northern New England. We have  collected it in the Willoughby Lake region, Vt., and it is found at Mt.  Mansfield, Randolph, and elsewhere in that state; also at Gorham, N.H.,  and Fernald reports it as common in northern Maine. It also grows in the  mountains of New York and Pennsylvania, and westward. It was formerly  thought to be a variety of the prickly shield fern (_P. aculeatum_), which  has a very wide range and numerous varieties. The fronds remain green  through the winter but the stipes weaken and fall over.    (3) HOLLY FERN. _Polystichum Lonchitis_    Fronds linear-lanceolate, short-stalked and rigid, eight to fifteen inches  long. Pinnae broadly lanceolate-falcate or the lowest triangular, strongly  auricled on the upper side, densely spinulose-toothed. Sori midway between  the margin and midrib.    [Illustration: Holly Fern. Polystichum Lonchitis (Nottawasaga, Canada,  West, Right, Alaska, Left) (Herbarium of C.E. Davenport)]    The name holly fern suggests its resemblance to holly leaves with their  bristle-tipped teeth. The specific name lonchitis (like a spear) refers to  its sharp teeth. A northern species growing in rocky woods from Labrador  to Alaska, and south to Niagara Falls, Lake Superior and westward. Its  southern limits nearly coincide with the northern limits of the Christmas  fern.
