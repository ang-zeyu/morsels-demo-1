The frequent and unrestrained passing  and repassing of idle and disorderly people from one part of the colony  to another, and the mischievous correspondence which was kept up by such  means, was productive of great evil. To check this as much as possible,  all persons, the officers excepted, who were travelling from one district  of the settlement to another, were required to furnish themselves with a  passport, which, on a proper application, they would obtain without any  difficulty. This was to be shown to and inspected by the constables in  each district; and if found without it they were to be imprisoned during  a month for the first offence, and otherwise punished if it was repeated.  But the best local arrangements were set at defiance by those hardened  vagabonds, who seemed daily to increase in number and in infamy.    While the governor was endeavouring to guard against the injuries that  might be done by these people, the settlers found themselves obliged to  assemble for the purpose of repelling the attacks made upon them by the  natives. The people at the northern farms had been repeatedly plundered  of their provisions and clothing by a large body of savages, who had also  recently killed a man and a woman. Exasperated at such cruel and wanton  conduct, they armed themselves, and, after pursuing them a whole night,  at sun-rise in the morning came up with a party of more than a hundred,  who fled immediately on discovering that their pursuers were armed,  leaving behind them a quantity of Indian corn, some musket balls, and  other things of which the soldiers had been plundered. They continued to  follow, and traced them as far as the outskirts of Parramatta. Being  fatigued with their march, they entered the town, and in about an hour  after were followed by a large body of natives, headed by Pe-mul-wy, a  riotous and troublesome savage. These were known by the settlers to be  the same who had so frequently annoyed them; and they intended, if  possible, to seize upon Pe-mul-wy; who, in a great rage, threatened to  spear the first man that dared to approach him, and actually did throw a  spear at one of the soldiers. The conflict was now begun; a musket was  immediately levelled at the principal, which severely wounded him. Many  spears were then thrown, and one man was hit in the arm; upon which the  superior effect of our fire-arms was immediately shown them, and five  were instantly killed.    However unpleasant it was to the governor, that the lives of so many of  these people should have been taken, no other course could possibly be  pursued; for it was their custom, when they found themselves more  numerous and better armed than the white people, to demand with insolence  whatever they wanted; and, if refused, to have recourse to murder. This  check, it was hoped, would have a good effect; and Pe-mul-wy, who had  received seven buck shot in his head and different parts of his body, was  taken extremely ill to the hospital. This man was first known in the  settlement by the murder of* John McIntire in the year 1790; since which  he had been a most active enemy to the settlers, plundering them of their  property, and endangering their personal safety.    [* Vide Vol I Ch. XI viz: 'On the 10th, John McIntire, a convict  who was employed by the governor to shoot for him, was dangerously  wounded by a native named Pe-mul-wy, while in quest of game in  the woods at some considerable distance from the settlement. When  brought in he declared, and at a time when he thought himself dying, that  he did not give any offence to the man who wounded him; that he had even  quitted his arms, to induce him to look upon him as a friend, when the  savage threw his spear at about the distance of ten yards with a skill  that was fatally unerring. When the spear was extracted, which was not  until suppuration took place, it was found to have entered his body under  the left arm, to the depth of seven inches and a half. It was armed for  five or six inches from the point with ragged pieces of shells fastened  in gum. His recovery was immediately pronounced by Mr. White to be very  doubtful'.]    The people belonging to the crown were employed during this month in the  following several works: At Toongabbie, upwards of 100 men were occupied  in agriculture--a wind-mill was to be erected at Parramatta, where  stone-masons and carpenters were preparing the materials. At Sydney, a  gang was employed in making bricks, where also were completing a large  granary and a strong log-prison. All the public brick buildings were  likewise undergoing a repair, being crumbling into ruins; such as the  barracks for the military, storehouses, officers' dwellings and others.  Some people were also repairing the boats belonging to government; and  bricks were bringing in for the barracks of the assistant surgeons (this  part of the public labour was performed by a team of oxen). A new  flag-staff was prepared and erected at the South Head during this month,  the weather of which had for the greater part been very wet.

The people were  directed, if possible, to bring her away, unless she preferred the life  that she now led; upon which more than three years' experience of it  would certainly enable her to decide. They were absent about 10 days,  and returned without success, not even having heard any thing of her.*  They went into the north arm of Broken Bay, and travelled to the northward  as far as Cape Three Points; between which and the north head of Broken  Bay, is a lagoon within the sea beach, of about twenty miles in length,  and running parallel with the sea coast.    [* Nor indeed could they very well; for at the time when this  search was making after her in New South Wales she was leading a life in  London, which she most certainly preferred to the society of either the  black or white people in that country. She was taken from the settlement  by Locke, the master of the _Resolution_, in the year 1794.    Vide Vol I Ch. XXVII Page 332, viz: 'On the morning of the 9th the ships  _Resolution_ and _Salamander_ left the cove, purposing to sail  on their fishing voyage; soon after which, it being discovered that three  convicts, Mary Morgan and John Randall and his wife, were missing, a boat  was sent down the harbour to search the _Resolution_, on board of  which ship it was said they were concealed. No person being found, the  boat returned for further orders, leaving a sergeant and four men on  board; but before she could return, Mr. Locke the master, after forcing  the party out of his ship, got under way and stood out to sea. Mr. Irish,  the master of the _Salamander_, did not accompany him; but came up  to the town, to testify to the lieutenant-governor his uneasiness at its  being supposed that he could be capable of taking any person improperly  from the colony.' and    Vol. I Ch. XXXII Page 406, viz:'The natives appeared less troublesome  lately than they had been for some time past. The people of a  fishing-boat, which had been cast on shore in some bad weather near Port  Stephens, met with some of these people, who without much entreaty, or  any hope of reward, readily put them into a path from thence to Broken  Bay, and conducted them the greatest part of the way. During their little  journey, these friendly people made them understand, that they had seen a  white woman among some natives to the northward. On their reporting this  at Sydney, this unfortunate female was conjectured to be Mary Morgan, a  prisoner, who it was now said had failed in her attempt to get on board  the _Resolution_ store-ship, which sailed from hence in 1794. There  was indeed a woman, one Ann Smith, who ran away a few days after our  sitting down in this place, and whose fate was not exactly ascertained;  if she could have survived the hardships and wretchedness of such a life  as must have been hers during so many years residence among the natives  of New Holland, how much information must it have been in her power to  afford! But humanity shuddered at the idea of purchasing it at so dear a  price.']    A decked long boat, having been sent from Sydney to Norfolk island, in  her passage thither fell in with a considerable shoal bearing from ENE to  WNW distant from the vessel one mile. It extended to the northward as far  as the eye could discern from the masthead, the rocks in many places  appearing above the water. The south end of the shoal is in the latitude  of 29 degrees 52 minutes south, and the longitude of 160 degrees 13  minutes east, bearing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#8)"],[1,"loss of the box was certainly to be  regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or  other. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not  a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate,  there was only one thing to be done--to await the return of Neb and the  reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had  meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect  either for themselves or for the others.    Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of  fire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and  then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.    Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He  even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle  where the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it  in every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the  forest, all in vain.    It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave.  It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were  ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards  six o'clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the  west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the  return of Neb and Spilett.    They were returning alone!... The boy's heart sank; the sailor had not  been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not  been found!    The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying  anything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength  to utter a word.    As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he  could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.    The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to  recover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance  of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon  had fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the  disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary;  not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a  trace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach.  It was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by  a human being. The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there,  a few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a  tomb.    As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which  showed how hope struggled within him, \"No! he is not dead! he can't be  dead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get  out of anything!\" Then his strength forsaking him, \"Oh! I can do no  more!\" he murmured.    \"Neb,\" said Herbert, running to him, \"we will find him! God will give  him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat  something.\"    So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which  was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything  for several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live  without his master.    As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself  down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm.  Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, \"Sir,\" said he, \"we  have found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is  advancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther.\"    The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On  the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he  happened to have a match or two.    The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, \"I  had some, but I must have thrown them away.\"    The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same  answer.    \"Confound it!\" exclaimed the sailor.    The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, \"Have you no matches?\" he  asked.    \"Not one, and no fire in consequence.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Neb, \"if my master was here, he would know what to do!\"    The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.  Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, \"Mr. Spilett,  you are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven't  looked well, try again, a single match will be enough!\"    The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and  great-coat, and at last to Pencroft's great joy, no less to his extreme  surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his  waistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could  not get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great  importance not to rub off the phosphorus.    \"Will you let me try?\" said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking  it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood  which was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Pencroft; \"it is as good as having a whole cargo!\" He  took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.    This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are  wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the  greatest caution.    The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, \"We must  have some paper,\" said he.    \"Here,\" replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his  note-book.    Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and  knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry  moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the  air could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.    Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as  smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a  small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart,  holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did  not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to  rub off the phosphorus.    \"No, I can't do it,\" said he, \"my hand trembles, the match has missed  fire; I cannot, I will not!\" and rising, he told Herbert to take his  place.    Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus  going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He  did not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.    A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making  a choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the  flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds  too caught fire, and then the moss.    A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted  by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the  darkness.    \"At last!\" cried Pencroft, getting up; \"I was never so nervous before in  all my life!\"    The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily  out at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was  not long in being felt.    They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to  keep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had  plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.    Pencroft's first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more  nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were  brought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these  preparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his  mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had  survived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of  making known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore.  He was like a body without a soul.    Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no  choice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under  the hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman  invited the reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the  first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs  were excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man's  nourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were  much strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing  at this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been  all there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire  on the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven!  But the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned  chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even  obtained a burial-place.    Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard  the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking  on the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a  deafening noise.    The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down  the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the  loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the  matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his  sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he  passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not  spare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The  inconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions  could say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on  the shore calling on his master.
