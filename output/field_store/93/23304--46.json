[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#7)"],[1," and Elsie intensely  enjoyed her pleasure and admiration.    Then came a round of parties, which Elsie thought extremely tiresome,  as she could have no share in them, and was thus deprived of the  company of her papa and mamma almost every evening for several weeks.  But at last that too was over, and they settled down into a quiet,  home life, that suited them all much better, for neither Mr. Dinsmore  nor Rose was very fond of gayety.    And now Elsie resumed her studies regularly, reciting as before to  her father; while Rose undertook to instruct her in the more feminine  branches of housekeeping and needlework, and a master came from the  city several times a week to give her lessons in music and drawing.  She had been so long without regular employment that she found it very  difficult at first to give her mind to her studies, as she had done  in former days; but her father, though kind and considerate, was  very firm with her, and she soon fell into the traces and worked as  diligently as ever.    Elsie did not find that her father's marriage brought any  uncomfortable change to her. There was no lessening of his love or  care; she saw as much of him as before, had full possession of her  seat upon his knee, and was caressed and fondled quite as often and as  tenderly as ever.    And added to all this were Rose's love and sweet companionship, which  were ever grateful to the little girl, whether they were alone or with  her father. Elsie loved her new mamma dearly and was as respectful  and obedient to her as to her father, though Rose never assumed any  authority; which, however, was entirely unnecessary, as a wish or  request from her was sure to be attended to as if it had been a  command.    And Rose was very happy in her new home. Mr. Dinsmore's family were  pleased with the match and treated her most kindly, while he was  always affectionate, thoughtful, and attentive; not less devoted as  a husband than as a father. They were well suited in taste and  disposition; seldom had the slightest disagreement on any subject, and  neither had ever cause to regret the step they had taken, for each day  they lived together seemed but to increase their love for each other,  and for their little daughter, as Mr. Dinsmore delighted to call her,  always giving Rose a share in the ownership.          CHAPTER IV.      Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth    What joy is welcomed like a new-born child?      --MRS. NORTON.      \"Massa wants you for to come right along to him in de study, darlin',  jis as soon as your ole mammy kin get you dressed,\" said Chloe, one  morning to her nursling.    \"What for, mammy?\" Elsie asked curiously, for she noticed an odd  expression on her nurse's face.    \"Massa didn't tell me nuffin 'bout what he wanted, an' I spects you'll  have to az hisself,\" replied Chloe evasively.    Elsie's curiosity was excited, and she hastened to the study as soon  as possible. Her father laid down his paper as she entered, and held  out his hand with a smile as he bade her good-morning, and it struck  her that there was an odd twinkle in his eye also, while she was  certain that she could not be mistaken in the unusually joyous  expression of his countenance.    \"Good-morning, papa. But where is mamma?\" she asked, glancing about  the room in search of her.    \"She is not up yet, but do you sit down here in your little rocking  chair. I have something for you.\"    He left the room as he spoke, returning again in a moment, carrying  what Elsie thought was a strange-looking bundle.    \"There! hold out your arms,\" he said; and placing it in them, he  gently raised one corner of the blanket, displaying to her astonished  view a tiny little face.    \"A baby! Oh, the dear little thing!\" she exclaimed in tones of  rapturous delight. Then looking up into his face, \"Did you say I might  have it, papa? whose baby is it?\"    \"Ours; your mamma's and my son, and your brother,\" he answered, gazing  down with intense pleasure at her bright, happy face, sparkling all  over with delight.    \"My little brother! my darling little brother,\" she murmured looking  down at it again, and venturing to press her lips gently to its soft  velvet cheek. \"Oh, papa, I am so glad, so glad! I have so wanted a  little brother or sister. Is not God very good to give him to us,  papa?\" And happy, grateful tears were trembling in the soft eyes as  she raised them to his face again.    \"Yes,\" he said, bending down and kissing first her cheek, and then the  babe's, \"I feel that God has indeed been very good to me in bestowing  upon me two such treasures as these.\"    \"What is his name, papa?\" she asked.    \"He has none yet, my dear.\"    \"Then, papa, do let him be named Horace, for you; won't you if mamma  is willing? And then I hope he will grow up to be just like you; as  handsome and as good.\"    \"I should like him to be a great deal better, daughter,\" he answered  with a grave smile; \"and about the name--I don't know yet; I should  prefer some other, but your mamma seems to want that, and I suppose  she has the best right to name him; but we will see about it.\"    \"Better give little marster to me now, Miss Elsie,\" remarked his  nurse, stepping up, \"I reckon your little arms begin to feel tired.\"  And taking the babe she carried him from the room.    Nothing could have better pleased Mr. Dinsmore than Elsie's joyous  welcome to her little brother; though it was scarcely more than he had  expected.    \"My own darling child; my dear, dear little daughter,\" he said, taking  her in his arms and kissing her again and again. \"Elsie, dearest, you  are very precious to your father's heart.\"    \"Yes, papa, I know it,\" she replied, twining her arms about his neck,  and laying her cheek to his; \"I know you love me dearly, and it makes  me so very happy.\"    \"May I go in to see mamma?\" she asked presently.    \"No, darling, not yet; she is not able to see you; but she sends her  love, and hopes she may be well enough to receive a visit from you  to-morrow.\"    \"Poor mamma! I am sorry she is ill,\" she said sorrowfully; \"but I will  try to keep everything very quiet that she may not be disturbed.\"    That evening, after tea, Elsie was told that she would be allowed to  speak to her mamma for a moment if she chose, and she gladly availed  herself of the privilege.    \"Dear Elsie,\" Rose whispered, drawing Her down to kiss her cheek, \"I  am so glad you are pleased with your little brother.\"    \"Oh, mamma, he is such a dear little fellow!\" Elsie answered eagerly;  \"and now, if you will only get well we will be happier than ever.\"    Rose smiled and said she hoped soon to be quite well again, and then  Mr. Dinsmore led Elsie from the room.    Rose was soon about again and in the enjoyment of her usual health and  strength. Elsie's delight knew no bounds the first time her mamma  was able to leave her room, and take her place at the table with her  father and herself. She doted on her little brother, and, if allowed,  would have had him in her arms more than half the time; but he was a  plump little fellow, and soon grew so large and heavy that her father  forbade her carrying him lest she should injure herself; but she would  romp and play with him by the hour while he was in the nurse's arms,  or seated on the bed; and when any of her little friends called, she  could not be satisfied to let them go away without seeing the baby.    The first time Mr. Travilla called, after little Horace's arrival, she  exhibited her treasure to him with a great deal of pride, asking if he  did not envy her papa.    \"Yes,\" he said, looking admiringly at her, and then turning away with  a half sigh.    A few minutes afterwards he caught hold of her, set her on his knee,  and giving her a kiss, said, \"I wish you were ten years older, Elsie,  or I ten years younger.\"    \"Why, Mr. Travilla?\" she asked rather wonderingly.    \"Oh, because we would then be nearer of an age, and maybe you would  like me better.\"    \"No, I wouldn't, not a bit,\" she said, putting her arm round his neck,  \"for I like you now just as well as I could like any gentleman but  papa.\"    The elder Mr. Dinsmore was very proud of his little grandson and made  a great pet of him, coming to the Oaks much more frequently after his  birth than before.    Once he spoke of him as his first grandchild.    \"You forget Elsie, father,\" said Horace, putting his arm round his  little girl, who happened to be standing by his side, and giving her a  tender, loving look.    He greatly feared that the marked difference his father made between  the two would wound Elsie's sensitive spirit, and perhaps even arouse  a feeling of jealousy towards her little brother; therefore, when his  father was present, he was even more than usually affectionate in his  manner towards her, if that were possible.    But Elsie had no feeling of the kind; she had long ceased to expect  any manifestation of affection from her grandfather towards herself,  but was very glad indeed that he could love her dear little brother.    \"Ah, yes! to be sure, I did forget Elsie,\" replied the old gentleman  carelessly; \"she is the first grandchild of course; but this fellow is  the first grandson, and quite proud of him I am. He is a pretty boy,  and is going to be the very image of his father.\"    \"I hope he will, father,\" said Rose, looking proudly at her husband.  And then she added, with an affectionate glance at Elsie: \"If he is  only as good and obedient as his sister, I shall be quite satisfied  with him. We could not ask a better child than our dear little  daughter, nor love one more than we do her; she is a great comfort and  blessing to us both.\"    The color mounted to Elsie's cheek, and her eyes beamed with pleasure.  Mr. Dinsmore, too, looked very much gratified, and the old gentleman  could not fail to perceive that the difference he made between the  children was quite distasteful to both parents.          CHAPTER V.      A lovely "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#7)"],[1,"home of Pericles, besides bread  and cheese for Melas and the children. The Twins were so excited they  would have danced along the road instead of walking if it hadn't been  for the basket, but every time Daphne got too lively, Dion said,  \"Remember the eggs,\" and every time Dion forgot and skipped, Daphne said  the same thing to him.    They had gone nearly a mile in this way, when the road took them to the  crest of a hill, from the top of which it seemed as if they could see the  whole world. Just below them lay the little seaport town of Ambelaca, and  beyond it the blue waters of the bay sparkled and danced in the morning  breeze. On the farther side of the bay they could see the white buildings  of the Piraeus, and beyond that in the distance was a chain of blue  mountains over which the sun was just peeping. That sight was so  beautiful that the children set down their basket, and Melas too stood  still to gaze.    \"Those blue mountains beyond the Piraeus are the hills of Athens,\" said  Melas. \"The one with the flat top is the sacred hill of the Acropolis.  And right down there,\" he added, pointing to a white house on a near-by  hill-top, overlooking the sea, \"is the house of Euripides, the Poet. He  has come from the noise and confusion of the city to find a quiet refuge  upon Salamis.\"    \"Does he write real poetry?\" asked Daphne.    \"They say he does,\" answered Melas, \"though I never read any of it  myself.\"    \"I wish I could write,\" sighed Daphne, \"even if it wasn't poetry! Even if  it were only curses to hang around a scarecrow's neck. I'd like to  write!\"    \"Girls don't need to know how to write,\" said Melas. \"It doesn't make  them any better housekeepers. I don't even see how Dion is going to  learn. There are no schools in Salamis.\"    \"Oh dear!\" thought Daphne, \"there it is again.\" But she said nothing and  followed Melas down the hill and into the village street.    Soon they found themselves at the dock where the boat was tied. There  were already passengers on board when the Twins and their Father arrived.  There were two farmers with baskets of eggs and vegetables, and there was  an old woman with a large bundle of bread. Next to her sat a fisherman  with a basket of eels. They were all going to the market in the Piraeus  to sell their produce. Melas with the lamb in his arms climbed in beside  one of the farmers and sat facing the fisherman. Dion sat next to him  with the basket on his knee, and Daphne had to sit beside the fisherman  and the eels. The eels squirmed frightfully, and Daphne squirmed too  every time she looked at them. She was afraid one might get out and wrap  itself around her legs. They did look so horribly like snakes, and Daphne  felt about snakes just as most girls do. However, she knew it was useless  to say anything. There was no other seat for her, and so she remembered  that she was a Spartan and tried not to look at them.    When they were all seated, the rowers took their places on the  rowing-benches, the captain gave the signal, and off they went over the  blue waters toward the distant shore. For a time everything went  smoothly. There was no sound but the rattling of the oarlocks, the chant  of the rowers as they dipped their oars, and the rippling of the water  against the sides of the boat. Up to this time the black lamb had lain  quietly in Melas' arms, but now something seemed to disturb him. He  lifted his head, gave a sudden bleat, and somehow flung himself out of  Melas' arms directly into the basket of eels! Such a squirming as there  was then! The eels squirmed, and the lamb squirmed, and if his legs had  not been securely tied together he undoubtedly would have flopped right  into the water, and then this story would never have been written.    The fisherman gave an angry roar. \"Keep your miserable lamb out of my eel  basket,\" he shouted.    Melas had not waited to be told. He had already seized the lamb, but it  struggled hard to get away, and between the lamb and the eels there was a  disturbance that threatened to upset the boat.    \"Sit still,\" roared the captain. \"Have you no sense? Do you all want to  go to the bottom?\"    \"May Poseidon defend us!\" cried the old woman with the bread. \"I've no  wish to be made into eel-bait.\"    \"Nor I,\" said one of the farmers angrily. \"You'd better kill your lambs  before you take them to market,\" he said to Melas; \"it will be safer for  the rest of us.\"    \"The lamb is not for market,\" Melas answered. \"I would not dare kill it.  It bears a portent on its brow!\"    \"A portent?\" gasped the old woman.    \"May all the Gods defend us! What portent?\" Melas pointed to the horn.  \"It has but one horn,\" he said.    They all became still at once. They all looked at the lamb. They all felt  of his horn. Their eyes grew big.    \"There was never such a thing known,\" said the farmer.    \"Whose is the lamb?\" asked another. \"Is it yours?\"    \"No,\" said Melas, \"it belongs to Pericles the Archon. It was born on his  farm. I am taking it to him so that he may decide what to do with it.\"    \"A portent on the farm of Pericles?\" cried the old woman. \"I'll warrant  it will be read as favoring him, since he already has a world at his  feet. May the Gods forgive me, but it seems to me they are often more  partial than just.\"    \"Hush, woman,\" said one of the farmers. \"Speak no ill of the Gods, not  until we are safe on the land at any rate.\"    The woman snapped her mouth shut. The farmers and the fisherman settled  themselves as far away as possible from the Twins and Melas, and nothing  more was said until the boat touched the other shore, and all the  passengers scrambled out upon the dock. The farmers and the fisherman and  the old woman all hastened away to the marketplace, and when they reached  it, they must have kept their tongues busy, for as Melas and the Twins  passed through it on their way to Athens a few moments later, they were  followed by a crowd of curious people who wanted to see the lamb and who  had a great deal to say about what such a miracle might mean.    Melas paid little attention to them, but hastened on his way, and soon  they reached the eastern edge of the town and started along the paved  road which ran from the Piraeus to Athens proper. This road was nearly  five miles long and ran between two high walls of stone some distance  apart. The curious crowd left them at this point and the three walked on  alone through olive orchards and past little vineyards, toward Athens.    \"Nobody could get lost on this road,\" said Dion to his Father, \"not even  if he tried! He couldn't get over the walls.\"    \"What are the walls for?\" asked Daphne. \"It seems silly to build high  walls like this right out in the country.\"    \"Not so silly when you think about it,\" answered Melas. \"These walls were  built by Pericles, so that if any enemy should make an invasion, Athens  would always have a safe access to the sea. Without that she could be  starved within her own walls in a very short time.\"    \"Pericles must be almost as powerful and wise as the Gods themselves, I  should think,\" said Daphne.    \"He does all these things by the help of the Gods, without doubt,\" said  Melas.    When they were halfway on their journey to the city, Dion suddenly let  down his side of the basket with a thump.    \"Remember the eggs!\" cried Daphne sharply, but Dion did not seem to hear.    \"Look! Look!\" he cried and pointed toward the east. There against the  sky, on the top of the sacred mountain, stood a gigantic figure shining  in the sun.    \"What is it?\" cried both children at once.    \"That is the bronze statue of Athena, the Goddess who gives protection to  Athens,\" said Melas.    \"Did Pericles make that too?\" asked Daphne.    Melas laughed. \"No,\" he said; \"you must not think Pericles made  everything you may see in Athens. Great as he is, he is not a sculptor.\"    \"Oh, oh,\" cried Dion, \"I want to see the Gorgon's head with snaky locks.  Don't you remember the Stranger said it was on the breastplate of the  statue?\"    \"Ugh,\" said Daphne, shuddering. \"I don't believe I'd like it. It must  look just like eels.\"    \"Come, come,\" said Melas. \"At this rate you won't have a chance. The day  will be gone before we know it.\"    The Twins picked up the basket, and the three marched on toward the city,  and it was not long before they had entered the gate and were passing  along closely built-up streets to the home of the greatest man in Athens.    \"This is the place,\" said Melas at last, stopping at one of the houses.    \"This isn't Pericles' house, is it?\" cried Daphne. \"Why, I thought it  would be the biggest house in Athens, and it looks just like the others.\"    \"Pericles does not put on much style,\" said Melas, as he lifted the  knocker on the door. \"He is too great to need display. He cares more  about fine public buildings for the city than about making his neighbors  envious by living better than they do. Just get the idea out of your head  that greatness means wealth and luxury, or you are no true Spartans, nor  even good Athenians.\"    As he said this, Melas let the knocker fall. The door was immediately  opened by a porter, who looked surprised when he saw Melas and the Twins.    \"What brings you in from the farm?\" he said.    \"I wish to see your mistress, the wife of Pericles,\" said Melas, with  dignity. \"I have business of importance.\"    \"Come in, come in,\" said the porter, grinning good-naturedly; \"and you,  too, little boys,\" he added graciously to the Twins, and led the way into  the house. Dion was just opening his mouth to explain that Daphne wasn't  a boy, but Daphne poked him in the ribs and shook her head at him. \"Let  him think so,\" she said, jerking her chiton up shorter through her  girdle.    They were ushered through a passageway into the court of the house, and  there the porter left them while he went to call his mistress. The house,  though little different from the other houses of well-to-do Athenians,  "]]]
