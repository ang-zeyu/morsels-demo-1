The smallest bees can squeeze through the  passage without paying toll. To those of the Andrena and Halictus tribe  the flower is evidently best adapted. Sometimes the largest bumblebees,  either unable or unwilling to get out by the legitimate route, bite  their way to liberty. Mutilated sacs are not uncommon. But when unable  to get out by fair means, and too bewildered to escape by foul, the  large bee must sometimes perish miserably in his gorgeous prison.      Showy, Gay, or Spring Orchis    _Orchis spectabilis_    _Flowers_--Purplish pink, of deeper and lighter shade, the lower lip  white, and thick of texture; from 3 to 6 on a spike; fragrant. Sepals  pointed, united, arching above the converging petals, and resembling a  hood; lip large, spreading, prolonged into a spur, which is largest at  the tip and as long as the twisted footstem. _Stem:_ 4 to 12 in. high,  thick, fleshy, 5-sided. _Leaves:_ 2, large, broadly ovate, glossy green,  silvery on underside, rising from a few scales from root. _Fruit:_ A  sharply angled capsule, 1 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods, especially under hemlocks.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--From New Brunswick and Ontario southward to our Southern  states, westward to Nebraska.    Of the six floral leaves which every orchid, terrestrial or aerial,  possesses, one is always peculiar in form, pouch-shaped, or a cornucopia  filled with nectar, or a flaunted, fringed banner, or a broad platform  for the insect visitors to alight on. Some orchids look to imaginative  eyes as if they were masquerading in the disguise of bees, moths, frogs,  birds, butterflies. A number of these queer freaks are to be found in  Europe. Spring traps, adhesive plasters, and hair-triggers attached to  explosive shells of pollen are among the many devices by which orchids  compel insects to cross-fertilize them, these flowers as a family  showing the most marvellous mechanism adapted to their requirements from  insects in the whole floral kingdom. No other blossoms can so well  afford to wear magenta, the ugliest shade nature produces, the \"lovely  rosy purple\" of Dutch bulb growers.      Large, or Early, Purple-fringed Orchis    _Habenaria fimbriata (H. grandiflora)_    _Flowers_--Pink-purple and pale lilac, sometimes nearly white; fragrant,  alternate, clustered in thick, dense spikes from 3 to 15 in. long. Upper  sepal and toothed petals erect; the lip of deepest shade, 1/2 in. long,  fan-shaped, 3-parted, fringed half its length, and prolonged at base  into slender, long spur; stamen united with style into short column; 2  anther sacs slightly divergent, the hollow between them glutinous,  stigmatic. _Stem:_ 1 to 5 ft. high, angled, twisted. _Leaves:_ Oval,  large, sheathing the stem below; smaller, lance-shaped ones higher up  bracts above. _Root:_ Thick, fibrous.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist meadows, muddy places, woods.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Ontario; southward to North Carolina,  westward to Michigan.    Because of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of orchids  as a family to their insect visitors, no group of plants has greater  interest for the botanist since Darwin interpreted their marvellous  mechanism, and Gray, his instant disciple, revealed the hidden purposes  of our native American species, no less wonderfully constructed than the  most costly exotic in a millionaire's hothouse.    A glance at the spur of this orchid, one of the handsomest and most  striking of its clan, and the heavy perfume of the flower, would seem to  indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis could reach the nectar  secreted at the base of the thread-like passage. Butterflies, attracted  by the conspicuous color, sometimes hover about the showy spikes of  bloom, but it is probable that, to secure a sip, all but possibly the  very largest of them must go to the smaller Purple-fringed Orchis, whose  shorter spur holds out a certain prospect of reward; for, in these two  cases, as in so many others, the flower's welcome for an insect is in  exact proportion to the length of its visitor's tongue. Doubtless it is  one of the smaller sphinx moths, such as we see at dusk working about  the evening primrose and other flowers deep of chalice, and heavily  perfumed to guide visitors to their feast, that is the great  Purple-fringed Orchid's benefactor, since the length of its tongue is  perfectly adapted to its needs. Attracted by the showy, broad lower  petal, his wings ever in rapid motion, the moth proceeds to unroll his  proboscis and drain the cup that is frequently an inch and a half deep.  Thrusting in his head, either one or both of his large, projecting eyes  are pressed against the sticky button-shaped discs to which the pollen  masses are attached by a stalk, and as he raises his head to depart,  feeling that he is caught, he gives a little jerk that detaches them,  and away he flies with these still fastened to his eyes.    Even while he is flying to another flower, that is to say, in half a  minute, the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from the  perpendicular and slightly toward the centre, or just far enough to  require the moth, in thrusting his proboscis into the nectary, to strike  the glutinous, sticky stigma. Now, withdrawing his head, either or both  of the golden clubs he brought in with him will be left on the precise  spot where they will fertilize the flower. Sometimes, but rarely, we  catch a butterfly or moth from the smaller or larger purple orchids with  a pollen mass attached to his tongue, instead of to his eyes; this is  when he does not make his entrance from the exact centre--as in these  flowers he is not obliged to do--and in order to reach the nectary his  tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky anther sacs. The  performance may be successfully imitated by thrusting some blunt point  about the size of a moth's head, a dull pencil or a knitting-needle,  into the flower as an insect would enter. Withdraw the pencil, and one  or both of the pollen masses will be found sticking to it, and already  automatically changing their attitude. In the case of the large,  round-leaved orchis, whose greenish-white flowers are fertilized in a  similar manner by the sphinx moth, the anther sacs converge, like little  horns; and their change of attitude while they are being carried to  fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact.      White-fringed Orchis    _Habenaria blephariglottis_    _Flowers_--Pure white, fragrant, borne on a spike from 3 to 6 in. long.  Spur long, slender; oval sepals; smaller petal toothed; the oblong lip  deeply fringed. _Stem:_ Slender, 1 to 2 ft. high. _Leaves:_  Lance-shaped, parallel-veined, clasping the stem; upper ones smallest.    _Preferred Habitat_--Peat-bogs and swamps.    _Flowering Season_--July-August.    _Distribution_--Northeastern United States and eastern Canada to  Newfoundland.    One who selfishly imagines that all the floral beauty of the earth was  created for man's sole delight will wonder why a flower so exquisitely  beautiful as this dainty little orchid should be hidden in inaccessible  peat-bogs, where overshoes and tempers get lost with deplorable  frequency, and the water-snake and bittern mock at man's intrusion of  their realm by the ease with which they move away from him. Not for man,  but for the bee, the moth, and the butterfly, are orchids where they are  and what they are.      Yellow-fringed Orchis    _Habenaria ciliaris_    _Flowers_--Bright yellow or orange, borne in a showy, closely set,  oblong spike, 3 to 6 in. long. The lip of each flower copiously fringed;  the slender spur 1 to 1-1/2 in. long; similar to White-fringed Orchis  (see above); and between the two, intermediate pale yellow hybrids may  be found. _Stem:_ Slender, leafy, 1 to 2-1/2 feet high. _Leaves:_  Lance-shaped, clasping.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist meadows and sandy bogs.    _Flowering Season-_--July-August.    _Distribution_--Vermont to Florida; Ontario to Texas.    Where this brilliant, beautiful orchid and its lovely white sister grow  together in the bog--which cannot be through a very wide range, since  one is common northward, where the other is rare, and _vice versa_--the  Yellow-fringed Orchis will be found blooming a few days later. In  general structure the plants closely resemble each other.    From Ontario and the Mississippi eastward, and southward to the Gulf,  the Tubercled or Small Pale Green Orchis _(H. flava)_ lifts a spire of  inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, more attractive to the eye of the  structural botanist than to the aesthete. It blooms in moist places, as  most orchids do, since water with which to manufacture nectar enough to  fill their deep spurs is a prime necessity. Orchids have arrived at that  pinnacle of achievement that it is impossible for them to fertilize  themselves. More than that, some are absolutely sterile to their own  pollen when it is applied to their stigmas artificially! With insect  aid, however, a single plant has produced more than 1,000,700 seeds. No  wonder, then, that as a family, they have adopted the most marvellous  blandishments and mechanism in the whole floral kingdom to secure the  visits of that special insect to which each is adapted, and, having  secured him, to compel him unwittingly to do their bidding. In the  steaming tropical jungles, where vegetation is luxuriant to the point of  suffocation, and where insect life swarms in myriads undreamed of here,  we can see the best of reasons for orchids mounting into trees and  living on air to escape strangulation on the ground, and for donning  larger and more gorgeous apparel to attract attention in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"produce the most striking phenomena. To these we must  ascribe the effects of thunder, the eruption of volcanoes, earthquakes,  &c. Science offers to our consideration an agent of astonishing force,  in gunpowder, the instant it comes in contact with fire. In short, the  most terrible effects result from the combination of matter, which is  generally believed to be dead and inert.    These facts prove, beyond a doubt, that motion is produced, is  augmented, is accelerated in matter, without the help of any exterior  agent: therefore it is reasonable to conclude that motion is the  necessary consequence of immutable laws, resulting from the essence,  from the properties existing in the different elements, and the  various combinations of these elements. Are we not justified, then,  in concluding, from these precedents, that there may be an infinity of  other combinations, with which we are unacquainted, competent to produce  a great variety of motion in matter, without being under the necessity  of having recourse, for the explanation, to agents who are more  difficult to comprehend than even the effects which are attributed to  them?    Had man but paid proper attention to what passed under his review, he  would not have sought out of Nature, a power distinguished from herself,  to set her in action, and without which he believes she cannot move. If,  indeed, by Nature is meant a heap of dead matter, destitute of peculiar  qualities purely passive, we must unquestionably seek out of this Nature  the principle of her motion. But if by Nature be understood, what it  really is, a whole, of which the numerous parts are endowed with various  properties, which oblige them to act according to these properties;  which are in a perpetual ternateness of action and reaction; which  press, which gravitate towards a common center, whilst others depart  from and fly off towards the periphery, or circumference; which attract  and repel; which by continual approximation and constant collision,  produce and decompose all the bodies we behold; then, I say, there is  no necessity to have recourse to supernatural powers, to account for the  formation of things, and those extraordinary appearances which are the  result of motion.    Those who admit a cause exterior to matter, are obliged to believe that  this cause produced all the motion by which matter is agitated in giving  it existence. This belief rests on another, namely, that matter could  begin to exist; an hypothesis that, until this moment, has never been  satisfactorily demonstrated. To produce from nothing, or the CREATION,  is a term that cannot give us the least idea of the formation of the  universe; it presents no sense, upon which the mind can rely. In fact,  the human mind is not adequate to conceive a moment of non-existence, or  when all shall have passed away; even admitting this to be a truth, it  is no truth for us, because by the very nature of our organization, we  cannot admit positions as facts, of which no evidence can be adduced  that has relation to our senses; we may, indeed, consent to believe it,  because others say it; but will any rational being be satisfied with  such an admission? Can any moral good spring from such blind assurance?  Is it consistent with sound doctrine, with philosophy, or with reason?  Do we, in fact, pay any respect to the intellectual powers of another,  when we say to him, \"I will believe this, because in all the attempts  you have ventured, for the purpose of proving what you say, you have  entirely failed; and have been at last obliged to acknowledge you know  nothing about the matter?\" What moral reliance ought we to have on such  people? Hypothesis may succeed hypothesis; system may destroy system: a  new set of ideas may overturn the ideas of a former day. Other  Gallileos may be condemned to death--other Newtons may arise--we may  reason--argue--dispute--quarrel--punish and destroy: nay, we may even  exterminate those who differ from us in opinion; but when we have  done all this, we shall be obliged to fall back upon our original  darkness--to confess, that that which has no relation with our senses,  that which cannot manifest itself to us by some of the ordinary modes  by which other things are manifested, has no existence for us--is not  comprehensible by us--can never entirely remove our doubt--can never  seize on our stedfast belief; seeing it is that of which we cannot form  even a notion; in short, that it is that, which as long as we remain  what we are, must be hidden from us by a veil, which no power, no  faculty, no energy we possess, is able to remove. All who are not  enslaved by prejudice agree to the truth of the position, that _nothing  can be made of nothing_. Many theologians have acknowledged Nature to  be an active whole. Almost all the ancient philosophers were agreed to  regard the world as eternal. OCELLUS LUCANUS, speaking of the universe,  says, \"_it has always been, and it always will be_.\" VATABLE and GROTIUS  assure us, that to render the Hebrew phrase in the first chapter of  GENESIS correctly, we must say, \"_when God made heaven and earth, matter  was without form._\" If this be true, and every Hebraist can judge for  himself, then the word which has been rendered _created_, means only  to fashion, form, arrange. We know that the Greek words _create_ and  _form_, have always indicated the same thing. According to ST. JEROME,  _creare_ has the same meaning as _condere_, to found, to build. The  Bible does not anywhere say in a clear manner, that the world was made  of nothing. TERTULLIAN and the father PETAU both admit, that \"_this is  a truth established more by reason than by authority._\" ST. JUSTIN seems  to have contemplated matter as eternal, since he commends PLATO for  having said, that \"_God, in the creation of the world, only gave impulse  to matter, and fashioned it._\" BURNET and PYTHAGORAS were entirely of  this opinion, and even our Church Service may be adduced in support; for  although it admits by implication a beginning, it expressly denies an  end: \"_As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world  without end._\" It is easy to perceive that that which cannot cease to  exist, must have always been.    Motion becomes still more obscure, when creation, or the formation of  matter, is attributed to a SPIRITUAL being; that is to say, to a being  which has no analogy, no point of contact, with it--to a being which  has neither extent or parts, and cannot, therefore, be susceptible of  motion, as we understand the term; this being only the change of one  body, relatively to another body, in which the body moved presents  successively different parts to different points of space. Moreover,  as all the world are nearly agreed that matter can never be totally  annihilated, or cease to exist; by what reasoning, I would ask, do they  comprehend--how understand--that that which cannot cease to be, could  ever have had a beginning?    If, therefore, it be asked, whence came matter? it is very reasonable to  say it has always existed. If it be inquired, whence proceeds the motion  that agitates matter? the same reasoning furnishes the answer; namely,  that as motion is coeval with matter, it must have existed from all  eternity, seeing that motion is the necessary consequence of its  existence--of its essence--of its primitive properties, such as its  extent, its gravity, its impenetrability, its figure, &c. By virtue  of these essential constituent properties, inherent in all matter, and  without which it is impossible to form an idea of it, the various matter  of which the universe is composed must from all eternity have  pressed against, each other--have gravitated towards a center--have  clashed--have come in contact--have been attracted--have been  repelled--have been combined--have been separated: in short, must have  acted and moved according to the essence and energy peculiar to each  genus, and to each of its combinations.    Existence supposes properties in the thing that exists: whenever it  has properties, its mode of action must necessarily flow from those  properties which constitute, its mode of being. Thus, when a body is  ponderous, it must fall; when it falls, it must come in collision with  the bodies it meets in its descent; when it is dense, when it is solid,  it must, by reason of this density, communicate motion to the bodies  with which it clashes; when it has analogy, when it has affinity with  these bodies, it must be attracted, must be united with them; when it  has no point of analogy with them, it must be repulsed.    From which it may be fairly inferred, that in supposing, as we are under  the necessity of doing, the existence of matter, we must suppose it to  have some kind of properties; from which its motion, or modes of action,  must necessarily flow. To form the universe, DESCARTES asked but matter  and motion: a diversity of matter sufficed for him; variety of motion  was the consequence of its existence, of its essence, of its properties:  its different modes of action would be the necessary consequence of  its different modes of being. Matter without properties would be a mere  nothing; therefore, as soon as matter exists, it must act; as soon as  it is various, it must act variously; if it cannot commence to exist,  it must have existed from all eternity; if it has always existed, it can  never cease to be: if it can never cease to be, it can never cease to  act by its own energy. Motion is a manner of being, which matter derives  from its peculiar existence.    The existence, then, of matter is a fact: the existence of motion is  another fact. Our visual organs point out to us matter with different  essences, forming a variety of combinations, endowed with various  properties that discriminate them. Indeed, it is a palpable error to  believe that matter is a homogeneous body, of which the parts differ  from each other only by"]]]
