Details of the  engagement are wanting, but the Pyramid Texts state that the body of  Osiris was hurled to the ground by Set at a place called Netat, which  seems to have been near Abydos.[FN#26]  The news of the death of Osiris  was brought to Isis, and she at once set out to find his body.  All  legends agree in saying that she took the form of a bird, and that she  flew about unceasingly, going hither and thither, and uttering wailing  cries of grief.  At length she found the body, and with a piercing cry  she alighted on the ground.  The Pyramid Texts say that Nephthys was  with her that \"Isis came, Nephthys came, the one on the right side, the  other on the left side, one in the form of a Hat bird, the other in the  form of a Tchert bird, and they found Osiris thrown on the ground in  Netat by his brother Set.\"  The late form of the legend goes on to say  that Isis fanned the body with her feathers, and produced air, and that  at length she caused the inert members of Osiris to move, and drew from  him his essence, wherefrom she produced her child Horus.        [FN#26]  Pepi I., line 475; Pepi II., line 1263.        This bare statement of the dogma of the conception of Horus does not  represent all that is known about it, and it may well be supplemented  by a passage from the Pyramid Texts,[FN#27] which reads, \"Adoration to  thee, O Osiris.[FN#28]  Rise thou up on thy left side, place thyself on  thy right side.  This water which I give unto thee is the water of  youth (or rejuvenation).  Adoration to thee, O Osiris!  Rise thou up on  thy left side, place thyself on thy right side.  This bread which I  have made for thee is warmth.  Adoration to thee, O Osiris!  The doors  of heaven are opened to thee, the doors of the streams are thrown wide  open to thee.  The gods in the city of Pe come [to thee], Osiris, at  the sound (or voice) of the supplication of Isis and Nephthys. . . . .  Thy elder sister took thy body in her arms, she chafed thy hands,  she clasped thee to her breast [when] she found thee [lying] on thy  side on the plain of Netat.\"  And in another place we read:[FN#29] \"Thy  two sisters, Isis and Nephthys, came to thee, Kam-urt, in thy name of  Kam-ur, Uatchet-urt, in thy name of Uatch-ur . . . . . . . Isis and  Nephthys weave magical protection for thee in the city of Saut, for  thee their lord, in thy name of 'Lord of Saut,' for their god, in thy  name of 'God.'  They praise thee; go not thou far from them in thy name  of 'Tua.'  They present offerings to thee; be not wroth in thy name of  'Tchentru.'  Thy sister Isis cometh to thee rejoicing in her love for  thee.[FN#30]  Thou hast union with her, thy seed entereth her.  She  conceiveth in the form of the star Septet (Sothis).  Horus-Sept issueth  from thee in the form of Horus, dweller in the star Septet.  Thou  makest a spirit to be in him in his name 'Spirit dwelling in the god  Tchentru.'  He avengeth thee in his name of 'Horus, the son who avenged  his father.'  Hail, Osiris, Keb hath brought to thee Horus, he hath  avenged thee, he hath brought to thee the hearts of the gods, Horus  hath given thee his Eye, thou hast taken possession of the Urert Crown  thereby at the head of the gods.  Horus hath presented to thee thy  members, he hath collected them completely, there is no disorder in  thee.  Thoth hath seized thy enemy and hath slain him and those who  were with him.\"  The above words are addressed to dead kings in the  Pyramid Texts, and what the gods were supposed to do for them was  believed by the Egyptians to have been actually done for Osiris.  These  extracts are peculiarly valuable, for they prove that the legend of  Osiris which was current under the XVIIIth Dynasty was based upon  traditions which were universally accepted in Egypt under the Vth and  VIth Dynasties.

His succession also received the approval of Neb-er-  tcher, who, as we saw from the first legend in this book, was the  Creator of the Universe.            VI.        A LEGEND OF KHENSU NEFER-HETEP[FN#31] AND THE PRINCESS OF BEKHTEN.        [FN#31]    In the headlines of this section, p. 106 ff., for Ptah  Nefer-hetep read Khensu Nefer-hetep.        The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics upon a sandstone stele,  with a rounded top, which was found in the temple of Khensu at Thebes,  and is now preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris; it was  discovered by Champollion, and removed to Paris by Prisse d'Avennes in  1846.  The text was first published by Prisse d'Avennes,[FN#32] and it  was first translated by Birch[FN#33] in 1853.  The text was republished  and translated into French by E. de Rouge in 1858,[FN#34] and several  other renderings have been given in German and in English since that  date.[FN#35]  When the text was first published, and for some years  afterwards, it was generally thought that the legend referred to events  which were said to have taken place under a king who was identified as  Rameses XIII., but this misconception was corrected by Erman, who  showed[FN#36] that the king was in reality Rameses II.  By a careful  examination of the construction of the text he proved that the  narrative on the stele was drawn up several hundreds of years after the  events described in it took place, and that its author was but  imperfectly acquainted with the form of the Egyptian language in use in  the reign of Rameses II.  In fact, the legend was written in the  interests of the priests of the temple of Khensu, who wished to magnify  their god and his power to cast out devils and to exorcise evil  spirits; it was probably composed between B.C. 650 and B.C. 250.[FN#37]        [FN#32]  Choix de Monuments Egyptiens, Paris, 1847, plate xxiv.

The legend, after enumerating the great names of Rameses II., goes on  to state that the king was in the \"country of the two rivers,\" by which  we are to understand some portion of Mesopotamia, the rivers being the  Tigris and Euphrates, and that the local chiefs were bringing to him  tribute consisting of gold, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, and logs of wood  from the Land of the God.  It is difficult to understand how gold and  logs of wood from Southern Arabia and East Africa came to be produced  as tribute by chiefs who lived so far to the north.  Among those who  sent gifts was the Prince of Bekhten, and at the head of all his  tribute he sent his eldest daughter, bearing his message of homage and  duty.  Now the maiden was beautiful, and the King of Egypt thought her  so lovely that be took her to wife, and bestowed upon her the name \"Ra-  neferu,\" which means something like the \"beauties of Ra.\"  He took her  back with him to Egypt, where she was installed as Queen.    During the summer of the fifteenth year of his reign, whilst Rameses  II. was celebrating a festival of Amen-Ra in the Temple of Luxor, one  came to him and reported that an envoy had arrived from the Prince of  Bekhten, bearing with him many gifts for the Royal Wife Ra-neferu.  When the envoy had been brought into the presence, he addressed words  of homage to the king, and, having presented the gifts from his lord,  he said that he had come to beg His Majesty to send a \"learned man,\"  i.e., a magician, to Bekhten to attend Bent-enth-resh, His Majesty's  sister-in-law, who was stricken with some disease.  Thereupon the king  summoned the learned men of the House of Life, i.e., the members of the  great College of Magic at Thebes, and the qenbetu officials, and when  they had entered his presence, he commanded them to select a man of  \"wise heart and deft fingers\" to go to Bekhten.  The choice fell upon  one Tehuti-em-heb, and His Majesty sent him to Bekhten with the envoy.  When they arrived in Bekhten, Tehuti-em-heb found that the Princess  Bent-enth-resh was possessed by an evil spirit which refused to be  exorcised by him, and he was unable to cast out the devil.  The Prince  of Bekhten, seeing that the healing of his daughter was beyond the  power of the Egyptian, sent a second envoy to Rameses II., and besought  him to send a god to drive out the devil.  This envoy arrived in Egypt  in the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Rameses II., and  found the king celebrating a festival in Thebes.  When he heard the  petition of the envoy, he went to the Temple of Khensu Nefer-hetep \"a  second time,\"[FN#38] and presented himself before the god and besought  his help on behalf of his sister-in-law.        [FN#38]  Thus the king must have invoked the help of Khensu on the  occasion of the visit of the first envoy.        Then the priests of Khensu Nefer-hetep carried the statue of this god  to the place where was the statue of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#7)"],[1," Pasha,  however, who was at Mekka when she touched at Djidda, in direct  violation of his engagements, stopped the ship, prohibited her  proceeding to Suez, compelled the captain to sell the cargo at a loss,  while the plague was raging in the town, and exacted the same duties as  are taken on country ships, in contravention of the stipulations  existing between Great Britain and the Porte. This affair, which created  great disgust amongst the Europeans in Egypt, might easily have been  remedied by retaliation upon the Pashas ships trading to Malta, which  would have taught him to respect the British flag wherever he might meet  it. The British officers, however, from an erroneous conception perhaps  of his power and    [p.21] importance, and from a wish to remain upon a friendly footing  with him, instead of evincing any displeasure, preferred submitting  silently to the outrage; forgetting that the favour of a Turkish ruler  can never be bought by conciliation, but can only be obtained by an  attitude of defiance. In consequence of all this, the merchants were  obliged to make a second treaty with the Pasha, which was formally  ratified. His first demand was, that the ships should pay at Suez the  joint customs of that port and Djidda, which would have been equivalent  to about 12 per cent.; but he contented himself, at last, with a promise  of 9 per cent. upon all imports into Suez from India, which was six per  cent. more than the usual duty paid by European merchants in the ports  of the Grand Signior. This arrangement, it is supposed, will lead to the  opening of an active trade. The Pasha himself is disposed to speculate  on his own account; and the first adventure he sent to Bombay, in the  spring of 1816, was to bring him, in return, a richly caparisoned  elephant, destined as a present to his sovereign at Constantinople.  Still, however, I am afraid he will as little respect the second treaty  as he did the first; for his avarice, if not effectually checked, knows  no bounds, and he can at any time exact additional imposts, as far as  the profits of this new commercial route can bear them, by threatening  the security of the road from Suez to Cairo, the Bedouins of the  neighbouring Desert being completely at his command.    The former master of Djidda, Sherif Ghaleb, was actively engaged in the  Indian trade; he had two ships, of four hundred tons each, employed in  it, besides many smaller vessels in the coffee trade to Yemen; indeed,  he was a shrewd speculator in all branches of the Red Sea trade. He  oppressed the merchants of Djidda by heavy duties and his own powerful  competition; but he was never known to practise extortion upon them. If  he borrowed money, he repaid it at the stipulated time, and never  ventured to levy extraordinary contributions from individuals, although  he did [p.22] it from the whole community, by increasing the duties in  an arbitrary manner. It was the well-known security which property  enjoyed under his government that induced foreign merchants to visit the  port of Djidda, even when Ghaleb was reduced to great distress by the  Wahabis. His conduct, however, in this respect, was not caused by any  love of justice, for he governed most despotically; but he well knew  that, if the merchants should be frightened away, his town would sink  into insignificance. Towards the close of his government, the duty upon  coffee was increased by him from two and a half to five dollars per  quintal, or to about fifteen per cent. The duty upon India goods was  from six to ten per cent., according to their quality. If Ghaleb could  not immediately sell the coffee or India goods imported on his account,  he distributed the cargoes of his ships among the native merchants of  the place at the current market-price, in quantities proportioned to the  supposed property of each merchant, who was thus forced to become a  purchaser for ready money. In this respect Ghaleb was not singular; for  in Egypt the present Pasha frequently distributes his coffee among the  merchants; with this difference, however, from the practice of Ghaleb,  that the price which he exacts is always above the real market-price.    Business in Djidda is conducted through the intervention of brokers, who  are for the most part Indians of small property and bad reputations.    The number of ships belonging to Djidda is very great. Taking into  account all the small vessels employed in the Red Sea trade, two hundred  and fifty perhaps may be calculated as belonging either to merchants of  the town, or to owners, who navigate them, and who consider the port as  their principal home. The different names given to these ships, as Say,  Seume, Merkeb, Sambouk, Dow, denote their size; the latter only, being  the largest, perform the voyage to India. The ships are navigated  chiefly by people from Yemen, from the Somawly coast (opposite to Aden,    [p.23] between Abyssinia and Cape Guardafui,) and by slaves, of which  latter three or four are generally found in every ship. The crew receive  a certain sum for the voyage, and every sailor is, at the same time, a  petty trader on his own account; this is another cause of the resort of  foreigners to Djidda during the trade winds, for persons with the  smallest capitals can purchase goods in retail, at the first hand, from  the crews of these ships. No vessels of any kind are now constructed at  Djidda, so scarce has timber become; indeed, it is with difficulty that  means are found to repair a ship. Yembo is subject to the same  inconvenience. Suez, Hadeyda, and Mokha, are the only harbours in the  Red Sea where ships are built. The timber used at Suez is transported  thither overland from Cairo, and comes originally from the coast of Asia  Minor: The canvas used all over the Red Sea is of Egyptian manufacture.  The cordage is of the date-tree. Ships coming from the East Indies have  cordage made of the cocoa-nut tree, of which a quantity is also brought  for sale. That employed at Hadeyda and Mokha comes partly from Yemen,  and partly from the African coast. Many ships are purchased at Bombay  and Maskat; but those built at Suez are most common in the sea north of  Yemen. There has been a great want of shipping at Djidda during the last  three years, as the Pasha had seized a great number of ships, and  obliged their owners to transport provisions, ammunition, and baggage,  from Egypt to the Hedjaz, for which he pays a very low freight. During  my stay at Djidda, scarcely a day passed without some arrival by sea,  chiefly from Yembo and Cosseir; and there were constantly forty or fifty  ships in the harbour. An officer, entitled Emir al Bahhr, acts as  harbour-master, and takes from each ship a certain sum for anchorage.  This was an office of considerable dignity in the time of the sherif,  but it has now sunk into insignificance. I was somewhat surprised to  find that, in so well-frequented a port as Djidda, there were no  pleasure-boats of any kind in the harbour, nor even any regular public  boatmen; but I learned that this proceeded from the jealousy    [p.24] of the custom-house officers, who forbid all craft of this  description, and even insist that the ships boats should return to the  ships after sunset.    Djidda carries on no trade by land, except with Medina and Mekka. A  caravan departs for Medina once in forty or fifty days, principally with  India goods and drugs, and is always augmented by a crowd of pilgrims  who wish to visit Mohammeds tomb. These caravans consist of from sixty  to one hundred camels, and are conducted by the Harb Bedouins. The  intercourse, however, between Djidda and Medina is more commonly carried  on by the intermediate route of Yembo, whither merchandize is sent by  sea. Besides the caravans above mentioned, others depart for Mekka  almost every evening, and at least twice a week, with goods and  provisions; and during the four months preceding the Hadj, when every  ship that arrives brings pilgrims to Djidda, this intercourse farther  increases, and caravans then set out regularly from the gate called Báb  Mekka every evening after sunset. The loaded camels take two nights to  perform the journey, resting midway at Hadda during the day; but, in  addition to these, a small caravan of asses, lightly laden, starts also  every evening, and performs the journey of fifteen or sixteen hours in  one night, arriving regularly at Mekka early in the morning. [When camels  abound, the hire of one from Djidda to Mekka is from twenty to twenty-  five piastres. In time of scarcity, or at the approach of the Hadj, from  sixty to seventy piastres are paid. During my stay, the hire of an ass  from Djidda to Mekka was twenty piastres. These prices would be  considered enormous in any other part of the Levant. Only fifteen  piastres are paid for a camel from Cairo to Suez, which is double the  distance between Djidda and Mekka.] It is by the ass-caravan that  letters are conveyed between the two towns. In time of peace, caravans  are occasionally met with on the sea-coast, towards Yemen, and the  interior of Tehama, to Mokhowa, whence corn is imported. (V. Appendix on  the Geography of the Hedjaz.)    The following enumeration of the different shops in the principal  commercial street of Djidda, may throw some light on the    [p.25] trade of the town, as well as on the mode of living of its  inhabitants.    The shops (as in all parts of Turkey) are raised several feet above  ground, and have before them, projecting into the street, a stone bench,  on which purchasers seat themselves; this is sheltered from the sun by  an awning usually made of mats fastened to high poles. Many of the shops  are only six or seven feet wide in front; the depth is generally from  ten to twelve feet, with a small private room or magazine behind.    There are twenty-seven coffee-shops.
