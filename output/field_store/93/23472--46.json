[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#8)"],[1,"of thought vibrations than otherwise and the  vibrations have much greater force and effect.\"    The first four exercises are meant to train the mind to readily obey the  commands of the mind. Take them in the privacy of your own room and never  talk of them to others. Also do not let their apparent simplicity lead  you to neglect them. If you are one of those empty-brained men who go  about talking of their exercises hoping in this way to win praise, you  will never succeed. Be serious, earnest and sincere in your work. Give  up, once for ever, all fickle-mindedness and learn to accumulate Power in  silence and through work. Prayer gives you strength to \"work\"--the answer  comes from your Larger Self--which is the Spirit of God \"brooding\" over  all and pouring strength into all. But do not fly in the face of DEITY by  expecting it to \"do the work\" for you while you go about loafing after  offering your prayer. Nonsense. That man prays who works constantly,  silently, patiently, unceasingly and intelligently.    Exercise 1.    Sit still; relax your body all over and then neck, chest, and head held  in a straight line; legs crossed one under the other and weight of the  body resting easily upon the ribs; right hand on right leg, left hand  on left leg. There should not be a single movement of the muscles in  any part of the body. Mind, you must avoid all rigidness and tension of  the body. There should not be the least strain on muscles. You should  be able to \"relax\" completely. Start with 5 minutes. Continue till you  can accomplish the 5 minutes sitting without any conscious effort,  increase to 15 minutes which is about all you need. The aim is to give  you absolute dominion over all involuntary muscular movements. It is also  an ideal \"rest-cure\" after fatiguing physical and mental exercise or  exertion. The principal thing is \"STILLNESS\" and you can, if you like,  practise it even sitting on a chair or anywhere else; the idea is one of  \"relaxation\" and physical and mental quietude. Let not the apparent  simplicity of this exercise deceive you. It is not so very easy after  all. You will find that by concentrating the mind upon a particular  train of thoughts or ideas or by joining the mind to the Larger Self,  you can easily lose all idea of the body and thus maintain this stillness  for a considerable length of time. Genius, inspiration and intuition  are more or less the scientific and psychological results of  self-forgetfulness. \"When he sits down to meditate,\" it was said of  Vivekananda, \"in 10 minutes he becomes quite unconscious of the body  although it may be black with mosquitoes.\" Do you understand now?  Absolute physical self-forgetfulness is essential to deep concentration.  Dr. Fahnestock called it the \"STATUVOLIC\" condition or that state in  which the Will-Power is really active and the 'outer-self' is totally in  abeyance and forgotten.    Exercise 2.    Cultivate a self-poised attitude and demeanour in your everyday life.  Avoid a tense, strained, nervous, fidgety manner and an over-anxious  appearance. Be easy, self-possessed and dignified in your bearing.  Be courteous, thoughtful and quiet. Mental exercise and Will-Culture  will enable you to acquire the proper carriage and demeanour. Stop  swinging your feet and moving your hands or rocking your self  backwards in your chair while talking or sitting. Stop biting your nails,  chewing your moustaches, rolling your tongue in your mouth or any  other unnecessary movement such as may have become \"second nature\"  with you while studying, reading or writing. Never twitch or jerk your  body. Never wink your eyes or look blank. Train yourself to stand  sudden and loud noises with equanimity and composure. Such things  betray lack of control. Do not let anything outside (or even within you)  disturb your composure. When engaged in conversation let your speech  be calm and measured and your voice well-controlled and even. A certain  degree of reserve should always be observed. In short, keep yourself  well under control on all occasions. You can acquire this poise by  always carrying the thoughts of \"Firmness,\" \"Self-Control\", and  \"Self-Respect\" in your mind and letting these express themselves in your  outward bearing. Avoid bluster, self-assertion, gossip, levity or light  talk, too much laughter, excitement and so forth. Too much laughter  weakens the will. Be a quiet, earnest-thinking being. Be serious. Regard  \"solitude\" as the greatest medium of self-development.    Exercise 3.    Fill a wine glass full of water and taking the glass between the fingers,  extend arm directly in front of you. Fix your eyes upon the glass and  endeavour to hold your arm so steady that no quiver will be noticeable.  Commence with one minute exercise and increase until the 5 minutes limit  is reached. Alternate right and left arms. Increase to 15 minutes.    Exercise 4.    Sit erect in your chair, with your head up, chin out and shoulders  back. Raise your right arm until it is level with your shoulders,  pointing to the right. Turn your head and fix your gaze on your hand and  hold the arm perfectly steady for one minute. Repeat with left arm.  Increase the time gradually to 5 minutes. The palms of the hands should  be turned downwards.    The following exercises are meant to aid you in getting under control,  such mental faculties will produce voluntary movements.    Exercise 5.    Sit in front of a table, placing your hands upon the table, the fists  clinched and lying with the back of the hand upon the table, the thumb  being doubled over the fingers. Fix your gaze upon the fist for awhile  and then slowly extend the thumb, keeping your whole attention fixed  upon the act, just as if it was of the greatest importance. Then slowly  extend your first finger, then your second and so on, until they are all  open and extended. Then reverse the process, closing first the little  finger and continuing the closing until the fist is again in its original  position, with the thumb closed over the fingers. Repeat with left hand.  Continue this exercise 5 times at a sitting, then increase to 10 times.  Don't forget to keep your attention closely fixed upon the finger  movements. That is the main point.    Exercise 6.    Place the fingers of one hand between the fingers of the other, leaving  the thumbs free. Then slowly twirl the thumbs one over the other, with a  circular motion. Be sure to keep the attention firmly fixed upon the end  of the thumbs.    _N.B._ Exercises Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 have been culled (with slight  modifications by me) from the works of Yogi Ramacharaka.    Exercise 7.    Forty-eight hours after the full moon in each month, go by yourself into  a darkened chamber and quietly concentrate your mind upon one thing. Do  this as long as possible without allowing other thoughts to enter your  mind. At first you will find that your thoughts will fly from one thing  to another and it will be hard for you to accomplish this, but by  continued practice you will be able to think of one thing for a long  time. This should be continued for 5 nights in succession and one hour  each night.    Exercise 8.    Go out into the open air each evening when the sky is clear and see  how many stars you can count without allowing any other thoughts to  enter your mind. The more stars you can count without thinking of  anything the greater the degree of development produced. Quite an  interesting exercise.    Exercise 9.    Take 12 ordinary pebbles. Place them in your left hand. Then with your  right hand pick up one pebble, hold it at arm's length and concentrate  your mind thereupon without allowing other thoughts for full 60 seconds.  So with all the pebbles. Then start picking up with left hand. Do this  for one hour daily.    Exercise 10.    Concentrate your mind determinedly upon some one at a distance without  allowing other thoughts. Will that he do get strong, healthy and  spiritual. Get up a mental picture of your subject as if sitting  before you. Then give earnest, positive, forceful suggestions to his  sub-conscious mind. Will that he get into sympathy with you, write you on  the subject and earnestly co-operate with you in his spiritual  regeneration. Do it calmly and earnestly.    Exercise 11.    Get some moistened sand spread over the surface about a yard square. Make  it perfectly smooth. Then with your index finger draw any characters or  pictures in the sand. For instance, a square, a triangle or any other  figure. Fasten your gaze upon this figure. Concentrate your mind calmly  thereupon and will that the thought-form so created by your concentration  be transmitted to someone (whom you know to be sensitive to your will).  Do this for 15 minutes daily at the same time till your subject gets the  impression. Ask him to sit relaxed at the same time in the _silence_ in a  receptive mental attitude. Face the direction, North, South, East or West  in which you send your thought. Imagine a psychic wire connecting you  with your subject and aim straight. Remember, the Will-Power is  represented in symbology by a straight line because it goes straight to  its mark.    Exercise 12.    Every night before retiring, concentrate upon your passive mind:  \"_When I get up in morning, my Will-power and Thought-Force will have  increased. I expect you to bring about a thorough change in my  Will-Force. It will gain in vigour, resolution, firmness and confidence.  It must grow strong, strong, strong_.\" Project these positive suggestions  into your subjective self earnestly, confidently and concentratedly. You  will progress quickly by leaps and bounds. Every morning shall find  you stronger and full of vim, sap and energy. Persevere, persevere. In  following up such ideals to a successful conclusion you must have an  (i) overpowering desire; (ii) a strong belief in your ability to  accomplish anything; (iii) an invincible determination not a backboneless  'I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#8)"],[1,"to cling till sufficiently strong to provide  for their own safety. During a severe drought that prevailed in the  northern province in 1850, the district of Caretchy was so infested by  bears that the Oriental custom of the women resorting to the wells was  altogether suspended, as it was a common occurrence to find one of these  animals in the water, unable to climb up the yielding and slippery soil,  down which its thirst had impelled it to slide during the night.    [Footnote 1: Prochilus labiatus, _Blainville_.]    [Illustration: INDIAN BEAR.]    Although the structure of the bear shows him to be naturally omnivorous,  he rarely preys upon flesh in Ceylon, and his solitary habits whilst in  search of honey and fruits render him timid and retiring. Hence he  evinces alarm on the approach of man or other animals, and, unable to  make a rapid retreat, his panic, rather than any vicious disposition,  leads him to become an assailant in self-defence. But so furious are his  assaults under such circumstances that the Singhalese have a terror of  his attack greater than that created by any other beast of the forest.  If not armed with a gun, a native, in the places where bears abound,  usually carries a light axe, called \"kodelly,\" with which to strike them  on the head. The bear, on the other hand, always aims at the face, and,  if successful in prostrating his victim, usually commences by assailing  the eyes. I have met numerous individuals on our journeys who exhibited  frightful scars from such encounters, the white seams of their wounds  contrasting hideously with the dark colour of the rest of their bodies.    The Veddahs in Bintenne, whose principal stores consist of honey, live  in dread of the bears, because, attracted by the perfume, they will  not hesitate to attack their rude dwellings, when allured by this  irresistible temptation. The Post-office runners, who always travel by  night, are frequently exposed to danger from these animals, especially  along the coast from Putlam to Aripo, where they are found in  considerable numbers; and, to guard against surprise, they are  accustomed to carry flambeaux, to give warning to the bears, and  enable them to shuffle out of the path.[1]    [Footnote 1: Amongst the Singhalese there is a belief that certain  charms are efficacious in protecting them from the violence of bears,  and those whose avocations expose them to encounters of this kind are  accustomed to carry a talisman either attached to their neck or  enveloped in the folds of their luxuriant hair. A friend of mine,  writing of an adventure which occurred at Anarajapoora, thus describes  an occasion on which a Moor, who attended him, was somewhat, rudely  disabused of his belief in the efficacy of charms upon bears:--\"Desiring  to change the position of a herd of deer, the Moorman (with his charm)  was sent across some swampy land to disturb them. As he was proceeding,  we saw him suddenly turn from an old tree and run back with all speed,  his hair becoming unfastened and like his clothes streaming in the wind.  It soon became evident that he was flying from some terrific object, for  he had thrown down his gun, and, in his panic, he was taking the  shortest line towards us, which lay across a swamp covered with sedge  and rushes that greatly impeded his progress, and prevented us  approaching him, or seeing what was the cause of his flight. Missing his  steps from one hard spot to another he repeatedly fell into the water,  but he rose and resumed his flight. I advanced as far as the sods would  bear my weight, but to go further was impracticable. Just within  ball-range there was an open space, and, as the man gained it. I saw  that he was pursued by a bear and two cubs. As the person of the  fugitive covered the bear, it was impossible to fire without risk. At  last he fall exhausted, and the bear being close upon him, I discharged  both barrels. The first broke the bear's shoulder, but this only made  her more savage, and rising on her hind legs she advanced with ferocious  prowls, when the second barrel, though I do not think it took effect,  served to frighten her, for turning round she retreated, followed by the  cubs. Some natives then waded through the mud to the Moorman, who was  just exhausted, and would have been drowned but that he fell with his  head upon a tuft of grass: the poor man was unable to speak, and for  several weeks his intellect seemed confused. The adventure sufficed to  satisfy him that he could not again depend upon a charm to protect him,  from bears, though he always insisted that but for its having fallen  from his hair where he had fastened it under his turban, the bear would  not have ventured to attack him.\"]    Leopards[1] are the only formidable members of the tiger race in  Ceylon[2], and they are neither very numerous nor very dangerous, as  they seldom attack man. By the Europeans, the Ceylon leopard is  erroneously called a _cheetah_, but the true \"cheetah\" (_felis  jubata_),' the hunting leopard of India, does not exist in the  island.[3]    [Footnote 1: Felis pardus, _Linn._ What is called a leopard, or a  cheetah, in Ceylon, is in reality the true panther.]    [Footnote 2: A belief is prevalent at Trincomalie that a Bengal tiger  inhabits the jungle in its vicinity; and the story runs that it  escaped from the wreck of a vessel on which it had been embarked for  England. Officers of the Government state positively that they have  more than once come on it whilst hunting; and one gentleman of the  Royal Engineers, who had seen it, assured me that he could not be  mistaken as to its being a tiger of India, and one of the largest  description.]    [Footnote 3: Mr. BAKER, in his _Eight Years in Ceylon_, has  stated that there are two species of leopard in the island, one of  which he implies is the Indian cheetah. But although he specifies  discrepancies in size, weight, and marking between the varieties which  he has examined, his data are not sufficient to identify any of them  with the true _felis jubata_.]    There is a rare variety of the leopard which has been found in various  parts of the island, in which the skin, instead of being spotted, is of  a uniform black.[1] Leopards frequent the vicinity of pasture hinds in  quest of the deer and other peaceful animals which resort to them; and  the villagers often complain of the destruction of their cattle by these  formidable marauders. In relation to them, the natives have a curious  but firm conviction that when a bullock is killed by a leopard, and, in  expiring, falls so that _its right side is undermost_, the leopard will  not return to devour it. I have been told by English sportsmen (some of  whom share in the popular belief), that sometimes, when they have  proposed to watch by the carcase of a bullock recently killed by a  leopard, in the hope of shooting the spoiler on his return in search of  his prey, the native owner of the slaughtered animal, though earnestly  desiring to be avenged, has assured them that it would be in vain, as  the beast having fallen on its right side, the leopard not return.    [Footnote 1: F. melas, _Peron_ and _Leseur_.]    [Illustration: LEOPARD AND CHEETAH.]    The Singhalese hunt them for the sake of their extremely beautiful  skins, but prefer taking them in traps and pitfalls, and occasionally  in spring cages formed of poles driven firmly into the ground, within  which a kid is generally fastened as a bait; the door being held open  by a sapling bent down by the united force of several men, and so  arranged as to act as a spring, to which a noose is ingeniously  attached, formed of plaited deer's hide. The cries of the kid attract  the leopard, which being tempted to enter, is enclosed by the  liberation of the spring, and grasped firmly round the body by the  noose.    Like the other carnivora, leopards are timid and cowardly in the  presence of man, never intruding on him voluntarily, and making a  hasty retreat when approached. Instances have, however, occurred of  individuals having been slain by them; and it is believed, that,  having once tasted human blood, they, like the tiger, acquire an  habitual relish for it. A peon, on duty by night at the court-house of  Anarajapoora, was some years ago carried off by a leopard from a table  in the verandah on which he had laid down his head to sleep. At  Batticaloa a \"cheetah\" in two instances in succession was known to  carry off men placed on a stage erected in a tree to drive away  elephants from rice-land: but such cases are rare, and, as compared  with their dread of the bear, the natives of Ceylon entertain but  slight apprehensions of the \"cheetah.\" It is, however, the dread of  sportsmen, whose dogs when beating in the jungle are especially  exposed to its attacks: and I am aware of an instance in which a party  having tied their dogs to the tent-pole for security, and fallen  asleep round them, a leopard sprang into the tent and carried  off a dog from the midst of its slumbering masters. On one occasion  being in the mountains near Kandy, a messenger despatched to me  through the jungle excused his delay by stating that a \"cheetah\" had  seated itself in the only practicable path, and remained quietly  licking its fore paws and rubbing them over its face, till he was  forced to drive it, with stones, into the forest.    Leopards are strongly attracted by the peculiar odour which  accompanies small-pox. The reluctance of the natives to submit  themselves or their children to vaccination exposes the island to  frightful visitations of this disease; and in the villages in the  interior it is usual on such occasions to erect huts in the jungle to  serve as temporary hospitals. Towards these the leopards are certain  to be allured; and the medical officers are obliged to resort to  increased precautions in consequence. This fact is connected with a  curious native superstition. Amongst the avenging"]]]
