Mrs. Broom,\" sighed the Tongs in his song,       \"Oh! is it because I'm so thin,      And my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--        That you don't care about me a pin?      Ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,        Ah! why don't you heed my complaint?      Must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful Broom,        Because you are covered with paint?          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          You are certainly wrong.\"                           IV.        Mrs. Broom and Miss Shovel together they sang,       \"What nonsense you're singing to-day!\"      Said the Shovel, \"I'll certainly hit you a bang!\"        Said the Broom, \"And I'll sweep you away!\"      So the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,        Perceiving their anger with pain;      But they put on the kettle, and little by little        They all became happy again.          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          There's an end of my song.          THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR.    [Illustration]                         I.        Said the Table to the Chair,      \"You can hardly be aware      How I suffer from the heat      And from chilblains on my feet.      If we took a little walk,      We might have a little talk;      Pray let us take the air,\"      Said the Table to the Chair.                           II.        Said the Chair unto the Table,      \"Now, you _know_ we are not able:      How foolishly you talk,      When you know we _cannot_ walk!\"      Said the Table with a sigh,      \"It can do no harm to try.      I've as many legs as you:      Why can't we walk on two?\"                           III.        So they both went slowly down,      And walked about the town      With a cheerful bumpy sound      As they toddled round and round;      And everybody cried,      As they hastened to their side,      \"See! the Table and the Chair      Have come out to take the air!\"                           IV.        But in going down an alley,      To a castle in a valley,      They completely lost their way,      And wandered all the day;      Till, to see them safely back,      They paid a Ducky-quack,      And a Beetle, and a Mouse,      Who took them to their house.                  [Illustration]                           V.        Then they whispered to each other,      \"O delightful little brother,      What a lovely walk we've taken!      Let us dine on beans and bacon.\"      So the Ducky and the leetle      Browny-Mousy and the Beetle      Dined, and danced upon their heads      Till they toddled to their beds.

Once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose  names were    [Illustration]    VIOLET, SLINGSBY, GUY, and LIONEL;  and they all thought they should like to see the world. So they bought a  large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come  back on the other side by land. The boat was painted blue with green spots,  and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only  took a small Cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly  Quangle-Wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which  purposes they took a large kettle.    [Illustration]    For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat,  as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea  with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle instantly cooked them; and the  Pussy-Cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased,  on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.    During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water  into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope  that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the  evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to  sleep very comfortably, while Pussy and the Quangle-Wangle managed the  boat.    [Illustration]    After a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it,  they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth.  Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great  gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful,  and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.    When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great  surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and  chocolate-drops, and nothing else. So they all climbed up the single high  tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having  remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they  naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when  they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a  million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more  than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost  delight and apathy.    [Illustration]    After this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five  great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all  fast asleep. And I am sorry to say that the Pussy-Cat and the  Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the  sixty-five parrots; for which Violet reproved them both severely.    [Illustration]    Notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two  hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a  lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    [Illustration]    The next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which  was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so  they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the  fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with  shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. And as the few fishes  who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty  they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the  arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood  in great numbers, Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for  several of the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them;  through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    [Illustration]    Then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense  orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. So they all landed,  taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges,  and place them in it. But, while they were busy about this, a most  dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers  from Violet's bonnet. That, however, was nothing compared with the calamity  of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which  thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they  were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the  sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and  amazing nature.    [Illustration]    Nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and  hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had  to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    [Illustration]    This event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they  might never have become less so, had not Lionel, with a most praiseworthy  devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to  them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so  extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that  whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial  to Lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest  token of their sincere and grateful infection.    [Illustration]    After sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another  country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless  multitude of white Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle,  slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite  demeanor.    [Illustration]    And as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating  nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as  to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their pudding in a humble  and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than  gratified. It was agreed, therefore, that Guy should go and ask the Mice,  which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell  only half full of custard diluted with water. Now, this displeased Guy, who  said, \"Out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, I must say, you might  have spared a somewhat larger quantity.\" But no sooner had he finished  speaking than the Mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an  appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more  scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous  sneezing of many millions of angry Mice); so that Guy rushed back to the  boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by  which means he completely spoiled the Mice's dinner.    [Illustration]    By and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses,  but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks,  and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. Each of these blue  bottles contained a Blue-Bottle-Fly; and all these interesting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#8)"],[1,"of civilization, testify only too clearly how seldom  this mastery is obtained. How rare indeed to meet a _man_! How common  rather to discover a creature hounded on by tyrant thoughts (or cares or  desires), cowering, wincing under the lash--or perchance priding himself  to run merrily in obedience to a driver that rattles the reins and  persuades him that he is free--whom we cannot converse with in careless  _tete-a-tete_ because that alien presence is always there, on the watch.    \"It is one of the most prominent doctrines of Raja Yoga that the power of  expelling thoughts, or if need be, killing them dead on the spot, _must_  be attained. Naturally the art requires practice, but like other arts,  when once acquired there is no mystery or difficulty about it. And it is  worth practice. It may indeed fairly be said that life only begins when  this art has been acquired. For obviously when instead of being ruled by  individual thoughts, the whole flock of them in their immense multitude  and variety and capacity is ours to direct and dispatch and employ where  we list ('for He maketh the winds his messengers and the flaming fire His  minister'), life becomes a thing so vast and grand compared with what it  was before, that its former condition may well appear almost antenatal.    \"If you can kill a thought dead, for the time being, you can do anything  else with it that you please. And therefore it is that this power is so  valuable. And it not only frees a man from mental torment (which is  nine-tenths at least of the torment of life), but it gives him a  concentrated power of handling mental work absolutely unknown to him  before. The two things are co-relative to each other. As already said  this is one of the principles of Raja Yoga.    \"While at work your thought is to be absolutely concentrated in it,  undistracted by anything whatever irrelevant to the matter in  hand--pounding away like a great engine, with giant power and perfect  economy--no wear and tear of friction, or dislocation of parts owing to  the working of different forces at the same time. Then when the work is  finished, if there is no more occasion for the use of the machine, it  must stop equally, absolutely--stop entirely--no _worrying_ (as if a  parcel of boys were allowed to play their devilments with a locomotive as  soon as it was in the shed)--and the man must retire into that region of  his consciousness where his true self dwells.    \"I say the power of the thought-machine itself is enormously increased by  this faculty of letting it alone on the one hand, and of using it singly  and with concentration on the other. It becomes a true tool, which a  master-workman lays down when done with, but which only a bungler carries  about with him all the time to show that he is the possessor of it.\"    We ask the students to read carefully the above quotations from Mr.  Carpenter's book, for they are full of suggestions that may be taken up  to advantage by those who are emancipating themselves from their slavery  to the unmastered mind, and who are now bringing the mind under control  of the Ego, by means of the Will.    Our next lesson will take up the subject of the relationship of the \"I\"  to the Universal \"I,\" and will be called the \"Expansion of the Self.\" It  will deal with the subject, not from a theoretical standpoint, but from  the position of the teacher who is endeavoring to make his students  actually _aware_ in their consciousness of the truth of the proposition.  In this course we are not trying to make our students past-masters of  _theory_, but are endeavoring to place them in a position whereby they  may _know_ for themselves, and actually experience the things of which we  teach.    Therefore we urge upon you not to merely rest content with reading this  lesson, but, instead, to study and meditate upon the teachings mentioned  under the head of \"Mental Drill,\" until the distinctions stand out  clearly in your mind, and until you not only _believe_ them to be true,  but actually are _conscious_ of the \"I\" and its Mental Tools. Have  patience and perseverance. The task may be difficult, but the reward is  great. To become conscious of the greatness, majesty, strength and power  of your real being is worth years of hard study. Do you not think so?  Then study and practice hopefully, diligently and earnestly.    Peace be with you.      MANTRAMS (AFFIRMATIONS) FOR THE SECOND LESSON.    \"I\" am an entity--my mind is my instrument of expression.    \"I\" exist independent of my mind, and am not dependent upon it for  existence or being.    \"I\" am Master of my mind, not its slave.    \"I\" can set aside my sensations, emotions, passions, desires,  intellectual faculties, and all the rest of my mental collection of  tools, as \"not I\" things--and still there remains something--and that  something is \"I,\" which cannot be set aside by me, for it is my very  self; my only self; my real self--\"I.\" That which remains after all that  may be set aside _is_ set aside is the \"I\"--Myself--eternal, constant,  unchangeable.    [Illustration: \"I am\"]          THE THIRD LESSON.    THE EXPANSION OF THE SELF.      In the first two lessons of this course we have endeavored to bring to  the candidate a realization in consciousness of the reality of the \"I,\"  and to enable him to distinguish between the Self and its sheaths,  physical and mental. In the present lesson we will call his attention to  the relationship of the \"I\" to the Universal \"I,\" and will endeavor to  give him an idea of a greater, grander Self, transcending personality  and the little self that we are so apt to regard as the \"I.\"    The keynote of this lesson will be \"The Oneness of All,\" and all of its  teachings will be directed to awakening a realization in consciousness of  that great truth. But we wish to impress upon the mind of the Candidate  that we are _not_ teaching him that he is the Absolute. We are not  teaching the \"I Am God\" belief, which we consider to be erroneous and  misleading, and a perversion of the original Yogi teachings. This false  teaching has taken possession of many of the Hindu teachers and people,  and with its accompanying teaching of \"Maya\" or the complete illusion or  non-existence of the Universe, has reduced millions of people to a  passive, negative mental condition which undoubtedly is retarding their  progress. Not only in India is this true, but the same facts may be  observed among the pupils of the Western teachers who have embraced this  negative side of the Oriental Philosophy. Such people confound the  \"Absolute\" and \"Relative\" aspects of the One, and, being unable to  reconcile the facts of Life and the Universe with their theories of \"I Am  God,\" they are driven to the desperate expedient of boldly denying the  Universe, and declaring it to be all \"an illusion\" or \"Maya.\"    You will have no trouble in distinguishing the pupils of the teachers  holding this view. They will be found to exhibit the most negative mental  condition--a natural result of absorbing the constant suggestion of  \"nothingness\"--the gospel of negation. In marked contrast to the mental  condition of the students, however, will be observed the mental attitude  of the teachers, who are almost uniformly examples of vital, positive,  mental force, capable of hurling their teaching into the minds of the  pupils--of driving in their statements by the force of an awakened Will.  The teacher, as a rule, has awakened to a sense of the \"I\" consciousness,  and really develops the same by his \"I Am God\" attitude, because by  holding this mental attitude he is enabled to throw off the influence of  the sheaths of the lower mental principles, and the light of the Self  shows forth fiercely and strongly, sometimes to such an extent that it  fairly scorches the mentality of the less advanced pupil. But,  notwithstanding this awakened \"I\" consciousness, the teacher is  handicapped by his intellectual misconception and befogging metaphysics,  and is unable to impart the \"I\" consciousness to his pupils, and, instead  of raising them up to shine with equal splendor with himself, he really  forces them into a shadow by reason of his teachings.    Our students, of course, will understand that the above is not written in  the spirit of carping criticism or fault-finding. We hold no such mental  attitude, and indeed could not if we remain true to our conception of  Truth. We are mentioning these matters simply that the student may avoid  this \"I Am God\" pitfall which awaits the Candidate just as he has well  started on the Path. It would not be such a serious matter if it were  merely a question of faulty metaphysics, for that would straighten itself  out in time. But it is far more serious than this, for the teaching  inevitably leads to the accompanying teaching that all is Illusion or  _Maya_, and that Life is but a dream--a false thing--a lie--a nightmare;  that the journey along the Path is but an illusion; that everything is  \"nothing\"; that there is no soul; that You are God in disguise, and that  He is fooling Himself in making believe that He is You; that Life is but  a Divine masquerade or sleight-of-hand performance; that You are God, but  that You (God) are fooling Yourself (God) in order to amuse Yourself  (God). Is not this horrible? And yet it shows to what lengths the human  mind will go before it will part with some pet theory of metaphysics with  which it has been hypnotized. Do you think that we have overdrawn the  picture? Then read some of the teachings of these schools of the Oriental  Philosophy, or listen to some of the more radical of the Western teachers  preaching this philosophy. The majority of the latter lack the courage of  the Hindu teachers in carrying their theories to a logical conclusion,  and, consequently they veil their teachings with metaphysical subtlety.  But a few of them are more courageous, and come out into the open and  preach their"]]]
