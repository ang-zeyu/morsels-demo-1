Is it not 'A hasty  man burneth his mouth, and the fool that keepeth his eyes shut falleth  into the pit'? Thus he says, truly, therefore we must meet guile with  guile. Now some of you clothe yourselves as curtal friars, and some as  rustic peasants, and some as tinkers, or as beggars, but see that each  man taketh a good bow or broadsword, in case need should arise. As for  myself, I will shoot for this same golden arrow, and should I win it, we  will hang it to the branches of our good greenwood tree for the joy of  all the band. How like you the plan, my merry men all?\"    Then \"Good, good!\" cried all the band right heartily.    A fair sight was Nottingham Town on the day of the shooting match. All  along upon the green meadow beneath the town wall stretched a row of  benches, one above the other, which were for knight and lady, squire and  dame, and rich burghers and their wives; for none but those of rank and  quality were to sit there. At the end of the range, near the target, was  a raised seat bedecked with ribbons and scarfs and garlands of flowers,  for the Sheriff of Nottingham and his dame. The range was twoscore  paces broad. At one end stood the target, at the other a tent of  striped canvas, from the pole of which fluttered many-colored flags and  streamers. In this booth were casks of ale, free to be broached by any  of the archers who might wish to quench their thirst.    Across the range from where the seats for the better folk were raised  was a railing to keep the poorer people from crowding in front of the  target. Already, while it was early, the benches were beginning to fill  with people of quality, who kept constantly arriving in little carts or  upon palfreys that curveted gaily to the merry tinkle of silver bells at  bridle reins. With these came also the poorer folk, who sat or lay upon  the green grass near the railing that kept them from off the range.  In the great tent the archers were gathering by twos and threes; some  talking loudly of the fair shots each man had made in his day; some  looking well to their bows, drawing a string betwixt the fingers to see  that there was no fray upon it, or inspecting arrows, shutting one eye  and peering down a shaft to see that it was not warped, but straight and  true, for neither bow nor shaft should fail at such a time and for such  a prize. And never was such a company of yeomen as were gathered at  Nottingham Town that day, for the very best archers of merry England  had come to this shooting match. There was Gill o' the Red Cap, the  Sheriff's own head archer, and Diccon Cruikshank of Lincoln Town, and  Adam o' the Dell, a man of Tamworth, of threescore years and more, yet  hale and lusty still, who in his time had shot in the famous match  at Woodstock, and had there beaten that renowned archer, Clym o' the  Clough. And many more famous men of the longbow were there, whose names  have been handed down to us in goodly ballads of the olden time.    But now all the benches were filled with guests, lord and lady, burgher  and dame, when at last the Sheriff himself came with his lady, he riding  with stately mien upon his milk-white horse and she upon her brown  filly. Upon his head he wore a purple velvet cap, and purple velvet was  his robe, all trimmed about with rich ermine; his jerkin and hose were  of sea-green silk, and his shoes of black velvet, the pointed toes  fastened to his garters with golden chains. A golden chain hung about  his neck, and at his collar was a great carbuncle set in red gold. His  lady was dressed in blue velvet, all trimmed with swan's down. So they  made a gallant sight as they rode along side by side, and all the people  shouted from where they crowded across the space from the gentlefolk;  so the Sheriff and his lady came to their place, where men-at-arms, with  hauberk and spear, stood about, waiting for them.    Then when the Sheriff and his dame had sat down, he bade his herald  wind upon his silver horn; who thereupon sounded three blasts that  came echoing cheerily back from the gray walls of Nottingham. Then the  archers stepped forth to their places, while all the folks shouted with  a mighty voice, each man calling upon his favorite yeoman. \"Red Cap!\"  cried some; \"Cruikshank!\" cried others; \"Hey for William o' Leslie!\"  shouted others yet again; while ladies waved silken scarfs to urge each  yeoman to do his best.    Then the herald stood forth and loudly proclaimed the rules of the game  as follows:    \"Shoot each man from yon mark, which is sevenscore yards and ten from  the target. One arrow shooteth each man first, and from all the archers  shall the ten that shooteth the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot  again. Two arrows shooteth each man of these ten, then shall the three  that shoot the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot again. Three arrows  shooteth each man of those three, and to him that shooteth the fairest  shafts shall the prize be given.\"    Then the Sheriff leaned forward, looking keenly among the press of  archers to find whether Robin Hood was among them; but no one was  there clad in Lincoln green, such as was worn by Robin and his band.  \"Nevertheless,\" said the Sheriff to himself, \"he may still be there, and  I miss him among the crowd of other men. But let me see when but ten men  shoot, for I wot he will be among the ten, or I know him not.\"    And now the archers shot, each man in turn, and the good folk never saw  such archery as was done that day. Six arrows were within the clout,  four within the black, and only two smote the outer ring; so that when  the last arrow sped and struck the target, all the people shouted aloud,  for it was noble shooting.    And now but ten men were left of all those that had shot before, and  of these ten, six were famous throughout the land, and most of the folk  gathered there knew them. These six men were Gilbert o' the Red Cap,  Adam o' the Dell, Diccon Cruikshank, William o' Leslie, Hubert o' Cloud,  and Swithin o' Hertford. Two others were yeomen of merry Yorkshire,  another was a tall stranger in blue, who said he came from London Town,  and the last was a tattered stranger in scarlet, who wore a patch over  one eye.    \"Now,\" quoth the Sheriff to a man-at-arms who stood near him, \"seest  thou Robin Hood among those ten?\"    \"Nay, that do I not, Your Worship,\" answered the man. \"Six of them I  know right well. Of those Yorkshire yeomen, one is too tall and the  other too short for that bold knave. Robin's beard is as yellow as gold,  while yon tattered beggar in scarlet hath a beard of brown, besides  being blind of one eye. As for the stranger in blue, Robin's shoulders,  I ween, are three inches broader than his.\"    \"Then,\" quoth the Sheriff, smiting his thigh angrily, \"yon knave is a  coward as well as a rogue, and dares not show his face among good men  and true.\"    Then, after they had rested a short time, those ten stout men stepped  forth to shoot again. Each man shot two arrows, and as they shot, not  a word was spoken, but all the crowd watched with scarce a breath of  sound; but when the last had shot his arrow another great shout arose,  while many cast their caps aloft for joy of such marvelous shooting.    \"Now by our gracious Lady fair,\" quoth old Sir Amyas o' the Dell, who,  bowed with fourscore years and more, sat near the Sheriff, \"ne'er saw  I such archery in all my life before, yet have I seen the best hands at  the longbow for threescore years and more.\"    And now but three men were left of all those that had shot before. One  was Gill o' the Red Cap, one the tattered stranger in scarlet, and one  Adam o' the Dell of Tamworth Town. Then all the people called aloud,  some crying, \"Ho for Gilbert o' the Red Cap!\" and some, \"Hey for stout  Adam o' Tamworth!\" But not a single man in the crowd called upon the  stranger in scarlet.    \"Now, shoot thou well, Gilbert,\" cried the Sheriff, \"and if thine be the  best shaft, fivescore broad silver pennies will I give to thee beside  the prize.\"    \"Truly I will do my best,\" quoth Gilbert right sturdily. \"A man cannot  do aught but his best, but that will I strive to do this day.\" So  saying, he drew forth a fair smooth arrow with a broad feather and  fitted it deftly to the string, then drawing his bow with care he  sped the shaft. Straight flew the arrow and lit fairly in the clout, a  finger's-breadth from the center. \"A Gilbert, a Gilbert!\" shouted all  the crowd; and, \"Now, by my faith,\" cried the Sheriff, smiting his hands  together, \"that is a shrewd shot.\"    Then the tattered stranger stepped forth, and all the people laughed as  they saw a yellow patch that showed beneath his arm when he raised his  elbow to shoot, and also to see him aim with but one eye. He drew the  good yew bow quickly, and quickly loosed a shaft; so short was the time  that no man could draw a breath betwixt the drawing and the shooting;  yet his arrow lodged nearer the center than the other by twice the  length of a barleycorn.    \"Now by all the saints in Paradise!\" cried the Sheriff, \"that is a  lovely shaft in very truth!\"    Then Adam o' the Dell shot, carefully and cautiously, and his arrow  lodged close beside the stranger's. Then after a short space they all  three shot again, and once more each arrow lodged within the clout, but  this time Adam o' the Dell's was farthest from the center, and again the  tattered stranger's shot was the best. Then, after another time of rest,  they all shot for the third time. This time Gilbert took great heed to  his aim, keenly measuring the distance and shooting with shrewdest care.  Straight flew the arrow, and all shouted till the very flags that  waved in the breeze shook with the sound, and the rooks and daws flew  clamoring about the roofs of the old gray tower, for the shaft had  lodged close beside the spot that marked the very center.    \"Well done, Gilbert!\" cried the Sheriff right joyously. \"Fain am I  to believe"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#7)"],[1,"of the street along which the carriage was to proceed,  and its stream moved roaring and rapid, as if lashed on by a hurricane.    \"Stop and get off,\" said John to the coachman; \"it is useless to go any  farther; we are lost!\"    \"Here they are! here they are!\" five hundred voices were crying at the  same time.    \"Yes, here they are, the traitors, the murderers, the assassins!\"  answered the men who were running after the carriage to the people who  were coming to meet it. The former carried in their arms the bruised  body of one of their companions, who, trying to seize the reins of the  horses, had been trodden down by them.    This was the object over which the two brothers had felt their carriage  pass.    The coachman stopped, but, however strongly his master urged him, he  refused to get off and save himself.    In an instant the carriage was hemmed in between those who followed and  those who met it. It rose above the mass of moving heads like a floating  island. But in another instant it came to a dead stop. A blacksmith had  with his hammer struck down one of the horses, which fell in the traces.    At this moment, the shutter of a window opened, and disclosed the sallow  face and the dark eyes of the young man, who with intense interest  watched the scene which was preparing. Behind him appeared the head of  the officer, almost as pale as himself.    \"Good heavens, Monseigneur, what is going on there?\" whispered the  officer.    \"Something very terrible, to a certainty,\" replied the other.    \"Don't you see, Monseigneur, they are dragging the Grand Pensionary from  the carriage, they strike him, they tear him to pieces!\"    \"Indeed, these people must certainly be prompted by a most violent  indignation,\" said the young man, with the same impassible tone which  he had preserved all along.    \"And here is Cornelius, whom they now likewise drag out of the  carriage,--Cornelius, who is already quite broken and mangled by the  torture. Only look, look!\"    \"Indeed, it is Cornelius, and no mistake.\"    The officer uttered a feeble cry, and turned his head away; the brother  of the Grand Pensionary, before having set foot on the ground, whilst  still on the bottom step of the carriage, was struck down with an iron  bar which broke his skull. He rose once more, but immediately fell  again.    Some fellows then seized him by the feet, and dragged him into the  crowd, into the middle of which one might have followed his bloody  track, and he was soon closed in among the savage yells of malignant  exultation.    The young man--a thing which would have been thought impossible--grew  even paler than before, and his eyes were for a moment veiled behind the  lids.    The officer saw this sign of compassion, and, wishing to avail himself  of this softened tone of his feelings, continued,--    \"Come, come, Monseigneur, for here they are also going to murder the  Grand Pensionary.\"    But the young man had already opened his eyes again.    \"To be sure,\" he said. \"These people are really implacable. It does no  one good to offend them.\"    \"Monseigneur,\" said the officer, \"may not one save this poor man, who  has been your Highness's instructor? If there be any means, name it, and  if I should perish in the attempt----\"    William of Orange--for he it was--knit his brows in a very forbidding  manner, restrained the glance of gloomy malice which glistened in his  half-closed eye, and answered,--    \"Captain Van Deken, I request you to go and look after my troops, that  they may be armed for any emergency.\"    \"But am I to leave your Highness here, alone, in the presence of all  these murderers?\"    \"Go, and don't you trouble yourself about me more than I do myself,\" the  Prince gruffly replied.    The officer started off with a speed which was much less owing to his  sense of military obedience than to his pleasure at being relieved from  the necessity of witnessing the shocking spectacle of the murder of the  other brother.    He had scarcely left the room, when John--who, with an almost superhuman  effort, had reached the stone steps of a house nearly opposite that  where his former pupil concealed himself--began to stagger under the  blows which were inflicted on him from all sides, calling out,--    \"My brother! where is my brother?\"    One of the ruffians knocked off his hat with a blow of his clenched  fist.    Another showed to him his bloody hands; for this fellow had ripped open  Cornelius and disembowelled him, and was now hastening to the spot in  order not to lose the opportunity of serving the Grand Pensionary in the  same manner, whilst they were dragging the dead body of Cornelius to the  gibbet.    John uttered a cry of agony and grief, and put one of his hands before  his eyes.    \"Oh, you close your eyes, do you?\" said one of the soldiers of the  burgher guard; \"well, I shall open them for you.\"    And saying this he stabbed him with his pike in the face, and the blood  spurted forth.    \"My brother!\" cried John de Witt, trying to see through the stream of  blood which blinded him, what had become of Cornelius; \"my brother, my  brother!\"    \"Go and run after him!\" bellowed another murderer, putting his musket to  his temples and pulling the trigger.    But the gun did not go off.    The fellow then turned his musket round, and, taking it by the barrel  with both hands, struck John de Witt down with the butt-end. John  staggered and fell down at his feet, but, raising himself with a last  effort, he once more called out,--    \"My brother!\" with a voice so full of anguish that the young man  opposite closed the shutter.    There remained little more to see; a third murderer fired a pistol with  the muzzle to his face; and this time the shot took effect, blowing out  his brains. John de Witt fell to rise no more.    On this, every one of the miscreants, emboldened by his fall, wanted to  fire his gun at him, or strike him with blows of the sledge-hammer,  or stab him with a knife or swords, every one wanted to draw a drop of  blood from the fallen hero, and tear off a shred from his garments.    And after having mangled, and torn, and completely stripped the  two brothers, the mob dragged their naked and bloody bodies to an  extemporised gibbet, where amateur executioners hung them up by the  feet.    Then came the most dastardly scoundrels of all, who not having dared to  strike the living flesh, cut the dead in pieces, and then went about  the town selling small slices of the bodies of John and Cornelius at ten  sous a piece.    We cannot take upon ourselves to say whether, through the almost  imperceptible chink of the shutter, the young man witnessed the  conclusion of this shocking scene; but at the very moment when they were  hanging the two martyrs on the gibbet he passed through the terrible  mob, which was too much absorbed in the task, so grateful to its taste,  to take any notice of him, and thus he reached unobserved the Tol-Hek,  which was still closed.    \"Ah! sir,\" said the gatekeeper, \"do you bring me the key?\"    \"Yes, my man, here it is.\"    \"It is most unfortunate that you did not bring me that key only one  quarter of an hour sooner,\" said the gatekeeper, with a sigh.    \"And why that?\" asked the other.    \"Because I might have opened the gate to Mynheers de Witt; whereas,  finding the gate locked, they were obliged to retrace their steps.\"    \"Gate! gate!\" cried a voice which seemed to be that of a man in a hurry.    The Prince, turning round, observed Captain Van Deken.    \"Is that you, Captain?\" he said. \"You are not yet out of the Hague? This  is executing my orders very slowly.\"    \"Monseigneur,\" replied the Captain, \"this is the third gate at which I  have presented myself; the other two were closed.\"    \"Well, this good man will open this one for you; do it, my friend.\"    The last words were addressed to the gatekeeper, who stood quite  thunderstruck on hearing Captain Van Deken addressing by the title of  Monseigneur this pale young man, to whom he himself had spoken in such a  familiar way.    As it were to make up for his fault, he hastened to open the gate, which  swung creaking on its hinges.    \"Will Monseigneur avail himself of my horse?\" asked the Captain.    \"I thank you, Captain, I shall use my own steed, which is waiting for me  close at hand.\"    And taking from his pocket a golden whistle, such as was generally used  at that time for summoning the servants, he sounded it with a shrill  and prolonged call, on which an equerry on horseback speedily made his  appearance, leading another horse by the bridle.    William, without touching the stirrup, vaulted into the saddle of the  led horse, and, setting his spurs into its flanks, started off for the  Leyden road. Having reached it, he turned round and beckoned to the  Captain who was far behind, to ride by his side.    \"Do you know,\" he then said, without stopping, \"that those rascals have  killed John de Witt as well as his brother?\"    \"Alas! Monseigneur,\" the Captain answered sadly, \"I should like it much  better if these two difficulties were still in your Highness's way of  becoming de facto Stadtholder of Holland.\"    \"Certainly, it would have been better,\" said William, \"if what did  happen had not happened. But it cannot be helped now, and we have had  nothing to do with it. Let us push on, Captain, that we may arrive at  Alphen before the message which the States-General are sure to send to  me to the camp.\"    The Captain bowed, allowed the Prince to ride ahead and, for the  remainder of the journey, kept at the same respectful distance as he had  done before his Highness called him to his side.    \"How I should wish,\" William of Orange malignantly muttered to himself,  with a dark frown and setting the spurs to his horse, \"to see the figure  which Louis will cut when he is apprised of the manner in which his dear  friends De Witt have been served! Oh thou Sun! thou Sun! as truly as  I am called"]]]
