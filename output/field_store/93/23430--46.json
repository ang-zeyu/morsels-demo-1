The latter part of this story accords but ill with what De Bourgueville  relates. We learn from this author, that four hundred and thirty years  subsequent to the death of the Conqueror, a Roman cardinal, attended by an  archbishop and bishop, visited the town of Caen, and that his eminence  having expressed a wish to see the body of the duke, the monks yielded to  his curiosity, the tomb was opened, and the corpse discovered in so  perfect a state that the cardinal caused a portrait to be taken from the  lifeless features. It is not worth while now to inquire into the truth of  this story, or the fidelity of the resemblance. The painting has  disappeared in the course of time: it hung for awhile against the walls of  the church, opposite to the monument, but it was stolen during the tumults  caused by the Huguenots, and was broken into two pieces, in which state De  Bourgueville saw it a few years afterwards, in the hands of a Calvinist,  one Peter Hode, the gaoler at Caen, who used it in the double capacity of  a table and a door. The worthy magistrate states, that he kept the picture,  \"because the abbey-church was demolished.\"    He was himself present at the second violation of the royal tomb, in 1572;  and he gives a piteous account of the transaction. The monument raised to  the memory of the Conqueror, by his son. William Rufus, under the  superintendance of Lanfrane, was a production of much costly and elaborate  workmanship; the shrine, which was placed upon the mausoleum, glittered  with gold and silver and precious stones. To complete the whole, the  effigy of the king had been added to the tomb at some period subsequent to  its original erection. A monument like this naturally excited the rapacity  of a lawless banditti, unrestrained by civil or military force, and  inveterate against every thing that might be regarded as connected with  the Catholic worship. The Calvinists were masters of Caen, and, incited by  the information of what had taken place at Rouen, they resolved to repeat  the same outrages. Under the specious pretext of abolishing idolatrous  worship, they pillaged and ransacked every church and monastery: they  broke the windows and organs, destroyed the images, stole the  ecclesiastical ornaments, sold the shrines, committed pulpits, chests,  books, and whatever was combustible, to the fire; and finally, after  having wreaked their vengeance upon every thing that could be made the  object of it, they went boldly to the town-hall to demand the wages for  their labours. In the course of these outrages the tomb of the Conqueror  at one abbey and that of Matilda, his queen, at the other, were demolished.  And this was not enough; but a few days afterwards, the same band returned,  allured by the hopes of farther plunder. They dug up the coffin: the  hollow stone rang to the strokes of their daggers: the vibration proved  that it was not filled by the corpse, and nothing more was wanting to seal  its destruction.    De Bourgueville, who went to the spot and exerted his eloquence to check  this last act of violence, witnessed the opening of the coffin. It  contained the bones of the king, wrapped up in red taffety, and still in  tolerable preservation; but nothing else. He collected them with care, and  consigned them to one of the monks of the abbey, who kept them in his  chamber, till the Admiral de Chatillon entered Caen at the head of his  mercenaries, on which occasion the whole abbey was plundered, and the  monks put to flight, and the bones lost. \"Sad doings these,\" says De  Bourgueville, \"_et bien peu reformez!_\" He adds that one of the  thigh-bones was preserved by the Viscount of Falaise, who was there with  him, and begged it from the rioters, and that this bone was longer by four  fingers' breadth than that of a tall man. The bone thus preserved, was  reinterred, after the cessation of the troubles: it is the same that is  alluded to in the inscription, which also informs us that a monument was  raised over it in 1642, but was removed in 1742, it being then considered  as an incumbrance in the choir.    The melancholy end of the Conqueror, the strange occurrences at his  interment, the violation of his grave, the dispersion of his remains, and  the demolition and final removal of his monument, are circumstances  calculated to excite melancholy emotions in the mind of every one,  whatever his condition in life. In all these events, the religious man  traces the hand of retributive justice; the philosopher regards the  nullity of sublunary grandeur; the historian finds matter for serious  reflection; the poet for affecting narrative; and the moralist for his  tale.    J.R.S.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SKETCH-BOOK.    THE PICNIC AT TEMPE.      It was the most sultry of the dog-days--Jupiter sat lolling in his arm  chair vainly endeavouring to get a quiet nap, and a little further sat  Minerva, lulling her father to sleep, as _she_ thought, and keeping him  awake, as _he_ thought, by the whirring noise of her spinning-wheel. At  length Venus entered the saloon in which they were sitting, and the noise  she made effectually aroused the Thunderer. \"Venus, my darling, where's  your mother-in-law?\" said Jupiter raising himself on his elbow.    \"In her dressing room,\" replied Venus, \"trying on some of my new  beautifying inventions.\"    \"Ah,\" smiled Jupiter, \"you women are never easy but when you're  beautifying yourselves: well, go and tell her I think we may as well take  a trip down to Tempe, by way of employment this hot day; and send Iris to  tell all the other gods to meet us there.\"    Away tripped Venus to execute her commission, and the Thunderer turned  again to doze; but suddenly a thought struck him: \"Here, Pallas, go and  borrow Mars's curricle for Juno and myself to ride in, for it is much too  hot to think of walking, such a day as this, and tell him to put some  bottles of nectar in the driving box, d'ye hear?\"    In a short time the curricle made its appearance, and Jove and Juno  mounted. But Mars's vehicle was constructed for a single gentleman, and  not for man and wife, who being rather too heavy for it, broke it down as  they descended Olympus, and rolled to the foot of the mountain amidst the  suppressed laughter of the other gods, who were winging their way down.  Iris was despatched to procure a fresh supply of nectar, which Bacchus  declared would nearly exhaust his stock. At last the table was spread in  the most delightful part of Tempe, and the top of Ossa was occupied by  Hercules with his club to see that no mortal intruded on the revels of the  gods, when Jupiter discovered something at a distance running at full  speed towards them. \"Heyday! what have we here?\" he exclaimed; \"as I live,  my old friend Cerberus, with a note in his jaws; why what _can_ Pluto have  got to say? Here, Cer! Cer! Cer! good dog!\" The breathless animal dropped  the letter at Jupiter's feet and then took his seat on the ground, panting,  as well he might, after so long a journey.    \"Here's a pretty note,\" said Jupiter, and he proceeded to read it aloud  for the amusement of the company--        \"Dear Jove,        \"Knowing you are going to have a feast at Tempe I have sent my      favourite Cerberus to pick up the crumbs as he gets but poor      living in the shades here at Tartarus. Proserpine sends her love      to Ceres.        \"Yours ever,        \"PLUTO.\"        N.B. \"Send Cerberus back at night.\"    \"Faugh! how it stinks of brimstone!\" said Jupiter, \"we'll give poor  Cerberus a meal though, for he looks woefully thin; I should not think  Pluto gave him much from his appearance.\" So down they sat, Cerberus and  Jove's eagle being installed under the table, while Minerva's owl, Juno's  peacock, and the proteges of the other immortals were left to pick up what  they could outside. They had not sat long before the noise of a vast  contention was heard, and the cause being sought, it was discovered to be  a bone which Jupiter had thrown under the table, and which was violently  contested by Cerberus and the eagle. Peace was restored by the expulsion  of the offending eagle, as Jove said he ought to know better, having come  from Olympus, while Cerberus was brought up in Tartarus. All went on  quietly for a time, when Cerberus unfortunately squatted himself down on  Jupiter's thunderbolt, which its master had dropped under the table, and  giving a most terrific yell, rushed between the legs of Mercury's chair,  and upset him in a twinkling, while, almost before he could rise, poor  Cerberus was treading the \"facilis descensus Averni,\" with his posteriors  sadly blackened by the accident; and roaring with pain as the gods were  with laughter. Dinner passed on without any more accidents, and when the  ladies retired, Vulcan and Mars sat down to ecarte, at which the former  proved the winner. Apollo drily remarked, (having just finished his daily  journey and joined the gods) that Vulcan had netted Mars's cash as well as  himself. Mars rose in a great rage, when Jupiter recommended him not to be  nettled, which only made him ten times more so. A quarrel was the  consequence; and Jupiter thinking it best to return before bloodshed was  committed, asked Apollo to yoke his team again, and drive them home, which  he readily consented to do: that night seemed unusually light to the  inhabitants of the hemisphere, and many learned heads were puzzled to  discover the cause of the phenomenon, but though many explanations were  given, the real reason remained undiscovered to this day--in which I have  the pleasure of laying it before my readers.

He  called it using his advantages. He now determined not to begin the game  with D'Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary's cards.    \"My lord, have you any commands?\" asked Bernouin.    \"Yes, yes,\" replied Mazarin. \"Light me; I am going to the queen.\"    Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way.    There was a secret communication between the cardinal's apartments and  those of the queen; and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever  he wished to visit Anne of Austria.        _*This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal._    In the bedroom in which this passage ended, Bernouin encountered Madame  de Beauvais, like himself intrusted with the secret of these  subterranean love affairs; and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare  Anne of Austria, who was in her oratory with the young king, Louis XIV.,  to receive the cardinal.    Anne, reclining in a large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand,  her elbow resting on a table, was looking at her son, who was turning  over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures. This celebrated  woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity. It was her  practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room, without  either reading or praying.    When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal,  the child, who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius,  enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander's feats of arms,  frowned and looked at his mother.    \"Why,\" he said, \"does he enter without first asking for an audience?\"    Anne colored slightly.    \"The prime minister,\" she said, \"is obliged in these unsettled days to  inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time, without  exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court.\"    \"But Richelieu never came in this manner,\" said the pertinacious boy.    \"How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did? You were too young  to know about such things.\"    \"I do not remember what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told  all about it.\"    \"And who told you about it?\" asked Anne of Austria, with a movement of  impatience.    \"I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions,\"  answered the child, \"for if I do I shall learn nothing further.\"    At this very moment Mazarin entered. The king rose immediately, took his  book, closed it and went to lay it down on the table, near which he  continued standing, in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand  also.    Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance. They  explained what had occurred that evening.    He bowed respectfully to the king, who gave him a somewhat cavalier  reception, but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which,  from his infancy, Louis XIV. had entertained toward Mazarin, and he  endeavored to receive the minister's homage with civility.    Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarin's face the occasion of this  unexpected visit, since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only  after every one had retired.    The minister made a slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said  to Madame Beauvais:    \"It is time for the king to go to bed; call Laporte.\"    The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to  bed, and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he  was; but now he made no reply, but turned pale and bit his lips with  anger.    In a few minutes Laporte came into the room. The child went directly to  him without kissing his mother.    \"Well, Louis,\" said Anne, \"why do you not kiss me?\"    \"I thought you were angry with me, madame; you sent me away.\"    \"I do not send you away, but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid  that sitting up late may tire you.\"    \"You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the  palace to-day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to  rebellion.\"    \"Sire!\" interposed Laporte, in order to turn the subject, \"to whom does  your majesty wish me to give the candle?\"    \"To any one, Laporte,\" the child said; and then added in a loud voice,  \"to any one except Mancini.\"    Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarin's and was as much hated by Louis as  the cardinal himself, although placed near his person by the minister.    And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or  even bowing to the cardinal.    \"Good,\" said Mazarin, \"I am glad to see that his majesty has been  brought up with a hatred of dissimulation.\"    \"Why do you say that?\" asked the queen, almost timidly.    \"Why, it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no  explanation. Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little  affection he has for me. That, however, does not hinder me from being  entirely devoted to his service, as I am to that of your majesty.\"    \"I ask your pardon for him, cardinal,\" said the queen; \"he is a child,  not yet able to understand his obligations to you.\"    The cardinal smiled.    \"But,\" continued the queen, \"you have doubtless come for some important  purpose. What is it, then?\"    Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his  countenance.    \"It is likely,\" he replied, \"that we shall soon be obliged to separate,  unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy.\"    \"Why,\" cried the queen; \"how is that?\"    \"Because, as they say in the opera of 'Thisbe,' 'The whole world  conspires to break our bonds.'\"    \"You jest, sir!\" answered the queen, endeavoring to assume something of  her former dignity.    \"Alas! I do not, madame,\" rejoined Mazarin. \"Mark well what I say. The  whole world conspires to break our bonds. Now as you are one of the  whole world, I mean to say that you also are deserting me.\"    \"Cardinal!\"    \"Heavens! did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans?  or rather at what he said?\"    \"And what was he saying?\"    \"He said this, madame: 'Mazarin is a stumbling-block. Send him away and  all will then be well.'\"    \"What do you wish me to do?\"    \"Oh, madame! you are the queen!\"    \"Queen, forsooth! when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the  Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense, or of every country  squire in the kingdom.\"    \"Nevertheless, you have still the power of banishing from your presence  those whom you do not like!\"    \"That is to say, whom you do not like,\" returned the queen.    \"I! persons whom I do not like!\"    \"Yes, indeed. Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been  persecuted twelve years under the last reign?\"    \"A woman of intrigue, who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of  cabal she had raised against M. de Richelieu.\"    \"Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort, that friend so loyal that she  refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine?\"    \"A prude, who told you every night, as she undressed you, that it was a  sin to love a priest, just as if one were a priest because one happens  to be a cardinal.\"    \"Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested?\"    \"An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate  me.\"    \"You see, cardinal,\" replied the queen, \"that your enemies are mine.\"    \"That is not enough madame, it is necessary that your friends should be  also mine.\"    \"My friends, monsieur?\" The queen shook her head. \"Alas, I have them no  longer!\"    \"How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many  in adversity?\"    \"It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends, monsieur;  because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis, who, returning from  her first exile, treated with contempt all those who had suffered for  her and, being proscribed a second time, died at Cologne abandoned by  every one, even by her own son.\"    \"Well, let us see,\" said Mazarin; \"isn't there still time to repair the  evil? Search among your friends, your oldest friends.\"    \"What do you mean, monsieur?\"    \"Nothing else than I say--search.\"    \"Alas, I look around me in vain! I have no influence with any one.  Monsieur is, as usual, led by his favorite; yesterday it was Choisy,  to-day it is La Riviere, to-morrow it will be some one else. Monsieur le  Prince is led by the coadjutor, who is led by Madame de Guemenee.\"    \"Therefore, madame, I ask you to look, not among your friends of to-day,  but among those of other times.\"    \"Among my friends of other times?\" said the queen.    \"Yes, among your friends of other times; among those who aided you to  contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him.\"    \"What is he aiming at?\" murmured the queen, looking uneasily at the  cardinal.    \"Yes,\" continued his eminence; \"under certain circumstances, with that  strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses, aided by your friends,  you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary.\"    \"I!\" said the queen. \"I suffered, that is all.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mazarin, \"as women suffer in avenging themselves. Come, let  us come to the point. Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort?\"    \"One of my bitterest enemies--the faithful friend of Cardinal  Richelieu.\"    \"I know that, and we sent him to the Bastile,\" said Mazarin.    \"Is he at liberty?\" asked the queen.    \"No; still there, but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce  the name of another man. Do you know Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" he added,  looking steadfastly at the queen.    Anne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart.    \"Has the Gascon been indiscreet?\" she murmured to herself, then said  aloud:    \"D'Artagnan! stop an instant, the name seems certainly familiar.  D'Artagnan! there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women.  Poor young creature! she was poisoned on my account.\"    \"That's all you know of him?\" asked Mazarin.    The queen looked at him, surprised.    \"You seem, sir,\" she remarked, \"to be making me undergo a course of  cross-examination.\"    \"Which you answer"]]]
