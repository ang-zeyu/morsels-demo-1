So that night the little Wild Thing slept in the farmer's house, but  her new soul stayed awake the whole night long dreaming of the  beauty of the marshes.    As soon as dawn came over the waste and shone on the farmer's house,  she looked from the window towards the glittering waters, and saw  the inner beauty of the marsh.  For the Wild Things only love the  marsh and know its haunts, but now she perceived the mystery of its  distances and the glamour of its perilous pools, with their fair and  deadly mosses, and felt the marvel of the North Wind who comes  dominant out of unknown icy lands, and the wonder of that ebb and  flow of life when the wildfowl whirl in at evening to the marshlands  and at dawn pass out to sea.  And she knew that over her head above  the farmer's house stretched wide Paradise, where perhaps God was  now imagining a sunrise while angels played low on lutes, and the  sun came rising up on the world below to gladden fields and marsh.    And all that heaven thought, the marsh thought too; for the blue of  the marsh was as the blue of heaven, and the great cloud shapes in  heaven became the shapes in the marsh, and through each ran  momentary rivers of purple, errant between banks of gold.  And the  stalwart army of reeds appeared out of the gloom with all their  pennons waving as far as the eye could see.  And from another window  she saw the vast cathedral gathering its ponderous strength  together, and lifting it up in towers out of the marshlands.    She said, 'I will never, never leave the marsh.'    An hour later she dressed with great difficulty and went down to eat  the second meal of her life.  The farmer and his wife were kindly  folk, and taught her how to eat.    'I suppose the gipsies don't have knives and forks,' one said to the  other afterwards.    After breakfast the farmer went and saw the Dean, who lived near his  cathedral, and presently returned and brought back to the Dean's  house the little Wild Thing with the new soul.    'This is the lady,' said the farmer.  'This is Dean Murnith.' Then he  went away.    'Ah,' said the Dean, 'I understand you were lost the other night in  the marshes.  It was a terrible night to be lost in the marshes.'    'I love the marshes,' said the little Wild Thing with the new soul.    'Indeed!  How old are you?' said the Dean.    'I don't know,' she answered.    'You must know about how old you are,' he said.    'Oh, about ninety,' she said, 'or more.'    'Ninety years!' exclaimed the Dean.    'No, ninety centuries,' she said; 'I am as old as the marshes.'    Then she told her story--how she had longed to be a human and go and  worship God, and have a soul and see the beauty of the world, and  how all the Wild Things had made her a soul of gossamer and mist and  music and strange memories.    'But if this is true,' said Dean Murnith, 'this is very wrong.  God  cannot have intended you to have a soul.    'What is your name?'    'I have no name,' she answered.    'We must find a Christian name and a surname for you.  What would you  like to be called?'    'Song of the Rushes,' she said.    'That won't do at all,' said the Dean.    'Then I would like to be called Terrible North Wind, or Star in the  Waters,' she said.    'No, no, no,' said Dean Murnith; 'that is quite impossible.  We could  call you Miss Rush if you like.  How would Mary Rush do? Perhaps you  had better have another name--say Mary Jane Rush.'    So the little Wild Thing with the soul of the marshes took the names  that were offered her, and became Mary Jane Rush.    'And we must find something for you to do,' said Dean Murnith.  'Meanwhile we can give you a room here.'    'I don't want to do anything,' replied Mary Jane; 'I want to worship  God in the cathedral and live beside the marshes.'    Then Mrs. Murnith came in, and for the rest of that day Mary Jane  stayed at the house of the Dean.    And there with her new soul she  perceived the beauty of the world; for it came grey and level out  of misty distances, and widened into grassy fields and ploughlands  right up to the edge of an old gabled town; and solitary in the  fields far off an ancient windmill stood, and his honest hand-made  sails went round and round in the free East Anglian winds.  Close by,  the gabled houses leaned out over the streets, planted fair upon  sturdy timbers that grew in the olden time, all glorying among  themselves upon their beauty.  And out of them, buttress by buttress,  growing and going upwards, aspiring tower by tower, rose the  cathedral.    And she saw the people moving in the streets all  leisurely and slow, and unseen among them, whispering to each other,  unheard by living men and concerned only with bygone things, drifted  the ghosts of very long ago.  And wherever the streets ran eastwards,  wherever were gaps in the houses, always there broke into view the  sight of the great marshes, like to some bar of music weird and  strange that haunts a melody, arising again and again, played on the  violin by one musician only, who plays no other bar, and he is swart  and lank about the hair and bearded about the lips, and his  moustache droops long and low, and no one knows the land from which  he comes.    All these were good things for a new soul to see.    Then the sun set over green fields and ploughland and the night came  up.  One by one the merry lights of cheery lamp-lit windows took  their stations in the solemn night.    Then the bells rang, far up in a cathedral tower,  and their melody fell on the roofs of the old houses and poured over  their eaves until the streets were full, and then flooded away over  green fields and plough, till it came to the sturdy mill and brought  the miller trudging to evensong, and far away eastwards and seawards  the sound rang out over the remoter marshes.  And it was all as  yesterday to the old ghosts in the streets.    Then the Dean's wife took Mary Jane to evening service, and she saw  three hundred candles filling all the aisle with light.  But sturdy  pillars stood there in unlit vastnesses; great colonnades going away  into the gloom, where evening and morning, year in year out, they  did their work in the dark, holding the cathedral roof aloft.  And it  was stiller than the marshes are still when the ice has come and the  wind that brought it has fallen.    Suddenly into this stillness rushed the sound of the organ, roaring,  and presently the people prayed and sang.    No longer could Mary Jane  see their prayers ascending like thin gold chains, for that was but  an elfin fancy, but she imagined clear in her new soul the seraphs  passing in the ways of Paradise, and the angels changing guard to  watch the World by night.    When the Dean had finished service, a young curate, Mr. Millings,  went up into the pulpit.    He spoke of Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus: and Mary Jane was  glad that there were rivers having such names, and heard with wonder  of Nineveh, that great city, and many things strange and new.    And the light of the candles shone on the curate's fair hair, and  his voice went ringing down the aisle, and Mary Jane rejoiced that  he was there.    But when his voice stopped she felt a sudden  loneliness, such as she had not felt since the making of the  marshes; for the Wild Things never are lonely and never unhappy, but  dance all night on the reflection of the stars, and having no  souls, desire nothing more.    After the collection was made, before anyone moved to go, Mary Jane  walked up the aisle to Mr. Millings.    'I love you,' she said.      Chapter II    Nobody sympathised with Mary Jane.    'So unfortunate for Mr. Millings,' every one said; 'such a promising  young man.'    Mary Jane was sent away to a great manufacturing city of the  Midlands, where work had been found for her in a cloth factory.  And  there was nothing in that town that was good for a soul to see.  For  it did not know that beauty was to be desired; so it made many  things by machinery, and became hurried in all its ways, and boasted  its superiority over other cities and became richer and richer, and  there was none to pity it.    In this city Mary Jane had had lodgings found for her near the  factory.    At six o'clock on those November mornings, about the time that, far  away from the city, the wildfowl rose up out of the calm marshes and  passed to the troubled spaces of the sea, at six o'clock the factory  uttered a prolonged howl and gathered the workers together, and  there they worked, saving two hours for food, the whole of the  daylit hours and into the dark till the bells tolled six again.    There Mary Jane worked with other girls in a long dreary room, where  giants sat pounding wool into a long thread-like strip with iron,  rasping hands.  And all day long they roared as they sat at their  soulless work.  But the work of Mary Jane was not with these, only  their roar was ever in her ears as their clattering iron limbs went  to and fro.    Her work was to tend a creature smaller, but infinitely more  cunning.    It took the strip of wool that the giants had threshed, and whirled  it round and round until it had twisted it into hard thin thread.  Then it would make a clutch with fingers of steel at the thread that  it had gathered, and waddle away about five yards and come back with  more.    It had mastered all the subtlety of skilled workers, and had  gradually displaced them; one thing only it could not do, it was  unable to pick up the ends if a piece of the thread broke, in order  to tie them together again.  For this a human soul was required, and  it was Mary Jane's business to pick up broken ends; and the moment  she placed them together the busy soulless creature tied them for  itself.    All here was ugly; even the green wool as it whirled round and round  was neither the green of the grass nor yet "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10814"],[0,"Legends, Tales and Poems (#8)"],[1," (1) _When two contiguous vowel's are strong._    (a) There is no diphthong if one of two contiguous strong vowels  receives the accent.      Ex. _Chispe|ando el sol hiere_, p. 173, XXVI I, l. 17.      Ex. _Tu, sombra a|erea que, cuantas veces_, p. 170, XV, l. 7.    By synaeresis, however, a diphthong may be formed, especially in the  combinations a^o, a^e, o^e--_c^a^o^s, c^a^e, ro^e_. But in order to  diphthongize oa, ea, and eo, when the accent naturally falls on the  first vowel, the accent must shift to the second, which is a dominant  vowel. Such diphthongization is harsh. For example, _loa_ would shift  the accent from o to a in order to form a diphthong. The accent would  also shift in _cre^a, fe^o_.    (2) _When one of the contiguous vowels is weak and the other strong._    (a) There is no diphthong if an accented weak vowel precedes a strong.      Ex. _Yo, que a tus ojos en mi agoni|a_, p. 171, XV, l. 18.    Synaeresis is, however, sometimes employed to overcome this rule.    The accent must then shift.      Ex. _Habi^a llegado una nave._ Calderon.    (b) There is no diphthong if an accented weak vowel follows a strong.      Ex. _?Como puede re|ir?_ p. 182, XLIX, l. 4.    Synaeresis serves sometimes to overcome this rule. The result is  usually harsh.      Ex. _En re^ir a costa ajena, les prepara._    (c) If an accented strong vowel precedes a weak, they form a  diphthong. The diphthong is rarely dissolved, and is usually marked  with a diaresis, if dissolution takes place.      Ex. _Beso del aura, onda de luz_, p. 170, XV, l. 5.    (d) If an accented strong vowel follows a weak they may or may not  form a diphthong.      Ex. _Por una sonrisa, un ci^elo_, p. 172, XXIII, l. 2. [Diphthong.]      Ex. _Domando el rebelde, mezquino idi|oma_, p. 164, I, l. 6. [No    diphthong.]    Diaeresis or synaeresis may usually be employed according to the case.    Thus, _fiel_ becomes by diaeresis _fi|el_, and _br|ioso_ becomes by  synaeresis _bri^oso_.    It should be remembered that in some words the accentuation is  variable, while in others it is fixed.    There are two classes of words that have a variable accentuation:  first, those in which an unaccented weak vowel is followed by an  accented strong vowel, e.g. _majestu^oso_, _majestu|oso_; second,  those in which an accented strong vowel is followed by an unaccented  strong vowel, e.g. _tra|e, tra^e._      Ex. _Cre^es que la afe|an_. Becquer.       _Cre|es que suspirando pasa el viento_, p. 171, XVI, l. 3.    Etymological conditions often determine whether or not a diphthong is  formed.    ie and ue, derived from the Latin e and o respectively, form  indissoluble diphthongs.    The ending -ion for substantives is usually a diphthong and rarely  suffers dissolution.    Synaeresis may be employed to unite in a single syllable two  contiguous vowels (unaccented weak + accented strong) that are  separated on account of etymology, or, in the case of derivatives,  analogy with the original word; but diaeresis is employed very rarely  to dissolve a proper diphthongal combination (unaccented weak +  accented strong).    For example, _di|ario_ by analogy with _dia_, and _fi|o_ from the  Latin _fidavit_, have ordinarily the _i_ in separate syllables, but a  diphthong may be formed by synaeresis.    (3) _When the two contiguous vowels are weak_.    (a) Two contiguous weak vowels with the accent on the first form an  indissoluble diphthong, e.g. _mu^y_.    (b) Two contiguous weak vowels with the accent on the second may or  may not form a diphthong.      Ex. _Si antes no juras que por ru^in falsia_. Hermosilla.    [Diphthong.]      Ex. _Con sus mil rue|idos_, p. 188, LXXIII, l. 19, [No diphthong.]    c. Two contiguous vowels after the accented syllable.    (1) Two contiguous strong vowels after the accented syllable naturally  form a diphthong.      Ex. _Tu, sombra aere^a que, cuantas veces_, p. 170, XV, l. 7.    Diaeresis may be employed to dissolve the diphthong.    (2) If a strong vowel is followed by a weak vowel after the accented  syllable, they form a diphthong, e.g. _hablaba^is, amara^is_.    This diphthong is easily dissolved.    (3) If a weak vowel is followed by a strong vowel after the accented  syllable, they form a diphthong, e.g. _histor^i^a, ans^i^a_.      Ex. _De la brisa nocturna al tenu^e soplo_, p. 192, LXXV, l. 6.    The diphthong may, however, be dissolved, e.g. _estatu|a, tenu|e,  nadi|e_.    3. TRIPHTHONGS AND COMBINATIONS OP THREE OR MORE CONTIGUOUS VOWELS    If three vowels belonging to the same word are contiguous, one of them  must be accented. There are then three possible arrangements.    (i) Three contiguous vowels of a word with the accent on the first,  e.g. _traeos_.    (ii) Three contiguous vowels of a word with the accent on the second,  e.g. creia, _buey_.    (iii) Three contiguous vowels with the accent on the third, e.g.  _rehui_.    Each of the above arrangements has two combinations of accented and  unaccented vowels to which the rules for diphthongs may be applied. In  (i) there will be a combination of two vowels with the first accented,  plus a combination of two vowels after the accent. In _traeos_, for  example, the a and e would probably be in separate syllables by b (1)  (a), and eo would probably form a diphthong by c (1). _Traeos_ would,  then, probably be a dissyllable.    In (ii) there will be a combination of two vowels with the accent an  the second, and one of two vowels with the accent on the first. In  creia, for example, the e and i would be in separate syllables by b  (2) (b), and the i and a would probably be in separate syllables also  by b (2)(a). Therefore, _creia_ would probably be a trisyllable. In  _cambiaos_ the i and a might form one syllable or two by b (2) (_d_),  and the a and o would probably be in separate syllables by b (1) (a).  Therefore, in _cambiaos_ the combination iao might form a dissyllable  or a trisyllable.    In (iii) there will be a combination of two vowels before the accent,  and one of two vowels with the second accented. In _rehui_, for  example, the e and u might be in the same syllable by a (1), or in  separate syllables by dieresis by a (1) (a), and the u and i might be  in separate syllables or not by b (3) (b). Therefore, _rehui_ might be  a monosyllable, a dissyllable, or a trisyllable.    Other combinations of three vowels may be analyzed in a similar way,  as may also combinations of more than three vowels, e.g. _creiais_,  etc.      B. SYNALEPHA    Between the contiguous vowels of separate words there may occur  synalepha (which corresponds to diphthongization within a word), or  hiatus (which is similar to diaeresis within a word).      Ex. _Abre^una^eternidad_, p. 178, XXXVI I, l. 22. _?A que me lo    decis? lo se^:^es mudable_, p. 179, XXXIX, l. 1. [Synalepha.]      Ex. _Como la onda^azul, en cuya cresta_, p. 173, XXVII, l. 16.    [Hiatus.]    The vowels contracted by synalepha are each pronounced, except when  the same vowel is repeated, when only a prolonged sound is heard, as  in _onda^azul_ or _se^es_ above.    Synalepha may join into a single syllable two, three, four, and even  five vowels. The union of two vowels (diphthongal synalepha) and the  union of three vowels (triphthongal synalepha) are the most common.    A pause due to a break in sense does not prevent synalepha. Mute h is  disregarded in the verse and does not prevent synalepha.      Ex. _Capaz de encerrarlo, y apenas ioh^hermosa!_ p. 164, I, l. 10.        DIPHTHONGAL SYNALEPHA      Synalepha takes place between two contiguous unaccented vowels  belonging to separate words.      Ex. _Abre^una^eternidad_, p. 178, XXXVII, l. 22.    Synalepha occurs when the final vowel of the first word is accented.      Ex. _Te vi^un punto, y, flotando ante mis ojos_, p. 169, XIV, l. 1.    Synalepha usually occurs when the initial vowel of the second word is  accented, especially when the first word ends in a weak vowel, and  also in the combinations aa, oa, oa, ea, eo, ee.      Ex. _Me parece^en el cielo de la tarde_, p. 169, XIII, l. 11.    NOTE: Synalepha is possible with the other combinations, but hiatus is  preferable even with the above combinations, in a syllable on which  the rhythmical accent falls (see under Rhythmic Accent).      Ex. _Despierta, hablas, y al hablar, vibrantes_, p. 174, XXVII, l.    23.      Ex. _Como la ola que a la playa_ viene, p. 178, XXXVII, l. 19.        TRIPHTHONGAL SYNALEPHA      There is always triphthongal synalepha when a is the middle vowel; or  when o or e is the middle vowel, except in the following combinations,  aoa, aoo, ooo, aea, aeo, oea, oeo.      Ex. _Silenciosa a expirar_, p. 178, XXXVII, l. 20.    There is never triphthongal synalepha when an accented weak vowel  stands between two strong vowels. Therefore the conjunctions y and u  prevent triphthongal synalepha.      Ex. _Y de purpura y oro la matiza_, p. 168, IX, l. 4.    There may be triphthongal synalepha when i (y) is the middle vowel, if  u precedes it, or i follows it.      Ex. _Fui diestro, fui valiente, fui arrogante_. Cervantes.    When u is the middle vowel there may be synalepha if i follows it. The  construction is very rare.    There is no synalepha with a word beginning with hue.      Ex. _Mucho nuestro huesped tarda_. Tirso de Molina.    In the following cases the groups of vowels which would usually make  triphthongal synalepha are pronounced in two syllables:    (1) When the first word of the group ends in two vowels which do not  form a diphthong.      Ex. _Que aun teni|a^abiertos_, p. 187, LXXIII, l. 2.    (2) When the two initial vowels of the second word do not form a  diphthong.      Ex. _Tu, sombra^a|erea que, cuantas veces_, p. 170, XV, l. 7.    (3) When the first word ends in a diphthong and the second begins with  a vowel in a constituent syllable (i.e. a syllable on which the  rhythmical accent falls).      Ex. _Tan gran designio honra tus audacias._    If the accented vowel is not in a"]]]
