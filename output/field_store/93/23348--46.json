It was this very vein of prudence, keeping always in view the object  to be attained, and in a broad, non-Jesuitical sense subordinating the  means to the end, that enabled Douglass to prolong his usefulness a  generation after the abolition of slavery. Douglass in his _Life and  Times_ states his own case as follows:    \"After a time, a careful reconsideration of the subject convinced  me that there was no necessity for dissolving the union between the  Northern and Southern States; that to seek this dissolution was no  part of my duty as an abolitionist; that to abstain from voting was  to refuse to exercise a legitimate and powerful means for abolishing  slavery; and that the Constitution of the United States not only  contained no guarantees in favor of slavery, but, on the contrary, was  in its letter and spirit an anti-slavery instrument, demanding the  abolition of slavery as a condition of its own existence, as the  supreme law of the land.\"    This opinion was not exactly the opinion of the majority of the  Liberty party, which did not question the constitutionality of slavery  in the slave States. Neither was it the opinion of the Supreme Court,  which in the Dred Scott case held that the Constitution guaranteed  not only the right to hold slaves, but to hold them in free States.  Nevertheless, entertaining the views he did, Douglass was able to  support the measures which sought to oppose slavery through political  action. In August, 1848, while his Garrisonian views were as yet  unchanged, he had been present as a spectator at the Free Soil  Convention at Buffalo. In his Life and Times he says of this  gathering: \"This Buffalo Convention of Free Soilers, however low their  standard, did lay the foundation of a grand superstructure. It was a  powerful link in the chain of events by which the slave system has  been abolished, the slave emancipated, and the country saved from  dismemberment.\" In 1851 Douglass announced that his sympathies were  with the voting abolitionists, and thenceforth he supported by voice  and pen Hale, Fremont, and Lincoln, the successive candidates of the  new party.    Douglass's political defection very much intensified the feeling  against him among his former coadjutors. The Garrisonians, with their  usual plain speaking, did not hesitate to say what they thought of  Douglass. Their three papers, the _Liberator_, the _Standard_, and the  _Freeman_, assailed Douglass fiercely, and charged him with treachery,  inconsistency, ingratitude, and all the other crimes so easily imputed  to one who changes his opinions. Garrison and Phillips and others of  his former associates denounced him as a deserter, and attributed his  change of heart to mercenary motives. Douglass seems to have borne  himself with rare dignity and moderation in this trying period. He  realized perfectly well that he was on the defensive, and that the  burden devolved upon him to justify his change of front. This he seems  to have attempted vigorously, but by argument rather than invective.  Even during the height of the indignation against him Douglass  disclaimed any desire to antagonize his former associates. He simply  realized that there was more than one way to fight slavery,--which  knew a dozen ways to maintain itself,--and had concluded to select the  one that seemed most practical. He was quite willing that his former  friends should go their own way. \"No personal assaults,\" he wrote to  George Thompson, the English abolitionist, who wrote to him for an  explanation of the charges made against him, \"shall ever lead me to  forget that some, who in America have often made me the subject  of personal abuse, are in their own way earnestly working for the  abolition of slavery.\"    In later years, when political action had resulted in abolition, some  of these harsh judgments were modified, and Douglass and his earlier  friends met in peace and harmony. The debt he owed to William Lloyd  Garrison he ever delighted to acknowledge. His speech on the death of  Garrison breathes in every word the love and honor in which he held  him. In one of the last chapters of his _Life and Times_ he makes a  sweeping acknowledgment of his obligations to the men and women who  rendered his career possible.    \"It was my good fortune,\" he writes, \"to get out of slavery at the  right time, to be speedily brought in contact with that circle of  highly cultivated men and women, banded together for the overthrow of  slavery, of which William Lloyd Garrison was the acknowledged leader.  To these friends, earnest, courageous, inflexible, ready to own me as  a man and a brother, against all the scorn, contempt, and derision of  a slavery-polluted atmosphere, I owe my success in life.\"          VIII.      Events moved rapidly in the decade preceding the war. In 1850 the new  Fugitive Slave Law brought discouragement to the hearts of the friends  of liberty. Douglass's utterances during this period breathed the  fiery indignation which he felt when the slave-driver's whip was heard  cracking over the free States, and all citizens were ordered to aid  in the enforcement of this inhuman statute when called upon. This law  really defeated its own purpose. There were thousands of conservative  Northern men, who, recognizing the constitutional guarantees of  slavery and the difficulty of abolishing it unless the South should  take the initiative, were content that it should be preserved intact  so long as it remained a local institution. But when the attempt was  made to make the North wash the South's dirty linen, and transform  every man in the Northern States into a slave-catcher, it wrought a  revulsion of feeling that aroused widespread sympathy for the slave  and strengthened the cause of freedom amazingly. Thousands of escaped  slaves were living in Northern communities. Some of them had acquired  homes, had educated their children, and in some States had become  citizens and voters. Already social pariahs, restricted generally to  menial labor, bearing the burdens of poverty and prejudice, they now  had thrust before them the spectre of the kidnapper, the slave-catcher  with his affidavit, and the United States [Supreme] Court, which  was made by this law the subservient tool of tyranny. This law gave  Douglass and the other abolitionists a new text. It was a set-back to  their cause; but they were not entirely disheartened, for they saw in  it the desperate expedients by which it was sought to bolster up an  institution already doomed by the advancing tide of civilization.    The loss of slaves had become a serious drain upon the border States.  The number of refugees settled in the North was, of course, largely  a matter of estimate. Runaway slaves were not apt to advertise their  status, but rather to conceal it, so that most estimates were more  likely to be under than over the truth. Henry Wilson places the number  in the free States at twenty thousand. There were in Boston in 1850,  according to a public statement of Theodore Parker, from four to six  hundred; and in other New England towns, notably New Bedford, the  number was large. Other estimates place the figures much higher. Mr.  Siebert, in his _Underground Railroad_, after a careful calculation  from the best obtainable data, puts the number of fugitives aided in  Ohio alone at forty thousand in the thirty years preceding 1860, and  in the same period nine thousand in the city of Philadelphia alone,  which was one of the principal stations of the underground railroad  and the home of William Still, whose elaborate work on the  _Underground Railroad_ gives the details of many thrilling escapes.    In the work of assisting runaway slaves Douglass found congenial  employment. It was exciting and dangerous, but inspiring and  soul-satisfying. He kept a room in his house always ready for  fugitives, having with him as many as eleven at a time. He would keep  them over night, pay their fare on the train for Canada, and give them  half a dollar extra. And Canada, to her eternal honor be it said,  received these assisted emigrants, with their fifty cents apiece, of  alien race, debauched by slavery, gave them welcome and protection,  refused to enter into diplomatic relations for their rendition to  bondage, and spoke well of them as men and citizens when Henry Clay  and the other slave [pro-slavery] leaders denounced them as the most  worthless of their class. The example of Canada may be commended to  those persons in the United States, of little faith, who, because in  thirty years the emancipated race have not equalled the white man in  achievement, are fearful lest nothing good can be expected of them.    In the stirring years of the early fifties Douglass led a busy life.  He had each week to fill the columns of his paper and raise the money  to pay its expenses. Add to this his platform work and the underground  railroad work, which consisted not only in personal aid to the  fugitives, but in raising money to pay their expenses, and his time  was very adequately employed. In every anti-slavery meeting his face  was welcome, and his position as a representative of his own peculiar  people was daily strengthened.    When Uncle Tom's Cabin, in 1852, set the world on fire over the wrongs  of the slave,--or rather the wrongs of slavery, for that wonderful  book did not portray the negro as the only sufferer from this hoary  iniquity,--Mrs. Stowe, in her new capacity as a champion of liberty,  conceived the plan of raising a fund for the benefit of the colored  race, and in 1853 invited Douglass to visit her at Andover,  Massachusetts, where she consulted with him in reference to the  establishment of an industrial institute or trades school for colored  youth, with a view to improving their condition in the free States.  Douglass approved heartily of this plan, and through his paper made  himself its sponsor."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#8)"],[1,"Frederick Pollock has  pointed out, Spinoza has in a manner \"counted thought twice over\" while  treating of the only two infinite attributes cognizable to us, we need  not, on that account, surrender his luminous idea of God as a Being  absolutely infinite, that is, \"Substance consisting of infinite  Attributes, whereof each one expresses eternal and infinite being.\" Nor  need we abandon his supplementary but essential idea of \"Modes\" or  \"modifications\" which mould the attributes into the varieties of finite  worlds, known and unknown. Thus it may be that, in Spinoza's sense of  the word \"Attribute,\" we shall have to confess that only one comes  within our human ken, that of Thought in a sense which includes feeling.  But if the late Herbert Spencer, apart from his synthetic philosophy of  phenomena, has left any permanent mark on the religions consciousness,  it has been by a consecration of the mystery of the ultimate  Unknowable.[17] And in the spirit of reverence thus taught by him we may  still hold with Spinoza that the Eternal has an infinity of other  attributes with their infinite modifications not within our cognizance.  This would only be an enlarged application of Hamlet's words:      \"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"    Or, to put it in another way, the Universe perceptible to us is only one  of an infinity of Universes. By which is not meant an infinite  extension of galaxies in space, but the co-existence and, so to speak,  interpenetration of an infinity of modes of existence imperceptible to  us.    [Sidenote: God Is Identical with the Whole of Being.]    To Spinoza, then, God is the totality of Being. But it is not to be  inferred that he identified God with the visible, or with any  conceivable Universe. For either of these must fall far short of  infinity, and the Being of God is infinite. All I mean, when I say that  Spinoza identifies God with the totality of existence, is that he  regards the deity as that Perfect Being without beginning or end, whose  essence it is to be, and of whom all that exists, whether known to us or  not, is separately a partial, and comprehensively a perfect expression.    [Sidenote: His Doctrine of Man.]    Of more practical interest to us perhaps is Spinoza's doctrine of man,  though it would have been impossible to explain that without first  indicating his idea of God. In his view, then, man is a finite mode of  the two divine attributes, extension and thought. Thus both the extended  body and the conscious mind have their substance and reality in God.[18]  But the essence of man does not necessarily involve his separate  existence as the essence of God implies Being. Of course the substance  of man is imperishable because it is of God's substance. Nay, there is a  sense in which each man, being an eternal thought of God, has an aspect  towards eternity or exists \"sub specie eternitatis.\" But that is a truth  transcending the finite practical world with which we have to do.    [Sidenote: Illustration by the Vortex Theory.]    [Sidenote: Distinction between Man and Beast.]    According to Spinoza, what constitutes the real essence of the human  mind is the (divine) idea of a certain individual creature actually  existing.[19] Here, perhaps, modern speculations about the constitution  of matter may help us--if we use them with due reserve--to grasp  Spinoza's notion of a \"res singularis in actu\"--or as it might be  rendered freely, \"a creature of individual functions,\" for what is  called the \"vortex theory,\" though as old as Cartesian philosophy, has  recently flashed into sudden prominence. And whether or no the  speculation be only a passing phase of human thought about the  Unknowable, it equally answers the purpose of illustration. Thus the  so-called \"ether\" is supposed to fill all space; and within it there are  imagined or inferred innumerable \"tourbillons\" or \"vortices,\" which,  though parts of the indefinitely extended ether, form by their  self-contained motion little worlds in themselves. These little worlds  are by some regarded as the atoms which, by composition, and  differentiation, build up our palpable universe. With the possibilities  of such a theory I have nothing to do. But the notion of the vortex in  the ether may perhaps help us to a glimpse of Spinoza's notion when he  speaks of a \"res singularis in actu\" a creature of individual functions.  For to him man was, as it were, an infinitesimal vortex in a phase or  attribute of the divine Substance. The analogy, like all other  analogies, would not bear being pressed. But it does suggest to us a  picture of finite individuality in action or function, subordinated to  unity with infinite Substance. If it be said that such an explanation  would necessarily include the conscious life of beasts and birds, the  answer would seem to be, that admitting this to be the case, yet in man  the divine idea of individuality is more fully expressed and has more of  reality than in any lower creature.    [Sidenote: Moral Difficulties.]    Man, then, according to Spinoza, is in God and of God. But what are we  to say of bad men, the vile, the base, the liar, the murderer? Are they  also in God and of God? Spinoza does not blench. Yes, they are. But here  comes in his doctrine of \"adequate\" and \"inadequate ideas.\" Thus, if you  see the colour red it completely expresses itself. It cannot be defined  and needs no explanation.[20] As it is in the Infinite Thought so it is  in ours. We have an \"adequate idea\" of it. But now if you see on an  artist's canvas a splotch of red and blue and yellow, part of a work  only begun, it gives you no adequate idea. True, you have an adequate  idea of each several colour, but not of their relations to the work  conceived. To get that you would have to enter into the mind of the  artist and see as he sees. Then the splotch of colour would take its  place as part of a harmonious whole; and would give you an adequate idea  just as it does to the artist.    [Sidenote: But the Universe Is Not an Unfinished Picture.]    [Sidenote: It is an Eternal Whole, of which a Partial consideration is  Misleading.]    Now, according to Spinoza, when we see things as they appear in Infinite  Thought we have an adequate idea. But if we see only a component element  in an idea--let us say--of the divine Artist, then our idea is  inadequate.[21] Hence we misjudge things. And of the part played by bad  men in the divine Whole we certainly have no adequate idea. But here  again we must be on our guard against the abuse of illustrations. For it  is not to be inferred that Spinoza regards the Universe as an unfinished  picture, of which, the completion will justify the beginning. On the  contrary, the Universe is to him eternal, the necessary expression of  the infinite attributes of eternal Being. Still the analogy may help us.  For the concentration of attention on a single part of an ordered whole  may, quite as certainly as a glance at an unfinished work, be the  occasion of an inadequate idea. In effect, the suggestion is that if we,  like God, could contemplate the infinite Universe all at once, and have  an adequate idea thereof, in other words if we could ascend to the self  contemplation of the Eternal, we should have the bliss associated by  long habit with the words of the Psalmist: \"I shall be satisfied when I  awake, with thy likeness.\" Such bliss, however, is only approximately  attainable in moments of mystic transport. And when, as in so many  experiences, we see only in part, and have inadequate ideas, faith in  the Eternal Whole is needed to keep us from blasphemy.    [Sidenote: Doctrine of Man Resumed.]    [Sidenote: Final Cause Replaced by Idea.]    [Sidenote: Freedom, Purity, Love.]    With such necessarily brief hints as to Spinoza's attitude towards evil,  I resume his doctrine of man--the individual creature as a centre of  action. Of final causes Spinoza will not hear. But if instead of asking  \"what is the chief end of man,\" we ask what is the idea of man, Spinoza  answers that it is the realization of a mode of the divine attributes,  extension and thought. And if this should seem unsatisfying, let it be  remembered that to this devout Pantheist the divine attributes and  their modes were the expression of the very substance and life of God.  Now with \"extension,\" for reasons already given, we need not trouble  ourselves except to say that at least Spinoza's teaching would suggest  the idea of _mens sana in corpore sano_. Because to him the mind was the  \"idea\" of the body, and the body the \"object\"--not quite in the modern  sense--of the mind. But as regards the human mode of the divine  attribute of thought, Spinoza makes its ideal to be a life absorbed in  such contemplation of \"the Blessed God,\" the infinite Whole, as shall  react on the creature in inspirations of freedom, purity and love.    [Sidenote: Idea of Freedom.]    And first as to freedom, Spinoza means by this not caprice, nor the  monstrous miracle of causeless action, but independence of external  force or of any disproportionate and illegitimate passion. The freedom  to which he aspires is the freedom of God, who eternally acts in  accordance with the mutual harmony of the whole attributes of His  nature, not one of which clashes with another. So Spinoza's free man is  one in whom all aspirations and energies, converging in one resultant,  the expression of the divine idea, move him in harmony with the  Universe. From such a point of view the quibbles about \"free will,\" in  the sense of causeless action, cease to have any meaning. For if the  good man says \"I could have done otherwise if I had liked,\" the obvious  reply is, \"Yes, but you would not have liked.\" Because the will is not a  separate faculty, but the expression of the whole nature, as that exists  at the moment of \"willing.\" And the only real freedom is the unimpeded"]]]
