A bet was laid by a gentleman that he would procure an Indian thief  who should steal the sheet from under a person without waking him. The  thing was effected in the following manner:--the Bheel approaching the  person, who lay on his side, from behind, carefully folded up the  sheet in small compact plaits till it reached his back; then, taking a  feather, he tickled the nose of the sleeper, who immediately scratched  his face and rolled over on the other side, when with a slight effort  he completely released the sheet, and bore it off in triumph.--_Twelve  Years' Military Adventures_.           *       *       *       *       *      EDUCATION AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE LOWER CLASSES.      A correspondent of the _Gardener's Magazine_ observes that \"next to  the existing school societies, there is nothing I am more anxious to  see, or would more gladly contribute to, than a _Society for promoting  the Rational Amusements of the Lower Classes_, the first aim of which  should be to instruct itinerant teachers of music, singing, and  dancing, in improved modes of imparting their arts, and thus fairly  set the plan agoing, when it would soon work its own way, and might  then be extended to higher objects. The taste for flowers among the  Paisley weavers, for gooseberry-growing at Manchester, and for music  among the west of Yorkshire clothiers, originally sprang up from  imitation of one or two amateurs of each pursuit; and there only needs  a similar _first impulse_, which a society with a few thousands a year  might give, to spread a general taste for music, singing, and dancing,  and ultimately for other branches of the fine arts, as drawing and  painting, as well as for natural history, and the cultivation of  flowers and fruits, &c.    \"The lower classes in England, thus improved in morals and manners by a  better education and more humanising amusements, might be safely left  to choose their time of contracting marriage, and would then no more  make beasts of themselves by drinking fermented liquors, than do the  lower classes in the city from which I write, (Brussels) where  probably more beer (and that by no means weak) is drank than in any  town of similar size in England, every street being crowded with  _cabarets_ (public-houses,) and these in the evening almost always  filled. But how filled? Not with rioters and noisy drunkards, but with  parties at separate tables, often consisting of a man, his wife and  children, all sipping their pot of beer poured into very small glasses  to prolong the pleasure, and the gratification of drinking seeming  less than that of the cheerful chit-chat, which is the main object of  the whole assemblage. Deep-rooted national bad habits can be  eradicated only by the spread of knowledge, which will ultimately  teach our lower classes, as it has already done the bulk of the  higher, that _moderation_ is the condition of real enjoyments, and  must be the motto even of the sensualist who aims at long-continued  indulgence.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.      \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"    SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       *       *       *      TOAST.

By J.C._        Last night I dreamt that worn away      With sickness, I was dead,    And that my carcass, cheek by jowl,      Was by a poor man's laid.      My stomach rose, methought, to see      The wretch so near me lie,    And straight his sauciness I chid,      Like corpse of quality.      Scoundrel, cried I, move farther off,      And give your betters room,    Avaunt, you scrub, and rot elsewhere,      Foh! how you stink and fume.      Scrub! quoth the saucy dog, that's well,      Pray who's more scrub than you?    Bethink you, Mr., where you are,      And do not rant it so.      Hither on equal terms all come,      Here's neither rich nor poor,    My muck's my own, and be assur'd,      That your's can be no more.           *       *       *       *       *      SONG.        Oh, yes! I always dream of her,      But never breathe her name;    Her spirit always dwells with me,      By night, by day the same!    The cheerful smile no more is mine;      I sorrow and regret;    I strive in vain to banish love,      But still I can't forget.      My friends may try to rally me,      And chase my grief away;    I smile in sadness while they laugh,      But heed not what they say.    They must not know how deep I love,      Nor win my secret yet;    And when I smile amid the scene,      'Tis not that I forget.      My lips can never break the spell;      Her name is buried here!    And yet perchance she may bedew      My coffin with a tear!    But if in climes away from her      The sun of life should set,    Her name will quiver on my lip,      When I the world forget.

Volume 13, No. 376, June (#8)"],[1,"removal is  not attended with this inconvenience: the external ear, therefore, or  something in its form to collect sound, is a necessary part of the organ.    The next division is the intermediate ear; it consists of the tympanum,  mastoid cells, and Eustachian tube. The tympanum contains four small  delicate bones, viz. the malleus, the incus, the stapes, and the os  orbiculare, joined to the incus. The intermediate ear displays an  irregular cavity, having a membrane, called the membrana tympani,  stretched across its extremity; and this cavity has a communication with  the external air, through the Eustachian tube, which leads into the fauces,  or throat. The membrane of the tympanum is intended to carry the  vibrations of the atmosphere, collected by the outward ear, to the chain  of bones which form the peculiar mechanism of the tympanum. Besides the  effect of the hard and bony parts of the ear in increasing the power of  sound, the tension of the different membranes is also a requisite: thus  various muscles are so situated as to put the membrane on the stretch,  that the sound, striking upon it, may, from its tension, similar to that  of the parchment of a drum-head, have full influence upon the sense. In  respect to its tension, the membrane of the tympanum may be also compared,  not unaptly, to the string of a violin, or musical instrument, even more  properly than to a drum; as the state of tension and relaxation in such  chords produces a variety of sound in the instrument, so, in the same  manner, circumstances, which affect the tension and relaxation of the  tympanum, vary most perceptibly its powers of action, and the customary  agency of the organ. Its four bones act mechanically, in consequence of  the power of the local muscles: they strike like the key of an instrument,  and produce a percussion on the nerves of the tympanum. Not only may the  membrane of the tympanum be partially destroyed, and hearing be preserved,  but the small bones of the tympanum have been in certain cases lost, or  have come away, from ulceration, and through a constitutional or other  cause; but in such cases it appears that the stapes was, in most instances,  left, and thus the openings of the fenestra ovata and fenestra rotunda  were preserved, which prevented the escape of sound from the labyrinth and  internal parts. With respect to the Eustachian tube, its aperture into  the throat seems indispensable to hearing; and whenever closed, from  malconfirmation or disease, deafness is the certain consequence.    The third division of the organ is the internal ear, which is called the  labyrinth; it is divided into the vestibule, three semicircular canals,  and the cochlea: the whole are incased within the petrous portion of the  temporal bone. The internal ear may be considered as the actual seat of  the organ; it consists of a nervous expansion of high sensibility, the  sentient extremities of which spread in every direction, and in the most  minute manner; inosculating with each other, and forming plexus, by which  the auricular sense is increased. Here, also, sound is collected and  retained by the mastoid cells and cochlea. To this apparatus is added the  presence of a fluid, contained in sacs and membranes; as this fluid is in  large quantities in some animals, there is no doubt it is intended as an  additional means for enforcing the impression: the known influence of  water, as a powerful medium or conductor of sound, strengthens this idea.  The internal ear of man, therefore, has all the known varieties of  apparatus, which are only partially present in other classes of the  creation; and its perfection is best judged of, by considering the variety  or form of the internal ear of other animals. The internal ear of some  animals consists of little more than a sac of fluid, on which is expanded  a small nervous pulp; according to the situation of this, whether the  creature lives in water, or is partially exposed to the air, it has an  external opening with the ear, or otherwise.--_Lecture delivered at the  Royal Institution, May 30, 1828--by J.H.

Unto my nephew, Robert Langdon,    Of whom none says he e'er has wrong done,    Though civil law he loves to hash,    I give two hundred pounds in cash.    One hundred pounds to my niece, Tuder,    (With loving eyes one Brandon view'd her,)    And to her children just among 'em,    In equal shares I freely give them.    To Charlotte Watson and Mary Lee,    If they with Lady Poulett be,    Because they round the year did dwell    In Twickenham house, and served full well,    When Lord and Lady both did stray    Over the hills and far away,    The first ten pounds, the other twenty,    And girls, I hope, that will content ye.    In seventeen hundred and sixty-nine,    This with my hand I write and sign,    The sixteenth day of fair October,    In merry mood, but sound and sober,    Past my three-score and fifteenth year,    With spirits gay, and conscience clear,    Joyous and frolicsome, though old,    And like this day, serene but cold,    To friends well wishing, and to friends most kind,    In perfect charity with all mankind.
