They will never  turn their backs, I venture to predict, or weary of their gazing so long  as he continues to display his splendid action.     (6) Or, \"by aids and signs,\" as we say.     (7) Or, \"exercising-ground.\"     (8) Or, \"and the man who knows how to manage such a creature      gracefully himself at once appears magnificent.\"    If the possessor of so rare a creature should find himself by chance in  the position of a squadron leader or a general of cavalry, he must  not confine his zeal to the development of his personal splendour,  but should study all the more to make the troop or regiment a splendid  spectacle. Supposing (in accordance with the high praise bestowed upon  the type of animal) (9) the leader is mounted on a horse which with  his high airs and frequent prancing makes but the slightest movement  forward--obviously the rest of the troop must follow at a walking  pace, and one may fairly ask where is the element of splendour in the  spectacle? But now suppose that you, sir, being at the head of the  procession, rouse your horse and take the lead at a pace neither too  fast nor yet too slow, but in a way to bring out the best qualities in  all the animals, their spirit, fire, grace of mien and bearing ripe  for action--I say, if you take the lead of them in this style, the  collective thud, the general neighing and the snorting of the horses  will combine to render not only you at the head, but your whole company  (10) down to the last man a thrilling spectacle.

Nov.\" xiv. p. 343.    One word more. Supposing a man has shown some skill in purchasing his  horses, and can rear them into strong and serviceable animals, supposing  further he can handle them in the right way, not only in the training  for war, but in exercises with a view to display, or lastly, in the  stress of actual battle, what is there to prevent such a man from making  every horse he owns of far more value in the end than when he bought  it, with the further outlook that, unless some power higher than human  interpose, (11) he will become the owner of a celebrated stable, and  himself as celebrated for his skill in horsemanship.     (11) Or, \"there is nothing, humanly speaking, to prevent such a man.\"      For the phrase see \"Mem.\" I. iii. 5; cf. \"Cyrop.\" I. vi. 18; and      for the advice, \"Econ.\" iii. 9, 10.        XII    We will now describe the manner in which a trooper destined to run the  risks of battle upon horseback should be armed. In the first place,  then, we would insist, the corselet must be made to fit the person;  since, if it fits well, its weight will be distributed over the whole  body; whereas, if too loose, the shoulders will have all the weight to  bear, while, if too tight, the corselet is no longer a defensive arm,  but a \"strait jacket.\" (1) Again, the neck, as being a vital part, (2)  ought to have, as we maintain, a covering, appended to the corselet and  close-fitting. This will serve as an ornament, and if made as it ought  to be, will conceal the rider's face--if so he chooses--up to the nose.     (1) Cf. \"Mem.\" III. x.     (2) L. Dind. cf. Hom. \"Il.\" viii. 326:    {... othi kleis apoergei aukhena te stethos te, malista de kairion  estin.}    \"Where the collar-bone fenceth off neck and breast, and where is the  most deadly spot\" (W. Leaf).    As to the helmet, the best kind, in our opinion, is one of the Boeotian  pattern, (3) on the principle again, that it covers all the parts  exposed above the breastplate without hindering vision. Another point:  the corselet should be so constructed that it does not prevent its  wearer sitting down or stooping. About the abdomen and the genitals  and parts surrounding (4) flaps should be attached in texture and in  thickness sufficient to protect (5) that region.     (3) Schneider cf. Aelian, \"V. H.\" iii. 24; Pollux, i. 149.     (4) Schneider cf. \"Anab.\" IV. vii. 15, and for {kai ta kuklo}, conj.      {kuklo}, \"the abdomen and middle should be encircled by a skirt.\"     (5) Lit. \"let there be wings of such sort, size, and number as to      protect the limbs.\"    Again, as an injury to the left hand may disable the horseman, we would  recommend the newly-invented piece of armour called the gauntlet, which  protects the shoulder, arm, and elbow, with the hand engaged in holding  the reins, being so constructed as to extend and contract; in addition  to which it covers the gap left by the corselet under the armpit. The  case is different with the right hand, which the horseman must needs  raise to discharge a javelin or strike a blow. Here, accordingly, any  part of the corselet which would hinder action out to be removed; in  place of which the corselet ought to have some extra flaps (6) at the  joints, which as the outstretched arm is raised unfold, and as the arm  descends close tight again. The arm itself, (7) it seems to us, will  better be protected by a piece like a greave stretched over it than  bound up with the corselet. Again, the part exposed when the right hand  is raised should be covered close to the corselet either with calfskin  or with metal; or else there will be a want of protection just at the  most vital point.     (6) {prosthetai}, \"moveable,\" \"false.\" For {gigglumois} L. & S. cf.      Hipp. 411. 12; Aristot. \"de An.\" iii. 10. 9 = \"ball-and-socket      joints.\"     (7) i.e. \"forearm.\"    Moreover, as any damage done to the horse will involve his rider in  extreme peril, the horse also should be clad in armour--frontlet,  breastplate, and thigh-pieces; (8) which latter may at the same time  serve as cuisses for the mounted man. Beyond all else, the horse's  belly, being the most vital and defenceless part, should be protected.  It is possible to protect it with the saddle-cloth. The saddle itself  should be of such sort and so stitched as to give the rider a firm seat,  and yet not gall the horse's back.     (8) Cf. \"Cyrop.\" VI. iv. 1; VII. i. 2.    As regards the limbs in general, both horse and rider may be looked upon  as fully armed. The only parts remaining are the shins and feet, which  of course protrude beyond the cuisses, but these also may be armed  by the addition of gaiters made of leather like that used for making  sandals. And thus you will have at once defensive armour for the shins  and stockings for the feet.    The above, with the blessing of heaven, will serve for armour of  defence. To come to weapons of offence, we recommend the sabre rather  than the straight sword, (9) since from the vantage-ground of the  horse's position the curved blade will descend with greater force than  the ordinary weapon.     (9) The {makhaira} (or {kopis}), Persian fashion, rather than the      {xephos}. \"Cyrop.\" I. ii. 13.    Again, in place of the long reed spear, which is apt to be weak and  awkward to carry, we would substitute two darts of cornel-wood; (10)  the one of which the skilful horseman can let fly, and still ply the one  reserved in all directions, forwards, backwards, (11) and obliquely; add  to that, these smaller weapons are not only stronger than the spear but  far more manageable.     (10) For these reforms, the result of the author's Asiatic experiences      perhaps, cf. \"Hell.\" III. iv. 14; \"Anab.\" I. viii. 3; \"Cyrop.\" I.      ii. 9.     (11) Reading {eis toupisthen} after Leoncl.    As regards range of discharge in shooting we are in favour of the  longest possible, as giving more time to rally (12) and transfer the  second javelin to the right hand. And here we will state shortly the  most effective method of hurling the javelin. The horseman should throw  forward his left side, while drawing back his right; then rising bodily  from the thighs, he should let fly the missile with the point slightly  upwards. The dart so discharged will carry with the greatest force and  to the farthest distance; we may add, too, with the truest aim, if at  the moment of discharge the lance be directed steadily on the object  aimed at.

He  was hardly on board the raft, when the sea water so increased the pain in  his leg, that he nearly fainted; we gave notice of his situation to the  nearest boat, we were answered that a boat would come and fetch this  officer. I do not know whether the order was given, but it is certain that  Mr. Coudin was obliged to remain on the fatal raft.    The long-boat, which we have been forced to lose sight of for a moment, in  order to give these necessary details, at length rallied; it was, as we  have stated, the last that left the frigate. The lieutenant who commanded  her, justly fearing that he should not be able to keep the sea, in a crazy  boat destitute of oars, badly rigged, and making much water, ran along-side  of the first boat, begging it to take in some men; they refused. This long  boat was to leave us some ropes to fix our mast; which an instant before  had been hauled to us, by the first boat, which we had before us: we do not  know what reason hindered it from leaving us these ropes, but it passed on,  and ran along-side the second boat, which equally refused to take any body  on board. The officer, who commanded the long-boat, seeing that they  refused to take any of his men, and falling more and more under the wind,  because his sails were badly trimmed, and the currents drove him, made up  to the third-boat, commanded by a sub-lieutenant named Maudet; this  officer, commanding a slight boat which the day before had a plank beat in,  by one of the cross pieces of the raft, (an accident which had been  remedied by covering the hole with a large piece of lead,) and being  besides heavily laden, in order to avoid the shock of the long-boat, which  might have been fatal to him, was forced to let loose the tow-rope, which  held him to the barge, and thus broke in two the line formed by the boats  before the craft, by separating himself from it with the captains boat  which was at the head: when the captain and Mr. Maudet had disengaged  themselves they hauled the wind, and then put about to come and take their  post; Mr. Maudet even hailed M. de Chaumareys, \"_Captain take your towrope  again_,\" he received for answer, _yes my friend_. Two boats were still at  their post, but before the other two were able to rejoin them, the barge  separated itself; the officer who commanded it, expressed himself as  follows respecting his thus abandoning us. \"The towrope was not let go from  my boat, but from that behind me.\" This second desertion was the forerunner  of another still more cruel; for the officer who commanded the last boat in  which was the governor, after having towed us alone, for a moment, caused  the rope to be loosened which held it to the raft. When the towropes were  let go, we were two leagues from the frigate; the breeze came from the sea,  which was as favorable as could be desired. This last tow-rope did not  break, as the governor has tried to persuade the minister of the marine,  and several persons who escaped from the raft. Walking on the terrace of a  French merchant at Senegal, in the presence of Messrs. Savigny and Coudin,  the governor explained the affair as follows: \"Some men were on the front  of the raft, at the place where the tow-rope was fixed; which they pulled  so as to draw the boat nearer to them; they had already pulled several  fathoms of it to them, but a wave coming, gave a violent shock; these men  were obliged to let go; the boats then proceeded more rapidly, till the  rope was stretched; at the moment when the boats effected this tension the  effort was such, that the rope broke.\" This manner of explaining this last  desertion is very adroit, and might easily deceive those who were not on  the spot, but it is not possible for us to accede to it, since we could  even name the person who loosened it.    Some persons belonging to the other boats have assured us, that all the  boats were coming to resume their post, when a cry of \"_we forsake them_,\"  was heard: we have this fact from many of our companions in misfortune. The  whole line was thrown into disorder, and no measures were taken to remedy  it: it is probable, that if one of the first officers had set the example,  order would have been restored; but every one was left to himself; hence  there was no concert in the little division; every one thought of escaping  from personal danger.    Let us here do justice to the courage of Mr. Clanet, pay-master of the  frigate, who was on board the governor's boat; if he had been listened to,  this tow-rope would not have been let go; every moment an officer who was  in the governor's boat cried out aloud, \"_shall I let go?_\" Mr. Clanet  opposed it, answering with firmness, \"_No no_!\" Some persons joined him,  but could obtain nothing, the tow-rope was let go: we considered it as  certain, that the commander of the other boats, on seeing the chief of the  expedition courageously devote himself, would have come and resumed their  posts: but it may be said that each individual boat was abandoned by all  the others: there was wanting, on this occasion, a man of great coolness:  and ought not this man to have been found among the chief officers?  How  shall their conduct be justified?  There are, certainly, some reasons to be  alledged. Impartial judges of events, we will describe them, not as unhappy  victims of the consequences of this desertion, but as men free from all  personal resentment, and who listen only to the voice of truth.    The raft, drawn by all the boats united, dragged them a little back; it is  true that we just had the ebb, and the currents set from shore. To be in  the open sea with undecked vessels, might well inspire some apprehensions:  but, in a few hours, the currents would change and favor us; we ought to  have waited for this moment, which would have infallibly demonstrated the  possibility of drawing us to the coast, which was not above twelve or  fifteen leagues distant: this is so true that the boats discovered the  coast, the same evening, before sunset. Perhaps they would have been forced  to forsake us the second night after our departure, if indeed more than  thirty-six hours had been required to tow us to land; for the weather was  very bad; but we should then have been very near to the coast, and it would  have been very easy to save us: at least we should have had only the  elements to accuse!--We are persuaded that a short time would have sufficed  to tow us within sight of land, for, the evening of our being deserted, the  raft was precisely in the direction which the boats had followed between  the frigates and the coast, and, at least, five leagues from the former.  The next morning, at daybreak, we could no longer see the Medusa.[A9]    At the first moment we did not really believe that we had been so cruelly  abandoned. We imagined that the boats had let loose, because they had  perceived a vessel, and hastened towards it to ask assistance. The  long-boat was pretty near us to leeward on the starboard. She lowered her  foresail half way down: her manoeuvre made us think that she was going to  take the first tow-rope: she remained so a moment, lowered her foresail  entirely, setup her main-mast, hoisted her sails, and followed the rest of  the division. Some men in this boat, seeing that the others deserted us,  threatened to fire upon them, but were stopped by Lieutenant Espiau. Many  persons have assured us that it was the intention of this officer to come  and take the tow-rope; but his crew opposed it; had he done so, he would  certainly have acted with great imprudence. His efforts would have been of  little use to us, and his devotedness would but have increased the number  of victims.[B6] As soon as this boat was gone, we had no doubt but that we  were abandoned; yet we were not fully convinced of it till the boats had  disappeared.    It was now that we had need of all our courage, which, however, forsook us  more than once: we really believed that we were sacrificed, and with one  accord, we cried that this desertion was premeditated. We all swore to  revenge ourselves if we had the good fortune to reach the shore, and there  is no doubt but that, if we could have overtaken, the next day, those who  had fled in the boats, an obstinate combat would have taken place between,  them and us.    It was then that some persons who had been marked out for the boats, deeply  regretted that they had preferred the raft, because duty and honor had  pointed out this post to them. We could mention some persons: for example,  Mr. Correard, among others, was to go in one of the boats; but twelve of  the workmen, whom we commanded, had been set down for the raft; he thought  that in his quality of commander of engineers, it was his duty not to  separate from the majority of those who had been confided to him, and who  had promised to follow him wherever the exigencies of the service might  require; from that moment his fate became inseparable from theirs, and he  exerted himself to the utmost to obtain the governor's permission to have  his men embarked in the same boat as himself; but seeing that he could  obtain nothing to ameliorate the fate of these brave men, he told the  governor that he was incapable of committing an act of baseness: that since  he would not put his workmen in the same boat with him, he begged him to  allow him to go on the raft with them, which was granted.    Several military officers imitated their example; only two of those who  were to command the troops did not think fit to place themselves upon the  raft, the equipment of which, in truth, could not inspire much confidence.    One of them, Captain Beiniere, placed himself in the long-boat with 36 of  his soldiers. We had been told that these troops had been"]]]
