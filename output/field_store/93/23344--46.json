[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"in Swift, who  \"while gazing on the stars, was betrayed by his lower parts into a  ditch!\"    The reader's time need not be wasted with the allegorical and other  mystical significations given to the poem; still less on the question  whether Beatrice is theology, or a young lady, or both; and least of all  on the discovery of the ingenious Signor Rossetti, that Dante and all  the other great old Italian writers meant nothing, either by their  mistresses or their mythology, but attacks on the court of Rome. Suffice  it, that besides all other possible meanings, Dante himself has told us  that his poem has its obvious and literal meaning; that he means a spade  by a spade, purgatory by purgatory, and truly and unaffectedly to devote  his friends to the infernal regions whenever he does so. I confess I  think it is a great pity that Guido Cavalcante did not live to read the  poem, especially the passage about his father. The understanding of  Guido, who had not the admiration for Virgil that Dante had (very likely  for reasons that have been thought sound in modern times), was in all  probability as good as that of his friend in many respects, and perhaps  more so in one or two; and modern criticism might have been saved some  of its pains of objection by the poet's contemporary.    The author did not live to publish, in any formal manner, his  extraordinary poem, probably did not intend to do so, except under those  circumstances of political triumph which he was always looking for; but  as he shewed portions of it to his friends, it was no doubt talked of  to a certain extent, and must have exasperated such of his enemies as  considered him worth their hostility. No wonder they did all they could  to keep him out of Florence. What would they have said of him, could  they have written a counter poem? What would even his friends have said  of him? for we see in what manner he has treated even those; and yet how  could he possibly know, with respect either to friends or enemies, what  passed between them and their consciences? or who was it that gave  him his right to generate the boasted distinction between an author's  feelings as a man and his assumed office as a theologian, and parade  the latter at the former's expense? His own spleen, hatred, and avowed  sentiments of vengeance, are manifest throughout the poem; and there is  this, indeed, to be said for the moral and religious inconsistencies  both of the man and his verse, that in those violent times the spirit  of Christian charity, and even the sentiment of personal shame, were so  little understood, that the author in one part of it is made to blush by  a friend for not having avenged him; and it is said to have been thought  a compliment to put a lady herself into hell, that she might be talked  of, provided it was for something not odious. An admirer of this  infernal kind of celebrity, even in later times, declared that he would  have given a sum of money (I forget to what amount) if Dante had but  done as much for one of his ancestors. It has been argued, that in all  the parties concerned in these curious ethics there is a generous love  of distinction, and a strong craving after life, action, and sympathy  of some kind or other. Granted; there are all sorts of half-good,  half-barbarous feelings in Dante's poem. Let justice be done to the  good half; but do not let us take the ferocity for wisdom and piety; or  pretend, in the complacency of our own freedom from superstition, to see  no danger of harm to the less fortunate among our fellow-creatures in  the support it receives from a man of genius. Bedlams have been filled  with such horrors; thousands, nay millions of feeble minds are suffering  by them or from them, at this minute, all over the world. Dante's best  critic, Foscolo, has said much of the heroical nature of the age in  which the poet lived; but he adds, that its mixture of knowledge and  absurdity is almost inexplicable. The truth is, that like everything  else which appears harsh and unaccountable in nature, it was an excess  of the materials for good, working in an over-active and inexperienced  manner; but knowing this, we are bound, for the sake of the good, not  to retard its improvement by ignoring existing impieties, or blind  ourselves to the perpetuating tendencies of the bigotries of great men.  Oh! had the first indoctrinators of Christian feeling, while enlisting  the \"divine Plato\" into the service of diviner charity, only kept the  latter just enough in mind to discern the beautiful difference between  the philosopher's unmalignant and improvable evil, and their own  malignant and eternal one, what a world of folly and misery they might  have saved us! But as the evil has happened, let us hope that even this  form of it has had its uses. If Dante thought it salutary to the world  to maintain a system of religious terror, the same charity which can  hope that it may once have been so, has taught us how to commence a  better. But did he, after all, or did he not, think it salutary? Did  he think so, believing the creed himself? or did he think it from an  unwilling sense of its necessity? Or, lastly, did he write only as a  mythologist, and care for nothing but the exercise of his spleen and  genius? If he had no other object than that, his conscientiousness would  be reduced to a low pitch indeed. Foscolo is of opinion he was not only  in earnest, but that he was very near taking himself for an apostle, and  would have done so had his prophecies succeeded, perhaps with success to  the pretension.[24] Thank heaven, his \"Hell\" has not embittered the mild  reading-desks of the Church of England.    If King George the Third himself, with all his arbitrary notions, and  willing religious acquiescence, could not endure the creed of St.  Athanasius with its damnatory enjoinments of the impossible, what would  have been said to the inscription over Dante's hell-gate, or the  account of Ugolino eating an archbishop, in the gentle chapels of Queen  Victoria? May those chapels have every beauty in them, and every air of  heaven, that painting and music can bestow--divine gifts, not unworthy  to be set before their Divine Bestower; but far from them be kept the  foul fiends of inhumanity and superstition!    It is certainly impossible to get at a thorough knowledge of the  opinions of Dante even in theology; and his morals, if judged according  to the received standard, are not seldom puzzling. He rarely thinks as  the popes do; sometimes not as the Church does: he is lax, for instance,  on the subject of absolution by the priest at death.[25] All you can be  sure of is, the predominance of his will, the most wonderful poetry, and  the notions he entertained of the degrees of vice and virtue. Towards  the errors of love he is inclined to be so lenient (some think because  he had indulged in them himself), that it is pretty clear he would not  have put Paulo and Francesca into hell, if their story had not been  too recent, and their death too sudden, to allow him to assume their  repentance in the teeth of the evidence required. He avails himself of  orthodox license to put \"the harlot Rahab\" into heaven (\"cette bonne  fille de Jericho,\" as Ginguene calls her); nay, he puts her into the  planet Venus, as if to compliment her on her profession; and one of her  companions there is a fair Ghibelline, sister of the tyrant Ezzelino, a  lady famous for her gallantries, of whom the poet good-naturedly says,  that she \"was overcome by her star\"--to wit, the said planet Venus; and  yet he makes her the organ of the most unfeminine triumphs over the  Guelphs. But both these ladies, it is to be understood, repented--for  they had time for repentance; their good fortune saved them. Poor  murdered Francesca had no time to repent; therefore her mischance was  her damnation! Such are the compliments theology pays to the Creator.  In fact, nothing is really punished in Dante's Catholic hell but  impenitence, deliberate or accidental. No delay of repentance, however  dangerous, hinders the most hard-hearted villain from reaching his  heaven. The best man goes to hell for ever, if he does not think he has  sinned as Dante thinks; the worst is beatified, if he agrees with him:  the only thing which every body is sure of, is some dreadful duration  of agony in purgatory--the great horror of Catholic death beds.  Protestantism may well hug itself on having escaped it. O Luther!  vast was the good you did us. O gentle Church of England! let nothing  persuade you that it is better to preach frightful and foolish ideas of  God from your pulpits, than loving-kindness to all men, and peace above  all things.    If Dante had erred only on the side of indulgence, humanity could easily  have forgiven him--for the excesses of charity are the extensions of  hope; but, unfortunately, where he is sweet-natured once, he is bitter a  hundred times. This is the impression he makes on universalists of all  creeds and parties; that is to say, on men who having run the whole  round of sympathy with their fellow-creatures, become the only final  judges of sovereign pretension. It is very well for individuals to  make a god of Dante for some encouragement of their own position or  pretension; but a god for the world at large he never was, or can be;  and I doubt if an impression to this effect was not always, from the  very dawn of our literature, the one entertained of him by the genius  of our native country, which could never long endure any kind of  unwarrantable dictation. Chaucer evidently thought him a man who would  spare no unnecessary probe to the feelings (see the close of his version  of _Ugolino_). Spenser says not a word of him, though he copied Tasso,  and eulogised Ariosto. Shakspeare would assuredly have put him into  the list of those presumptuous lookers into eternity who \"_take upon  themselves to know\" (Cymbeline_, act v. sc. 4).

She was almost glad the time of trial had come.    She said: \"How about the guns, Mr. Morgan?\"    \"If you want them collected and put away for a while,\" offered Lee  Haines, \"I'll do what I can to help you!\"    Her smile of thanks set his blood tingling. His glance lingered a  little too long, a little too gladly, and she coloured slightly.    \"Miss Cumberland,\" said Haines, \"may I introduce myself? My name is  Lee.\"    She hesitated. The manners she had learned in the Eastern school  forbade it, but her Western instinct was truer and stronger. Her hand  went out to him.    \"I'm very glad to know you, Mr. Lee.\"    \"All right, stranger,\" said Morgan, who in the meantime had been  shifting from one foot to the other and estimating the large chances  of failure in this attempt to collect the guns, \"if you're going to  help me corral the shootin' irons, let's start the roundup.\"    The girl went with them. They had no trouble in getting the weapons.  The cold blue eye of Lee Haines was a quick and effective persuasion.    When they reached Jim Silent he stared fixedly upon Haines. Then he  drew his guns slowly and presented them to his comrade, while his eyes  shifted to Kate and he said coldly: \"Lady, I hope I ain't the last one  to congratulate you!\"    She did not understand, but Haines scowled and coloured. Dan, in the  meantime, was swept into the saloon by an influx of the cowpunchers  that left only Lee Haines outside with Kate. She had detained him with  a gesture.          CHAPTER VI      LAUGHTER    \"Mr. Lee,\" she said, \"I am going to ask you to do me a favour. Will  you?\"    His smile was a sufficient answer, and it was in her character that  she made no pretext of misunderstanding it.    \"You have noticed Dan among the crowd?\" she asked, \"Whistling Dan?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I saw him do some very nice shooting.\"    \"It's about him that I want to speak to you. Mr. Lee, he knows very  little about men and their ways. He is almost a child among them. You  seem--stronger--than most of the crowd here. Will you see that if  trouble comes he is not imposed upon?\"    She flushed a little, there was such a curious yearning in the eyes of  the big man.    \"If you wish it,\" he said simply, \"I will do what I can.\"    As he walked beside her towards her horse, she turned to him abruptly.    \"You are very different from the men I have met around here,\" she  said.    \"I am glad,\" he answered.    \"Glad?\"    \"If you find me different, you will remember me, whether for better or  worse.\"    He spoke so earnestly that she grew grave. He helped her to the saddle  and she leaned a little to study him with the same gentle gravity.    \"I should like to see you again, Mr. Lee,\" she said, and then in a  little outburst, \"I should like to see you a _lot!_ Will you come to  my house sometime?\"    The directness, the sudden smile, made him flinch. His voice was a  trifle unsteady when he replied.    \"I _shall!_\" He paused and his hand met hers. \"If it is possible.\"    Her eyebrows raised a trifle.    \"Is it so hard to do?\"    \"Do not ask me to explain,\" he said, \"I am riding a long way.\"    \"Oh, a 'long-rider'!\" she laughed, \"then of course--\" She stopped  abruptly. It may have been imagination, but he seemed to start when  she spoke the phrase by which outlaws were known to each other. He was  forcing his eyes to meet hers.    He said slowly: \"I am going on a long journey. Perhaps I will come  back. If I am able to, I shall.\"    He dropped his hand from hers and she remained silent, guessing at  many things, and deeply moved, for every woman knows when a man speaks  from his soul.    \"You will not forget me?\"    \"I shall never forget you,\" she answered quietly. \"Good-bye, Mr. Lee!\"    Her hand touched his again, she wheeled, and rode away. He remained  standing with the hand she had grasped still raised. And after a  moment, as he had hoped, she turned in the saddle and waved to him.  His eyes were downward and he was smiling faintly when he re-entered  the saloon.    Silent sat at a table with his chin propped in his hand--his left  hand, of course, for that restless right hand must always be free. He  stared across the room towards Whistling Dan. The train of thoughts  which kept those ominous eyes so unmoving must be broken. He sat down  at the side of his chief.    \"What the hell?\" said the big man, \"ain't you started yet?\"    \"Look here, Jim,\" said Haines cautiously, \"I want you to lay off on  this kid, Whistling Dan. It won't meant anything to you to raise the  devil with him.\"    \"I tell you,\" answered Silent, \"it'll please me more'n anything in the  world to push that damned girl face of his into the floor.\"    \"Silent, I'm asking a personal favour of you!\"    The leader turned upon him that untamed stare. Haines set his teeth.    \"Haines,\" came the answer, \"I'll stand more from you than from any man  alive. I know you've got guts an' I know you're straight with me.  But there ain't anything can keep me from manhandlin' that kid over  there.\" He opened and shut his fingers slowly. \"I sort of yearn to get  at him!\"    Haines recognized defeat.    \"But you haven't another gun hidden on you, Jim? You won't try to  shoot him up?\"    \"No,\" said Silent. \"If I had a gun I don't know--but I haven't a gun.  My hands'll be enough!\"    All that could be done now was to get Whistling Dan out of the saloon.  That would be simple. A single word would suffice to send the timid  man helter-skelter homewards.    The large, lazy brown eyes turned up to Haines as the latter  approached.    \"Dan,\" he said, \"hit for the timbers--get on your way--there's danger  here for you!\"    To his astonishment the brown eyes did not vary a shade.    \"Danger?\" he repeated wonderingly.    \"Danger! Get up and get out if you want to save your hide!\"    \"What's the trouble?\" said Dan, and his eyes were surprised, but not  afraid.    \"The biggest man in this room is after your blood.\"    \"Is he?\" said Dan wonderingly. \"I'm sorry I don't feel like leavin',  but I'm not tired of this place yet.\"    \"Friend,\" said Haines, \"if that tall man puts his hands on you, he'll  break you across his knee like a rotten stick of wood!\"    It was too late. Silent evidently guessed that Haines was urging his  quarry to flee.    \"Hey!\" he roared, so that all heads turned towards him, \"you over  there.\"    Haines stepped back, sick at heart. He knew that it would be folly to  meet his chief hand to hand, but he thought of his pledge to Kate, and  groaned.    \"What do you want of me?\" asked Dan, for the pointed arm left no doubt  as to whom Silent intended.    \"Get up when you're spoke to\" cried Silent. \"Ain't you learned no  manners? An' git up quick!\"    Dan rose, smiling his surprise.    \"Your friend has a sort of queer way of talkin',\" he said to Haines.    \"Don't stan' there like a fool. Trot over to the bar an' git me a jolt  of red-eye. I'm dry!\" thundered Silent.    \"Sure!\" nodded Whistling Dan amiably, \"glad to!\" and he went  accordingly towards the bar.    The men about the room looked to each other with sick smiles.  There was an excuse for acquiescence, for the figure of Jim Silent  contrasted with Whistling Dan was like an oak compared with a sapling.  Nevertheless such bland cowardice as Dan was showing made their flesh  creep. He asked at the bar for the whisky, and Morgan spoke as Dan  filled a glass nearly to the brim.    \"Dan,\" he whispered rapidly, \"I got a gun behind the bar. Say the word  an' I'll take the chance of pullin' it on that big skunk. Then you  make a dive for the door. Maybe I can keep him back till you get on  Satan.\"    \"Why should I beat it?\" queried Dan, astonished. \"I'm jest beginnin'  to get interested in your place. That tall feller is sure a queer one,  ain't he?\"    With the same calm and wide-eyed smile of inquiry he turned away,  taking the glass of liquor, and left Morgan to stare after him with a  face pale with amazement, while he whispered over and over to himself:  \"Well, I'll be damned! Well, I'll be damned!\"    Dan placed the liquor before Silent. The latter sat gnawing his lips.    \"What in hell do you mean?\" he said. \"Did you only bring one glass?  Are you too damn good to drink with me? Then drink by yourself, you  white-livered coyote!\"    He dashed the glass of whisky into Dan's face. Half blinded by the  stinging liquor, the latter fell back a pace, sputtering, and wiping  his eyes. Not a man in the room stirred. The same sick look was on  each face. But the red devil broke loose in Silent's heart when he saw  Dan cringe. He followed the thrown glass with his clenched fist. Dan  stood perfectly still and watched the blow coming. His eyes were wide  and wondering, like those of a child. The iron-hard hand struck him  full on the mouth, fairly lifted him from his feet, and flung him  against the wall with such violence that he recoiled again and fell  forward onto his knees. Silent was making beast noises in his throat  and preparing to rush on the half-prostrate figure. He stopped short.    Dan was laughing. At least that chuckling murmur was near to a laugh.  Yet there was no mirth in it. It had that touch of the maniacal in it  which freezes the blood. Silent halted in the midst of his rush, with  his hands poised for the next blow. His mouth fell agape with an odd  expression of horror as Dan stared up at him. That hideous chuckling  continued. The sound defied definition. And from the shadow in which  Dan was crouched his brown eyes blazed, changed, and filled with  yellow fires.    \"God!\" whispered Silent, and at that instant the ominous crouched  animal with the yellow eyes, the nameless thing which had been  Whistling Dan a moment before, sprang up and forward with a leap like  that of a panther.    Morgan stood behind the bar with a livid face and a fixed smile. His  fingers still stiffly clutched the whisky"]]]
