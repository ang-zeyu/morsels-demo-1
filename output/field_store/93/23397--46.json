We subjoin a few extracts of      popular interest.]    _Caloric, or the matter of Heat._    Heat is admitted by the philosophers of the present day to be the  principle concerned in repulsion; and heat and cold are known to  produce expansion and contraction in all bodies. Heat is, therefore,  the antagonist of cohesion. Chemists have thought it necessary to make  a distinction between the senses in which the word heat may be taken.  In its usual acceptation, it merely means the effect excited on the  organs of sensation by a hot body. But as this must be produced by  a power in the hot body independent of sensation, that power is what  chemists understand by the word _heat_: and to distinguish between  the effect and its cause, the term _caloric_ has been substituted.  The introduction of this term appears altogether unnecessary, when  the sense in which the word _heat_ should be understood is explained.  Caloric means the _cause_ of the _sensation_ heat: and there seems no  reason to fear that the perception of heat by the organs of sensation  can ever be misunderstood to be the agent in chemical phenomena.    _Omniscience displayed in the constitution of the Atmosphere._    In the constitution of the atmosphere we have ample scope to admire  the design and execution of a structure calculated, with such wondrous  precision, to fulfil its purposes. Were the atmosphere to consist  wholly of oxygen; and the different kinds of objects which compose,  and are found upon, the globe, to remain what they are; the world  would run through its stages of decay, renovation, and final  destruction, in a rapid cycle. Combustion, once excited, would proceed  with ungovernable violence; the globe, during its short existence,  would be in a continual conflagration, until its ashes would be its  only remains: animals would live with hundred-fold intensity, and  terminate their mortal career in a few hours. On the other hand,  were the atmosphere wholly composed of azote, life could never have  existed, whether animal or vegetable, and the objects of the Creator  in forming this world would not be fulfilled. But the atmosphere is a  wholesome mixture of these two formidable elements, each neutralizing  the other's baneful influence. The life of animals quietly runs  through its allotted space; and the current of nature flows within  prescribed limits, manageably and moderately.    _Tartaric Acid._    Every one knows, that when a large quantity of the juice of grapes is  left to spontaneous fermentation, the result is wine. When wine has  been kept some time to depurate in wooden vessels, it deposits, on the  side of the vessel, a hard crust of dark coloured matter, the taste  of which is sour. This matter is impure; but, when purified by various  crystallizations, it becomes perfectly white and crystalline; and  then it is known in commerce by the name of _cream of tartar_. The  etymology of the singular name, tartar, is uncertain: it is derived  from _tartaros_, as some say, because it occasions pains equal to  those endured in the infernal regions; and, as others say, merely  because this substance deposits itself in the inferior parts of the  cask. Tartaric acid may be obtained from cream of tartar by a  process analogous to that given for obtaining citric acid. It has an  exceedingly acid taste: it dissolves readily in water, and is soluble  in alcohol. Its crystals are of a very irregular shape. In 100 parts,  by weight, there are 12 of water; the remaining 88 parts are the pure  anhydrous acid, composed of 32-39 parts of carbon, 52-97 of oxygen,  and 2-64 of hydrogen. This acid exists abundantly in other fruits, but  especially in the tamarind; in the grape it exists along with citric,  malic, and an acid called _vinic_, which resembles tartaric acid  in many respects, but differs from it in others, and concerning the  nature of which almost nothing is known: these four constitute the  agreeable tartness of the juice of that fruit.    _Oxalic Acid_.    The plant called sorrel is valued for its acidulous taste. This  acidity is owing to the presence of a peculiar acid, which may  be separated from the juice, and from the potash with which it is  combined, by a process analagous to that described for the preparation  of citric acid. It has obtained the name of _oxalic acid_, from  the generic name of the plant, _oxalis acetosella_. This acid forms  readily into regular crystals, of which one half the weight is water,  the other half being pure acid. It is a remarkable circumstance in  its constitution, that it contains no hydrogen, and that it consists  merely of carbon and oxygen--there being twice as much oxygen as  there is carbon. So that it differs from carbonic acid merely in the  relative quantities of its ingredients. Oxalic acid can be prepared by  an artificial process, with great ease, from sugar, and six times its  weight of nitric acid,--the former affording the carbon necessary to  its formation, and the latter the oxygen. It is only necessary to  heat the nitric acid on the sugar; the sugar dissolves, and there is  a violent effervescence, which must be moderated by immersion in  cold water: when the mixture cools, crystals of oxalic acid form in  abundance, which may be purified by a second crystallization.    Oxalic acid is an active poison; many persons have fallen victims to  its virulence, by having swallowed it in mistake for Epsom salt, which  it resembles in appearance. In all probability, this would not prove  to be the only vegetable acid capable of acting as a poison. Chalk  finely powdered, and diffused in water, is the proper antidote to the  poison of oxalic acid.        [The chapter on Combustion contains some new facts; and that      on the Atomic Theory is more attractive than might have been      expected.]           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER           *       *       *       *       *    _The Plain Truth._--Sir John Trevor, cousin to Lord Chancellor  Jefferies, was an able man, but as corrupt as he was able. He  was twice Speaker of the House of Commons, and officially had the  mortification to put the question to the house, \"whether himself ought  to be expelled for bribery.\" The answer was \"Yes.\"    _Freaks of Royalty._--James I. in a capricious mood, threatened  the Lord Mayor with removing the seat of royalty, the meetings of  parliament, &c. from the capital. \"Your Majesty at least,\" replied the  Mayor, \"will be graciously pleased to leave us the River Thames.\"    _The Original Strand._--In the reign of Edward III. the Strand was an  open highway. A solitary house occasionally occurred; but in 1353,  the ruggedness of the highway was such, that Edward appointed a tax on  wool, leather, &c. for its improvement.    On the laying the first stone of the church of St. Martin's in  the Fields, the king (George I.) gave one hundred guineas to be  distributed among the workmen.    _A swampy Kingdom._--In the reign of Charles II. at the east end of  St. James's Park, there was a swampy retreat for the ducks, thence  denominated Duck Island, which, by Charles was erected into a  government, and a salary annexed to the office, in favour of the  celebrated French writer, M. de St. Evremond, who was the first and  last governor.    The gold embroidery of the chair of state in Carlton Palace is stated  to have cost 500_l_.    The horse rode by the Champion in the coronation of George the Third  was the same that bore George the Second at the memorable battle of  Dettingen.    _Political Criticism._--The following proof of political prejudice  may not be known:--\"John Milton was one whose natural parts might  deservedly give him a place amongst the principal of our English  poets, having written two heroic poems and a tragedy, viz:--Paradise  Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes; _but his fame is gone  out like a candle in a snuff_; and his memory will always stink,  which might have ever lived in honourable repute, had he not been  a notorious traitor, and most impiously and villanously belied that  blessed martyr, King Charles I.\"--_Lives of the most famous English  Poets, &c. 1687, by Wm. Winstanley._    _A Pastor._--The Rev. Andrew Marvell, A.M. father of the patriot,  was born at Mildred, in Cambridgeshire, in 1586. He was a student of  Emanuel College in that University, where he took his degree of Master  of Arts in 1608. Afterwards he was elected master of the grammar  school at Hull, and in 1624, lecturer of Trinity Church in that town.  \"He was a most excellent preacher,\" says Fuller, \"who, like a good  husband, never broached what he had new-brewed, but preached what he  had studied some competent time before: insomuch that he was wont to  say that he would cross the common proverb, which called 'Saturday the  working day, and Monday the holiday, of preachers.'\"    _Dryden's Mc Flecnoe_.--W. Newcastle has the following excellent lines  in reference to Dryden's poem:--      \"_Flecnoe_, thy characters are so full of wit    And fancy, as each word is throng'd with it.    Each line's a _volume_, and who reads would swear    _Whole libraries_ were in each character.    Nor arrows in a quiver stuck, nor yet    Lights in the starry skies are thicker set,    Nor quills upon the armed porcupine,    Than _wit and fancy_ in this work of thine.\"      SIR WALTER SCOTT.      The long-expected death of this good and great man took place at  Abbotsford on Friday, September 21. Our seventh volume contains  a Portrait and Memoir of his life to the year 1826; and it is our  intention to prepare for our ensuing number, a brief memoir continued  to his last days, with a wood-cut portrait from the latest painting.  About twelve months since, Sir Walter wrote, with almost prophetic  pen, the following passage in the introduction to his last published  work: \"The gentle reader is acquainted, that these are, in all  probability, the last tales which it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11894"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#8)"],[1," But Bhima I had found not. By good luck it  is that slayer of my brother, whom I had been seeking so long, hath come  before me! It was he who in the disguise of a Brahmana slew my dear  brother Vaka in the _Vetrakiya_ forest by virtue of his science. He hath  truly no strength of arms! It is also this one of wicked soul who  formerly slew my dear friend Hidimva, living in this forest and ravished  his sister! And that fool hath now come into this deep forest of mine,  when the night is half spent, even at the time when we wander about!  Today I will wreak my long-cherished vengeance upon him, and I will  today gratify (the manes of) Vaka with his blood in plenty! By slaying  this enemy of the Rakshasas, I shall today be freed from the debt I owe  to my friend and my brother, and thereby attain supreme happiness! If  Bhimasena was let free formerly by Vaka, today, I will devour him in thy  sight, O Yudhishthira! And even as Agastya ate up and digested the  mighty Asura (Vatapi) I will eat up and digest this Bhima!\"'    \"Vidura continued, 'Thus addressed by the Rakshasa, the virtuous  Yudhishthira, steadfast in his pledges, said, \"It can never be so,\"--and  in anger rebuked the Rakshasa. The mighty-armed Bhima then tore up in  haste a tree of the length of ten _Vyasas_ and stripped it of its  leaves. And in the space of a moment the ever-victorious Arjuna stringed  his bow _Gandiva_ possessing the force of the thunderbolt. And, O  Bharata, making Jishnu desist, Bhima approached that Rakshasa still  roaring like the clouds and said unto him, \"_Stay! Stay!_\" And thus  addressing the cannibal, and tightening the cloth around his waist, and  rubbing his palms, and biting his nether lip with his teeth, and armed  with the tree, the powerful Bhima rushed towards the foe. And like unto  Maghavat hurling his thunderbolt, Bhima made that tree, resembling the  mace of Yama himself descend with force on the head of the cannibal. The  Rakshasa, however, was seen to remain unmoved at that blow, and wavered  not in the conflict. On the other hand, he hurled his lighted brand,  flaming like lightning, at Bhima. But that foremost of warriors turned  it off with his left foot in such a way that it went back towards the  Rakshasa. Then the fierce Kirmira on his part, all on a sudden uprooting  a tree darted to the encounter like unto the mace-bearing Yama himself.  And that fight, so destructive of the trees, looked like the encounter  in days of yore between the brothers Vali and Sugriva for the possession  of the same woman. And the trees struck at the heads of the combatants,  were broken into splinters, like lotus-stalks thrown on the temples of  infuriate elephants. And in that great forest, innumerable trees,  crushed like unto reeds, lay scattered as rags. That encounter with  trees between that foremost of Rakshasas and that best of men, O thou  bull of the Bharata race, lasted but for a moment. Then taking up a  crag, the angry Rakshasa hurled it at Bhima standing before him, but the  latter wavered not. Then like unto Rahu going to devour the sun  dispersing his rays with extended arms, the Rakshasa with out-stretched  arms darted towards Bhima, who had remained firm under the blow  inflicted with the crag. And tugging at and grappling with each other in  diverse ways they appeared like two infuriate bulls struggling with each  other. Or like unto two mighty tigers armed with teeth and claws, the  encounter between them waxed fierce and hard. And remembering their  (late) disgrace at the hands of Duryodhana, and proud of the strength of  his arms, and conscious also of Krishna looking at him, Vrikodara began  to swell in vigour. And fired with anger, Bhima seized the Rakshasa with  his arms, as one elephant in rut seizeth another. And the powerful  Rakshasa also in his turn seized his adversary, but Bhimasena that  foremost of all men endued with strength, threw the cannibal down with  violence. The sounds that in consequence of those mighty combatants  pressing each other's hands, were frightful and resembled the sounds of  splintering bamboos. And hurling the Rakshasa down, seized him by the  waist, and began to whirl him about, even as fierce hurricane shaketh a  tree. And thus seized by the mighty Bhima, the fatigued Rakshasa, became  faint, and trembling all over, he still pressed the (Pandava) with all  his strength. And finding him fatigued, Vrikodara, twined his own arms  round the foe, even as one bindeth a beast with cord. And the monster  thereupon began to roar frightfully, as a trumpet out of order. And the  mighty Vrikodara for a long while whirled the Rakshasa till the latter  appeared to be insensible, and began to move convulsively. And finding  the Rakshasa exhausted, the son of Pandu without loss of time took him  up in his arms, and slew him like a beast. And placing his knee on the  waist of that wretch of Rakshasa, _Vrikodara_ began to press the neck of  the foe with his hands. Then Bhima, dragging along the earth the bruised  body of the Rakshasa with the eye-lids about to close, said, \"O sinful  wretch, thou wilt no more have to wipe away the tears of Hidimva or  Vaka, for thou too art about to go to the mansions of Yama!\" And saying  this, that foremost of men, his heart filled with wrath, beholding the  Rakshasa destitute of clothing and ornaments, and insensible, and  undergoing convulsions, left him dead. And after that Rakshasa of hue  like the clouds had been slain, the son of that best of kings (Pandu)  praised Bhima for his many qualities, and placing Krishna in their  front, set out for the Dwaita woods.'    \"Vidura said, 'It was thus, O lord of men, that Kirmira was slain in  combat by Bhima, in obedience, O Kaurava, to the commands of  Yudhishthira the just! And having rid the forest of its pest, the  victorious Yudhishthira the just, began to live in that dwelling of  theirs, with Draupadi. And those bulls of the Bharata race comforting  Draupadi began to cheerfully extol Bhima with glad hearts. And after the  Rakshasa had been slain, borne down by the might of Bhima's arms, those  heroes entered into the peaceful forest freed from its annoyance.  Passing through the great forest I saw lying the body of the wicked and  fearless Rakshasa slain by Bhima's might. And, O Bharata, there I heard  of this achievement of Bhima from those Brahmanas who have assembled  round the Pandavas.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing the account of the slaughter in combat  of Kirmira, that foremost of Rakshasas, the king sighed in sorrow and  became absorbed in thought.\"      SECTION XII    (Arjunabhigamana Parva)    Vaisampayana said, \"Hearing that the Pandavas had been banished, the  Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas went to those heroes residing in  affliction in the great forest. And the consanguinous relatives of  Panchala, and Dhrishtaketu the king of Chedi, and those celebrated and  powerful brothers the Kaikeyas, their hearts fired with wrath, went to  the forest to see the sons of Pritha. And reproaching the sons of  Dhritarashtra, they said, 'What should we do?' And those bulls of the  Kshatriya race, with Vasudeva at their head, sat themselves down round  Yudhishthira the just. And respectfully saluting that foremost of the  Kurus, Kesava mournfully said, 'The earth shall drink the blood of  Duryodhana and Karna, of Dussasana and the wicked Sakuni! Slaying these  in battle and defeating their followers along with their royal allies,  will we all install Yudhishthira the just on the throne! The wicked  deserve to be slain! Verily, this is eternal morality.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And when on account of the wrongs of Pritha's  sons, Janardana had thus got into a passion, and seemed bent upon  consuming all created things, Arjuna exerted himself to pacify him. And  beholding Kesava angry, Phalguna began to recite the feats achieved in  his former lives by that soul of all things, himself immeasurable, the  eternal one, of infinite energy, the lord of _Prajapati_ himself, the  supreme ruler of the worlds, Vishnu of profound wisdom!'    \"Arjuna said, 'In days of old, thou, O Krishna, hadst wandered on the  Gandhamadana mountains for ten thousand years as a _Muni_ having his  home where evening fell! Living upon water alone, thou hadst, in days of  old, O Krishna, also dwelt for full eleven thousand years by the lake of  Pushkara! And, O slayer of Madhu, with arms upraised and standing on one  leg, thou hadst passed a hundred years on the high hills of Vadari,[16]  living all the while upon air! And leaving aside thy upper garment, with  body emaciated and looking like a bundle of veins, thou hadst lived on  the banks of the Saraswati, employed in thy sacrifice extending for  twelve years! And, O Krishna of mighty energy, in observance of thy vow  thou hadst stood on one leg for the length of a thousand years of the  celestials, on the plains of _Prabhasa_ which it behoveth the virtuous  to visit! Vyasa hath told me that thou art the cause of the creation and  its course! And, O Kesava, the lord of _Kshetra_,[17] thou art the mover  of all minds, and the beginning and end of all things! All asceticism  resteth in thee, and thou too art the embodiment of all sacrifices, and  the eternal one! Slaying the Asura Naraka, offspring of the Earth-first  begotten, thou hadst obtained his ear-rings, and performed, O Krishna,  the first horse-sacrifice (offering up that Asura as the sacrificial  horse)! And, O bull of all the worlds, having performed that feat, thou  hast become victorious over all! Thou hadst slain all the _Daityas_ and  _Danavas_ mustered in battle, and giving the lord of _Sachi_ (Indra) the  sovereignty of the universe, thou hast, O Kesava of mighty arms, taken  thy birth among men! O slayer of all foes, having floated on the  primordial waters, thou subsequently becamest _Hari_,[18] and _Brahma_  and _Surya_ and _Dharma_, and _Dhatri_ and _Yama_ and _Anala_ and  _Vasu_,"]]]
