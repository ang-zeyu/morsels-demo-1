Know ye, therefore, that I am going to write  about what I never saw myself, nor experienced, nor so much as heard  from anybody else, and, what is more, of such things as neither are,  nor ever can be.  I give my readers warning, therefore, not to  believe me.                        *          *          *          *    Once upon a time, {77} then, I set sail from the Pillars of  Hercules, and getting into the Western Ocean, set off with a  favourable wind; the cause of my peregrination was no more than a  certain impatience of mind and thirst after novelty, with a desire  of knowing where the sea ended, and what kind of men inhabited the  several shores of it; for this purpose I laid in a large stock of  provisions, and as much water as I thought necessary, taking along  with me fifty companions of the same mind as myself.  I prepared  withal, a number of arms, with a skilful pilot, whom we hired at a  considerable expense, and made our ship (for it was a pinnace), as  tight as we could in case of a long and dangerous voyage.    We sailed on with a prosperous gale for a day and a night, but being  still in sight of land, did not make any great way; the next day,  however, at sun-rising, the wind springing up, the waves ran high,  it grew dark, and we could not unfurl a sail; we gave ourselves up  to the winds and waves, and were tossed about in a storm, which  raged with great fury for threescore and nineteen days, but on the  eightieth the sun shone bright, and we saw not far from us an  island, high and woody, with the sea round it quite calm and placid,  for the storm was over:  we landed, got out, and happy to escape  from our troubles, laid ourselves down on the ground for some time,  after which we arose, and choosing out thirty of our company to take  care of the vessel, I remained on shore with the other twenty, in  order to take a view of the interior part of the island.    About three stadia from the sea, as we passed through a wood, we  found a pillar of brass, with a Greek inscription on it, the  characters almost effaced; we could make out however these words,  \"thus far came Hercules and Bacchus:\" near it were the marks of two  footsteps on a rock, one of them measured about an acre, the other  something less; the smaller one appeared to me to be that of  Bacchus, the larger that of Hercules; we paid our adorations to the  deities and proceeded.  We had not got far before we met with a  river, which seemed exactly to resemble wine, particularly that of  Chios; {79} it was of a vast extent, and in many places navigable;  this circumstance induced us to give more credit to the inscription  on the pillar, when we perceived such visible marks of Bacchus's  presence here.  As I had a mind to know whence this river sprung, I  went back to the place from which it seemed to arise, but could not  trace the spring; I found, however, several large vines full of  grapes, at the root of every one the wine flowed in great abundance,  and from them I suppose the river was collected.  We saw a great  quantity of fish in it which were extremely like wine, both in taste  and colour, and after we had taken and eaten a good many of them we  found ourselves intoxicated; and when we cut them up, observed that  they were full of grape stones; it occurred to us afterwards that we  should have mixed them with some water fish, as by themselves they  tasted rather too strong of the wine.    We passed the river in a part of it which was fordable, and a little  farther on met with a most wonderful species of vine, the bottoms of  them that touched the earth were green and thick, and all the upper  part most beautiful women, with the limbs perfect from the waist,  only that from the tops of the fingers branches sprung out full of  grapes, just as Daphne is represented as turned into a tree when  Apollo laid hold on her; on the head, likewise, instead of hair they  had leaves and tendrils; when we came up to them they addressed us,  some in the Lydian tongue, some in the Indian, but most of them in  Greek; they would not suffer us to taste their grapes, but when  anybody attempted it, cried out as if they were hurt.    We left them and returned to our companions in the ship.  We then  took our casks, filled some of them with water, and some with wine  from the river, slept one night on shore, and the next morning set  sail, the wind being very moderate.  About noon, the island being  now out of sight, on a sudden a most violent whirlwind arose, and  carried the ship above three thousand stadia, lifting it up above  the water, from whence it did not let us down again into the seas  but kept us suspended {81a} in mid air, in this manner we hung for  seven days and nights, and on the eighth beheld a large tract of  land, like an island, {81b} round, shining, and remarkably full of  light; we got on shore, and found on examination that it was  cultivated and full of inhabitants, though we could not then see any  of them.  As night came on other islands appeared, some large,  others small, and of a fiery colour; there was also below these  another land with seas, woods, mountains, and cities in it, and this  we took to be our native country:  as we were advancing forwards, we  were seized on a sudden by the Hippogypi, {82a} for so it seems they  were called by the inhabitants; these Hippogypi are men carried upon  vultures, which they ride as we do horses.  These vultures have each  three heads, and are immensely large; you may judge of their size  when I tell you that one of their feathers is bigger than the mast  of a ship.  The Hippogypi have orders, it seems, to fly round the  kingdom, and if they find any stranger, to bring him to the king:  they took us therefore, and carried us before him.  As soon as he  saw us, he guessed by our garb what we were.  \"You are Grecians,\"  said he, \"are you not?\"  We told him we were.  \"And how,\" added he,  \"got ye hither through the air?\"  We told him everything that had  happened to us; and he, in return, related to us his own history,  and informed us, that he also was a man, that his name was Endymion,  {82b} that he had been taken away from our earth in his sleep, and  brought to this place where he reigned as sovereign.  That spot,  {83a} he told us, which now looked like a moon to us, was the earth.  He desired us withal not to make ourselves uneasy, for that we  should soon have everything we wanted.  \"If I succeed,\" says he, \"in  the war which I am now engaged in against the inhabitants of the  sun, you will be very happy here.\"  We asked him then what enemies  he had, and what the quarrel was about?  \"Phaeton,\" he replied, \"who  is king of the sun {83b} (for that is inhabited as well as the  moon), has been at war with us for some time past.  The foundation  of it was this:  I had formerly an intention of sending some of the  poorest of my subjects to establish a colony in Lucifer, which was  uninhabited:  but Phaeton, out of envy, put a stop to it, by  opposing me in the mid-way with his Hippomyrmices; {84} we were  overcome and desisted, our forces at that time being unequal to  theirs.  I have now, however, resolved to renew the war and fix my  colony; if you have a mind, you shall accompany us in the  expedition; I will furnish you everyone with a royal vulture and  other accoutrements; we shall set out to-morrow.\"  \"With all my  heart,\" said I, \"whenever you please.\"  We stayed, however, and  supped with him; and rising early the next day, proceeded with the  army, when the spies gave us notice that the enemy was approaching.  The army consisted of a hundred thousand, besides the scouts and  engineers, together with the auxiliaries, amongst whom were eighty  thousand Hippogypi, and twenty thousand who were mounted on the  Lachanopteri; {85a} these are very large birds, whose feathers are  of a kind of herb, and whose wings look like lettuces.  Next to  these stood the Cinchroboli, {85b} and the Schorodomachi. {85c}  Our  allies from the north were three thousand Psyllotoxotae {85d} and  five thousand Anemodromi; {85e} the former take their names from the  fleas which they ride upon, every flea being as big as twelve  elephants; the latter are foot-soldiers, and are carried about in  the air without wings, in this manner:  they have large gowns  hanging down to their feet, these they tuck up and spread in a form  of a sail, and the wind drives them about like so many boats:  in  the battle they generally wear targets.  It was reported that  seventy thousand Strathobalani {86a} from the stars over Cappadocia  were to be there, together with five thousand Hippogerani; {86b}  these I did not see, for they never came:  I shall not attempt,  therefore, to describe them; of these, however, most wonderful  things were related.    Such were the forces of Endymion; their arms were all alike; their  helmets were made of beans, for they have beans there of a  prodigious size and strength, and their scaly breast-plates of  lupines sewed together, for the skins of their lupines are like a  horn, and impenetrable; their shields and swords the same as our  own.    The army ranged"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#8)"],[1,"into a mutual     undertaking _not_ to impair the territorial integrity or to violate     the political sovereignty of any state. The breach of this     undertaking would be a breach of the treaty and would sever the     relations of the offending nation with all other signatories.\"    I have given these two extracts from my notes in order to show the views  that I held, at the time the American Commission was about to depart  from the United States, in regard to the character of the guaranty which  the President intended to make the central feature of the League of  Nations. In the carrying out of his scheme and in creating an  organization to give effect to the guaranty I believed that I saw as an  unavoidable consequence an exaltation of force and an overlordship of  the strong nations. Under such conditions it would be impossible to  preserve within the organization the equality of nations, a precept of  international law which was the universally recognized basis of  intercourse between nations in time of peace. This I considered most  unwise and a return to the old order, from which every one hoped that  the victory over the Central Empires had freed the world.    The views expressed in the notes quoted formed the basis for my  subsequent course of action as an American Commissioner at Paris in  relation to the League of Nations. Convinced from previous experience  that to oppose every form of guaranty by the nations assembled at Paris  would be futile in view of the President's apparent determination to  compel the adoption of that principle, I endeavored to find a form of  guaranty that would be less objectionable than the one which the  President had in mind. The commitment of the United States to any  guaranty seemed to me at least questionable, though to prevent it seemed  impossible in the circumstances. It did not seem politic to try to  persuade the President to abandon the idea altogether. I was certain  that that could not be done. If he could be induced to modify his plan  so as to avoid a direct undertaking to protect other nations from  aggression, the result would be all that could be expected. I was  guided, therefore, chiefly by expediency rather than by principle in  presenting my views to the President and in openly approving the idea of  a guaranty.    The only opportunity that I had to learn more of the President's plan  for a League before arriving in Paris was an hour's interview with him  on the U.S.S. George Washington some days after we sailed from New York.  He showed me nothing in writing, but explained in a general way his  views as to the form, purpose, and powers of a League. From this  conversation I gathered that my fears as to the proposed organization  were justified and that it was to be based on the principle of  diplomatic adjustment rather than that of judicial settlement and that  political expediency tinctured with morality was to be the standard of  determination of an international controversy rather than strict  legal justice.    In view of the President's apparent fixity of purpose it seemed unwise  to criticize the plan until I could deliver to him a substitute in  writing for the mutual guaranty which he evidently considered to be the  chief feature of the plan. I did not attempt to debate the subject with  him believing it better to submit my ideas in concrete form, as I had  learned from experience that Mr. Wilson preferred to have matters for  his decision presented in writing rather than by word of mouth.          CHAPTER IV    SUBSTITUTE ARTICLES PROPOSED      The President, Mr. Henry White, and I arrived in Paris on Saturday,  December 14, 1918, where Colonel House and General Bliss awaited us. The  days following our arrival were given over to public functions in honor  of the President and to official exchanges of calls and interviews with  the delegates of other countries who were gathering for the Peace  Conference. On the 23d, when the pressure of formal and social  engagements had in a measure lessened, I decided to present to the  President my views as to the mutual guaranty which he intended to  propose, fearing that, if there were further delay, he would become  absolutely committed to the affirmative form. I, therefore, on that day  sent him the following letter, which was marked \"Secret and Urgent\":       \"_Hotel de Crillon December 23, 1918_       \"MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:       \"The plan of guaranty proposed for the League of Nations, which has     been the subject of discussion, will find considerable objection from     other Governments because, even when the principle is agreed to,     there will be a wide divergence of views as to the terms of the     obligation. This difference of opinion will be seized upon by those,     who are openly or secretly opposed to the League, to create     controversy and discord.       \"In addition to this there will be opposition in Congress to assuming     obligations to take affirmative action along either military or     economic lines. On constitutional grounds, on its effect on the     Monroe Doctrine, on jealousy as to Congressional powers, etc., there     will be severe criticism which will materially weaken our position     with other nations, and may, in view of senatorial hostility, defeat     a treaty as to the League of Nations or at least render it impotent.       \"With these thoughts in mind and with an opposition known to exist     among certain European statesmen and already manifest in Washington,     I take the liberty of laying before you a tentative draft of articles     of guaranty which I do not believe can be successfully opposed either     at home or abroad.\"    I would interrupt the reader at this point to suggest that it might be  well to peruse the enclosures, which will be found in the succeeding  pages, in order to have a better understanding of the comments which  follow. To continue:       \"I do not see how any nation can refuse to subscribe to them. I do     not see how any question of constitutionality can be raised, as they     are based essentially on powers which are confided to the Executive.     They in no way raise a question as to the Monroe Doctrine. At the     same time I believe that the result would be as efficacious as if     there was an undertaking to take positive action against an offending     nation, which is the present cause of controversy.       \"I am so earnestly in favor of the guaranty, which is the heart of     the League of Nations, that I have endeavored to find a way to     accomplish this and to remove the objections raised which seem to me     to-day to jeopardize the whole plan.       \"I shall be glad, if you desire it, to confer with you in regard to     the enclosed paper or to receive your opinion as to the suggestions     made. In any event it is my hope that you will give the paper     consideration.       \"Faithfully yours       \"ROBERT LANSING       \"THE PRESIDENT       \"28 _Rue de Monceau_\"    It should be borne in mind in reading this letter that I had reached the  conclusion that modification rather than abandonment of the guaranty was  all that I could hope to accomplish, and that, as a matter of  expediency, it seemed wise to indicate a sympathetic attitude toward the  idea. For that reason I expressed myself as favorable to the guaranty  and termed it \"the heart of the League of Nations,\" a phrase which the  President by his subsequent use of it considered to be a proper  characterization.    The memoranda contained in the paper enclosed in the letter were as  follows:    _The Constitutional Power to provide Coercion in a Treaty_                                        \"_December_ 20, 1918       \"In the institution of a League of Nations we must bear in mind the     limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States upon the     Executive and Legislative Branches of the Government in defining     their respective powers.       \"The Constitution confers upon Congress the right to declare war.     This right, I do not believe, can be delegated and it certainly     cannot be taken away by treaty. The question arises, therefore, as to     how far a provision in an agreement as to a League of Nations, which     imposes on the United States the obligation to employ its military or     naval forces in enforcing the terms of the agreement, would be     constitutional.       \"It would seem that the utilization of forces, whether independently     or in conjunction with other nations, would in fact by being an act     of war create a state of war, which constitutionally can only be done     by a declaration of Congress. To contract by treaty to create a state     of war upon certain contingencies arising would be equally tainted     with unconstitutionality and would be null and inoperative.       \"I do not think, therefore, that, even if it were advisable, any     treaty can provide for the independent or joint use of the military     or naval forces of the United States to compel compliance with a     treaty or to make good a guaranty made in a treaty.       \"The other method of international coercion is non-intercourse,     especially commercial non-intercourse. Would a treaty provision to     employ this method be constitutional?       \"As to this my mind is less clear. The Constitution in delegating     powers to Congress includes the regulation of commerce. Does     non-intercourse fall within the idea of regulation? Could an embargo     be imposed without an act of Congress? My impression is that it could     not be done without legislation and that a treaty provision agreeing     in a certain event to impose an embargo against another nation     would be void.       \"Even if Congress was willing to delegate to the Executive for a     certain purpose its powers as to making war and regulating commerce,     I do not think that it could constitutionally do so. It is only in     the event of war that powers conferred"]]]
