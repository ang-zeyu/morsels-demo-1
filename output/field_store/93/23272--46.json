The  cultivator of a low swampy country, makes complaint of the abundance of  rain with which his fields are inundated; whilst the inhabitant of  the hill, raises his thanks for the favors he receives, solicits a  continuance of that which causes the despair of his neighbour. In this,  each is willing to have a god for himself, and asks according to his  momentary caprices, to his fluctuating wants, that the invariable  essence of things, should be continually changed in his favour.    From this it must be obvious, that man every moment asks a _miracle_ to  be wrought in his support. It is not, therefore, at all surprising that  he displayed such ready credulity, that he adopted with such facility  the relation of the marvellous deeds which were universally announced to  him as the acts of the power, or the effects of the benevolence, of  the various gods which presided over the nations of the earth: these  wonderful tales, which were offered to his acceptance, as the most  indubitable proofs of the empire of these gods over nature, which man  always found deaf to his entreaties, were readily accredited by him; in  the expectation, that if he could gain them over to his interest, this  nature, which he found so sullen, so little disposed to lend herself to  his views, would then be controuled in his own favor.    By a necessary consequence of these ideas, nature was despoiled of all  power; she was contemplated only as a passive instrument, who acted at  the will, under the influence of the numerous, all-powerful agents to  whom the various superstitions had rendered her subordinate. It was thus  for want of contemplating nature under her true point of view, that man  has mistaken her entirely, that he believed her incapable of producing  any thing by herself; that he ascribed the honor of all those  productions, whether advantageous or disadvantageous to the human  species, to fictitious powers, whom he always clothed with his own  peculiar dispositions, only he aggrandized their force. In short, it  was upon the ruins of nature, that man erected the imaginary colossus of  superstition, that he reared the _altars of a Jupiter, the temples of an  Apollo_.    If the ignorance of nature gave birth to such a variety of gods, the  knowledge of this nature is calculated to destroy them. As soon as man  becomes enlightened, his powers augment, his resources increase in a  ratio with his knowledge; the sciences, the protecting arts, industrious  application, furnish him assistance; experience encourages his progress,  truth procures for him the means of resisting the efforts of many  causes, which cease to alarm him as soon as he obtains a correct  knowledge of them. In a word, his terrors dissipate in proportion as his  mind becomes enlightened, because his trepidation is ever commensurate  with his ignorance, and furnishes this great lesson, that _man,  instructed by truth, ceases to be superstitious_.            CHAP. II.    _Of Mythology, and Theology_.      The elements of nature were, as we have shewn, the first divinities  of man; he has generally commenced with adoring material beings; each  individual, as we have already said, as may be still seen in savage  nations, made to himself a particular god, of some physical object,  which he supposed to be the cause of those events, in which he was  himself interested; he never wandered to seek out of visible nature,  the source either of what happened to himself, or of those phenomena to  which he was a witness. As he every where saw only material effects, he  attributed them to causes of the same genus; incapable in his infancy  of those profound reveries, of those subtle speculations, which are  the fruit of time, the result of leisure, he did not imagine any cause  distinguished from the objects that met his sight, nor of any essence  totally different from every thing he beheld.    The observation of nature was the first study of those who had leisure  to meditate: they could not avoid being struck with the phenomena of the  visible world. The rising and setting of the sun, the periodical return  of the seasons, the variations of the atmosphere, the fertility and  sterility of the earth, the advantages of irrigation, the damage caused  by floods, the useful effects of fire, the terrible consequences  of conflagration, were proper and suitable objects to occupy their  thoughts. It was natural for them to believe that those beings they saw  move of themselves, acted by their own peculiar energies; according as  their influence over the inhabitants of the earth was either favorable  or otherwise, they concluded them to have either the power to injure  them, or the disposition to confer benefits. Those who first acquired  the knowledge of gaining an ascendancy over man, then savage, wandering,  unpolished, or dispersed in woods, with but little attachment to the  soil, of which he had not yet learned to reap the advantage, were always  more practised observers--individuals more instructed in the ways of  nature, than the people, or rather the scattered hordes, whom they found  ignorant and destitute of experience: their superior knowledge placed  them in a capacity to render these services--to discover to them useful  inventions, which attracted the confidence of the unhappy beings to  whom they came to offer an assisting hand; savages who were naked,  half famished, exposed to the injuries of the weather, obnoxious to the  attacks of ferocious beasts, dispersed in caverns, scattered in forests,  occupied with hunting, painfully labouring to procure themselves a very  precarious subsistence, had not sufficient leisure to make discoveries  calculated to facilitate their labour, or to render it less incessant.  These discoveries are generally the fruit of society: isolated beings,  detached families, hardly ever make any discoveries--scarcely ever think  of making any. The savage is a being who lives in a perpetual state of  infancy, who never reaches maturity unless some one comes to draw him  out of his misery. At first repulsive, unsociable, intractable, he by  degrees familiarizes himself with those who render him service; once  gained by their kindness, he readily lends them his confidence; in the  end he goes the length of sacrificing to them his liberty.    It was commonly from the bosom of civilized nations that have issued  those personages who have carried sociability, agriculture, art, laws,  gods, superstition, forms of worship, to those families or hordes as yet  scattered; who united them either to the body of some other nations,  or formed them into new nations, of which they themselves became the  leaders, sometimes the king, frequently the high priest, and often their  god. These softened their manners--gathered them together--taught  them to reap the advantages of their own powers--to render each other  reciprocal assistance--to satisfy their wants with greater facility. In  thus rendering their existence more comfortable, thus augmenting  their happiness, they attracted their love; obtained their veneration,  acquired the right of prescribing opinions to them, made them adopt  such as they had either invented themselves, or else drawn up in the  civilized countries from whence they came. History points out to us the  most famous legislators as men, who, enriched with useful knowledge they  had gleaned in the bosom of polished nations, carried to savages without  industry, needing assistance, those arts, of which, until then, these  rude people were ignorant: such were the Bacchus's, the Orpheus's, the  Triptolemus's, the Numa's, the Zamolixis's; in short, all those who  first gave to nations their gods--their worship--the rudiments of  agriculture, of science, of superstition, of jurisprudence, of religion,  &c.    It will perhaps be enquired, If those nations which at the present day  we see assembled, were all originally dispersed? We reply, that this  dispersion may have been produced at various times, by those terrible  revolutions, of which it has before been remarked our globe has more  than once been the theatre; in times so remote, that history has not  been able to transmit us the detail. Perhaps the approach of more than  one comet may have produced on our earth several universal ravages,  which have at each time annihilated the greater portion of the human  species.    These hypotheses will unquestionably appear bold to those who have not  sufficiently meditated on nature, but to the philosophic enquirer they  are by no means inconsistent. There may not only have been one general  deluge, but even a great number since the existence of our planet; this  globe itself may have been a new production in nature; it may not always  have occupied the place it does at present. Whatever idea may be adopted  on this subject, if it is very certain that, independent of those  exterior causes, which are competent to totally change its face, as the  impulse of a comet may do, this globe contains within itself, a cause  adequate to alter it entirely, since, besides the diurnal and sensible  motion of the earth, it has one extremely slow, almost imperceptible, by  which every thing must eventually be changed in it: this is the motion  from whence depends the _precession_ of the _equinoctial points_,  observed by _Hipparchus_ and other mathematicians, now well understood  by astronomers; by this motion, the earth must at the end of several  thousand years change totally: this motion will at length cause  the ocean to occupy that space which at present forms the lands or  continents. From this it will be obvious that our globe, as well as all  the beings in nature, has a continual disposition to change.

Bearing to-day, 272 degrees, so as to round the point of range, which  seems to have a little mallee in the gullies on this side, and some trees  on the west side. Started at 8.30 a.m., and at four miles ascended the  highest point of the range. The view to the north-east is over an immense  stony plain with broken hills in the distance. To the north is also the  plain, with table-hills in the far distance. To the north-west is the  termination of the range running north-east and south-west, distant about  ten miles; about half-way between is a gum creek running to north-east.  To the west is the same range, and a number of conical hills between.  Changed our bearing to 220 degrees in order to break through the range.  This range is very stony, composed of a hard milky-white flint stone, and  white and yellow chalky substance, with a gradual descent on the other  side to the south, which is the finest salt-bush country that I have  seen, with a great quantity of grass upon it. The grey mare has been very  bad; her belly was very much swollen, but this morning she seemed better.  Towards afternoon, however, she fagged very much, which caused me to stop  so soon. I am almost afraid that I shall lose her. I shall see how she is  in the morning, and, if she is no better, I will endeavour to get her on  to some permanent water or creek running to the south. I think we have  now made the dip of the country to the south, but the mirage is so  powerful that little bushes appear like great gum-trees, which makes it  very difficult to judge what is before us; it is almost as bad as  travelling in the dark. I never saw it so bright nor so continuous as it  is now; one would think that the whole country was under water. Camped  without water. No timber as yet on this side of the range, except a few  bushes in the creek. A good deal of rain has fallen here lately, and the  vegetation is looking fresh.    Monday, 12th July, Large Salt-Bush and Grass Plain. The mare seems a  little better this morning, and I shall be able to make a short journey.  There was a very heavy white frost during the night, and it was bitterly  cold. Not a hill to be seen either to the south-west or west--nothing but  plain. Left our camp at 8.30 a.m. on a bearing of 220 degrees; at two  miles and a half changed to 112 degrees for three miles to a small creek  running south with plenty of feed and water. We found our horses very  much done up this morning; they could scarcely travel over the stones,  which caused me to alter my course to the eastward, where I found the  travelling generally better. All the horses are now so lame that I shall  require to rest them before I can proceed. They will not walk above two  miles an hour among the stones. The stony plain seems to continue a long  way to the south-west, but the country being undulating and the mirage so  strong, I cannot say precisely. I intend to see where this creek will  lead me to, for I cannot face the stones again. Our distance to-day, five  miles and a half.    Tuesday, 13th July, Mulga Creek. Went to the highest point on the stony  range east of us, but could only see a very short distance. There are a  number of creeks on the eastern side running into this one. The range is  low and very stony, composed of flints and pebbles of all colours. No  timber.    Wednesday, 14th July, Same Place. During the night it became very cloudy,  and I was afraid we were going to have more rain, but it has ended in a  light shower, and cleared off this morning. I shall follow down the creek  and see what it leads to. The grey mare still seems very bad, and I must  make short journeys until she gets a little better. Started at 8.30 a.m.,  bearing 180 degrees for eight miles to Large Mulga Creek, thence 192  degrees for four miles. The country to-day is good on both sides of the  creek, a good salt-bush country with plenty of grass, but rather stony.  The gum trees are becoming a little larger on the creek, which at present  is formed into a great many channels. The timber consists of mulga and  dwarf gum, with saplings. There is plenty of water in the creek at  present, from the late rain, but I see nothing to indicate its becoming  permanent. Distance to-day, twelve miles.    Thursday, 15th July, Mulga and Gum Creek. Left the camp at 9 a.m. on a  bearing of 190 degrees for two miles, thence 230 degrees for one mile and  a half, thence 250 degrees for four miles and a half, thence 286 degrees  for two miles, thence 290 degrees for one mile, thence 270 degrees for  five miles, thence 320 degrees for one mile, to camp at some mallee. The  country on both sides of the creek is good, but subject to be flooded;  the width of the plain is about fifteen miles, bounded on the south side  by bare stony rises, and on the north by scrubby rises. The creek spreads  itself all over the plain, which seems to be very extensive. It has been  excessively cold to-day: wind from the west. Distance to-day, seventeen  miles.    Friday, 16th July, Large Plain, Mulga and Gum Creek. Left the camp at 9  a.m., on a bearing of 270 degrees for nine miles. The first six miles was  a continuation of the creek and plain; it then turned to the north-west  and the sand hills commenced. At nine miles we had a good view of the  surrounding country, from the east to the north-west. To the west we  could see the range that we crossed on the 11th instant trending away to  the north-west as far as the eye could reach, apparently a sandy and  scrubby country with small patches of open ground intervening. There also  appeared to be a gum creek, about five miles west of this point. Seeing  there was no hope for anything to the west for a long distance, I changed  my course to the south on a bearing of 190 degrees to cross the stony  rise, keeping on the sand hills for the benefit of the horses' feet. At  five miles found that the sandy country swept round the stony rise, the  country still having the appearance of scrub and sand hills all round. I  altered my course to south-east to 132 degrees for fourteen miles; on  this course we have ridden over a scrubby plain of a light sandy soil,  most beautifully grassed but dry, the young feed not having sprung. We  have not seen a drop of water on the surface; the ground evidently  absorbs all that falls; the scrub is principally the mulga and hakea  bushes and acacia, with a few other small bushes, but very little salt  bush. Camped to-night without water. The grey mare appears to be getting  round again; it seems to have been an affection of the chest, and has now  fallen down into the left knee, which has become very much swollen, but  it seems to have relieved her chest; she now feeds as well as ever.  Distance to-day, twenty-eight miles.    Saturday, 17th July, Scrub and Sandy Plain without Water. Started at 8.10  a.m. on the same course, 132 degrees. At two miles and a half, rain  water; at seven miles crossed a stunted gum creek running towards the  south-west; at twenty-five miles came upon a little rain water. Camped.  The plain still continues with very low rises at intervals; the scrub is  much thicker and the greater part of it dead, which makes it very  difficult to travel through. The grass is not so plentiful, and it is  more sandy. The creek that we crossed at seven miles was running; it had  salt tea-tree on its banks, and seems likely to have some permanent water  either above or below. I did not examine it, because, the surrounding  country being so sandy and scrubby, it will be of little use. Distance  to-day, twenty-five miles.    Sunday, 18th July, Dense Scrubby Plain. Rain Water. Left at 9.15 a.m. on  the same bearing, 132 degrees. We saw some native worleys, and the tracks  of a number of natives having passed this place a day or two ago, going  to the south-west. Distance to-day, twenty miles. Had to halt early in  consequence of grey mare being done up and unable to proceed. The first  part of the day's journey the scrub became more open and splendidly  grassed, the latter part was fearfully thick, it is composed of mulga,  dead and alive, and a few hakea and other bushes, with salt bush and  plenty of grass of two or three different sorts. We have a view of rising  ground a little to the north of our line, about from fifteen to twenty  miles distant. To-morrow I shall alter my course to strike the highest  point; it is a range, and seems to be wooded. I suppose it is the same  range that we crossed on the 11th instant. It is very cloudy, and seems  as if it will rain. Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Monday, 19th July, Dense Scrubby Plain. Started at 9.15 a.m. on a bearing  of 120 degrees to the highest point of the range. A slight shower fell  early this morning; it still looks very cloudy. We could only accomplish  ten miles to-day in consequence of the grey mare being unable to proceed  farther; if I can get her on to permanent water I shall leave her; she  only keeps me back, and endangers the other horses. I shall be very sorry  to do so, for she is a great favourite. We are now camped at a place  where there are five or six small watercourses; if we can find water I  shall give her until to-morrow to rest. The country that we have come  over to-day is most splendidly grassed, of a red light sandy soil, but  good; the mulga bushes in some places grow thick, and a great many are  very tall. Forster caught an opossum--the first that we have seen; we  intend making a dinner from him to-day. This is the first game we have  been able to secure, except two small ducks we had at the beginning of  our journey. We have found water a little way down the valley, which I  think will become a large creek further to the south-west. We are again  in the country of the kangaroos. Distance to-day, ten miles.    Tuesday, 20th July, Grassy Valley. We had another shower this morning. I  must try and"]]]
