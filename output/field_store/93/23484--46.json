Modern scholars  regard her as a goddess akin to Ops, Acca Larentia and Dea Dia; or  as the goddess of the new year and the returning sun (according to  Mommsen, _ab angerendo_= [Greek: apo tou anapheresthai. ton haelion).]  Her festival, called Divalia or Angeronalia, was celebrated on the  21st of December. The priests offered sacrifice in the temple of  Volupia, the goddess of pleasure, in which stood a statue of Angerona,  with a finger on her mouth, which was bound and closed (Macrobius  i. 10; Pliny, _Nat. Hist._ iii. 9; Varro, _L. L._ vi. 23). She was  worshipped as Ancharia at Faesulae, where an altar belonging to her  has been recently discovered. (See FAESULAE.)        ANGERS, a city of western France, capital of the department of  Maine-et-Loire, 191 m. S.W. of Paris by the Western railway to Nantes.  Pop. (1906) 73,585. It occupies rising ground on both banks of the  Maine, which are united by three bridges. The surrounding district is  famous for its flourishing nurseries and market gardens. Pierced  with wide, straight streets, well provided with public gardens, and  surrounded by ample, tree-lined boulevards, beyond which lie new  suburbs, Angers is one of the pleasantest towns in France. Of its  numerous medieval buildings the most important is the cathedral of  St. Maurice, dating in the main from the 12th and 13th centuries.  Between the two flanking towers of the west facade, the spires of  which are of the 16th century, rises a central tower of the same  period. The most prominent feature of the facade is the series of  eight warriors carved on the base of this tower. The vaulting of the  nave takes the form of a series of cupolas, and that of the choir and  transept is similar. The chief treasures of the church are its rich  stained glass (12th, 13th and 15th centuries) and valuable tapestry  (14th to 18th centuries). The bishop's palace which adjoins the  cathedral contains a fine synodal hall of the 12th century. Of the  other churches of Angers, the principal are St. Serge, an abbey-church  of the 12th and 15th centuries, and La Trinite (12th century). The  prefecture occupies the buildings of the famous abbey of St. Aubin; in  its courtyard are elaborately sculptured arcades of the 11th and 12th  centuries, from which period dates the tower, the only survival of the  splendid abbey-church. Ruins of the old churches of Toussaint (13th  century) and Notre-Dame du Ronceray (11th century) are also to be  seen. The castle of Angers, an imposing building girt with towers and  a moat, dates from the 13th century and is now used as an armoury.  The ancient hospital of St. Jean (12th century) is occupied by an  archaeological museum; and the Logis Barrault, a mansion built about  1500, contains the public library, the municipal museum, which has  a large collection of pictures and sculptures, and the Musee David,  containing works by the famous sculptor David d'Angers, who was a  native of the town. One of his masterpieces, a bronze statue of Rene  of Anjou, stands close by the castle. The Hotel de Pince or d'Anjou  (1523-1530) is the finest of the stone mansions of Angers; there are  also many curious wooden houses of the 15th and 16th centuries. The  palais de justice, the Catholic institute, a fine theatre, and  a hospital with 1500 beds are the more remarkable of the modern  buildings of the town. Angers is the seat of a bishopric, dating  from the 3rd century, a prefecture, a court of appeal and a court of  assizes. It has a tribunal of first instance, a tribunal of commerce,  a board of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce, a branch of  the Bank of France and several learned societies. Its educational  institutions include ecclesiastical seminaries, a lycee, a preparatory  school of medicine and pharmacy, a university with free faculties  (_facultes libres_) of theology, law, letters and science, a higher  school of agriculture, training colleges, a school of arts and  handicrafts and a school of fine art. The prosperity of the town  is largely due to the great slate-quarries of the vicinity, but the  distillation of liqueurs from fruit, cable, rope and thread-making,  and the manufacture of boots and shoes, umbrellas and parasols are  leading industries. The weaving of sail-cloth and woollen and other  fabrics, machine construction, wire-drawing, and manufacture of  sparkling wines and preserved fruits are also carried on. The chief  articles of commerce, besides slate and manufactured goods, are hemp,  early vegetables, fruit, flowers and live-stock.    [v.02 p.0009]    Angers, capital of the Gallic tribe of the Andecavi, was under the  Romans called Juliomagus. During the 9th century it became the seat of  the counts of Anjou (_q.v._). It suffered severely from the invasions  of the Northmen in 845 and the succeeding years, and of the English  in the 12th and 15th centuries; the Huguenots took it in 1585, and the  Vendean royalists were repulsed near it in 1793. Till the Revolution,  Angers was the seat of a celebrated university founded in the 14th  century.    See L.M. Thorode, _Notice de la ville d'Angers_ (Angers, 1897).        ANGERSTEIN, JOHN JULIUS (1735-1822), London merchant, and patron of  the fine arts, was born at St. Petersburg and settled in London about  1749. His collection of paintings, consisting of about forty of  the most exquisite specimens of the art, purchased by the British  government, on his death, formed the nucleus of the National Gallery.        ANGILBERT (d. 814), Frankish Latin poet, and minister of Charlemagne,  was of noble Frankish parentage, and educated at the palace school  under Alcuin. As the friend and adviser of the emperor's son, Pippin,  he assisted for a while in the government of Italy, and was later  sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794 and 796.  Although he was the father of two children by Charlemagne's daughter,  Bertha, one of them named Nithard, we have no authentic account of  his marriage, and from 790 he was abbot of St. Riquier, where his  brilliant rule gained for him later the renown of a saint. Angilbert,  however, was little like the true medieval saint; his poems reveal  rather the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the  closest intimacy with the imperial family. He accompanied Charlemagne  to Rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814.  Angilbert was the Homer of the emperor's literary circle, and was  the probable author of an epic, of which the fragment which has been  preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between  Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from Virgil, Ovid, Lucan and  Fortunatus, composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius,  and exhibits a true poetic gift. Of the shorter poems, besides the  greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the Avars  (796), an epistle to David (Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a  delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house  surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The  reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name  occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his  salutation.    Angilbert's poems have been published by E. Dummler in the _Monumenta  Germaniae Historica_. For criticisms of this edition see Traube in  Roederer's _Schriften fuer germanische Philologie_ (1888). See also A.  Molinier, _Les Sources de l'histoire de France._        ANGINA PECTORIS (Latin for \"pain of the chest\"), a term applied to a  violent paroxysm of pain, arising almost invariably in connexion  with disease of the coronary arteries, a lesion causing progressive  degeneration of the heart muscle (see HEART: _Disease_). An attack of  angina pectoris usually comes on with a sudden seizure of pain, felt  at first over the region of the heart, but radiating through the chest  in various directions, and frequently extending down the left arm.  A feeling of constriction and of suffocation accompanies the pain,  although there is seldom actual difficulty in breathing. When the  attack comes on, as it often does, in the course of some bodily  exertion, the sufferer is at once brought to rest, and during the  continuance of the paroxysm experiences the most intense agony. The  countenance becomes pale, the surface of the body cold, the pulse  feeble, and death appears to be imminent, when suddenly the attack  subsides and complete relief is obtained. The duration of a paroxysm  rarely exceeds two or three minutes, but it may last for a longer  period. The attacks are apt to recur on slight exertion, and even in  aggravated cases without any such exciting cause. Occasionally the  first seizure proves fatal; but more commonly death takes place as the  result of repeated attacks. Angina pectoris is extremely rare under  middle life, and is much more common in males than in females. It  must always be regarded as a disorder of a very serious nature. In the  treatment of the paroxysm, nitrite of amyl has now replaced all other  remedies. It can be carried by the patient in the form of nitrite  of amyl pearls, each pearl containing the dose prescribed by the  physician. Kept in this way the drug does not lose strength. As soon  as the pain begins the patient crushes a pearl in his handkerchief  and holds it to his mouth and nose. The relief given in this way is  marvellous and usually takes place within a very few seconds. In the  rare cases where this drug does not relieve, hypodermic injections  of morphia are used. But on account of the well-known dangers of this  drug, it should only be administered by a medical man. To prevent  recurrence of the attacks something may be done by scrupulous  attention to the general health, and by the avoidance of mental and  physical strain.

Young folkses  frolicked, sung songs, and visited from cabin to cabin. When dey got  behind wid de field wuk, sometimes slaves wuked atter dinner Saddays,  but dat warn't often. But, Oh, dem Sadday nights! Dat was when slaves  got together and danced. George, he blowed de quills, and he sho could  blow grand dance music on 'em. Dem Niggers would jus' dance down. Dere  warn't no foolishment 'lowed atter 10:00 o'clock no night. Sundays dey  went to church and visited 'round, but folks didn't spend as much time  gaddin' 'bout lak dey does now days.    \"Christmas Day! Oh, what a time us Niggers did have dat day! Marse  Lordnorth and Marse Alec give us evvything you could name to eat: cake  of all kinds, fresh meat, lightbread, turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese,  and all kinds of wild game. Dere was allus plenty of pecans, apples, and  dried peaches too at Christmas. Marse Alec had some trees what had fruit  dat looked lak bananas on 'em, but I done forgot what was de name of dem  trees. Marse Alec would call de grown folkses to de big house early in  de mornin' and pass 'round a big pewter pitcher full of whiskey, den he  would put a little whiskey in dat same pitcher and fill it wid sweetened  water and give dat to us chillun. Us called dat 'toddy' or 'dram'. Marse  Alex allus had plenty of good whiskey, 'cause Uncle Willis made it up  for him and it was made jus' right. De night atter Christmas Day us  pulled syrup candy, drunk more liquor, and danced. Us had a big time for  a whole week and den on New Year's Day us done a little wuk jus' to  start de year right and us feasted dat day on fresh meat, plenty of  cake, and whiskey. Dere was allus a big pile of ash-roasted 'taters on  hand to go wid dat good old baked meat. Us allus tried to raise enough  'taters to last all through de winter 'cause Niggers sho does love dem  sweet 'taters. No Mam, us never knowed nothin' 'bout Santa Claus 'til  atter de war.    \"No Mam, dere warn't no special cornshuckin's and cotton pickin's on  Marse Alec's place, but of course dey did quilt in de winter 'cause dere  had to be lots of quiltin' done for all dem slaves to have plenty of  warm kivver, and you knows, Lady, 'omens can quilt better if dey gits a  passel of 'em together to do it. Marse Alec and Marse Lordnorth never  'lowed dere slaves to mix up wid other folkses business much.    \"Oh Lord! Us never played no games in slavery times, 'cept jus' to run  around in a ring and pat our hands. I never sung no songs 'cause I  warn't no singer, and don't talk 'bout no Raw Head and Bloody Bones or  nothin' lak dat. Dey used to skeer us chillun so bad 'bout dem sort of  things dat us used to lay in bed at night a-shakin' lak us was havin'  chills. I've seed plenty of ha'nts right here in Athens. Not long atter  I had left Crawfordville and moved to Athens, I had been in bed jus' a  little while one night, and was jus' dozin' off to sleep when I woke up  and sot right spang up in bed. I seed a white man, dressed in white,  standin' before me. I sho didn't say nothin' to him for I was too  skeered. De very last time I went to a dance, somepin got atter me and  skeered me so my hair riz up 'til I couldn't git my hat on my haid, and  dat cyored me of gwine to dances. I ain't never been to no more sich  doin's.    \"Old Marster was powerful good to his Niggers when dey got sick. He had  'em seed atter soon as it was 'ported to him dat dey was ailin'. Yessum,  dere warn't nothin' short 'bout our good Marsters, 'deed dere warn't!  Grandpa Stafford had a sore laig and Marse Lordnorth looked atter him  and had Uncle Jim dress dat pore old sore laig evvy day. Slaves didn't  git sick as often as Niggers does now days. Mammy Mary had all sorts of  teas made up for us, 'cordin' to whatever ailment us had. Boneset tea  was for colds. De fust thing dey allus done for sore throat was give us  tea made of red oak bark wid alum. Scurvy grass tea cleant us out in the  springtime, and dey made us wear little sacks of assfiddy (asafetida)  'round our necks to keep off lots of sorts of miseries. Some folkses  hung de left hind foot of a mole on a string 'round deir babies necks to  make 'em teethe easier. I never done nothin' lak dat to my babies 'cause  I never believed in no such foolishment. Some babies is jus' natchelly  gwine to teethe easier dan others anyhow.    \"I 'members jus' as good as if it was yesterday what Mammy Mary said  when she told us de fust news of freedom. 'You all is free now,' she  said. 'You don't none of you belong to Mister Lordnorth nor Mister Alec  no more, but I does hope you will all stay on wid 'em, 'cause dey will  allus be jus' as good to you as dey has done been in de past.' Me, I  warn't even studyin' nothin' 'bout leavin' Marse Alec, but Sarah Ann and  Aunt Mary, dey threwed down deir hoes and jus' whooped and hollered  'cause dey was so glad. When dem Yankees come to our place Mammy Mary  axed 'em if dey warn't tired of war. 'What does you know 'bout no war?'  Dey axed her right back. 'No, us won't never git tired of doin' good.'    \"I stayed on wid my two good Marsters 'til most 3 years atter de war,  and den went to wuk for Marse Tye Elder in Crawfordville. Atter dat I  wuked for Miss Puss King, and when she left Crawfordville I come on here  to Athens and wuked for Miss Tildy Upson on Prince Avenue. Den I went to  Atlanta to wuk for Miss Ruth Evage (probably Elliott). Miss Ruth was a  niece of Abraham Lincoln's. Her father was President Lincoln's brother  and he was a Methodist preacher what lived in Mailpack, New York. I went  evvywhar wid Miss Ruth. When me and Miss Ruth was in Philadelphia, I got  sick and she sont me home to Athens and I done been here wid my daughter  ever since.    \"Lawdy, Miss! I ain't never been married, but I did live wid Major Baker  18 years and us had five chillun. Dey is all daid but two. Niggers  didn't pay so much 'tention to gittin' married dem days as dey does now.  I stays here wid my gal, Ida Baker. My son lives in Cleveland, Ohio. My  fust child was borned when I warn't but 14 years old. De war ended in  April and she was borned in November of dat year. Now, Miss! I ain't  never told but one white 'oman who her Pa was, so you needn't start  axin' me nothin' 'bout dat. She had done been walkin' evvywhar 'fore she  died when she was jus' 10 months old and I'm a-tellin' you de truth  when I say she had more sense dan a heap of white chillun has when dey  is lots older dan she was. Whilst I was off in New York wid Miss Ruth,  Major, he up and got married. I reckon he's daid by now. I don't keer  nohow, atter de way he done me. I made a good livin' for Major 'til he  married again. I seed de 'oman he married once.    \"Yes Mam,\" there was strong emphasis in this reply. \"I sho would ruther  have slavery days back if I could have my same good Marsters 'cause I  never had no hard times den lak I went through atter dey give us  freedom. I ain't never got over not bein' able to see Marse Alec no  more. I was livin' at Marse Tye Elder's when de gate fell on Marse Alec,  and he was crippled and lamed up from dat time on 'til he died. He got  to be Governor of Georgia whilst he was crippled. When he got hurt by  dat gate, smallpox was evvywhar and dey wouldn't let me go to see 'bout  him. Dat most killed me 'cause I did want to go see if dere was somepin'  I could do for him.    \"Lordy Mussy, Miss! I had a time jinin' up wid de church. I was in  Mailpack, New York, wid Miss Ruth when I had de urge to jine up. I told  Miss Ruth 'bout it and she said: 'Dere ain't no Baptist church in 10  miles of here.' 'Lord, have mussy!' I said. 'Miss Ruth, what I gwine do?  Dese is all Methodist churches up here and I jus' can't jine up wid no  Methodists.' 'Yes you can,' she snapped at me, 'cause my own Pa's  a-holdin a 'vival in dis very town and de Methodist church is de best  anyhow.' Well, I went on and jined de Reverend Lincoln's Methodist  church, but I never felt right 'bout it. Den us went to Philadelphia and  soon as I could find a Baptist church dar, I jined up wid it. Northern  churches ain't lak our southern churches 'cause de black and white  folkses all belong to de same church dar and goes to church together. On  dat account I still didn't feel lak I had jined de church. Bless your  sweet life, Honey, when I come back to de South, I was quick as I could  be to jine up wid a good old southern Baptist church. I sho didn't mean  to live outdoors, 'specially atter I dies.\" Georgia's eyes sparkled and  her flow of speech was smooth as she told of her religious experiences.  When that subject was exhausted her eyes dimmed again and her speech  became less articulate.    Georgia's reeking pipe had been laid aside for the watermelon and not  long after that was consumed the restless black fingers sought  occupation sewing gay pieces for a quilt. \"Miss, I warn't born to be  lazy, I warn't raised dat way, and I sho ain't skeered to die.    \"Good-bye, Honey,\" said Georgia, as the interviewer arose and made her  way toward the street. \"Hurry back and don't forgit to fetch me dat  purty pink dress you is a-wearin'. I don't lak white dresses and I ain't  never gwine to wear a black one nohow.\"      [TR: Return Visit]    Georgia was on the back porch washing her face and hands and quarrelling  with Ida for not having her breakfast ready at nine-thirty when the  interviewer arrived for a re-visit.    \"Come in,\" Georgia invited, \"and have a cheer. But, Miss I done told you  all I knows 'bout Marse Alec and dem deys when I lived on his  plantation. You know chillun den warn't 'lowed to hang 'round de grown  folks whar dey could hear things what was talked about.\"    About this time Ida came down from a second-floor kitchen with her  mother's breakfast. She was grumbling a little louder on each step of  the rickety stairway. \"Lord, have mussy! Ma is still a-talkin' 'bout dat  old slavery stuff, and it ain'"]]]
