Shelley wrote a poem,  _Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude_.    Cicero says he meditated killing himself that he might become the  Alastor of Augustus, whom he hated.--Plutarch, _Cicero, etc._  (\"Parallel Lives.\")    God Almighty mustered up an army of mice against the archbishop  [_Hatto_], and sent them to persecute him as his furious  Alastors.--Coryat, _Crudities_, 571.    AL'BAN (_St._) of Ver'ulam, hid his confessor, St. Am'phibal, and  changing clothes with him, suffered death in his stead. This was  during the frightful persecution of Maximia'nus Hercu'lius, general of  Diocle'tian's army in Britain, when 1000 Christians fell at Lichfield.      Alban--our proto-martyr called.    Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv. [1622].    AL'BERICK OF MORTEMAR, the same as Theodorick the hermit of Engaddi,  an exiled nobleman. He tells king Richard the history of his life,  and tries to dissuade him from sending a letter of defiance to the  archduke of Austria.--Sir W. Scott, _The Talisman_ (time, Richard I.).    _Al' berick_, the squire of prince Richard, one of the sons of Henry  II. of England.--Sir W. Scott, _The Betrothed_ (time, Henry II.).    ALBERT, commander of the _Britannia_. Brave, liberal, and just,  softened and refined by domestic ties and superior information. His  ship was dashed against the projecting verge of Cape Colonna, the most  southern point of Attica, and he perished in the sea because Rodmond  (second in command) grasped one of his legs and could not be shaken  off.      Though trained in boisterous elements, his mind    Was yet by soft humanity refined;    Each joy of wedded love at home he knew,    Abroad, confessed the father of his crew....      His genius, ever for th' event prepared,    Rose with the storm, and all its dangers shared.    Falconer, _The Shipwreck_, i. 2 (1756).    _Albert_, father of Gertrude, patriarch and judge of Wyo'ming (called  by Campbell Wy'oming). Both Albert and his daughter were shot by a  mixed force of British and Indian troops, led by one Brandt, who made  an attack on the settlement, put all the inhabitants to the sword, set  fire to the fort, and destroyed all the houses.--Campbell, _Gertrude  of Wyoming_ (1809).    _Albert_, in Goethe's romance called _The Sorrows of Werther_, is  meant for his friend Kestner. He is a young German farmer, who married  Charlotte Buff (called \"Lotte\" in the novel), with whom Goethe was in  love. Goethe represents himself under the name of Werther (_q. v._).    ALBERT OF GEI'ERSTEIN (_Count_), brother of Arnold Biederman, and  president of the \"Secret Tribunal.\" He sometimes appears as a  \"black priest of St. Paul's,\" and sometimes as the \"monk of St.  Victoire.\"--Sir W. Scott, _Anne of Geierstein_ (time, Edward IV.).    ALBERTAZ'ZO married Alda, daughter of Otho, duke of Saxony. His  sons were Ugo and Fulco. From this stem springs the Royal Family of  England.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    ALBIA'ZAR, an Arab chief, who joins the Egyptian armament against the  crusaders.    A chief in rapine, not in knighthood bred. Tasso, _Jerusalem  Delivered_, xvii. (1575).    AL'BION. In legendary history this word is variously accounted for.  One derivation is from Albion, a giant, son of Neptune, its first  discoverer, who ruled over the island for forty-four years.    Another derivation is Al'bia, eldest of the fifty daughters of  Diocle'sian king of Syria. These fifty ladies all married on the same  day, and all murdered their husbands on the wedding night. By way of  punishment, they were cast adrift in a ship, unmanned, but the wind  drove the vessel to our coast, where these Syrian damsels disembarked.  Here they lived the rest of their lives, and married with the  aborigines, \"a lawless crew of devils.\" Milton mentions this legend,  and naively adds, \"it is too absurd and unconscionably gross to be  believed.\" Its resemblance to the fifty daughters of Dan'aos is  palpable.    Drayton, in his _Polyolbion_, says that Albion came from Rome, was  \"the first martyr of the land,\" and dying for the faith's sake, left  his name to the country, where Offa subsequently reared to him \"a rich  and sumptuous shrine, with a monastery attached.\"--Song xvi.    _Albion_, king of Briton, when O'beron held his court in what is now  called \"Kensington Gardens.\" T. Tickell has a poem upon this subject.    _Albion wars with Jove's Son_. Albion, son of Neptune, wars with  Her'cules, son of Jove. Neptune, dissatisfied with the share of his  father's kingdom, awarded to him by Jupiter, aspired to dethrone  his brother, but Hercules took his father's part, and Albion was  discomfited.      Since Albion wielded arms against the son of    Jove.    M. Drayton, _Polyolbion_, iv. (1612).    ALBO'RAK, the animal brought by Gabriel to convey Mahomet to the  seventh heaven. It had the face of a man, the cheeks of a horse, the  wings of an eagle, and spoke with a human voice.    ALBUMA'ZAR, Arabian astronomer (776-885).      Chaunteclere, our cocke, must tell what is o'clocke,    By the astrologye that he hath naturally    Conceyued and caught; for he was never taught    By Albumazar, the astronomer,    Nor by Ptholomy, prince of astronomy.    J. Skelton, _Philip Sparoiv_ (time, Henry VIII.).    Alcestis or Alcestes, daughter of Pelias and wife of Admetus (_q. v_.)  On his wedding-day Admetus neglected to offer sacrifice to Diana and  was condemned to die, but Apollo induced the Fates to spare his life  if he could find a voluntary substitute. His wife offered to give her  life for his, and went away with death; but Hercules fought with Death  and restored Alcestes to her husband. This story is the subject of a  tragedy _Alcestes_, by Euripides. Milton alludes to the incident in  one of his sonnets:      Methought I saw my late espoused saint    Brought to me like Alcestes from the grave.    John Milton, Sonnet _On his deceased Wife_.    William Morris has made Alcestes the subject of one of the tales in  his _Earthly Paradise._    A variation of the story is found in Longfellow's _The Golden Legend_,  Henry of Hoheneck when dying was promised his life if a maiden could  be found who would give up her life for his. Elsie, the daughter  of Gottlieb, a tenant-farmer of the prince offered herself as a  sacrifice, and followed her lord to Sorrento to give herself up to  Lucifer; but Henry heard of it, and, moved by gratitude, saved Elsie  and made her his wife.    _Alceste_, the hero of Moliere's comedy _Le Misanthrope_. He has a  pure and noble mind that has been soured and disgusted by intercourse  with the world. Courtesy he holds to be the vice of fops, and the  manners of society mere hypocrisy. He courts Celmene, a coquette and  her treatment of his love confirms his bad opinion of mankind.    AL'CHEMIST (_The_), the last of the three great comedies of Ben Jonson  (1610). The other two are _Vol'pone_ (2 _syl_.), (1605), and _The  Silent Woman_ (1609). The object of _The Alchemist_ is to ridicule  the belief in the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. The  alchemist is \"Subtle,\" a mere quack; and \"sir Epicure Mammon\" is  the chief dupe, who supplies money, etc., for the \"transmutation of  metal.\" \"Abel Drugger\" a tobacconist, and \"Dapper\" a lawyer's  clerk, are two other dupes. \"Captain Face,\" _alias_ \"Jeremy,\" the  house-servant of \"Lovewit,\" and \"Dol Common\" are his allies. The whole  thing is blown up by the unexpected return of \"Lovewit.\"    ALCIB'ADES (5 _syl._), the Athenian general. Being banished by the  senate, he marches against the city, and the senate, being unable to  offer resistance, open the gates to him (B.C. 450-404). This incident  is introduced by Shakespeare in _Timon of Athens_.    ALCIBI'ADES' TABLES represented a god or goddess outwardly, and  a Sile'nus, or deformed piper, within. Erasmus has a \"curious  dissertation on these tables\" (_Adage_, 667, edit. R. Stephens); hence  emblematic of falsehood and dissimulation.      Whose wants virtue is compared to these    False tables wrought by Alcibiades;    Which noted well of all were found t've bin    Most fair without, but most deformed within.    Wm. Browne, _Britannia's Pastorals_, i. (1613).    ALCI'DES, a name sometimes given to Hercules as the descendent of the  hero Alcoeus through his son Amphitryon (_q. v._) The name is applied  to any valiant hero.      The Tuscan poet [_Ariosto_] doth advance    The frantic paladin of France [_Orlando Furioso_];    And those more ancient do enhance    Alcides in his fury.    M. Drayton, _Nymphidia_ (1563-1631).      Where is the great Alcides of the field,    Valiant lord Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury?    Shakespeare, 1 _Henry VI_. act. iv. sc. 7 (1589).    ALCI'NA, Carnal Pleasure personified. In Bojardo's _Orlando  Innamorato_ she is a fairy, who carries off Astolfo. In Ariosto's  _Orlando Furioso_ she is a kind of Circe, whose garden is a scene of  enchantment. Alcina enjoys her lovers for a season, and then converts  them into trees, stones, wild beasts, and so on, as her fancy  dictates.    AL'CIPHRON, or _The Minute Philosopher_, the title of a work by bishop  Berkeley, so called from the name of the chief speaker, a freethinker.  The object of this work is to expose the weakness of infidelity.    _Al'ciphron_, \"the epicurean,\" the hero of T. Moore's romance entitled  _The Epicurean_.      Like Aleiphron, we swing in air and darkness,    and know not whither the wind blows us.    --_Putnam's Magazine._    ALCME'NA (in Moliere, _Alcmene_), the wife of Amphitryon, general  of the Theban army. While her husband is absent warring against the  Telebo'ans, Jupiter assumes the form of Amphitryon; but Amphitryon  himself returns home the next day, and great confusion arises between  the false and true Amphitryon, which is augmented by Mercury, who  personates Sos'ia, the slave of Amphitryon.

At first I heard only the  deep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent surface.  The willows, for once, were motionless and silent. Then a sound began to  reach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound--something like the humming of a  distant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the darkness from the waste  of swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated at regular intervals, but  it was certainly neither the sound of a bell nor the hooting of a distant  steamer. I can liken it to nothing so much as to the sound of an immense  gong, suspended far up in the sky, repeating incessantly its muffled  metallic note, soft and musical, as it was repeatedly struck. My heart  quickened as I listened.    \"I've heard it all day,\" said my companion. \"While you slept this afternoon  it came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could never get near  enough to see--to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was overhead, and  sometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too, I could have sworn  it was not outside at all, but within myself--you know--the way a sound in  the fourth dimension is supposed to come.\"    I was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened  carefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I could  think of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too, coming  nearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I cannot say  that it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,  yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish I had  never heard it.    \"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels,\" I said determined to find an  explanation, \"or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps.\"    \"It comes off the whole swamp,\" my friend answered. \"It comes from  everywhere at once.\" He ignored my explanations. \"It comes from the willow  bushes somehow--\"    \"But now the wind has dropped,\" I objected. \"The willows can hardly make a  noise by themselves, can they?\"    His answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it, and secondly,  because I knew intuitively it was true.    \"It is because the wind has dropped we now hear it. It was drowned before.  It is the cry, I believe, of the--\"    I dashed back to my fire, warned by the sound of bubbling that the stew was  in danger, but determined at the same time to escape further conversation.  I was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of views. I dreaded,  too, that he would begin about the gods, or the elemental forces, or  something else disquieting, and I wanted to keep myself well in hand for  what might happen later. There was another night to be faced before we  escaped from this distressing place, and there was no knowing yet what it  might bring forth.    \"Come and cut up bread for the pot,\" I called to him, vigorously stirring  the appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held sanity for us both, and the  thought made me laugh.    He came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling in  its mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon the  ground-sheet at his feet.    \"Hurry up!\" I cried; \"it's boiling.\"    The Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. It was forced  laughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless.    \"There's nothing here!\" he shouted, holding his sides.    \"Bread, I mean.\"    \"It's gone. There is no bread. They've taken it!\"    I dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had contained lay  upon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.    The whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me. Then I  burst out laughing too. It was the only thing to do: and the sound of my  laughter also made me understand his. The stain of psychical pressure  caused it--this explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us; it was an  effort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary safety-valve.  And with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.    \"How criminally stupid of me!\" I cried, still determined to be consistent  and find an explanation. \"I clean forgot to buy a loaf at Pressburg. That  chattering woman put everything out of my head, and I must have left it  lying on the counter or--\"    \"The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,\" the Swede  interrupted.    Why in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought angrily.    \"There's enough for tomorrow,\" I said, stirring vigorously, \"and we can get  lots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four hours we shall be miles from  here.\"    \"I hope so--to God,\" he muttered, putting the things back into the sack,  \"unless we're claimed first as victims for the sacrifice,\" he added with a  foolish laugh. He dragged the sack into the tent, for safety's sake, I  suppose, and I heard him mumbling to himself, but so indistinctly that it  seemed quite natural for me to ignore his words.    Our meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in silence,  avoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the fire bright. Then we washed up  and prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds unoccupied with  any definite duties, the apprehension I had felt all day long became more  and more acute. It was not then active fear, I think, but the very  vagueness of its origin distressed me far more that if I had been able to  ticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I have likened to the note  of a gong became now almost incessant, and filled the stillness of the  night with a faint, continuous ringing rather than a series of distinct  notes. At one time it was behind and at another time in front of us.  Sometimes I fancied it came from the bushes on our left, and then again  from the clumps on our right. More often it hovered directly overhead like  the whirring of wings. It was really everywhere at once, behind, in front,  at our sides and over our heads, completely surrounding us. The sound  really defies description. But nothing within my knowledge is like that  ceaseless muffled humming rising off the deserted world of swamps and  willows.    We sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minute  greater. The worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did not  know what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of preparation by way  of defense. We could anticipate nothing. My explanations made in the  sunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and wholly  unsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to us that some kind  of plain talk with my companion was inevitable, whether I liked it or not.  After all, we had to spend the night together, and to sleep in the same  tent side by side. I saw that I could not get along much longer without the  support of his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was imperative. As  long as possible, however, I postponed this little climax, and tried to  ignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he flung into the emptiness.    Some of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me,  coming as they did to corroborate much that I felt myself; corroboration,  too--which made it so much more convincing--from a totally different point  of view. He composed such curious sentences, and hurled them at me in such  an inconsequential sort of way, as though his main line of thought was  secret to himself, and these fragments were mere bits he found it  impossible to digest. He got rid of them by uttering them. Speech relieved  him. It was like being sick.    \"There are things about us, I'm sure, that make for disorder,  disintegration, destruction, our destruction,\" he said once, while the fire  blazed between us. \"We've strayed out of a safe line somewhere.\"    And, another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing much  louder than before, and directly over our heads, he said as though talking  to himself:    \"I don't think a gramophone would show any record of that. The sound  doesn't come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations reach me in another  manner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely how a  fourth dimensional sound might be supposed to make itself heard.\"    I purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little closer to the fire  and peered about me into the darkness. The clouds were massed all over the  sky, and no trace of moonlight came through. Very still, too, everything  was, so that the river and the frogs had things all their own way.    \"It has that about it,\" he went on, \"which is utterly out of common  experience. It is unknown. Only one thing describes it really; it is a  non-human sound; I mean a sound outside humanity.\"    Having rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a time,  but he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a relief to  have the thought out, and to have confined it by the limitation of words  from dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind.    The solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? The  feeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ran  incessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my soul,  as the saying is, for the \"feel\" of those Bavarian villages we had passed  through by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces; peasants drinking  beer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on the  rocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the tourists would have been  welcome.    Yet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It was infinitely  greater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim ancestral sense of  terror more profoundly disturbing than anything I had known or dreamed of.  We had \"strayed,\" as the Swede put it, into some region or some set of  conditions where the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us; where the  frontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. It was a spot held by  the dwellers in some outer space, a sort of peep-hole "]]]
