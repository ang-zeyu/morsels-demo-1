As thou heard'st,  Two champions to the succour of his spouse  He sent, who by their deeds and words might join  Again his scatter'd people.  In that clime,  Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold  The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself  New-garmented; nor from those billows far,  Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,  The sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abides  The happy Callaroga, under guard  Of the great shield, wherein the lion lies  Subjected and supreme.  And there was born  The loving million of the Christian faith,  The hollow'd wrestler, gentle to his own,  And to his enemies terrible.  So replete  His soul with lively virtue, that when first  Created, even in the mother's womb,  It prophesied.  When, at the sacred font,  The spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,  Where pledge of mutual safety was exchang'd,  The dame, who was his surety, in her sleep  Beheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him  And from his heirs to issue.  And that such  He might be construed, as indeed he was,  She was inspir'd to name him of his owner,  Whose he was wholly, and so call'd him Dominic.  And I speak of him, as the labourer,  Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be  His help-mate.  Messenger he seem'd, and friend  Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,  Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.  Many a time his nurse, at entering found  That he had ris'n in silence, and was prostrate,  As who should say, \"My errand was for this.\"  O happy father!  Felix rightly nam'd!  O favour'd mother! rightly nam'd Joanna!  If that do mean, as men interpret it.  Not for the world's sake, for which now they pore  Upon Ostiense and Taddeo's page,  But for the real manna, soon he grew  Mighty in learning, and did set himself  To go about the vineyard, that soon turns  To wan and wither'd, if not tended well:  And from the see (whose bounty to the just  And needy is gone by, not through its fault,  But his who fills it basely, he besought,  No dispensation for commuted wrong,  Nor the first vacant fortune, nor the tenth),  That to God's paupers rightly appertain,  But, 'gainst an erring and degenerate world,  Licence to fight, in favour of that seed,  From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.  Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,  Forth on his great apostleship he far'd,  Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;  And, dashing 'gainst the stocks of heresy,  Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout.  Thence many rivulets have since been turn'd,  Over the garden Catholic to lead  Their living waters, and have fed its plants.    \"If such one wheel of that two-yoked car,  Wherein the holy church defended her,  And rode triumphant through the civil broil.  Thou canst not doubt its fellow's excellence,  Which Thomas, ere my coming, hath declar'd  So courteously unto thee.  But the track,  Which its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:  That mouldy mother is where late were lees.  His family, that wont to trace his path,  Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelong  To rue the gathering in of their ill crop,  When the rejected tares in vain shall ask  Admittance to the barn.  I question not  But he, who search'd our volume, leaf by leaf,  Might still find page with this inscription on't,  'I am as I was wont.'  Yet such were not  From Acquasparta nor Casale, whence  Of those, who come to meddle with the text,  One stretches and another cramps its rule.  Bonaventura's life in me behold,  From Bagnororegio, one, who in discharge  Of my great offices still laid aside  All sinister aim.  Illuminato here,  And Agostino join me: two they were,  Among the first of those barefooted meek ones,  Who sought God's friendship in the cord: with them  Hugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,  And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining,  Nathan the prophet, Metropolitan  Chrysostom, and Anselmo, and, who deign'd  To put his hand to the first art, Donatus.  Raban is here: and at my side there shines  Calabria's abbot, Joachim, endow'd  With soul prophetic.  The bright courtesy  Of friar Thomas, and his goodly lore,  Have mov'd me to the blazon of a peer  So worthy, and with me have mov'd this throng.\"          CANTO XIII    Let him, who would conceive what now I saw,  Imagine (and retain the image firm,  As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),  Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host  Selected, that, with lively ray serene,  O'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine  The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,  Spins ever on its axle night and day,  With the bright summit of that horn which swells  Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,  T' have rang'd themselves in fashion of two signs  In heav'n, such as Ariadne made,  When death's chill seized her; and that one of them  Did compass in the other's beam; and both  In such sort whirl around, that each should tend  With opposite motion and, conceiving thus,  Of that true constellation, and the dance  Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain  As 't were the shadow; for things there as much  Surpass our usage, as the swiftest heav'n  Is swifter than the Chiana.  There was sung  No Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but  Three Persons in the Godhead, and in one  Substance that nature and the human join'd.    The song fulfill'd its measure; and to us  Those saintly lights attended, happier made  At each new minist'ring.  Then silence brake,  Amid th' accordant sons of Deity,  That luminary, in which the wondrous life  Of the meek man of God was told to me;  And thus it spake: \"One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,  And its grain safely stor'd, sweet charity  Invites me with the other to like toil.    \"Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib  Was ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste  All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'd  By the keen lance, both after and before  Such satisfaction offer'd, as outweighs  Each evil in the scale, whate'er of light  To human nature is allow'd, must all  Have by his virtue been infus'd, who form'd  Both one and other: and thou thence admir'st  In that I told thee, of beatitudes  A second, there is none, to his enclos'd  In the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyes  To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see  Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,  As centre in the round.  That which dies not,  And that which can die, are but each the beam  Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire  Engendereth loving; for that lively light,  Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'd  From him, nor from his love triune with them,  Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,  Mirror'd, as 't were in new existences,  Itself unalterable and ever one.    \"Descending hence unto the lowest powers,  Its energy so sinks, at last it makes  But brief contingencies: for so I name  Things generated, which the heav'nly orbs  Moving, with seed or without seed, produce.  Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:  And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows  Th' ideal stamp impress: so that one tree  According to his kind, hath better fruit,  And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,  Are in your talents various.  Were the wax  Molded with nice exactness, and the heav'n  In its disposing influence supreme,  The lustre of the seal should be complete:  But nature renders it imperfect ever,  Resembling thus the artist in her work,  Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.  Howe'er, if love itself dispose, and mark  The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,  There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such  The clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,  That life can teem with; such the burden fill'd  The virgin's bosom: so that I commend  Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er  Was or can be, such as in them it was.    \"Did I advance no further than this point,  'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.  But, that what now appears not, may appear  Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what  (When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd  To his requesting.  I have spoken thus,  That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd  For wisdom, to the end he might be king  Sufficient: not the number to search out  Of the celestial movers; or to know,  If necessary with contingent e'er  Have made necessity; or whether that  Be granted, that first motion is; or if  Of the mid circle can, by art, be made  Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp.    \"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,  Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,  At which the dart of my intention aims.  And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'  Thou shalt discern it only hath respect  To kings, of whom are many, and the good  Are rare.  With this distinction take my words;  And they may well consist with that which thou  Of the first human father dost believe,  And of our well-beloved.  And let this  Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make  Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,  Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.  For he among the fools is down full low,  Whose affirmation, or denial, is  Without distinction, in each case alike  Since it befalls, that in most instances  Current opinion leads to false: and then  Affection bends the judgment to her ply.    \"Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,  Since he returns not such as he set forth,  Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.  And open proofs of this unto the world  Have been afforded in Parmenides,  Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,  Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did  Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,  Who, like to scymitars, reflected back  The scripture-image, by distortion marr'd.    \"Let not the people be too swift to judge,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#8)"],[1,"'d  By strict necessity, not by delight.  She left her joyful harpings in the sky,  Who this new office to my care consign'd.  He is no robber, no dark spirit I.  But by that virtue, which empowers my step  To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,  One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,  Who to the ford may lead us, and convey  Across, him mounted on his back; for he  Is not a spirit that may walk the air.\"       Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus  To Nessus spake:  \"Return, and be their guide.  And if ye chance to cross another troop,  Command them keep aloof.\"  Onward we mov'd,  The faithful escort by our side, along  The border of the crimson-seething flood,  Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.       Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow  Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:  \"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given  To blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud  Their merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,  And Dionysius fell, who many a year  Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow  Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,  Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks  Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd  By his foul step-son.\"  To the bard rever'd  I turned me round, and thus he spake;  \"Let him  Be to thee now first leader, me but next  To him in rank.\"  Then farther on a space  The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat  Were extant from the wave; and showing us  A spirit by itself apart retir'd,  Exclaim'd:  \"He in God's bosom smote the heart,  Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames.\"       A race I next espied, who held the head,  And even all the bust above the stream.  'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.  Thus shallow more and more the blood became,  So that at last it but imbru'd the feet;  And there our passage lay athwart the foss.       \"As ever on this side the boiling wave  Thou seest diminishing,\" the Centaur said,  \"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,  It lower still and lower sinks its bed,  Till in that part it reuniting join,  Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.  There Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand  On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,  On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts  Tears ever by the seething flood unlock'd  From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,  Pazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways  With violence and war.\"  This said, he turn'd,  And quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.        CANTO XIII    ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,  We enter'd on a forest, where no track  Of steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there  The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light  The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd  And matted thick:  fruits there were none, but thorns  Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,  Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide  Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,  Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.       Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same  Who from the Strophades the Trojan band  Drove with dire boding of their future woe.  Broad are their pennons, of the human form  Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen  The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings  These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.       The kind instructor in these words began:  \"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now  I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come  Upon the horrid sand:  look therefore well  Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,  As would my speech discredit.\"  On all sides  I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see  From whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze  Fast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,  That I had thought so many voices came  From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,  And thus his speech resum'd:  \"If thou lop off  A single twig from one of those ill plants,  The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite.\"       Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,  From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,  And straight the trunk exclaim'd:  \"Why pluck'st thou me?\"  Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,  These words it added:  \"Wherefore tear'st me thus?  Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?  Men once were we, that now are rooted here.  Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been  The souls of serpents.\"  As a brand yet green,  That burning at one end from the' other sends  A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind  That forces out its way, so burst at once,  Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.       I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one  Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:  \"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd  What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,  He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.  But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,  Prompted him to this deed, which even now  Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;  That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,  In the upper world (for thither to return  Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.\"       \"That pleasant word of thine,\" the trunk replied  \"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech  Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge  A little longer, in the snare detain'd,  Count it not grievous.  I it was, who held  Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,  Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,  That besides me, into his inmost breast  Scarce any other could admittance find.  The faith I bore to my high charge was such,  It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.  The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes  From Caesar's household, common vice and pest  Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;  And to Augustus they so spread the flame,  That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.  My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought  Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,  Just as I was, unjust toward myself.  By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,  That never faith I broke to my liege lord,  Who merited such honour; and of you,  If any to the world indeed return,  Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies  Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow.\"       First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words  Were ended, then to me the bard began:  \"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,  If more thou wish to learn.\"  Whence I replied:  \"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er  Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power  Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart.\"       He thus resum'd;  \"So may he do for thee  Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet  Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,  How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;  And whether any ever from such frame  Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell.\"       Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon  Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;       Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs  The fierce soul from the body, by itself  Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf  By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,  No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance  Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,  It rises to a sapling, growing thence  A savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves  Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain  A vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come  For our own spoils, yet not so that with them  We may again be clad; for what a man  Takes from himself it is not just he have.  Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout  The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,  Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.\"       Attentive yet to listen to the trunk  We stood, expecting farther speech, when us  A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives  The wild boar and the hunt approach his place  Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs  Loud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came  Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,  That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.  \"Haste now,\" the foremost cried, \"now haste thee death!\"  The' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay  Exclaiming, \"Lano! not so bent for speed  Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field.\"  And then, for that perchance no longer breath  Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush  One group he made.  Behind them was the wood  Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,  As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.  On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,  And having rent him piecemeal bore away  The tortur'd limbs.  My guide then seiz'd my hand,  And led me to the thicket, which in vain  Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds:  \"O Giacomo  Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,\"  It cried, \"that of me thou hast made thy screen?  For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?\"       When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:  \"Say who wast thou, that at so many points  Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?\"       He answer'd: \"Oh, ye spirits:  arriv'd in time  To spy the shameful havoc, that from me  My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,  And at the foot of their sad parent-tree  Carefully lay them.  In that city' I dwelt,  Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,  Whence he for this shall cease not with his art  To work her woe:  and if there still remain'd not  On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,  Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls  Upon the ashes left by Attila,  Had labour'd without profit of their toil.  I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.\"        CANTO XIV    SOON as the charity of native land  Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves  Collected, and to him restor'd, who now  Was hoarse with utt'rance.  To the limit thence  We came, which from the third the second round  Divides, and where of justice is display'd  Contrivance horrible.  Things then first seen  Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next  A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed  Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round  Its garland on all sides, as round the wood  Spreads the sad foss."]]]
