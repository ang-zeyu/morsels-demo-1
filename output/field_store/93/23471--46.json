Perhaps Y.R.H. may accuse me of _vanity_; but  I do assure you that precious as this dedication is to my heart, and truly  proud of it as I am, this is certainly not my chief object. Three  publishers have offered to take the work,--Artaria, Steiner, and a third  whose name does not at this moment occur to me. So of the two I have named,  which is to have the variations? I await the commands of Y.R.H. on this  point. They are to be engraved at the cost of either of those publishers,  according to their own offer. The question now is whether Y.R.H. _is  satisfied with the title_. My idea is that Y.R.H. should entirely close  your eyes to the fact of the publication; when it does appear, Y.R.H. may  deem it a misfortune, _but the world will consider it the reverse_. May  Providence protect Y.R.H., and shower down the richest blessings of His  grace on Y.R.H.'s sacred head, and preserve for me your gracious regard!

I perceive that Baron Schweiger has not informed Y.R.H. of the attack I had  yesterday. I was suddenly seized with such sharp fever that I entirely lost  consciousness; a bruised foot may have contributed to bring this on. It is  therefore impossible for me to leave the house to-day. I hope, however, to  be quite recovered by to-morrow, and I request Y.R.H. to appoint the  orchestra to come to-morrow afternoon at a quarter to three o'clock, that  the musicians may appear a little earlier, and leave sufficient time to try  over the two Overtures. If Y.R.H. wishes to hear these, I shall require  four horns; the Symphonies, however, require only two. For the proper  performance of the Symphonies we must have at least four violins, four  second, four first, two double basses, two violoncellos. I beg you will be  so good as to let me know what you decide on. No pleasure can ever be  greater to me than hearing my works performed before my illustrious pupil.  May God speedily restore your health, which often causes me anxiety!

It is impossible to double the parts by eleven o'clock to-morrow, most of  the copyists having so much to write this week. I think therefore you will  perhaps appoint next Saturday for our _resurrection day_, and by that time  I expect to be entirely recovered, and better able to conduct, which would  have been rather an arduous task for me to-morrow, in spite of my  good-will. On Friday I do hope to be able to go out and inquire for Y.R.H.    [K.]      275.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    (_A Fragment._)    The day when a High Mass of mine is performed in honor of the solemnities  for Y.R.H. will be the most delightful of my life, and God will enlighten  me so that my poor abilities may contribute to the splendors of that solemn  occasion. I send you the Sonata with heartfelt gratitude; I think the  violoncello part is wanting,--at least I could not lay my hand on it at the  moment. As the work is beautifully engraved, I have taken the liberty to  add a published copy, and also a violin quintet. In addition to the two  pieces written in my hand on Y.R.H.'s name-day, there are two more; the  last a grand _Fugato_, so that it forms one great sonata,[1] which is now  shortly to appear, and has been long _in my heart_ dedicated to Y.R.H. _The  recent occurrence connected with Y.R.H.[2] is not in the slightest degree  the cause of this._ I beg you will forgive my bad writing. I implore the  Lord to bestow His richest blessings on Y.R.H., whose love of humanity is  so comprehensive,--one of the choicest of all qualities; and in this  respect Y.R.H. will always, either in a _worldly_ or _spiritual_ point of  view, be one of our brightest examples.

DEAR SIR,--    I have the honor to send you payment for the ensuing month, which begins on  the 22d Sept., and I add 10 florins in order to provide for any unforeseen  expenses, which you will please account for to me on the 12th October. The  following persons alone are to have free access to my nephew: Herr von  Bernard, Herr von Oliva, Herr von Piuss.    If any persons, exclusive of those I have named, wish to see my nephew, I  will give them a letter to you, when you will be so obliging as to admit  them; for the distance to your house is considerable, and those who go  there can only do so to oblige me, as, for example, the bandage-maker, &c.,  &c.    My nephew must never leave your house without a written permission from me.  From this you will at once plainly perceive your line of conduct towards  Carl's mother. I must impress on you the necessity of these rules  (proceeding from the magistrates and myself) being strictly enforced. You,  dear sir, are too little experienced in these circumstances, however  obvious your other merits are to me, to act on your own judgment in the  matter, as you have hitherto done. Credulity can in the present instance  only lead to embarrassment, the result of which might prove injurious to  you rather than beneficial, and this I wish to avoid for the sake of your  own credit.    I hear that my nephew requires, or at all events wishes to have, a variety  of things from me; he has only to apply to myself. Be so good as to forward  all his letters through Herr Steiner & Co., Pater Noster Gaessel, auf'm  Graben.    Your obedient    BEETHOVEN,    _Sole guardian of my nephew Carl Van Beethoven._    N.B.

The two days' festival compels us to return the same day, as Carl  must prepare with his master here for the second examination, these very  holidays enabling the tutor to devote more time to him; but I must soon  return to town on account of the certificate of Carl's birth, which costs  more time and money than I like. I at all times dislike travelling by the  _diligence_, and this one has moreover one peculiarity, that you may wish  to go on what day you please, but it always turns out to be a Friday on  which it sets off; and though a good Christian, still one Friday in the  year is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13291"],[0,"The World's Great Men of Music: Story-Lives of Master Musicians (#8)"],[1,"conditions could not last forever, and he bravely  endeavored to make the best of them. Meanwhile the training of his  voice was well advanced and when not in school he could nearly always  be found in church, listening to the organ and the singing. Not long  after, he was admitted to the choir, where his sweet young voice  joined in the church anthems. Always before his mind was a great city  where he knew he would find the most beautiful music--the music of his  dreams. That city was Vienna, but it lay far away. Josef looked down  at his ragged clothing and wondered if he would ever see that magical  city.    One morning his cousin told him there would be a procession through  the town in honor of a prominent citizen who had just passed away. A  drummer was needed and the cousin had proposed Josef. He showed the  boy how to make the strokes for a march, with the result that Josef  walked in the procession and felt quite proud of this exhibition of  his skill. The very drum he used that day is preserved in the little  church at Hamburg.    A great event occurred in Josef's prospects at the end of his second  year of school life at Hamburg. The Capellmeister, Reutter by name, of  St. Stephen's cathedral in Vienna, came to see his friend, the pastor  of Hamburg. He happened to say he was looking for a few good voices  for the choir. \"I can find you one at least,\" said the pastor; \"he is  a scholar of Frankh, the schoolmaster, and has a sweet voice.\"    Josef was sent for and the schoolmaster soon returned leading him by  the hand.    \"Well my little fellow,\" said the Capellmeister, drawing him to his  knee, \"can you make a shake?\"    \"No sir, but neither can my cousin Frankh.\"    Reutter laughed at this frankness, and then proceeded to show him how  the shake was done. Josef after a few trials was able to perform the  shake to the entire satisfaction of his teacher. After testing him on  a portion of a mass the Capellmeister was willing to take him to the  Cantorei or Choir school of St. Stephen's in Vienna. The boy's heart  gave a great leap. Vienna, the city of his dreams. And he was really  going there! He could scarcely believe in his good fortune. If he  could have known all that was to befall him there, he might not have  been so eager to go. But he was only a little eight-year-old boy, and  childhood's dreams are rosy.    Once arrived at the Cantorei, Josef plunged into his studies with  great fervor, and his progress was most rapid. He was now possessed  with a desire to compose, but had not the slightest idea how to go  about such a feat. However, he hoarded every scrap of music paper he  could find and covered it with notes. Reutter gave no encouragement to  such proceedings. One day he asked what the boy was about, and when  he heard the lad was composing a \"Salve Regina,\" for twelve voices,  he remarked it would be better to write it for two voices before  attempting it in twelve. \"And if you must try your hand at  composition,\" added Reutter more kindly, \"write variations on the  motets and vespers which are played in church.\"    As neither the Capellmeister nor any of the teachers offered to  show Josef the principles of composition, he was thrown upon his own  resources. With much self denial he scraped together enough money to  buy two books which he had seen at the second hand bookseller's and  which he had longed to possess. One was Fox's \"Gradus ad Parnassum,\"  a treatise on composition and counterpoint; the other Matheson's \"The  Complete Capellmeister.\" Happy in the possession of these books, Josef  used every moment outside of school and choir practise to study them.  He loved fun and games as well as any boy, but music always came  first. The desire to perfect himself was so strong that he often added  several hours each day to those already required, working sixteen or  eighteen hours out of the twenty-four.    And thus a number of years slipped away amid these happy surroundings.  Little Josef was now a likely lad of about fifteen years. It was  arranged that his younger brother Michael was to come to the Cantorei.  Josef looked eagerly forward to this event, planning how he would help  the little one over the beginning and show him the pleasant things  that would happen to him in the new life. But the elder brother could  not foresee the sorrow and privation in store for him. From the moment  Michael's pure young voice filled the vast spaces of the cathedral, it  was plain that Josef's singing could not compete with it. His soprano  showed signs of breaking, and gradually the principal solo parts,  which had always fallen to him, were given to the new chorister. On  a special church day, when there was more elaborate music, the \"Salve  Regina,\" which had always been given to Josef, was sung so beautifully  by the little brother, that the Emperor and Empress were delighted,  and they presented the young singer with twenty ducats.    Poor Josef! He realized that his place was virtually taken by the  brother he had welcomed so joyously only a short time before. No one  was to blame of course; it was one of those things that could not be  avoided. But what actually caused him to leave St. Stephen's was a  boyish prank played on one of the choir boys, who sat in front of  him. Taking up a new pair of shears lying near, he snipped off, in a  mischievous moment, the boy's pigtail. For this jest he was punished  and then dismissed from the school. He could hardly realize it, in his  first dazed, angry condition. Not to enjoy the busy life any more, not  to see Michael and the others and have a comfortable home and sing  in the Cathedral. How he lived after that he hardly knew. But several  miserable days went by. One rainy night a young man whom he had known  before, came upon him near the Cathedral, and was struck by his  white, pinched face. He asked where the boy was living. \"Nowhere--I am  starving,\" was the reply. Honest Franz Spangler was touched at once.    \"We can't stand here in the rain,\" he said. \"You know I haven't a  palace to offer, but you are welcome to share my poor place for one  night anyway. Then we shall see.\"    It was indeed a poor garret where the Spanglers lived, but the  cheerful fire and warm bread and milk were luxuries to the starving  lad. Best of all was it to curl up on the floor, beside the dying  embers and fall into refreshing slumber. The next morning the world  looked brighter. He had made up his mind not to try and see his  brother; he would support himself by music. He did not know just how  he was going to do this, but determined to fight for it _and never  give in_.    Spangler, deeply touched by the boy's forlorn case, offered to let  him occupy a corner of his garret until he could find work, and Josef  gratefully accepted. The boy hoped he could quickly find something to  do; but many weary months were spent in looking for employment and  in seeking to secure pupils, before there was the slightest sign  of success. Thinly clad as he was and with the vigorous appetite of  seventeen, which was scarcely ever appeased, he struggled on, hopeful  that spring would bring some sort of good cheer.    But spring came, yet no employment was in sight. His sole earnings had  been the coppers thrown to him as he stood singing in the snow covered  streets, during the long cold winter. Now it was spring, and hope rose  within him. He had been taught to have simple faith in God, and felt  sure that in some way his needs would be met.    At last the tide turned slightly. A few pupils attracted by the small  fee he charged, took lessons on the clavier; he got a few engagements  to play violin at balls and parties, while some budding composers got  him to revise their manuscripts for a small fee. All these cheering  signs of better times made Josef hopeful and grateful. One day a  special piece of good fortune came his way. A man who loved music,  at whose house he had sometimes played, sent him a hundred and fifty  florins, to be repaid without interest whenever convenient.    This sum seemed to Haydn a real fortune. He was able to leave the  Spanglers and take up a garret of his own. There was no stove in it  and winter was coming on; it was only partly light, even at midday,  but the youth was happy. For he had acquired a little worm-eaten  spinet, and he had added to his treasures the first six sonatas of  Emmanuel Bach.    On the third floor of the house which contained the garret, lived a  celebrated Italian poet, Metastasio. Haydn and the poet struck up an  acquaintance, which resulted in the musician's introduction to the  poet's favorite pupil, Marianne Martinez. Also through Metastasio,  Haydn met Nicolo Porpora, an eminent teacher of singing and  composition. About this time another avenue opened to him. It was a  fashion in Vienna to pick up a few florins by serenading prominent  persons. A manager of one of the principal theaters in Vienna, Felix  Kurz, had recently married a beautiful woman, whose loveliness was  much talked of. It occurred to Haydn to take a couple of companions  along and serenade the lady, playing some of his own music. Soon after  they had begun to play the house door opened and Kurz himself stood  there in dressing gown and slippers. \"Whose music was that you were  playing?\" he asked. \"My own,\" was the answer. \"Indeed; then just step  inside.\" The three entered, wondering. They were presented to Madame,  then were given refreshments. \"Come and see me to-morrow,\" said Kurz  when the boys left; \"I think I have some work for you.\"    Haydn called next day and learned the manager had written a libretto  of a comic opera which he called \"The Devil on two Sticks,\" and was  looking for some one to compose the music. In one place there was to  be a tempest at sea, and Haydn was asked how he would represent that.  As he had never seen the sea, he was at a loss how to express it. The  manager said he himself had never seen the ocean, but"]]]
