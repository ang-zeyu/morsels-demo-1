It seems to be supposed in some quarters that if such an  amendment were to be adopted it would involve a breach of faith with  the dissenting States, or violate some unwritten principle of local  self-government, or conflict with the historic doctrine of State  Rights.    I have no hesitancy in saying that I have for years believed and still  believe that there is a constitutional doctrine of State Rights which  cannot be safely or rightfully ignored. Many of the foremost men in  both parties share that belief. It must be admitted, however, that  this doctrine sometimes has been so perverted, misapplied and carried  to such extreme limits as seriously to prejudice many worthy and  intelligent citizens against its true merit and value. This fact makes  it all the more necessary on the part of those who would save the  doctrine from absolute repudiation to be careful when and how and to  what purpose it is invoked.    There has recently been published a book entitled \"Woman Suffrage by  Constitutional Amendment.\" The author of that book, the Hon. Henry St.  George Tucker of Virginia, was at one time a member of Congress, and  has been president of the American Bar Association. He was invited to  deliver a course of five lectures, in 1916, before the School of Law  of Yale University on the subject of \"Local Self-Government.\" In one  of the lectures woman suffrage by Federal Amendment was discussed and  the theory was advanced that the attempt to bring about the right of  suffrage by an amendment to the Constitution of the United States  was opposed to the genius of the Constitution and subversive of the  principle of local self-government. In his opinion, woman suffrage  by Federal Amendment is contrary to the rightful demarcation of the  powers of the Federal and State governments under the Constitution of  the United States.    I may remark in passing that the title of the book is liable to  mislead the public into thinking that Mr. Tucker was invited to Yale  to discuss woman suffrage, whereas the fact was that that was only an  incident in his discussion of Local Self-Government.    But is woman suffrage by Federal Amendment contrary to the genius  of the Constitution and contrary to the rightful demarcation of the  powers of the Federal Government?    In considering the question involved it is to be noticed in the first  place that a difference exists between the Articles of Confederation  and the Constitution. In the Articles of Confederation it was in the  Thirteenth Article expressly provided that no alteration should be  made in any of the Articles \"unless such alteration be agreed to in  a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by  the legislatures of every State.\" This provision was an element  of weakness and recognized as such by the men who sat in the  Constitutional Convention of 1787. As the Articles constituted a  league between independent states it was deemed necessary to make it  incapable of alteration except by unanimous consent of the states in  order to preserve to each state all of its rights.    When the convention of 1787 met to agree upon a Constitution to submit  to the States one of the questions they had to consider was whether it  should be made capable of amendment. They agreed that it was the  part of wisdom to provide that the States might modify the system of  government the Constitution established when in the progress of time  to do so seemed desirable. Mr. Madison accordingly proposed what with  some modifications became the Fifth Article.    The Congress was given power by that Article to propose amendments by  a vote of two-thirds of both Houses and amendments so proposed were to  become valid to all intents and purposes as parts of the Constitution  when ratified by three-fourths of the several States. This is not  the only method by which the Constitution may be amended. For it is  provided that the States may themselves propose amendments through a  convention called by two-thirds of the States, and it is also  provided that proposed amendments may be submitted for ratification  to conventions in the several States instead of to the Legislatures of  the States if Congress so directs.    When the Constitution of a State is amended care must be taken to see  to it that the amendment proposed does not involve a violation of the  Constitution of the United States. For a constitution adopted by the  people of a State in so far as it violates the Constitution of the  United States is void, for exactly the same reason that an Act passed  by a State Legislature is void if it is contrary to some provision  in the Constitution of the United States. This is so because the  Constitution of the United States in the Sixth Article directs that  \"This Constitution ... shall be the supreme law of the land; and  the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the  Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"    But any amendment with a single exception, which is proposed by  Congress, no matter what it may be, if it has received the two-thirds  vote of both Houses and has been ratified by the Legislatures of  three-fourths of the States, or of three-fourths of the conventions in  the several States, according as Congress has submitted it in the one  way or the other, is valid irrespective of any provision that can be  found in any State Constitution or law. The one exception to which  reference has been made is that no change can be made which would  deprive a State of its right to equal representation in the Senate.  As it is, the Senate is composed of two Senators from each state. New  York and Nevada, the one with a population of 9,113,614, and the other  with a population of 81,875 are entitled to equal representation in  that body, and that equality of representation cannot be destroyed by  any amendment not assented to by all the States. The reason is that  the Constitution expressly declares in the Fifth Article--the one  which deals with amendments--\"that no State, without its consent,  shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.\" This provision  was incorporated into the Constitution at the suggestion of Roger  Sherman of Connecticut. Certain other restrictions were imposed  which now have become unimportant, but which at the time were of the  greatest possible importance. It was provided that no amendment was to  be made prior to the year 1808 which should prohibit the States from  further importation of slaves, and that no capitation or other direct  tax should be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration  of the inhabitants of the states in which three-fifths only of the  slaves were included. So we see that the founders withdrew from the  possibilities of amendment the subjects regarding which they were  unwilling amendments should be made. The understanding of the  States therefore must have been that as respects all subjects not  so withdrawn the right of amendment might be exercised whenever the  States desired to exercise it. Whenever they do see fit to exercise  it they are not breaking faith with each other, or doing anything  wrongfully.    The mode of amending the Constitution is in strict accordance with the  doctrine of State Rights. The amending power is not to be exercised  by the collective people of the United States acting as a majority. It  can only be exercised by three-fourths of the States acting as States  in their sovereign capacity. If three-fourths of the States desire to  amend the instrument then the one-fourth must submit to the will of  the three-fourths. There is no principle in the doctrine of State  Rights which is violated when the Constitution is amended by the  three-fourths, for all the states have agreed that the three-fourths  shall possess the power to do so and that the minority will consent  to be bound by action so taken. The principle that the minority must  submit to the majority is a principle which the States apply to the  government of their local communities and to the people of their  several commonwealths. And it is a principle which the States as  sovereigns have agreed shall be applied to themselves in their  relations to each other and to the Federal Government. In creating the  amending power the framers of the Constitution were careful to  remove it from the people of the nation and to lodge it in the State  sovereignties. That is all that the believers in the doctrine of State  Rights asked. They could not wisely ask, and they did not ask, more.  They only asked that in so important a matter as the amendment of the  fundamental law the minority should not be compelled to submit to a  mere majority, but only to three-fourths of the whole.    If it be assumed simply for the purpose of this discussion, that the  amendment of the Constitution is not wholly a political question, no  one can seriously contend that the amendment the National American  Woman Suffrage Association urges violates any principle of law,  written or unwritten. Mr. Tucker makes no such claim. His argument,  as I understand it, is that woman suffrage by Federal Amendment is a  departure from the original thought of the makers of the Constitution;  that they left the subject of suffrage along with most other subjects  to be regulated by State action and that their decision upon that  question was wise and should not be disturbed. The same argument  exactly was made against the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth  Amendments and without effect. It can be made against any amendment  which can be proposed which deprives the States of any power which  they now possess.    When the Constitution was adopted it is true it did not confer the  right of suffrage upon any class, but left the subject to each  state to regulate in its own way. The members of the House of  Representatives were to be chosen by the people of the several States  and it was simply provided that \"the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#8)"],[1,"dots  and bands occasionally super-imposed on dark glaze (Figs. 7, 10, and  12).    White and orange disappear. Decoration stiffer and more conventional.      AEGEAN.    NEOLITHIC. Nothing known.    BRONZE AGE.    Contemporary with Early Minoan.    Pottery with geometric patterns normally dark on light buff or  reddish coarse clay. Sometimes red or white on black burnished clay.    Marble figurines 'fiddle-shaped' from Naxos and Paros (III, Fig. 6).    Contemporary with Middle Minoan.    Pottery with very pale sometimes greenish clay, and grey black  totally unlustrous paint. Patterns mainly geometric. Rather sparse  decoration. Later, with addition of red, decoration becomes fully  naturalistic. Lilies and birds in red and black (Melos) (III, Figs. 5 and  9; hatched lines=red). Beaked jugs (III, Fig. 5) most characteristic shape  of this period.    Cretan influence strong in Middle Minoan completely drowned local  efforts in first Late Minoan days. Thenceforward local ware  imitative.    SOUTH GREECE.    NEOLITHIC. Nothing known.    BRONZE AGE.  Geometric Ware with matt paint and pale clay corresponding to that of  islands found in Argolid and Boeotia.    'Urfirnis' Ware. Hand-made. Whole vase covered with thin semi-  lustrous wash varying from red-brown to black. Sometimes mere smears.  Mainly found in Boeotia, but extends north to valley of Spercheius  and south to Argolid. Date uncertain, but in Boeotia evidence that it  ended before rise of 'Minyan' ware.    'Minyan Ware.' Grey unpainted pottery, polished. No decoration except  (rarely) incised lines. Usually wheel-made. Characteristic shapes:  Goblet with tall ringed stem (III, Fig. 15); wide open cup with high  handles.    Appears to range Between Middle Minoan II and Late Minoan III.    Most frequent in Boeotia to which it owes its name. Found as far  north as Thessaly and as far south as Crete. Local imitations,  obvious but distinct, found with imported specimens (Melos).  Provenance unknown; connexion with Troy suspected.    'Mycenaean.' The Cretan civilization swept over South Greece in the  first Late Minoan period. Characterized by exuberance both in shape  and ornament (III, Figs. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17). Bulk of what is likely to be  found is of latest period when style has become conventionalized.  Compare Fig. 11 (Mycenaean) with III, Fig. 7 Late Minoan I. Characteristic  shapes high goblet and 'stirrup' vase (III, Figs. 17 and 16).    Female clay figurines common (III, Fig. 14), also animals, oxen.    Objects Characteristic of Aegean Civilization.    Seal Stones.  Round or bean-shaped, pierced for suspension, usually soft stone,  e.g. slate or steatite. Sometimes hard, as hematite or rock crystal.  Carved with naturalistic designs: lions, (III, Fig. 8), stags, bulls, cows  or hinds suckling their young, cuttle-fish, dolphins, &c. Two animals  ranged like heraldic supporters characteristic.    Obsidian.  Natural glass, volcanic, black. Source Melos. Used for knives  throughout Bronze Age.    Chips of Knife or razor blades, and sometimes the cores from which  these were flaked, may be picked up on any Bronze Age site, and even  on Thessalian neolithic settlements. Glistening black unmistakable.    Terra-cotta lamps.  The characteristic lamp of the Aegean civilization is open, as  opposed to the Greek and Roman lamp where the body is partly covered  in.    Walls.  Cyclopean walls of huge irregular stones. Also good square-cut  masonry.    'Corbelling' system for arches, each layer of stones projecting  inwards over the one below. Also used for the vaults of 'Beehive'  Tombs towards end of period.    [Illustration III: TYPES OF GREEK POTTERY, ETC.]      II. PREHISTORIC GREEK      Geometric or Dipylon Period.    Pottery.  Iron Age. circ. 1000 B.C.--Absolute break in continuity from what  preceded. No naturalism. Prevalence of geometric patterns (III, Figs. 18  and 19). Not much variety. Meanders, lozenges, and zigzags. Circles  joined by tangents replace Mycenaean spirals. Ornament crowded. Rows  or single specimens of long-legged water birds. Human figures rare,  rude angular silhouettes.    Local characteristics discernible (e.g. between ware of Thessaly,  Attica, Boeotia, Delphi, Argolid, Laconia, Thera, and Crete), but  strong family resemblance. (Lower specimen III, Fig. 19 characteristic of  Boeotia.) Dark paint on natural clay (sometimes lightened by a white  slip, e. g. Laconia) differs distinctly from Mycenaean. Shapes fewer  and curves less flowing. Amphorae, plates, bowls, and jugs. Trefoil  lip to jug first appears.    Terra-cotta loom weights from now onwards often pyramidal in form and  glazed.    Bronzes.  Figurines. Three types:--     Human, rare (as on vases).     Quadrupeds, mainly horses. Cylindrical muzzle and narrow     cylindrical belly (III, Fig. 23).     Birds. Long neck and legs, flat bill and body. Stands to above,     flat, square or round, with open-work snake or spiral.    Pins (to fasten dress at shoulder). Long head with small bosses  like strung beads sometimes separated by discs (III, Fig 21). Sometimes  larger flat disc at end of head (often missing) Pin itself usually  iron, rarely extant.    Brooches.    1. Spiral type. Of wire coiled into spirals. Made of one, two, or  three wires crossing with two, four, or six spirals respectively.  Boss at centre. Spectacle type (two spirals) common. In 'spectacle'  type (sometimes very large) spiral purely utilitarian, giving spring  to the pin. With four or more spirals the additions are ornament,  noteworthy in view of absence of spirals on pottery.    2. Bow type.     (a) High arched bow solid.     (b) Arched bow hollowed like boat inverted. This type often has  flat plate attached to one end, lower edge of which is bent to form  catch. Plate incised, crossed leaves, ships, horses, or men.     (c) Arched bow consisting of crescent-shaped plate, similar  incised decoration.    Paste Beads.  A type pyramidal, dark with yellow spirals round corners, much  resembling 'bull's eye' sweets, was common in Laconia (III, Fig.27).    Terra-cotta Figurines.  Series of rude horses sometimes with riders characteristic of end of  period. Chiefly from Boeotia. Painted like pottery, but chiefly in  lines.      III. ARCHAIC GREEK    A. Orientalising.    Pottery.  700 B.C.--Influence from Asia Minor. Recrudescence there of spirit of  Mycenaean art? Lions, stags, sphinxes, sirens, either in procession  or arranged in pairs like heraldic supporters.    Stylized plant motifs in decoration. Rays (or flower petals) rising  from foot most characteristic (III, Figs. 24, 26, and 28).    Use of purple paint to supplement black both for details of figures  and for band decoration.    Geometric ornament (though perhaps with a difference) survives to  fill blank spaces on backgrounds of scenes.    Varieties of style. Beasts drawn in silhouette, heads outlined, eyes,  &c., drawn in, early, and mainly in the islands (III, Fig. 29). Later  whole figures in silhouette with details incised, particularly  identified with Corinthian and Boeotian and Laconian styles (III, Fig.  26). Styles most likely to be found on the mainland are 'Proto-  Corinthian' and 'Corinthian'.    'Proto-Corinthian' (also called Argive Linear). Small vases, very  fine pale clay. Decoration chiefly horizontal lines very fine. Rays  from feet. Sometimes silhouette animals round shoulder.    Characteristic shapes: pear-shaped aryballoi, and lekythi with  conical body, long neck, and trefoil lip (III, Figs. 24 and 25).    'Corinthian'. Clay pale buff to warm biscuit colour. Rays round foot.  Purple bands. Rows of usual animals. Incisions. Details in purple.  Ground ornaments, incised rosettes more or less carefully drawn.  These in great profusion leaving very little bare space. (III, Fig. 26;  hatched lines=purple.) Throughout this period desire for a light  ground was felt, and where the natural colour of the clay did not  give sufficient contrast it was covered with a strip of cream-or  white clay (e.g. Rhodian, Naucratite, Laconian; see III, Fig. 28, Early  Laconian Vase).    Terra-cotta Figurines.  Series that culminates with Tanagra figures of fourth century begins.  May be said always to be a step in advance of contemporary sculpture  if any.    Statuettes rare at this date, but relief heads on flat plaques or on  vase handles common. Treatment of hair usually resembles Restoration  wig (III, Fig. 20). Rosette frequent on shoulders represents head of  bronze (rarely silver or gold) shoulder pin.    Bronzes.  Pins (to fasten dress at shoulder). Three large bosses increasing  in size as they near head replace many small equal bosses of  preceding period. Disc heavier (III, Fig. 22).    Brooches. Spiral type has disappeared. Couchant lion type with  snake tail has been found at Olympia and Sparta. In general brooches  cease to be common.    Plaques (doubtless affixed to wood). Relief patterns of guilloches  or rows of bosses. Figure scenes similar to those on pottery.  Characteristic of seventh century. Chance of picking up slight.    Inscriptions. Earliest extant examples of use of Greek script on  stone may date from this period. For developments, see tables of  alphabets, Illustration IV.      [Illustration IV: GREEK ALPHABETS]      B. Black Figured Period.    600 B.C.--Predominance of Attic pottery. Decay of local styles.  Introduction of red colouring into clay and of superlative Attic  black glaze.    Figure scenes (battle scenes and scenes from mythology) largely  predominate. Black silhouettes, details marked with fine incisions,  additions of purple and white (latter for linen and flesh of women).  Elaborate palmettos characteristic (III, Fig. 31).      IV. CLASSICAL GREEK    Red Figured Period.  525 B.C. Same clay and glaze, but whole vase covered with glaze and  figures reserved showing in colour of clay, details being added with  fine-drawn lines of glaze.    White Attic Vases.
