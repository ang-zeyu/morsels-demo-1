When King Arthur heard of their treachery and their return, he burned with  anger till his eyes shone like two torches, and then he swore a mighty  oath to rest no more until he had utterly destroyed those enemies of God  and man, and had rooted them for ever out of the land of Britain. Then  marching hotly with his armies on to Bath, he cried aloud to them, \"Since  these detestable impious heathens disdain to keep their faith with me, to  keep faith with God, to whom I sware to cherish and defend this realm,  will now this day avenge on them the blood of all that they have slain in  Britain!\"    In like manner after him spoke the archbishop, standing upon a hill, and  crying that to-day they should fight both for their country and for  Paradise, \"For whoso,\" he said, \"shall in this holy war be slain, the  angels shall forthwith receive him; for death in this cause shall be  penance and absolution for all sins.\"    At these words every man in the whole army raged with hatred, and pressed  eagerly to rush upon those savages.    Anon King Arthur, dressed in armour shining with gold and jewels, and  wearing on his head a helmet with a golden dragon, took a shield painted  with the likeness of the blessed Mary. Then girding on Excalibur and  taking in his right hand his great lance Ron, he placed his men in order  and led them out against the enemy, who stood for battle on the slope of  Badon Hill, ranged in the form of a wedge, as their custom was. And they,  resisting all the onslaughts of King Arthur and his host, made that day a  stout defence, and at night lay down upon the hill.    But on the next day Arthur led his army once again to the attack, and with  wounds and slaughter such as no man had ever seen before, he drove the  heathen step by step before him, backwards and upwards, till he stood with  all his noblest knights upon the summit of the hill.    And then men saw him, \"red as the rising sun from spur to plume,\" lift up  his sword, and, kneeling, kiss the cross of it; and after, rising to his  feet, set might and main with all his fellowship upon the foe, till, as a  troop of lions roaring for their prey, they drove them like a scattered  herd along the plains, and cut them down till they could cut no more for  weariness.    That day King Arthur by himself alone slew with his word Excalibur four  hundred and seventy heathens. Colgrin also, and his brother Baldulph, were  slain.    Then the king bade Cador, Duke of Cornwall, follow Cheldric, the chief  leader, and the remnant of his hosts, unto the uttermost. He, therefore,  when he had first seized their fleet, and filled it with chosen men, to  beat them back when they should fly to it at last, chased them and slew  them without mercy so long as he could overtake them. And though they  crept with trembling hearts for shelter to the coverts of the woods and  dens of mountains, yet even so they found no safety, for Cador slew them,  even one by one. Last of all he caught and slew Cheldric himself, and  slaughtering a great multitude took hostages for the surrender of the  rest.    Meanwhile, King Arthur turned from Badon Hill, and freed his nephew Hoel  from the Scots and Picts, who besieged him in Alclud. And when he had  defeated them in three sore battles, he drove them before him to a lake,  which was one of the most wondrous lakes in all the world, for it was fed  by sixty rivers, and had sixty islands, and sixty rocks, and on every  island sixty eagles' nests. But King Arthur with a great fleet sailed  round the rivers and besieged them in the lake for fifteen days, so that  many thousands died of hunger.    Anon the King of Ireland came with an army to relieve them; but Arthur,  turning on him fiercely, routed him, and compelled him to retreat in  terror to his land. Then he pursued his purpose, which was no less to  destroy the race of Picts and Scots, who, beyond memory, had been a  ceaseless torment to the Britons by their barbarous malice.    So bitterly, therefore, did he treat them, giving quarter to none, that at  length the bishops of that miserable country with the clergy met together,  and, bearing all the holy relics, came barefooted to the king to pray his  mercy for their people. As soon as they were led before him they fell down  upon their knees, and piteously besought him to spare the few survivors of  their countrymen, and grant them any corner of the land where they might  live in peace. When he thus heard them, and knew that he had now fully  punished them, he consented to their prayer, and withdrew his hosts from  any further slaughter.    Then turned he back to his own realm, and came to York for Christmas, and  there with high solemnity observed that holy tide; and being passing  grieved to see the ruin of the churches and houses, which the rage or the  pagans had destroyed, he rebuilt them, and restored the city to its  ancient happy state.    And on a certain day, as the king sat with his barons, there came into the  court a squire on horseback, carrying a knight before him wounded to the  death, and told the king that hard by in the forest was a knight who had  reared up a pavilion by the fountain, \"and hath slain my master, a valiant  knight, whose name was Nirles; wherefore I beseech thee, Lord, my master  may be buried, and that some good knight may avenge his death.\"    At that stepped forth a squire named Griflet, who was very young, being of  the same age with King Arthur, and besought the king, for all the service  he had done, to give him knighthood.    \"Thou art full young and tender of age,\" said King Arthur, \"to take so  high an order upon thee.\"    \"Sir,\" said Griflet, \"I beseech thee make me a knight;\" and Merlin also  advising the king to grant his request, \"Well,\" said Arthur, \"be it then  so,\" and knighted him forthwith. Then said he to him, \"Since I have  granted thee this favour, thou must in turn grant me a gift.\"    \"Whatsoever thou wilt, my lord,\" replied Sir Griflet.    \"Promise me,\" said King Arthur, \"by the faith of thy body, that when thou  hast jousted with this knight at the fountain, thou wilt return to me  straightway, unless he slay thee.\"    \"I promise,\" said Sir Griflet; and taking his horse in haste, he dressed  his shield, and took a spear in his hand and rode full gallop till he came  to the fountain, by the side of which he saw a rich pavilion, and a great  horse standing well saddled and bridled, and on a tree close by there hung  a shield of many colours and a long lance.    Then Sir Griflet smote upon the shield with the butt of his spear until he  cast it to the ground. At that a knight came out of the pavilion and said,  \"Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield?\"    \"Because,\" said Griflet, \"I would joust with thee.\"    \"It were better not,\" replied the knight; \"for thou art young and but  lately made a knight, and thy strength is small compared to mine.\"    \"For all that,\" said Sir Griflet, \"I will joust with ye.\"    \"I am full loath,\" replied the knight; \"but if I must I must.\"    Then did they wheel their horses far apart, and running them together,  the strange knight shivered Sir Griflet's spear to fragments, and smote  him through the shield and the left side, and broke his own spear into Sir  Griflet's body, so that the truncheon stuck there, and Sir Griflet and his  horse fell down. But when the strange knight saw him overthrown, he was  sore grieved, and hastily alighted, for he thought that he had slain him.  Then he unlaced his helm and gave him air, and tended him carefully till  he came out of his swoon, and leaving the truncheon of his spear in his  body, he set him upon horse, and commended him to God, and said he had a  mighty heart, and if he lived would prove a passing good knight. And so  Sir Griflet rode to the court, where, by aid of good physicians, he was  healed in time and his life saved.    At that same time there came before the king twelve old men, ambassadors  from Lucius Tiberius, Emperor of Rome, and demanded of Arthur tribute unto  Caesar for his realm, or else, said they, the emperor would destroy both  him and his land. To whom King Arthur answered that he owed the emperor no  tribute, nor would send him any; but said he, \"On a fair field I will pay  him his proper tribute--with a sharp spear and sword; and by my father's  soul that tribute shall he take from me, whether he will or not.\" So the  ambassadors departed passing wroth, and King Arthur was as wroth as they.    But on the morrow of Sir Griflet's hurt, the king commanded to take his  horse and armour secretly outside the city walls before sunrise of the  next morning, and, rising a long while before dawn, he mounted up and took  his shield and spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry till he came again;  but he forbore to take Excalibur, for he had given it for safety into  charge of his sister, Queen Morgan le Fay. And as the king rode at a soft  pace he saw suddenly three villains chasing Merlin and making to attack  and slay him. Clapping spurs to his horse, he rushed towards them, and  cried out in a terrible voice, \"Flee, churls, or take your deaths;\" but  they, as soon as they perceived a knight, fled away with the haste of  hares.    \"O Merlin,\" said the king; \"here hadst thou been killed, despite thy many  crafts, had I not chanced to pass.\"    \"Not so,\" said Merlin, \"for when I would, I could have saved myself; but  thou art nearer to thy death than I, for without special help from heaven  thou ridest now towards thy grave.\"    And as they were thus talking, they came to the fountain and the rich  pavilion pitched beside it, and saw a knight sitting all armed on a chair  in the opening of the tent. \"Sir knight,\" said King Arthur, \"for what  cause abidest thou here? to joust with any knight that passeth by? If so,  I caution thee to quit that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#8)"],[1,"o'clock, a long line of boats drawn by a steam tug, as big  as a fly, and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke,  passed my gate.    After two English schooners, whose red flag fluttered toward the sky,  there came a magnificent Brazilian three-master; it was perfectly white  and wonderfully clean and shining. I saluted it, I hardly know why,  except that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure.    _May 12th._ I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days,  and I feel ill, or rather I feel low-spirited.    Whence do these mysterious influences come, which change our happiness  into discouragement, and our self-confidence into diffidence? One might  almost say that the air, the invisible air is full of unknowable  Forces, whose mysterious presence we have to endure. I wake up in the  best spirits, with an inclination to sing in my throat. Why? I go down  by the side of the water, and suddenly, after walking a short distance,  I return home wretched, as if some misfortune were awaiting me there.  Why? Is it a cold shiver which, passing over my skin, has upset my  nerves and given me low spirits? Is it the form of the clouds, or the  color of the sky, or the color of the surrounding objects which is so  changeable, which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my  eyes? Who can tell? Everything that surrounds us, everything that we  see without looking at it, everything that we touch without knowing it,  everything that we handle without feeling it, all that we meet without  clearly distinguishing it, has a rapid, surprising and inexplicable  effect upon us and upon our organs, and through them on our ideas and  on our heart itself.    How profound that mystery of the Invisible is! We cannot fathom it with  our miserable senses, with our eyes which are unable to perceive what  is either too small or too great, too near to, or too far from us;  neither the inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water ... with our  ears that deceive us, for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air  in sonorous notes. They are fairies who work the miracle of changing  that movement into noise, and by that metamorphosis give birth to  music, which makes the mute agitation of nature musical ... with our  sense of smell which is smaller than that of a dog ... with our sense  of taste which can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine!    Oh! If we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our  favor, what a number of fresh things we might discover around us!    _May 16th._ I am ill, decidedly! I was so well last month! I am  feverish, horribly feverish, or rather I am in a state of feverish  enervation, which makes my mind suffer as much as my body. I have  without ceasing that horrible sensation of some danger threatening me,  that apprehension of some coming misfortune or of approaching death,  that presentiment which is, no doubt, an attack of some illness which  is still unknown, which germinates in the flesh and in the blood.    _May 18th._ I have just come from consulting my medical man, for I  could no longer get any sleep. He found that my pulse was high, my eyes  dilated, my nerves highly strung, but no alarming symptoms. I must have  a course of shower-baths and of bromide of potassium.    _May 25th._ No change! My state is really very peculiar. As the evening  comes on, an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me, just as  if night concealed some terrible menace toward me. I dine quickly, and  then try to read, but I do not understand the words, and can scarcely  distinguish the letters. Then I walk up and down my drawing-room,  oppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear, the fear of  sleep and fear of my bed.    About ten o'clock I go up to my room. As soon as I have got in I double  lock, and bolt it: I am frightened--of what? Up till the present time I  have been frightened of nothing--I open my cupboards, and look under my  bed; I listen--I listen--to what? How strange it is that a simple  feeling of discomfort, impeded or heightened circulation, perhaps the  irritation of a nervous thread, a slight congestion, a small disturbance  in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living machinery, can  turn the most lighthearted of men into a melancholy one, and make a  coward of the bravest! Then, I go to bed, and I wait for sleep as a man  might wait for the executioner. I wait for its coming with dread, and  my heart beats and my legs tremble, while my whole body shivers beneath  the warmth of the bedclothes, until the moment when I suddenly fall  asleep, as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant water in  order to drown oneself. I do not feel coming over me, as I used to do  formerly, this perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me,  which is going to seize me by the head, to close my eyes and annihilate  me.    I sleep--a long time--two or three hours perhaps--then a dream--no--a  nightmare lays hold on me. I feel that I am in bed and asleep--I feel  it and I know it--and I feel also that somebody is coming close to me,  is looking at me, touching me, is getting on to my bed, is kneeling on  my chest, is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing  it--squeezing it with all his might in order to strangle me.    I struggle, bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in  our dreams; I try to cry out--but I cannot; I want to move--I cannot; I  try, with the most violent efforts and out of breath, to turn over and  throw off this being which is crushing and suffocating me--I cannot!    And then, suddenly, I wake up, shaken and bathed in perspiration; I  light a candle and find that I am alone, and after that crisis, which  occurs every night, I at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till  morning.    _June 2d._ My state has grown worse. What is the matter with me? The  bromide does me no good, and the shower-baths have no effect whatever.  Sometimes, in order to tire myself out, though I am fatigued enough  already, I go for a walk in the forest of Roumare. I used to think at  first that the fresh light and soft air, impregnated with the odor of  herbs and leaves, would instill new blood into my veins and impart  fresh energy to my heart. I turned into a broad ride in the wood, and  then I turned toward La Bouille, through a narrow path, between two  rows of exceedingly tall trees, which placed a thick, green, almost  black roof between the sky and me.    A sudden shiver ran through me, not a cold shiver, but a shiver of  agony, and so I hastened my steps, uneasy at being alone in the wood,  frightened stupidly and without reason, at the profound solitude.  Suddenly it seemed to me as if I were being followed, that somebody was  walking at my heels, close, quite close to me, near enough to touch me.    I turned round suddenly, but I was alone. I saw nothing behind me  except the straight, broad ride, empty and bordered by high trees,  horribly empty; on the other side it also extended until it was lost in  the distance, and looked just the same, terrible.    I closed my eyes. Why? And then I began to turn round on one heel very  quickly, just like a top. I nearly fell down, and opened my eyes; the  trees were dancing round me and the earth heaved; I was obliged to sit  down. Then, ah! I no longer remembered how I had come! What a strange  idea! What a strange, strange idea! I did not the least know. I started  off to the right, and got back into the avenue which had led me into  the middle of the forest.    _June 3d._ I have had a terrible night. I shall go away for a few  weeks, for no doubt a journey will set me up again.    _July 2d._ I have come back, quite cured, and have had a most  delightful trip into the bargain. I have been to Mont Saint-Michel,  which I had not seen before.    What a sight, when one arrives as I did, at Avranches toward the end of  the day! The town stands on a hill, and I was taken into the public  garden at the extremity of the town. I uttered a cry of astonishment.  An extraordinarily large bay lay extended before me, as far as my eyes  could reach, between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist;  and in the middle of this immense yellow bay, under a clear, golden  sky, a peculiar hill rose up, somber and pointed in the midst of the  sand. The sun had just disappeared, and under the still flaming sky the  outline of that fantastic rock stood out, which bears on its summit a  fantastic monument.    At daybreak I went to it. The tide was low as it had been the night  before, and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as I  approached it. After several hours' walking, I reached the enormous  mass of rocks which supports the little town, dominated by the great  church. Having climbed the steep and narrow street, I entered the most  wonderful Gothic building that has ever been built to God on earth, as  large as a town, full of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted  roofs, and lofty galleries supported by delicate columns.    I entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of  lace, covered with towers, with slender belfries to which spiral  staircases ascend, and which raise their strange heads that bristle  with chimeras, with devils, with fantastic animals, with monstrous  flowers, and which are joined together by finely carved arches, to the  blue sky by day, and to the black sky by night.    When I had reached the summit, I said to the monk who accompanied me:  \"Father, how happy you must be here!\" And he replied: \"It is very  windy, Monsieur;\" and so we began to talk while watching the rising  tide, which ran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass.    And then the monk told me stories, all the old stories belonging to the  place, legends, nothing but legends.    One of them struck me forcibly. The country people, those belonging to  the Mornet, declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the  sand, and"]]]
