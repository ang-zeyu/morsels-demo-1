Young, of Princeton, in his Astronomy, p. 156, says, \"The solar  radiation can be accounted for on the hypothesis first proposed by  Helmholtz, that the sun is shrinking slowly but continually. It is a  matter of demonstration that an annual shrinkage of about 300 feet in  the sun's diameter would liberate sufficient heat to keep up its  radiation without any fall in its temperature\".... The sun is not  simply cooling, nor is its heat caused by combustion; for, \"If the sun  were a vast globe of solid anthracite, in less than 5,000 years, it  would be burned to a cinder.\" We quote from Prof. Young's Astronomy:  \"We can only say that while no other theory yet proposed meets the  conditions of the problem, this [contraction theory] appears to do so  perfectly, and therefore has high probability in its favor.\" \"No  conclusion of Geometry,\" he continues, \"is more certain than  this,--that the shrinkage of the sun to its present dimensions, from a  diameter larger than that of the orbit of Neptune, the remotest of the  planets, _would generate about 18,000,000 times as much heat as the  sun now radiates in a year_. Hence, if the sun's heat has been and  still is wholly due to the contraction of its mass, it can not have  been radiating heat at the present rate, on the shrinkage hypothesis,  for more than 18,000,000 years; and on that hypothesis, the solar  system in anything like its present condition, can not be much more  than as old as that.\" If so, evolution, on account of lack of time,  can not possibly be true. If we add many millions of years to this  number, or double it more than once, the time is not yet  sufficient. For if the sun is 25,000,000, or even 50,000,000 years  old, by the time the planets are thrown off, in turn, from Neptune to  the earth, and then the earth cooled sufficiently for animal life,  only a few million years would be left for evolution, a mere fraction  of the time required. This is a mathematical demonstration that  evolution can not be true. The same calculations, 18,000,000 to  20,000,000 years, have been made by Lord Kelvin, Prof. Todd and other  astronomers.    2. The thickness of the earth's crust is fatal to the theory of the  great age of the earth, required by evolution.  The temperature  increases as we descend into the earth, about one degree for every 50  feet, or 100 degrees per mile.  Therefore, at 2 mi., water would boil;  at 18 mi., glass would melt (1850°); at 28 mi., every known substance  would melt (2700°). Hence the crust is not likely more than 28 miles  thick,--in many places less. Rev. O. Fisher has calculated that, if  the thickness of the earth's crust is 17.5 mi., as indicated by the  San Francisco earthquake, the earth is 5,262,170 years old. If the  crust is 21.91 mi.  thick, as others say, the age would be 8,248,380  years. Lord Kelvin, the well known scientist, who computed the sun's  age at 20,000,000 years, computed the earth's age at 8,302,210  years. Subtract from these computations, the years that must have  elapsed before the earth became cool enough for animal life, and the  few millions of years left would be utterly insufficient to render  evolution possible.  Note how these figures agree with the age of the  earth according to the Helmholtz contraction theory. The thinness of  the earth's crust is also proven by the geysers, the volcanoes, and  the 9000 tremors and earthquakes occurring annually in all parts of  the world.    3. The surface marks on the earth point to much shorter periods of  time since the earth was a shoreless ocean than those required by  evolutionists, who are so reckless in their guesses and  estimates. They help themselves to eternity without stint. Charles  Lyell, a geologist of Darwin's time, set the example when he said,  \"The lowest estimate of time required for the formation of the  existing delta of the Mississippi is 100,000 years.\" According to  careful examination made by gentlemen of the Coast Survey and other  U.S. officers, the time was 4,400 years--a disinterested decision. In  the face of these three arguments, it is a bit reckless to say the  earth has existed, 1,600,000,000 years,--nearly 100 times as long as  proven possible by mathematical calculation. And still more reckless  is the estimate of Prof. Russell, 4,000,000,000 to 8,000,000,000  years, founded on the radio-activity theory.  All these wild estimates  are out of the question.    The recession of the Niagara Falls from Lake Ontario required only  7,000 to 11,000 years. It required only 8,000 years for the  Mississippi River to excavate its course.    Prof. Winchell estimates that the Mississippi River, has worn a gorge  100 feet deep, 8 miles long, back to the Falls of St. Anthony, in  about 8,000 years. The whole thickness of the Nile sediment, 40 feet  in one place, was deposited in about 13,000 years. Calculations by  Southall and others from certain strata have fixed man's first  appearance on the earth at 8,000 years, in harmony with Scripture.    LeConte, in his Geology, p. 19, says, \"Making due allowance for all  variations, it is probable that all land-surfaces are being cut down  and lowered by rain and river erosion, at a rate of one foot every  5,000 years. At this rate, if we take the mean height of lands as 1200  feet, and there be no antagonistic agency at work raising the land,  all lands would be cut down to the sea level and disappear in  6,000,000 years.\"    May we not from these data, judge approximately of the age of the  world, and show by this proof also, that the world can not be at all  as old as the evolution theory demands? If the surface of the earth  will be worn down 1200 feet on an average in 6,000,000 years, would it  not also be true that the surface has been worn down at least 1200  feet in the last 6,000,000 years? For the higher the surface, the more  rapid the erosion. And if the earth is 8,302,210 years old, as Lord  Kelvin computes, then at the same rate, it must have been worn down an  average of 1660 feet,--38% more than remains. Is this not a fair  estimate for the amount of erosion and the age of the world? How high  must the land have averaged, if the world is even 60,000,000 years  old?    If this be true, how long would it have taken erosion in the past, to  reduce the land to its present configuration,--the short period  indicated by science, or the immensely long period required by  evolution?    But the evolutionists are clinging to the radio-activity theory  desperately, an S.O.S. of a lost cause, depending, like evolution, on  a great many assumptions, and unproven hypotheses. The assumption is  that a radio-active substance, like uranium, \"decays,\" or passes into  many other substances, of which radium is one, finally producing lead  in 1,000,000,000 years or more. From this theory, Prof.  Russell  concludes that the earth is 4,000,000,000 to 8,000,000,000 years old,  and the sun is older still. During this inconceivably long period, the  sun was giving out as much heat as at present, which is 2,200,000,000  times as much as the earth receives. The heat of the sun can not be  accounted for, by either the combustion or cooling off theory. By the  commonly accepted contraction theory, the heat has been maintained  only about 20,000,000 years.  How could it have been sustained  4,000,000,000 to 8,000,000,000 years? Prof. Russell answers: \"We must  therefore _suppose_ that energy from an 'unknown source' becomes  available at exceedingly high temperatures.... We can not do more than  _guess_ where it is hidden.\" Is this scientific? This theory,  moreover, is interlocked with Einstein's theory of Relativity, which  holds that all energy has mass, and all mass is equivalent to  energy. Although 2700 books have been written, pro and con, upon  Einstein's theory, yet he says only 12 men understand it, and a  scientist retorts that Einstein can not be one of the 12.  The  contraction theory, the thickness of the cooled crust of the earth,  and the conformation of its surface, all give mathematical proof that  evolution is impossible because of lack of time.        11. GEOLOGY AND HISTORY      During the historical period, the species have remained unchanged. If  over 1,000,000 species of animals have arisen in the 60,000,000 years,  as is claimed, over 2000 of them must have arisen in the last 6,000  years. As evolutionists can not name a single new species that has  arisen within that time, their theory falls to the ground. No species  in that time, has passed into another. No species has been divided  into two or more. No lower species has advanced into a higher. History  gives no scrap of evidence in support of evolution. Even the horse,  whose history has been dubiously traced for 3,000,000 years, has been  a horse unchanged for the last 6,000 years. Even if the missing links  in the development of the horse _could_ be supplied, it would  still be the same species all the while.  But there are no  transitional forms showing alleged changes in the development of the  horse from the four-toed creature of squirrel like size. Many  varieties and individuals under the skill of man have been developed  and improved, but not a single new species in historic time.  There  are 5,000 varieties of apples but no new species. But when the  evolutionist is hard pressed to answer, he takes to the wilds of  eternity where it is hard to pursue him, and to check up on his  guesses. He answers that changes are so slow, and take so many  millions of years, that they can not tell of a single new species in  the last 6,000 years, when over 2,000 are required.    He appeals to Geology, which is history down to historic time,  expecting to take advantage of the ignorance of the careless student.    But Geology will not aid him to prove his reckless theory. Even Darwin  complained that the evidences from Geology were scanty. Geology  testifies: The genera and species of fossil animals are as distinct as  those now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#7)"],[1,"nces.    Two conclusions emerge from these general statements. On the one hand,  purely external direction is impossible. The environment can at most  only supply stimuli to call out responses. These responses proceed from  tendencies already possessed by the individual. Even when a person  is frightened by threats into doing something, the threats work only  because the person has an instinct of fear. If he has not, or if, though  having it, it is under his own control, the threat has no more influence  upon him than light has in causing a person to see who has no eyes.  While the customs and rules of adults furnish stimuli which direct  as well as evoke the activities of the young, the young, after all,  participate in the direction which their actions finally take. In the  strict sense, nothing can be forced upon them or into them. To overlook  this fact means to distort and pervert human nature. To take into  account the contribution made by the existing instincts and habits  of those directed is to direct them economically and wisely. Speaking  accurately, all direction is but re-direction; it shifts the activities  already going on into another channel. Unless one is cognizant of the  energies which are already in operation, one's attempts at direction  will almost surely go amiss.    On the other hand, the control afforded by the customs and regulations  of others may be short-sighted. It may accomplish its immediate effect,  but at the expense of throwing the subsequent action of the person  out of balance. A threat may, for example, prevent a person from  doing something to which he is naturally inclined by arousing fear of  disagreeable consequences if he persists. But he may be left in the  position which exposes him later on to influences which will lead him  to do even worse things. His instincts of cunning and slyness may be  aroused, so that things henceforth appeal to him on the side of evasion  and trickery more than would otherwise have been the case. Those engaged  in directing the actions of others are always in danger of overlooking  the importance of the sequential development of those they direct.    2. Modes of Social Direction. Adults are naturally most conscious of  directing the conduct of others when they are immediately aiming so  to do. As a rule, they have such an aim consciously when they find  themselves resisted; when others are doing things they do not wish them  to do. But the more permanent and influential modes of control are those  which operate from moment to moment continuously without such deliberate  intention on our part.    1. When others are not doing what we would like them to or are  threatening disobedience, we are most conscious of the need of  controlling them and of the influences by which they are controlled. In  such cases, our control becomes most direct, and at this point we are  most likely to make the mistakes just spoken of. We are even likely to  take the influence of superior force for control, forgetting that while  we may lead a horse to water we cannot make him drink; and that while we  can shut a man up in a penitentiary we cannot make him penitent. In  all such cases of immediate action upon others, we need to discriminate  between physical results and moral results. A person may be in such a  condition that forcible feeding or enforced confinement is necessary for  his own good. A child may have to be snatched with roughness away from  a fire so that he shall not be burnt. But no improvement of disposition,  no educative effect, need follow. A harsh and commanding tone may be  effectual in keeping a child away from the fire, and the same desirable  physical effect will follow as if he had been snatched away. But there  may be no more obedience of a moral sort in one case than in the other.  A man can be prevented from breaking into other persons' houses by  shutting him up, but shutting him up may not alter his disposition to  commit burglary. When we confuse a physical with an educative result,  we always lose the chance of enlisting the person's own participating  disposition in getting the result desired, and thereby of developing  within him an intrinsic and persisting direction in the right way.    In general, the occasion for the more conscious acts of control should  be limited to acts which are so instinctive or impulsive that the one  performing them has no means of foreseeing their outcome. If a person  cannot foresee the consequences of his act, and is not capable of  understanding what he is told about its outcome by those with more  experience, it is impossible for him to guide his act intelligently. In  such a state, every act is alike to him. Whatever moves him does move  him, and that is all there is to it. In some cases, it is well to permit  him to experiment, and to discover the consequences for himself in order  that he may act intelligently next time under similar circumstances. But  some courses of action are too discommoding and obnoxious to others to  allow of this course being pursued. Direct disapproval is now resorted  to. Shaming, ridicule, disfavor, rebuke, and punishment are used. Or  contrary tendencies in the child are appealed to to divert him from his  troublesome line of behavior. His sensitiveness to approbation, his hope  of winning favor by an agreeable act, are made use of to induce action  in another direction.    2. These methods of control are so obvious (because so intentionally  employed) that it would hardly be worth while to mention them if it were  not that notice may now be taken, by way of contrast, of the other more  important and permanent mode of control. This other method resides in  the ways in which persons, with whom the immature being is associated,  use things; the instrumentalities with which they accomplish their own  ends. The very existence of the social medium in which an individual  lives, moves, and has his being is the standing effective agency of  directing his activity.    This fact makes it necessary for us to examine in greater detail what  is meant by the social environment. We are given to separating from  each other the physical and social environments in which we live. The  separation is responsible on one hand for an exaggeration of the moral  importance of the more direct or personal modes of control of which  we have been speaking; and on the other hand for an exaggeration, in  current psychology and philosophy, of the intellectual possibilities of  contact with a purely physical environment. There is not, in fact, any  such thing as the direct influence of one human being on another apart  from use of the physical environment as an intermediary. A smile, a  frown, a rebuke, a word of warning or encouragement, all involve some  physical change. Otherwise, the attitude of one would not get over to  alter the attitude of another. Comparatively speaking, such modes of  influence may be regarded as personal. The physical medium is reduced to  a mere means of personal contact. In contrast with such direct modes of  mutual influence, stand associations in common pursuits involving the  use of things as means and as measures of results. Even if the mother  never told her daughter to help her, or never rebuked her for not  helping, the child would be subjected to direction in her activities  by the mere fact that she was engaged, along with the parent, in the  household life. Imitation, emulation, the need of working together,  enforce control.    If the mother hands the child something needed, the latter must reach  the thing in order to get it. Where there is giving there must be  taking. The way the child handles the thing after it is got, the use  to which it is put, is surely influenced by the fact that the child  has watched the mother. When the child sees the parent looking for  something, it is as natural for it also to look for the object and to  give it over when it finds it, as it was, under other circumstances, to  receive it. Multiply such an instance by the thousand details of daily  intercourse, and one has a picture of the most permanent and enduring  method of giving direction to the activities of the young.    In saying this, we are only repeating what was said previously  about participating in a joint activity as the chief way of forming  disposition. We have explicitly added, however, the recognition of the  part played in the joint activity by the use of things. The philosophy  of learning has been unduly dominated by a false psychology. It is  frequently stated that a person learns by merely having the qualities of  things impressed upon his mind through the gateway of the senses. Having  received a store of sensory impressions, association or some power of  mental synthesis is supposed to combine them into ideas--into things  with a meaning. An object, stone, orange, tree, chair, is supposed to  convey different impressions of color, shape, size, hardness, smell,  taste, etc., which aggregated together constitute the characteristic  meaning of each thing. But as matter of fact, it is the characteristic  use to which the thing is put, because of its specific qualities, which  supplies the meaning with which it is identified. A chair is a thing  which is put to one use; a table, a thing which is employed for another  purpose; an orange is a thing which costs so much, which is grown in  warm climes, which is eaten, and when eaten has an agreeable odor and  refreshing taste, etc.    The difference between an adjustment to a physical stimulus and a mental  act is that the latter involves response to a thing in its meaning;  the former does not. A noise may make me jump without my mind being  implicated. When I hear a noise and run and get water and put out a  blaze, I respond intelligently; the sound meant fire, and fire meant  need of being extinguished. I bump into a stone, and kick it to one side  purely physically. I put it to one side for fear some"]]]
