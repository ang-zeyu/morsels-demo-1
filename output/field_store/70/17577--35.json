Forthwith brighter far  Than erst, it wax'd: and, as himself the sun  Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze  Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey'd;  Within its proper ray the saintly shape  Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal'd;  And, shrouded so in splendour answer'd me,  E'en as the tenour of my song declares.          CANTO VI    \"After that Constantine the eagle turn'd  Against the motions of the heav'n, that roll'd  Consenting with its course, when he of yore,  Lavinia's spouse, was leader of the flight,  A hundred years twice told and more, his seat  At Europe's extreme point, the bird of Jove  Held, near the mountains, whence he issued first.  There, under shadow of his sacred plumes  Swaying the world, till through successive hands  To mine he came devolv'd.  Caesar I was,  And am Justinian; destin'd by the will  Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,  From vain excess to clear th' encumber'd laws.  Or ere that work engag'd me, I did hold  Christ's nature merely human, with such faith  Contented.  But the blessed Agapete,  Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice  To the true faith recall'd me.  I believ'd  His words: and what he taught, now plainly see,  As thou in every contradiction seest  The true and false oppos'd.  Soon as my feet  Were to the church reclaim'd, to my great task,  By inspiration of God's grace impell'd,  I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms  To Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand  Was link'd in such conjointment, 't was a sign  That I should rest.  To thy first question thus  I shape mine answer, which were ended here,  But that its tendency doth prompt perforce  To some addition; that thou well, mayst mark  What reason on each side they have to plead,  By whom that holiest banner is withstood,  Both who pretend its power and who oppose.    \"Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died  To give it rule, behold the valorous deeds  Have made it worthy reverence.  Not unknown  To thee, how for three hundred years and more  It dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists  Where for its sake were met the rival three;  Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev'd  Down to the Sabines' wrong to Lucrece' woe,  With its sev'n kings conqu'ring the nation round;  Nor all it wrought, by Roman worthies home  'Gainst Brennus and th' Epirot prince, and hosts  Of single chiefs, or states in league combin'd  Of social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,  And Quintius nam'd of his neglected locks,  The Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir'd  Their fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm.  By it the pride of Arab hordes was quell'd,  When they led on by Hannibal o'erpass'd  The Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!  Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days  Scipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,  Under whose summit thou didst see the light,  Rued its stern bearing.  After, near the hour,  When heav'n was minded that o'er all the world  His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's hand  Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought  From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,  Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills  The torrent Rhone.  What after that it wrought,  When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap'd  The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,  That tongue nor pen may follow it.  Tow'rds Spain  It wheel'd its bands, then tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,  And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,  E'en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;  Its native shores Antandros, and the streams  Of Simois revisited, and there  Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy  His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell  On Juba; and the next upon your west,  At sound of the Pompeian trump, return'd.    \"What following and in its next bearer's gripe  It wrought, is now by Cassius and Brutus  Bark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sons  And Modena's was mourn'd.  Hence weepeth still  Sad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,  Took from the adder black and sudden death.  With him it ran e'en to the Red Sea coast;  With him compos'd the world to such a peace,  That of his temple Janus barr'd the door.    \"But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,  And was appointed to perform thereafter,  Throughout the mortal kingdom which it sway'd,  Falls in appearance dwindled and obscur'd,  If one with steady eye and perfect thought  On the third Caesar look; for to his hands,  The living Justice, in whose breath I move,  Committed glory, e'en into his hands,  To execute the vengeance of its wrath.    \"Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.  After with Titus it was sent to wreak  Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,  And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,  Did gore the bosom of the holy church,  Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne  Sped to her rescue.  Judge then for thyself  Of those, whom I erewhile accus'd to thee,  What they are, and how grievous their offending,  Who are the cause of all your ills.  The one  Against the universal ensign rears  The yellow lilies, and with partial aim  That to himself the other arrogates:  So that 't is hard to see which more offends.  Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts  Beneath another standard: ill is this  Follow'd of him, who severs it and justice:  And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd Charles  Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,  Which from a lion of more lofty port  Have rent the easing.  Many a time ere now  The sons have for the sire's transgression wail'd;  Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav'n  Will truck its armour for his lilied shield.    \"This little star is furnish'd with good spirits,  Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,  That honour and renown might wait on them:  And, when desires thus err in their intention,  True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.  But it is part of our delight, to measure  Our wages with the merit; and admire  The close proportion.  Hence doth heav'nly justice  Temper so evenly affection in us,  It ne'er can warp to any wrongfulness.  Of diverse voices is sweet music made:  So in our life the different degrees  Render sweet harmony among these wheels.    \"Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,  Shines Romeo's light, whose goodly deed and fair  Met ill acceptance.  But the Provencals,  That were his foes, have little cause for mirth.  Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong  Of other's worth.  Four daughters were there born  To Raymond Berenger, and every one  Became a queen; and this for him did Romeo,  Though of mean state and from a foreign land.  Yet envious tongues incited him to ask  A reckoning of that just one, who return'd  Twelve fold to him for ten.  Aged and poor  He parted thence: and if the world did know  The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,  'T would deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt.\"          CANTO VII    \"Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth  Superillustrans claritate tua  Felices ignes horum malahoth!\"  Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright  With fourfold lustre to its orb again,  Revolving; and the rest unto their dance  With it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,  In sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.    Me doubt possess'd, and \"Speak,\" it whisper'd me,  \"Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench  Thy thirst with drops of sweetness.\"  Yet blank awe,  Which lords it o'er me, even at the sound  Of Beatrice's name, did bow me down  As one in slumber held.  Not long that mood  Beatrice suffer'd: she, with such a smile,  As might have made one blest amid the flames,  Beaming upon me, thus her words began:  \"Thou in thy thought art pond'ring (as I deem),  And what I deem is truth how just revenge  Could be with justice punish'd: from which doubt  I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;  For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.    \"That man, who was unborn, himself condemn'd,  And, in himself, all, who since him have liv'd,  His offspring: whence, below, the human kind  Lay sick in grievous error many an age;  Until it pleas'd the Word of God to come  Amongst them down, to his own person joining  The nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,  By the mere act of his eternal love.  Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.  The nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,  Created first was blameless, pure and good;  But through itself alone was driven forth  From Paradise, because it had eschew'd  The way of truth and life, to evil turn'd.  Ne'er then was penalty so just as that  Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard  The nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrong  So great, in reference to him, who took  Such nature on him, and endur'd the doom.  God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:  So different effects flow'd from one act,  And heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake.  Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear  That a just vengeance was by righteous court  Justly reveng'd.  But yet I see thy mind  By thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,  And with how vehement desire it asks  Solution of the maze.  What I have heard,  Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way  For our redemption chose, eludes my search.    \"Brother! no eye of man not perfected,  Nor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,  May fathom this decree.  It is a mark,  In sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:  And I will therefore show thee why such way  Was worthiest.  The celestial love, that spume  All envying in its bounty, in itself  With such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#4)"],[1,"have reach'd!\"       Then turning, I to them my speech address'd.  And thus began:  \"Francesca!  your sad fate  Even to tears my grief and pity moves.  But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,  By what, and how love granted, that ye knew  Your yet uncertain wishes?\"  She replied:  \"No greater grief than to remember days  Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens  Thy learn'd instructor.  Yet so eagerly  If thou art bent to know the primal root,  From whence our love gat being, I will do,  As one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day  For our delight we read of Lancelot,  How him love thrall'd.  Alone we were, and no  Suspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading  Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue  Fled from our alter'd cheek.  But at one point  Alone we fell.  When of that smile we read,  The wished smile, rapturously kiss'd  By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er  From me shall separate, at once my lips  All trembling kiss'd.  The book and writer both  Were love's purveyors.  In its leaves that day  We read no more.\"  While thus one spirit spake,  The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck  I through compassion fainting, seem'd not far  From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.        CANTO VI    MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd  With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief  O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see  New torments, new tormented souls, which way  Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.  In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs  Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd  For ever, both in kind and in degree.  Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw  Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:  Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.       Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,  Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog  Over the multitude immers'd beneath.  His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,  His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which  He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs  Piecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,  Under the rainy deluge, with one side  The other screening, oft they roll them round,  A wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm  Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd  His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb  Of him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms  Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth  Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.  E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food  His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall  His fury, bent alone with eager haste  To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks  Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns  The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.       We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt  Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet  Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.       They all along the earth extended lay  Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,  Soon as that way he saw us pass.  \"O thou!\"  He cried, \"who through the infernal shades art led,  Own, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd  Or ere my frame was broken.\"  I replied:  \"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes  Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems  As if I saw thee never.  But inform  Me who thou art, that in a place so sad  Art set, and in such torment, that although  Other be greater, more disgustful none  Can be imagin'd.\"  He in answer thus:  \"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,  Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,  Held me in brighter days.  Ye citizens  Were wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin  Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,  E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;  Nor I sole spirit in this woe:  all these  Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment.\"       No more he said, and I my speech resum'd:  \"Ciacco!  thy dire affliction grieves me much,  Even to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st,  What shall at length befall the citizens  Of the divided city;  whether any just one  Inhabit there:  and tell me of the cause,  Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?\"       He then: \"After long striving they will come  To blood; and the wild party from the woods  Will chase the other with much injury forth.  Then it behoves, that this must fall, within  Three solar circles; and the other rise  By borrow'd force of one, who under shore  Now rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof  Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight  The other oppress'd, indignant at the load,  And grieving sore.  The just are two in number,  But they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride,  Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all  On fire.\"  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;  And I continu'd thus: \"Still would I learn  More from thee, farther parley still entreat.  Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,  They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,  Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent  Their minds on working good.  Oh!  tell me where  They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.  For I am press'd with keen desire to hear,  If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell  Be to their lip assign'd.\"   He answer'd straight:  \"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes  Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.  If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.  But to the pleasant world when thou return'st,  Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.  No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.\"       This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,  A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,  And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.       When thus my guide:  \"No more his bed he leaves,  Ere the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power  Adverse to these shall then in glory come,  Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,  Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,  And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend  The vault.\"  So pass'd we through that mixture foul  Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile  Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.  For thus I question'd:  \"Shall these tortures, Sir!  When the great sentence passes, be increas'd,  Or mitigated, or as now severe?\"       He then:  \"Consult thy knowledge; that decides  That as each thing to more perfection grows,  It feels more sensibly both good and pain.  Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive  This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now  They shall approach it.\"  Compassing that path  Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse  Much more than I relate between us pass'd:  Till at the point, where the steps led below,  Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.        CANTO VII    \"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!\" loud exclaim'd  Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:  And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,  To comfort me thus spake:  \"Let not thy fear  Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none  To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.\"  Then to that sworn lip turning, \" Peace!\"  he cried,  \"Curs'd wolf!  thy fury inward on thyself  Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound  Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd  On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd  Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud.\"       As sails full spread and bellying with the wind  Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;  So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.       Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,  Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe  Hems in of all the universe.  Ah me!  Almighty Justice!  in what store thou heap'st  New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!  Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?       E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,  Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;  Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,  Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,  From one side and the other, with loud voice,  Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,  Then smote together, and each one forthwith  Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,  Exclaiming these, \"Why holdest thou so fast?\"  Those answering, \"And why castest thou away?\"  So still repeating their despiteful song,  They to the opposite point on either hand  Travers'd the horrid circle:  then arriv'd,  Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space  Conflicting met again.  At sight whereof  I, stung with grief, thus spake:  \"O say, my guide!  What race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,  On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?\"       He straight replied:  \"In their first life these all  In mind were so distorted, that they made,  According to due measure, of their wealth,  No use.  This clearly from their words collect,  Which they howl forth, at each extremity  Arriving of the circle, where their crime  Contrary' in kind disparts them.  To the church  Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls  Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom  Av'rice dominion absolute maintains.\"       I then:  \"Mid such as these some needs must be,  Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot  Of these foul sins were stain'd.\"  He answering thus:  \"Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life,  Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,  And to all knowledge indiscernible.  Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:  These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,  Those with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,  And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world  Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs  No labour'd phrase of mine to set if off.  Now may'st thou see, my son!  how brief, how vain,  The goods committed into fortune's hands,  For which the human race keep such a coil!  Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,  Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls  Might purchase rest for one.\"  I thus rejoin'd:       \"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;  This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,  Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?\"       He thus:  \"O beings blind!  what ignorance  Besets you?  Now my "]]]
