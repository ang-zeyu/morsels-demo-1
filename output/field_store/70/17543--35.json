[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#3)"],[1,"where I stood on  the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she  was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could  boast, secured apartments there. I smiled to think how surprised  George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow  travellers for so long.    I was very kindly received at the hotel--it was really no more than an  inn--kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters. They were good,  quiet people, and seemed very little interested in the great doings at  Strelsau. The old lady's hero was the duke, for he was now, under the  late King's will, master of the Zenda estates and of the Castle, which  rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so  from the inn. The old lady, indeed, did not hesitate to express regret  that the duke was not on the throne, instead of his brother.    \"We know Duke Michael,\" said she. \"He has always lived among us; every  Ruritanian knows Duke Michael. But the King is almost a stranger; he has  been so much abroad, not one in ten knows him even by sight.\"    \"And now,\" chimed in one of the young women, \"they say he has shaved off  his beard, so that no one at all knows him.\"    \"Shaved his beard!\" exclaimed her mother. \"Who says so?\"    \"Johann, the duke's keeper. He has seen the King.\"    \"Ah, yes. The King, sir, is now at the duke's hunting-lodge in the  forest here; from here he goes to Strelsau to be crowned on Wednesday  morning.\"    I was interested to hear this, and made up my mind to walk next day in  the direction of the lodge, on the chance of coming across the King. The  old lady ran on garrulously:    \"Ah, and I wish he would stay at his hunting--that and wine (and one  thing more) are all he loves, they say--and suffer our duke to be  crowned on Wednesday. That I wish, and I don't care who knows it.\"    \"Hush, mother!\" urged the daughters.    \"Oh, there's many to think as I do!\" cried the old woman stubbornly.    I threw myself back in my deep armchair, and laughed at her zeal.    \"For my part,\" said the younger and prettier of the two daughters, a  fair, buxom, smiling wench, \"I hate Black Michael! A red Elphberg for  me, mother! The King, they say, is as red as a fox or as--\"    And she laughed mischievously as she cast a glance at me, and tossed her  head at her sister's reproving face.    \"Many a man has cursed their red hair before now,\" muttered the old  lady--and I remembered James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon.    \"But never a woman!\" cried the girl.    \"Ay, and women, when it was too late,\" was the stern answer, reducing  the girl to silence and blushes.    \"How comes the King here?\" I asked, to break an embarrassed silence. \"It  is the duke's land here, you say.\"    \"The duke invited him, sir, to rest here till Wednesday. The duke is at  Strelsau, preparing the King's reception.\"    \"Then they're friends?\"    \"None better,\" said the old lady.    But my rosy damsel tossed her head again; she was not to be repressed  for long, and she broke out again:    \"Ay, they love one another as men do who want the same place and the  same wife!\"    The old woman glowered; but the last words pricked my curiosity, and I  interposed before she could begin scolding:    \"What, the same wife, too! How's that, young lady?\"    \"All the world knows that Black Michael--well then, mother, the  duke--would give his soul to marry his cousin, the Princess Flavia, and  that she is to be the queen.\"    \"Upon my word,\" said I, \"I begin to be sorry for your duke. But if a man  will be a younger son, why he must take what the elder leaves, and be  as thankful to God as he can;\" and, thinking of myself, I shrugged my  shoulders and laughed. And then I thought also of Antoinette de Mauban  and her journey to Strelsau.    \"It's little dealing Black Michael has with--\" began the girl, braving  her mother's anger; but as she spoke a heavy step sounded on the floor,  and a gruff voice asked in a threatening tone:    \"Who talks of 'Black Michael' in his Highness's own burgh?\"    The girl gave a little shriek, half of fright--half, I think, of  amusement.    \"You'll not tell of me, Johann?\" she said.    \"See where your chatter leads,\" said the old lady.    The man who had spoken came forward.    \"We have company, Johann,\" said my hostess, and the fellow plucked off  his cap. A moment later he saw me, and, to my amazement, he started back  a step, as though he had seen something wonderful.    \"What ails you, Johann?\" asked the elder girl. \"This is a gentleman on  his travels, come to see the coronation.\"    The man had recovered himself, but he was staring at me with an intense,  searching, almost fierce glance.    \"Good evening to you,\" said I.    \"Good evening, sir,\" he muttered, still scrutinizing me, and the merry  girl began to laugh as she called--    \"See, Johann, it is the colour you love! He started to see your hair,  sir. It's not the colour we see most of here in Zenda.\"    \"I crave your pardon, sir,\" stammered the fellow, with puzzled eyes. \"I  expected to see no one.\"    \"Give him a glass to drink my health in; and I'll bid you good night,  and thanks to you, ladies, for your courtesy and pleasant conversation.\"    So speaking, I rose to my feet, and with a slight bow turned to the  door. The young girl ran to light me on the way, and the man fell back  to let me pass, his eyes still fixed on me. The moment I was by, he  started a step forward, asking:    \"Pray, sir, do you know our King?\"    \"I never saw him,\" said I. \"I hope to do so on Wednesday.\"    He said no more, but I felt his eyes following me till the door closed  behind me. My saucy conductor, looking over her shoulder at me as she  preceded me upstairs, said:    \"There's no pleasing Master Johann for one of your colour, sir.\"    \"He prefers yours, maybe?\" I suggested.    \"I meant, sir, in a man,\" she answered, with a coquettish glance.    \"What,\" asked I, taking hold of the other side of the candlestick, \"does  colour matter in a man?\"    \"Nay, but I love yours--it's the Elphberg red.\"    \"Colour in a man,\" said I, \"is a matter of no more moment than  that!\"--and I gave her something of no value.    \"God send the kitchen door be shut!\" said she.    \"Amen!\" said I, and left her.    In fact, however, as I now know, colour is sometimes of considerable  moment to a man.          CHAPTER 3    A Merry Evening with a Distant Relative      I was not so unreasonable as to be prejudiced against the duke's keeper  because he disliked my complexion; and if I had been, his most civil  and obliging conduct (as it seemed to me to be) next morning would have  disarmed me. Hearing that I was bound for Strelsau, he came to see  me while I was breakfasting, and told me that a sister of his who had  married a well-to-do tradesman and lived in the capital, had invited  him to occupy a room in her house. He had gladly accepted, but now found  that his duties would not permit of his absence. He begged therefore  that, if such humble (though, as he added, clean and comfortable)  lodgings would satisfy me, I would take his place. He pledged his  sister's acquiescence, and urged the inconvenience and crowding to which  I should be subject in my journeys to and from Strelsau the next day.  I accepted his offer without a moment's hesitation, and he went off to  telegraph to his sister, while I packed up and prepared to take the next  train. But I still hankered after the forest and the hunting-lodge, and  when my little maid told me that I could, by walking ten miles or so  through the forest, hit the railway at a roadside station, I decided to  send my luggage direct to the address which Johann had given, take my  walk, and follow to Strelsau myself. Johann had gone off and was not  aware of the change in my plans; but, as its only effect was to delay  my arrival at his sister's for a few hours, there was no reason for  troubling to inform him of it. Doubtless the good lady would waste no  anxiety on my account.    I took an early luncheon, and, having bidden my kind entertainers  farewell, promising to return to them on my way home, I set out to climb  the hill that led to the Castle, and thence to the forest of Zenda.  Half an hour's leisurely walking brought me to the Castle. It had been  a fortress in old days, and the ancient keep was still in good  preservation and very imposing. Behind it stood another portion of the  original castle, and behind that again, and separated from it by a deep  and broad moat, which ran all round the old buildings, was a handsome  modern chateau, erected by the last king, and now forming the country  residence of the Duke of Strelsau. The old and the new portions were  connected by a drawbridge, and this indirect mode of access formed the  only passage between the old building and the outer world; but leading  to the modern chateau there was a broad and handsome avenue. It was an  ideal residence: when \"Black Michael\" desired company, he could dwell in  his chateau; if a fit of misanthropy seized him, he had merely to cross  the bridge and draw it up after him (it ran on rollers), and nothing  short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out. I went  on my way, glad that poor Black Michael, though he could not have the  throne or the princess, had, at least, as fine a residence as any prince  in Europe.    Soon I entered the forest, and walked on for an hour or more in its cool  sombre shade. The great trees enlaced with one another over my head, and  the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds, and  hardly bigger. I was enchanted with the place, and, finding a felled  tree-trunk, propped my back against it, and stretching my legs out gave  myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods  and to the comfort of a good cigar. And when the cigar was finished and  I had (I suppose) inhaled as much beauty as I could, I went off into  the most delightful sleep,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#3)"],[1,"my gaiters!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What is it? I hope the Happy  Harry gang hasn't robbed you again; nor Berg and his men tried to take  that treasure away from us, after we worked so hard to get it from the  wreck.\"    \"No, it isn't that,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"The truth is that Tom thinks  he has invented a storage battery that will revolutionize matters. He's  going to build an electric automobile, he says.\"    \"I am,\" declared the lad, as the others looked at him, \"and it will be  the speediest one you ever saw, too!\"          CHAPTER III    THE MOTORCYCLE WINS      \"Well, Tom,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, after a pause following the lad's  announcement. \"I didn't know you had any ambitions in that line. Tell  us more about the battery. What system do you use; lead plates and  sulphuric acid?\"    \"Oh, that's out of date long ago,\" declared the lad.    \"Well, I don't know much about electricity,\" admitted the aeronaut.  \"I'll take my chances in an airship or a balloon, but when it comes to  electricity I'm down and out.\"    \"So am I,\" admitted Mr. Damon. \"Bless my gizzard, it's all I can do to  put a new spark plug in my automobile. Where is your new battery, Tom?\"    \"Out in my shop, running yet if it hasn't been frightened by the  airship smash,\" replied the lad, somewhat proudly. \"It's an oxide of  nickel battery, with steel and oxide of iron negative electrodes.\"    \"What solution do you use, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"I didn't get that  far in questioning you before the crash came,\" he added.    \"Well I have, in the experimental battery, a solution of potassium  hydrate,\" replied the lad, \"but I think I'm going to change it, and add  some lithium hydrate to it. I think that will make it stronger.\"    \"Bless my watch chain!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"It's all Greek to me.  Suppose you let us see it, Tom? I like to see wheels go 'round, but I'm  not much of a hand for chemical terms.\"    \"If you're sure you're not hurt by the airship smash, I will,\" declared  the lad.    \"Oh, we're not hurt a bit,\" insisted Mr. Sharp. \"As I said we were  moving slow, for I knew it was about time to land. Mr. Damon was  steering--\"    \"Yes I thought I'd try my hand at it, as it seemed so easy,\"  interrupted the eccentric man. \"But never again--not for mine! I  couldn't see the house, and, before I knew it we were right over the  roof. Then the chimney seemed to stick itself up suddenly in front of  us, and--well, you know the rest. I'm willing to pay for any damage I  caused.\"    \"Oh, not at all!\" replied Tom. \"It's easy enough to put on a new plane,  or, for that matter, we can operate the Red Cloud without it. But come  on, I'll show you my sample battery.\"    \"Here, take umbrellas!\" Mrs. Baggert called after them as they started  toward the shop, for it was still raining.    \"We don't mind getting wet,\" replied the young inventor. \"It's in the  interests of science.\"    \"Maybe it is. You don't mind a wetting, but I mind you coming in and  dripping water all over the carpets!\" retorted the housekeeper.    \"Bless my overshoes, I'm afraid we have wet the carpets a trifle now,\"  admitted Mr. Damon ruefully, as he looked down at a puddle, which had  formed where he had been standing.    \"That's the reason I want you to take umbrellas this trip,\" insisted  Mrs. Baggert.    They complied, and were soon in the shop, where Tom explained his  battery. The small motor was still running and had, as the lad had  said, gone the equivalent of over two hundred miles.    \"If a small battery does as well as that, what will a larger one do?\"  asked Mr. Damon.    \"Much better, I hope,\" replied the youth. \"But Dad doesn't seem to have  much faith in them.\"    \"Well,\" admitted Mr. Swift, \"I must say I am skeptical. Still, I  acknowledge Tom has done some pretty good work along electrical lines.  He helped me with the positive and negative plates on the submarine,  and, maybe--well, we'll wait and see,\" he concluded.    \"If you build a car I hope you give me a ride in it,\" said Mr. Damon.  \"I've ridden fast in the air, and swiftly on top of, and under, the  water. Now I'd like to ride rapidly on top of the earth. The gasolene  auto doesn't go very fast.\"    \"I'll give you a ride that will make your hair stand up!\" prophesied  Tom, and the time was to come when he would make good that prediction.    The little party in the machine shop talked at some length about Tom's  battery. He showed them how it was constructed, and gave them some of  his ideas regarding the new type of auto he planned to build.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift at length, \"if you want to keep your brain  fresh, Tom, you must get to bed earlier than this. It's nearly twelve  o'clock.\"    \"And I want to get up early!\" exclaimed the lad. \"I'm going to start to  build a larger battery to-morrow.\"    \"And I'm going to repair the airship,\" added Mr. Sharp.    \"Bless my night cap, I promised my wife I'd be home early to-night,  too!\" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I don't fancy making the trip back  to Waterfield in my auto, though. Something will be sure to happen.  I'll blow out a tire, or a spark plug will get sooty on me and--\"    \"It's raining harder than ever,\" interrupted Tom. \"Better stay here  to-night. You can telephone home.\"  Which Mr. Damon did.    Tom was up early the next morning, in spite of the fact that he did not  go to bed in good season, and before breakfast he was working at his  new storage battery. After the meal he hurried back to the shop, but it  was not long before he came out, wheeling his motor-cycle.    \"Where are you going, Tom?\" asked Mrs. Baggert.    \"Oh, I've got to go to Mansburg to get some steel tubes for my new  battery,\" he replied. \"I thought I had some large enough, but I  haven't.\"  Mansburg was a good-sized town, near Shopton.    \"Then I wish you'd bring me a bottle of stove polish,\" requested the  housekeeper. \"The liquid kind. I'm out of it, and the stove is as red  as a cow.\"    \"All right,\" agreed the lad, as he leaped into the saddle and pedaled  off down the road. A moment later he had turned on the power, and was  speeding along the highway, which was in good condition on account of  the shower of the night before.    Tom was thinking so deeply of his new invention, and planning what he  would do when he had his electric runabout built, that, almost before  he knew it, he had reached Mansburg, purchased the steel tubes, and the  stove polish, and was on his way back again.    As he was speeding along on a level road, he heard, coming behind him,  an automobile. The lad turned to one side, but, in spite of this the  party in the car began a serenade of the electric siren, and kept it  up, making a wild discord.    \"What's the matter with those fellows!\" inquired Tom of himself.  \"Haven't I given them enough of the road, or has their steering gear  broken?\"    He looked back over his shoulder, and it needed but a glance to show  that the car was all right, as regarded the steering apparatus. And it  needed only another glance to disclose the reason for the shrill sound  of the siren.    \"Andy Foger!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I might have known. And Sam and Pete are  with him. Well, if he wants to make me get off the road, he'll find  that I've got as much right as he has!\"    He kept on a straight course, wondering if the red-haired, and  squint-eyed bully would dare try to damage the motor-cycle.    A little later Andy's car was beside Tom.    \"Why don't you get out of the way,\" demanded Sam, who could usually be  depended on to aid Andy in all his mean tricks.    \"Because I'm entitled to half the road,\" retorted our hero.    \"Humph! A slow-moving machine like yours hasn't any right on the road,\"  sneered Andy, who had slowed down his car somewhat.    \"I haven't, eh?\" demanded Tom. \"Well, if you'll get down out of that  car for a few minutes I'll soon show you what my rights are!\"    Now Andy, more than once, had come to personal encounters with Tom,  much to the anguish of the bully. He did not relish another  chastisement, but his mean spirit could not brook interference.    \"Don't you want a race?\" he inquired of Tom, in a sneering tone. \"I'll  give you a mile start, and beat you! I've got the fastest car built!\"    \"You have, eh?\" asked Tom, while a grim look came over his face. \"Maybe  you'll think differently some day.\"    \"Aw, he's afraid to race; come on,\" suggested Pete. \"Don't bother with  him, Andy.\"    \"No, I guess it wouldn't be worth my while,\" was the reply of the  bully, and he threw the second gear into place, and began to move away  from the young inventor.    Tom was just as much pleased to be left alone, but he did not want Andy  Foger to think that he could have matters all his own way. Tom's  motor-cycle, since he had made some adjustments to it, was very swift.  In fact there were few autos that could beat it.  He had never tried it  against Andy's new car, and he was anxious to do so.    \"I wonder if I would stand any chance, racing him?\" thought the young  inventor, as he saw the car slowly pulling away from him.  \"I think  I'll wait until he gets some distance ahead, and then I'll see how near  I can come to him. If I get anywhere near him I'm pretty sure I can  pass him. I'll try it.\"    When Andy and his cronies looked back, Tom did not appear to be doing  anything save moving along at moderate speed on his machine.    \"You don't dare race!\" Pete Bailey shouted to him.    \"Wait,\" was what Tom whispered to himself.    Andy's car was now some distance ahead. The young inventor waited a  little longer, and then turned more power into his machine. It leaped  forward and began to \"eat up the road,\" as Tom expressed it. He had  seen Andy throw in the third gear, but knew that there was a fourth  speed on the bully's car.    \"I don't know whether I can beat him on that or not,\" thought the lad  dubiously. \"If I try, and fail, they'll laugh at me. But I don't think  I'm going to fail.\"    Faster and faster he rode. He was rapidly"]]]
