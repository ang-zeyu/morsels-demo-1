[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#4)"],[1,"he fairly flew through the  forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe.  He saw them  before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed more  quietly than Tarzan of the Apes.  He saw Kamma and her mate feeding  side by side, their hairy bodies rubbing against each other.  And he  saw Teeka feeding by herself.  Not for long would she feed thus in  loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed amongst them.    There was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened snarls,  for Tarzan had surprised them; but there was more, too, than mere  nervous shock to account for the bristling neck hair which remained  standing long after the apes had discovered the identity of the  newcomer.    Tarzan noticed this as he had noticed it many times in the past--that  always his sudden coming among them left them nervous and unstrung for  a considerable time, and that they one and all found it necessary to  satisfy themselves that he was indeed Tarzan by smelling about him a  half dozen or more times before they calmed down.    Pushing through them, he made his way toward Teeka; but as he  approached her the ape drew away.    \"Teeka,\" he said, \"it is Tarzan.  You belong to Tarzan.  I have come  for you.\"    The ape drew closer, looking him over carefully.  Finally she sniffed  at him, as though to make assurance doubly sure.    \"Where is Taug?\" she asked.    \"The Gomangani have him,\" replied Tarzan.  \"They will kill him.\"    In the eyes of the she, Tarzan saw a wistful expression and a troubled  look of sorrow as he told her of Taug's fate; but she came quite close  and snuggled against him, and Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, put his arm about  her.    As he did so he noticed, with a start, the strange incongruity of that  smooth, brown arm against the black and hairy coat of his lady-love. He  recalled the paw of Sheeta's mate across Sheeta's face--no incongruity  there.  He thought of little Manu hugging his she, and how the one  seemed to belong to the other.  Even the proud male bird, with his gay  plumage, bore a close resemblance to his quieter spouse, while Numa,  but for his shaggy mane, was almost a counterpart of Sabor, the  lioness.  The males and the females differed, it was true; but not with  such differences as existed between Tarzan and Teeka.    Tarzan was puzzled.  There was something wrong.  His arm dropped from  the shoulder of Teeka.  Very slowly he drew away from her.  She looked  at him with her head cocked upon one side.  Tarzan rose to his full  height and beat upon his breast with his fists.  He raised his head  toward the heavens and opened his mouth.  From the depths of his lungs  rose the fierce, weird challenge of the victorious bull ape.  The tribe  turned curiously to eye him.  He had killed nothing, nor was there any  antagonist to be goaded to madness by the savage scream.  No, there was  no excuse for it, and they turned back to their feeding, but with an  eye upon the ape-man lest he be preparing to suddenly run amuck.    As they watched him they saw him swing into a near-by tree and  disappear from sight.  Then they forgot him, even Teeka.    Mbonga's black warriors, sweating beneath their strenuous task, and  resting often, made slow progress toward their village.  Always the  savage beast in the primitive cage growled and roared when they moved  him.  He beat upon the bars and slavered at the mouth.  His noise was  hideous.    They had almost completed their journey and were making their final  rest before forging ahead to gain the clearing in which lay their  village.  A few more minutes would have taken them out of the forest,  and then, doubtless, the thing would not have happened which did happen.    A silent figure moved through the trees above them.  Keen eyes  inspected the cage and counted the number of warriors.  An alert and  daring brain figured upon the chances of success when a certain plan  should be put to the test.    Tarzan watched the blacks lolling in the shade.  They were exhausted.  Already several of them slept.  He crept closer, pausing just above  them.  Not a leaf rustled before his stealthy advance.  He waited in  the infinite patience of the beast of prey.  Presently but two of the  warriors remained awake, and one of these was dozing.    Tarzan of the Apes gathered himself, and as he did so the black who did  not sleep arose and passed around to the rear of the cage.  The ape-boy  followed just above his head.  Taug was eyeing the warrior and emitting  low growls.  Tarzan feared that the anthropoid would awaken the  sleepers.    In a whisper which was inaudible to the ears of the Negro, Tarzan  whispered Taug's name, cautioning the ape to silence, and Taug's  growling ceased.    The black approached the rear of the cage and examined the fastenings  of the door, and as he stood there the beast above him launched itself  from the tree full upon his back.  Steel fingers circled his throat,  choking the cry which sprang to the lips of the terrified man.  Strong  teeth fastened themselves in his shoulder, and powerful legs wound  themselves about his torso.    The black in a frenzy of terror tried to dislodge the silent thing  which clung to him.  He threw himself to the ground and rolled about;  but still those mighty fingers closed more and more tightly their  deadly grip.    The man's mouth gaped wide, his swollen tongue protruded, his eyes  started from their sockets; but the relentless fingers only increased  their pressure.    Taug was a silent witness of the struggle.  In his fierce little brain  he doubtless wondered what purpose prompted Tarzan to attack the black.  Taug had not forgotten his recent battle with the ape-boy, nor the  cause of it.  Now he saw the form of the Gomangani suddenly go limp.  There was a convulsive shiver and the man lay still.    Tarzan sprang from his prey and ran to the door of the cage.  With  nimble fingers he worked rapidly at the thongs which held the door in  place.  Taug could only watch--he could not help.  Presently Tarzan  pushed the thing up a couple of feet and Taug crawled out.  The ape  would have turned upon the sleeping blacks that he might wreak his pent  vengeance; but Tarzan would not permit it.    Instead, the ape-boy dragged the body of the black within the cage and  propped it against the side bars.  Then he lowered the door and made  fast the thongs as they had been before.    A happy smile lighted his features as he worked, for one of his  principal diversions was the baiting of the blacks of Mbonga's village.  He could imagine their terror when they awoke and found the dead body  of their comrade fast in the cage where they had left the great ape  safely secured but a few minutes before.    Tarzan and Taug took to the trees together, the shaggy coat of the  fierce ape brushing the sleek skin of the English lordling as they  passed through the primeval jungle side by side.    \"Go back to Teeka,\" said Tarzan.  \"She is yours.  Tarzan does not want  her.\"    \"Tarzan has found another she?\" asked Taug.    The ape-boy shrugged.    \"For the Gomangani there is another Gomangani,\" he said; \"for Numa, the  lion, there is Sabor, the lioness; for Sheeta there is a she of his own  kind; for Bara, the deer; for Manu, the monkey; for all the beasts and  the birds of the jungle is there a mate.  Only for Tarzan of the Apes  is there none.  Taug is an ape.  Teeka is an ape.  Go back to Teeka.  Tarzan is a man.  He will go alone.\"                                       2                     The Capture of Tarzan    THE BLACK WARRIORS labored in the humid heat of the jungle's stifling  shade.  With war spears they loosened the thick, black loam and the  deep layers of rotting vegetation.  With heavy-nailed fingers they  scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center of the age-old  game trail.  Often they ceased their labors to squat, resting and  gossiping, with much laughter, at the edge of the pit they were digging.    Against the boles of near-by trees leaned their long, oval shields of  thick buffalo hide, and the spears of those who were doing the  scooping.  Sweat glistened upon their smooth, ebon skins, beneath which  rolled rounded muscles, supple in the perfection of nature's  uncontaminated health.    A reed buck, stepping warily along the trail toward water, halted as a  burst of laughter broke upon his startled ears.  For a moment he stood  statuesque but for his sensitively dilating nostrils; then he wheeled  and fled noiselessly from the terrifying presence of man.    A hundred yards away, deep in the tangle of impenetrable jungle, Numa,  the lion, raised his massive head.  Numa had dined well until almost  daybreak and it had required much noise to awaken him.  Now he lifted  his muzzle and sniffed the air, caught the acrid scent spoor of the  reed buck and the heavy scent of man.  But Numa was well filled.  With  a low, disgusted grunt he rose and slunk away.    Brilliantly plumaged birds with raucous voices darted from tree to  tree.  Little monkeys, chattering and scolding, swung through the  swaying limbs above the black warriors.  Yet they were alone, for the  teeming jungle with all its myriad life, like the swarming streets of a  great metropolis, is one of the loneliest spots in God's great universe.    But were they alone?    Above them, lightly balanced upon a leafy tree limb, a gray-eyed youth  watched with eager intentness their every move.  The fire of hate,  restrained, smoldered beneath the lad's evident desire to know the  purpose of the black men's labors.  Such a one as these it was who had  slain his beloved Kala.  For them there could be naught but enmity, yet  he liked well to watch them, avid as he was for greater knowledge of  the ways of man.    He saw the pit grow in depth until a great hole yawned the width of the  trail--a hole which was amply large enough to hold at one time all of  the six excavators.  Tarzan could not guess the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#4)"],[1," into a saddle it  ain't for pleasure--it's to get somewhere.\"    His voice was surprisingly pleasant. He spoke very deliberately, so  that one felt occasionally that he was pausing to find the right words.  And, in addition to the quality of that deep voice, he had an  impersonal way of looking his interlocutor squarely in the eye, a habit  that pleased the men of the mountain desert. On this occasion his  companion responded at once with a grin. He was a younger man than  Riley Sinclair, but he gave an impression of as much hardness as Riley  himself.    \"Maybe you'll be sliding out of the saddle for a minute?\" he asked.  \"Got some pretty fair hooch in the house.\"    \"Thanks, partner, but I'm due over to Sour Creek by night. I guess  that's Sour Creek over the hill?\"    \"Yep. New to these parts?\"    \"Sort of new.\"    Riley's noncommittal attitude was by no means displeasing to the larger  man. His rather brutally handsome face continued to light, as if he  were recognizing in Riley Sinclair a man of his own caliber.    \"You're from yonder?\"    \"Across the mountains.\"    \"You travel light.\"    His eyes were running over Riley's meager equipment. Sinclair had been  known to strike across the desert loaded with nothing more than a  rifle, ammunition, and water. Other things were nonessentials to him,  and it was hardly likely that he would put much extra weight on a  horse. The only concession to animal comfort, in fact, was the slicker  rolled snugly behind the saddle. He was one of those rare Westerners to  whom coffee on the trail is not the staff of life. As long as he had a  gun he could get meat, and as long as he could get meat, he cared  little about other niceties of diet. On a long trip his \"extras\" were  usually confined to a couple of bags of strength-giving grain for his  horse.    \"Maybe you'd know the gent I'm down here looking for?\" asked Riley.  \"Happen to know Ollie Quade--Oliver Quade?\"    \"Sort of know him, yep.\"    Riley went on explaining blandly \"You see, I'm carrying him a sort of a  death message.\"    \"H'm,\" said the big man, and he watched Riley, his eyes grown suddenly  alert, his glance shifting from hand to face with catlike uncertainty.    \"Yep,\" resumed Sinclair in a rambling vein. \"I come from a gent that  used to be a pal of his. Name is Sam Lowrie.\"    \"Sam Lowrie!\" exclaimed the other. \"You a friend of Sam's?\"    \"I was the only gent with him when he died,\" said Sinclair simply.    \"Dead!\" said the other heavily. \"Sam dead!\"    \"You must of been pretty thick with him,\" declared Riley.    \"Man, I'm Quade. Lowrie was my bunkie!\"    He came close to Sinclair, raising an eager face. \"How'd Lowrie go  out?\"    \"Pretty peaceful--boots off--everything comfortable.\"    \"He give you a message for me?\"    \"Yep, about a gent called Sinclair--Hal Sinclair, I think it was.\"  Immediately he turned his eyes away, as if he were striving to  recollect accurately. Covertly he sent a side glance at Quade and found  him scowling suspiciously. When he turned his head again, his eye was  as clear as the eye of a child. \"Yep,\" he said, \"that was the name--Hal  Sinclair.\"    \"What about Hal Sinclair?\" asked Quade gruffly.    \"Seems like Sinclair was on Lowrie's conscience,\" said Riley in the  same unperturbed voice.    \"You don't say so!\"    \"I'll tell you what he told me. Maybe he was just raving, for he had a  sort of fever before he went out. He said that you and him and Hal  Sinclair and Bill Sandersen all went out prospecting. You got stuck  clean out in the desert, Lowrie said, and you hit for water. Then  Sinclair's hoss busted his leg in a hole. The fall smashed up  Sinclair's foot. The four of you went on, Sinclair riding one hoss, and  the rest of you taking turns with the third one. Without water the  hosses got weak, and you gents got pretty badly scared, Lowrie said.  Finally you and Sandersen figured that Sinclair had got to get off, but  Sinclair couldn't walk. So the three of you made up your minds to leave  him and make a dash for water. You got to water, all right, and in  three hours you went back for Sinclair. But he'd given up hope and shot  himself, sooner'n die of thirst, Lowrie said.\"    The horrible story came slowly from the lips of Riley Sinclair. There  was not the slightest emotion in his face until Quade rubbed his  knuckles across his wet forehead. Then there was the faintest jutting  out of Riley's jaw.    \"Lowrie was sure raving,\" said Quade.    Sinclair looked carelessly down at the gray face of Quade. \"I guess  maybe he was, but what he asked me to say was: 'Hell is sure coming to  what you boys done.'\"    \"He thought about that might late,\" replied Quade. \"Waited till he  could shift the blame on me and Sandersen, eh? To hell with Lowrie!\"    \"Maybe he's there, all right,\" said Sinclair, shrugging. \"But I've got  rid of the yarn, anyway.\"    \"Are you going to spread that story around in Sour Creek?\" asked Quade  softly.    \"Me? Why, that story was told me confidential by a gent that was about  to go out!\"    Riley's frank manner disarmed Quade in a measure.    \"Kind of queer, me running on to you like this, ain't it?\" he went on.  \"Well, you're fixed up sort of comfortable up here. Nice little shack,  partner. And I suppose you got a wife and kids and everything? Pretty  lucky, I'd call you!\"    Quade was glad of an opportunity to change the subject. \"No wife yet!\"  he said.    \"Living up here all alone?\"    \"Sure! Why?\"    \"Nothing! Thought maybe you'd find it sort of lonesome.\"    Back to the dismissed subject Quade returned, with the persistence of a  guilty conscience. \"Say,\" he said, \"while we're talking about it, you  don't happen to believe what Lowrie said?\"    \"Lowrie was pretty sick; maybe he was raving. So you're all along up  here? Nobody near?\"    His restless, impatient eye ran over the surroundings. There was not a  soul in sight. The mountains were growing stark and black against the  flush of the western sky. His glance fell back upon Quade.    \"But how did Lowrie happen to die?\"    \"He got shot.\"    \"Did a gang drop him?\"    \"Nope, just one gent.\"    \"You don't say! But Lowrie was a pretty slick hand with a gun--next to  Bill Sandersen, the best I ever seen, almost! Somebody got the drop on  him, eh?\"    \"Nope, he killed himself!\"    Quade gasped. \"Suicide?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"How come?\"    \"I'll tell you how it was. He seen a gent coming. In fact he looked out  of the window of his hotel and seen Riley Sinclair, and he figured that  Riley had come to get him for what happened to his brother, Hal. Lowrie  got sort of excited, lost his nerve, and when the hotel keeper come  upstairs, Lowrie thought it was Sinclair, and he didn't wait. He shot  himself.\"    \"You seem to know a pile,\" said Quade thoughtfully.    \"Well, you see, I'm Riley Sinclair.\" Still he smiled, but Quade was as  one who had seen a ghost.    \"I had to make sure that you was alone. I had to make sure that you was  guilty. And you are, Quade. Don't do that!\"    The hand of Quade slipped around the butt of his gun and clung there.    \"You ain't fit for a gun fight right now,\" went on Riley Sinclair  slowly. \"You're all shaking, Quade, and you couldn't hit the side of  the mountain, let alone me. Wait a minute. Take your time. Get all  settled down and wait till your hand stops shaking.\"    Quade moistened his white lips and waited.    \"You give Hal plenty of time,\" resumed Riley Sinclair. \"Since Lowrie  told me that yarn I been wondering how Hal felt when you and the other  two left him alone. You know, a gent can do some pretty stiff thinking  before he makes up his mind to blow his head off.\"    His tone was quite conversational.    \"Queer thing how I come to blunder into all this information, partner.  I come into a room where Lowrie was. The minute he heard my name he  figured I was after him on account of Hal. Up he comes with his gun  like a flash. Afterward he told me all about it, and I give him a  pretty fine funeral. I'll do the same by you, Quade. How you feeling  now?\"    \"Curse you!\" exclaimed Quade.    \"Maybe I'm cursed, right enough, but, Quade, I'd let 'em burn me, inch  by inch in a fire, before I'd quit a partner, a bunkie in the desert!  You hear? It's a queer thing that a gent could have much pleasure out  of plugging another gent full of lead. I've had that pleasure once; and  I'm going to have it again. I'm going to kill you, Quade, but I wish  there was a slower way! Pull your gun!\"    That last came out with a snap, and the revolver of Quade flicked out  of its holster with a convulsive jerk of the big man's wrist. Yet the  spit of fire came from Riley Sinclair's weapon, slipping smoothly into  his hand. Quade did not fall. He stood with a bewildered expression, as  a man trying to remember something hidden far in the past; and Sinclair  fingered the butt of his gun lightly and waited. It was rather a  crumbling than a fall. The big body literally slumped down into a heap.    Sinclair reached down without dismounting and pulled the body over on  its back.    \"Because,\" he explained to what had been a strong man the moment  before, \"when the devil comes to you, I want the old boy to see your  face, Quade! Git on, old boss!\"    As he rode down the trail toward Sour Creek he carefully and deftly  cleaned his revolver and reloaded the empty chamber.          4      Perhaps, in the final analysis, Riley Sinclair would not be condemned  for the death of Lowrie or the killing of Quade, but for singing on the  trail to Sour Creek. And sing he did, his voice ringing from hill to  hill, and the echoes barking back to him, now and again.    He was not silent until he came to Sour Creek. At the head of the long,  winding, single street he drew the mustang to a tired walk. It was a  very peaceful moment in the little town Yonder a dog barked and a  coyote howled a thin answer far away, but, aside from these, all other  sounds were the happy noises of families at the end of a "]]]
