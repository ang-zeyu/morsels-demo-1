[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#4)"],[1,"the great universal laws  which rule all life. War is a biological necessity of the first  importance, a regulative element in the life of mankind which cannot be  dispensed with, since without it an unhealthy development will follow,  which excludes every advancement of the race, and therefore all real  civilization. \"War is the father of all things.\" [A] The sages of  antiquity long before Darwin recognized this.    [Footnote A: (Heraclitus of Ephesus).]    The struggle for existence is, in the life of Nature, the basis of all  healthy development. All existing things show themselves to be the  result of contesting forces. So in the life of man the struggle is not  merely the destructive, but the life-giving principle. \"To supplant or  to be supplanted is the essence of life,\" says Goethe, and the strong  life gains the upper hand. The law of the stronger holds good  everywhere. Those forms survive which are able to procure themselves the  most favourable conditions of life, and to assert themselves in the  universal economy of Nature. The weaker succumb. This struggle is  regulated and restrained by the unconscious sway of biological laws and  by the interplay of opposite forces. In the plant world and the animal  world this process is worked out in unconscious tragedy. In the human  race it is consciously carried out, and regulated by social ordinances.  The man of strong will and strong intellect tries by every means to  assert himself, the ambitious strive to rise, and in this effort the  individual is far from being guided merely by the consciousness of  right. The life-work and the life-struggle of many men are determined,  doubtless, by unselfish and ideal motives, but to a far greater extent  the less noble passions--craving for possessions, enjoyment and honour,  envy and the thirst for revenge--determine men's actions. Still more  often, perhaps, it is the need to live which brings down even natures of  a higher mould into the universal struggle for existence and enjoyment.    There can be no doubt on this point. The nation is made up of  individuals, the State of communities. The motive which influences each  member is prominent in the whole body. It is a persistent struggle for  possessions, power, and sovereignty, which primarily governs the  relations of one nation to another, and right is respected so far only  as it is compatible with advantage. So long as there are men who have  human feelings and aspirations, so long as there are nations who strive  for an enlarged sphere of activity, so long will conflicting interests  come into being and occasions for making war arise.    \"The natural law, to which all laws of Nature can be reduced, is the law  of struggle. All intrasocial property, all thoughts, inventions, and  institutions, as, indeed, the social system itself, are a result of the  intrasocial struggle, in which one survives and another is cast out. The  extrasocial, the supersocial, struggle which guides the external  development of societies, nations, and races, is war. The internal  development, the intrasocial struggle, is man's daily work--the struggle  of thoughts, feelings, wishes, sciences, activities. The outward  development, the supersocial struggle, is the sanguinary struggle of  nations--war. In what does the creative power of this struggle consist?  In growth and decay, in the victory of the one factor and in the defeat  of the other! This struggle is a creator, since it eliminates.\" [B]    [Footnote B: Clauss Wagner, \"Der Krieg als schaffendes Weltprinzip.\"]    That social system in which the most efficient personalities possess the  greatest influence will show the greatest vitality in the intrasocial  struggle. In the extrasocial struggle, in war, that nation will conquer  which can throw into the scale the greatest physical, mental, moral,  material, and political power, and is therefore the best able to defend  itself. War will furnish such a nation with favourable vital conditions,  enlarged possibilities of expansion and widened influence, and thus  promote the progress of mankind; for it is clear that those intellectual  and moral factors which insure superiority in war are also those which  render possible a general progressive development. They confer victory  because the elements of progress are latent in them. Without war,  inferior or decaying races would easily choke the growth of healthy  budding elements, and a universal decadence would follow. \"War,\" says A.  W. von Schlegel, \"is as necessary as the struggle of the elements in  Nature.\"    Now, it is, of course, an obvious fact that a peaceful rivalry may exist  between peoples and States, like that between the fellow-members of a  society, in all departments of civilized life--a struggle which need not  always degenerate Into war. Struggle and war are not identical. This  rivalry, however, does not take place under the same conditions as the  intrasocial struggle, and therefore cannot lead to the same results.  Above the rivalry of individuals and groups within the State stands the  law, which takes care that injustice is kept within bounds, and that the  right shall prevail. Behind the law stands the State, armed with power,  which it employs, and rightly so, not merely to protect, but actively to  promote, the moral and spiritual interests of society. But there is no  impartial power that stands above the rivalry of States to restrain  injustice, and to use that rivalry with conscious purpose to promote the  highest ends of mankind. Between States the only check on injustice is  force, and in morality and civilization each people must play its own  part and promote its own ends and ideals. If in doing so it comes into  conflict with the ideals and views of other States, it must either  submit and concede the precedence to the rival people or State, or  appeal to force, and face the risk of the real struggle--i.e., of  war--in order to make its own views prevail. No power exists which can  judge between States, and makes its judgments prevail. Nothing, in fact,  is left but war to secure to the true elements of progress the  ascendancy over the spirits of corruption and decay.    It will, of course, happen that several weak nations unite and form a  superior combination in order to defeat a nation which in itself is  stronger. This attempt will succeed for a time, but in the end the more  intensive vitality will prevail. The allied opponents have the seeds of  corruption in them, while the powerful nation gains from a temporary  reverse a new strength which procures for it an ultimate victory over  numerical superiority. The history of Germany is an eloquent example of  this truth.    Struggle is, therefore, a universal law of Nature, and the instinct of  self-preservation which leads to struggle is acknowledged to be a  natural condition of existence. \"Man is a fighter.\" Self-sacrifice is a  renunciation of life, whether in the existence of the individual or in  the life of States, which are agglomerations of individuals. The first  and paramount law is the assertion of one's own independent existence.  By self-assertion alone can the State maintain the conditions of life  for its citizens, and insure them the legal protection which each man is  entitled to claim from it. This duty of self-assertion is by no means  satisfied by the mere repulse of hostile attacks; it includes the  obligation to assure the possibility of life and development to the  whole body of the nation embraced by the State.    Strong, healthy, and flourishing nations increase in numbers. From a  given moment they require a continual expansion of their frontiers, they  require new territory for the accommodation of their surplus population.  Since almost every part of the globe is inhabited, new territory must,  as a rule, be obtained at the cost of its possessors--that is to say,  by conquest, which thus becomes a law of necessity.    The right of conquest is universally acknowledged. At first the  procedure is pacific. Over-populated countries pour a stream of  emigrants into other States and territories. These submit to the  legislature of the new country, but try to obtain favourable conditions  of existence for themselves at the cost of the original inhabitants,  with whom they compete. This amounts to conquest.    The right of colonization is also recognized. Vast territories inhabited  by uncivilized masses are occupied by more highly civilized States, and  made subject to their rule. Higher civilization and the correspondingly  greater power are the foundations of the right to annexation. This right  is, it is true, a very indefinite one, and it is impossible to determine  what degree of civilization justifies annexation and subjugation. The  impossibility of finding a legitimate limit to these international  relations has been the cause of many wars. The subjugated nation does  not recognize this right of subjugation, and the more powerful civilized  nation refuses to admit the claim of the subjugated to independence.  This situation becomes peculiarly critical when the conditions of  civilization have changed in the course of time. The subject nation has,  perhaps, adopted higher methods and conceptions of life, and the  difference in civilization has consequently lessened. Such a state of  things is growing ripe in British India.    Lastly, in all times the right of conquest by war has been admitted. It  may be that a growing people cannot win colonies from uncivilized races,  and yet the State wishes to retain the surplus population which the  mother-country can no longer feed. Then the only course left is to  acquire the necessary territory by war. Thus the instinct of  self-preservation leads inevitably to war, and the conquest of foreign  soil. It is not the possessor, but the victor, who then has the right.  The threatened people will see the point of Goethe's lines:      \"That which them didst inherit from thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#4)"],[1," more or less curved and frequently crossing a vein.  The large spleenworts including Lady Fern. _Athyrium_.          DESCRIPTIVE TEXT OF THE FERNS      In this manual our native ferns are grouped scientifically under five  distinct families. By far the largest of these groups, and the first to be  treated, is that of the _real ferns (Polypodiaceae)_ with sixty species and  several chief varieties. Then follow the _flowering ferns (Osmundaceae)_  with three species; the _curly grass_ and _climbing ferns (Schizaeaceae)_  with two species; the _adder's tongue_ and _grape ferns (Ophioglossaceae)_  with seven species; and the _filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae)_ with one  species.    Corresponding with these five families, the sporangia or spore cases of  ferns have five quite distinct forms on which the families are founded.    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    1. The Fern Family proper (_Polypodiaceae_) has the spore cases stalked and  bound by a vertical, elastic ring (Fig. 1). The clusters of fruit-dots  containing the spore cases may be open and naked as in polypody (Fig. 2),  or covered by an indusium, as in the shield ferns (Fig. 3).    2. The Royal Fern Family (_Osmunda_) has the spore cases stalked with only  a rudimentary ring on one side, which opens longitudinally (Fig. 4).    3. The Climbing Fern Family (_Lygodium, Schizaea_) has the spore cases  sessile in rows; they are small, nut-like bodies with the elastic ring  around the upper portion (Fig. 5).[1]    [Footnote 1: These figures are enlarged.]    4. The Adder's Tongue Family (_Ophioglossum, Botrychium_) has simple spore  cases without a ring, and discharges its spores through a transverse slit  (Fig. 6).    5. The Filmy Fern Family (_Trichomanes_) has the spore cases along  a bristle-like receptacle and surrounded by an urn-shaped, slightly  two-lipped involucre; ring transverse and opening vertically (Fig. 7).    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    [Illustration: Fig. 7]          THE FERN FAMILY PROPER OR REAL FERNS    _POLYPODIACEAE_      Green, leafy plants whose spores are borne in spore-cases (sporangia),  which are collected in dots or clusters (fruit-dots or sori) on the back  of the frond or form lines along the edge of its divisions. Sporangia  surrounded by vertical, elastic rings bursting transversely and scattering  the spores. Fruit-dots (sori) often covered, at least when young, by a  membrane called the indusium. Spores brown.      THE POLYPODIES    1. POLYPODY. _Polypodium_    (From the Greek meaning many-footed, alluding to the branching rootstocks.)    Simple ferns with stipes articulated to the creeping rootstocks, which are  covered with brown, chaffy scales. Fruit-dots round, naked, arranged on the  back of the frond in one or more rows each side of the midrib. Sporangia  pedicelled, provided with a vertical ring which bursts transversely. A  large genus with about 350 species, widely distributed, mostly in tropical  regions.    (1) COMMON POLYPODY. _Polypodium vulgare_    Fronds somewhat leathery in texture, evergreen, four to ten inches tall,  smooth, oblong, and nearly pinnate. The large fruit-dots nearly midway  between the midrib and the margin, but nearer the margin.    [Illustration: Common Polypody. _Polypodium vulgare_]    Common everywhere on cliffs, usually in half shade, and may at times spring  out of decaying logs or the trunks of trees. As the jointed stipes, harking  back to some ancient mode of fern growth, fall away from the rootstocks  after their year of greenness, they leave behind a scar as in Solomon's  seal. The polypody is a gregarious plant. By intertwining its roots the  fronds cling together in \"cheerful community,\" and a friendly eye discovers  their beauty a long way off. August. Abounds in every clime, including  Europe and Japan.    In transplanting, sections should be cut, not pulled from the matted mass.    Var. _cambricum_ has segments broader and more or less strongly toothed.    Var. _cristatum_ has the segments forked at the ends.    Several other forms are also found.    [Illustration: Fruited Frond]    [Illustration: The Common Polypody. _Polypodium vulgare_ (Photographed by  Miles Greenwood, Melrose, Mass.)]    (2) GRAY OR HOARY POLYPODY    _Polypodium incanum. P. polypodioides_    Fronds oblong, two to seven inches long, deeply pinnatifid, gray and scurfy  underneath with peltate scales having a dark center. Fruit-dots rather  small, near the margin and obscured by the chaff.    [Illustration: Gray or Hoary Polypody. _Polypodium incanum_]    In appearance the gray polypody is much like the common species, as the  Greek ending _oides_ (like) implies. In Florida and neighboring states it  often grows on trees; farther north mostly on rocks. Reported as far north  as Staten Island. It is one of the \"resurrection\" ferns, reviving quickly  by moisture after seeming to be dead from long drouth. July to September.  Widely distributed in tropical America. Often called Tree-Polypody.          THE BRACKEN GROUP      Sporangia near or on the margin of the segments, the reflexed portions of  which serve as indusia.      1. BRACKEN OR BRAKE    _Pteris aquilina_. PTERIDIUM LATIUSCULUM[1]    [Footnote 1: The use of small capitals in the scientific names indicates in  part the newer nomenclature which many botanists are inclined to adopt.]    Fronds broadly triangular, ternate, one to three feet high or more, the  widely spreading branches twice pinnate, the lower pinnules more or less  pinnatifid. Sporangia borne in a continuous line along the lower margin  of the ultimate divisions whose reflexed edges form the indusium. (Greek,  _pteron_, a wing, the feathery fronds suggesting the wings of a bird.)    [Illustration: Common Bracken or Brake, a Sterile Frond. _Pteris aquilina_  (Providence County, R.I.)]    [Illustration: A Fertile Frond of Common Bracken. _Pteris aquilina_  (Suffolk County, Mass.)]      \"The heath this night must be my bed,    The bracken curtain for my head.\"    SCOTT.    The outlines of the young bracken resemble the little oak fern. It  flourishes in thickets and open pastures, often with poor soil and scant  shade. It is found in all parts of the world, and is said to be the most  common of all our North American ferns. In a cross section of the mature  stipe superstition sees \"the devil's hoof\" and \"King Charles in the oak,\"  and any one may see or think he sees the outlines of an oak tree. It was  the bracken, or eagle fern, as some call it, which was supposed to bear the  mysterious \"fern seed,\" but only on midsummer eve (St. John's eve).      \"But on St. John's mysterious night,    Confest the mystic fern seed fell.\"    This enabled its possessor to walk invisible.      \"We have the receipt for fern-seed,    We walk invisible.\"  SHAKESPEARE.      The word brake or bracken is one of the many plant names from which some of  our English surnames are derived, as Brack, Breck, Brackenridge, etc.,  and fern (meaning the bracken) is seen in Fern, Fearns, Fernham, Fernel,  Fernside, Farnsworth, etc. Also, in names of places as Ferney, Ferndale,  Fernwood, and others. Although the bracken is coarse and common, it makes a  desirable background for rockeries, or other fern masses. The young ferns  should be transplanted in early spring with as much of the long, running  rootstock as possible.    Var. _pseudocaudata_ has longer, narrower and more distant pinnules, and is  a common southern form.    [Illustration: Var. _pseudocaudata_]        2. MAIDENHAIR. _Adiantum_    Ferns with much divided leaves and short, marginal sori borne at the ends  of free-forking veins, on the under side of the reflexed and altered  portion of the pinnules, which serves as an indusium. Stipes and branches  of the leaves very slender and polished.    (Greek, unwetted, because drops of water roll off without wetting the  leaves.)    (1) COMMON MAIDENHAIR. _Adiantum pedatum_    A graceful fern of shady glen and rocky woodland, nine to eighteen inches  high, the black, shining stalks forked at the top into two equal,  recurved branches, the pinnae all springing from the upper side. Pinnules  triangular-oblong, bearing short sori on their inwardly reflexed margins  which form the indusium.    [Illustration: A Spray of Maidenhair]    [Illustration: Fruiting Pinnae of Maidenhair]    The maidenhair has a superficial resemblance to the meadow rue, which also  sheds water, but it may be known at once by its black, shining stalks with  their divisions all borne on one side. It is indeed a most delicate fern,  known and admired by every one. The term maidenhair may have been suggested  by the black, wiry roots growing from the slender rootstock, or by the  dark, polished stems, or, as Clute explains it, \"because the black roots,  like hair, were supposed, according to the 'doctrine of signatures' to be  good for falling hair, and the plant was actually used in the 'syrup of  capillaire'[A] (_Am. Botanist_, November, 1921). While the maidenhair is  not very common, it is widely distributed, being found throughout our  section, westward to California, and northward to the British Provinces.    \"Though the maidenhair has a wide range, and grows abundantly in many  localities, it possesses a quality of aloofness which adds to its charm.  Its chosen haunts are dim, moist hollows in the woods, or shaded hillsides  sloping to the river. In such retreats you find the feathery fronds  tremulous on their glistening stalks, and in their neighborhood you find,  also, the very spirit of the woods.\"      MRS. PARSONS.    [Footnote A: It may be stated that capillaire syrup besides the use here  indicated was highly esteemed as a pectoral for the relief of difficult  breathing.]    [Illustration: Common Maidenhair. _Adiantum pedatum_ (Reading, Mass.,  Kingman)]    [Illustration: Alpine Maidenhair. _Adiantum pedatum_, Var. _aleuticum_  (Fernald and"]]]
