Mr. Humphreys thus graphically describes the style of the fourteenth  century:--        \"It was a great artistic era--the architecture, the painting,      the goldsmith's work, the elaborate productions in enamel, and      the illuminator's art, were in beautiful harmony, being each      founded upon similar principles of design and composition;      even the art of writing lending itself to complete the chord      of artistic harmony, by adopting that, crisp and angular      feeling which the then general use of the pointed arch      introduced into all works of artistic combination.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE PHANTOM WORLD.[1]    MR. CHRISTMAS, in his \"Twin Giants,\" attacked the stronghold of  popular superstition by exhibiting the foundations and growth of error  in the early and ignorant ages, and of the progressive dissipation of  these delusions as the light of history and science spread over the  world. The present work is a translation from Calmet. It deals with  spectres, vampyres, and all that tribe of visionary monsters. We have  here the learning and opinion of the enlightened portion of the world  a century ago. M. Calmet traversed all history for his facts, and  gives us a mass of monkish inventions, which prove to what an extent  the Romish church fostered superstition for its own purposes. We have  dead men called from their graves to show the danger of neglecting  to pay tithes, and to rivet on the rich the necessity of building  churches, and paying liberally for masses. At p. 286 of vol. 1 we  have a proof that the \"knockings\" which have made so much noise in  the United States, are no novelty:--        \"Humbert Birk, a burgess of note in the town of Oppenheim,      had a country-house, called Berenbach. He died in the month      of November, 1620, a few days before the feast of St. Martin.      On the Saturday which followed his funeral they began to      hear certain noises in the house where he had lived with his      first wife; for at the time of his death he had married      again. The master of this house, suspecting that it was his      brother-in-law who haunted it, said to him: 'If you are      Humbert, my brother-in-law, strike three times against the      wall.' At the same time they heard three strokes only, for      ordinarily he struck several times. Sometimes, also, he      was heard at the fountain where they went for water, and he      frightened all the neighborhood. He did not utter articulate      sounds; but he would knock repeatedly, make a noise, or      a groan or a shrill whistle, or sounds as of a person in      lamentation.\"    This went on, at intervals, for a year, when the ghost found a voice,  and told them to tell the cure to come there; and when he came he said  he wanted three masses said for him, and alms given to the poor. The  author has the following sensible observations on the modes in which  ghost stories originate:--        \"We call to our assistance the artifices of the charlatans,      who do so many things which pass for supernatural in the eyes      of the ignorant. Philosophers, by means of certain glasses,      and what are called magic lanterns; by optical secrets,      sympathetic powders: by their phosphorus, and, lately, by      means of the electric machine, show us an infinite number of      things which the simpletons take for magic, because they know      not how they are produced. Eyes that are diseased do not see      things as others see them, or else behold them differently.      A drunken man will see objects double; to one who has the      jaundice they will appear yellow: in the obscurity people      fancy they see a spectre, where there is but the trunk of a      tree.        \"A mountebank will appear to eat a sword; mother will vomit      coals, or pebbles. One will drink wine, and send it out again      at his forehead; another will cut off his companion's head,      and put it on again. You will think you see a chicken dragging      a beam. The mountebank will swallow fire, and vomit it forth;      he will draw blood from fruit; he will send from his mouth      strings of iron nails; he will put a sword on his stomach, and      press it strongly, and instead of running into him, it will      bend back to the hilt. Another will run a sword through his      body without wounding himself. You will sometimes see a child      without a head, then a head without a child and all of them      alive. That appears very wonderful; nevertheless, if it were      known how all these things are done, people would only laugh,      and be surprised that they could wonder at and admire such      things.\"    If we are so easily deceived in these matters, is it strange that in  peculiar states of mind or body, we are so completely imposed on in  others? At p. 353 we have the story on which Goethe has founded a  singular exploit of Mephistopheles in the cellar of Auerbach.        \"John Faust Cudlington, a German, was requested, in a company      of gay people, to perform in their presence some tricks of      his trade. He promised to show them a vine loaded with grapes,      ripe and ready to gather. They thought, as it was the month      of December, he could not execute his promise. He strongly      recommended them not to stir from their places, and not to      lift up their hands to cut the grapes, unless by his express      order. The vine appeared directly, covered with leaves and      loaded with grapes, to the astonishment of all present. Every      one took up his knife, awaiting the order of Cudlington to      cut some grapes; but after having kept them some time in that      expectation, he suddenly caused the vine and the grapes to      disappear. Then every one found himself armed with his knife,      and holding his neighbor's nose with one hand; so that if      they had cut off a bunch without the order of Cudlington, they      would have cut off one another's noses.\"    The book is curious and interesting and calculated to do away with  much of the superstition which now appears to be gaining ground in  almost every part of Christendom.

George Sand, as elsewhere noted, has written her \"Confessions,\" in the  style of Rousseau, and a Paris bookseller has contracted to give her  a fortune for them. The three greatest--intellectually greatest--women  of modern times have lived in France and it is remarkable that they  have been three of the most shamelessly profligate in all history. The  worst of these, probably--Madame de Stael--left us no records of her  long-continued, disgusting, and almost incredible licentiousness, so  remarkable that Chateaubriand deemed her the most abandoned person in  France at a period when modesty was publicly derided in the Assembly  as a mere \"system of refined voluptuousness.\" Few who have lately  resided in Paris are ignorant of the gross sensualism of the  astonishing Rachel, whose genius, though displayed in no permanent  forms, is not less than that of the Shakspeare of her sex, the  forever-to-be-famous Madame Dudevant, whose immoralities of conduct  have perhaps been overdrawn, while those of De Stael and Rachel have  rarely been spoken of save where they challenged direct observation.  We perceive that Rachel is to be in New York next autumn, with a  company of French actors.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. G.P.R.

We have it  from the best authority that Mr. James does not intend in any way  whatever to meddle with the copyright question, and that he will  not write a book about us on his return to England. He visits the  United States for a season's agreeable relaxation, with his family,  comprising his wife and daughter and three sons. The London _Morning  Chronicle_, in a review of one of his recent compositions, has  the following piece of criticism, in contemplation of the present  interruption of Mr. James's labors:--        \"A season without two or three novels from Mr. James would      be a marked year in the world of letters. There is not a      power-loom in all Manchester which works with more untiring,      unswerving regularity. Does Mr. James ever stop to think,      to eat, to drink, to sleep? Is he ever sick? Has he ever a      headache? Is he ever out of sorts, even as other men are, when      they turn away from the inkstand as from a bottle of physic?      We do not believe it.

Would that he had also  inherited that \"strong and athletic\" frame which, according to his  aged preceptor, enabled Roswell M. Field to graduate at the age of  fifteen. It is not, however, for his learning and accomplishments of  mind and person that we are interested in Roswell Martin Field, but  for the strange incident in his life that uprooted him from the  congenial environments of New England and the career opening so  temptingly before him, to transplant him to Missouri, there to become  the father of a youth, who, by all laws of heredity and by the  peculiar tang of his genius, should have been born and nurtured amid  the stern scenes and fixed customs of Puritan New England. That story  must be told in another chapter.          CHAPTER II    HIS FATHER'S FIRST LOVE-AFFAIR      Many a time and oft in our walks and talks has Eugene Field told me the  story I am about to relate, but never with the particularity of detail  and the authority of absolute data with which I have \"comprehended it,\"  as he would say, in the following pages. It was his wish that it should  be told, and I follow his injunction the more readily, as in its  relation I am able to demonstrate how clearly the son inherited his  peculiar literary mode from the father.    It may be said further that, had the remarkable situation which grew  out of Roswell M. Field's first marriage occurred one hundred years  earlier, or had it occurred in our own day in a state like Kentucky, it  would have provoked a feud that could only have been settled by blood,  while it might readily have imbrued whole counties. Even in Vermont it  stirred up animosities which occupied the attention of the courts for  years, and which the lapse of nearly two generations has not wholly  eradicated from the memory of old inhabitants. In the opening remarks  of the opinion of the Supreme Court, in one of several cases growing  out of it, I find the following statement: \"It would be inexpedient to  recapitulate the testimony in a transaction which was calculated to  call up exasperated feelings, which has apparently taxed ingenuity and  genius to criminate and recriminate, where a deep sense of injury is  evidently felt and expressed by the parties to the controversy, and  where this state of feeling has extended, as it was to be expected, to  all the immediate friends of the parties, who from their situation were  necessarily compelled to become witnesses and to testify in the case.\"    In the relation of this story I shall substitute Christian names for  the surnames of the parties outside of the Field family, although all  have become public property and the principals are dead. The scene is  laid in the adjoining counties of Windham and Windsor in the Green  Mountain State, and this is how it happened:    There lived at Windsor, in the county of the same name, a widow named  Susanna, and she was well-to-do according to the modest standard of the  times. She was blest with a goodly family of sons and daughters, among  whom was Mary Almira, a maiden fair to look upon and impressionable  withal. Now it befell that Mary Almira, while still very young, was  sent to school at the Academy in Leicester, Mass., where she met, and,  in the language of the law, formed \"a natural and virtuous attachment\"  with a student named Jeremiah, sent thither by his guardian from  Oxbridge in the state last before mentioned. They met, vowed eternal  devotion and parted, as many school-children have done before and will  do again.    After her return to Windsor, Jeremiah seemingly faded from the thoughts  of Mary Almira, so that when she subsequently accompanied her mother on  a visit to Montreal, she felt free to experience \"a sincere and lively  affection\" for a Canadian youth named Elder. So lively was this  affection that when Jeremiah next saw Mary Almira it had completely  effaced him from her memory. Nothing daunted, however, being then of  the mature age of eighteen years and eight months, and two years Mary's  senior, he resumed the siege of her heart, and in short order their  engagement was duly \"promulgated and even notorious.\"    Before Mary succumbed to the second suit of Jeremiah, she waited for a  pledge of affection from young Mister Elder in the shape of an album in  which he was to have forwarded a communication, and it was \"in the  bitterness of her disappointment at not receiving a letter, message, or  remembrance from Mister Elder that she formed the engagement with  Jeremiah, in order that she might gratify her resentment by sending the  news of the same to Mister Elder.\" This she did with a peremptory  request for the return of her album without the leaves on which he had  written. What was her chagrin and unavailing remorse on receiving the  album to find that every leaf was cut out but one, a mute witness to  her \"infidelity to her early lover.\" Small wonder that \"her tenderness  revived,\" and \"she cursed the hour in which she had formed the  precipitate engagement with Jeremiah, and oftentimes she shed over that  album tears of heartfelt sorrow and regret.\" At least so we are told in  the pleadings, from which authentic source I draw my quotations.    Now Mary was nothing if not precipitate, for all this came to pass in  the spring or summer of 1831, when she was not quite sweet seventeen.  It also happened without the knowledge or concern of Roswell Martin  Field, who was a young and handsome bachelor of quick wit and engaging  manners, living at Fayetteville in the neighboring county, \"knowing  nothing at that time of the said Mary Almira, her lovers, suitors,  promises, engagements, intimacies, visits or movements whatsoever.\" He  was soon to know.    In the summer of 1832 it happened that Mary Almira was on a visit to  Mrs. Jonathan, her cousin german, the wife of Justice Jonathan of  Brattleboro, Vt. And now fate began to take a swift and inexplicable  interest in the affairs of Mary and Roswell. On August 30th, 1832, in  company with Mrs. Jonathan and Mrs. French (the Mary Field of the first  chapter of this book), Miss Mary Almira visited Fayetteville, and, we  are told, \"when the chaise containing the said ladies arrived Roswell  advanced to hand them out, and then for the first time saw and was  introduced to said Mary Almira, who received him with a nod and a broad  good-humored laugh.\" She remained over night, the guest of Mrs. French,  and Roswell saw her only for a few moments in his sister's  sitting-room. What occurred is naively told under oath in the following  extract from the pleadings:    \"Some conversation of a general nature passed between them, and as the  said Mary Almira was a young lady of very pleasing face and form and  agreeable manners, it is by no means improbable that he (Roswell)  manifested to said Mary Almira that in those matters he was not wholly  devoid of sensibility and discernment.\" The next morning Mary returned  to Brattleboro with Mrs. Jonathan, and Roswell \"did not then expect  ever to see her more.\"    But it was otherwise decreed, for after the lapse of eleven days  Justice Jonathan had professional business in Fayetteville, and, lo!  Mary Almira attended him. It was Tuesday, September 11th, when for a  second time she dawned on the discerning view of Roswell. For eight  days she lingered as a guest of Mrs. French, whose brother began to  show signs of awakening sensibility, although at this time informed of  the unbroken pact between Mary Almira and Jeremiah. How young love took  its natural course is told in the pleadings by Roswell with protests  \"against the manifest breach of delicacy and decorum of calling him  into this Honorable Court to render an account of his attentions to a  lady,\" and \"more especially when that lady is his lawful wedded wife.\"    When Mary had been in Fayetteville four days it happened that Justice  Jonathan was called to Westminster. When asked if she was inclined to  accompany him, Mary turned to Roswell and \"inquired with a smile if it  was not likely to rain?\" and Roswell confesses \"that he told her that  it would be very imprudent for her to set out.\"    [Illustration: ROSWELL MARTIN FIELD.  _Eugene Field's Father._]    Still protesting against the manifest indelicacy of the revelation,  Roswell has told for us the story of his first advances upon the  citadel of Mary's affections in words as cunningly chosen as were ever  the best passages in the writings of his son Eugene. It was on the  evening of September 13th that these advances first passed the outworks  of formal civility. \"When bidding the said Mary Almira good-night in  the sitting-room of Mrs. French, as he was about to retire into his  lodgings, Roswell plucked a leaf from the rosebush in the room, kissed  it, and presented it to her; on the next day when he saw the said Mary  Almira she took from her bosom a paper, unfolded it, and showed Roswell  a leaf (the same, he supposes, that was presented the evening before),  neatly stitched on the paper, and which she again carefully folded and  replaced in her bosom.\"    Another evening they played at chess, and with her permission Roswell  named the queen Miss Almira, and he bent all his energies to the  capture of that particular piece. He sacrificed every point of the game  to that object, and when it was triumphantly achieved, \"took note of  the pleasure and delight manifested by said Mary Almira at the ardor  with which he pursued his object and kissed his prize.\" On still  another occasion \"Jeremiah was introduced into the game as a black  bishop, but very soon was exchanged for a pawn.\"    On the day when Roswell advised Mary that it would be imprudent for her  to accompany Justice Jonathan to Westminster, she was \"graciously  pleased to make, with her own fair hand, a pocket pin-cushion of blue  silk and to put the same into Roswell's hands, at the same time"]]]
