Now the Grand Cophta laid both hands on the child's head and cried in a  loud voice, \"Open your eyes and look!\"    The child turned pale and shuddered as it fixed its gaze on the  decanter.    \"What do you see?\" asked the Grand Cophta, \"I want you to look into the  prison of General Beauharnais. What do you see?\"    \"I see a little room,\" said the child with vivacity. \"On a cot lies a  young man who sleeps; at his side stands another man, writing on a sheet  of paper that lies on a large book.\"    \"Can you read?\"    \"No, citizen. Now the man cuts off his hair, and folds it in the paper.\"    \"The one who sleeps?\"    \"No, the one who was just now writing. He is now writing something on  the back of the paper in which he wrapped the hair; now he opens a  little red pocket-book, and takes papers out of it; they are assignats,  he counts them and then puts them back in the pocket-book. Now he rises  and walks softly, softly.\"    \"What do you mean by softly? You have not heard the slightest noise as  yet, have you?\"    \"No, but he walks through the room on tiptoe.\"    \"What do you see now?\"    \"He now covers his face with his hands and seems to be weeping.\"    \"But what did he do with his pocket-book?\"    \"Ah, he has put the pocket book and the package with the hair in the  pocket of the coat that lies on the sleeping man's bed.\"    \"Of what color is this coat?\"    \"I cannot see, exactly; it is red or brown, lined with blue silk and  covered with shining buttons.\"    \"That will do,\" said the Grand Cophta; \"you can go to bed, child.\"    He stooped down over the child and breathed on her forehead. The little  girl seemed to awaken as from a trance, and hurried to her parents, who  led her from the hall.    \"General Beauharnais still lives!\" said the Grand Cophta, addressing  Josephine.    \"Yes, he still lives,\" cried she, sadly, \"but he is preparing for  death[1].\"    [Footnote 1: This scene is exactly as represented by the Marquise de  Crequi, who was present and relates it in her memoirs, vol. vi.,  p. 238.]    Josephine was right. A few days later Duchess d'Anville received a  package and a letter. It was sent to her by a prisoner in La Force,  named De Legrois. He had occupied the same cell with General Beauharnais  and had found the package and the letter, addressed to the duchess, in  his pocket on the morning of the execution of the general.    In this letter the general conjured Duchess D'Anville to deliver to  Josephine the package which contained his hair and his last adieus to  wife and children.    This was the only inheritance which General Beauharnais could bequeath  to his Josephine and her unhappy children!    Josephine was so agitated by the sight of her husband's hair and his  last fond words of adieu, that she fainted away, a stream of blood  gushing from her mouth.    Her companions in misfortune vied with each other in giving her the most  tender attention, and demanded of the jailer that a physician should  be called.    \"Why a physician!\" said the man, indifferently. \"Death is the best  physician. He called the general to-day; in a few days he will restore  to him his wife.\"    This prophecy was almost verified. Josephine, scarcely recovered from  her illness, received her citation from the Tribunal of Terror. This was  the herald of certain death, and she courageously prepared for the  grave, troubled only by thoughts of the children she must leave behind.    A fortunate and unforeseen occurrence saved her. The men of the  revolution had now attained the summit of their power, and, as there was  no standing still for them, they sank into the abyss which themselves  had digged.    The fall of Robespierre opened the prisons and set at liberty thousands  of the already condemned victims of the revolution.    Viscountess Josephine left her prison; she was restored to liberty, and  could now hasten to her children, but she came back to them as a poor  widow, for the seals of the \"one and indivisible republic\" were on hers  and her children's property as well as on that of all other aristocrats.        CHAPTER III.    CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVOLUTION.    France drew a breath of relief; the Reign of Terror was at an end, and a  milder and more moderate government wielded the sceptre over the poor  land that had so lately lain in the agonies of death. It was no longer a  capital offence to bear an aristocratic name, to be better dressed than  the _sans-culottes_, to wear no Jacobin-cap, and to be related to the  emigrants. The guillotine, which had ruled over Paris during two years  of blood and tears, now rested from its horrid work, and allowed the  Parisians to think of something else besides making their wills and  preparing for death.    Mindful of the uncertainty of the times, the people were disposed to  make the most of this release from the fear of immediate death, and to  enjoy themselves to the utmost while they could.    They had so long wept, that they eagerly desired to laugh once more; so  long lived in sorrow and fear, that they now ardently longed for  amusement and relaxation. The beautiful women of Paris, who had been  dethroned by the guillotine, and from whose hands the reins had been  torn, now found the courage to grasp these reins again, and reconquer  the position from which the storm-wind of the revolution had  hurled them.    Madame Tallien, the all-powerful wife of one of the five directors who  now swayed the destinies of France; Madame Recamier, the friend of all  the eminent and distinguished men of that period; and Madame de Stael,  the daughter of Necker, and the wife of the ambassador of Sweden, whose  government had recognized the republic--these three ladies gave to Paris  its drawing-rooms, its reunions, its _fetes_, its fashions, and its  luxury. All Paris had assumed a new form, and, although the Church had  not yet again obtained official recognition, the belief in a Supreme  Being was already re-established. Robespierre had already been bold  enough to cause the inscription, \"There is a Supreme Being,\" to be  placed over the altars of the churches that had been converted into  \"Temples of Reason.\" Yes, there is a Supreme Being; and Robespierre, who  had first acknowledged its existence, was soon to experience in himself  that such was the case. Betrayed by his own associates, and charged by  them with desiring to make himself dictator, and place himself at the  head of the new Roman-French Republic as a new Caesar, Robespierre fell  a prey to the Tribunal of Terror which he himself had called into  existence. While engaged in the Hotel de Ville in signing  death-sentences which were to furnish fresh victims to the guillotine,  he was arrested by the Jacobins and National Guards, who had stormed  the gates and penetrated into the building, and the attempt to blow out  his brains with his pistol miscarried. Bleeding, his jaw shattered by  the bullet, he was dragged before Fouquier-Tainville to receive his  sentence, and to be conducted thence to the scaffold. In order that the  proceeding should be attended with all formalities, he was, however,  first conducted to the Tuileries, where the Committee of Public Safety  was then sitting in the chamber of Queen Marie Antoinette. Into the  bedchamber of the queen whom Robespierre had brought to the scaffold,  the bleeding, half-lifeless dictator was now dragged. Like a bundle of  rags he was contemptuously thrown on the large table that stood in the  middle of the room. But yesterday Robespierre had been enthroned at this  table as almighty ruler over the lives and possessions of all Frenchmen;  but yesterday he had here issued his decrees and signed the  death-sentences, that lay on the table, unexecuted. These papers were  now the only salve the ghastly, groaning man could apply to the wound in  his face, from which blood poured in streams. The death-sentences signed  by himself now drank his own blood, and he had nothing but a rag of a  tricolor, thrown him by a compassionate _sans-culotte_, with which to  bind up the great, gaping wound on his head. As he sat there in the  midst of the blood-saturated papers, bleeding, groaning, and  complaining, an old National Guard, with outstretched arms, pointing to  this ghastly object, cried: \"Yes, Robespierre was right. There is a  Supreme Being!\"    This period of blood and terror was now over; Robespierre was dead;  Theroigne de Mericourt was no longer the Goddess of Reason, and  Mademoiselle Maillard no longer Goddess of Liberty and Virtue. Women had  given up representing divinities, and desired to be themselves again,  and to rebuild in the drawing-rooms of the capital, by means of their  intellect and grace, the throne which had gone down in the revolution.    Madame Tallien, Madame Recamier, and Madame de Stael, reorganized  society, and all were anxious to obtain admission to their parlors. To  be sure, these entertainments and reunions still wore a sufficiently  strange and fantastic appearance. Fashion, which had so long been  compelled to give way to the _carmagnole_ and red cap, endeavored to  avenge its long banishment by all manner of caprices and humors, and in  doing so assumed a political, reactionary aspect. _Coiffures a la  Jacobine_ were now supplanted by _coiffures a la victime_ and _au  repentir_. In order to exhibit one's taste for the fine arts, the  draperies of the statues of Greece and ancient Rome were now worn.  Grecian _fetes_ were given, at which the black soup of Lycurgus was duly  honored, and Roman feasts which, in splendor and extravagance, rivalled  those of Lucullus. These Roman feasts were particularly in vogue at the  palace of Luxembourg, where the directors of the republic had now taken  up their residence, and where Madame Tallien exhibited to the new French  society the new wonders of luxury and fashion.

You have offended Him infinitely more      than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince: and yet it is nothing but      His hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment; it      is ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last      night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you      closed your eyes to sleep; and there is no other reason to be given,      why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning,      but that God's hand has held you up; there is no other reason to be      given why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the      house of God provoking His pure eyes by your sinful, wicked manner      of attending His solemn worship; yea, there is nothing else that is      to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment drop down      into hell.        O sinner! consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great      furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of      wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God whose wrath is      provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the      damned in hell: you hang by a slender thread, with the flames of      divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it      and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and      nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the      flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have      done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one      moment.        Consider this, you that are here present, that yet remain in an      unregenerate state. That God will execute the fierceness of His      anger, implies that He will inflict wrath without any pity.    Even though increasing knowledge may have somewhat softened the language  of vengeance, still both religion and the law have found their chief  justification for punishment in the doctrine of revenge.    The church has constantly taught from the first that God would punish  the sinner with everlasting torment. It has taught that all are bad from  birth and can be saved only by grace. The punishment to be suffered was  as terrible as man's mind could conceive. It would continue infinitely  beyond the time when it might be needed for correction or example. In  spite of a few humane or over-sensitive ministers, the doctrine persists  and is carefully preserved by the church. That the State likewise holds  fast to the idea of vengeance, punishment for the sake of suffering, is  just as evident. One needs only to note the force and degree of hatred  of the good to the one accused of crime, and the zeal that is shown for  a man hunt, to realize how deeply the feeling of vengeance is planted in  the structure of man. The truth is that it was a part of life before  religion and political institutions were evolved.    Still, most people are now ashamed to admit that punishment is based on  vengeance and, for that reason, various excuses and apologies have been  offered for the cruelty that goes with it. Some of the more humane, or  \"squeamish,\" who still believe in punishment, contend that the object of  this infliction is the reformation of the victim. This, of course,  cannot be urged of the death penalty or even punishment for life, or for  very long-term sentences. In these cases there is neither inducement to  reform nor any object in the reformation. No matter how thorough the  reform, the prisoner never goes back to society, or he returns after  there is no longer a chance for him to be of use to the world or to  enjoy life.    Those who say that punishment is for the purpose of reforming the  prisoner are not familiar with human psychology. The prison almost  invariably tends to brutalize men and breeds bitterness and blank  despair. The life of the ordinary prisoner is given over to criticism  and resentment against existing things, especially to settled hatred of  those who are responsible for his punishment. Only a few, and these are  the weakest, ever blame themselves for their situation. Every man of  intelligence can trace the various steps that led him to the prison  door, and he can feel, if he does not understand, how inevitable each  step was. The number of \"repeaters\" in prison shows the effect of this  kind of a living death upon the inmates. To be branded as a criminal and  turned out in the world again leaves one weakened in the struggle of  life and handicapped in a race that is hard enough for most men at the  best. In prison and after leaving prison, the man lives in a world of  his own; a world where all moral values are different from those  professed by the jailer and society in general. The great influence that  helps to keep many men from committing crime--the judgment of his  fellows--no longer deters him in his conduct. In fact, every person who  understands penal institutions--no matter how well such places are  managed--knows that a thousand are injured or utterly destroyed by  service in prison, where one is helped.    Very few persons seriously believe that offenders are sent to prison out  of kindness to the men. If there were any foundation for this idea, each  prisoner would be carefully observed, and when he was fit would be  returned to the world. Not even the parole laws, which provide various  reasons and ways for shortening sentences, ever lay down the rule that  one may be released when he has reformed.    A much larger class of people offers the excuse that punishment deters  from crime. In fact, this idea is so well rooted that few think of  questioning it. The idea that punishment deters from crime does not mean  that the individual prisoner is prevented from another criminal act. A  convicted man is kept in jail for as long a time as in the judgment of  the jury, the court, or the parole board, will make him atone, or at  least suffer sufficiently for the offence. If the terms are not long  enough, they can be made longer. The idea that punishment deters, means  that unless A shall be punished for murder, then B will kill; therefore  A must be punished, not for his own sake, but to keep B from crime. This  is vicarious punishment which can hardly appeal to one who is either  just or humane. But does punishing A keep B from the commission of  crime? It certainly does not make a more social man of B. If it operates  on him in any way it is to make him afraid to commit crime; but the  direct result of scaring B is not to keep him from the commission of  crime, but to make him use precautions that will keep him safe from  discovery. How far the fear of detection and punishment prevents crime  is, of course, purely theoretical and cannot be settled either by  statistics or logic. One thing is sure, that if B is kept from crime, it  is through fear, and of all the enemies of man, fear is the one which  causes most misery and pain.    There are many facts that show that the punishment of one does not deter  others. Over and over again crimes are committed, by the young  especially, that resemble in every detail a previous crime which has  received large publicity through the newspapers, often through the  hanging of some culprit. Even the unthinking public, always clamoring  for severe penalties, does not believe that the example of punishment  deters. The public forbids the exhibition of pictures of hangings and of  crimes. Somehow, vaguely and dimly as most men see everything, the  public realizes that instead of punishments preventing crime,  punishments suggest crime. In the olden days when men admitted that  vengeance and punishment went together, they were at least more logical,  for executions were in the open light of day so all might see and be  deterred.    But this sort of punishment was abolished long ago. Now executions are  behind tightly-closed doors, often before day-break, with no one present  but a doctor to pronounce the victim dead, a preacher to try to save his  soul, and a few favored guests. The most humane individuals advocate  suppressing the stories in the newspapers, beyond an obituary notice for  the deceased, and forbidding the publication of the details of the crime  and its penalty. So far as this succeeds, it is a confession that  punishment does not deter, but instead suggests and encourages crime.  The idea that crime is prevented by punishment, if believed, would be  followed by requirements that the young should visit prisons that they  might realize the consequences of crime, and that all executions should  be public and should be performed on the highest hill.    So much has been written about the decrease of crime that follows the  reduction of penalties, and likewise about the numerous crimes of  violence which generally follow public hangings, that it is hardly  necessary to recall it to the reader. The fact is, those who say that  punishment deters have no confidence in their own statement.    The operations of the human mind have always been clouded in mystery and  obscurity. The effect of what is seen and heard and felt has never been  certain. The great power of suggestion, especially with the young, is  only now beginning to be understood. Many things can be done by  suggestion. The immature brain records everything that the senses carry  to it through the nerves; these records, through lively imagination, are  constantly suggesting and urging to action. All good teachers and  observing parents know its power and, so far as such matters can be  proved, it seems clear that the details of crime and punishment  reproduce themselves over and over again by the suggestion carried to  the mind, especially with the young. There is every reason to think that  suggestions of crime will affect the mind as much as suggestions of  adventure, love or war.    Does it then follow that no one shall be restrained from freedom on  account of either his actions"]]]
