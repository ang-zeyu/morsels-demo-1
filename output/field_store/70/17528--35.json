Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;  What reason that another's violence  Should stint the measure of my fair desert?    \"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,  That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,  Return.  These are the questions which thy will  Urge equally; and therefore I the first  Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.  Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd,  Moses and Samuel, and either John,  Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,  Have not in any other heav'n their seats,  Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;  Nor more or fewer years exist; but all  Make the first circle beauteous, diversely  Partaking of sweet life, as more or less  Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.  Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns  This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee  Of that celestial furthest from the height.  Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:  Since from things sensible alone ye learn  That, which digested rightly after turns  To intellectual.  For no other cause  The scripture, condescending graciously  To your perception, hands and feet to God  Attributes, nor so means: and holy church  Doth represent with human countenance  Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made  Tobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,  The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms  Each soul restor'd to its particular star,  Believing it to have been taken thence,  When nature gave it to inform her mold:  Since to appearance his intention is  E'en what his words declare: or else to shun  Derision, haply thus he hath disguis'd  His true opinion.  If his meaning be,  That to the influencing of these orbs revert  The honour and the blame in human acts,  Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.  This principle, not understood aright,  Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;  So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,  And Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,  Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings  No peril of removing thee from me.    \"That, to the eye of man, our justice seems  Unjust, is argument for faith, and not  For heretic declension.  To the end  This truth may stand more clearly in your view,  I will content thee even to thy wish    \"If violence be, when that which suffers, nought  Consents to that which forceth, not for this  These spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,  That will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth  As nature doth in fire, tho' violence  Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield  Or more or less, so far it follows force.  And thus did these, whom they had power to seek  The hallow'd place again.  In them, had will  Been perfect, such as once upon the bars  Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola  To his own hand remorseless, to the path,  Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,  When liberty return'd: but in too few  Resolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these words  If duly weigh'd, that argument is void,  Which oft might have perplex'd thee still.  But now  Another question thwarts thee, which to solve  Might try thy patience without better aid.  I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,  That blessed spirit may not lie; since near  The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:  And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn  That Constance held affection to the veil;  So that she seems to contradict me here.  Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men  To do what they had gladly left undone,  Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:  E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit  Slew his own mother, so made pitiless  Not to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,  That force and will are blended in such wise  As not to make the' offence excusable.  Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,  That inasmuch as there is fear of woe  From non-compliance, it agrees.  Of will  Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I  Of th' other; so that both have truly said.\"    Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd  From forth the fountain of all truth; and such  The rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found.    \"O thou of primal love the prime delight!  Goddess!\"  I straight reply'd, \"whose lively words  Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!  Affection fails me to requite thy grace  With equal sum of gratitude: be his  To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.  Well I discern, that by that truth alone  Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,  Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:  Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lair  The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,  And she hath power to reach it; else desire  Were given to no end.  And thence doth doubt  Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;  And it is nature which from height to height  On to the summit prompts us.  This invites,  This doth assure me, lady, rev'rently  To ask thee of other truth, that yet  Is dark to me.  I fain would know, if man  By other works well done may so supply  The failure of his vows, that in your scale  They lack not weight.\"  I spake; and on me straight  Beatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks  Of love celestial in such copious stream,  That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,  I turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight.          CANTO V    \"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love  Illume me, so that I o'ercome thy power  Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause  In that perfection of the sight, which soon  As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach  The good it apprehends.  I well discern,  How in thine intellect already shines  The light eternal, which to view alone  Ne'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else  Your love seduces, 't is but that it shows  Some ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.    \"This would'st thou know, if failure of the vow  By other service may be so supplied,  As from self-question to assure the soul.\"    Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,  Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off  Discourse, continued in her saintly strain.  \"Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave  Of his free bounty, sign most evident  Of goodness, and in his account most priz'd,  Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith  All intellectual creatures, and them sole  He hath endow'd.  Hence now thou mayst infer  Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd  That when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;  For in the compact between God and him,  This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,  He makes the victim, and of his own act.  What compensation therefore may he find?  If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,  By using well thou think'st to consecrate,  Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.  Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.    \"But forasmuch as holy church, herein  Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth  I have discover'd to thee, yet behooves  Thou rest a little longer at the board,  Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,  Digested fitly to nutrition turn.  Open thy mind to what I now unfold,  And give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comes  Of learning well retain'd, unfruitful else.    \"This sacrifice in essence of two things  Consisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,  The covenant the other.  For the last,  It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence  I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.  For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,  Though leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change  The offering, still to offer.  Th' other part,  The matter and the substance of the vow,  May well be such, to that without offence  It may for other substance be exchang'd.  But at his own discretion none may shift  The burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd  By either key, the yellow and the white.  Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,  If the last bond be not within the new  Included, as the quatre in the six.  No satisfaction therefore can be paid  For what so precious in the balance weighs,  That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.  Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith  Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,  Blindly to execute a rash resolve,  Whom better it had suited to exclaim,  'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledge  By doing worse or, not unlike to him  In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:  Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd  Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn  Both wise and simple, even all, who hear  Of so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,  O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind  Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves  In every water.  Either testament,  The old and new, is yours: and for your guide  The shepherd of the church let this suffice  To save you.  When by evil lust entic'd,  Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;  Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,  Hold you in mock'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,  That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,  To dally with itself in idle play.\"    Such were the words that Beatrice spake:  These ended, to that region, where the world  Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.    Though mainly prompt new question to propose,  Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.  And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,  Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped  Into the second realm.  There I beheld  The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb  Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star  Were mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,  Whom nature hath made apt for every change!    As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,  If aught approach them from without, do draw  Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew  Full more than thousand splendours towards us,  And in each one was heard: \"Lo! one arriv'd  To multiply our loves!\" and as each came  The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,  Witness'd augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,  If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,  To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;  And thou shalt see what vehement desire  Possess'd me, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],[0,"Drum-Taps (#3)"],[1,"zed. And in yet another memory of  this great American Whitman attains to his best and highest, \"When Lilacs  Last in the Doorway Bloom'd.\" It is one of the most beautiful of poems,  of the purest intuition, of a consummate, if unconscious, artistry. Whose  voice is it that rings and echoes, now low and tender, now solemn and  desolate, now clear, full, victorious, out of its cloistral  solitude--that of the mourner himself, of all-heedfull, heedless Nature,  of the immortal soul of man, or just a bird, the shy and hidden, sweet,  small hermit thrush? The last division of his life's work--his fond Epic,  his cosmic \"inventory\"--as Whitman planned it, was to be devoted to the  chaunting of songs of death and immortality. The soldier to whom he read  of Christ's Resurrection talked of death to him, and said he did not fear  it. He talked to a man who did not enjoy religion in the way a Christian  means, to whom the mystery of Easter is an all-sufficing \"reliance.\" But  Whitman not only did not fear death. The thought of it was to him the  strangest of raptures, the reverie of a child dreaming of a distant  mother, soon to come again. Death and immortality were but two aspects of  the same blessed hope to this man, who poured out his life in a turgid  fount of ecstatic joy in living:      ... And I saw askant the armies,    I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,    Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I              saw them,    And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,    And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),    And the staffs all splintered and broken.      I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,    And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,    I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,    But I saw they were not as was thought,    They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,    The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,    And the wives and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,    And the armies that remain'd suffer'd....      _Come lovely and soothing death,    Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,    In the night, in the day, to all, to each,    Sooner or later delicate death._      _Prais'd be the fathomless universe,    For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,    And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!    For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death._      _Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet    Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?    Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,    I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come              unfalteringly._            DRUM-TAPS          FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE.        First O songs for a prelude,    Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,    How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,    How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,    (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!    O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than              steel!)    How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with              indifferent hand,    How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard              in their stead,    How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of              soldiers,)    How Manhattan drum-taps led.      Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,    Forty years as a pageant, still unawares the lady of this teeming and              turbulent city,    Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,    With her million children around her, suddenly,    At dead of night, at news from the south,    Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.      A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,    Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.    From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,    Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.      To the drum-taps prompt,    The young men falling in and arming,    The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's              hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)    The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the              court,    The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing              the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,    The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all              leaving;    Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,    The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their              accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,    Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musketbarrels,    The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the              sunrise cannon and again at sunset,    Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark              from the wharves,    (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with              their guns on their shoulders!    How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and              their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)    The blood of the city up--arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,    The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the              public buildings and stores,    The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his              mother,    (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain              him,)    The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the              way,    The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their              favorites,    The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble              lightly over the stones,    (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,    Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)    All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,    The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,    The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no              mere parade now;    War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning              away;    War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to              welcome it.      Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!    It's O for a manly life in the camp.      And the sturdy artillery,    The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,    Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for              courtesies merely,    Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)      And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,    Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,    Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid              all your children,    But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.          EIGHTEEN SIXTY-ONE.        Arm'd year--year of the struggle,    No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,    Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas              piano,    But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,              carrying a rifle on your shoulder,    With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in              the belt at your side,    As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the              continent,    Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,    Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the              dwellers in Manhattan,    Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and              Indiana,    Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the              Alleghanies,    Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the              Ohio river,    Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at              Chattanooga on the mountain top,    Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing              weapons, robust year,    Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,    Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd cannon,    I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.          BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!        Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Through the windows-through doors-burst like a ruthless force,    Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,    Into the school where the scholar is studying;    Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with              his bride,    Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering              his grain,    So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.      Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;    Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers              must sleep in those beds,    No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would they              continue?    Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?    Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the              judge?    Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.      Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,    Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,    Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,    Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,    Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the              hearses,    So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.
