The tension  portion of the fracture is nearly the same as though the piece  were pulled in two lengthwise. The fibre walls are torn across  obliquely and usually in a spiral direction. There is  practically no pulling apart of the fibres, that is, no  separation of the fibres along their walls, regardless of their  thickness. The nature of tension failure is apparently not  affected by the moisture condition of the specimen, at least not  so much so as the other strength values.[3]    [Footnote 3: See Brush, Warren D.: A microscopic study of the  mechanical failure of wood. Vol. II, Rev. F.S. Investigations,  Washington, D.C., 1912, p. 35.]    Tension at right angles to the grain is closely related to  cleavability. When wood fails in this manner the thin fibre  walls are torn in two lengthwise while the thick-walled fibres  are usually pulled apart along the primary wall.    |--------------------------------------------|  |                 TABLE III                  |  |--------------------------------------------|  |  TENSILE STRENGTH AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE   |  | GRAIN OF SMALL CLEAR PIECES OF 25 WOODS IN |  |              GREEN CONDITION               |  |         (Forest Service Cir. 213)          |  |--------------------------------------------|  |                  |    When    |    When    |  |   COMMON NAME    | surface of | surface of |  |   OF SPECIES     | failure is | failure is |  |                  |   radial   | tangential |  |------------------+------------+------------|  |                  |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  |  |                  |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  |  |                  |            |            |  |    Hardwoods     |            |            |  |                  |            |            |  | Ash, white       |      645   |      671   |  | Basswood         |      226   |      303   |  | Beech            |      633   |      969   |  | Birch, yellow    |      446   |      526   |  | Elm, slippery    |      765   |      832   |  | Hackberry        |      661   |      786   |  | Locust, honey    |    1,133   |    1,445   |  | Maple, sugar     |      610   |      864   |  | Oak, post        |      714   |      924   |  |   red            |      639   |      874   |  |   swamp white    |      757   |      909   |  |   white          |      622   |      749   |  |   yellow         |      728   |      929   |  | Sycamore         |      540   |      781   |  | Tupelo           |      472   |      796   |  |                  |            |            |  |    Conifers      |            |            |  |                  |            |            |  | Arborvitae        |      241   |      235   |  | Cypress, bald    |      242   |      251   |  | Fir, white       |      213   |      304   |  | Hemlock          |      271   |      323   |  | Pine, longleaf   |      240   |      298   |  |   red            |      179   |      205   |  |   sugar          |      239   |      304   |  |   western yellow |      230   |      252   |  |   white          |      225   |      285   |  | Tamarack         |      236   |      274   |  |--------------------------------------------|        COMPRESSIVE OR CRUSHING STRENGTH      ~Compression across the grain~ is very closely related to  hardness and transverse shear. There are two ways in which wood  is subjected to stress of this kind, namely, (1) with the load  acting over the entire area of the specimen, and (2) with a load  concentrated over a portion of the area. (See Fig. 2.) The  latter is the condition more commonly met with in practice, as,  for example, where a post rests on a horizontal sill, or a rail  rests on a cross-tie. The former condition, however, gives the  true resistance of the grain to simple crushing.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Compression across the grain.]    The first effect of compression across the grain is to compact  the fibres, the load gradually but irregularly increasing as the  density of the material is increased. If the specimen lies on a  flat surface and the load is applied to only a portion of the  upper area, the bearing plate indents the wood, crushing the  upper fibres without affecting the lower part. (See Fig. 3.) As  the load increases the projecting ends sometimes split  horizontally. (See Fig. 4.) The irregularities in the load are  due to the fact that the fibres collapse a few at a time,  beginning with those with the thinnest walls. The projection of  the ends increases the strength of the material directly beneath  the compressing weight by introducing a beam action which helps  support the load. This influence is exerted for a short distance  only.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Side view of failures in compression  across the grain, showing crushing of blocks under bearing  plate. Specimen at right shows splitting at ends.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--End view of failures in compression  across the grain, showing splitting of the ends of the test  specimens.]    When wood is used for columns, props, posts, and spokes, the  weight of the load tends to shorten the material endwise. This  is ~endwise compression~, or compression parallel to the grain.  In the case of long columns, that is, pieces in which the length  is very great compared with their diameter, the failure is by  sidewise bending or flexure, instead of by crushing or  splitting. (See Fig. 5.) A familiar instance of this action is  afforded by a flexible walking-stick. If downward pressure is  exerted with the hand on the upper end of the stick placed  vertically on the floor, it will be noted that a definite amount  of force must be applied in each instance before decided flexure  takes place. After this point is reached a very slight increase  of pressure very largely increases the deflection, thus  obtaining so great a leverage about the middle section as to  cause rupture.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Testing a buggy spoke in endwise  compression, illustrating the failure by sidewise bending of a  long column fixed only at the lower end. _Photo by U. S. Forest  Service_]    The lateral bending of a column produces a combination of  bending with compressive stress over the section, the  compressive stress being maximum at the section of greatest  deflection on the concave side. The convex surface is under  tension, as in an ordinary beam test. (See Fig. 6.) If the same  stick is braced in such a way that flexure is prevented, its  supporting strength is increased enormously, since the  compressive stress acts uniformly over the section, and failure  is by crushing or splitting, as in small blocks. In all columns  free to bend in any direction the deflection will be seen in the  direction in which the column is least stiff. This sidewise  bending can be overcome by making pillars and columns thicker in  the middle than at the ends, and by bracing studding, props, and  compression members of trusses. The strength of a column also  depends to a considerable extent upon whether the ends are free  to turn or are fixed.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Unequal distribution of stress in a long  column due to lateral bending.]    |-------------------------------------------------------|  |                       TABLE IV                        |  |-------------------------------------------------------|  |   RESULTS OF COMPRESSION TESTS ACROSS THE GRAIN ON    |  |   51 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION, AND COMPARISON WITH    |  |                       WHITE OAK                       |  |                 (U.

CHAPTER II.      Sauces.    A RICH BROWN GRAVY.    Take a little good beef consomme, or stock, a small piece of smoked  beef, or _chorissa_, a lemon sliced, some chopped shalots, a couple  of onions shred, a bay leaf, two or three cloves, and a little oil;  simmer gently, and add a little minced parsley, and a few chopped  mushrooms: skim and strain.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE PIQUANTE.    The above may be rendered a Sauce Piquante by substituting a little  vinegar, whole capers, allspice, and thyme, instead of the smoked  beef and lemon; a few onions and piccalilli chopped finely, is a great  addition when required to be very piquante.    A sauce like the above is very good to serve with beef that has been  boiled for broth.           *       *       *       *       *    A GOOD GRAVY FOR ROAST FOWLS.    Take a little stock, squeeze in the juice of a lemon, add a little  mushroom powder, cayenne pepper and salt; thicken with flour.           *       *       *       *       *    ANOTHER EXCELLENT RECEIPT.    Chop some mushrooms, young and fresh, salt them, and put them into a  saucepan with a little gravy, made of the trimmings of the fowl, or  of veal, a blade of mace, a little grated lemon peel, the juice of  one lemon; thicken with flour, and when ready to serve, stir in a  table-spoonful of white wine.           *       *       *       *       *    EGG SAUCE: A FINE WHITE SAUCE FOR BOILED CHICKENS, TURKEYS, OR WHITE  FRICASSEES.    Beat up the yolks of four eggs with the juice of a fine lemon, a  tea-spoonful of flour, and a little cold water, mix well together, and  set it on the fire to thicken, stirring it to prevent curdling. This  sauce will be found excellent, if not superior, in many cases where  English cooks use melted butter. If capers are substituted for the  lemon juice, this sauce will be found excellent for boiled lamb or  mutton.           *       *       *       *       *    CELERY SAUCE.    Cut in small pieces from about four to five heads of celery, which if  not very young must be peeled, simmer it till tender in half a pint of  veal gravy, if intended for white sauce, then add a spoonful of flour,  the yolks of three eggs, white pepper, salt, and the juice of one  lemon, these should be previously mixed together with a little water  till perfectly smooth and thin, and be stirred in with the sauce;  cream, instead of eggs, is used in English kitchens.           *       *       *       *       *    TOMATO SAUCE.    Skin a dozen fine tomatos, set them on the fire in a little water  or gravy, beat them up with a little vinegar, lemon juice, cayenne  pepper, and salt; some persons like the yolk of an egg, well beaten  added. Strain or not, as may be preferred.           *       *       *       *       *    GRAVY FOR A FOWL, WHEN THERE IS NO STOCK TO MAKE IT WITH.    Take the feet, wash them, cut them small, also the neck and gizzard;  season them with pepper and salt, onion, and parsley, let them simmer  gently for some time, in about a breakfast-cup of water, then strain,  thicken with flour, and add a little browning, and if liked, a small  quantity of any store sauce at hand, and it will prove an excellent  sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    SAVOURY JELLY, FOR COLD PIES, OR TO GARNISH COLD POULTRY.    Have a bare knuckle of veal, and a calf's foot or cow heel; put it  into a stew-pan with a thick slice of smoked beef, a few herbs, a  blade of mace, two or three onions, a little lemon peel, pepper  and salt, and three or four pints of water (the French add a little  tarragon vinegar). When it boils skim it, and when cold, if not clear,  boil it a few minutes with the white and shell of an egg, and pass it  through a jelly bag, this jelly with the juice of two or three lemons,  and poured into a mould, in which are put the yolks of eggs boiled  hard, forms a pretty supper dish.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE SAUCE FOR STEAKS.    Throw into a saucepan a piece of fat the size of an egg, with two  or three onions sliced, let them brown; add a little gravy, flour, a  little vinegar, a spoonful of mustard, and a little cayenne pepper,  boil it and serve with the steaks.           *       *       *       *       *    A FISH SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER.    Put on, in a small saucepan, a cup of water, well flavored with  vinegar, an onion chopped fine, a little rasped horse-radish, pepper,  and two or three cloves, and a couple of anchovies cut small, when it  has boiled, stir carefully in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and let it  thicken, until of the consistency of melted butter.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE FISH SAUCE.    One teacup full of walnut pickle, the same of mushroom ditto, three  anchovies pounded, one clove of garlic pounded, half a tea-spoonful of  cayenne pepper, all mixed well together, and bottled for use.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE SAUCE TO THROW OVER BROILED MEATS.    Beat up a little salad-oil with a table-spoonful of vinegar, mustard,  pepper and salt, and then stir in the yolk of an egg; this sauce  should be highly seasoned. A sauce of this description is sometimes  used to baste mutton while roasting, the meat should be scored in  different places to allow the sauce to penetrate.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE FOR DUCKS.    A little good gravy, with a glass of port wine, the juice of a lemon,  highly seasoned with cayenne pepper.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAD SAUCE.    Take a large onion and boil it, with a little pepper till quite soft,  in milk, then take it out, and pour the milk over grated stale bread,  then boil it up with a piece of butter, and dredge it with flour; it  should be well beaten up with a silver fork.    The above can be made without butter or milk: take a large onion,  slice it thin, put it into a little veal gravy, add grated bread,  pepper, &c., and the yolk and white of an egg well beaten.           *       *       *       *       *    APPLE SAUCE FOR GOOSE.    Slice some apples, put them in a little water to simmer till soft,  beat them to a pulp; some consider a little powdered sugar an  improvement, but as the acid of the apples is reckoned a corrective to  the richness of the goose, it is usually preferred without.           *       *       *       *       *    MINT SAUCE.    Mix vinegar with brown sugar, let it stand about an hour, then add  chopped mint, and stir together.           *       *       *       *       *    ONION SAUCE.    Slice finely, and brown in a little oil, two or three onions; put them  in a little beef gravy, and add cayenne pepper, salt, and the juice of  a lemon. This is a nice sauce for steaks.           *       *       *       *       *    OILED BUTTER.    Put some good butter into a cup or jar, and place it before the fire  till it becomes an oil, then pour it off, so that all sediment may be  avoided.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRAW GOOD GRAVY.           *       *       *       *       *    Cut some gravy beef into small pieces, put them in a jar, and set it  in a saucepan of cold water to boil gently for seven or eight hours,  adding, from time to time, more water as the original quantity boils  away. The gravy thus made will be the essence of the meat, and in  cases where nutriment is required in the smallest compass, will be  of great service. Soups are stronger when the meat is cut, and gravy  drawn before water is added.           *       *       *       *       *    TRUFFLE SAUCE.    Peel and slice as many truffles as required, simmer them gently with  a little butter, when they are tender, add to them good white or brown  consomme, lemon juice, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a very little white  wine.           *       *       *       *       *    MUSHROOM SAUCE.    Take about a pint of fine young button mushrooms, let them stew gently  in a white veal gravy seasoned with salt, pepper, a blade of mace, and  if approved, the grated peel of half a lemon, it should be thickened  with flour and the yolk of an egg stirred in it, just before serving;  English cooks add cream to this sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEET SAUCE.    The usual way of making sauces for puddings, is by adding sugar  to melted butter, or thin egg sauce, flavoring it with white wine,  brandy, lemon peel, or any other flavor approved of.           *       *       *       *       *    MELTED BUTTER.    Although this sauce is one of the most simple, it is very rarely that  it is well made. Mix with four ounces of butter, a desert spoonful  of flour, when well mixed, add three table spoonsful of water, put it  into a clean saucepan kept for the purpose, and stir it carefully  one way till it boils; white sauce to throw over vegetables served on  toast, is made in the same way, only putting milk and water, instead  of water only.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER FOR BOILED PUDDINGS.    Mix a table-spoonful of flour, with two of water, add a little wine,  lemon peel grated, a small bit of clarified suet, of the size of a  walnut, grated nutmeg, and sugar, put on in a saucepan, stirring one  way, and adding water if too thick, lemon juice, or essence of noyeau,  or almonds may be substituted to vary the flavour.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE ROBERT FOR STEAKS.    Chop up some onions, throw them into a saucepan with a bit of  clarified fat, let them fry till brown, then add pepper, salt, a  little gravy, mustard, lemon juice, and vinegar; boil it all, and pour  over the steaks.           *       *       *       *       *    CAPER SAUCE.    This is merely melted butter with a few pickled capers simmered in it,  or they may be put into a sauce made of broth thickened with egg, and  a little flour.           *       *       *       *       "]]]
