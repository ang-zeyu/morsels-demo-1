From this foramen runs the  _Plantar Groove_, a channel, bounded above by the superior edge, and below  by the semilunar crest of the bone, which conducts the plantar arteries  into the _Semilunar Sinus_, a well-marked cavity in the interior of the  bone.    _The Superior or Articular Surface_ consists of two shallow depressions,  divided by a slight median ridge. Its posterior part shows a transversely  elongated facet for articulation with the navicular bone.    _The Superior Edge_, outlining the superior margin of the laminal surface,  describes a curve, with the convexity of the curve forward. In the centre  of the curve is a triangular process, the _Pyramidal Process_, which serves  as the point of attachment of the extensor pedis.    _The Inferior Edge_, the most extensive of the three, separates the laminal  from the solar surface. It is semicircular in shape, sharp, and finely  dentated, and is perforated by eight to ten large foraminae.    _The Posterior Edge_, very slightly concave, divides the small,  transversely elongated facet of the superior surface from the posterior  region of the inferior surface.    _The Lateral Angles_ of the bone, also termed the _Wings_, are two  projections directed backwards. Each is divided by a cleft into an upper,  the _Basilar Process_, and a lower, the _Retrossal Process_. In old animals  the posterior portion of the cleft separating the two processes gradually  becomes filled in with bony deposit, thus transforming the cleft into a  foramen, which gives passage to the preplantar artery. We may mention  in passing that the lateral angles give attachment to the lateral  fibro-cartilages, and that the lateral angles themselves in old horses  become increased in size owing to ossification of portions of the adjacent  lateral cartilages.    _Development_.--The os pedis ossifies from two centres, one of which is for  the articular surface; but this epiphysis fuses with the rest of the bone  before birth.

It  is elongated transversely, flattened from above to below, and narrow at its  extremities. In it we see two surfaces, and two borders.    _The Superior or Articular Surface_ of the bone, which may easily be  recognised by its smoothness, is moulded upon the lower articular surface  of the second phalanx, being convex in its middle, and concave on either  side.    _The Inferior or Tendinous Surface_ resembles the preceding in form, but  is broader and less smooth. In the recent state it is covered with  fibro-cartilage for the passage of the flexor perforans.    _The Anterior Border_ possesses above a small transversely elongated facet  for articulation with the os pedis, and below a more extensive grooved  portion, perforated by numerous foraminae, affording attachment to the  interosseous ligaments of the articulation.    _The Posterior Border_, thick in the middle, but thinner towards the  extremities, is roughened for ligamentous attachment.    _Development_.--The bone ossifies from a single centre.      B. THE LIGAMENTS.    THE ARTICULATION OF THE FIRST WITH THE SECOND PHALANX, OR THE PASTERN  JOINT.--Adhering to the limit we have set, this articulation should not  receive our attention. As, however, we shall in a later page be concerned  with fractures of the os coronae, which fractures may affect the  articulation above mentioned, a brief note of its formation will not be out  of place.    It is an imperfect hinge-joint, permitting of extension and flexion,  allowing the first phalanx to pivot on the second, and admitting of the  performance of slight lateral movements. It is formed by the opposing of  the inferior surface of the os suffraginis with the superior surface of the  os coronae. The articulating surface of the os coronae is supplemented by  the addition behind of a thick piece of _fibro-cartilage (the glenoid_)  attached inferiorly to the posterior edge of the upper articulatory surface  of the os coronae, and superiorly by means of three fibrous slips on each  side to the os suffraginis. The innermost of these three slips becomes  attached to about the middle of the lateral edge of the suffraginis, and  the remaining two, beneath the first, attach themselves to nearer the lower  end of that bone. The posterior surface of the complementary cartilage  forms a gliding surface for the passage of the perforans.

Each is inserted  superiorly into the lateral tubercle of the lower end of the first phalanx,  and inferiorly to the side of the second phalanx, their most inferior  fibres becoming finally fixed to the extremities of the navicular bone,  where they form the postero-lateral ligaments of the pedal articulation.  In front of the joint the extensor pedis plays the part of an additional  ligament.    _The Synovial Membrane_.--This is limited in front by the tendon of the  extensor pedis, on each side by the lateral ligaments of the joint, and  behind by the glenoid fibro-cartilage. At this point it is prolonged  upwards as a pouch behind the lower extremity of the first phalanx.    THE ARTICULATION OF THE SECOND PHALANX WITH THE THIRD, THE PEDAL, OR THE  COFFIN JOINT.--This also is an imperfect hinge-joint, permitting only of  flexion and extension, which movements are more restricted than in the  previous articulation. Three bones enter into its formation: the second  phalanx, the third phalanx, and the navicular bone. The lower articulatory  surface is formed by the third phalanx and the navicular bone combined.  To effect this the navicular is closely and firmly attached to the third  phalanx by an interosseous ligament. The two bones, as one, are then  connected to the second phalanx by four lateral ligaments, an anterior and  a posterior on each side.    _The Interosseous Ligament_ consists of extremely short fibres running from  the extensively grooved portion of the anterior surface of the navicular  bone to become attached to the os pedis immediately behind its articular  surface.    _The Antero-lateral Ligaments_ are attached by their superior extremities  to the lateral surfaces of the second phalanx, and by their inferior  extremities into the depressions on either side of the pyramidal process of  the os pedis.    _The Postero-lateral Ligaments_.--As mentioned when describing the first  interphalangeal articulation, these are in reality continuations of the  lateral ligaments of that joint. Running obliquely downwards and backwards  from their point of attachment to the first phalanx they curve round the  lower part of the side of the second phalanx and end on the extremities and  posterior surface of the navicular bone. Having reached that position, they  send short attachments to the retrossal process of the os pedis and to the  inner face of the lateral cartilage.

A large one  posteriorly running up behind the second phalanx to nearly adjoin the  sesamoidean bursae, and a small one, a prolongation of the synovial membrane  between the antero-lateral and postero-lateral ligaments of the same side.  This latter is often distended, and on account of its close proximity to  the seat of operation, is liable to be accidentally opened in excision of  the lateral cartilage for quittor.      C. THE TENDONS    In order to convey an intelligent understanding of the tendons it will be  wise to briefly describe the course of their parent muscles from their  commencement.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#4)"],[1,"sandals; some wear shoes, but trousers  are as rare as stovepipe hats. The native merchant goes to his  counting-room, the banker to his desk, the clergyman discourses  from a pulpit, the lawyer addresses the court, the professor  expounds to his students and the coolie carries his load, all  with limbs naked from the ankles to the thighs, and never more  than half-concealed by a muslin divided skirt.    The race, the caste and often the province of a resident of India  may be determined by his headgear. The Parsees wear tall fly-trap  hats made of horse hair, with a top like a cow's foot; the  Mohammedans wear the fez, and the Hindus the turban, and there  are infinite varieties of turbans, both in the material used  and in the manner in which they are put up. An old resident of  India can usually tell where a man comes from by looking at his  turban.          II    THE CITY OF BOMBAY    There are two cities in Bombay, the native city and the foreign  city. The foreign city spreads out over a large area, and, although  the population is only a small per cent of that of the native  city, it occupies a much larger space, which is devoted to groves,  gardens, lawns, and other breathing places and pleasure grounds,  while, as is the custom in the Orient, the natives are packed  away several hundred to the acre in tall houses, which, with  over-hanging balconies and tile roofs, line the crooked and narrow  streets on both sides. Behind some of these tall and narrow fronts,  however, are dwellings that cover a good deal of ground, being  much larger than the houses we are accustomed to, because the  Hindus have larger families and they all live together. When  a young man marries he brings his bride home to his father's  house, unless his mother-in-law happens to be a widow, when they  often take up their abode with her. But it is not common for  young couples to have their own homes; hence the dwellings in  the native quarters are packed with several generations of the  same family, and that makes the occupants easy prey to plagues,  famine and other agents of human destruction.    The Parsees love air and light, and many rich Hindus have followed  the foreign colony out into the suburbs, where you find a succession  of handsome villas or bungalows, as they are called, half-hidden by  high walls that inclose charming gardens. Some of these bungalows  are very attractive, some are even sumptuous in their  appointments--veritable palaces, filled with costly furniture  and ornaments--but the climate forbids the use of many of the  creature comforts which American and European taste demands. The  floors must be of tiles or cement and the curtains of bamboo,  because hangings, carpets, rugs and upholstery furnish shelter for  destructive and disagreeable insects, and the aim of everybody  is to secure as much air as possible without admitting the heat.    Bombay is justly proud of her public buildings. Few cities have  such a splendid array. None that I have ever visited except Vienna  can show an assemblage so imposing, with such harmony and artistic  uniformity combined with convenience of location, taste of  arrangement and general architectural effect. There is nothing,  of course, in Bombay that will compare with our Capitol or Library  at Washington, and its state and municipal buildings cannot compete  individually with the Parliament House in London, the Hotel de  Ville de Paris or the Palace of Justice in Brussels, or many  others I might name. But neither Washington nor London nor Paris  nor any other European or American city possesses such a broad,  shaded boulevard as Bombay, with the Indian Ocean upon one side  and on the other, stretching for a mile or more, a succession of  stately edifices. Vienna has the boulevard and the buildings,  but lacks the water effect. It is as if all the buildings of  the University of Chicago were scattered along the lake front  in Chicago from the river to Twelfth street.    The Bombay buildings are a mixture of Hindu, Gothic and Saracenic  architecture, blended with taste and success, and in the center,  to crown the group, rises a stately clock tower of beautiful  proportions. All of these buildings have been erected during  the last thirty years, the most of them with public money, many  by private munificence. The material is chiefly green and gray  stone. Each has ample approaches from all directions, which  contribute to the general effect, and is surrounded by large  grounds, so that it can be seen to advantage from any point of  view. Groves of full-grown trees furnish a noble background, and  wide lawns stretch before and between. There is parking along  the shore of the bay, then a broad drive, with two sidewalks, a  track for bicycles and a soft path for equestrians, all overhung  with far-stretching boughs of immense and ancient trees, which  furnish a grateful shade against the sun and add to the beauty  of the landscape. I do not know of any such driveway elsewhere,  and it extends for several miles, starting from an extensive  common or parade ground, which is given up to games and sports.  Poor people are allowed to camp there in tents in hot weather, for  there, if anywhere, they can keep cool, because the peninsula upon  which Bombay stands is narrow at that point, and if a breeze is  blowing from any direction they get it. At intervals the boulevard  is intersected by small, well-kept parks with band stands, and is  broken by walks, drives, beds of flowers, foliage, plants and  other landscape decorations; and this in the midst of a great  city.    On the inside of the boulevard, following the contour of the shore  of the bay, is first, Elphinstone College, then the Secretariat,  which is the headquarters of the government and contains several  state apartments of noble proportions and costly decorations. The  building is 443 feet long, with a tower 170 feet high. Next it  are the buildings of the University of Bombay, a library with a  tower 260 feet high, a convocation hall of beautiful design and  perfect proportions and other buildings. Then comes the Courts  of Justice; an immense structure nearly 600 feet long, with a  tower 175 feet high, which resembles the Law Courts of London,  and is as appropriate as it is imposing. The department of public  works has the next building; then the postoffice department, the  telegraph department, the state archives building and patent  office in order. The town hall contains several fine rooms and  important historic pictures. The mint is close to the town hall,  and next beyond it are the offices of the Port Trust, which would  correspond to our harbor commissioners. Then follow in order the  Holy Trinity Church, the High School, St. Xavier's College, the  Momey Institute, Wilson College, long rows of barracks, officers'  quarters and clubs, the Sailors' Home, several hospitals, a school  of art and Elphinstone High School, which is 452 by 370 feet in  size and one of the most palatial educational institutions I  have ever seen, the splendid group culminating in the Victoria  Railway station, which is the finest in the world and almost  as large as any we have in the United States.    [Illustration: VICTORIA RAILWAY STATION--BOMBAY]    It is a vast building of Italian Gothic, with oriental towers  and pinnacles, elaborately decorated with sculpture and carving,  and a large central dome surmounted by a huge bronze figure of  Progress. The architect was Mr. F. W. Stevens, a Bombay engineer;  it was finished in 1888 at a cost of $2,500,000, and the wood  carving, the tiles, the ornamental iron and brass railings, the  grills for the ticket offices, the restaurant and refreshment  rooms, the balustrades for the grand staircases, are all the  work of the students of the Bombay School of Art, which gives  it additional interest, although critics have contended that  the architecture and decorations are too ornate for the purpose  for which it is used.    Wilson College, one of the most imposing of the long line of  buildings, is a memorial to a great Scotch missionary who lived  a strenuous and useful life and impressed his principles and  his character upon the people of India in a remarkable manner.  He was famous for his common sense and accurate judgment; and  till the end of his days retained the respect and confidence of  every class of the community, from the viceroy and the council  of state down to the coolies that sweep the streets. All of them  knew and loved Dr. Wilson, and although he never ceased to preach  the gospel of Christ, his Master, with the energy, zeal and plain  speaking that is characteristic of Scotchmen, the Hindus,  Mohammedans, Parsees, Jains, Jews and every other sect admired  and encouraged him as much as those of his own faith.    One-fourth of all these buildings were presented to the city by  rich and patriotic residents, most of them Parsees and Hindus. The  Sailors' Home was the gift of the Maharajah of Baroda; University  Hall was founded by Sir Cowasjee Jehangir Readymoney, who also  built Elphinstone College. He placed the great fountain in front  of the cathedral, and, although a Parsee, built the spire on  the Church of St. John the Evangelist.    Mr. Dharmsala, another Parsee, built the Ophthalmic Hospital and  the European Strangers' Home and put drinking fountains about  the town. David Sassoon, a Persian Jew, founded the Mechanics'  Institute, and his brother, Sir Albert Sassoon, built the tower  of the Elphinstone High School. Mr. Premchand Raichand built  the university library and clock tower in memory of his mother.  Sir Jamsetji Jijibhal gave the school of art and the Parsee  Benevolent Institute; the sons of Jarahji Parak erected the  almshouse. Mr. Rustam Jamshidji founded the Hospital for Women,  the East India Company built the Town Hall and other men gave  other buildings with the greatest degree of public spirit and  patriotism I have ever seen"]]]
