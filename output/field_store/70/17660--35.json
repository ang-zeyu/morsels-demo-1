The first is a learned entomologist, who, hearing one evening at the  Linnean Society that a yellow Scarabaeus, otherwise beetle, of a very rare  kind was to be captured on the sands at Swansea, immediately took his seat  in the mail for that place, and brought back in triumph the object of his  desire. The second is Mr. David Douglas, who spent two years among the  wild Indians of the Rocky Mountains, was reduced to such extremities as  occasionally to sup upon the flaps of his saddle; and once, not having  this resource, was obliged to eat up all the seeds he had collected the  previous forty days in order to appease the cravings of nature. Not  appalled by these sufferings, he has returned again to endure similar  hardships, and all for a few simples. The third example is Mr. Drummond,  the assistant botanist to Franklin in his last hyperborean journey. In the  midst of snow, with the thermometer 15 deg. below zero, without a tent,  sheltered from the inclemency of the weather only by a hut built of the  branches of trees, and depending for subsistence from day to day on a  solitary Indian hunter, \"I obtained,\" says this amiable and enthusiastic  botanist, \"a few mosses; and, on Christmas day,\"--mark, gentle reader, the  day, of all others, as if it were a reward for his devotion,--\"I had the  pleasure of finding a very minute Gymnostomum, hitherto undescribed. I  remained alone for the rest of the winter, except when my man occasionally  visited me with meat; and I found the time hang very heavy, as I had no  books, and nothing could be done in the way of collecting specimens of  natural history.\"    _Magazine of Natural History_           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: BURIAL PLACE IN TONGATABU.]    This is another of Mr. Bennett's sketches made during his recent visit to  several of the Polynesian Islands. It represents the burial-place of the  Chiefs of Tongatabu: over this \"earthly prison of their bones,\" we may say  with Titus Andronicus:      In pence and honour rest you here my sons:    (The) readiest champions, repose you here,    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps:    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,    Here grow no damned grudges: here are no storms,    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.    Mr. Bennett thus describes the spot, with some interesting circumstances:    \"July 29th. I visited this morning a beautiful spot named Maofanga, at a  short distance from our anchorage; here was the burial-place of the chiefs.  The tranquillity of this secluded spot, and the drooping trees of the  casuarina equisetifolia, added to the mournful solemnity of the place.  Off this place, the Astrolabe French discovery ship lay when, some time  before, she fired on the natives. The circumstances respecting this affair,  as communicated to me, if correct, do not reflect much credit on the  commander of the vessel. They are as follow: During a gale the Astrolabe  drove on the reef, but was afterwards got off by the exertion of the  natives; some of the men deserting from the ship, the chiefs were accused  of enticing them away, and on the men not being given up the ship fired on  the village; the natives barricaded themselves on the beach by throwing up  sand heaps, and afterwards retired into the woods. The natives pointed out  the effects of the shot; on the trees, a large branch of a casuarina tree  in the sacred enclosure was shot off, several coco-nut trees were cut in  two, and the marks of several spent shots still remain on the trees: three  natives were killed in this attack. A great number of the flying-fox, or  vampire bat, hung from the casuarina trees in this enclosure, but the  natives interposed to prevent our firing at them, the place being tabued.  Mr. Turner had been witness to the interment here, not long previously, of  the wife of a chief, and allied to the royal family. The body, enveloped  in mats, was placed in a vault, in which some of her relations had been  before interred, and being covered up, several natives advanced with  baskets of sand, &c. and strewed it over the vault; others then approached  and cut themselves on the head with hatchets, wailing and showing other  demonstrations of grief. Small houses are erected over the vaults. All the  burial-places are either fenced round or surrounded by a low wall of coral  stones, and have a very clean, neat, and regular appearance.    \"I observed that nearly the whole of the natives whom I had seen, were  deficient in the joints of the little finger of the left hand, and some of  both; some of the first joint only, others two, and many the whole of both  fingers. On inquiry, I found that a joint is chopped off on any occasion  of the illness or death of a relation or chief, as a propitiatory offering  to the Spirit. There is a curious analogy between this custom and one  related by Mr. Burchell as existing among the Bushmen tribe in Southern  Africa, and performed for similar superstitious reasons to express grief  for the loss of relations.    \"Near this place was the Hufanga, or place of refuge, in which a person in  danger of being put to death is in safety as long as he remains there; on  looking in the enclosure, it was only a place gravelled over, in which was  a small house and some trees planted.\"[1]      [1] United Service Journal, Jan. 1832.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.      FRANCIS THE FIRST.    _An Historical Drama. By Frances Ann Kemble_.    This extraordinary production has awakened an interest in the dramatic and  literary world, scarcely equalled in our times. We know of its fortune  upon the stage by report only; but, from our acquaintance with the  requisites of the acting drama, we should conceive its permanence will be  more problematical in the theatre than in the closet; and considering the  conditions upon which dramatic fame is now attainable, we think the clever  authoress will not have reason to regret these inequalities of success.  That Miss Kemble's tragedy possesses points to be made, and passages that  will _tell_ on the stage, cannot be denied; but its interest for  representation requires to be concentrated; it \"wants a hero, an uncommon  thing.\" It is well observed in the _Quarterly Review_, (by the way, the  only notice yet taken of the tragedy, that merits attention,) that \"the  piece is crowded with characters of the greatest variety, all of  considerable importance in the piece, engaged in the most striking  situations, and contributing essentially to the main design. Instead of  that simple unity of interest, from which modern tragic writers have  rarely ventured to depart, it takes the wider range of that historic unity,  which is the characteristic of our elder drama; moulds together, and  connects by some common agent employed in both, incidents which have no  necessary connexion; and--what in the present tragedy strikes us as on  many accounts especially noticeable--unites by a fine though less  perceptible moral link, remote but highly tragic events with the immediate,  if we may so speak, the domestic interests of the play.\" This language is  finely characteristic of the drama. Again, the interest has \"so much  Shakspearianism in the conception as to afford a remarkable indication of  the noble school in which the young authoress has studied, and the high  models which, with courage, in the present day, fairly to be called  originality, she has dared to set before her. In fact, Francis the First  is cast entirely in the mould of one of Shakspeare's historical tragedies.\"  The drama too was written without any view to its representation, as the  _Quarterly_ reviewer has been \"informed by persons who long ago perused  the manuscript, several years before Miss Kemble appeared upon the stage,  and at a time when she little anticipated the probability that she herself  might be called upon to impersonate the conceptions of her own imagination.  We believe that we are quite safe when we state that the drama, in its  present form, was written when the authoress was not more than seventeen.\"  Yet it should be added that the above statement is not made by way of  extenuation; for, to say the truth, it needs no such adventitious aid.    A mere outline of the story will convince the reader that, as the Reviewer  states, \"the tragedy is alive from the beginning to the end;\" and our  extracts will we trust show the language to be bold and vigorous; the  imagery sweetly poetical; and the workings of the passions which actuate  the personages to be evidently of high promise if not of masterly spirit.    The tragedy opens with the recall of the Constable De Bourbon from Italy,  through the supposed political intrigue, but really, the secret love, of  the mother of Francis, Louisa of Savoy, Duchess of Angouleme, whom Miss  Kemble calls the Queen Mother. In the second scene the Queen Mother  communicates to Gonzales, a monk in disguise, but in, reality an emissary  of the Court of Spain, her secret passion for De Bourbon, and her design  in his recall.    Francis is introduced at a tourney, where he not only triumphs in the  jousts, but over the heart of the beautiful Francoise de Foix.    Bourbon returns, and the second act opens with his interview with Renee,  (or Margaret,) the daughter of the Queen Mother, and sister of Francis I.,  for whom he really entertains an affection. In the second scene the Queen  Mother declares her passion to Bourbon, who, at first supposes he is to be  tempted by Margaret's hand, but finding the Queen herself to be the lure,  he indignantly rejects her. The character of Bourbon in this scene is  admirably brought out. The artifice of the Queen--the scorn of  Bourbon--and the Queen's meditated vengeance are powerfully wrought:    BOURBON.

It stands upon a basalt rock, of a  triangular shape, high, rugged, and abrupt on the land side; flanked  by the German Ocean, and strong natural rampires of sand, matted  together with sea rushes on the east; and only accessible to an enemy  on the south-east, which is guarded by a deep, dry ditch, and a series  of towers in the wall, on each side of the gateway. Nature has mantled  the rock with lichens of various rich tints: its beetling brow is 150  feet above the level of the sea, upon a stratum of mouldering rock,  apparently scorched with violent heat, and having beneath it a close  flinty sandstone. Its crown is girt with walls and towers, which on  the land side have been nearly all repaired. The outer gateway stands  between two fine old towers, with time-worn heads; twelve paces within  it is a second gate, which is machicolated, and has a portcullis; and,  within this, on the left hand, on a lofty point of rock, is a very  ancient round tower of great strength; commanding a pass subject to  every annoyance from the besieged. This fort is believed to be of  Saxon origin. The keep stands on the area of the rock, having an open  space around it. It is square, and of that kind of building which  prevailed from the Conquest till about the time of our second Henry.  It had no chimney; but fires had been made in the middle of a large  room, which was lighted by a window near its top, three feet square.  All the other rooms were lighted by slit or loop holes, six inches  broad. The walls are of small stones, from a quarry at Sunderland on  the sea, three miles distant: within them is a draw well, discovered  in 1770, in clearing the cellar from sand and rubbish; its depth is  145 feet, cut through solid rock, of which seventy-five feet are of  whinstone. The remains of a chapel were discovered here, under a  prodigious mass of land, in the year 1773; its architecture was pure  Saxon, and the ancient font being found, was preserved in the keep.  The chapel has been rebuilt on the old foundations.    [Illustration: _(Bamborough Castle before the general repairs.)_]    The founder of the Castle is stated by Matthew of Westminster to have  been Ida, King of Northumberland. Sir Walter Scott sings      Thy tower, proud Bamborough, mark'd they         here,    King Ida's castle, huge and square,    From its tall rock look grimly down,    And on the swelling ocean frown.[4]        [4] Marmion.    It was destroyed by the Danes in 993; but about the time of the  Conquest was in good repair. In 1095, it was in the possession of  Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, when it was besieged, and,  after much difficulty, taken by William II. The castle lost the  greatest part of its beauty in a siege after the battle of Hexham.  Camden tells us \"from that time it has suffered by time and winds,  which throw up incredible quantities of sand from the sea upon its  walls, through the windows which are open.\" Sir John Forster was  governor of it in Elizabeth's reign; and his grandson John obtained  a grant of it and the manor from James the First. His descendant,  Thomas, forfeited it in 1715; but his maternal uncle, Nathaniel, Lord  Crewe, bishop of Durham, purchased his estates, and bequeathed them to  charitable purposes in 1720. The sunken rocks and shifting sands of  this coast had long been a terror to the mariners, but under his  lordship's will, Dr. Sharp, then archdeacon of Durham, fitted up the  keep of the Castle, for the reception of suffering seamen, and  of property which might be rescued from the fury of the ocean.  Regulations were also adopted, both to prevent accidents on the coast,  and to alleviate misfortunes when they had occurred. A nine pounder,  placed at the bottom of the great tower, gives signals to ships in  distress, and in case of a wreck, announces the same to the Custom  House officers and their servants, who hasten to prevent the wreck  being plundered. In addition to this, during a storm, horsemen patrol  the coast, and rewards are paid for the earliest intelligence of  vessels in distress. A flag is always hoisted when any ship is seen  in distress on the Fern Islands or Staples; or a rocket thrown up at  night, which gives notice to the Holy Island fishermen, who can put  off to the spot when no boat from the main can get over the breakers.  Life-boats have likewise been added to the establishment. The vast  increase of the residuary rents of the Castle estates also enables  the trustees to support within its walls two free-schools, a library,  infirmary, thirty beds for shipwrecked sailors, and a granary, whence  poor persons are supplied with provisions at the first price.[5]  Altogether, the establishment of Bamborough merits the epithet of  \"princely,\" which it has received from the historians of the county.  Its philanthropic endowment has not been suffered to decay with the  romance of olden time, but the charitable intentions of the testator  are fulfilled, so as to maintain a lasting record of his active  benevolence. Such magnificence may be said to eclipse all the glitter  and gleam of chivalry, and make them appear but as idle dreams.        [5] See _Mirror_, vol. xiii. p 415.--One of the best features of      the establishment is the gratuitous circulation of the library for      twenty miles round; the books being lent to any householder of      good report residing within twenty miles of the castle.    A boundless view of the ocean presents itself from the towers of  Bamborough Castle, studded with small islands, having the Coquet  Island on the south, and the Holy Island on the north.           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.           *       *       *       *       *    ORIGIN OF EPSOM RACES.      In a pleasant little volume modestly entitled _Some Particulars  relating to the History of Epsom_, the following facts are collected  with much diligence. At the present season, they may be acceptable to  our readers.    \"When these races first commenced, we have not been able with  certainty to trace. Few writers, who mention the district, do more  than simply state the fact, that horse races are annually held at  Epsom.    \"Whether they were at first periodical or occasional, we will not  presume to determine, though the latter is, we think, the most  probable.    \"Races, it is generally agreed, took their origin from, if they did  not give birth to, the Olympic games. The first information we have of  their existence in this country is in the reign of Henry II. At that  time, and for many ages afterwards, the sport must have been merely  a rude pastime, perhaps as destitute of the science of the present  system, as of the vices, which are too generally engendered by it.    \"There can be no doubt, that Epsom downs (or as they are frequently,  though erroneously written in old writings, Banstead downs) early  became the spot, upon which the lovers of racing indulged their fancy.  And, perhaps, the known partiality of King James I., for this species  of diversion, will justify us in ascribing their commencement to the  period when he resided at the palace of Nonsuch.    \"The following extract from Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, will  shew, that during the troubles of his unfortunate successor,  Charles I., races upon Epsom downs, were viewed as no uncommon  occurrence.--'Soon after the meeting, which was held at Guildford,  18th May, 1648, to address the two Houses of Parliament, that the  King, their only lawful sovereign, might be restored to his due  honors, and might come to his parliament for a personal treaty, &c.--a  meeting of the royalists was held on Banstead (Epsom) downs, under the  pretence of a horse race, and six hundred horses were collected and  marched to Reigate.'    \"King James had imbibed a predilection for horse races, before he  ascended the English throne; they were in high estimation in Scotland  during his minority, previously to which, the English parliament seem  to have turned their attention to the subject.    \"We find, that in the time of Henry VII. and his successors, Henry  VIII. and Elizabeth, several acts of parliament were made to prevent  the exportation of horses to Scotland, and other parts.    \"There is an entry in the Lord's Journal, June 15th, 1540--'At length,  the bill is read this day, for encouraging the breed of horses, of a  larger stature, and despatched with unanimous consent, and without a  dissenting voice.'    \"The great men of Elizabeth's reign, appear to have been fully  disposed to profit by the example and injunctions of her father.  Italian masters were invited over; the art of managing horses became  an universal accomplishment, among the nobility and gentry of England;  but most of the professors, both of equitation and farriery, were  foreigners.    \"Horses were not yet kept exclusively for the purpose of running  races, but gentlemen matched their hunters or hacknies, and usually  rode the race themselves.    \"The most fashionable trial, however, of the speed and goodness of  their horses, was hunting red herrings, or 'the train scent,' as  it was then called, from the body of some animal, which had been  previously drawn across hedge and ditch. Here the scent was certain  and strong, and the hounds would run upon it to the end, with their  utmost speed. The matched horses followed these hounds, and to be  in with them, was generally accounted a very satisfactory proof of  goodness.    \"Markham, and that celebrated riding master, Michael Baret, describe,  also, another mode of running matches across the country in those days  denominated the wild goose chase; an imitation of which has continued  in occasional use, "]]]
