These little groupings of  bubbles so formed are the atoms of the second of the interpenetrating  worlds. The whole number of the bubbles is not used in this way, sufficient  being left in the dissociated state to act as atoms for the first and  highest of these worlds. In due time comes the second impulse, which seizes  upon nearly all these forty-nine bubble-atoms (leaving only enough to  provide atoms for the second world), draws them back into itself and then,  throwing them out again, sets up among them vortices, each of which holds  within itself 2,401 bubbles (49^2). These form the atoms of the third  world. Again after a time comes a third impulse, which in the same way  seizes upon nearly all these 2,401 bubble-atoms, draws them back again into  their original form, and again throws them outward once more as the atoms  of the fourth world--each atom containing this time 49^{3} bubbles. This  process is repeated until the sixth of these successive impulses has built  the atom of the seventh or the lowest world--that atom containing 49^{6} of  the original bubbles.    This atom of the seventh world is the ultimate atom of the physical  world--not any of the atoms of which chemists speak, but that ultimate out  of which all their atoms are made. We have at this stage arrived at that  condition of affairs in which the vast whirling sphere contains within  itself seven types of matter, all one in essence, because all built of the  same kind of bubbles, but differing in their degree of density. All these  types are freely intermingled, so that specimens of each type would be  found in a small portion of the sphere taken at random in any part of it,  with, however, a general tendency of the heavier atoms to gravitate more  and more towards the centre.    The seventh impulse sent out from the Third Aspect of the Deity does not,  as before, draw back the physical atoms which were last made into the  original dissociated bubbles, but draws them together into certain  aggregations, thus making a number of different kinds of what may be called  proto-elements, and these again are joined together into the various forms  which are known to science as chemical elements. The making of these  extends over a long period of ages, and they are made in a certain definite  order by the interaction of several forces, as is correctly indicated in  Sir William Crookes's paper, _The Genesis of the Elements_. Indeed the  process of their making is not even now concluded; uranium is the latest  and heaviest element so far as we know, but others still more complicated  may perhaps be produced in the future.    As ages rolled on the condensation increased, and presently the stage of a  vast glowing nebula was reached. As it cooled, still rapidly rotating, it  flattened into a huge disc and gradually broke up into rings surrounding a  central body--an arrangement not unlike that which Saturn exhibits at the  present day, though on a far larger scale. As the time drew near when the  planets would be required for the purposes of evolution, the Deity sets up  somewhere in the thickness of each ring a subsidiary vortex into which a  great deal of the matter of the ring was by degrees collected. The  collisions of the gathered fragments caused a revival of the heat, and the  resulting planet was for a long time a mass of glowing gas. Little by  little it cooled once more, until it became fit to be the theatre of life  such as ours. Thus were all the planets formed.    Almost all the matter of those interpenetrating worlds was by this time  concentrated into the newly formed planets. Each of them was and is  composed of all those different kinds of matter. The earth upon which we  are now living is not merely a great ball of physical matter, built of the  atoms of that lowest world, but has also attached to it an abundant supply  of matter of the sixth, the fifth, the fourth and other worlds. It is well  known to all students of science that particles of matter never actually  touch one another, even in the hardest of substances. The spaces between  them are always far greater in proportion than their own size--enormously  greater. So there is ample room for all the other kinds of atoms of all  those other worlds, not only to lie between the atoms of the denser matter,  but to move quite freely among them and around them. Consequently, this  globe upon which we live is not one world, but seven interpenetrating  worlds, all occupying the same space, except that the finer types of matter  extend further from the centre than does the denser matter.    We have given names to these interpenetrating worlds for convenience in  speaking of them. No name is needed for the first, as man is not yet in  direct connection with it; but when it is necessary to mention it, it may  be called the divine world. The second is described as the monadic, because  in it exist those Sparks of the divine Life which we call the human Monads;  but neither of these can be touched by the highest clairvoyant  investigations at present possible for us. The third sphere, whose atoms  contain 2,401 bubbles, is called the spiritual world, because in it  functions the highest Spirit in man as now constituted. The fourth is the  intuitional world, [Previously called in Theosophical literature the  buddhic plane.] because from it come the highest intuitions. The fifth is  the mental world, because from its matter is built the mind of man. The  sixth is called the emotional or astral world, because the emotions of man  cause undulations in its matter. (The name astral was given to it by  mediaeval alchemists, because its matter is starry or shining as compared to  that of the denser world.) The seventh world, composed of the type of  matter which we see all around us, is called the physical.    The matter of which all these interpenetrating worlds are built is  essentially the same matter, but differently arranged and of different  degrees of density. Therefore the rates at which these various types of  matter normally vibrate differ also. They may be considered as a vast gamut  of undulations consisting of many octaves. The physical matter uses a  certain number of the lowest of these octaves, the astral matter another  group of octaves just above that, the mental matter a still further group,  and so on.    Not only has each of these worlds its own type of matter; it has also its  own set of aggregations of that matter--its own substances. In each world  we arrange these substances in seven classes according to the rate at which  their molecules vibrate. Usually, but not invariably, the slower  oscillation involves also a larger molecule--a molecule, that is, built up  by a special arrangement of the smaller molecules of the next higher  subdivision. The application of heat increases the size of the molecules  and also quickens and amplifies their undulation, so that they cover more  ground, and the object, as a whole expands, until the point is reached  where the aggregation of molecules breaks up, and the latter passes from  one condition to that next above it. In the matter of the physical world  the seven subdivisions are represented by seven degrees of density of  matter, to which, beginning from below upwards, we give the names solid,  liquid, gaseous, etheric, superetheric, subatomic and atomic.    The atomic subdivision is one in which all forms are built by the  compression into certain shapes of the physical atoms, without any previous  collection of these atoms into blocks or molecules. Typifying the physical  ultimate atom for the moment by a brick, any form in the atomic subdivision  would be made by gathering together some of the bricks, and building them  into a certain shape. In order to make matter for the next lower  subdivision, a certain number of the bricks (atoms) would first be gathered  together and cemented into small blocks of say four bricks each, five  bricks each, six bricks or seven bricks; and then these blocks so made  would be used as building stones. For the next subdivision several of the  blocks of the second subdivision cemented together in certain shapes would  form building-stones, and so on to the lowest.    To transfer any substance from the solid condition to the liquid (that is  to say, to melt it) is to increase the vibration of its compound molecules  until at last they are shaken apart into the simpler molecules of which  they were built. This process can in all cases be repeated again and again  until finally any and every physical substance can be reduced to the  ultimate atoms of the physical world.    Each of these worlds has its inhabitants, whose senses are normally capable  of responding to the undulations of their own world only. A man living (as  we are all doing) in the physical world sees, hears, feels, by vibrations  connected with the physical matter around him. He is equally surrounded by  the astral and mental and other worlds which are interpenetrating his own  denser world, but of them he is normally unconscious, because his senses  cannot respond to the oscillations of their matter, just as our physical  eyes cannot see by the vibrations of ultra-violet light, although  scientific experiments show that they exist, and there are other  consciousnesses with differently-formed organs who _can_ see by them. A  being living in the astral world might be occupying the very same space as  a being living in the physical world, yet each would be entirely  unconscious of the other and would in no way impede the free movement of  the other. The same is true of all other worlds. We are at this moment  surrounded by these worlds of finer matter, as close to us as the world we  see, and their inhabitants are passing through us and about us, but we are  entirely unconscious of them."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"s.

The journey northward in 1831 originated in one of those fabulous tales  which occasionally become current in the colony of New South Wales,  respecting the interior country, still unexplored.    A runaway convict named George Clarke, alias The Barber, had, for a  length of time escaped the vigilance of the police by disguising himself  as an aboriginal native. He had even accustomed himself to the wretched  life of that unfortunate race of men; he was deeply scarified like them  and naked and painted black, he went about with a tribe, being usually  attended by two aboriginal females, and having acquired some knowledge of  their language and customs.    But this degenerate white man was not content with the solitary freedom  of the savage life and his escape from a state of servitude. He had  assumed the cloak and colour of the savage that he might approach the  dwellings of the colonists, and steal with less danger of detection. In  conjunction with the simple aborigines whom he misled, and with several  other runaway convicts he had organised a system of cattle stealing,  which was coming into extensive operation on Liverpool plains when,  through the aid of some of the natives, who have in general assisted the  detection of bushrangers, he was at length discovered and captured by the  police.    After this man was taken into custody, he gave a circumstantial detail of  his travels to the north-west along the bank of a large river, named, as  he said, the Kindur; by following which in a south-west direction he had  twice reached the seashore. He described the tribes inhabiting the banks  of the Kindur and gave the names of their chiefs. He said that he had  first crossed vast plains named Balyran, and, on approaching the sea, he  had seen a burning mountain named Courada. He described, with great  apparent accuracy, the courses of the known streams of the northern  interior which united, as he stated, in the Namoi, a river first  mentioned by him; and, according to his testimony, Peel's river entered  the Namoi by flowing westward from where Mr. Oxley had crossed it.    Now this was contrary to the course assigned to the Peel in the maps by  early travellers, but consistent nevertheless with more recent surveys.  Vague accounts of a great river beyond Liverpool plains, flowing  north-west, were current about the time General Darling embarked for  England. The attention of the acting governor, Colonel Lindesay, was  particularly drawn to the question by this report of Clarke, and also by  the subsequent proposals of various persons, to conduct any expedition  sent in search of the great river.    PLAN OF EXPLORATION.    There are few undertakings more attractive to the votaries of fame or  lovers of adventure than the exploration of unknown regions; but Sir  Patrick Lindesay, with due regard to the responsibility which my office  seemed to impose upon me, as successor to Mr. Oxley, at once accepted my  proffered services to conduct a party into the interior.    The principal object of my plan was the exploration of Australia, so that  whether the report of the river proved true or false, the results of the  expedition would be, at least, useful in affording so much additional  information; equally important geographically, whether positive or  negative.    After I had surveyed extensive tracts of territory I never could separate  the question respecting the course of any river from that of the  situation of the higher land necessary to furnish its sources and confine  its basin. I could not entertain the idea of a river distinct from these  conditions, so necessary to the existence of one; and it appeared to me  that if a large river flowed to the north-west of any point north of  Liverpool plains its sources could only be sought for in the Coast Range  in the opposite direction; or to the eastward of these plains.    Various rivers were known to arise on that side of the Coast Range; the  streams from Liverpool plains flowing northward; the Peel, the Gwydir,  and the Dumaresq, arising in the Coast Range, and falling, as had been  represented, to the north-westward. I proposed therefore to proceed  northward, or to pursue such a direction as well as the nature of the  country permitted, so that I might arrive, on the most northern of these  streams, and then, keeping in view whatever high land might be visible  near its northern banks, to trace the river's course downwards, and thus  to arrive at the large river, or common channel of all these waters.    The second condition necessary to the existence of a river, namely, the  higher land enclosing its basin, might, in this case, have been either  Arbuthnot's Range, or that between the Darling and the Lachlan; and this  seemed to me to involve a question of at least equal importance to that  of the river itself, for, had the"]]]
