But Nelly's looks are blythe and sweet,       And what is best of a',       Her reputation is complete,       And fair without a flaw.         She dresses aye sae clean and neat,       Both decent and genteel;       And then there's something in her gait       Gars ony dress look weel.         A gaudy dress and gentle air       May slightly touch the heart;       But it's innocence and modesty       That polishes the dart.         'Tis this in Nelly pleases me,       'Tis this enchants my soul;       For absolutely in my breast       She reigns without control.          Song--O Tibbie, I Hae Seen The Day         Tune--\"Invercauld's Reel, or Strathspey.\"           Choir.--O Tibbie, I hae seen the day,       Ye wadna been sae shy;       For laik o' gear ye lightly me,       But, trowth, I care na by.         Yestreen I met you on the moor,       Ye spak na, but gaed by like stour;       Ye geck at me because I'm poor,       But fient a hair care I.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         When coming hame on Sunday last,       Upon the road as I cam past,       Ye snufft and ga'e your head a cast--       But trowth I care't na by.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         I doubt na, lass, but ye may think,       Because ye hae the name o' clink,       That ye can please me at a wink,       Whene'er ye like to try.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         But sorrow tak' him that's sae mean,       Altho' his pouch o' coin were clean,       Wha follows ony saucy quean,       That looks sae proud and high.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         Altho' a lad were e'er sae smart,       If that he want the yellow dirt,       Ye'll cast your head anither airt,       And answer him fu' dry.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         But, if he hae the name o' gear,       Ye'll fasten to him like a brier,       Tho' hardly he, for sense or lear,       Be better than the kye.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         But, Tibbie, lass, tak' my advice:       Your daddie's gear maks you sae nice;       The deil a ane wad speir your price,       Were ye as poor as I.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.         There lives a lass beside yon park,       I'd rather hae her in her sark,       Than you wi' a' your thousand mark;       That gars you look sae high.       O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, &c.          Song--I Dream'd I Lay         I dream'd I lay where flowers were springing       Gaily in the sunny beam;       List'ning to the wild birds singing,       By a falling crystal stream:       Straight the sky grew black and daring;       Thro' the woods the whirlwinds rave;       Tress with aged arms were warring,       O'er the swelling drumlie wave.         Such was my life's deceitful morning,       Such the pleasures I enjoyed:       But lang or noon, loud tempests storming       A' my flowery bliss destroy'd.       Tho' fickle fortune has deceiv'd me--       She promis'd fair, and perform'd but ill,       Of mony a joy and hope bereav'd me--       I bear a heart shall support me still.

The prosperous man is asleep,       Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep;       But Misery and I must watch       The surly tempest blow:       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!         There lies the dear partner of my breast;       Her cares for a moment at rest:       Must I see thee, my youthful pride,       Thus brought so very low!       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!         There lie my sweet babies in her arms;       No anxious fear their little hearts alarms;       But for their sake my heart does ache,       With many a bitter throe:       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!         I once was by Fortune carest:       I once could relieve the distrest:       Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd       My fate will scarce bestow:       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!         No comfort, no comfort I have!       How welcome to me were the grave!       But then my wife and children dear--       O, wither would they go!       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!         O whither, O whither shall I turn!       All friendless, forsaken, forlorn!       For, in this world, Rest or Peace       I never more shall know!       And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!          Tragic Fragment         All devil as I am--a damned wretch,       A hardened, stubborn, unrepenting villain,       Still my heart melts at human wretchedness;       And with sincere but unavailing sighs       I view the helpless children of distress:       With tears indignant I behold the oppressor       Rejoicing in the honest man's destruction,       Whose unsubmitting heart was all his crime.--       Ev'n you, ye hapless crew! I pity you;       Ye, whom the seeming good think sin to pity;       Ye poor, despised, abandoned vagabonds,       Whom Vice, as usual, has turn'd o'er to ruin.       Oh! but for friends and interposing Heaven,       I had been driven forth like you forlorn,       The most detested, worthless wretch among you!       O injured God! Thy goodness has endow'd me       With talents passing most of my compeers,       Which I in just proportion have abused--       As far surpassing other common villains       As Thou in natural parts has given me more.

When o'er the hill beat surly storms,       And winter nights were dark and rainy;       I'd seek some dell, and in my arms       I'd shelter dear Montgomerie's Peggy.

Lovell at once  accepted the count of Priest and the corporal; and the delivery,  which, as I learned during the interpreting that followed, was to be  sealed with a supper that night in Brownsville, was consummated.  Lovell was compelled to leave us, to make the final payment for the  herd, and we would not see him again for some time. They were all  seated in the vehicle ready to start for town, when the cowman said to  his foreman,--    \"Now, Jim, I can't give you any pointers on handling a herd, but you  have until the 10th day of September to reach the Blackfoot Agency. An  average of fifteen miles a day will put you there on time, so don't  hurry. I'll try and see you at Dodge and Ogalalla on the way. Now,  live well, for I like your outfit of men. Your credit letter is good  anywhere you need supplies, and if you want more horses on the trail,  buy them and draft on me through your letter of credit. If any of your  men meet with accident or get sick, look out for them the same as you  would for yourself, and I'll honor all bills. And don't be stingy over  your expense account, for if that herd don't make money, you and I had  better quit cows.\"    I had been detained to do any interpreting needful, and at parting  Lovell beckoned to me. When I rode alongside the carriage, he gave me  his hand and said,--    \"Flood tells me to-day that you're a brother of Bob Quirk. Bob is to  be foreman of my herd that I'm putting up in Nueces County. I'm glad  you're here with Jim, though, for it's a longer trip. Yes, you'll get  all the circus there is, and stay for the concert besides. They say  God is good to the poor and the Irish; and if that's so, you'll pull  through all right. Good-by, son.\" And as he gave me a hearty, ringing  grip of the hand, I couldn't help feeling friendly toward him, Yankee  that he was.    After Lovell and the dons had gone, Flood ordered McCann to move his  wagon back from the river about a mile. It was now too late in the day  to start the herd, and we wanted to graze them well, as it was our  first night with them. About half our outfit grazed them around on a  large circle, preparatory to bringing them up to the bed ground as it  grew dusk. In the untrammeled freedom of the native range, a cow or  steer will pick old dry grass on which to lie down, and if it is  summer, will prefer an elevation sufficient to catch any passing  breeze. Flood was familiar with the habits of cattle, and selected a  nice elevation on which the old dry grass of the previous summer's  growth lay matted like a carpet.    Our saddle horses by this time were fairly well broken to camp life,  and, with the cattle on hand, night herding them had to be abandoned.  Billy Honeyman, however, had noticed several horses that were inclined  to stray on day herd, and these few leaders were so well marked in his  memory that, as a matter of precaution, he insisted on putting a rope  hobble on them. At every noon and night camp we strung a rope from the  hind wheel of our wagon and another from the end of the wagon tongue  back to stakes driven in the ground or held by a man, forming a  triangular corral. Thus in a few minutes, under any conditions, we  could construct a temporary corral for catching a change of mounts, or  for the wrangler to hobble untrustworthy horses. On the trail all  horses are free at night, except the regular night ones, which are  used constantly during the entire trip, and under ordinary conditions  keep strong and improve in flesh.    Before the herd was brought in for the night, and during the supper  hour, Flood announced the guards for the trip. As the men usually  bunked in pairs, the foreman chose them as they slept, but was under  the necessity of splitting two berths of bedfellows. \"Rod\" Wheat, Joe  Stallings, and Ash Borrowstone were assigned to the first guard, from  eight to ten thirty P.M. Bob Blades, \"Bull\" Durham, and Fox  Quarternight were given second guard, from ten thirty to one. Paul  Priest, John Officer, and myself made up the third watch, from one to  three thirty. The Rebel and I were bunkies, and this choice of guards,  while not ideal, was much better than splitting bedfellows and having  them annoy each other by going out and returning from guard  separately. The only fault I ever found with Priest was that he could  use the poorest judgment in selecting a bed ground for our blankets,  and always talked and told stories to me until I fell asleep. He was a  light sleeper himself, while I, being much younger, was the reverse.  The fourth and last guard, from three thirty until relieved after  daybreak, fell to Wyatt Roundtree, Quince Forrest, and \"Moss\"  Strayhorn. Thus the only men in the outfit not on night duty were  Honeyman, our horse wrangler, Barney McCann, our cook, and Flood, the  foreman. The latter, however, made up by riding almost double as much  as any man in his outfit. He never left the herd until it was bedded  down for the night, and we could always hear him quietly arousing the  cook and horse wrangler an hour before daybreak. He always kept a  horse on picket for the night, and often took the herd as it left the  bed ground at clear dawn.    A half hour before dark, Flood and all the herd men turned out to bed  down the cattle for our first night. They had been well grazed after  counting, and as they came up to the bed ground there was not a hungry  or thirsty animal in the lot. All seemed anxious to lie down, and by  circling around slowly, while gradually closing in, in the course of  half an hour all were bedded nicely on possibly five or six acres. I  remember there were a number of muleys among the cattle, and these  would not venture into the compact herd until the others had lain  down. Being hornless, instinct taught them to be on the defensive, and  it was noticeable that they were the first to arise in the morning, in  advance of their horned kin. When all had lain down, Flood and the  first guard remained, the others returning to the wagon.    The guards ride in a circle about four rods outside the sleeping  cattle, and by riding in opposite directions make it impossible for  any animal to make its escape without being noticed by the riders. The  guards usually sing or whistle continuously, so that the sleeping herd  may know that a friend and not an enemy is keeping vigil over their  dreams. A sleeping herd of cattle make a pretty picture on a clear  moonlight night, chewing their cuds and grunting and blowing over  contented stomachs. The night horses soon learn their duty, and a  rider may fall asleep or doze along in the saddle, but the horses will  maintain their distance in their leisurely, sentinel rounds.    On returning to the wagon, Priest and I picketed our horses, saddled,  where we could easily find them in the darkness, and unrolled our bed.  We had two pairs of blankets each, which, with an ordinary wagon sheet  doubled for a tarpaulin, and coats and boots for pillows, completed  our couch. We slept otherwise in our clothing worn during the day, and  if smooth, sandy ground was available on which to spread our bed, we  had no trouble in sleeping the sleep that long hours in the saddle  were certain to bring. With all his pardonable faults, The Rebel was a  good bunkie and a hail companion, this being his sixth trip over the  trail. He had been with Lovell over a year before the two made the  discovery that they had been on opposite sides during the \"late  unpleasantness.\" On making this discovery, Lovell at once rechristened  Priest \"The Rebel,\" and that name he always bore. He was fifteen years  my senior at this time, a wonderfully complex nature, hardened by  unusual experiences into a character the gamut of whose moods ran from  that of a good-natured fellow to a man of unrelenting severity in  anger.    We were sleeping a nine knot gale when Fox Quarternight of the second  guard called us on our watch. It was a clear, starry night, and our  guard soon passed, the cattle sleeping like tired soldiers. When the  last relief came on guard and we had returned to our blankets, I  remember Priest telling me this little incident as I fell asleep.    \"I was at a dance once in Live Oak County, and there was a stuttering  fellow there by the name of Lem Todhunter. The girls, it seems, didn't  care to dance with him, and pretended they couldn't understand him. He  had asked every girl at the party, and received the same answer from  each--they couldn't understand him. 'W-w-w-ell, g-g-g-go to hell,  then. C-c-c-can y-y-you understand that?' he said to the last girl,  and her brother threatened to mangle him horribly if he didn't  apologize, to which he finally agreed. He went back into the house and  said to the girl, 'Y-y-you n-n-n-needn't g-g-g-go to hell; y-y-your  b-b-b-brother and I have m-m-made other 'r-r-r-rangements.'\"        CHAPTER III    THE START    On the morning of April 1, 1882, our Circle Dot herd started on its  long tramp to the Blackfoot Agency in Montana. With six men on each  side, and the herd strung out for three quarters of a mile, it could  only be compared to some mythical serpent or Chinese dragon, as it  moved forward on its sinuous, snail-like course. Two riders, known as  point men, rode out and well back from the lead cattle, and by riding  forward and closing in as occasion required, directed the course of  the herd. The main body of the herd trailed along behind the leaders  like an army in loose marching order, guarded by outriders, known as  swing men, who rode well out from the advancing column, warding off  range cattle and seeing that none of the herd wandered away or dropped  out. There was no driving to do; the cattle moved of their own free  will as in ordinary travel. Flood seldom gave orders; but, as a number  of us had never worked on the trail before,"]]]
