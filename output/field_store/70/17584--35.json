[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#4)"],[1,"figure of this movement in Palestine was, without doubt,  the German Consul at Haifa, Leutweld von Hardegg. He traveled about the  country, making speeches, and distributing pamphlets in Arabic, in which  it was elaborately proved that Germans are not Christians, like the  French or English, but that they are descendants of the prophet  Mohammed. Passages from the Koran were quoted, prophesying the coming of  the Kaiser as the Savior of Islam.          CHAPTER IV    ROAD-MAKING AND DISCHARGE      The news of the actual declaration of war by Turkey caused a tremendous  stir in our regiment. The prevailing feeling was one of great  restlessness and discontent. The Arabs made many bitter remarks against  Germany. \"Why didn't she help us against the Italians during the war for  Tripoli?\" they said. \"Now that she is in trouble she is drawing us into  the fight.\" Their opinions, however, soon underwent a change. In the  first place, they came to realize that Turkey had taken up arms against  Russia; and Russia is considered first and foremost the arch-enemy.  German reports of German successes also had a powerful effect on them.  They began to grow boastful, arrogant; and the sight of the plundering  of Europeans, Jews, and Christians convinced them that a very desirable  regime was setting in. Saffed has a large Jewish colony, and it was  torment for me to have to witness the outrages that my people suffered  in the name of \"requisitioning.\"    The final blow came one morning when all the Jewish and Christian  soldiers of our regiment were called out and told that henceforth they  were to serve in the _taboor amlieh_, or working corps. The object of  this action, plainly enough, was to conciliate and flatter the  Mohammedan population, and at the same time to put the Jews and  Christians, who for the most part favored the cause of the Allies, in a  position where they would be least dangerous. We were disarmed; our  uniforms were taken away, and we became hard-driven \"gangsters.\" I shall  never forget the humiliation of that day when we, who, after all, were  the best-disciplined troops of the lot, were first herded to our work of  pushing wheelbarrows and handling spades, by grinning Arabs, rifle on  shoulder. We were set to building the road between Saffed and Tiberias,  on the Sea of Galilee--a link in the military highway from Damascus to  the coast, which would be used for the movement of troops in case the  railroad should be cut off. It had no immediate strategic bearing on the  attack against Suez, however.    From six in the morning till seven at night we were hard at it, except  for one hour's rest at noon. While we had money, it was possible to get  some slight relief by bribing our taskmasters; but this soon came to an  end, and we had to endure their brutality as best we could. The  wheelbarrows we used were the property of a French company which,  before the war, was undertaking a highway to Beirut. No grease was  provided for the wheels, so that there was a maddening squeaking and  squealing in addition to the difficulty of pushing the barrows. One day  I suggested to an inspection officer that if the wheels were not greased  the axles would be burned out. He agreed with me and issued an order  that the men were to provide their own oil to lubricate the wheels!    I shall not dwell on the physical sufferings we underwent while working  on this road, for the reason that the conditions I have described were  prevalent over the whole country; and later, when I had the opportunity  to visit some construction camps in Samaria and Judaea found that in  comparison our lot had been a happy one. While we were breaking stones  and trundling squeaking wheelbarrows, however, the most disquieting  rumors began to drift in to us from our home villages. Plundering had  been going on in the name of \"requisitioning\"; the country was full of  soldiery whose capacity for mischief-making was well known to us, and it  was torture to think of what might be happening in our peaceful homes  where so few men had been left for protection. All the barbed-wire  fences, we heard, had been torn up and sent north for the construction  of barricades. In a wild land like Palestine, where the native has no  respect for property, where fields and crops are always at the mercy of  marauders, the barbed-wire fence has been a tremendous factor for  civilization, and with these gone the Arabs were once more free to sweep  across the country unhindered, stealing and destroying.    The situation grew more and more unbearable. One day a little Christian  soldier--a Nazarene--disappeared from the ranks. We never saw him again,  but we learned that his sister, a very young girl, had been forcibly  taken by a Turkish officer of the Nazareth garrison. In Palestine, the  dishonor of a girl can be redeemed by blood alone. The young soldier had  hunted for his sister, found her in the barracks, and shot her; he then  surrendered himself to the military authorities, who undoubtedly put him  to death. He had not dared to kill the real criminal,--the officer,--for  he knew that this would not only bring death to his family, but would  call down terrible suffering on all the Christians of Nazareth.    [ILLUSTRATION: NAZARETH, FROM THE NORTHEAST]    When I learned of this tragedy, I determined to get out of the army and  return to my village at all costs. Nine Turkish officers out of ten can  be bought, and I had reason to know that the officer in command at  Saffed was not that tenth man. Now, according to the law of the country,  a man has the right to purchase exemption from military service for a  sum equivalent to two hundred dollars. My case was different, for I was  already enrolled; but everything is possible in Turkey. I set to work,  and in less than two weeks I had bought half a dozen officers, ranging  from corporal to captain, and had obtained consent of the higher  authorities to my departure, provided I could get a physician's  certificate declaring me unfit for service.    This was arranged in short order, although I am healthy-looking and the  doctor found some difficulty in hitting on an appropriate ailment.  Finally he decided that I had \"too much blood\"--whatever that might  mean. With his certificate in hand, I paid the regular price of two  hundred dollars from funds which had been sent me by my family, and  walked out of the barracks a free man. My happiness was mingled with  sadness at the thought of leaving the comrades with whom I had suffered  and hoped. The four boys from my village were splendid. They felt that I  was right in going home to do what I could for the people, but when they  kissed me good-bye, in the Eastern fashion, the tears were running down  their cheeks; and they were all strong, brave fellows.    On my way back to Zicron-Jacob, I passed through the town of Sheff'amr,  where I got a foretaste of the conditions I was to find at home. A  Turkish soldier, sauntering along the street, helped himself to fruit  from the basket of an old vender, and went on without offering to pay a  farthing. When the old man ventured to protest, the soldier turned like  a flash and began beating him mercilessly, knocking him down and  battering him until he was bruised, bleeding, and covered with the mud  of the street. There was a hubbub; a crowd formed, through which a  Turkish officer forced his way, demanding explanations. The soldier  sketched the situation in a few words, whereupon the officer, turning to  the old man, said impressively,--\"If a soldier of the Sultan should  choose to heap filth on your head, it is for you to kiss his hand in  gratitude.\"          CHAPTER V    THE HIDDEN ARMS      When I finally reached Zicron-Jacob, I found rather a sad state of  affairs. Military law had been declared. No one was supposed to be seen  in the streets after sundown. The village was full of soldiers, and  civilians had to put up with all kinds of ill-treatment. Moreover, our  people were in a state of great excitement because an order had recently  come from the Turkish authorities bidding them surrender whatever  fire-arms or weapons they had in their possession. A sinister command,  this: we knew that similar measures had been taken before the terrible  Armenian massacres, and we felt that some such fate might be in  preparation for our people. With the arms gone, the head men of the  village knew that our last hold over the Arabs, our last chance for  defense against sudden violence, would be gone, and they had refused to  give them up. A house-to-house search had been made--fruitlessly, for  our little arsenal was safely cached in a field, beneath growing grain.    It was a tense, unpleasant situation. At any time the Turks might decide  to back up their demand by some of the violent methods of which they  are past masters. A family council was held in my home, and it was  decided to send my sister, a girl of twenty-three, to some friends at  the American Syrian Protestant College at Beirut, so that we might be  able to move freely without the responsibility of having a girl at home,  in a country where, as a matter of course, the women-folk are seized and  carried off before a massacre. At Beirut we knew that there was an  American Consul-General, who kept in continual touch with the battleship  anchored in the harbor for the protection of American interests.    My sister got away none too soon. One evening shortly after her  departure, when I was standing in the doorway of our house watching the  ever fresh miracle of the Eastern sunset, a Turkish officer came riding  down the street with about thirty cavalrymen. He called me out and  ordered me to follow him to the little village inn, where he dismounted  and led me to one of the inner rooms, his spurs jingling loudly as we  passed along the stone corridor.    I never knew whether I had been selected for this attention because of  my prominence as a leader of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#4)"],[1,"are not ready yet,' she said, 'they're not rinsed,'  and she grabbed the basket and held it away from me. The things looked  the same to me as the rest on the line; they looked rinsed enough and  blued too. I reckoned that she didn't want me to take the trouble, or  thought that I mightn't like to be seen hanging out clothes, and was  only doing it out of kindness.    'Oh, it's no trouble,' I said, 'let me hang 'em out. I like it. I've  hung out clothes at home on a windy day,' and I made a reach into the  basket. But she flushed red, with temper I thought, and snatched the  basket away.    'Excuse me, Mr Wilson,' she said, 'but those things are not ready yet!'  and she marched into the wash-house.    'Ah well! you've got a little temper of your own,' I thought to myself.    When I told Jack, he said that I'd made another fool of myself. He said  I'd both disappointed and offended her. He said that my line was to  stand off a bit and be serious and melancholy in the background.    That evening when we'd started home, we stopped some time yarning with  a chap we met at the gate; and I happened to look back, and saw Mary  hanging out the rest of the things--she thought that we were out of  sight. Then I understood why those things weren't ready while we were  round.    For the next day or two Mary didn't take the slightest notice of me,  and I kept out of her way. Jack said I'd disillusioned her--and hurt her  dignity--which was a thousand times worse. He said I'd spoilt the thing  altogether. He said that she'd got an idea that I was shy and poetic,  and I'd only shown myself the usual sort of Bush-whacker.    I noticed her talking and chatting with other fellows once or twice, and  it made me miserable. I got drunk two evenings running, and then, as it  appeared afterwards, Mary consulted Jack, and at last she said to him,  when we were together--    'Do you play draughts, Mr Barnes?'    'No,' said Jack.    'Do you, Mr Wilson?' she asked, suddenly turning her big, bright eyes on  me, and speaking to me for the first time since last washing-day.    'Yes,' I said, 'I do a little.' Then there was a silence, and I had to  say something else.    'Do you play draughts, Miss Brand?' I asked.    'Yes,' she said, 'but I can't get any one to play with me here of an  evening, the men are generally playing cards or reading.' Then she said,  'It's very dull these long winter evenings when you've got nothing to  do. Young Mr Black used to play draughts, but he's away.'    I saw Jack winking at me urgently.    'I'll play a game with you, if you like,' I said, 'but I ain't much of a  player.'    'Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson! When shall you have an evening to spare?'    We fixed it for that same evening. We got chummy over the draughts. I  had a suspicion even then that it was a put-up job to keep me away from  the pub.    Perhaps she found a way of giving a hint to old Black without committing  herself. Women have ways--or perhaps Jack did it. Anyway, next day the  Boss came round and said to me--    'Look here, Joe, you've got no occasion to stay at the pub. Bring along  your blankets and camp in one of the spare rooms of the old house. You  can have your tucker here.'    He was a good sort, was Black the squatter: a squatter of the old  school, who'd shared the early hardships with his men, and couldn't see  why he should not shake hands and have a smoke and a yarn over old times  with any of his old station hands that happened to come along. But he'd  married an Englishwoman after the hardships were over, and she'd never  got any Australian notions.    Next day I found one of the skillion rooms scrubbed out and a bed fixed  up for me. I'm not sure to this day who did it, but I supposed that  good-natured old Black had given one of the women a hint. After tea  I had a yarn with Mary, sitting on a log of the wood-heap. I don't  remember exactly how we both came to be there, or who sat down  first. There was about two feet between us. We got very chummy and  confidential. She told me about her childhood and her father.    He'd been an old mate of Black's, a younger son of a well-to-do English  family (with blue blood in it, I believe), and sent out to Australia  with a thousand pounds to make his way, as many younger sons are, with  more or less. They think they're hard done by; they blue their thousand  pounds in Melbourne or Sydney, and they don't make any more nowadays,  for the Roarin' Days have been dead these thirty years. I wish I'd had a  thousand pounds to start on!    Mary's mother was the daughter of a German immigrant, who selected  up there in the old days. She had a will of her own as far as I could  understand, and bossed the home till the day of her death. Mary's  father made money, and lost it, and drank--and died. Mary remembered  him sitting on the verandah one evening with his hand on her head, and  singing a German song (the 'Lorelei', I think it was) softly, as if to  himself. Next day he stayed in bed, and the children were kept out of  the room; and, when he died, the children were adopted round (there was  a little money coming from England).    Mary told me all about her girlhood. She went first to live with a sort  of cousin in town, in a house where they took in cards on a tray, and  then she came to live with Mrs Black, who took a fancy to her at first.  I'd had no boyhood to speak of, so I gave her some of my ideas of what  the world ought to be, and she seemed interested.    Next day there were sheets on my bed, and I felt pretty cocky until  I remembered that I'd told her I had no one to care for me; then I  suspected pity again.    But next evening we remembered that both our fathers and mothers were  dead, and discovered that we had no friends except Jack and old Black,  and things went on very satisfactorily.    And next day there was a little table in my room with a crocheted cover  and a looking-glass.    I noticed the other girls began to act mysterious and giggle when I was  round, but Mary didn't seem aware of it.    We got very chummy. Mary wasn't comfortable at Haviland. Old Black  was very fond of her and always took her part, but she wanted to be  independent. She had a great idea of going to Sydney and getting into  the hospital as a nurse. She had friends in Sydney, but she had no  money. There was a little money coming to her when she was twenty-one--a  few pounds--and she was going to try and get it before that time.    'Look here, Miss Brand,' I said, after we'd watched the moon rise. 'I'll  lend you the money. I've got plenty--more than I know what to do with.'    But I saw I'd hurt her. She sat up very straight for a while, looking  before her; then she said it was time to go in, and said 'Good-night, Mr  Wilson.'    I reckoned I'd done it that time; but Mary told me afterwards that she  was only hurt because it struck her that what she said about money might  have been taken for a hint. She didn't understand me yet, and I didn't  know human nature. I didn't say anything to Jack--in fact about this  time I left off telling him about things. He didn't seem hurt; he worked  hard and seemed happy.    I really meant what I said to Mary about the money. It was pure good  nature. I'd be a happier man now, I think, and richer man perhaps, if  I'd never grown any more selfish than I was that night on the wood-heap  with Mary. I felt a great sympathy for her--but I got to love her. I  went through all the ups and downs of it. One day I was having tea in  the kitchen, and Mary and another girl, named Sarah, reached me a clean  plate at the same time: I took Sarah's plate because she was first, and  Mary seemed very nasty about it, and that gave me great hopes. But all  next evening she played draughts with a drover that she'd chummed up  with. I pretended to be interested in Sarah's talk, but it didn't seem  to work.    A few days later a Sydney Jackaroo visited the station. He had a good  pea-rifle, and one afternoon he started to teach Mary to shoot at a  target. They seemed to get very chummy. I had a nice time for three or  four days, I can tell you. I was worse than a wall-eyed bullock with  the pleuro. The other chaps had a shot out of the rifle. Mary called 'Mr  Wilson' to have a shot, and I made a worse fool of myself by sulking. If  it hadn't been a blooming Jackaroo I wouldn't have minded so much.    Next evening the Jackaroo and one or two other chaps and the girls went  out 'possum-shooting. Mary went. I could have gone, but I didn't. I  mooched round all the evening like an orphan bandicoot on a burnt ridge,  and then I went up to the pub and filled myself with beer, and damned  the world, and came home and went to bed. I think that evening was  the only time I ever wrote poetry down on a piece of paper. I got so  miserable that I enjoyed it.    I felt better next morning, and reckoned I was cured. I ran against Mary  accidentally and had to say something.    'How did you enjoy yourself yesterday evening, Miss Brand?' I asked.    'Oh, very well, thank you, Mr Wilson,' she said. Then she asked, 'How  did you enjoy yourself, Mr Wilson?'    I puzzled over that afterwards, but couldn't make anything out of it.  Perhaps she only said it for the sake of saying something. But about  this time my handkerchiefs and collars disappeared from the room and  turned up washed and ironed and laid tidily on my table. I used to keep  an eye out, but could never catch anybody near my room. I straightened  up, and kept my room a bit tidy, and when my handkerchief got too dirty,  and I was ashamed of letting it go to the wash, I'd slip down to the  river after dark and wash it out, and dry it next day, and rub it up to  look as if it hadn't been washed, and leave it on my table. I felt  so full of hope and joy that I worked twice as hard as Jack, till one  morning he remarked casually--    'I see you've made a new mash, Joe. I saw the half-caste cook tidying  up your room this morning and"]]]
