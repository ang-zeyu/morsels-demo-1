Each of the entrance doors would  therefore be raised. Let us further suppose that the right door is  defined as the middle one of the group. With the apparatus properly set,  the experimenter next raises door 12, thus admitting the animal to the  response-compartment E. Any one of the nine boxes may now be entered by  it. But if any except number 5, the middle member of the group, be  entered, the entrance door is immediately lowered and both the exit and  entrance doors locked in position so that the animal is forced to remain  in the box for a stated period, say thirty seconds. At the expiration of  this time the entrance door is raised and the animal allowed to retrace  its steps and make another choice. When the middle box is chosen, the  entrance door is lowered and the exit door immediately raised, thus  uncovering the food, which the animal eats. As a rule, by my monkeys and  ape the reward was eaten in the alleyway G instead of in the  multiple-choice box. As soon as the food has been eaten, the exit door  is lowered by the experimenter, and the animal returns by way of G and H  to runway D, where it awaits its next trial.    As rewards, bananas and peanuts were found very satisfactory, and  although occasionally other foods were supplied in small quantities,  they were on the whole less constantly desired than the former.    Four problems which had previously been presented to other organisms  were in precisely the same form presented to the three primates. These  problems may be described, briefly, by definition of the right reaction  mechanism, thus: problem 1, the first mechanism at the subject's left;  problem 2, the second mechanism at the subject's right (that is, from  the end of the series at the subject's right); problem 3, alternately,  the first mechanism at the subject's left and the first at its right;  problem 4, the middle mechanism of the group.    It was my intention to present these four problems, in order, to each of  the three animals, proceeding with them as rapidly as they were solved.  But as it happened, only one of the three subjects got as far as the  fourth problem. When observations had to be discontinued, Sobke was well  along with the last, or fourth problem; Skirrl was at work at the third  problem; and Julius had failed to solve the second problem.    For each of the problems, a series of ten different settings of the  doors was determined upon in advance. These settings differ from those  employed in a similar investigation with the pig only in that the  numbering of the doors is reversed. In the present apparatus, the boxes  as viewed from the front (entrance) are numbered from the left to the  right end, whereas those of the pig apparatus were numbered from the  right end to the left end.    Below are presented for each of the several problems (1) the numbers of  the settings presented in series; (2) the numbers of the doors open; (3)  the number of doors open in each setting and for the series of ten  settings; and (4) the number of the right door.

Volume 12, No. 332, (#4)"],[1,"engraved on tombs, in honour or memory of the deceased,  and generally containing some eloge of his virtues or good qualities.    Among the Lacedaemonians, epitaphs were only allowed to men who died  bravely in battle; and to women, who were remarkable for their chastity.  The Romans often erected monuments to illustrious persons whilst living,  which were preserved with great veneration after their decease. In this  country, according to Sir Henry Chauncy, \"Any person may erect a tomb,  sepulchre, or monument for the deceased in any church, chancel, chapel, or  churchyard, so that it is not to the hindrance of the celebration of  divine service;  that the defacing of them is punishable at common law,  the party that built it being entitled to the action during his life, and  the heir of the deceased after his death.\"    Boxhornius has made a well chosen collection of Latin epitaphs, and F.  Labbe has also made a similar one in the French language, entitled,  \"_Tresor des Epitaphes_.\" In our own language the collection of Toldewy is  the best; there are also several to be found among the writings of Camden  and Weaver, and in most of the county histories.    In epitaphs, the deceased person is sometimes introduced by way of  prosopopaeia, speaking to the living, of which the following is an  instance, wherein the defunct wife thus addresses her surviving husband:--      \"Immatura peri; sed tu, felicior, annos    Vive tuos, conjux optime, vive meos.\"    The following epitaphs, out of several others, are worth preserving. That  of Alexander:--      \"Sufficit huic tumulus, cui non sufficeret orbis.\"    That of Tasso:--      \"Les os du Tasse.\"    Similar to which is that of Dryden:--      \"Dryden.\"    The following is that of General Foy, in Pere la Chaise:--        \"Honneur au GENERAL FOY.      Il se repose de ses travaux,      Et ses oeuvres le suivent.    Hier quand de ses jours la source fut tarie,    La France, en le voyant sur sa couche entendu,    Implorait un accent de cette voix cherie.    Helas! au cri plaintif jete par la nature,    C'est la premiere fois qu'il ne pas repondu\"    The following is said to have been written by \"rare Ben Jonson,\" and has  been much admired:--      \"Underneath this stone doth lie    As much virtue as could die;    Which, when alive, did vigour give    To as much beauty as could live.\"    To these could be added several others, but at present we shall content  ourselves with quoting the two following, as specimens of the satirical  or ludicrous:--      _Prior, on himself, ridiculing the folly of    those who value themselves on their    pedigree_.      \"Nobles and heralds, by your leave,       Here lie the bones of Matthew Prior,     The son of Adam and Eve,       Let Bourbon or Nassau go higher.\"             *       *       *       *       *      \"Here, fast asleep, full six feet deep,       And seventy summers ripe,     George Thomas lies in hopes to rise,       And smoke another pipe.\"    B. T. S.           *       *       *       *       *    The following inscription, in a churchyard in Germany, long puzzled alike  the learned and the unlearned:--         O   quid  tua  te       be  bis  bia  abit         ra   ra   ra              es           et     in        ram  ram   ram            i   i   Mox eris quod ego nunc.    By accident the meaning was discovered, and the solution is equally  remarkable for its ingenuity and for the morality it inculcates:--\"O  superbe quid superbis? tua superbia te superabit. Terra es, et in terram  ibis. Mox eris quod ego nunc.\"--\"O vain man! why shouldst thou be proud?  thy pride will be thy ruin. Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.  Soon shalt thou be what I am now.\"    W. G. C.           *       *       *       *       *        THE COSMOPOLITE.    WET WEATHER.    (_For the Mirror_.)      \"John's temper depended very much upon the air; his spirits rose and fell  with the weather-glass.\"--ARBUTHNOT.    No one can deny that the above is a _floating_ topic; and we challenge all  the philosophy of ancients or moderns to prove it is not. After the  memorable July 15, (St. Swithin,) people talk of the result with as much  certainty as a merchant calculates on _trade winds_; and in like manner,  hackney-coachmen and umbrella-makers have their _trade rains_. Indeed,  there are, as Shakespeare's contented Duke says, \"books in the running  brooks, and good in every thing;\"[1] and so far from neglecting to turn  the ill-wind to our account, we are disposed to venture a few seasonable  truisms for the gratification of our readers, although a wag may say our  subject is a dry one.        [1] Only the other evening we heard two sons of the whip on a      hackney-coach stand thus invoke the showery deity: \"God send us a      good heavy shower;\" then the fellows looked upwards, chuckled, and      rubbed their hands.    In England, the weather is public news. Zimmerman, however, thinks it is  not a safe topic of discourse. \"Your company,\" says he, \"may be _hippish_.\"  Shenstone, too, says a fine day is the only enjoyment which one man does  not envy another. All this is whimsical enough; but doubtless we are more  operated on by _the weather_ than by any thing else. Perhaps this is  because we are islanders; for talk to an \"intellectual\" man about the  climate, and out comes something about our \"insular situation, aqueous  vapours, condensation,\" &c. Then take up a newspaper on any day of a wet  summer, and you see a long string of paragraphs, with erudite authorities,  about \"the weather,\" average annual depth of rain, &c.; and a score of  lies about tremendous rains, whose only authority, like that of most  miracles, is in their antiquity or repetition. In short, _water_ is one of  the most popular subjects in this age of inquiry. What were the first  treatises of the _Useful Knowledge_ Society? _Hydrostatics_ and  _Hydraulics_. What is the attraction at Sadler's Wells, Bath, and  Cheltenham, but water? the Brighton people, too, not content with the sea,  have even found it necessary to superadd to their fashionable follies,  artificial mineral waters, with whose fount the grossest duchess may in a  few days recover from the repletion of a whole season; and the minister,  after the jading of a session, soon resume his wonted complacency and good  humour.[2] Our aquatic taste is even carried into all our public  amusements; would the festivities in celebration of the late peace have  been complete without the sham fight on the Serpentine? To insure the run  of a melo-drama, the New River is called in to flow over deal boards, and  form a cataract; and the Vauxhall proprietors, with the aid of a  _hydropyric_ exhibition, contrive to represent a naval battle. This  introduction during the past season was, however, as perfectly  _gratuitous_ as that of the _rain_ was uncalled for. Had they contented  themselves with the latter, the scene would have been more true to nature.        [2] Even the greatest hero of the age, who has won all his glory _by      land_, has lately been drinking the Cheltenham _waters_. The proprietor      of the well at which he drank, jocosely observed that his was \"the best      _well-in-town_.\"    We carry this taste into our money-getting speculations, those freaks of  the funds that leave many a man with one unfunded coat. The Thames tunnel  is too amphibious an affair to be included in the number; but the ship  canal project, the bridge-building mania, and the _penchant_ for working  mines by steam, evidently belong to them. The fashion even extends to  royalty, since our good King builds a fishing-temple, and dines on the  Virginia Water; and the Duke of Clarence, as Lord High Admiral, gives a  _dejeune a la fourchette_ between Waterloo and Westminster bridges.    Whoever takes the trouble to read a paper in a late _Edinburgh Review_ on  the _Nervous System_, will doubtless find that much of our predilection  for hanging and drowning is to be attributed to this \"insular situation.\"  Every man and woman of us is indeed a self _pluviometer_, or rain-gauge;  or, in plain terms, our nerves are like so many musical strings, affected  by every change of the atmosphere, which, if screwed up too tight, are apt  to snap off, and become useless; or, if you please, we are like so many  barometers, and our animal spirits like their quicksilver; so \"servile\"  are we to all the \"skyey influences.\" Take, for example, the same man at  three different periods of the year: on a fine morning in January, his  nerves are braced to their best pitch, and, in his own words, he is fit  for any thing; see him panting for cooling streams in a burning July day,  when though an Englishman, he is \"too hot to eat;\" see him on a wet, muggy  ninth of November, when the finery of the city coach and the new liveries  appear tarnished, and common councilmen tramp through the mud and rain in  their robes of little authority--even with the glorious prospect of the  Guildhall tables, the glitter of gas and civic beauty, and the six pounds  of turtle, and iron knives and forks before him--still he is a miserable  creature, he drinks to desperation, and is carried home at least three  hours sooner than he would be on a fine frosty night. Then, instead of  fifteen pounds to the square inch, atmospheric pressure is increased to  five-and-forty, not calculating the _simoom_ of the following morning,  when he is as dry as the desert of Sahara, and eyes the pumps and  soda-water fountains with as much _gout_ as the Israelites did the water  from Mount Horeb.    Man, however, is the most helpless of all creatures in water, and with the  exception of a few proscribed pickpockets and swindlers, he is almost as  helpless on land. This infirmity, or difficulty of keeping above water,  accounts for the crammed state of our prisons, fond as we are of the  element.
