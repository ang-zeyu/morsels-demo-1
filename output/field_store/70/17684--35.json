The American Minister, Dr. Reinsch, was  not enthusiastic about our going south regardless of conditions, but  nevertheless he set about helping us to obtain the necessary visé for our  passports.    We wished first to go to Foochow, in Fukien Province, where we were to hunt  tiger until Mr. Heller joined us in July for the expedition into Yün-nan.  Fukien was still loyal to Yuan, but the strong Japanese influence in this  province, which is directly opposite the island of Formosa, was causing  considerable uneasiness in Peking.    We were armed with telegrams from Mr. C.R. Kellogg, of the Anglo-Chinese  College, with whom we were to stay while in Foochow, assuring us that all  was quiet in the province, and through the influence of Dr. Reinsch, the  Chinese Foreign Office viséd our passports. The huge red stamp which was  affixed to them was an amusing example of Chinese \"face saving.\" First came  the seal of Yuan's impotent dynasty of Hung Hsien, signifying \"Brilliant  Prosperity,\" and directly upon it was placed the stamp of the Chinese  Republic. One was almost as legible as the other and thus the Foreign  Office saved its face in whichever direction the shifting cards of  political destiny should fall.    At a luncheon given by Dr. Reinsch at the Embassy in Peking, we met Admiral  von Hintze, the German Minister, who had recently completed an adventurous  trip from Germany to China. He was Minister to Mexico at the beginning of  the war but had returned to Berlin incognito through England to ask the  Kaiser for active sea service. The Emperor was greatly elated over von  Hintze's performance and offered him the appointment of Minister to China  if he could reach Peking in the same way that he had traveled to Berlin.  Von Hintze therefore shipped as supercargo on a Scandinavian tramp steamer  and arrived safely at Shanghai, where he assumed all the pomp of a foreign  diplomat and proceeded to the capital.    The Americans were in a rather difficult position at this time because of  the international complications, and social intercourse was extremely  limited. Dinner guests had to be chosen with the greatest care and one was  very likely to meet exactly the same people wherever one went.    Peking is a place never to be forgotten by one who has shared its social  life. In the midst of one of the most picturesque, most historical, and  most romantic cities of the world there is a cosmopolitan community that  enjoys itself to the utmost. Its talk is all of horses, polo, racing,  shooting, dinners, and dances, with the interesting background of Chinese  politics, in which things are never dull. There is always a rebellion of  some kind to furnish delightful thrills, and one never can tell when a new  political bomb will be projected from the mysterious gates of the Forbidden  City.    We spent a week in Peking and regretfully left by rail for Shanghai. _En  route_ we passed through Tsinan-fu where the previous night serious  fighting had occurred in which Japanese soldiers had joined with the rebels  against Yuan's troops. On every side there was evidence of Japan's efforts  against him. In the foreign quarter of Shanghai just behind the residence  of Mr. Sammons, the American Consul-General, one of Yuan's leading officers  had been openly murdered, and Japanese were directly concerned in the plot.  We were told that it was very difficult at that time to lease houses in the  foreign concession because wealthy Chinese who feared the wrath of one  party or the other were eager to pay almost any rent to obtain the  protection of that quarter of the city.    A short time later it became known to a few that Yuan was seriously ill. He  was suffering from Bright's disease with its consequent weakness, loss of  mental alertness, and lack of concentration. French doctors were called in,  but Yuan's wives insisted upon treating him with concoctions of their own,  and on June 6, shortly after three o'clock in the morning, he died.    Even on his death-bed Yuan endeavored to save his face before the country,  and his last words were a reiteration of what he knew no one believed. The  story of his death is told in the _China Press_ of June 7, 1916:        According to news from the President's palace the condition of Yuan      became critical at three o'clock in the morning. Yuan asked for his old      confidential friend, Hsu Shih-chang, who came immediately. On the      arrival of Hsu, Yuan was extremely weak, but entirely conscious.        With tears in his eyes, Yuan assured his old friend that he had never      had any personal ambition for an emperor's crown; he had been deceived      by his _entourage_ over the true state of public opinion and thus had      sincerely believed the people wished for the restoration of the      monarchy. The desire of the South for his resignation he had not wished      to follow for fear that general anarchy would break out all over China.      Now that he felt death approaching he asked Hsu to make his last words      known to the public.        In the temporary residence of President Li Yuan-hung, situated in the      Yung-chan-hu-tung (East City) and formerly owned by Yang Tu, the      prominent monarchist, the formal transfer of the power to Li-Yuan-hung      took place this morning at ten o'clock. Yuan Chi-jui, Secretary of      State and Premier, as well as all the members of the cabinet, Prince Pu      Lun as chairman of the State Council, and other high officials were      present.        The officials, wearing ceremonial dress, were received by Li-Yuan-hung      in the main hall and made three bows to the new president, which were      returned by the latter. The same ceremony will take place at two      o'clock, when all the high military officials will assemble at the      President's residence.        The Cabinet, in a circular telegram has informed all the provinces that      Vice-President Li-Yuan-hung, in accordance with the constitution, has      become president of the Chinese Republic (Chung-hua-min-kuo) from the      seventh instance.    So ended Yuan Shi-kai's great plot to make himself an emperor over four  hundred millions of people, a plot which could only have been carried out  in China. He failed, and the once valiant warrior died in the humiliation  of defeat, leaving thirty-two wives, forty children and his country in  political chaos.          CHAPTER III      UP THE MIN RIVER    _Y.B.A._    Three days after leaving Shanghai we arrived at Pagoda Anchorage at the  mouth of the Min River, twelve miles from Foochow.    We boarded a launch which threaded its way through a fleet of picturesque  fishing vessels, each one of which had a round black and white eye painted  on its crescent-shaped bow. When asked the reason for this decoration a  Chinese on the launch looked at us rather pityingly for a moment and then  said: \"No have eye. No can see.\" How simple and how entirely satisfactory!    The instant the launch touched the shore dozens of coolies swarmed like  flies over it, fighting madly for our luggage. One seized a trunk, the  other end of which had been appropriated by another man and, in the  argument which ensued, each endeavored to deafen the other by his screams.  The habit of yelling to enforce command is inherent with the Chinese and  appears to be ineradicable. To expostulate in an ordinary tone of voice,  pausing to listen to his opponent's reply, seems a psychological  impossibility.    There had been a mistake about the date of our arrival at Foochow, and we  were two days earlier than we had been expected, so that Mr. C.R. Kellogg,  of the Anglo-Chinese College, with whom we were to stay, was not on the  jetty to meet us. We were at a loss to know where to turn amidst the chaos  and confusion until a customs officer took us in charge and, judiciously  selecting a competent looking woman from among the screaming multitude,  told her to get two sedan chairs and coolies to carry our luggage. She  disappeared and ten minutes later the chairs arrived. Dashing about among  the crowd in front of us, she chose the baggage for such men as met with  her approval and after the usual amount of argument the loads were taken.    We mounted our chairs and started off with apparently all Foochow following  us. As far as we could see down the narrow street were the heads and  shoulders of our porters. We felt as if we were heading an invading army  as, with our thirty-three coolies and sixteen hundred pounds of luggage, we  descended upon the homes of people whom we did not know and who were not  expecting us. But our sudden arrival did not disturb the Kelloggs and our  welcome was typical of the warm hospitality one always finds in the Far  East.    No matter how long one has lived in China one remains in a condition of  mental suspense unable to decide which is the filthiest city of the  Republic. The residents of Foochow boast that for offensiveness to the  senses no town can compare with theirs, and although Amoy and several other  places dispute this questionable title, we were inclined to grant it  unreservedly to Foochow. It is like a medieval city with its narrow,  ill-paved streets wandering aimlessly in a hopeless maze. They are usually  roofed over so that by no accident can a ray of purifying sun penetrate  their dark corners. With no ventilation whatsoever the oppressive air reeks  with the odors that rise from the streets and the steaming houses.    In Foochow, as in other cities of China, the narrow alleys are literally  choked with every form of industrial obstruction. Countless workmen plant  themselves in the tiny passageways with the pigs, children, and dogs, and  women bring their quilts to spread upon the stones. There is a common  saying that the Chinese do little which is not at some time done on the  street.    The foreign residents, including consuls of all nationalities,  missionaries, and merchants,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#4)"],[1,"stay up most of the  night. Sumptimes they would stay three or four days. And once in a while  after one of these big doings Mistuh Smith would look worried, and we  wouldn't get no meat and vary little of anything else for a long time.  He would be crabby and beat us for any little thing. He used to tell my  papa that he wouldn't have a d--- cent until he made some crops.\"    A few years before he left to enter the war the slave owner came into  possession of a store near his plantation. This store was in Greensboro.  Either because the business paid or because of another of his economic  'bad spells', ownership of his plantation passed to a man named Kimball  and most of the slaves, with the exception of Bill Austin and one or two  women--either transferred with the plantation or sold. Bill was kept to  do errands and general work around the store.    Bill learned much about the operation of the store, with the result that  when Mr. Smith left with the Southern Army he left his wife and Bill to  continue its operation. By this time there used to be frequent stories  whispered among the slaves in the neighborhood--and who came with their  masters into the country store--of how this or that slave ran away, and  with the white man-power of the section engaged in war, remained at  large for long periods or escaped altogether.    These stories always interested Austin, with the result that one morning  he was absent when Mrs. Smith opened the store. He remained away 'eight  or nine days, I guess', before a friend of the Smiths found him near  Macon and threatened that he would 'half kill him' if he didn't return  immediately.    Either the threat--or the fact that in Macon there were no readily  available foodstuffs to be eaten all day as in the store--caused Austin  to return. He was roundly berated by his mistress, but finally forgiven  by the worried woman who needed his help around the store more than she  needed the contrite promises and effusive declarations that he would  'behave alright for the rest of his life.'    And he did behave; for several whole months. But by this tine he was 'a  great big boy', and he had caught sight of a young woman who took his  fancy on his trip to Macon. She was free herself; her father had bought  her freedom with that of her mother a few years before, and did odd jobs  for the white people in the city for a livelihood. Bill had thoughts of  going back to Macon, marrying her, and bringing her back 'to work for  Missus with me.' He asked permission to go, and was refused on the  grounds that his help was too badly needed at the store. Shortly  afterward he had again disappeared.    'Missus', however, knew too much of his plans by this time, and it was  no difficult task to have him apprehended in Macon. Bill may not have  had such great objections to the apprehension, either, he says, because  by this time he had learned that the young woman in Macon had no  slightest intention to give up her freedom to join him at Greensboro.    A relative of Mrs. Smith gave Austin a sound beating on his return; for  a time it had the desired effect, and he stayed at the store and gave no  further trouble. Mrs. Smith, however, thought of a surer plan of keeping  him in Greensboro; she called him and told him he might have his  freedom. Bill never attempted to again leave the place--although he did  not receive a cent for his work--until his master had died, the store  passed into the hands of one of Mr. Smith's sons, and the emancipation  of all the slaves was a matter of eight or ten years' history!    When he finally left Greene and Hancock Counties--about fifty-five years  ago, Austin settled in Jackson County. He married and began the raising  of a family. At present he has nineteen living children, more  grandchildren than he can accurately tell, and is living with his third  wife, a woman in her thirties.      BIBLIOGRAPHY    1.

Interview with subject, near Greenwood, Florida, (Rural Route 2,  Sneads)          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Pearl Randolph, Field Worker  John A. Simms, Editor  Jacksonville, Florida  August 18, 1936    FRANK BERRY      Frank Berry, living at 1614 west Twenty-Second street, Jacksonville,  Florida, claims to be a grandson of Osceola, last fighting chief of the  Seminole tribe. Born in 1858 of a mother who was part of the human  chattel belonging to one of the Hearnses of Alachua County in Florida,  he served variously during his life as a State and Federal Government  contractor, United States Marshal (1881), Registration Inspector (1879).    Being only eight years of age when the Emancipation Proclamation was  issued, he remembers little of his life as a slave. The master was kind  in an impersonal way but made no provision for his freedmen as did many  other Southerners--usually in the form of land grants--although he gave  them their freedom as soon as the proclamation was issued. Berry learned  from his elders that their master was a noted duelist and owned several  fine pistols some of which have very bloody histories.    It was during the hectic days that followed the Civil War that Berry  served in the afore-mentioned offices. He held his marshalship under a  Judge King of Jacksonville, Florida. As State and Federal Government  Contractor he built many public structures, a few of which are still in  use, among them the jetties at Mayport, Florida which he helped to build  and a jail at High Springs, Florida.    It was during the war between the Indians and settlers that Berry's  grandmother, serving as a nurse at Tampa Bay was captured by the Indians  and carried away to become the squaw of their chief; she was later  re-captured by her owners. This was a common procedure, according to  Berry's statements. Indians often captured slaves, particularly the  women, or aided in their escape and almost always intermarried with  them. The red men were credited with inciting many uprisings and  wholesale escapes among the slaves.    Country frolics (dances) were quite often attended by Indians, whose  main reason for going was to obtain whiskey, for which they had a very  strong fondness. Berry describes an intoxicated Indian as a \"tornado mad  man\" and recalls a hair raising incident that ended in tragedy for the  offender.    A group of Indians were attending one of these frolics at Fort Myers  and everything went well until one of the number became intoxicated,  terrorizing the Negroes with bullying, and fighting anyone with whom he  could \"pick\" a quarrel. \"Big Charlie\" an uncle of the narrator was  present and when the red man challenged him to a fight made a quick end  of him by breaking his neck at one blow.    For two years he was hounded by revengeful Indians, who had an uncanny  way of ferreting out his whereabouts no matter where he went. Often he  sighted them while working in the fields and would be forced to flee to  some other place. This continued with many hairbreadth escapes, until he  was forced to move several states away.    Berry recalls the old days of black aristocracy when Negroes held high  political offices in the state of Florida, when Negro tradesmen and  professionals competed successfully and unmolested with the whites. Many  fortunes were made by men who are now little more than beggars. To this  group belongs the man who in spite of reduced circumstances manages  still to make one think of top hats and state affairs. Although small of  stature and almost disabled by rheumatism, he has the fiery dignity and  straight back that we associate with men who have ruled others. At the  same time he might also be characterized as a sweet old person, with all  the tender reminiscences of the old days and the and childish  prejudices against all things new. As might be expected, he lives in the  past and always is delighted whenever he is asked to tell about the only  life that he has ever really lived. Together with his aged wife he lives  with his children and is known to local relief agencies who supplement  the very small income he now derives from what is left of what was at  one time a considerable fortune.

She is married, and has several  children. For her age she is exceptionally active, being able to wash  and do her house work. With optimism she looks forward to many more  years of life. Her health is excellent.    Having spent thirty-two years of her life as a slave she relates vividly  some of her experiences.    Her master Lancaster Jamison was a very kind man and never mistreated  his slaves. He was a man of mediocre means, and instead of having a  large plantation as was usual in those days, he ran a boarding house,  the revenue therefrom furnishing him substance for a livelihood. He had  a small farm from which fresh produce was obtained to supply the needs  of his lodgers. Mary's family were his only slaves. The family consisted  of her mother, father, brother and a sister. The children called the old  master \"Fa\" and their father \"Pappy.\" The master never resented this  appellation, and took it in good humor. Many travelers stopped at his  boarding house; Mary's mother did the cooking, her father \"tended\" the  farm, and Mary, her brother and sister, did chores about the place.  There was a large one-room house built in the yard in which the family  lived. Her father had a separate garden in which he raised his produce,  also a smokehouse where the family meats were kept. Meats were smoked  in order to preserve them.    During the day Mary's father was"]]]
