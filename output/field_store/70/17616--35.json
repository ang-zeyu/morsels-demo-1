I pray you to let me  rest here for a short time.\"    \"I cannot let you stay here, because our king is not willing to help  any one who does not belong to his kingdom. If he did so, his kingdom  would be lost. But what is your name? Do you know how to sing?\" said  the old man.    \"My name is Jackyo, and I know a little bit about singing,\" replied  Jackyo.    \"Well,\" said the old man, \"if you know any song, sing for me.\" Now  Jackyo knew but one song, and that was about the names of the days of  the week except Sunday. He did not like to sing it, but the old man  urged him, saying: \"If you do not sing, I will cut your head off.\" So  Jackyo began to sing.    It happened that the king [5] of the evil spirits, whose name was  Mensaya, heard Jackyo's song and was very much interested in it. He  called a servant, named Macquil, and said: \"Macquil, go downstairs and  see who is singing down there, and when you find him, bring him to me.\"    Jackyo went before the king, bowed to the floor, touching the carpet  with his forehead, and stood humbly before the king.    \"Let me hear your song,\" said the king. So Jackyo, with great respect,  sang the only song he knew. Here it is:        Mon-day, Tues-day, Wednesday, Thurs-day, Fri-day, Sat-ur-day.    While he was singing, all the evil spirits in the cave gathered around  him to hear his song, and Mensaya asked him to sing it over and over  again. They were all so pleased with it that Mensaya ordered Macquil  to give Jackyo a large quantity of gold and silver as a reward for  his beautiful song.    When the morning came Jackyo returned home, full of joy, and became  known as the richest man in the village.      CHAPTER 2    Truth and Falsehood.    One day Truth started for the city to find some work. On his  way he overtook Falsehood, who was going to the city for the same  purpose. Falsehood asked permission to ride on the horse with Truth,  and his request was granted.    On the way they questioned each other as to the sort of work they  wanted. Truth stated that he intended to be a secretary, so that he  might always be clean and white. Falsehood declared that he would be  a cook, because then he would always have plenty of fine things to eat.    As they were riding along, they met a man carrying a corpse to the  cemetery. He had no one to help him, and Truth, in his great pity for  the man, jumped off his horse and helped him. After the corpse was  buried, Truth asked: \"Did you pray for the repose of the soul of the  dead?\" \"No,\" was the reply, \"I do not know how to pray, and I have  no money to pay the priest for candles.\" Then Truth gave the man all  the money he had, that he might have prayers said for the dead man,  and went back to his companion.    When dinner time came, Falsehood was very angry at finding out that  Truth had given all his money away, but finally proposed that they  should go to the river and catch some fish for dinner. When they  arrived at the river, they found some fish which had been caught  in a shallow pool near the bank, and caught all they wanted. But  Truth was very sorry for the fish, and threw his half back into the  river. Falsehood murmured at him and said: \"It would have been better  for you to give them to me. If I had known that you would throw them  into the river, I would not have given you any of them.\" Then they  rode on. As they were going through a thick wood in the heart of the  mountain they heard a noise as of crying, far away. Truth went forward  to find what it was, but Falsehood, trembling with fear, hid himself  close behind his comrade. At last they saw seven little eagles in a  nest high in a tree. They were crying with hunger, and their mother was  nowhere to be seen. Truth was sorry for them, and killed his horse,  giving some of the meat to the young eagles, and spreading the rest  on the ground beneath the tree, so that the mother-bird might find it.    Falsehood hated his comrade for having killed the horse, because now  they were obliged to travel on foot. They went down the mountain,  and entering the city, presented themselves before the king, desiring  to be taken into his service, the one as secretary and the other as  cook. The king granted both requests.    When Falsehood saw that his former companion sat at the table with  the king and was always clean and dressed in good clothes, while he  himself was dirty and had to eat in the kitchen, he was very angry  and determined to do something to ruin the one whom now he hated  so bitterly.    One day the king and queen went to sail on the sea. As they were far  from land, the queen dropped her ring overboard. When Falsehood heard  of the accident, he went to the king and said: \"My Lord, the King,  my friend--your secretary--has told me that he was endowed with magic  powers and is able to find the queen's ring. He says if he does not  find it he is willing for you to hang him.\"    The king immediately sent for Truth, and said to him: \"Find the queen's  ring without delay, or I will have you hanged early to-morrow morning.\"    Truth went down to the shore, but seeing how impossible it would be  to find the ring, began to weep. A fish came near, and floating on  top of the water, asked, \"Why are you weeping?\"    \"I weep,\" Truth replied, \"because the king will hang me early to-morrow  morning unless I find the queen's ring, which has fallen into the sea.\"    The fish swam out and got the ring and gave it to Truth. Then he said:  \"I am one of the fishes which you found on the bank of the river and  threw back into the water. As you helped me when I was in trouble,  I am very glad that I have been able to help you now.\"    On another day, Falsehood went to the king and said: \"My Lord King,  do you remember what I told you the other day?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the king, \"and I believe you told me the truth, as  the ring has been found.\"    \"Well,\" replied Falsehood, \"my friend told me last night that he is  a great magician and that he is willing for you to hang him in the  sight of all the people, since it will not hurt him.\"    The king sent for Truth and told him: \"I know what you have said to  your friend. To-morrow I will have you hanged in the sight of all  the people, and we will see whether you are the great magician you  claim to be.\"    That night Truth could not sleep. About midnight, as he was in great  distress, a spirit suddenly appeared to him and asked what was the  cause of his grief. Truth related his trouble, and the spirit said:  \"Do not weep. To-morrow morning I will take your form and wear your  clothes, and let them hang me.\"    The next morning, just at dawn, the spirit put on Truth's clothes and  went out to be hanged. Many people came to see the hanging, and after  it was over, returned to their homes. What was the astonishment of  the king and those with him when, upon their return to the palace,  they found Truth there before them, alive and well!    That night the spirit appeared to Truth and said: \"I am the spirit  of the dead man for whom you gave your money that prayers might be  said for the repose of his soul.\" Then it disappeared.    On another day Falsehood appeared before the king and said: \"My Lord  the King, my friend the secretary told me last night that if you would  let him marry your daughter, in one night his wife should bring forth  three children.\" The king sent for Truth and said: \"I will give you  my daughter to be your wife and if to-night she does not bear three  children, I will have you buried alive to-morrow morning.\"    So they were married. But at midnight, as Truth lay awake thinking  of the fate that was in store for him in the morning, an eagle  flew through the window, and asked the cause of his sorrow. Truth  related his tale, and the eagle said: \"Do not worry; I will take  care of that.\" Then he flew away, but just before the break of day  three eagles came, each bearing a new-born babe. Truth awakened the  princess and said to her: \"My dear wife, these are our children. We  must love them and take good care of them.\"    Then the king, who had been awakened by the noise of children crying,  sent to ask what it was all about. When he heard the news he came  into the tower where the princess was, and when he saw the children  he was overcome with joy; for he had no sons, and greatly desired to  have an heir to his throne. So the king made a great feast and gave  over his crown and sceptre to his son-in-law, to be king in his stead.    Thus we see that those who help others when in trouble shall themselves  be aided when they are in difficulty.      CHAPTER 3    Camanla and Parotpot.    Camanla was a very poor but very busy man, and always praising his  own work. When he talked with other people he ended every third or  fourth word with \"la,\" which was the last syllable of his name and  is a word of praise.    One day he made a boat, and when it was finished he began to talk  to it. These were his words: \"My boat, la, you may go, la, to find  a pretty lady, la, for my wife, la, to make me happy, la.\" Then his  boat started to sail without anybody to manage it. When she reached a  large town she stopped in the river, near where the pretty daughters  of some rich men of the town were taking a walk. They were accustomed  to take any boat they might find and use it when they wished to cross  the river, returning in the same way.    As Camanla's boat was there and looked very fine, the young ladies  decided to cross the river in it. The youngest was the first to jump  into the boat. When the little boat felt that some one had come on  board, she ran away, carrying the lady.    When Camanla saw his boat coming, he began to praise it, saying:  \"My boat, la, is coming, la, to bring me, la, my pretty lady, to marry  me, la.\" Very soon the boat anchored, and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#4)"],[1,"or one of four brothers born at one  birth; very generally at the cost of their mother's life, who is a virgin,  or at least had never been impregnated by mortal man. The hero is apt to  come into conflict with his brother, or one of his brothers, and the long  and desperate struggle resulting, which often involved the universe in  repeated destructions, constitutes one of the leading topics of the  myth-makers. The duel is not generally--not at all, I believe, when we can  get at the genuine native form of the myth--between a morally good and an  evil spirit, though, undoubtedly, the one is more friendly and favorable  to the welfare of man than the other.    The better of the two, the true hero-god, is in the end triumphant, though  the national temperament represented this variously. At any rate, his  people are not deserted by him, and though absent, and perhaps for a while  driven away by his potent adversary, he is sure to come back some time or  other.    The place of his birth is nearly always located in the East; from that  quarter he first came when he appeared as a man among men; toward that  point he returned when he disappeared; and there he still lives, awaiting  the appointed time for his reappearance.    Whenever the personal appearance of this hero-god is described, it is,  strangely enough, represented to be that of one of the white race, a man  of fair complexion, with long, flowing beard, with abundant hair, and  clothed in ample and loose robes. This extraordinary fact naturally  suggests the gravest suspicion that these stories were made up after the  whites had reached the American shores, and nearly all historians have  summarily rejected their authenticity, on this account. But a most careful  scrutiny of their sources positively refutes this opinion. There is  irrefragable evidence that these myths and this ideal of the hero-god,  were intimately known and widely current in America long before any one of  its millions of inhabitants had ever seen a white man. Nor is there any  difficulty in explaining this, when we divest these figures of the  fanciful garbs in which they have been clothed by the religious  imagination, and recognize what are the phenomena on which they are based,  and the physical processes whose histories they embody. To show this I  will offer, in the most concise terms, my interpretation of their main  details.    The most important of all things to life is _Light_. This the primitive  savage felt, and, personifying it, he made Light his chief god. The  beginning of the day served, by analogy, for the beginning of the world.  Light comes before the sun, brings it forth, creates it, as it were. Hence  the Light-God is not the Sun-God, but his Antecedent and Creator.    The light appears in the East, and thus defines that cardinal point, and  by it the others are located. These points, as indispensable guides to the  wandering hordes, became, from earliest times, personified as important  deities, and were identified with the winds that blew from them, as wind  and rain gods. This explains the four brothers, who were nothing else than  the four cardinal points, and their mother, who dies in producing them, is  the eastern light, which is soon lost in the growing day. The East, as  their leader, was also the supposed ruler of the winds, and thus god of  the air and rain. As more immediately connected with the advent and  departure of light, the East and West are twins, the one of which sends  forth the glorious day-orb, which the other lies in wait to conquer. Yet  the light-god is not slain. The sun shall rise again in undiminished  glory, and he lives, though absent.    By sight and light we see and learn. Nothing, therefore, is more natural  than to attribute to the light-god the early progress in the arts of  domestic and social life. Thus light came to be personified as the  embodiment of culture and knowledge, of wisdom, and of the peace and  prosperity which are necessary for the growth of learning.    The fair complexion of these heroes is nothing but a reference to the  white light of the dawn. Their ample hair and beard are the rays of the  sun that flow from his radiant visage. Their loose and large robes typify  the enfolding of the firmament by the light and the winds.    This interpretation is nowise strained, but is simply that which, in Aryan  mythology, is now universally accepted for similar mythological creations.  Thus, in the Greek Phoebus and Perseus, in the Teutonic Lif, and in the  Norse Baldur, we have also beneficent hero-gods, distinguished by their  fair complexion and ample golden locks. \"Amongst the dark as well as  amongst the fair races, amongst those who are marked by black hair and  dark eyes, they exhibit the same unfailing type of blue-eyed heroes whose  golden locks flow over their shoulders, and whose faces gleam as with the  light of the new risen sun.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Sir George W. Cox, _An Introduction to the Science of  Comparative Mythology and Folk-Lore_, p. 17.]    Everywhere, too, the history of these heroes is that of a struggle against  some potent enemy, some dark demon or dragon, but as often against some  member of their own household, a brother or a father.    The identification of the Light-God with the deity of the winds is also  seen in Aryan mythology. Hermes, to the Greek, was the inventor of the  alphabet, music, the cultivation of the olive, weights and measures, and  such humane arts. He was also the messenger of the gods, in other words,  the breezes, the winds, the air in motion. His name Hermes, Hermeias, is  but a transliteration of the Sanscrit Sarameyas, under which he appears in  the Vedic songs, as the son of Sarama, the Dawn. Even his character as the  master thief and patron saint of the light-fingered gentry, drawn from the  way the winds and breezes penetrate every crack and cranny of the house,  is absolutely repeated in the Mexican hero-god Quetzalcoatl, who was also  the patron of thieves. I might carry the comparison yet further, for as  Sarameyas is derived from the root _sar_, to creep, whence _serpo_,  serpent, the creeper, so the name Quetzalcoatl can be accurately  translated, \"the wonderful serpent.\" In name, history and functions the  parallelism is maintained throughout.    Or we can find another familiar myth, partly Aryan, partly Semitic, where  many of the same outlines present themselves. The Argive Thebans  attributed the founding of their city and state to Cadmus. He collected  their ancestors into a community, gave them laws, invented the alphabet of  sixteen letters, taught them the art of smelting metals, established  oracles, and introduced the Dyonisiac worship, or that of the reproductive  principle. He subsequently left them and lived for a time with other  nations, and at last did not die, but was changed into a dragon and  carried by Zeus to Elysion.    The birthplace of this culture hero was somewhere far to the eastward of  Greece, somewhere in \"the purple land\" (Phoenicia); his mother was \"the  far gleaming one\" (Telephassa); he was one of four children, and his  sister was Europe, the Dawn, who was seized and carried westward by Zeus,  in the shape of a white bull. Cadmus seeks to recover her, and sets out,  following the westward course of the sun. \"There can be no rest until the  lost one is found again. The sun must journey westward until he sees again  the beautiful tints which greeted his eyes in the morning.\"[1] Therefore  Cadmus leaves the purple land to pursue his quest. It is one of toil and  struggle. He has to fight the dragon offspring of Ares and the bands of  armed men who spring from the dragon's teeth which were sown, that is, the  clouds and gloom of the overcast sky. He conquers, and is rewarded, but  does not recover his sister.    [Footnote 1: Sir George W. Cox, _Ibid._, p. 76.]    When we find that the name Cadmus is simply the Semitic word _kedem_, the  east, and notice all this mythical entourage, we see that this legend is  but a lightly veiled account of the local source and progress of the light  of day, and of the advantages men derive from it. Cadmus brings the  letters of the alphabet from the east to Greece, for the same reason that  in ancient Maya myth Itzamna, \"son of the mother of the morning,\" brought  the hieroglyphs of the Maya script also from the east to Yucatan--because  both represent the light by which we see and learn.    Egyptian mythology offers quite as many analogies to support this  interpretation of American myths as do the Aryan god-stories.    The heavenly light impregnates the virgin from whom is born the sun-god,  whose life is a long contest with his twin brother. The latter wins, but  his victory is transient, for the light, though conquered and banished by  the darkness, cannot be slain, and is sure to return with the dawn, to the  great joy of the sons of men. This story the Egyptians delighted to repeat  under numberless disguises. The groundwork and meaning are the same,  whether the actors are Osiris, Isis and Set, Ptah, Hapi and the Virgin  Cow, or the many other actors of this drama. There, too, among a brown  race of men, the light-god was deemed to be not of their own hue, but  \"light colored, white or yellow,\" of comely countenance, bright eyes and  golden hair. Again, he is the one who invented the calendar, taught the  arts, established the rituals, revealed the medical virtues of plants,  recommended peace, and again was identified as one of the brothers of the  cardinal points.[1]    [Footnote 1: See Dr. C.P. Tiele, _History of the Egyptian Religion_, pp.  93, 95, 99, et al.]    The story of the virgin-mother points, in America as it did in the old  world, to the notion of the dawn bringing forth the sun. It was one of the  commonest myths in both continents, and in a period of human thought when  miracles were supposed to be part of the order of things had in it nothing  difficult of"]]]
