Fry the liver  and send it in hot.           *       *       *       *       *    FOR THE SOUP.    At an early hour in the morning, put on eight pounds of coarse beef,  some bacon, onions, sweet herbs, pepper and salt. Make a rich soup,  strain it and thicken with a bit of butter, and brown flour; add to it  the water left from boiling the bottom shell; season it very high with  wine, catsup, spice and cayenne; put in the flesh you reserved, and if  that is not enough, add the nicest parts of a well boiled calf's head;  but do not use the eyes or tongue; let it boil till tender, and serve it  up with fried forcemeat balls in it.    If you have curry powder, (see receipt for it,) it will give a higher  flavour to both soup and turtle, than spice. Should you not want soup,  the remaining flesh may be fried, and served with a rich gravy.           *       *       *       *       *    MOCK TURTLE SOUP OF CALF'S HEAD.    Have a large head cleaned nicely without taking off the skin, divide the  chop from the front of the head, take out the tongue, (which is best  when salted,) put on the head with a gallon of water, the hock of a ham  or a piece of nice pork, four or five onions, thyme, parsley, cloves and  nutmeg, pepper and salt, boil all these together until the flesh on the  head is quite tender, then take it up, cut all into small pieces, take  the eyes out carefully, strain the water in which it was boiled, add  half a pint of wine and a gill of mushroom catsup, let it boil slowly  till reduced to two quarts, thicken it with two spoonsful of browned  flour rubbed into four ounces of butter, put the meat in, and after  stewing it a short time, serve it up. The eyes are a great delicacy.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF.      DIRECTIONS FOR CURING BEEF.    Prepare your brine in the middle of October, after the following manner:  get a thirty gallon cask, take out one head, drive in the bung, and put  some pitch on it, to prevent leaking. See that the cask is quite tight  and clean. Put into it one pound of saltpetre powdered, fifteen quarts  of salt, and fifteen gallons of cold water; stir it frequently, until  dissolved, throw over the cask a thick cloth, to keep out the dust; look  at it often and take off the scum. These proportions have been  accurately ascertained--fifteen gallons of cold water will exactly hold,  in solution, fifteen quarts of good clean Liverpool salt, and one pound  of saltpetre: this brine will be strong enough to bear up an egg: if  more salt be added, it will fall to the bottom without strengthening the  brine, the water being already saturated. This brine will cure all the  beef which a private family can use in the course of the winter, and  requires nothing more to be done to it except occasionally skimming the  dross that rises. It must be kept in a cool, dry place. For salting your  beef, get a molasses hogshead and saw it in two, that the beef may have  space to lie on; bore some holes in the bottom of these tubs, and raise  them on one side about an inch, that the bloody brine may run off.    Be sure that your beef is newly killed--rub each piece very well with  good Liverpool salt--a vast deal depends upon rubbing the salt into  every part--it is unnecessary to put saltpetre on it; sprinkle a good  deal of salt on the bottom of the tub. When the beef is well salted, lay  it in the tub, and be sure you put the fleshy side downward. Put a great  deal of salt on your beef after it is packed in the tub; this protects  it from animals who might eat, if they could smell it, and does not  waste the salt, for the beef can only dissolve a certain portion. You  must let the beef lie in salt ten days, then take it out, brush off the  salt, and wipe it with a damp cloth; put it in the brine with a bit of  board and weight to keep it under. In about ten days it will look red  and be fit for the table, but it will be red much sooner when the brine  becomes older. The best time to begin to salt beef is the latter end of  October, if the weather be cool, and from that time have it in  succession. When your beef is taken out of the tub, stir the salt about  to dry, that it may be ready for the next pieces. Tongues are cured in  the same manner.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRY BEEF FOR SUMMER USE.    The best pieces for this purpose are the thin briskets, or that part of  the plate which is farthest from the shoulder of the animal, the round  and rib pieces which are commonly used for roasting. These should not be  cut with long ribs and the back-bones must be sawed off as close as  possible, that the piece may lay flat in the dish. About the middle of  February, select your beef from an animal well fatted with corn, and  which, when killed, will weigh one hundred and fifty per quarter--larger  oxen are always coarse. Salt the pieces as directed, let them lie one  fortnight, then put them in brine, where they must remain three weeks:  take them out at the end of the time, wipe them quite dry, rub them over  with bran, and hang them in a cool, dry, and, if possible, dark place,  that the flies may not get to them: they must be suspended, and not  allowed to touch any thing. It will be necessary, in the course of the  summer, to look them over occasionally, and after a long wet season, to  lay them in the sun a few hours. Your tongues may be dried in the same  manner: make a little hole in the root, run a twine through it, and  suspend it. These dried meats must be put in a good quantity of water,  to soak, the night before they are to be used. In boiling it is  absolutely necessary to have a large quantity of water to put the beef  in while the water is cold, to boil steadily, skimming the pot, until  the bones are ready to fall out; and, if a tongue, till the skin peels  off with perfect ease: the skin must also be taken from the beef. The  housekeeper who will buy good ox beef, and follow these directions  exactly, may be assured of always having delicious beef on her table.  Ancient prejudice has established a notion, that meat killed in the  decrease of the moon, will draw up when cooked. The true cause of this  shrinking, may be found in the old age of the animal, or in its diseased  state, at the time of killing. The best age is from three to five years.    Few persons are aware of the injury they sustain, by eating the flesh of  diseased animals. None but the Jewish butchers, who are paid exclusively  for it, attend to this important circumstance. The best rule for judging  that I have been able to discover, is the colour of the fat. When the  fat of beef is a high shade of yellow, I reject it. If the fat of veal,  mutton, lamb or pork, have the slightest tinge of yellow, I avoid it as  diseased. The same rule holds good when applied to poultry.           *       *       *       *       *    TO CORN BEEF IN HOT WEATHER.    Take a piece of thin brisket or plate, cut out the ribs nicely, rub it  on both sides well with two large spoonsful of pounded saltpetre; pour  on it a gill of molasses and a quart of salt; rub them both in; put it  in a vessel just large enough to hold it, but not tight, for the bloody  brine must run off as it makes, or the meat will spoil. Let it be well  covered, top, bottom and sides, with the molasses and salt. In four days  you may boil it, tied up in a cloth with the salt, &c. about it: when  done, take the skin off nicely, and serve it up. If you have an  ice-house or refrigerator, it will be best to keep it there. A fillet or  breast of veal, and a leg or rack of mutton, are excellent done in the  same way.           *       *       *       *       *    IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ON ROASTING, BOILING, FRYING, &c.    In roasting butchers' meat, be careful not to run the spit through the  nice parts: let the piece lie in water one hour, then wash it out, wipe  it perfectly dry, and put it on the spit. Set it before a clear, steady  fire: sprinkle some salt on it, and when it becomes hot, baste it for a  time with salt and water: then put a good spoonful of nice lard into the  dripping-pan, and when melted, continue to baste with it. When your  meat, of whatever kind, has been down some time, but before it begins to  look brown, cover it with paper and baste on it; when it is nearly done,  take off the paper, dredge it with flour, turn the spit for some minutes  very quick, and baste all the time to raise a froth--after which, serve  it up. When mutton is roasted, after you take off the paper, loosen the  skin and peel it off carefully, then dredge and froth it up. Beef and  mutton must not be roasted as much as veal, lamb, or pork; the two last  must be skinned in the manner directed for mutton. You may pour a little  melted butter in the dish with veal, but all the others must be served  without sauce, and garnished with horse-radish, nicely scraped. Be  careful not to let a particle of dry flour be seen on the meat--it has a  very ill appearance. Beef may look brown, but the whiter the other meats  are, the more genteel are they, and if properly roasted, they may be  perfectly done, and quite white. A loin of veal, and hind quarter of  lamb, should be dished with the kidneys uppermost; and be sure to joint  every thing that is to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#4)"],[1,"of congratulation.

[Illustration: ISLAND OF GOREE Published Aug 1 1807 by G & W Nicol]        In a military point of view, in its present condition, the island of Goree  is far from being a place of strength; but in a commercial, it is of  considerable importance; and, therefore, ought to claim the attention of  Government, if it attaches any consequence towards a commerce with the  coast of Africa. In a military character, its batteries and guns are in an  extremely bad condition; and it is completely a position where a piccaroon  privateer could check every supply from the continent, upon which it  depends for fresh provisions and water, and might carry on hostile  operations without the range of its batteries; which, by consequence,  always exposes this garrison to contingencies and casual supply. In a  commercial consideration, I view it as a possession of the greatest moment;  from its contiguity to the French settlement of the Senegal, and to a large  portion of that valuable district, which they claim and influence; from  whence accurate information may be obtained of their operations; and a  check may issue, to maintain our ascendency to leeward; besides a rallying  point for our outward bound ships, to ascertain the enemy's force upon the  coast; the deviation from a direct course to leeward being very  unimportant: moreover, it might be an eligible depot for the trade of that  infinitely valuable river, the Gambia, which, for variety of natural  productions, is perhaps not to be excelled by any other in the world; only  requiring the hand of industry and intelligence to fertilize and unfold.    The garrison of Goree has seldom more than 150 effective men to defend it,  of the royal African regiment, commanded by Major Lloyd;[1] and this force  is very fluctuating, from sickness  and the diseases of the climate; in  general, however, it is tolerably healthy, and its physical department is  superintended by a gentleman (Doctor Heddle) of very considerable  intelligence and ability in his profession. The hospitality of Major Lloyd,  and the officers of his corps, to their countrymen, is distinguished by  liberality; and during my stay in that island, which was upwards of three  weeks, I have to acknowledge their polite attentions. I was the inmate of  Mr. Hamilton, in the commissariat department, whose peculiar friendship and  kind offices have made a most indelible impression upon my mind.    The view from the roads, some of the buildings near the shore being of  stone, and upon even an elegant and convenient construction, is calculated  to raise expectation upon approaching it, which is considerably  lessened[**Transcriber's note: \"lessoned\" must be a typesetting error.]  upon a nearer view; the streets being extremely narrow, and the huts of the  natives huddled together without regularity or system. The inhabitants are  governed in their local customs and capacities by a native mayor, and his  advisers; but, of course, under the control of the commandant of the  garrison; and this privilege is a mere matter of form and courtesy, which a  lenient authority permits.

In our way to this miserable  habitation of royalty, a confused sound of voices issued forth from almost  every hut we passed, which originated from their inhabitants vociferating  their morning  orisons to Allah and Mahomet; their religion being an  heterogeneous system of Mahomedanism, associated with superstitious  idolatry, incantations, and charms.    We found _Marraboo's head men_ and priests assembled before his majesty's  dwelling _to give him service_, and to offer him their morning's  salutation. At length he made his appearance, followed by several of the  officers of the palace, carrying skins of wild beasts, and mats, which upon  enquiry, I found to have composed the royal bed, spread out upon a little  hurdle, erected about a foot and a half high, interwoven with bamboo canes:  my attention was much engaged with this novel sight; and I could not  contemplate the venerable old man, surrounded by his chiefs, without  conceiving I beheld one of the patriarchs of old, in their primaeval state.  After his chiefs had paid their obeisance, I presumed, accompanied by my  friends, to approach the royal presence; when he discovered us among the  group, his countenance underwent an entire change, expressive of reserve  and surprise, exclaiming, \"What did I want with Marraboo?\" With great  humility I replied, \"I be Englishman, come from King George's country, his  brother, to give him service.\" He replied with quickness, \"I be very glad  to see you, what service have you brought?\" I was aware of this tax upon my  civility, and replied, that \"I make him good service;\" which in plain  English was, that I shall make you a good present. He then conversed with  more freedom relative to his country, government, localities, and religion;  I suggested to him that \"I understood he was a powerful king, and a great  warrior, had many wives and children, that he ruled over much people, and a  fine country, that I hear he get much head, that he far pass any of his  enemies, and that I be very happy to look so great a king:\" or, in other  words, that I understood he was a great general, was very rich, was more  wise than all his contemporary chiefs, and that it gave me much pleasure to  pay my respects to so great a prince: but the former idiom of language is  best adapted to convey meaning to the interpreters of the chiefs of Africa,  in whatever tongue it may be spoken; being that which they use in  translation; and when they are addressed in this phraseology, they convey  their ideas with more perspicuity and literal interpretation. But to return  to the dialogue.    Marraboo.--\"I be very glad to look you for that, I have much trouble all my  life--great deal of war--my son some time since killed in battle.\" This was  accompanied by such a melancholy expression of countenance, that could not  fail to excite my compassion, I therefore avoided touching more on the  subject of his wars; only observing, \"that I hear he be too much for all  his enemies, and that he build great wall that keep his town and people  safe.\"    Marraboo.--\"The king of Darnel's people cannot pass that--they all be  killed--they come there sometimes, but always go back again.\" My curiosity  was excited to obtain the history of this _enchanted wall_, which on my  approach to the town, I had discovered to be apparently little more than  three or four feet high, and situated within the verge of their wells of  fresh water, open at several places, and without any defence.    Upon enquiry, I found that Marraboo had been early in life _fetish man_, or  high priest, to Damel, king of Cayor, a very powerful chief bordering upon  the Senegal, and that he had artfully contrived to gain over to his  interest a number of adherents, who, in process of time, became formidable,  rebelled against their lawful sovereign, and took possession of that part  of the country towards Cape Verd: to strengthen their position, Marraboo  caused a wall to be erected, commencing from the sea shore, and extending  towards the Cape; which, in the estimation of the natives, and in  consequence of his sacerdotal office, incantations, and charms, was  rendered invulnerable: the hypocritical priest well knew the natural  disposition of his countrymen, and the effect his exorcisms would produce  upon their minds; which operated so effectually, that when his army was  beaten by the powerful Damel, they uniformly retired behind their exorcised  heap of stones, which in a moment stopt their enemy's career, and struck  them with such dread, that they immediately retired to their country,  leaving their impotent enemy in quiet possession of his usurped territory;  whom otherwise they might have annihilated with the greatest facility.  Superstition is a delusion very prevalent in Africa; and its powerful  influence upon the human mind is forcibly illustrated by the foregoing  instance.    When I enquired of Marraboo the nature of his belief in a supreme being,  his observations were confused and perplexed, having no perspicuous  conception of his attributes or perfections, but an indistinct combination  of incomprehensibility; and to sum up the whole, he remarked, \"that he pass  all men, and was not born of woman.\"    A few days after the abovementioned visit, I made another excursion to the  main land, accompanied by Mr. Hamilton, and one of the principal  inhabitants of Goree, named Martin. We landed at a "]]]
