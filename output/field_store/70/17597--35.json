When civilized, as well as barbarous nations, have been found, through a  long succession of ages, uniformly to concur in the same customs, there  seems to arise a presumption, that such customs are not only eminently  useful, but are founded also on the principles of justice. Such is the  case with respect to _Slavery_: it has had the concurrence of all  the nations, which history has recorded, and the repeated practice of  ages from the remotest antiquity, in its favour. Here then is an  argument, deduced from the general consent and agreement of mankind, in  favour of the proposed subject: but alas! when we reflect that the  people, thus reduced to a state of servitude, have had the same feelings  with ourselves; when we reflect that they have had the same propensities  to pleasure, and the same aversions from pain; another argument seems  immediately to arise in opposition to the former, deduced from our own  feelings and that divine sympathy, which nature has implanted in our  breasts, for the most useful and generous of purposes. To ascertain the  truth therefore, where two such opposite sources of argument occur;  where the force of custom pleads strongly on the one hand, and the  feelings of humanity on the other; is a matter of much importance, as  the dignity of human nature is concerned, and the rights and liberties  of mankind will be involved in its discussion.    It will be necessary, before this point can be determined, to consult  the History of Slavery, and to lay before the reader, in as concise a  manner as possible, a general view of it from its earliest appearance to  the present day.    The first, whom we shall mention here to have been reduced to a state of  servitude, may be comprehended in that class, which is usually  denominated the _Mercenary_. It consisted of free-born citizens,  who, from the various contingencies of fortune, had become so poor, as  to have recourse for their support to the service of the rich. Of this  kind were those, both among the Egyptians and the Jews, who are recorded  in the sacred writings.[004] The Grecian _Thetes_[005] also were of  this description, as well as those among the Romans, from whom the class  receives its appellation, the [006]_Mercenarii_.    We may observe of the above-mentioned, that their situation was in many  instances similar to that of our own servants. There was an express  contract between the parties; they could, most of them, demand their  discharge, if they were ill used by their respective masters; and they  were treated therefore with more humanity than those, whom we usually  distinguish in our language by the appellation of _Slaves_.    As this class of servants was composed of men, who had been reduced to  such a situation by the contingencies of fortune, and not by their own  misconduct; so there was another among the ancients, composed entirely  of those, who had suffered the loss of liberty from their own  imprudence. To this class may be reduced the Grecian _Prodigals_,  who were detained in the service of their creditors, till the fruits of  their labour were equivalent to their debts; the _delinquents_, who  were sentenced to the oar; and the German _enthusiasts_, as  mentioned by Tacitus, who were so immoderately charmed with gaming, as,  when every thing else was gone, to have staked their liberty and their  very selves. \"The loser,\" says he, \"goes into a voluntary servitude, and  though younger and stronger than the person with whom he played,  patiently suffers himself to be bound and sold. Their perseverance in  so bad a custom is stiled honour. The slaves, thus obtained, are  immediately exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of  the scandal of his victory.\"    To enumerate other instances, would be unnecessary; it will be  sufficient to observe, that the servants of this class were in a far  more wretched situation, than those of the former; their drudgery was  more intense; their treatment more severe; and there was no retreat at  pleasure, from the frowns and lashes of their despotick masters.    Having premised this, we may now proceed to a general division of  slavery, into _voluntary_ and _involuntary_. The _voluntary_  will comprehend the two classes, which we have already mentioned;  for, in the first instance, there was a _contract_, founded  on _consent_; and, in the second, there was a _choice_ of  engaging or not in those practices, the known consequences of which  were servitude. The _involuntary_; on the other hand, will  comprehend those, who were forced, without any such _condition_ or  _choice_, into a situation, which as it tended to degrade a part of  the human species, and to class it with the brutal, must have been, of  all human situations, the most wretched and insupportable. These are  they, whom we shall consider solely in the present work. We shall  therefore take our leave of the former, as they were mentioned only,  that we might state the question with greater accuracy, and, be the  better enabled to reduce it to its proper limits.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 004: Genesis, Ch. 47.

But it was, after all, in Parliament that the battle must be fought; and  Mr. Buxton, of whose invaluable services in the House of Commons the  cause has lately been deprived, repeatedly, with the support of Messrs.  Wilberforce, William Smith, Brougham, Lushington, and others, urged the  necessity of interference upon the representatives of a people unanimous  in demanding it; and he repeatedly urged it in vain. The Government  always leaned towards the planter, and the most flimsy excuses were  constantly given for preferring to the effectual measures propounded by  the Abolitionists, the most flimsy of expedients, useless for any one  purpose, save that of making pretences and gaining time.    At length came the great case of the missionary Smith's persecution,  trial, and untimely death, when all the forms of judicature had been  prostituted, all the rules of law broken, all the principles of justice  outraged, by men assuming to sit in judgment as a court of criminal  jurisprudence; and though assisted by legal functionaries, exhibiting  such a spectacle of daring violation of the most received and best known  canons of procedure, as no civilized community ever before were called  upon to endure. This subject was immediately brought before Parliament  by Mr. Brougham, and his motion of censure, which might have been an  impeachment of the governor and the court of Demerara, was powerfully  supported by Mr. Wilberforce, the amiable, eloquent, and venerable  leader of the party, Mr. Denman, Mr. Williams, and Dr. Lushington, but  rejected by a majority of the Commons, whom Mr. Canning led, in a speech  little worthy of his former exertions against the Slave Trade, and far  from being creditable either to his judgment or to his principles. Yet  this memorable debate was of singular service to the cause. The great  speeches delivered were spread through all parts of the country; the  nakedness of the horrid system was exposed; the corruptions as well as  cruelty of slavery were laid bare; the determination of colonies to  protect its worst abuses was demonstrated; necessity of the  mother-country interfering with a strong hand was declared; and even the  loss of the motion showed the people of England how much their own  exertions were still required if they would see slavery extirpated, by  proving that upon them alone the fate of the execrable system hung.    The effects of this great debate cannot be over estimated. The case of  the missionary became the universal topic; The name of the martyred  Smith, the general rallying cry. The superior interest excited by  individual sufferings to any general misery inflicted upon masses of the  people, or any evil, however gigantic, which operates over a large  space, and in a course of time, has always been observed. The remark was  peculiarly applicable in this instance. Although all reflecting men had,  for many long years, been well aware of the evils pervading our colonial  system, and though the iniquity and perverseness of West Indian  judicatures had long been the topic of universal comment, yet this  single case of a persecuted individual falling a victim to those gross  perversions of law and justice which are familiar to the colonial  people, produced an impression far more general and more deep than all  that had ever been written or declaimed against system of West India  slavery; and looking back on the consummation of all our hopes in 1833  and 1838, we at once revert from this auspicious era to that ever  memorable occasion as having laid the solid foundation of our ultimate  triumph.    In this important day, which has thus by its effects proved decisive of  the Emancipation question, Mr. Stephen bore no part. He had long ceased  to adorn and enlighten the House of Commons. His retirement was the  result of honest differences of opinion respecting West India slavery  with his political friends, then in the plenitude of their power. Those  differences caused him to take the noble part, so rarely acted by  politicians, of withdrawing from Parliament rather than lend his great  support to men with whom he differed upon a question admitting no  compromise; and he devoted his exertions in private life to the  furtherance of the cause ever nearest his heart, the publication of his  able and elaborate work on the Colonial Slave Laws was the fruit of his  leisure; and had he never lent any other aid to the Emancipation, this  would alone have placed him high among its most able and effective  supporters. In all the consultations which were held before Mr.  Brougham's motion in 1824, he bore an active and useful part. In pushing  the advantages gained by the debate he was unwearied and successful.  Unhappily it pleased Providence that he should not receive here below  the final reward of his long and valued labours; for he was called to  his final repose some months before the Emancipation Bill passed into a  law.    There remains little to add, except that this measure, which was carried  with little opposition in 1833, owed its success in Parliament to the  ample bribe of twenty millions, by which the acquiescence of the West  Indians was purchased. The measure had hardly come into operation, when  all men perceived that the intermediate state of apprenticeship was  anything rather than a preparation for freedom, and anything rather than  a mitigation of slavery. It is due to some able and distinguished  friends of the negro race to state, that they all along were averse to  this plan of a transition state. Lord Howick, then in the Colonial  Office as Under-Secretary, went so far as to leave the department, from  his dislike of this part of the measure. Mr. Buxton and others protested  against it. Even its friends intimated that they wished the period of  apprenticeship to end in 1838 instead of 1840; but there was a general  belief of the preparatory step being necessary,--a belief apparently  founded on experience of the negro character, and indeed of the vicious  tendency of all slavery, to extinguish the power of voluntary labour, as  well as to make the sudden change to freedom unsafe for the peace of the  community. The fact soon dispersed these opinions. Antigua in a minute  emancipated all her slaves to the number of thirty thousand and upwards.  Not a complaint was ever heard of idleness or indolence; and, far from  any breach of the peace being induced by the sudden change in the  condition of the people, the Christmas of 1833 was the first, for the  last twenty years, that martial law was not proclaimed, in order to  preserve the public peace. Similar evidence from Jamaica and other  islands, proving the industrious and peaceable habits of the  apprentices, showed that there was nothing peculiar in the circumstances  of Antigua.    An important occurrence is now to be recorded as having exercised a  powerful influence upon the question of immediate emancipation. Joseph  Sturge, of Birmingham, a member of the Society of Friends, stricken with  a sense of the injustice perpetrated against the African race, repaired  to the West Indies, in order that he might examine, with his own eyes,  the real state of the question between the two classes. He was  accompanied by John Scoble and Thomas Harvey; and these able, excellent,  and zealous men returned in a few months with such ample evidence of the  effects produced by apprenticeship, and the fitness of the negroes for  liberty, that the attention of the community was soon awakened to the  subject, even more strenuously than it ever before had been; and the  walls of Parliament were soon made once more to ring with the sufferings  of the slave, only emancipated in name, and the injustice of withholding  from him any longer the freedom which was his indefeasible right, as  soon as he was shown capable of enjoying it beneficially for himself and  safely for the rest of the community.    In these transactions, both in Jamaica, where he is one of the largest  planters, and in Parliament, where he is one of the most respected  members, the Marquess of Sligo bore an eminent and an honourable part.  His praise has been justly sounded by all who have supported the cause  of negro freedom, and his conduct was by all admitted to be as much  marked by the disinterested virtue of a good citizen and amiable man, as  it was by the sagacity and ability of an enlightened statesman. Both as  governor of Jamaica, as the owner of slaves whom he voluntarily  liberated, and as a peer of Parliament, his patriotism, his humanity,  and his talents, shone conspicuously through this severe and glorious  struggle. While such was the conduct of those eminent philanthropists,  some difference of opinion prevailed among the other and older leaders  of the cause, chiefly grounded upon doubts whether the arrangement made  by Parliament in 1833, might not be regarded as a compact with the  planters which it would be unjust to violate by terminating their right  to the labour of the apprentices at a period earlier than the one fixed  in the Emancipation Act. A little consideration of the question at issue  soon dispelled those doubts, and removed every obstacle to united  exertion, by restoring entire unanimity of opinion. The slaves, it was  triumphantly affirmed, were no party to the compact. But moreover, the  whole arrangement of the apprenticeship was intended as a benefit to  them, by giving them the preparation thought to be required before they  could, safely for themselves, be admitted to unrestricted freedom,--not  as a benefit to the planters, whose acquiescence was purchased with the  grant of twenty millions.
