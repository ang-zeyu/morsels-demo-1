[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10771"],[0,"Philippine Folklore Stories (#4)"],[1,"  Many, however, linger on the benches or stroll along the beach,  watching the water curling upon the shore. As the waves reach the land  a soft light seems to spring from them and to break into thousands  of tiny stars. Now and then some one idly skips a stone over the  water. Where it touches, a little fountain of liquid fire springs  upward, and the water ripples away in gleaming circles that, growing  wider and wider, finally disappear in a flash of silvery light.    Of all the beauties of the Islands, the water of Manila Bay at night  ranks among the first. And those who ask why it flashes and glows  in this way are told the story of the silver shower that saved the  Pasig villages from the Moro Datto Bungtao.    Hundreds of years ago messengers came hurrying from the south of Luzon  with the news that the great Datto Bungtao, with many ships and men,  was on his way to the island to burn the villages and carry the people  away into slavery.    Then great fear came into the hearts of the people, for the fierce  Datto was the terror of the eastern seas, and all the southern islands  were reported captured. Nevertheless, they resolved to defend their  homes and save their people from shame and slavery.    The news proved true, for the Moro chief landed a great army on the  shore of the Bay of Batangas, and his fierce followers, with fire  and sword, started north to lay waste the country.    For a time they drove all before them, but soon Luzon was up in  arms against them and great numbers of warriors hurried southward to  battle with the Moros. All tribal feeling was forgotten and Tagalos,  Macabebes, Igorrotes, and Pangasinanes hurried southward in thousands.    The Moros presently found themselves checked by a large army of men  determined to save their homes or to die fighting.    Near the present town of Imus, in Cavite, a battle was fought and  the Moros were defeated. They then retreated southward, but great  numbers of Vicoles and Tinguianes rushed up from the southern part  of the island and blocked their way.    On the shore of the great Lake Bombon the final battle was fought. The  Moros were killed to a man, and with great rejoicing the tribes  returned north and south to their homes.    But in the meantime Bungtao had not been idle. After landing his men,  with his two hundred ships he set sail northward, never doubting that  his army would sweep all before it. A typhoon carried his fleet far  south into the China Sea, but he steered again for Luzon and three  weeks later was in sight of Corregidor Island.    He sailed down Manila Bay and drew up his fleet in front of the  villages on the Pasig River, the present site of Manila. On the shore  the people gathered in terror, for all the warriors had gone to fight  the invading army, and only old men and women and children remained  in the villages.    Hastily they called a council and finally decided to send a messenger  out to the Moro chief with all the gold and things of value they  possessed, thinking thus to satisfy the fierce Datto and save their  villages from harm.    Accordingly the women gave their rings and bracelets and the men  their bangles and chains. Everything of value was taken from the  houses. Even the temples of prayer were stripped and all the ornaments  taken. So great was the fear of the people that they even sent the  gold statue of the great god Captan that was the pride of the tribe,  whose members came miles to worship it.    As Bungtao was preparing to land and attack the town with his sailors,  the messenger in his canoe came alongside the ship and was at once  taken before the Datto. Trembling with fear, the old man, with signs,  begged for mercy for the people on the shore. He pointed to the  presents and offered them to Bungtao. Then, placing the golden image  of Captan at the feet of the Moro and bowing low, he again pleaded  for the women and children.    Bungtao laughed in scorn at the offer. On his island was gold enough to  satisfy his people. He needed slaves to work in the fields, for it was  beneath the dignity of such warriors as himself and his companions to  labor. So he kicked the messenger from him and, with a curse, picked  up the sacred golden image and threw it far over the water. Instantly  the sky grew dark and blackest night covered the land. The messenger  felt himself seized by invisible hands and carried to the shore.    Then suddenly the heavens opened, and a shower of silver fire rained on  the Moro boats. In vain the Moros tried to escape. The fire hemmed them  in on every side. Many leaped from the burning ships into the boiling  water. When the darkness cleared, boats and Moros had disappeared.    Joyfully the people on the shore ran to the temple of worship to pray  to Captan. What was their surprise to find the golden image of the  god in its usual place, and around it the bracelets and rings offered  to the Moros!    When the warriors, a few days later, returned from their great victory  in the south, they could hardly believe the story of the wonderful  escape of their people. But at night, when they saw the heretofore dull  waters dashing and breaking on the shore in crystals of silvery light,  they knew that it was Captan who had saved their homes and families.    The villages are a thing of the past. The modern city of Manila now  stands on the banks of the Pasig.    The nights here are very beautiful. The breeze sighs softly through  the palm trees and the golden moon gleams on the waters of Manila Bay.    On the shore the waves break gently and little balls of silver light  go rushing up the beach. Wise men say that the water is full of  phosphorus. But they have never heard the story of the Silver Shower.        The Faithlessness of Sinogo    Somewhere off the northern coast of Mindanao a strong current begins  to travel northward. It runs to the island of Siquijor and then,  turning slightly to the east, goes racing between the islands of Cebu  and Negros. At the narrow entrance between San Sebastian and Ayucatan  it breaks up into hundreds of small whirlpools that make the water  hiss and bubble for a distance of nearly three miles.    For steamers and large boats there is not the slightest danger,  but to the native in his little sacayan with its bamboo outriggers  these whirlpools are objects of dread and fear. He will go miles out  of his way to escape them. If you inquire as to the reason, he will  explain that the Liloan, or whirlpool, is a thing always to be avoided,  and then he will tell you the story of Sinogo.    Years and years ago, when Maguayan ruled the sea and the terrible  Captan launched his thunderbolts from above, the water and air were  filled with swimming and flying monsters. Those that lived in the air  were armed with great teeth and sharp claws; but, though they were  fierce and savage, they lived together in peace, for they feared the  anger of their master Captan.    In the sea, however, all was not so peaceful, for some of the  monsters were so huge and savage and so confident in their strength  that Maguayan could do nothing with them. He lived in constant fear  of attack from these fierce subjects and finally, in despair, called  on Captan to help him in his trouble.    Accordingly Captan sent his swift messengers to every part of the  earth, air, and sea, and ordered that a council of all the creatures  in the world should be held. He named the little island of Caueli in  the center of the Sulu Sea as the meeting place, and commanded all  to hasten there without delay.    Soon the members of the council began to arrive, and the sky was  darkened by flying monsters, and the water boiled as the terrible  reptiles of the sea rushed to the place appointed.    In a short time the little island was crowded with these dreadful  creatures. There were huge Buayas from Mindanao, fierce Tic-bolans  from Luzon, savage Sigbins from Negros and Bohol, hundreds of Unglocs  from Panay and Leyte, and great Uak Uaks and other frightful monsters  from Samar and Cebu. They grouped themselves in a large circle around  a golden throne on which sat Captan and Maguayan, and while waiting  the commands of their master filled the air with shrieks and howls.    At length Captan raised his hand and the noise instantly stopped. Then  he announced his decree. He said that Maguayan was his brother god  and should be treated with the same respect. He commanded all his  subjects to obey the god of the sea and told them that he would kill  with a thunderbolt any that disobeyed this order. Then he desired all  to return to their own regions, and again the air was filled with a  noise of thunder and the sea roared and foamed as the monsters went  back to their homes.    Soon there remained on the island only Captan, Maguayan, and  three messengers of Captan, who were called Sinogo, Dalagan, and  Guidala. These were giants in size and had large wings which enabled  them to fly with great swiftness. They had long spears and sharp  swords and were very brave and powerful. Of the three, Dalagan was  the swiftest, Guidala the bravest, and Sinogo the handsomest and best  loved by Captan.    When all the creatures were gone Maguayan thanked Captan, but  the great god said that he had only done his duty in helping his  brother. Then he gave Maguayan a little golden shell and explained  to him its wonderful power. Maguayan had but to put it in his mouth  and he could change his form to that of any creature he pleased. In  case a monster, defying Captan's orders, should attack him, he had  simply to change himself into a stronger monster of twice the size  of his enemy, and then fight and kill him easily.    Again Maguayan thanked his brother god and, taking the shell, placed  it on the throne beside him. Then Captan ordered his messengers to  bring food and drink, and soon the two gods were feasting merrily.    Now it happened that Sinogo had been standing behind the throne and  had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],[0,"Ancient and Modern Physics (#4)"],[1,"and Ether      It is not worthwhile translating Homer into English unless the  readers of the translation understand English.    It is not worthwhile attempting to translate the occult Eastern  physics into the language of our Western and modern physics,  unless those who are to read the translation understand generally  and broadly what our own modern physics teach.  It is not  necessary that they should know all branches of our modern  physics in all their minute ramifications;  but it is necessary  that they should understand clearly the fundamental principles  upon which our scientific and technical knowledge of today rests.    These fundamental principles have been discovered and applied in  the past fifty years--in the memory of the living.  They have  revolutionized science in all its departments.  Our textbooks on  Chemistry, Light, Heat, Electricity and Sound have had to be  entirely re-written;  and in many other departments, notably in  medicine and psychology, they have yet to be re-written.  Our  textbooks are in a transition state, each new one going a step  farther, to make the change gradual from the old forms of belief  to the new, so that even Tyndall's textbook on \"Sound\" is now so  antedated, or antiquated, that it might have been written in  darkest Africa before the pyramids were built, instead of twenty  years ago.    All this change has flowed from the discovery of Faraday that  there are two states or conditions of matter.  In one it is  revealed by one of our five senses, visible, tangible, smellable,  tastable, or ponderable matter.  This is matter as we know it.  It may be a lump of metal or a flask of gas.    The second condition or state of matter is not revealed by either  of our five senses, but by the sixth sense, or intuition of man.  This is the ether--supposed to be \"matter in a very rarefied  form, which permeates all space.\"  So rare and fine is this  matter that it interpenetrates carbon or steel as water  interpenetrates a sponge, or ink a blotting pad.  In fact, each  atom of \"physical\" matter--by which is meant matter in the first  condition--floats in an atmosphere of ether as the solid earth  floats in its atmosphere of air.    \"No two physical atoms touch,\" said Faraday.  \"Each physical atom  is the centre of an etheric molecule, and as far apart from every  other atom as the stars in heaven from one another.\"  This is  true of every form of physical matter, whether it is a lump of  metal, a cup of liquid, or a flask of gas;  whether it is a  bronze statue or a living man;  a leaf, a cloud, or the earth  itself.  Each and every physical atom is the centre of an etheric  molecule made up of many atoms of the ether.    This duality of matter was a wonderful discovery, revolutionizing  every department of science.  It placed man in actual touch with  the whole visible universe.  The ether in a man's eye (and in his  whole body) reaches in one unbroken line--like a telegraph wire  --from him to the sun, or the outermost planet.  He is not  separate and apart from \"space,\" but a part of it.  Each physical  atom of his physical body is the centre of an etheric molecule,  and he has two bodies, as St. Paul said, a visible physical and  an invisible etheric body;  the latter in actual touch with the  whole universe.    Faraday went one step further.  He demonstrated that all  physical phenomena come from the chording vibration of the  physical atom with the surrounding etheric atoms, and that the  latter exercise the impelling force on the former.  Step into the  sunshine.  The line of ether from the sun is vibrating faster  than the ether in the body, but the higher impels the lower, the  greater controls the lesser, and soon both ethers are in unison.  The physical atoms must coincide in vibration with their etheric  envelopes, and the \"note\" is \"heat.\"  Step into the shade, where  the ocean of ether is vibrating more slowly, and the ether of the  body reduces its vibration.  \"The ether is the origin of all  force and of all phenomena.\"    This etheric matter follows identical laws with prakritic matter,  or, accurately, the laws of our matter flow from the etheric  matter from which it is made.  The ether has two hundred or more  elementary substances, each atom of our eighty or ninety  \"elements\" being the chemical union of great masses of two or  more of the etheric elements or their combinations.  These  etheric elementary substances combine and unite;  our elementary  substances simply following in their combinations the law which  they inherit from their parents.  They take form and shape.  They  vibrate through one octave, and take solid liquid or gaseous form  in ether, as their types here in our world take it in prakriti,  as their vibrations are increased or diminished.  In short, the  ether is the prototype of our physical or prakritic world, out of  which it is made and a product of which it is.    As this ether is \"physical\" matter, the same as prakriti, one  harmonic law covering both, and as this ether fills all space,  Modern Science divides physical matter into two kinds, which, for  convenience in differentiation, are here called prakritic and  etheric.    Matter is something--science does not know or care to know what  --in vibration.  A very low octave of vibration produces  prakriti;  a very high octave of vibration produces ether.  The  vibration of prakriti ends in thousands;  that of ether begins in  billions.  Between them there is a gulf of vibrations that has  not yet been bridged.  For that reason science divides matter  into two \"planes,\" or octaves, of vibration--the matter of this  visible and tangible plane being called prakriti and that of the  invisible and intangible plane being called etheric.  Across this  gulf the two planes respond to each other, note for note, the  note in trillions chording when the note in thousands is struck.  Note for note, chord for chord, they answer one another, and the  minutest and the most complex phenomena are alike the result of  this harmonic vibration, that of the ether supplying Force and  that of the prakriti a Medium in which it can manifest.    This knowledge of ether is not guesswork or fancy, and, while it  is as impossible of proof as the axioms of geometry, it is worthy  the same credence and honor.  We are working on physical axioms  exactly as we work on geometrical axioms.    Modern science represents each and every prakritic atom as a  globe like the earth, floating in space and surrounded by an  atmosphere of ether.  \"The subdivision of prakritic matter until  we reach etheric atoms chemically united to make the physical  unit\" is the correct definition of an atom.  The prakritic  physical atom has length, breadth and thickness.  And it has an  atmosphere of ether which not only interpenetrates the atom as  oxygen and hydrogen interpenetrate the drop of water, but  furnishes it with an envelope as the oxygen and hydrogen furnish  the drop of water with one.    Each physical atom is the centre of an etheric molecule composed  of many etheric atoms vibrating at a greater or lesser speed and  interpenetrating the atom.  Each may be considered a miniature  earth, with its aerial envelope, the air, penetrating all parts  of it.    The etheric plane of matter not only unites with this prakritic  plane through the atom but it interpenetrates all combinations of  it;  beside the atom as well as through the atom.  The grain of  sand composed of many prakritic atoms is also composed of many  times that number of etheric atoms.  The grain of sand is etheric  matter as well as prakritic matter.  It exists on the etheric  plane exactly the same as it exists on the prakritic, and it has  etheric form as well as prakritic form.    As each atom of this physical world of ours--whether of land, or  water, or air;  whether of solid, liquid or gas--is the centre  of an etheric molecule, we have two worlds, not one:  a physical  world and an etheric one;  a visible world and an invisible  world;  a tangible world and an intangible world;  a world of  effect and a world of cause.    And each animal, including man, is made in the same way.  He has  a prakritic body and an etheric body;  a visible body and an  invisible body;  an earthly body and one \"not made with hands,\"  in common touch with the whole universe.          Chapter Four    What a Teacher Should Teach      Let us suppose that a certain wise teacher of physics places a  row of Bunsen burners under a long steel bar having a Daniell's  pyrometer at one end, and addresses his class (substantially) as  follows:    \"At our last lecture we found that the matter of the universe  permeated all space, but in two conditions, which we agreed to  call physical and etheric, or tangible and intangible.  It is all  the same matter, subject to the same laws, but differing in the  rate of vibration, the physical matter vibrating through one  great octave or plane, and the etheric vibrating through another  great octave or plane one degree higher--the chording vibration  of the matter of the two planes in one note producing what we  call energy or force, and with it phenomena.    \"This is a bar of steel 36 inches long.  It is composed of  physical atoms but no two physical atoms touch.  Each physical  atom is as far apart from every other atom as the stars in heaven  from one another--in proportion to their size.  The atoms and  the spaces between them are so small to our sight that they seem  to touch.  If we had a microscope of sufficient power to reveal  the atom, you would see that no two atoms touch, and that the  spaces between them are, as Faraday says, very great in  proportion to their size.  I showed you last term that what  appeared to be a solid stream of water, when magnified and thrown  upon a screen, was merely a succession of independent drops that  did not touch.
