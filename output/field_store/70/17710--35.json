After that, I cast another glance around me without  discovering anything. I advanced with short steps, carefully examining  the apartment. Nothing. I inspected every article one after the other.  Still nothing. I went over to the window. The shutters, large wooden  shutters, were open. I shut them with great care, and then drew the  curtains, enormous velvet curtains, and I placed a chair in front of  them, so as to have nothing to fear from without.    Then I cautiously sat down. The armchair was solid. I did not venture  to get into the bed. However, time was flying; and I ended by coming  to the conclusion that I was ridiculous. If they were spying on me, as  I supposed, they must, while waiting for the success of the joke they  had been preparing for me, have been laughing enormously at my terror.  So I made up my mind to go to bed. But the bed was particularly  suspicious-looking. I pulled at the curtains. They seemed to be  secure. All the same, there was danger. I was going perhaps to receive  a cold shower-bath from overhead, or perhaps, the moment I stretched  myself out, to find myself sinking under the floor with my mattress. I  searched in my memory for all the practical jokes of which I ever had  experience. And I did not want to be caught. Ah! certainly not!  certainly not! Then I suddenly bethought myself of a precaution which  I consider one of extreme efficacy: I caught hold of the side of the  mattress gingerly, and very slowly drew it toward me. It came away,  followed by the sheet and the rest of the bedclothes. I dragged all  these objects into the very middle of the room, facing the entrance  door. I made my bed over again as best I could at some distance from  the suspected bedstead and the corner which had filled me with such  anxiety. Then, I extinguished all the candles, and, groping my way, I  slipped under the bedclothes.    For at least another hour, I remained awake, starting at the slightest  sound. Everything seemed quiet in the chateau. I fell asleep.    I must have been in a deep sleep for a long time, but all of a sudden,  I was awakened with a start by the fall of a heavy body tumbling right  on top of my own body, and, at the same time, I received on my face, on  my neck, and on my chest a burning liquid which made me utter a howl of  pain. And a dreadful noise, as if a sideboard laden with plates and  dishes had fallen down, penetrated my ears.    I felt myself suffocating under the weight that was crushing me and  preventing me from moving. I stretched out my hand to find out what was  the nature of this object. I felt a face, a nose, and whiskers. Then  with all my strength I launched out a blow over this face. But I  immediately received a hail of cuffings which made me jump straight out  of the soaked sheets, and rush in my nightshirt into the corridor, the  door of which I found open.    O stupor! it was broad daylight. The noise brought my friends hurrying  into the apartment, and we found, sprawling over my improvised bed, the  dismayed valet, who, while bringing me my morning cup of tea, had  tripped over this obstacle in the middle of the floor, and fallen on  his stomach, spilling, in spite of himself, my breakfast over my face.    The precautions I had taken in closing the shutters and going to sleep  in the middle of the room had only brought about the interlude I had  been striving to avoid.    Ah! how they all laughed that day!        _Ghosts_      Just at the time when the _Concordat_ was in its most flourishing  condition, a young man belonging to a wealthy and highly respected  middle-class family went to the office of the head of the police at  P----, and begged for his help and advice, which was immediately  promised him.    \"My father threatens to disinherit me,\" the young man then began,  \"although I have never offended against the laws of the State, of  morality or of his paternal authority, merely because I do not share  his blind reverence for the Catholic Church and her Ministers. On that  account he looks upon me, not merely as Latitudinarian, but as a  perfect Atheist, and a faithful old manservant of ours, who is much  attached to me, and who accidentally saw my father's will, told me in  confidence that he had left all his property to the Jesuits. I think  this is highly suspicious, and I fear that the priests have been  maligning me to my father. Until less than a year ago, we used to live  very quietly and happily together, but ever since he has had so much to  do with the clergy, our domestic peace and happiness are at an end.\"    \"What you have told me,\" the official replied, \"is as likely as it is  regrettable, but I fail to see how I can interfere in the matter. Your  father is in full possession of all his mental faculties, and can  dispose of all his property exactly as he pleases. I also think that  your protest is premature; you must wait until his will can legally  take effect, and then you can invoke the aid of justice; I am sorry to  say that I can do nothing for you.\"    \"I think you will be able to,\" the young man replied; \"for I believe  that a very clever piece of deceit is being carried on here.\"    \"How? Please explain yourself more clearly.\"    \"When I remonstrated with him, yesterday evening, he referred to my  dead mother, and at last assured me, in a voice of the deepest  conviction, that she had frequently appeared to him, and had threatened  him with all the torments of the damned if he did not disinherit his  son, who had fallen away from God, and leave all his property to the  Church. Now I do not believe in ghosts.\"    \"Neither do I,\" the police director replied; \"but I cannot well do  anything on this dangerous ground if I had nothing but superstitions to  go upon. You know how the Church rules all our affairs since the  _Concordat_ with Rome, and if I investigate this matter, and obtain no  results, I am risking my post. It would be very different if you could  adduce any proofs for your suspicions. I do not deny that I should like  to see the clerical party, which will, I fear, be the ruin of Austria,  receive a staggering blow; try, therefore, to get to the bottom of this  business, and then we will talk it over again.\"    About a month passed without the young Latitudinarian being heard of;  but then he suddenly came one evening, evidently in a great state of  excitement, and told him that he was in a position to expose the  priestly deceit which he had mentioned, if the authorities would assist  him. The police director asked for further information.    \"I have obtained a number of important clews,\" the young man said. \"In  the first place, my father confessed to me that my mother did not  appear to him in our house, but in the churchyard where she is buried.  My mother was consumptive for many years, and a few weeks before her  death she went to the village of S----, where she died and was buried.  In addition to this, I found out from our footman that my father has  already left the house twice, late at night, in company of X----, the  Jesuit priest, and that on both occasions he did not return till  morning. Each time he was remarkably uneasy and low-spirited after his  return, and had three masses said for my dead mother. He also told me  just now that he has to leave home this evening on business, but  immediately he told me that, our footman saw the Jesuit go out of the  house. We may, therefore, assume that he intends this evening to  consult the spirit of my dead mother again, and this would be an  excellent opportunity for getting on the track of the matter, if you do  not object to opposing the most powerful force in the Empire, for the  sake of such an insignificant individual as myself.\"    \"Every citizen has an equal right to the protection of the State,\" the  police director replied; \"and I think that I have shown often enough  that I am not wanting in courage to perform my duty, no matter how  serious the consequences may be; but only very young men act without  any prospects of success, as they are carried away by their feelings.  When you came to me the first time, I was obliged to refuse your  request for assistance, but to-day your shares have risen in value. It  is now eight o'clock, and I shall expect you in two hours' time here in  my office. At present, all you have to do is to hold your tongue;  everything else is my affair.\"    As soon as it was dark, four men got into a closed carriage in the yard  of the police office, and were driven in the direction of the village  of S----; their carriage, however, did not enter the village, but  stopped at the edge of a small wood in the immediate neighborhood. Here  they all four alighted; they were the police director, accompanied by  the young Latitudinarian, a police sergeant and an ordinary policeman,  who was, however, dressed in plain clothes.    \"The first thing for us to do is to examine the locality carefully,\"  the police director said: \"it is eleven o'clock and the exercisers of  ghosts will not arrive before midnight, so we have time to look round  us, and to take our measure.\"    The four men went to the churchyard, which lay at the end of the  village, near the little wood. Everything was as still as death, and  not a soul was to be seen. The sexton was evidently sitting in the  public house, for they found the door of his cottage locked, as well as  the door of the little chapel that stood in the middle of the  churchyard.    \"Where is your mother's grave?\" the police director asked; but as there  were only a few stars visible, it was not easy to find it, but at last  they managed it, and the police director looked about in the  neighborhood of it.    \"The position is not a very favorable one for us,\" he said at last;  \"there is nothing here, not even a shrub, behind which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#4)"],[1,"his desk.  A notary appeared, who administered to them the oath  of loyalty and obedience.  These young men were at last actual  members of the brigade of midshipmen.    Commander Jephson now delivered a short address to the lined-up  dozen.  He pointed out where the lines of their duty lay, and  exhorted them to seek their duty and to perform it at all times.  In closing the commandant put emphasis on these words:    \"One word more, young gentlemen.  Until this moment perhaps all  of you have been wont to look upon yourself as boys.  That time  has passed.  From the moment that you were sworn into the Navy  of the United State--remember--you became men.  All of your  superior officers will now look to you to realize most fully that  you are men--men in word, deed, thought and judgment.\"    Now another midshipman, a cadet petty officer, appeared and conducted  the new members of the brigade outside.    \"Fall in by twos,\" he directed.  \"When I give the word, move forward  as well as you can, in the idea of marching.\"    It was, indeed, a busy hour that followed.  The young men were  led before the midshipmen's pay officer, with whom each deposited  the sum of two hundred and sixty-four dollars and ninety-eight  cents.  This amount from each new midshipman is required by law.  Of this sum sixty dollars is applied to the purchase of books  needed by the new midshipman.  The balance of the sum goes to  pay for uniforms, articles of equipment, etc.  From this it would  seem that an absolutely poor boy had no chance to enter the Naval  Academy.  It usually happens, however, that, when a very poor  boy is appointed to the Naval Academy, his Congressman, or some  of his friends or fellow townsmen will loan him the money, returnable  after he enters the service as an officer.    In addition to the amount required by law to be deposited with  the Academy authorities each midshipman is ordered to turn over  any other money that may be in his possession, this extra amount  to be credited to him.  A midshipman, on entering the service,  receives a salary of six hundred dollars a year.  Nearly all of  this, however, is required to pay his ordinary expenses.  Each  midshipman is allowed a very small amount of spending money, with,  however, a more liberal allowance when visiting ports during a  cruise.    It is forbidden for a midshipman to receive spending money from  home or friends.  Midshipmen sometimes disobey this latter regulation,  but, if detected, are liable to severe punishment.    Afterwards the new midshipmen were taken to the storekeeper's, where  each was supplied with one of the uniform caps worn by midshipmen.    Thence the young men were marched back to Bancroft Hall and out  onto the terrace over the mess hall.    \"Halt!  Break ranks!\" commanded their instructor, Midshipman Cranthorpe.  \"You will now pay close heed and endeavor to learn rapidly.  Mr.  Darrin, step over here.\"    Dave went forward, Midshipman Cranthorpe placing him.    \"The others will form in line of platoon front, using Mr. Darrin  as their guide,\" directed the young instructor.    Then followed some rapid-fire drilling in dressing, facings, counting  fours, marching and halting.  The material in hand was excellent,  or Midshipman Cranthorpe might have been in despair.    Presently their instructor gave the order to break ranks, showing  the new men where to stand, up against the building, out of the  way.  Almost immediately a bugler sounded a call.  Then the new  men were treated to a sight that made their blood dance.    Out of Bancroft Hall hastily poured scores and scores of midshipmen,  until nearly six hundred had assembled.  These were the members  of the three upper classes.    The brigade of midshipmen is divided into two battalions, each  of two divisions, six companies.  The first and fourth companies  formed on the right of the first battalion, the seventh and tenth  companies on the right of the second battalion.  The divisions  formed with intervals of two paces between companies preparatory  to muster.  Second call was sounded quickly on the bugle, immediately  after which the first petty officer of each company began briskly  to call the roll.  Each man answered just loudly enough to be  heard.  While roll-call was going on company commanders stepped  briskly along inspecting their companies.    As the muster of each company was completed the first petty officer  commanded, \"count off!\"    \"One, two, three, four!  One, two, three four!\" went the count  along each company line.  Then the first petty officer of each  company wheeled about, saluted his company commander, and reported:    \"Sir, all present or accounted for!\"    Company commanders next corrected the alignment on the right center  company of each line.    Battalion commanders, seeing the divisions of their respective  battalions aligned, faced about, while the battalion adjutants  took post to right and rear.  The brigade adjutant then faced  about, saluted the brigade commander, reporting: \"Sir, the brigade  is formed.\"    Receiving the word from his superior, the brigade adjutant next  read the orders, after which he was ordered to take his post.    While this was going on Midshipman Cranthorpe had formed his awkward  squad to the rear, behind the first battalion.    Now orders rang out crisply for battalion commanders to take charge.  Thereupon each battalion commander marched his command in column  of squads into the mess hall; battalion commanders preceding their  battalions, company commanders preceding their companies and the  junior officers of each company following the company.  Last of  all came Midshipman Cranthorpe's awkward squad.    And very awkward, indeed, these young men felt.  Each had a burning  conviction that he was being watched curiously by hundreds of  pairs of eyes.  The new men might as well have saved themselves  their worry.  Barely an upper class man in the hall was paying  any heed whatever to these self-conscious plebes.    The meal, a mid-day dinner, was an excellent one.  Few of the  new men, however, had any notion of what it consisted.    Mess hall was left with almost the same amount of formality.  In the short recreation period that followed the new men, painfully  conscious that their caps were the only part of the uniform they  wore, were hurried away by Midshipman Cranthorpe.    Now they were quickly assigned to the rooms that they would occupy  during their first year at the Naval Academy.    The midshipmen are not roomed by classes.  Instead, each is assigned  to a company, and there are three companies to a division.  Each  division occupies a floor in Bancroft Hall.  It is not called  a \"floor\" but a \"deck.\"  Dave and Dan were assigned to the armory  wing of the lowest deck, on what was virtually the basement floor  of Bancroft Hall, or would have been, but for the mess hall underneath.    As far as wood work went it was a handsome room.  When it came  to the matter of furniture it was plain enough.  There was the  main or study room.  Off at either side was an alcove bedroom.  There was also a closet in which stood a shower bath.  The one  window of the room looked over across the Academy grounds in the  direction of Academic Hall.    A cadet petty officer from the first class briefly, crisply instructed  them concerning the care of their room, and their duties within  its walls.    What followed that afternoon put the heads of the new midshipmen  in a whirl.  Afterwards they had a confused recollection of having  been marched to the tailor at the storekeeper's, where they were  measured for uniforms, all of which are made to order.  They recalled  receiving a thin, blue volume entitled \"Regulations of the U.S.  Naval Academy,\" a book which they were advised by a first clansman  instructor to \"commit to memory.\"    \"In former days, in the old-time academy, there were something  more than six hundred regulations,\" dryly remarked the cadet petty  officer in charge of them.  \"In the new up-to-date Naval Academy  there are now more than one thousand regulations.  You are all  expected to appreciate this merciful decrease in the number of  things you are required to remember.\"    There were also two periods of drill, that afternoon, and what-not  more.    Supper came as a merciful release.  When the meal was over, while  many of the upper class men remained outside in the warm June  air, the plebes were ordered to go to their rooms and start in  making themselves familiar with the thousand-and-more regulations.    \"Thank goodness they give us some time for light reading,\" muttered  Dan Dalzell, as he stalked into his room, hung up his uniform  cap and sank into a chair.  \"Whew!  What a day this has been!\"    \"I've rather enjoyed it,\" murmured Dave, as he sank into the chair  on the opposite side of the study table.    \"Huh!  You have liberal ideas, then, about enjoyment.  How many  hundred rules are you going to commit to memory tonight?    \"I don't know,\" returned Dave.  \"But I do know that my head is  in a big whirl, and that I'm going to rest it for a few minutes.  By the way, Dan, there's one thing I hope you remember.\"    \"What is that?\" demanded Dalzell.    \"What did they tell us this lower deck was named?\"    \"Dunno,\" grunted Dan.  \"But I have my own name for it.  _I_ call  it the pinochle deck.\"    \"I'm afraid that won't do to repeat,\" laughed Dave.    At that moment the handle of the door was turned.  Five upper  class midshipmen entered, closing the door behind them.  Then  they stood there, glaring at the two poor plebes in \"cit.\" clothes.          CHAPTER III    A TASTE OF HAZING      \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" nodded Dave pleasantly, as he rose  and stood by the study table, waiting to hear the pleasure of  his visitors.    Dan Dalzell favored his callers with a nod, but remained seated,  both hands thrust deep in his pockets.    \"Get up on your feet, mister!\" ordered one of the midshipmen,  so"]]]
