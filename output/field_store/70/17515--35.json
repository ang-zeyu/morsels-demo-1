It is of the greatest aid  in diagnosing and in noting the progress of the disease. The following  varieties of pulse may be mentioned: _frequent, infrequent, quick, slow,  large, small, hard, soft_ and _intermittent_. The terms frequent and  infrequent refer to the number of pulse beats in a given time; quick and  slow to the length of time required for the pulse wave to pass beneath the  finger; large and small to the volume of the wave; hard and soft to its  compressibility; and intermittent to the occasional missing of a beat. A  pulse beat that is small and quick, or large and soft, is frequently met  with in diseases of a serious character.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--The X on the lower border of the jaw indicates the  place where the pulse is taken.]    _The horse's pulse_ is taken from the submaxillary artery at a point  anterior to, or below the angle of the jaw and along its inferior border  (Fig. 3). It is here that the artery winds around the inferior border of  the jaw in an upward direction, and, because of its location immediately  beneath the skin, it can be readily located by pressing lightly over the  region with the fingers.    _Cattle's pulse_ is taken from the same artery as in the horse. The artery  is most superficial a little above the border of the jaw. It is more  difficult to find the pulse wave in cattle than it is in horses, because of  the larger amount of connective tissue just beneath the skin and the  heavier muscles of the jaw. A very satisfactory pulse may be found in the  small arteries located along the inferior part of the lateral region of the  tail and near its base.    _The sheep's pulse_ may be taken directly from the femoral artery by  placing the fingers over the inner region of the thigh. By pressing with  the hand over the region of the heart we may determine its condition.    _The hog's pulse_ can easily be taken from the femoral artery on the  internal region of the thigh. The artery crosses this region obliquely and  is quite superficial toward its anterior and lower portion.    _The dog's_ pulse is usually taken from the brachial artery. The pulse wave  can be readily felt by resting the fingers over the inner region of the arm  and just above the elbow. The character of the heart beats in dogs may be  determined by resting the hand on the chest wall.    RESPIRATION.--The frequency of the respirations varies with the species.  The following table gives the frequency of the respirations in domestic  animals:    Horse    8 to 10 per minute  Ox      12 to 15 per minute  Sheep   12 to 20 per minute  Dog     15 to 20 per minute  Pig     10 to 15 per minute    The ratio of the heart beats to the respirations is about 1:4 or 1:5. This  ratio is not constant in ruminants. Rumination, muscular exertion and  excitement increase the frequency and cause the respirations to become  irregular. In disease the ratio between the heart beats and respirations  is greatly disturbed, and the character of the respiratory sounds and  movements may be greatly changed (Fig. 4).    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Auscultation of the lungs can be practised to an  advantage over the outlined portion of the chest wall, only.]    Severe exercise and diseased conditions of the lungs cause the animal to  breathe rapidly and bring into use all of the respiratory muscles. Such  forced or labored breathing is a common symptom in serious lung diseases,  \"bloat\" in cattle, or any condition that may cause dyspnoea. Horses  affected with \"heaves\" show a double contraction of the muscles in the  region of the flank during expiration. In spasm of the diaphragm or  \"thumps\" the expiration appears to be a short, jerking movement of the  flank. In the abdominal form of respiration the movements of the walls of  the chest are limited. This occurs in pleurisy. In the thoracic form of  respiration the abdominal wall is held rigid and the movement of the chest  walls make up for the deficiency. This latter condition occurs in  peritonitis.    _A cough_ is caused by irritation of the membrane lining the air passages.  The character of the cough may vary according to the nature of the disease.  We may speak of a moist cough when the secretions in the air passages are  more or less abundant. A dry cough occurs when the lining membrane of the  air passages is dry and inflamed. This may occur in the early stage of the  inflammation, or as a result of irritation from dust or irritating gases.  Chronic cough occurs when the disease is of long duration or chronic. In  pleurisy the cough may be short and painful, and in broken wind, deep and  suppressed. In parasitic diseases of the air passages and lungs, the  paroxysm of coughing may be severe and \"husky\" in character.    The odor of the expired air, the character of the discharge and the  respiratory sounds found on making a careful examination are important aids  in arriving at a correct diagnosis, and in studying the progress of the  disease.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Fever thermometer.]    Body Temperature.--The body temperature of an animal is taken by inserting  the fever thermometer into the rectum. In large animals a five-inch, and in  small animals a four-inch fever thermometer is used. It should be inserted  full length and left in position from one and one-half to three minutes,  depending on the rapidity with which it registers (Fig. 5).    The average normal body temperatures of domestic animals are as follows:    Horses  100.5\\260 F.  Cattle  101.4\\260 F.  Sheep   104.0\\260 F.  Swine   103.0\\260 F.  Dog     101.4\\260 F.    There is a wide variation in the body temperatures of domestic  animals. This is especially true of cattle, sheep and hogs. In order to  determine the normal temperature of an animal, it may be necessary to take  two or more readings at different times, and compare them with the body  temperatures of other animals in the herd that are known to be healthy.    Exercise, feeding, rumination, excitement, warm, close stables, exposure to  cold and drinking ice cold water are common causes of variations in the  body temperatures of domestic animals.    Visible Mucous Membranes.--The visible mucous membranes, as they are  termed, are the lining membranes of the eyelids, nostrils and nasal  cavities, and mouth. In health they are usually a pale red, excepting when  the animal is exercised or excited, when they appear a brighter red and  somewhat vascular. In disease the following changes in color and appearance  may be noted: When inflamed, as in cold in the head, a deep red; in  impoverished or bloodless conditions of the body and in internal  haemorrhage, pale; in diseases of the liver, sometimes yellowish, or dark  red; in diseases of the digestive tract (buccal mucous membrane), coated;  if inflamed, dry at first, later excessively moist; and in certain germ  diseases a mottled red, or showing nodules, ulcers and scars.    Surface of the Body.--When a horse is in a good condition and well cared  for, the coat is short, fine, glossy and smooth and the skin pliable and  elastic. Healthy cattle have a smooth, glossy coat and the skin feels  mellow and elastic. The fleece of sheep should appear smooth and have  plenty of yolk, the skin pliable and light pink in color. When the coat  loses its lustre and gloss and the skin becomes hard, rigid, thickened and  dirty, it indicates a lack of nutrition and an unhealthy condition of the  body. In sheep, during sickness, the wool may become dry and brittle and  the skin pale and rigid. When affected with external parasites, the hair or  wool becomes dirty and rough, a part of the skin may be denuded of hair,  and it appears thickened, leathery and scabby, or shows pimples, vesicles  and sores.    During fever, the temperature of the surface of the body is very unequal.  In serious diseases or diseases that are about to terminate fatally, the  skin feels cold and the hair is wet with sweat.    When animals are allowed to \"rough it\" during the cold weather, the coat of  hair becomes heavy and rough. This is a provision of nature and enables  them, as long as the coat is dry, to withstand severe cold.    Horses that are in a low physical condition, or when accustomed to hard  work, if then kept in a stall for a few days without exercise, commonly  show a filling of the cannon regions of the posterior extremities. This  condition also commonly occurs in disease and in mares that have reached  the latter period of pregnancy. Sheep that are unthrifty and in a poor  physical condition, especially if this is due to internal parasites,  frequently develop dropsical swellings in the region of the jaw, or neck.    Body Excretions.--The character of the body excretions, faeces and urine  may become greatly changed in certain diseases. It is important that the  stockman or veterinarian observe these changes, and in certain diseases  make an analysis of the urine. This may be necessary in order properly to  diagnose the case.    Behavior of the Animal.--When the body temperature is high, the animal may  appear greatly depressed. If suffering severe pain, it may be restless. In  diseases of the nervous system, the behavior of the animal may be greatly  changed. Spasms, convulsions, general local paralysis, stupid condition and  unconsciousness may occur as symptoms of this class of disease.      QUESTIONS    1. What information is necessary in order to be able to recognize or     diagnose disease? 2. What are the general symptoms of disease?    3. What are the subjective symptoms of disease?    4.

Is the condition of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8508"],[0,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved in 50 Arguments (#3)"],[1,"theory.    That their guesses can not possibly be correct, is proven also by  approaching the subject from another angle. If the human race is  2,000,000 years old, and must double its numbers 30.75 times to make  the present population, it is plain that each period for doubling  would be 65,040 years, since {2,000,000/30.75} = 65,040. At that rate,  there would be fewer than four Jews! If we suppose the race to have  sprung from one pair 100,000 years ago, it would take 3252 years to  double the population. At this rate, there would be five Jews!    Do we need any other demonstration that the evolution of man is an  absurdity and an impossibility? If the evolutionists endeavor to show  that man _may_ have descended from the brute, the population of  the world conclusively shows that MAN CERTAINLY DID NOT DESCEND FROM  THE BRUTE. If they ever succeed in showing that all species of animals  _may_ have been derived from one primordial germ, it is  impossible that man so came. He was created as the Bible declares, by  the Almighty Power of God.    The testimony of all the experts in the famous Scopes trial in  Tennessee (who escaped cross-examination) was to the effect that  evolution was in harmony with _some_ facts and therefore  _possibly true_. The above mathematical calculations prove that  the evolution of man was certainly not true. They fail to make their  case even if we grant their claims. These figures prove the Bible  story, and scrap every guess of the great age and the brute origin of  man. It will be observed that the above calculations point to the  unity of the race in the days of Noah, 5177 years ago, rather than in  the days of Adam 7333 years ago, according to Hales' chronology. If  the race increased at the Jewish rate, not over 16,384 perished by the  Flood, fewer than by many a modern catastrophe. This most merciful  providence of God started the race anew with a righteous head.    Now, if there had been no flood to destroy the human race, then the  descendants of Adam, in the 7333 years, would have been 16,384 times  the 1,804,187,000, or 29,559,799,808,000; or computed at the Jewish  rate of net increase for 7333 years since Adam, the population would  have been still greater, or 35,184,372,088,832. These calculations are  in perfect accord with the Scripture story of the special creation of  man, and the destruction of the race by a flood. Had it not been for  the flood, the earth could not have sustained the descendants of  Adam. Is not this a demonstration, decisive and final?        2. THE UNITY OF LANGUAGES      The unity of the languages of the world proves the recent common  origin of man. Prof. Max Muller, and other renowned linguists,  declared that all languages are derived from one. This is abundantly  proven by the similarity of roots and words, the grammatical  construction and accidents, the correspondence in the order of their  alphabets, etc. The words for father and mother similar in form, for  example, are found in many languages in all the five great groups, the  Aryan, the Semitic, the Hamitic the Turanian and Chinese groups,  showing a common original language and proving the early existence of  the home and civilization. The similarity of these and many other  words in all of the great Aryan or Indo-European family of languages,  spoken in all continents is common knowledge.  Lord Avebury names 85  Hamitic languages in Africa in which the names of father and mother  are similar; 29 non-Aryan languages in Asia and Europe, including  Turkish, Thibetan, and many of the Turanian and Chinese groups; 5 in  New Zealand and other Islands; 8 in Australia; and 20 spoken by  American Indians. The French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese are  daughters of the Latin; Latin is a daughter of the Aryan; and the  Aryan, together with the other sister languages is, no doubt, the  daughter of the original language spoken by Noah and his immediate  descendants.  There can not well be more than 4 generations of  languages, and the time since Noah is sufficient for the development  of the 1000 languages and dialects. The American Indians have  developed about 200 in 3,000 or 4,000 years. The life of a language  roughly speaking, seems to range from 1000 to 3,000 years. The time  since Noah is sufficient for the development of all the languages of  the world. But if man has existed for 2,000,000 or 1,000,000 years,  with a brain capacity ranging from 96% to normal, there would have  been multiplied thousands of languages bearing little or no  resemblance. There is not a trace of all these languages. They were  never spoken because no one lived to speak them.    Many linguists insist that the original language of mankind consisted  of a few short words, possibly not over 200, since many now use only  about 300. The Hebrew has only about 500 root words of 3 letters; the  stagnant Chinese, 450; the Sanscrit, about the same. All the Semitic  languages have tri-literal roots. As the tendency of all languages is  to grow in the number and length of words, these consisting of a few  small words must have been close to the original mother tongue. No  language could have come down from the great antiquity required by  evolution and have so few words. Johnson's Eng. Dictionary had 58,000  words; modern Dictionaries over 300,000. The evidence points to the  origin and unity of languages in the days of Noah, and proves the  great antiquity of man an impossibility and his evolution a pitiful  absurdity.        3. RELIGIONS      The unity of ancient religions proves the creation of man who received  a divine revelation. According to evolution, all religions were  evolved or invented by humanoids.  In that case, we would expect them  to be widely divergent; and we would be surprised, if they agreed on  great and important points, and especially on points which could not  be clearly arrived at by reason. For instance, what in reason teaches  us that an animal sacrifice is a proper way to worship God? How could  unassisted reason ever arrive at the conclusion that God is properly  worshipped by sacrificing a sheep or an ox? If we grant that one  section of the anthropoid host might have stumbled on the idea, how  can we account for its prevalence or its universality?  A very high  authority says, \"Sacrifices were common to all nations of antiquity,  and therefore, traced by some to a personal revelation.\" By  revelation, we learn that the animal sacrifice prefigured the Lamb  slain on Calvary. It was revealed. No race of monkey-men could ever  have invented the idea.    The most ancient nations worshipped God by sacrifices.  Homer's Iliad  (1000 B. C.) and other works of Grecian poets are full of it. All the  classics, Greek and Latin, are crowded with accounts of offerings. The  earliest records of the Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hindus and  Chinese speak of sacrifices long in vogue. This unity of religions on  the point of animal sacrifices bespeaks revelation and not evolution.    The division of time into weeks of 7 days, prevalent among the  ancients, suggests an ancient revelation in commemoration of creation  as against evolution, which denies creation. The following statements  from Dr. J. R. Dummelow, an eminent commentator, show that the  Babylonians both divided time into weeks, and offered sacrifices,  pointing to the unity of religions. \"The Babylonians observed the 7th,  14th, 21st and 28th of each lunar month as days when men were  subjected to certain restrictions; the king was not to eat food  prepared by fire, _nor offer sacrifice,_ nor consult an oracle,  nor invoke curses on his enemies.\" They also observed the 19th of each  month. It was customary, therefore, in the days of Abraham, for the  Babylonians to offer sacrifices and to observe the 7th day as  especially sacred. This can only be accounted for upon the assumption,  that God had revealed to the human race that creation occupied 6 days  or periods, and the 7th was to be observed,--all of which was  doubtless handed down by tradition. There were priests and temples in  the most ancient empire known.    Dr. Dummelow says: \"It is now widely admitted that the Genesis account  of creation contains elements of belief which existed perhaps  thousands of years before the book of Genesis was written, among the  peoples of Babylonia and Assyria.\" Many of the primeval revelations  were handed down by tradition. God communed with Adam.  There are many  relics of the original religion: the division of time into weeks, and  the institution of the Sabbath day; the sacrifices so common in the  ancient religions; the general existence of priests and temples in all  ages, and among all nations; marriage, the divinely authorized pillar  of society; the early institution of the family, and the use of the  root words for father and mother, in all the most ancient languages,  and families of languages, as well as in the scattered languages of  the earth spoken by the most savage. The belief in the immortality of  the soul, is well nigh universal, even among tribes, who, unlike  Plato, possess no power to reason it from the light of nature. In  contrast, we behold the sorry spectacle of the anthropoid  evolutionists of our day trying to drive from the hearts of men the  hope of immortality by their \"science falsely so-called.\"  The burial  of the dead is, no doubt, a relic, since animals, even of the monkey  tribe, do not bury their dead.        4. PLACE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN      The unity of the human race is further proved by the fact that it  originated in one locality and not in many.  The locality is the one  described by Moses. And the fact that Moses correctly located the  beginning of the race, when he himself had no personal knowledge,  proves that he was inspired and taught of God. He never could have  guessed the spot to which history and the migration of nations point,  and which the evolutionists themselves are obliged to"]]]
