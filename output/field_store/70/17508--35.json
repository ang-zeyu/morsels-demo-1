FILIPINO POPULAR TALES        PART I    HERO TALES AND DROLLS.      TALE 1    SUAN'S GOOD LUCK.      Narrated by Macaria Garcia. The story is popular among the Pampangans.      There was once an old woman who had an only son named Suan. [2] Suan  was a clever, sharp-witted boy. His mother sent him to school. Instead  of going to school, however, Suan climbed up the tree that stood by  the roadside. As soon as his mother had passed by from the market,  Suan hurried home ahead of her. When she reached home, he cried,  \"Mother, I know what you bought in the market to-day.\" He then told  her, article by article. This same thing happened so repeatedly,  that his mother began to believe in his skill as a diviner.    One day the ring of the datu's [3] daughter disappeared. All the people  in the locality searched for it, but in vain. The datu called for  volunteers to find the lost ring, and he offered his daughter's hand  as a prize to the one who should succeed. Suan's mother heard of the  proclamation. So she went to the palace and presented Suan to the datu.    \"Well, Suan, to-morrow tell me where the ring is,\" said the datu.    \"Yes, my lord, I will tell you, if you will give your soldiers over  to me for to-night,\" Suan replied.    \"You shall have everything you need,\" said the datu.    That evening Suan ordered the soldiers to stand around him in a  semicircle. When all were ready, Suan pointed at each one of them,  and said, \"The ring is here, and nowhere else.\" It so happened that  Suan fixed his eyes on the guilty soldier, who trembled and became  pale. \"I know who has it,\" said Suan. Then he ordered them to retire.    Late in the night this soldier came to Suan, and said, \"I will get  the ring you are in search of, and will give it to you if you will  promise me my safety.\"    \"Give it to me, and you shall be safe,\" said Suan.    Very early the next morning Suan came to the palace with a turkey in  his arms. \"Where is the ring?\" the datu demanded. \"Why, sir, it is in  this turkey's intestines,\" Suan replied. The turkey was then killed,  and the ring was found inside it.    \"You have done very well, Suan. Now you shall have my daughter's hand,\"  said the datu. So Suan became the princess's husband.    One day the datu proposed a bet with any one who wished to prove  Suan's skill. Accordingly another datu came. He offered to bet seven  cascos [4] of treasure that Suan could not tell the number of seeds  that were in his orange. Suan did not know what to do. At midnight  he went secretly to the cascos. Here he heard their conversation,  and from it he learned the number of seeds in the orange.    In the morning Suan said boastfully, \"I tell you, your orange has  nine seeds.\" Thus Suan won the whole treasure.    Hoping to recover his loss, the datu came again. This time he had  with him fourteen cascos full of gold. He asked Suan to tell him  what was inside his golden ball. Suan did not know what to say. So  in the dead of night he went out to the cascos, but he could learn  nothing there. The next morning Suan was summoned into the presence  of the two datus. He had no idea whatever as to what was in the ball;  so he said scornfully, \"Nonsense!\"    \"That is right, that is right!\" shouted a man. \"The ball contains nine  cents.\" Consequently Suan won the fourteen cascos full of gold. From  now on, nobody doubted Suan's merit.      Suan Eket.    Narrated by Manuel Reyes, a Tagalog from Rizal province. He heard  the story from his grandfather.    Many years ago there lived in the country of Campao a boy named  Suan. While this boy was studying in a private school, it was said  that he could not pronounce the letter x very well--he called it  \"eket.\" So his schoolmates nick-named him \"Suan Eket.\"    Finally Suan left school, because, whenever he went there, the other  pupils always shouted at him, \"Eket, eket, eket!\" He went home,  and told his mother to buy him a pencil and a pad of paper. \"I am  the wisest boy in our town now,\" said he.    One night Suan stole his father's plough, and hid it in a creek near  their house. The next morning his father could not find his plough.    \"What are you looking for?\" said Suan.    \"My plough,\" answered his father.    \"Come here, father! I will guess where it is.\" Suan took his pencil and  a piece of paper. On the paper he wrote figures of various shapes. He  then looked up, and said,--              \"Ararokes, ararokes,          Na na nakawes          Ay na s'imburnales,\"--      which meant that the plough had been stolen by a neighbor and hidden  in a creek. Suan's father looked for it in the creek near their house,  and found it. In great wonder he said, \"My son is truly the wisest  boy in the town.\" News spread that Suan was a good guesser.    One day as Suan was up in a guava-tree, he saw his uncle Pedro  ploughing. At noon Pedro went home to eat his dinner, leaving the  plough and the carabao [5] in the field. Suan got down from the tree  and climbed up on the carabao's back. He guided it to a very secret  place in the mountains and hid it there. When Pedro came back, he  could not find his carabao. A man who was passing by said, \"Pedro,  what are you looking for?\"    \"I am looking for my carabao. Somebody must have stolen it.\" \"Go to  Suan, your nephew,\" said the man. \"He can tell you who stole your  carabao.\" So Pedro went to Suan's house, and told him to guess who  had taken his carabao.    Suan took his pencil and a piece of paper. On the paper he wrote some  round figures. He then looked up, and said,              \"Carabaues, carabaues,          Na nanakawes          Ay na sa bundokes,\"--      which meant that the carabao was stolen by a neighbor and was hidden  in the mountain. For many days Pedro looked for it in the mountain. At  last he found it in a very secret place. He then went to Suan's house,  and told him that the carabao was truly in the mountain. In great  wonder he said, \"My nephew is surely a good guesser.\"    One Sunday a proclamation of the king was read. It was as follows:  \"The princess's ring is lost. Whoever can tell who stole it shall have  my daughter for his wife; but he who tries and fails, loses his head.\"    When Suan's mother heard it, she immediately went to the palace,  and said, \"King, my son can tell you who stole your daughter's ring.\"    \"Very well,\" said the king, \"I will send my carriage for your son to  ride to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#3)"],[1,"in his wealth; and  greatly he desired to behold the Colchian land and Aeetes himself the  ruler of the Colchians.    (ll. 176-178) Asterius and Amphion, sons of Hyperasius, came from  Achaean Pellene, which once Pelles their grandsire founded on the brows  of Aegialus.    (ll. 179-184) After them from Taenarus came Euphemus whom, most  swift-footed of men, Europe, daughter of mighty Tityos, bare to  Poseidon. He was wont to skim the swell of the grey sea, and wetted not  his swift feet, but just dipping the tips of his toes was borne on the  watery path.    (ll. 185-189) Yea, and two other sons of Poseidon came; one Erginus, who  left the citadel of glorious Miletus, the other proud Ancaeus, who  left Parthenia, the seat of Imbrasion Hera; both boasted their skill in  seacraft and in war.    (ll. 190-201) After them from Calydon came the son of Oeneus, strong  Meleagrus, and Laocoon--Laocoon the brother of Oeneus, though not by the  same mother, for a serving-woman bare him; him, now growing old, Oeneus  sent to guard his son: thus Meleagrus, still a youth, entered the  bold band of heroes. No other had come superior to him, I ween, except  Heracles, if for one year more he had tarried and been nurtured among  the Aetolians. Yea, and his uncle, well skilled to fight whether with  the javelin or hand to hand, Iphiclus son of Thestius, bare him company  on his way.    (ll. 202-206) With him came Palaemonius, son of Olenian Lernus, of  Lernus by repute, but his birth was from Hephaestus; and so he was  crippled in his feet, but his bodily frame and his valour no one would  dare to scorn. Wherefore he was numbered among all the chiefs, winning  fame for Jason.    (ll. 207-210) From the Phocians came Iphitus sprung from Naubolus son of  Ornytus; once he had been his host when Jason went to Pytho to ask for  a response concerning his voyage; for there he welcomed him in his own  hails.    (ll. 211-223) Next came Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, whom once  Oreithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, bare to Boreas on the verge of wintry  Thrace; thither it was that Thracian Boreas snatched her away from  Cecropia as she was whirling in the dance, hard by Hissus' stream. And,  carrying her far off, to the spot that men called the rock of Sarpedon,  near the river Erginus, he wrapped her in dark clouds and forced her  to his will. There they were making their dusky wings quiver upon their  ankles on both sides as they rose, a great wonder to behold, wings that  gleamed with golden scales: and round their backs from the top of the  head and neck, hither and thither, their dark tresses were being shaken  by the wind.    (ll. 224-227) No, nor had Acastus son of mighty Pelias himself any will  to stay behind in the palace of his brave sire, nor Argus, helper of the  goddess Athena; but they too were ready to be numbered in the host.    (ll. 228-233) So many then were the helpers who assembled to join the  son of Aeson. All the chiefs the dwellers thereabout called Minyae, for  the most and the bravest avowed that they were sprung from the blood of  the daughters of Minyas; thus Jason himself was the son of Alcimede who  was born of Clymene the daughter of Minyas.    (ll. 234-241) Now when all things had been made ready by the thralls,  all things that fully-equipped ships are furnished withal when men's  business leads them to voyage across the sea, then the heroes took their  way through the city to the ship where it lay on the strand that men  call Magnesian Pagasae; and a crowd of people hastening rushed together;  but the heroes shone like gleaming stars among the clouds; and each man  as he saw them speeding along with their armour would say:    (ll. 242-246) \"King Zeus, what is the purpose of Pelias? Whither is he  driving forth from the Panachaean land so great a host of heroes? On one  day they would waste the palace of Aeetes with baleful fire, should he  not yield them the fleece of his own goodwill. But the path is not to be  shunned, the toil is hard for those who venture.\"    (ll. 247-250) Thus they spake here and there throughout the city; but  the women often raised their hands to the sky in prayer to the immortals  to grant a return, their hearts' desire. And one with tears thus  lamented to her fellow:    (ll. 251-260) \"Wretched Alcimede, evil has come to thee at last though  late, thou hast not ended with splendour of life. Aeson too, ill-fated  man! Surely better had it been for him, if he were lying beneath the  earth, enveloped in his shroud, still unconscious of bitter toils. Would  that the dark wave, when the maiden Helle perished, had overwhelmed  Phrixus too with the ram; but the dire portent even sent forth a human  voice, that it might cause to Alcimede sorrows and countless pains  hereafter.\"    (ll. 261-277) Thus the women spake at the departure of the heroes. And  now many thralls, men and women, were gathered together, and his mother,  smitten with grief for Jason. And a bitter pang seized every woman's  heart; and with them groaned the father in baleful old age, lying on his  bed, closely wrapped round. But the hero straightway soothed their pain,  encouraging them, and bade the thralls take up his weapons for war; and  they in silence with downcast looks took them up. And even as the mother  had thrown her arms about her son, so she clung, weeping without stint,  as a maiden all alone weeps, falling fondly on the neck of her hoary  nurse, a maid who has now no others to care for her, but she drags on a  weary life under a stepmother, who maltreats her continually with ever  fresh insults, and as she weeps, her heart within her is bound fast  with misery, nor can she sob forth all the groans that struggle for  utterance; so without stint wept Alcimede straining her son in her arms,  and in her yearning grief spake as follows:    (ll. 278-291) \"Would that on that day when, wretched woman that I am, I  heard King Pelias proclaim his evil behest, I had straightway given up  my life and forgotten my cares, so that thou thyself, my son, with thine  own hands, mightest have buried me; for that was the only wish left me  still to be fulfilled by time, all the other rewards for thy nurture  have I long enjoyed. Now I, once so admired among Achaean women,  shall be left behind like a bondwoman in my empty halls, pining away,  ill-fated one, for love of thee, thee on whose account I had aforetime  so much splendour and renown, my only son for whom I loosed my virgin  zone first and last. For to me beyond others the goddess Eileithyia  grudged abundant offspring. Alas for my folly! Not once, not even in nay  dreams did I forebode this, that the flight of Phrixus would bring me  woe.\"    (ll. 292-294) Thus with moaning she wept, and her handmaidens, standing  by, lamented; but Jason spake gently to her with comforting words:    (ll. 295-305) \"Do not, I pray thee, mother, store up bitter sorrows  overmuch, for thou wilt not redeem me from evil by tears, but wilt still  add grief to grief. For unseen are the woes that the gods mete out to  mortals; be strong to endure thy share of them though with grief in thy  heart; take courage from the promises of Athena, and from the answers of  the gods (for very favourable oracles has Phoebus given), and then from  the help of the chieftains. But do thou remain here, quiet among thy  handmaids, and be not a bird of ill omen to the ship; and thither my  clansmen and thralls will follow me.\"    (ll. 306-316) He spake, and started forth to leave the house. And as  Apollo goes forth from some fragrant shrine to divine Delos or Claros or  Pytho or to broad Lyeia near the stream of Xanthus, in such beauty moved  Jason through the throng of people; and a cry arose as they shouted  together. And there met him aged Iphias, priestess of Artemis guardian  of the city, and kissed his right hand, but she had not strength to say  a word, for all her eagerness, as the crowd rushed on, but she was left  there by the wayside, as the old are left by the young, and he passed on  and was gone afar.    (ll. 317-331) Now when he had left the well-built streets of the city,  he came to the beach of Pagasae, where his comrades greeted him as they  stayed together near the ship Argo. And he stood at the entering in,  and they were gathered to meet him. And they perceived Aeastus and Argus  coming from the city, and they marvelled when they saw them hasting with  all speed, despite the will of Pelias. The one, Argus, son of Arestor,  had cast round his shoulders the hide of a bull reaching to his feet,  with the black hair upon it, the other, a fair mantle of double fold,  which his sister Pelopeia had given him. Still Jason forebore from  asking them about each point but bade all be seated for an assembly. And  there, upon the folded sails and the mast as it lay on the ground,  they all took their seats in order. And among them with goodwill spake  Aeson's son:    (ll. 332-340) \"All the equipment that a ship needs for all is in due  order--lies ready for our departure. Therefore we will make no long  delay in our sailing for these things' sake, when the breezes but  blow fair. But, friends,--for common to all is our return to Hellas  hereafter, and common to all is our path to the land of Aeetes--now  therefore with ungrudging heart choose the bravest to be our leader,  who shall be careful for everything, to take upon him our quarrels and  covenants with strangers.\"    (ll. 341-344) Thus he spake; and the young heroes turned their eyes  towards bold Heracles sitting in their midst, and with one shout they  all enjoined upon him to be their leader; but he, from the place where  he sat, stretched forth his right hand and said:    (ll. 345-347) \"Let no one offer this honour to me. For I will not  consent, and I will forbid any other to stand up. Let the hero who  brought us together, himself be the leader of the host.\"    (ll. 348-350) Thus he spake with high thoughts, and they assented,"]]]
