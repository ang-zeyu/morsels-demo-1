Volume 10, No. 263, (#3)"],[1," being devoted to the scientific pursuits of his  profession, left little time or inclination for other studies.    Though of Italian origin, Bonaparte had not a decided taste for the fine  arts, and his taste in composition seems to have leaned towards the  grotesque and the bombastic. He used always the most exaggerated  phrases; and it is seldom, if ever, that his bulletins present those  touches of sublimity which are founded on dignity and simplicity of  expression.    Notwithstanding the external calmness and reserve of his deportment, he  who was destined for such great things had, while yet a student at  Brienne, a full share of that ambition for distinction and dread of  disgrace, that restless and irritating love of fame, which is the spur  to extraordinary attempts. Sparkles of this keen temper sometimes showed  themselves. On one occasion, a harsh superintendant imposed on the  future emperor, for some trifling fault, the disgrace of wearing a  penitential dress, and being excluded from the table of the students,  and obliged to eat his meal apart. His pride felt the indignity so  severely, that it brought on a severe nervous attack; to which, though  otherwise of good constitution, he was subject upon occasions of  extraordinary irritation. Father Petrault, the professor of mathematics,  hastened to deliver his favourite pupil from the punishment by which he  was so much affected.    It is also said that an early disposition to the popular side  distinguished Bonaparte even when at Brienne. Pichegru, afterwards so  celebrated, who acted as his monitor in the military school, (a singular  circumstance,) bore witness to his early principles, and to the peculiar  energy and tenacity of his temper. He was long afterwards consulted  whether means might not be found to engage the commander of the Italian  armies in the royal interest. \"It will be but lost time to attempt it,\"  said Pichegru. \"I knew him in his youth--his character is inflexible--he  has taken his side, and he will not change it.\"    In 1783, Napoleon Bonaparte, then only fourteen years old, was, though  under the usual age, selected by Monsieur de Keralio, the inspector of  the twelve military schools, to be sent to have his education completed  in the general school of Paris. It was a compliment paid to the  precocity of his extraordinary mathematical talent, and the steadiness  of his application. While at Paris he attracted the same notice as at  Brienne; and among other society, frequented that of the celebrated Abbe  Raynal, and was admitted to his literary parties. His taste did not  become correct, but his appetite for study in all departments was  greatly enlarged; and notwithstanding the quantity which he daily read,  his memory was strong enough to retain, and his judgment sufficiently  ripe to arrange and digest, the knowledge which he then acquired; so  that he had it at his command during all the rest of his busy life.  Plutarch was his favourite author; upon the study of whom he had so  modelled his opinions and habits of thought, that Paoli afterwards  pronounced him a young man of an antique caste, and resembling one of  the classical heroes.    Some of his biographers have about this time ascribed to him the  anecdote of a certain youthful pupil of the military school, who desired  to ascend in the car of a balloon with the aeronaut Blanchard, and was  so mortified at being refused, that he made an attempt to cut the  balloon with his sword. The story has but a flimsy support, and indeed  does not accord well with the character of the hero, which was deep and  reflective, as well as bold and determined, and not likely to suffer its  energies to escape in idle and useless adventure.    A better authenticated anecdote states, that at this time he expressed  himself disrespectfully towards the king in one of his letters to his  family. According to the practice of the school, he was obliged to  submit the letter to the censorship of Monsieur Domairon, the professor  of belles lettres, who, taking notice of the offensive passage, insisted  upon the letter being burnt, and added a severe rebuke. Long afterwards,  in 1802, Monsieur Domairon was commanded to attend Napoleon's levee, in  order that he might receive a pupil in the person of Jerome Bonaparte,  when the first consul reminded his old tutor good-humouredly, that times  had changed considerably since the burning of the letter.    Napoleon Bonaparte, in his seventieth year, received his first  commission as second lieutenant in a regiment of artillery, and was  almost immediately afterwards promoted to the rank of first lieutenant  in the corps quartered at Valence. He mingled with society when he  joined his regiment, more than he had hitherto been accustomed to do;  mixed in public amusements, and exhibited the powers of pleasing, which  he possessed in an uncommon degree when he chose to exert them. His  handsome and intelligent features, with his active and neat, though  slight figure, gave him additional advantages. His manners could  scarcely be called elegant, but made up in vivacity and variety of  expression, and often in great spirit and energy, for what they wanted  in grace and polish.    He became an adventurer for the honours of literature also, and was  anonymously a competitor for the prize offered by the Academy of Lyons  on Raynal's question, \"What are the principles and institutions, by  application of which mankind can be raised to the highest pitch of  happiness?\" The prize was adjudged to the young soldier. It is  impossible to avoid feeling curiosity to know the character of the  juvenile theories respecting government, advocated by one who at length  attained the power of practically making what experiments he pleased.  Probably his early ideas did not exactly coincide with his more mature  practice; for when Talleyrand, many years afterwards, got the essay out  of the records of the academy, and returned it to the author, Bonaparte  destroyed it after he had read a few pages. He also laboured under the  temptation of writing a journey to Mount Cenis, after the manner of  Sterne, which he was fortunate enough finally to resist. The affectation  which pervades Sterne's peculiar style of composition was not likely to  be simplified under the pen of Bonaparte.    Sterner times were fast approaching, and the nation was now fully  divided by those factions which produced the revolution. The officers of  Bonaparte's regiment were also divided into royalists and patriots; and  it is easily to be imagined, that the young and friendless stranger and  adventurer should adopt that side to which he had already shown some  inclination, and which promised to open the most free career to those  who had only their merit to rely on. \"Were I a general officer,\" he is  alleged to have said, \"I would have adhered to the king; being a  subaltern, I join the patriots.\"    There was a story current, that in a debate with some brother officers  on the politics of the time, Bonaparte expressed himself so  outrageously, that they were provoked to throw him into the Rhone, where  he had nearly perished. But this is an inaccurate account of the  accident which actually befell him. He was seized with the cramp when  bathing in the river. His comrades saved him with difficulty, but his  danger was matter of pure chance.    Napoleon has himself recorded that he was a warm patriot during the  whole sitting of the National Assembly; but that on the appointment of  the Legislative Assembly, he became shaken in his opinions. If so, his  original sentiments regained force, for we shortly afterwards find him  entertaining such as went to the extreme heights of the revolution.    Early in the year 1792, Bonaparte became a captain in the artillery by  seniority; and in the same year, being at Paris, he witnessed the two  insurrections of the 20th of June and 10th of August. He was accustomed  to speak of the insurgents as the most despicable banditti, and to  express with what ease a determined officer could have checked these  apparently formidable, but dastardly and unwieldy masses. But with what  a different feeling of interest would Napoleon have looked on that  infuriated populace, those still resisting though overpowered Swiss, and  that burning palace, had any seer whispered to him, \"Emperor that shall  be, all this blood and massacre is but to prepare your future empire!\"  Little anticipating the potent effect which the passing events were to  bear on his own fortune, Bonaparte, anxious for the safety of his mother  and family, was now desirous to change France for Corsica, where the  same things were acting on a less distinguished stage.      BONAPARTE'S FIRST MILITARY EXPLOIT.    Napoleon's first military exploit was in the civil war of his native  island. In the year 1793, he was despatched from Bastia, in possession  of the French party, to surprise his native town Ajaccio, then occupied  by Paoli or his adherents. Bonaparte was acting provisionally, as  commanding a battalion of National Guards. He landed in the Gulf of  Ajaccio with about fifty men, to take possession of a tower called the  Torre di Capitello, on the opposite side of the gulf, and almost facing  the city. He succeeded in taking the place; but as there arose a gale of  wind which prevented his communicating with the frigate which had put  him ashore, he was besieged in his new conquest by the opposite faction,  and reduced to such distress, that he and his little garrison were  obliged to feed on horse-flesh. After five days he was relieved by the  frigate, and evacuated the tower, having first in vain attempted to blow  it up. The Torre di Capitello still shows marks of the damage it then  sustained, and its remains may be looked on as a curiosity, as the first  scene of _his_ combats, before whom        --\"Temple and tower      Went to the ground.--\"    A relation of Napoleon, Masserio by name,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#3)"],[1,"not exhaust the story, however. In another part of the legend, to  which, again, Zabara offers parallels, Solomon, being out hunting, comes  suddenly on Marcolf's hut, and, calling upon him, receives a number of  riddling answers, which completely foil him, and tor the solution of which  he is compelled to have recourse to the proposer. He departs, however, in  good humor, desiring Marcolf to come to court the next day and bring a pail  of fresh milk and curds from the cow. Marcolf fails, and the king condemns  him to sit up all night in his company, threatening him with death in the  morning, should he fall asleep. This, of course, Marcolf does immediately,  and he snores aloud. Solomon asks, \"Sleepest thou?\"--And Marcolf replies,  \"No, I think.\"--\"What thinkest thou?\"--\"That there are as many vertebrae in  the hare's tail as in his backbone.\"--The king, assured that he has now  entrapped his adversary, replies: \"If thou provest not this, thou diest in  the morning!\" Over and over again Marcolf snores, and is awakened by  Solomon, but he is always _thinking_. He gives various answers during the  night: There are as many white feathers as black in the magpie.--There is  nothing whiter than daylight, daylight is whiter than milk.--Nothing can be  safely entrusted to a woman.--Nature is stronger than education.    Next day Marcolf proves all his statements. Thus, he places a pan of milk  in a dark closet, and suddenly calls the king. Solomon steps into the milk,  splashes himself, and nearly falls. \"Son of perdition! what does this  mean?\" roars the monarch. \"May it please Your Majesty,\" says Marcolf,  \"merely to show you that milk is not whiter than daylight.\" That nature is  stronger than education, Marcolf proves by throwing three mice, one after  the other, before a cat trained to hold a lighted candle in its paws during  the king's supper; the cat drops the taper, and chases the mice. Marcolf  further enters into a bitter abuse of womankind, and ends by inducing  Solomon himself to join in the diatribe. When the king perceives the trick,  he turns Marcolf out of court, and eventually orders him to be hanged. One  favor is granted to him: he may select his own tree. Marcolf and his guards  traverse the valley of Jehoshaphat, pass to Jericho over Jordan, through  Arabia and the Red Sea, but \"never more could Marcolf find a tree that he  would choose to hang on.\" By this device, Marcolf escapes from Solomon's  hands, returns home, and passes the rest of his days in peace.    The legend, no doubt Oriental in origin, enjoyed popularity in the Middle  Ages largely because it became the frame into which could be placed  collections of proverbial lore. Hence, as happened also with the legend of  the Queen of Sheba and her riddles, the versions vary considerably as to  the actual content of the questions and answers bandied between Solomon and  Marcolf. In the German and English versions, the proverbs and wisdom are  largely Teutonic; in Zabara they are Oriental, and, in particular, Arabic.  Again, Marcolf in the French version of Mauclerc is much more completely  the reviler of woman. Mauclerc wrote almost contemporaneously with Zabara  (about 1216-1220, according to Kemble). But, on the other hand, Mauclerc  has no story, and his Marcolf is a punning clown rather than a cunning  sage. Marcolf, who is Solomon's brother in a German version, has no trust  in a woman even when dead. So, in another version, Marcolf is at once  supernaturally cunning, and extremely skeptical as to the morality and  constancy of woman. But it is unnecessary to enter into the problem more  closely. Suffice it to have established that in Zabara's \"Book of Delight\"  we have a hitherto unsuspected adaptation of the Solomon-Marcolf legend.  Zabara handles the legend with rare originality, and even ventures to cast  himself for the title role in place of the wisest of kings.    In the summary of the book which follows, the rhymed prose of the original  Hebrew is reproduced only in one case. This form of poetry is unsuited to  the English language. What may have a strikingly pleasing effect in  Oriental speech, becomes, in English, indistinguishable from doggerel. I  have not translated at full length, but I have endeavored to render Zabara  accurately, without introducing thoughts foreign to him.    I have not thought it necessary to give elaborate parallels to Zabara's  stories, nor to compare minutely the various details of the Marcolf legend  with Zabara's poem. On the whole, it may be said that the parallel is  general rather than specific. I am greatly mistaken, however, if the  collection of stories that follows does not prove of considerable interest  to those engaged in the tracking of fables to their native lairs. Here, in  Zabara, we have an earlier instance than was previously known in Europe, of  an intertwined series of fables and witticisms, partly Indian, partly  Greek, partly Semitic, in origin, welded together by the Hebrew poet by  means of a framework. The use of the framework by a writer in Europe in the  year 1200 is itself noteworthy. And when it is remembered what the  framework is, it becomes obvious that the \"Book of Delight\" occupies a  unique position in medieval literature.      THE GIANT GUEST      Once on a night, I, Joseph, lay upon my bed; sleep was sweet upon me, my    one return for all my toil. Things there are which weary the soul and    rest the body, others that weary the body and rest the soul, but sleep    brings calm to the body and the soul at once.... While I slept, I dreamt;    and a gigantic but manlike figure appeared before me, rousing me from my    slumber. \"Arise, thou sleeper, rouse thyself and see the wine while it is    red; come, sit thee down and eat of what I provide.\" It was dawn when I    hastily rose, and I saw before me wine, bread, and viands; and in the    man's hand was a lighted lamp, which cast a glare into every corner. I    said, \"What are these, my master?\" \"My wine, my bread, my viands; come,    eat and drink with me, for I love thee as one of my mother's sons.\" And I    thanked him, but protested: \"I cannot eat or drink till I have prayed to    the Orderer of all my ways; for Moses, the choice of the prophets, and    the head of those called, hath ordained, 'Eat not with the blood';    therefore no son of Israel will eat until he prays for his soul, for the    blood is the soul....\"      Then said he, \"Pray, if such be thy wish\"; and I bathed my hands and    face, and prayed. Then I ate of all that was before me, for my soul loved    him.... Wine I would not drink, though he pressed me sore. \"Wine,\" I    said, \"blindeth the eyes, robbeth the old of wisdom and the body of    strength, it revealeth the secrets of friends, and raiseth dissension    between brothers.\" The man's anger was roused. \"Why blasphemest thou    against wine, and bearest false witness against it? Wine bringeth joy;    sorrow and sighing fly before it. It strengtheneth the body, maketh the    heart generous, prolongeth pleasure, and deferreth age; faces it maketh    shine, and the senses it maketh bright.\"      \"Agreed, but let thy servant take the water first, as the ancient    physicians advise; later I will take the wine, a little, without water.\"      When I had eaten and drunk with him, I asked for his name and his    purpose. \"I come,\" said he, \"from a distant land, from pleasant and    fruitful hills, my wisdom is as thine, my laws as thine, my name Enan    Hanatash, the son of Arnan ha-Desh.\" I was amazed at the name, unlike any    I had ever heard. \"Come with me from this land, and I will tell thee all    my secret lore; leave this spot, for they know not here thy worth and thy    wisdom. I will take thee to another place, pleasant as a garden, peopled    by loving men, wise above all others.\" But I answered: \"My lord, I cannot    go. Here are many wise and friendly; while I live, they bear me on the    wing of their love; when I die, they will make my death sweet.... I fear    thee for thy long limbs, and in thy face I see, clear-cut, the marks of    unworthiness; I fear thee, and I will not be thy companion, lest there    befall me what befell the leopard with the fox.\" And I told him the    story.    In this manner, illustrative tales are introduced throughout the poem.  Zabara displays rare ingenuity in fitting the illustrations into his  framework. He proceeds:      THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD      A leopard once lived in content and plenty; ever he found easy sustenance    for his wife and children. Hard by there dwelt his neighbor and friend,    the fox. The fox felt in his heart that his life was safe only so long as    the leopard could catch other prey, and he planned out a method for    ridding himself of this dangerous friendship. Before the evil cometh, say    the wise, counsel is good. \"Let me move him hence,\" thought the fox; \"I    will lead him to the paths of death; for the sages say, 'If one come to    slay thee, be beforehand with him, and slay him instead.'\" Next day the    fox went to the leopard, and told him of a spot he had seen, a spot of    gardens and lilies, where fawns and does disported themselves, and    everything was fair. The leopard went with him to behold this paradise,    and rejoiced with exceeding joy. \"Ah,\" thought the fox, \"many a smile    ends in a tear.\" But the leopard was charmed, and wished to move to this    delightful abode; \"but, first,\" said he, \"I will go to consult my wife,    my lifelong comrade, the bride of my youth.\" The fox was sadly    disconcerted. Full well he knew the wisdom and the craft of the leopard's    wife. \"Nay,\" said he, \"trust not thy wife. A woman's counsel is evil and    foolish, her heart hard like marble; she is a plague in a house. Yes, ask    her advice, and do the opposite.\".... The leopard told his wife that he    was resolved to go. \"Beware of the fox,\" she exclaimed; \"two small    animals there are, the craftiest"]]]
