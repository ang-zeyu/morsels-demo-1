Will you go to  South America with me?\"    \"Whereabout in South America are you going, Mr. Damon, and why?\" Tom  asked.    \"To Peru, Tom.\"    \"What a coincidence!\" exclaimed Mr. Titus.    \"I beg your pardon?\" said Mr. Damon, interrogatively.    \"I said what a coincidence. I am going there myself.\"    \"Excuse me,\" interposed Tom, \"I don't believe, in the excitement of the  moment, I introduced you gentlemen. Allow me--Mr. Damon--Mr. Titus.\"    The presentation over, Mr. Damon went on:    \"You see, Tom, I have lately invested considerable money in a wholesale  drug concern. We deal largely in Peruvian remedies, principally the  bark of the cinchona tree, from which quinine is made. Of late there  has been some trouble over our concession from the Peruvian government,  and the company has decided to send me down there to investigate.    \"Of course, as soon as I made up my mind to go I thought of you. So I  came over to see if you would not accompany me.  All went well until I  reached your front gate. Then my horse became frightened by a yellow  toy balloon some boy was blowing up in the street and bolted with me. I  suppose if it had been a red or green balloon the effect would have  been the same. However, here I am, somewhat the worse for wear.  Now  Tom, what do you say? Will you go to South America--to Peru--with me,  and help look up this Quinine business?\"    Once more Mr. Titus and Tom looked at each other.          Chapter III    A Face at the Window      \"What is the matter?\" asked Mr. Damon, catching the glance between Tom  and the contractor. \"Is there anything wrong with South America--Peru?  I know they have lots of revolutions in those countries, but I don't  believe Peru is what they call a 'banana republic'; is it?\"    \"No,\" and Mr. Titus shook his head. \"It isn't a question of  revolutions.\"    \"But it's something!\" insisted Mr. Damon. \"Bless my ink bottle! but  it's something. As soon as I mention Peru, Tom, you and Mr. Titus eye  each other as if I'd said something dreadful. Out with it! What is it?\"    \"It's just--just a coincidence,\" Tom said. \"But go on, Mr. Damon.  Finish what you have to say and then we'll explain.\"    \"Well, I guess I've told you all you need to know for the present. I  went into this wholesale drug concern, hoping to make some money, but  now, on account of the trouble down in Peru, we stand to lose  considerable unless I can get back the cinchona concession.\"    \"What does that mean?\" Tom asked.    \"Well, it means that our concern secured from the Peruvian government  the right to take this quinine-producing bark from the trees in a  certain tropical section. But there has been a change in the government  in the district where our men were working, and now the privilege, or  concession, has been withdrawn. I'm going down to see if I can't get it  back. And I want you to go with me.\"    \"And I came here for very nearly the same thing,\" went on Mr. Titus.  \"That is where the coincidence comes in. It is strange that we should  both appeal to Mr. Swift at the same time.\"    \"Well, Tom's a valuable helper!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I know him of  old, for I've been on many a trip with him.\"    \"This is the first time I have had the pleasure of meeting him,\"  resumed the tunnel contractor, \"but I have heard of him. I did not ask  him to go to South America for us. I only wanted to get some superior  explosive for my brother, who is in charge of driving the railroad  tunnel through a spur of the Andes. I look after matters up North here,  but I may have to go to Peru myself.    \"As I told Mr. Swift, I had read of his invention of the giant cannon  and the special powder he used in it to send a projectile such a  distance. The cannon is now mounted as one of the pieces of ordnance  for the defense of the Panama Canal, is it not?\" he asked Tom.    The young inventor nodded in assent.    \"Having heard of you, and the wonderful explosive used in your big  cannon,\" the contractor went on, \"I wrote to my brother that I would  try and get some for him.    \"You see,\" he resumed, \"this is the situation. Back in the Andes  Mountains, a couple of hundred miles east of Lima, the government is  building a short railroad line to connect two others. If this is done  it will mean that the products of Peru--quinine bark, coffee, cocoa,  sugar, rubber, incense and gold can more easily be transported. But to  connect the two railroad lines a big tunnel must be constructed.    \"My brother and I make a specialty of such work, and when we saw bids  advertised for, our firm put in an estimate.  There was some trouble  with a rival firm, which also bid, but we secured the contract, and  bound ourselves to have the tunnel finished within a certain time, or  forfeit a large sum.    \"That was over a year ago. Since then our men, aided by the native  Indians of Peru, have been tunneling the mountain, until, about a month  back, we struck a snag.\"    \"What sort of snag?\" Tom asked.    \"A snag in the shape of extra hard rock,\" replied the tunnel  contractor. \"Briefly, Paleozoic rocks make up the eastern part of the  Andean Mountains in Peru, while the western range is formed of Mesozoic  beds, volcanic ashes and lava of comparatively recent date. Near the  coast the lower hills are composed of crystalline rocks, syenite and  granite, with, here and there, a strata of sandstone or limestone.  These are, undoubtedly, relics of the lower Cretaceous age, and we, or  rather, my brother, states that he has found them covered with marine  Tertiary deposits.    \"Now this Mesozoic band varies greatly. Porphyritic tuffs and massive  limestone compose the western chain of the Andes above Lima, while in  the Oroya Valley we find carbonaceous sandstones. Some of the tuffs may  be of the Jurassic age, though the Cretaceous period is also largely  represented.    \"Now while these different masses of rock formation offer hard enough  problems to the tunnel digger, still we are more or less prepared to  meet them, and we figured on a certain percentage of them. Up to the  present time we have met with just about what we expected, but what we  did not expect was something we came upon when the tunnel had been  driven three miles into the mountain.\"    \"What did you find?\" asked Tom, who knew enough about geology to  understand the terms used. Mr. Damon did not, however, and when Mr.  Titus rolled off some of the technical words, the drug investor softly  murmured such expressions as    \"Bless my thermometer! Bless my porous plaster!\"    \"We found,\" resumed Mr. Titus, \"after we had bored for a considerable  distance into the mountain, a mass of volcanic rock which is so hard  that our best diamond drills are dulled in a short time, and the  explosives we use merely shatter the face of the cutting, and give us  hardly any progress at all.    \"It was after several trials, and when my brother found that he was  making scarcely any progress, compared to the energy of his men and the  blasting, that he wrote to me, explaining matters. I at once thought of  you, Tom Swift, and your powerful explosive, for I had read about it.    \"Now then, will you sell us some of your powder--explosive or whatever  you call it--Mr. Swift, or tell us where we can get it? We need it  soon, for we are losing valuable time.\"    Mr. Titus paused to draw on a piece of paper a rough map of Peru, and  the district where the tunnel was being constructed. He showed where  the two railroad lines were, and where the new route would bring them  together, the tunnel eliminating a big grade up which it would have  been impossible to haul trains of any weight.    \"What do you say, Mr. Swift?\" the contractor concluded.  \"Will you let  us have some of your powder? Or, better still, will you come to Peru  yourself? That would suit us immensely, for you could be right on the  ground. And you could carry out your plan of going with your friend  here,\" and Mr. Titus nodded toward Mr. Damon. \"That is, if you were  thinking of going.\"    \"Well, I was thinking of it,\" Tom admitted. \"Mr. Damon and I have been  on so many trips together that it seems sort of natural for us to 'team  it.' I have never been to Peru, and I should like to see the country.  There is only one matter though, that bothers me.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Mr. Titus quickly. \"If it is a question of money  dismiss it from your mind. The Peruvian government is paying a large  sum for this tunnel, and we stand to make considerable, even if we were  the lowest bidders. We can afford to pay you well--that is, we shall be  able to if we can complete the bore on time. That is what is bothering  me now--the unexpected strata of hard rock we have met with, which  seems impossible to blast. But I feel sure we can do it with the  explosive used in your giant cannon.\"    \"That is just the point!\" Tom exclaimed. \"I am not so sure my explosive  would do.\"    \"Why not?\" the tunnel contractor asked. \"It's powerful enough; isn't  it?\"    \"Yes, it is powerful enough, but whether it will have the right effect  on volcanic rock is hard to say. I should like to see a rock sample.\"    \"I can telegraph to have some sent here to you,\" said Mr. Titus  eagerly. \"Meantime, here is a description of it. I can read you that\";  and, taking a letter from his pocket, he read to Tom a geological  description of the hard rock.    \"Hum! Yes,\" mused Tom, as he listened. \"It seems to be of the nature of  obsidian.\"    \"Bless my watch chain!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What's that?\"    \"Obsidian is a volcanic rock--a sort of combination of glass and flint  for hardness,\" Tom explained. \"It is brittle, black in color, and the  natives of the Admiralty Islands use it for tipping their spears with  which they slay victims for their cannibalistic feasts.\"    \"Bless my--bless my ear-drums!\" gasped Mr. Damon.  \"Cannibals!\"    \"Obsidian was also used by the ancient Mexicans to make knives and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#3)"],[1," might do. Jove! if he really didn't know  who I was, and finds out, say! won't he be surprised?\"    \"Rather,\" agreed Mr Damon. \"Well, Tom, I had a nice little ride. And  now I must be getting back. But if you contemplate a trip anywhere,  don't forget to let me know.\"    \"I don't count on going anywhere soon,\" Tom answered. \"I have something  on hand that will occupy all my time, though I don't just like it.  However, I'm going to do my best,\" and he waved good-bye to Mr. Damon,  who went off blessing various parts of his anatomy or clothing, an odd  habit he had.    As Tom turned to go into the house, the unsettled look still on his  face, some one hailed him.    \"I say, Tom. Hello! Wait a minute! I've got something to show you!\"    \"Oh, hello, Ned Newton!\" Called back the young inventor.  \"Well, if  it's Liberty Bonds, you don't need to show me any, for dad and I will  buy all we can without seeing them.\"    \"I know that, Tom, and it was a dandy subscription you gave me. I  didn't come about that, though I may be around the next time Uncle Sam  wants the people to dig down in their socks. This is something  different,\" and Ned Newton, a young banker of Shopton and a lifelong  friend of Tom's, drew a paper from his pocket as he advanced across the  lawn.    \"There, Tom Swift!\" he cried, flipping out an illustrated page,  evidently from some illustrated newspaper. \"There's the very latest  from the other side. A London banker friend of mine sent it to me, and  it got past the censor all right.  It's the first authentic photograph  of the newest and biggest British tank. Isn't that a wonder?\"    Ned held up the paper which had in it a fullpage photograph of a  monster tank--those weird machines traveling on endless steel belts of  caterpillar construction, armored, riveted and plated, with machine  guns bristling here and there.    \"Isn't that great, Tom? Can you beat it? It's the most wonderful  machine of the age, even counting some of yours.  Can you beat it?\"    Tom took the paper indifferently, and his manner surprised his chum.    \"Well, what's the matter, Tom?\" asked Ned. \"Don't you think that great?  Why don't you say something? You don't mean to say you've seen that  picture before?\"    \"No, Ned.\"    \"Then what's the matter with you? Isn't that wonderful?\"          Chapter III    Ned is Worried      Tom Swift did not answer for several seconds. He stood holding the  paper Ned had given him, the sun slanting on the picture of the big  British tank. But the young inventor did not appear to see it. Instead,  his eyes were as though contemplating something afar off.    \"Well, this gets me!\" cried Ned, his voice showing impatience. \"Here I  go and get a picture of the latest machine the British armies are  smashing up the Boches with, and bring it to you fresh from the mail--I  even quit my Liberty Bond business to do it, and I know some dandy  prospects, too--and here you look at it like a--like a fish!\" burst out  Ned.    \"Say, old man, I guess that's right!\" admitted Tom. \"I wasn't thinking  about it, to tell you the truth.\"    \"Why not?\" Ned demanded. \"Isn't it great, Tom? Did you ever see  anything like it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You did?\" Cried Ned, in surprise. \"Where? Say, Tom Swift, are you  keeping something from me?\"    \"I mean no, Ned. I never have seen a British tank.\"    \"Well, did you ever see a picture like this before?\" Ned persisted.    \"No, not exactly like that But--\"    \"Well, what do you think of it?\" cried the young banker, who was giving  much of his time to selling bonds for the Government. \"Isn't it great?\"    Tom considered a moment before replying. Then he said slowly:    \"Well, yes, Ned, it is a pretty good machine. But--\"    \"'But!' Howling tomcats! Say, what's the 'matter with you, anyhow, Tom?  This is great! 'But!' 'But me no buts!' This is, without exception, the  greatest thing out since an airship. It will win the war for us and the  Allies, too, and don't you forget it! Fritz's barbed wire and dugouts  and machine gun emplacements can't stand for a minute against these  tanks! Why, Tom, they can crawl on their back as well as any other way,  and they don't mind a shower of shrapnel or a burst of machine gun  lead, any more than an alligator minds a swarm of gnats. The only thing  that makes 'em hesitate a bit is a Jack Johnson or a Bertha shell, and  it's got to be a pretty big one, and in the right place, to do much  damage. These tanks are great, and there's nothing like 'em.\"    \"Oh, yes there is, Ned!\"    \"There is!\" cried Ned. \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean there may be something like them--soon.\"    \"There may? Say, Tom--\"    \"Now don't ask me a lot of questions, Ned, for I can't answer them.  When I say there may be something like them, I mean it isn't beyond the  realms of possibility that some one--perhaps the Germans--may turn out  even bigger and better tanks.\"    \"Oh!\" And Ned's voice showed his disappointment. \"I thought maybe you  were in on that game yourself, Tom. Say, couldn't you get up something  almost as good as this?\" and he indicated the picture in the paper.  \"Isn't that wonderful?\"    \"Oh, well, it's good, Ned, but there are others. Yes, Dad, I'm coming,\"  he called, as he saw his father beckoning to him from a distant  building.    \"Well, I've got to get along,\" said Ned. \"But I certainly am  disappointed, Tom. I thought you'd go into a fit over this  picture--it's one of the first allowed to get out of England, my London  friend said. And instead of enthusing you're as cold as a clam;\" and  Ned shook his head in puzzled and disappointed fashion as he walked  slowly along beside the young inventor.    They passed a new building, one of the largest in the group of the many  comprising the Swift plant. Ned looked at the door which bore a notice  to the effect that no one was admitted unless bearing a special permit,  or accompanied by Mr. Swift or Tom.    \"What's this, Tom?\" asked Ned. \"Some new wrinkle?\"    \"Yes, an invention I'm working on. It isn't in shape yet to be seen.\"    \"It must be something big, Tom,\" observed Ned, as he viewed the large  building.    \"It is.\"    \"And say, what a whopping big fence you've got around the back yard!\"  went on the young banker. \"Looks like a baseball field, but it would  take some scrambling on the part of a back-lots kid to get over it.\"    \"That's what it's for--to keep people out.\"    \"I see! Well, I've got to get along. I'm a bit back in my day's quota  of selling Liberty Bonds, and I've got to hustle. I'm sorry I bothered  you about that tank picture, Tom.\"    \"Oh, it wasn't a bother--don't think that for a minute, Ned! I was glad  to see it.\"    \"Well, he didn't seem so, and his manner was certainly queer,\" mused  Ned, as he walked away, and turned in time to see Tom enter the new  building, which had such a high fence all around it. \"I never saw him  more indifferent. I wonder if Tom isn't interested in seeing Uncle Sam  help win this war?  That's the way it struck me. I thought surely Tom  would go up in the air, and say this was a dandy,\" and Ned unfolded the  paper and took another look at the British tank photograph. \"If there's  anything can beat that I'd like to see it,\" he mused.    \"But I suppose Tom has discovered some new kind of air stabilizer, or a  different kind of carburetor that will vaporize kerosene as well as  gasolene. If he has, why doesn't he offer it to Uncle Sam? I wonder if  Tom is pro-German?  No, of Course he can't be!\" and Ned laughed at his  own idea.    \"At the same time, it is queer,\" he mused on. \"There is something wrong  with Tom Swift.\"    Once more Ned looked at the picture. It was a representation of one of  the newest and largest of the British tanks. In appearance these are  not unlike great tanks, though they are neither round nor square, being  shaped, in fact, like two wedges with the broad ends put together, and  the sharper ends sticking out, though there is no sharpness to a tank,  the \"noses\" both being blunt.    Around each outer edge runs an endless belt of steel plates, hinged  together, with ridges at the joints, and these broad belts of steel  plates, like the platforms of some moving stairways used in department  stores, moving around, give motion to the tank.    Inside, well protected from the fire of enemy guns by steel plates, are  the engines for driving the belts, or caterpillar wheels, as they are  called. There is also the steering apparatus, and the guns that fire on  the enemy.  There are cramped living and sleeping quarters for the  tank's crew, more limited than those of a submarine.    The tank is ponderous, the smallest of them, which were those first  constructed, weighing forty-two tons, or about as much as a good-sized  railroad freight car. And it is this ponderosity, with its slow but  resistless movement, that gives the tank its power.    The tank, by means of the endless belts of steel plates, can travel  over the roughest country. It can butt into a tree, a stone wall, or a  house, knock over the obstruction, mount it, crawl over it, and slide  down into a hole on the other side and crawl out again, on the level,  or at an angle. Even if overturned, the tanks can sometimes right  themselves and keep on. At the rear are trailer wheels, partly used in  steering and partly for reaching over gaps or getting out of holes. The  tanks can turn in their own length, by moving one belt in one direction  and the other oppositely.    Inside there is nothing much but machinery of the gasolene type, and  the machine guns. The tank is closed except for small openings out of  which the guns project, and slots through which the men inside look out  to guide themselves or direct their fire.    Such, in brief, is a British tank, one of the most powerful and  effective weapons yet loosed against the Germans. They are useful in  tearing down the barbed-wire entanglements on the Boche side of No  Man's Land, and they can clear the way up to and past the"]]]
