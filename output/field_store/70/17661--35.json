L'IRLANDAIS ET LE CABLE    Au moment ou un vapeur allait partir, un Irlandais de l'equipage  recut l'ordre de haler un long cable qui trainait a l'arriere.  Il se mit gaiment a l'oeuvre, mais l'excessive longueur du cable  epuisa bientot sa patience. \"Je voudrais savoir, dit-il, qu'est  devenu l'autre bout de ce cable: quelque requin l'aura sans doute  mange.\"      Quel ordre l'Irlandais a-t-il recu?--S'est-il mis a l'oeuvre?--Le  cable etait-il long ou non?--Qu'est-ce que le marin s'est demande?      15. LA VENGEANCE    Un favori du sultan jeta une pierre a un pauvre derviche qui  lui avait demande l'aumone. Le derviche n'osa rien dire; mais  il ramassa la pierre et la mit dans sa poche, esperant que cette  pierre lui servirait a se venger, si l'occasion se presentait.  Quelques jours apres il entendit un grand tumulte dans la rue, et  il s'informa de ce qui le causait. Il apprit que le favori etait  tombe en disgrace, et que le sultan le faisait conduire dans les  rues de la ville attache sur un chameau et livre aux insultes  du peuple. A l'instant le derviche tira sa pierre de sa poche,  mais ce fut pour la lancer loin de lui. \"Je sens, s'ecria-t-il,  que la vengeance n'est jamais permise; car si notre ennemi est  puissant, elle est imprudente et insensee; si au contraire il  est malheureux, elle est lache et cruelle.\"      Pourquoi le favori a-t-il jete la pierre?--Est-ce que le derviche  l'a ramassee?--Ou est-ce qu'il l'a mise?--Dans quel but?--Qu'est-ce  qu'il a entendu un peu plus tard?--Qu'a-t-il appris?--Est-ce  qu'il s'est souvenu de la pierre?--Pourquoi ne voulait-il pas  s'en servir?

UN DUPEUR DUPE    On conte que le celebre general romain Marc-Antoine se livrait  quelquefois au divertissement de la peche a la ligne avec la reine  d'Egypte, Cleopatre. La reine etait fort adroite; le general avait  la main lourde: il n'attrappait jamais le plus petit poisson, et  Cleopatre se moquait de lui. Voici, pour suppleer a sa maladresse,  le stratageme qu'il s'imagina. Il connaissait un excellent plongeur.  Il indiqua une peche pour un certain jour, remit a ce plongeur un  lot de poissons magnifiques, qu'il avait fait d'avance mettre  en reserve, et lui commanda de venir sous l'eau attacher  successivement chaque poisson au bout de sa ligne. Le plongeur  reussit, et Antoine eut ainsi, sans aucune peine, les honneurs  de la journee. Mais Cleopatre etait fine: elle devina la ruse  et s'en vengea bientot.    Le jour de la peche revint; Antoine jeta sa ligne. Il l'avait  a peine lancee dans l'eau qu'il sentit une violente secousse.  Le fidele plongeur se trouve a son poste; Antoine le sait: le  succes est done sur. Il tire. Et que trouve-t-il a son hamecon?  Un poisson qui sort de la poele, tout pret a etre mange! La reine  l'avait fait attacher a la ligne d'Antoine par un autre plongeur  encore plus diligent que celui du general.    On se represente aisement la triste mine du pecheur dupe et les  moqueries impitoyables qui accueillirent son etrange capture.

CHACUN SE BAT POUR CE QU'IL N'A PAS    Napoleon n'avait encore que vingt ans, lorsqu'un officier russe  lui dit avec beaucoup de suffisance, que les Russes se battaient  pour la gloire, et que les Francais ne se battaient que pour  l'argent. \"Vous avez parfaitement raison, repliqua Napoleon, car  chacun se bat pour ce qu'il n'a pas.\"      Quel age Napoleon avait-il lorsqu'il a eu cet entretien avec  l'officier russe?--Quelle difference le Russe voyait-il "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11758"],[0,"Baldy of Nome (#4)"],[1,"from shore]    And so it is not strange that in such a land where the dog has ever  played well his role of support to those who have faced its dangers and  conquered its terrors, that his importance should be at last freely  acknowledged, and the fact admitted that only the best possible dogs  should be used for all arduous tasks.    Toward this end the Nome Kennel Club was organized. The object was not  alone the improvement of the breeds used so extensively, but also, since  the first President was a Kentuckian, of equal importance was the  furnishing of a wholesome and characteristic sport for the community.    And Nome, once famed for her eager, reckless treasure-seekers in that  great rush of 1900; famed once for being the \"widest open\" camp in all  Alaska, now in her days of peace and quiet still claims recognition. Not  only because of the millions taken out annually by her huge dredgers and  hydraulics; not only because she is an important trading station that  supplies whalers and explorers with all necessary equipment for their  voyages in the Arctic; not only because of her picturesque history; but  because she possesses the best sled dogs to be found, and originated and  maintains the most thrilling and most difficult sport the world has ever  known--Long Distance Dog Racing.    Previous to the advent of these races any dog that could stand on four  legs, and had strength enough to pull, was apt to be pressed into  service; but since they have become a recognized feature of the life  there, a certain pride has manifested itself in the dog-drivers, and  dog-owners, who aim now to use only the dogs really fitted for the work.  Even the Eskimos, who were notorious for their indifferent handling of  their ill-fed, overburdened beasts, have joined in the \"better dog\"  movement, which is a popular and growing one.    According to Dubby's stern law, however, most of the Racers--the  long-legged, supple-bodied Tolmans, the delicately built Irish Setters,  Irish and Rover, and numberless others of the same type, would have been  condemned to the ignominy of being mere pets; useless canine adjuncts to  human beings--creatures that were allowed in the house, and were given  strangely repulsive bits of food in return for degrading antics, such as  sitting on one's hind legs or playing dead.    Occasionally there was, for some valid reason, an exception to his  disapproval; as in the case, for instance, of Jack McMillan. For while  he could not but deplore Jack's headstrong ways, and his intolerance of  authority in the past, he nevertheless felt a certain admiration for the  big tawny dog who moved with the lithe ease of the panther, and held  himself with the imposing dignity of the lion. An admiration for the dog  whose reputation for wickedness extended even to the point of being  called a \"man-eater,\" and was the source, far and near, of a respect  largely tempered with fear.    There was always an air of repressed pride about Jack when he listened  to the thrilling accounts of his crimes told with dramatic inspiration  to horrified audiences; a pride which is not seemly save for great  worth and good deeds. Yet in spite of these grave faults of character  Dubby accorded McMillan the recognition due his wonderful strength and  keen intelligence; for Dubby, while intolerant of mere speed, was ever  alert to find the sterner and more rugged qualities in his associates.    Perhaps it was partly because Baldy possessed no trivial graces and  manifested no disdain for the homely virtues of the work dogs whose  faithfulness has won for them an honorable place in the community, that  Dubby had soon given unmistakable signs of friendliness that helped to  make Baldy's new home endurable.    While Dubby's championship was a great comfort, there were many things  of every-day occurrence that surprised and annoyed Baldy. Out of the  bewilderment that had at first overwhelmed him he had finally evolved  two Great Rules of Conduct, which he observed implicitly--to Pull as  Hard as he Could, and to Obey his Driver. This code of ethics is perfect  for a trail dog of Alaska, but it was in the minor things that he was  constantly perplexed--things in which it was difficult to distinguish  between right and wrong, or at least between folly and wisdom. To tell  where frankness of action became tactlessness, and the renunciation of  passing pleasures a pose. It was particularly disconcerting to see that  virtue often remained unnoticed, and that vice just as often escaped  retribution; and what he saw might have undermined Baldy's whole moral  nature, but for the simple sincerity that was the key-note to his  character. As an artless dog of nature he was accustomed, when the world  did not seem just and right to him, to show it plainly--an attitude not  conducive to popularity; and it often made him seem surly when as a  matter of fact he was only puzzled or depressed. He could not feign an  amiability to hide hatred and vindictiveness as did the Tolmans, and it  was a constant shock to him to note how the hypocrisy of Tom and his  brothers deluded their friends into a deep-seated belief in their  integrity. Even after such depravity as chasing the Allan girl's pet  cat, stealing a neighbor's dog-salmon, or attacking an inoffensive  Cocker Spaniel, he had seen Tom so meek and pensive that no one could  suspect him of wrong-doing who had not actually witnessed it; and he had  seen the Woman, when she _had_ actually witnessed it, become a sort of  accessory after the fact, and shield Tom from \"Scotty's\" just wrath,  which was extraordinary and confusing.    The confinement of a Kennel, too, no matter how commodious, was most  trying. Even the vigorous daily exercise was \"personally conducted\" by  Matt; and Baldy longed for the freedom that had been his when alone, or  preferably with the boy, he had roamed through the far stretches of rank  grass, tender willows, and sweet-smelling herbs in summer, or over the  wide, snowy plains in winter.    Then, later, the boy came to Baldy; and there were blissful periods when  he would lie with his head on Ben's lap; when the repressed enmity of  the haughty Tolmans, the cold indifference of the magnificent McMillan,  and even Matt's eternal vigilance were forgotten. Periods when his  companion's toil-hardened hands stroked the sleek sides and sinewy  flanks that no longer hinted of insufficient nourishment; and caressing  fingers lingered over the smooth and shining coat that had once been so  rough and ragged.    To see Baldy receiving the same care and consideration as his  stable-mates, who had won the plaudits of the world, justified the boy's  sacrifice; and in spite of his loneliness he always left Baldy with a  happy heart.    \"We'll show 'em some day we was worth while, won't we, Baldy?\" he would  whisper confidently; and Baldy's reply was sure to be a satisfactory wag  of his bobbed tail, signifying that he certainly intended to do his  best.    [Illustration]          III    The First Step    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER III    THE FIRST STEP      With the boy's more frequent visits Baldy's horizon began to widen  almost imperceptibly. He even looked forward to those moments when, with  George Allan and his friend Danny Kelly, Ben stood beside him discussing  his points and possibilities.    Up to the present his world had included but two friends--the boy and  Moose Jones. Annoyed and sometimes abused at the Camp, he had felt that  there was no real understanding between himself and most of those with  whom he came into association, and it had made him gloomy and  suspicious. Now he knew, with the intuition so often found in children  and animals, that George and Danny, as well as Ben, comprehended, at  least in part, the emotions he could not adequately express--gratitude  for kindness and a desire to please; and in return he endeavored to show  his appreciation of this understanding by shy overtures of friendliness.  He even licked George's hand one day--a caress heretofore reserved  exclusively for Ben Edwards--and he escorted Danny Kelly the full length  of the town to his home in the East End, much as he dreaded the confines  of the narrow city streets where he was brought into close contact with  strange people and strange dogs.    At Golconda, in his absorbing affection for the boy, he had more or less  ignored the others of his kind--they meant nothing to him. But now the  advantages of plenty of food and excellent care were almost offset by  his occasional contact with the quarrelsome dogs of the street, and his  constant companionship with the distinguished company into which he had  come reluctantly and in which he seemed so unwelcome.    In \"Scotty\" Baldy discerned a compelling personality to whom he rendered  willing allegiance and respect, as well as a dawning affection. And it  was with much gratification that he had heard occasionally after  inspection comments in a tone that contained no trace of regret at his  presence, even if it had as yet inspired no particular enthusiasm. To be  sure Allan found some merit in the least promising dogs as a rule, and  perhaps the faint praise he was beginning to bestow on Baldy had in it  more or less of the impersonal approval he gave to all dogs who did not  prove themselves hopelessly bad. But it seemed at least a step in the  right direction when \"Scotty\" had said, replying to criticism of the  Woman, \"No, he is certainly not fierce, and by no means so morose as he  looks. So far I must confess he's proving himself a pretty good sort.\"    Of course even the Woman, who admitted frankly that first impressions  counted much with her, knew that it was not always wise to judge by  appearances, for she had seen the successful development of the most  unlikely material. There was the case of Tom, Dick, and Harry. No one  would ever have supposed in seeing them, so alert and with the quickness  and "]]]
