When our magnificent battleship Maine was sunk in Havana harbor,  February 15, 1898, the 25th U.S. Infantry was scattered in western  Montana, doing garrison duty, with headquarters at Fort Missoula. This  regiment had been stationed in the West since 1880, when it came up  from Texas where it had been from its consolidation in 1869, fighting  Indians, building roads, etc., for the pioneers of that state and New  Mexico. In consequence of the regiment's constant frontier service,  very little was known of it outside of army circles. As a matter of  course it was known that it was a colored regiment, but its praises  had never been sung.    Strange to say, although the record of this regiment was equal to any  in the service, it had always occupied remote stations, except a  short period, from about May, 1880, to about August, 1885, when  headquarters, band and a few companies were stationed at Fort  Snelling, near St. Paul, Minnesota.    [Illustration: SERGEANT FRANK W. PULLEN, Who was in the Charge on El  Caney, as a member of the Twenty-fifth U.S. Infantry.]    Since the days of reconstruction, when a great part of the country  (the South especially) saw the regular soldier in a low state of  discipline, and when the possession of a sound physique was the only  requirement necessary for the recruit to enter the service of the  United States, people in general had formed an opinion that the  regular soldier, generally, and the Negro soldier in particular, was  a most undesirable element to have in a community. Therefore, the  Secretary of War, in ordering changes in stations of troops from time  to time (as is customary to change troops from severe climates to  mild ones and _vice versa_, that equal justice might be done all) had  repeatedly overlooked the 25th Infantry; or had only ordered it from  Minnesota to the Dakotas and Montana, in the same military department,  and in a climate more severe for troops to serve in than any in the  United States. This gallant regiment of colored soldiers served  eighteen years in that climate, where, in winter, which lasts five  months or more, the temperature falls as low as 55 degrees below  zero, and in summer rises to over 100 degrees in the shade and where  mosquitos rival the Jersey breed.    Before Congress had reached a conclusion as to what should be done in  the Maine disaster, an order had been issued at headquarters of the  army directing the removal of the regiment to the department of the  South, one of the then recently organized departments.    At the time when the press of the country was urging a declaration of  war, and when Minister Woodford, at Madrid, was exhausting all the  arts of peace, in order that the United States might get prepared for  war, the men of the 25th Infantry were sitting around red-hot stoves,  in their comfortable quarters in Montana, discussing the doings of  Congress, impatient for a move against Spain. After great excitement  and what we looked upon as a long delay, a telegraphic order came. Not  for us to leave for the Department of the South, but to go to that  lonely sun-parched sandy island Dry Tortugas. In the face of the fact  that the order was for us to go to that isolated spot, where rebel  prisoners were carried and turned lose during the war of the  rebellion, being left there without guard, there being absolutely no  means of escape, and where it would have been necessary for our safety  to have kept Sampson's fleet in sight, the men received the news with  gladness and cheered as the order was read to them. The destination  was changed to Key West, Florida, then to Chickamauga Park, Georgia.  It seemed that the war department did not know what to do with the  soldiers at first.    Early Sunday morning, April 10, 1898, Easter Sunday, amidst tears of  lovers and others endeared by long acquaintance and kindness, and the  enthusiastic cheers of friends and well-wishers, the start was made  for Cuba.    It is a fact worthy of note that Easter services in all the churches  in Missoula, Montana, a town of over ten thousand inhabitants, was  postponed the morning of the departure of the 25th Infantry, and the  whole town turned out to bid us farewell. Never before were soldiers  more encouraged to go to war than we. Being the first regiment to  move, from the west, the papers had informed the people of our route.  At every station there was a throng of people who cheered as we  passed. Everywhere the Stars and Stripes could be seen. Everybody had  caught the war fever. We arrived at Chickamauga Park about April 15,  1898, being the first regiment to arrive at that place. We were  a curiosity. Thousands of people, both white and colored, from  Chattanooga, Tenn., visited us daily. Many of them had never seen a  colored soldier. The behavior of the men was such that even the  most prejudiced could find no fault. We underwent a short period of  acclimation at this place, then moved on to Tampa, Fla., where we  spent a month more of acclimation. All along the route from Missoula,  Montana, with the exception of one or two places in Georgia, we had  been received most cordially. But in Georgia, outside of the Park, it  mattered not if we were soldiers of the United States, and going to  fight for the honor of our country and the freedom of an oppressed and  starving people, we were \"niggers,\" as they called us, and treated  us with contempt. There was no enthusiasm nor Stars and Stripes in  Georgia. That is the kind of \"united country\" we saw in the South. I  must pass over the events and incidents of camp life at Chickamauga  and Tampa. Up to this time our trip had seemed more like a  Sunday-school excursion than anything else. But when, on June 6th, we  were ordered to divest ourselves of all clothing and equipage, except  such as was necessary to campaigning in a tropical climate, for the  first time the ghost of real warfare arose before us.    ON BOARD THE TRANSPORT.    The regiment went aboard the Government transport, No.  14--Concho--June 7, 1898. On the same vessel were the 14th U.S.  Infantry, a battalion of the 2d Massachusetts Volunteers and Brigade  Headquarters, aggregating about 1,300 soldiers, exclusive of the  officers. This was the beginning of real hardship. The transport had  either been a common freighter or a cattle ship. Whatever had been its  employment before being converted into a transport, I am sure of  one thing, it was neither fit for man nor beast when soldiers were  transported in it to Cuba. The actual carrying capacity of the vessel  as a transport was, in my opinion, about 900 soldiers, exclusive of  the officers, who, as a rule, surround themselves with every possible  comfort, even in actual warfare. A good many times, as on this  occasion, the desire and demand of the officers for comfort worked  serious hardships for the enlisted men. The lower decks had been  filled with bunks. Alas! the very thought of those things of torture  makes me shudder even now. They were arranged in rows, lengthwise the  ship, of course, with aisles only two feet wide between each row. The  dimensions of a man's bunk was 6 feet long, 2 feet wide and 2 feet  high, and they were arranged in tiers of four, with a four inch board  on either side to keep one from rolling out. The Government had  furnished no bedding at all. Our bedding consisted of one blanket as  mattress and haversack for pillow. The 25th Infantry was assigned to  the bottom deck, where there was no light, except the small port holes  when the gang-plank was closed. So dark was it that candles were  burned all day. There was no air except what came down the canvass air  shafts when they were turned to the breeze. The heat of that place was  almost unendurable. Still our Brigade Commander issued orders that no  one would be allowed to sleep on the main deck. That order was the  only one to my knowledge during the whole campaign that was not obeyed  by the colored soldiers. It is an unreported fact that a portion of  the deck upon which the 25th Infantry took passage to Cuba was flooded  with water during the entire journey.    Before leaving Port Tampa the Chief Surgeon of the expedition came  aboard and made an inspection, the result of which was the taking off  of the ship the volunteer battalion, leaving still on board about a  thousand men. Another noteworthy fact is that for seven days the boat  was tied to the wharf at Port Tampa, and we were not allowed to go  ashore, unless an officer would take a whole company off to bathe and  exercise. This was done, too, in plain sight of other vessels, the  commander of which gave their men the privilege of going ashore at  will for any purpose whatever. It is very easy to imagine the hardship  that was imposed upon us by withholding the privilege of going ashore,  when it is understood that there were no seats on the vessel for a  poor soldier. On the main deck there were a large number of seats,  but they were all reserved for the officers. A sentinel was posted on  either side of the ship near the middle hatch-way, and no soldier was  allowed to go abaft for any purpose, except to report to his superior  officer or on some other official duty.    Finally the 14th of June came. While bells were ringing, whistles  blowing and bands playing cheering strains of music the transports  formed \"in fleet in column of twos,\" and under convoy of some of the  best war craft of our navy, and while the thousands on shore waved us  godspeed, moved slowly down the bay on its mission to avenge the death  of the heroes of our gallant Maine and to free suffering Cuba.    The transports were scarcely out of sight of land when an order was  issued by our Brigade Commander directing that the two regiments on  board should not intermingle, and actually drawing the \"color line\" by  assigning the white regiment to the port and the 25th Infantry to the  starboard side "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11112"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13, No. 351, (#4)"],[1,"to have been dragged for miles through oceans  of mud; their clothes were torn, their caps and feathers cut to pieces,  and their shoes and boots trodden off. The accounts they brought were  vague and disheartening--in fact, we could only ascertain that the Duke  of Wellington had late on Saturday taken up his position at Waterloo,  and that there he meant to wait the attack of the French. That this  attack had commenced we needed not to be informed, as the roar of the  cannon became every instant more distinct, till we even fancied that it  shook the town. The wounded represented the field of battle as a perfect  quagmire, and their appearance testified the truth of their assertions.  About two o'clock a fresh alarm was excited by the horses, which had  been put in requisition to draw the baggage-wagons, being suddenly  galloped through the town. We fancied this a proof of defeat, but the  fact was simply thus: the peasants, from whom the horses had been taken,  finding the drivers of the wagons absent from their posts, seized the  opportunity to cut the traces, and gallop off with their cattle. As this  explanation, however, was not given till the following day, we thought  that all was over; the few British adherents who had remained were in  despair, and tri-coloured cockades were suspended from every house. Even  I, for the first time, lost all courage, and my only consolation was the  joy of Annette. \"England cannot be much injured by the loss of a Single  battle,\" thought I; \"and as for me, it is of little consequence whether  I am a prisoner on parole, or a mere wanderer at pleasure. I may easily  resign myself to my fate; but this poor girl would break her heart if  she lost her lover, for he is every thing to her.\" In this manner I  reasoned, but in spite of my affected philosophy, I could not divest  myself of all natural feeling; and when about six o'clock we heard that  the French had given way, and that the Prussians had eluded Grouche, and  were rapidly advancing to the field, I quite forgot poor Annette, and  thanked God with all my heart. At eight o'clock there was no longer any  doubt of our success, for a battalion of troops marched into the town,  and brought intelligence that the Duke of Wellington had gained a  complete victory, and that the French were flying, closely pursued by  the Prussians. Sunday night was employed in enthusiastic rejoicing. The  tri-coloured cockades had all disappeared, and the British colours were  hoisted from every window. The great bell of St. Gudule tolled, to  announce the event to the surrounding neighbourhood; and some of the  English, who had only hidden themselves, ventured to re-appear. The only  alloy to the universal rapture which prevailed, was the number of the  wounded; the houses were insufficient to contain half; and the churches  and public buildings were littered down with straw for their reception.  The body of the Duke of Brunswick, who fell at Quatre Bras, was brought  in on Saturday, and taken to the quarters he had occupied near the  Chateau de Lacken. I was powerfully affected when I saw the corpse of  one, whom I had so lately marked as blooming with youth and health; but  my eyes soon became accustomed to horrors. On Monday morning, June 19th,  I hastened to the field of battle: I was compelled to go through the  forest de Soignes, for the road was so completely choked up as to be  impassable.--The dead required no help; but thousands of wounded, who  could not help themselves, were in want of every thing; their features,  swollen by the sun and rain, looked livid and bloated. One poor fellow  had a ghastly wound across his lower lip, which gaped wide, and showed  his teeth and gums, as though a second and unnatural mouth had opened  below his first. Another, quite blind from a gash across his eyes, sat  upright, gasping for breath, and murmuring, \"De l'eau! de l'eau!\" The  anxiety for water, was indeed most distressing. The German \"Vaser!  vaser!\" and the French \"De l'eau! de l'eau!\" still seem sounding in my  ears. I am convinced that hundreds must have perished from thirst alone,  and they had no hope of assistance, for even humane persons were afraid  of approaching the scene of blood, lest they should be taken in  requisition to bury the dead; almost every person who came near, being  pressed into that most disgusting and painful service. This general  burying was truly horrible: large square holes were dug about six feet  deep, and thirty or forty fine young fellows stripped to their skins  were thrown into each, pell mell, and then covered over in so slovenly a  manner, that sometimes a hand or foot peeped through the earth. One of  these holes was preparing as I passed, and the followers of the army  were stripping the bodies before throwing them into it, whilst some  Russian Jews were assisting in the spoilation of the dead, by chiseling  out their teeth! an operation which they performed with the most brutal  indifference. The clinking hammers of these wretches jarred horribly  upon my ears, and mingled strangely with the occasional report of  pistols, which seemed echoing each other at stated intervals, from  different corners of the field. I could not divine the meaning of these  shots, till I was informed, that they proceeded from the Belgians, who  were killing the wounded horses. Hundreds of these fine creatures were,  indeed, galloping over the plain, kicking and plunging, apparently mad  with pain, whilst the poor wounded wretches who saw them coming, and  could not get out of their way, shrieked in agony, and tried to shrink  back to escape from them, but in vain. Soon after, I saw an immense  horse (one of the Scotch Greys) dash towards a colonel of the Imperial  Guard, who had had his leg shattered; the horse was frightfully wounded,  and part of a broken lance still rankled in one of its wounds. It rushed  snorting and plunging past the Frenchman, and I shall never forget his  piercing cry as it approached. I flew instantly to the spot, but ere I  reached it the man was dead; for, though I do not think the horse had  touched him, the terror he felt had been too much for his exhausted  frame. Sickened with the immense heaps of slain, which spread in all  directions as far as the eye could reach, I was preparing to return,  when as I was striding over the dead and dying, and meditating on the  horrors of war, my attention was attracted by a young Frenchman, who was  lying on his back, apparently at the last gasp. There was something in  his countenance which interested me, and I fancied, though I knew not  when, or where, that I had seen him before. Some open letters were lying  around, and one was yet grasped in his hand as though he had been  reading it to the last moment. My eye fell upon the words \"Mon cher  fils,\" in a female hand, and I felt interested for the fate of so  affectionate a son. When I left home in the morning, I had put a flask  of brandy and some biscuit into my pocket, in the hope that I might be  useful to the wounded, but when I gazed on the countless multitude which  strewed the field, I felt discouraged from attempting to relieve them.  Chance had now directed my attention to one individual, and I was  resolved to try to save his life. His thigh was broken, and he was badly  wounded on the left wrist, but the vital parts were untouched, and his  exhaustion seemed to arise principally from the loss of blood. I poured  a few drops of brandy into his mouth, and crumbling my biscuit contrived  to make him swallow a small particle. The effects of the dose were soon  visible; his eyes half opened, and a faint tinge of colour spread over  his cheek. I administered a little more, and it revived him so much that  he tried to sit upright. I raised him, and contriving to place him in  such a manner, as to support him against the dead body of a horse, I put  the flask and biscuit by his side, and departed in order to procure  assistance to remove him. I recollected that a short time before, I had  seen a smoke issuing from a deep ditch, and that my olfactory nerves had  been saluted by a savoury smell as I passed. Guided by these  indications, I retraced my steps to the spot, and found some Scotch  soldiers sheltered by a hedge, very agreeably employed in cooking a  quantity of beefsteaks over a wood tire, in a French cuirass!! I was  exceedingly diverted at this novel kind of frying-pan, which served also  as a dish; and after begging permission to dip a biscuit in their gravy  for the benefit of my patient, I told my tale, and was gratified by the  eagerness which they manifested to assist me; one ran to catch a horse  with a soft Hussar saddle, (there were hundreds galloping over the  field,) and the rest went with me to the youth, whom we found  surprisingly recovered, though he was still unable to speak. The horse  was brought, and as we raised the young Frenchman to put him upon it,  his vest opened, and his _\"livret\"_ fell out. This is a little book  which every French soldier is obliged to carry, and which contains an  account of his name, age, pay, accoutrements, and services. I picked it  up, and offered it to my patient--but the young man murmured the name of  \"Annette,\" and fainted. \"Annette!\" the name thrilled through every  nerve. I hastily opened the _livret,_ and found that it was indeed Louis  Tissand whom I had saved! The rest is soon told. Louis reached Brussels  in safety, and even Madame's selfishness gave way to rapture on  recovering her son. As to Annette--but why perplex myself to describe  her feelings? If my readers have ever loved, they may conceive them.  Louis soon recovered; indeed with such a nurse he could not fail to get  well. When I next visited Brussels, I found Annette surrounded by three  or tour smiling cherubs, to whom I was presented as _le bon Anglais,_  who preserved the life of their papa.             *       *       *       *       *    NOTES OF A"]]]
