'A highwayman!' whispered Tom Cobb to Parkes the ranger.    'Do you suppose highwaymen don't dress handsomer than that?' replied  Parkes. 'It's a better business than you think for, Tom, and highwaymen  don't need or use to be shabby, take my word for it.'    Meanwhile the subject of their speculations had done due honour to the  house by calling for some drink, which was promptly supplied by the  landlord's son Joe, a broad-shouldered strapping young fellow of twenty,  whom it pleased his father still to consider a little boy, and to treat  accordingly. Stretching out his hands to warm them by the blazing fire,  the man turned his head towards the company, and after running his eye  sharply over them, said in a voice well suited to his appearance:    'What house is that which stands a mile or so from here?'    'Public-house?' said the landlord, with his usual deliberation.    'Public-house, father!' exclaimed Joe, 'where's the public-house  within a mile or so of the Maypole? He means the great house--the  Warren--naturally and of course. The old red brick house, sir, that  stands in its own grounds--?'    'Aye,' said the stranger.    'And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as  broad, which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed hands  and dwindled away--more's the pity!' pursued the young man.    'Maybe,' was the reply. 'But my question related to the owner. What it  has been I don't care to know, and what it is I can see for myself.'    The heir-apparent to the Maypole pressed his finger on his lips, and  glancing at the young gentleman already noticed, who had changed his  attitude when the house was first mentioned, replied in a lower tone:    'The owner's name is Haredale, Mr Geoffrey Haredale, and'--again  he glanced in the same direction as before--'and a worthy gentleman  too--hem!'    Paying as little regard to this admonitory cough, as to the significant  gesture that had preceded it, the stranger pursued his questioning.    'I turned out of my way coming here, and took the footpath that crosses  the grounds. Who was the young lady that I saw entering a carriage? His  daughter?'    'Why, how should I know, honest man?' replied Joe, contriving in the  course of some arrangements about the hearth, to advance close to his  questioner and pluck him by the sleeve, 'I didn't see the young lady,  you know. Whew! There's the wind again--AND rain--well it IS a night!'    Rough weather indeed!' observed the strange man.    'You're used to it?' said Joe, catching at anything which seemed to  promise a diversion of the subject.    'Pretty well,' returned the other. 'About the young lady--has Mr  Haredale a daughter?'    'No, no,' said the young fellow fretfully, 'he's a single  gentleman--he's--be quiet, can't you, man? Don't you see this talk is  not relished yonder?'    Regardless of this whispered remonstrance, and affecting not to hear it,  his tormentor provokingly continued:    'Single men have had daughters before now. Perhaps she may be his  daughter, though he is not married.'    'What do you mean?' said Joe, adding in an undertone as he approached  him again, 'You'll come in for it presently, I know you will!'    'I mean no harm'--returned the traveller boldly, 'and have said none  that I know of. I ask a few questions--as any stranger may, and not  unnaturally--about the inmates of a remarkable house in a neighbourhood  which is new to me, and you are as aghast and disturbed as if I were  talking treason against King George. Perhaps you can tell me why, sir,  for (as I say) I am a stranger, and this is Greek to me?'    The latter observation was addressed to the obvious cause of Joe  Willet's discomposure, who had risen and was adjusting his riding-cloak  preparatory to sallying abroad. Briefly replying that he could give him  no information, the young man beckoned to Joe, and handing him a piece  of money in payment of his reckoning, hurried out attended by young  Willet himself, who taking up a candle followed to light him to the  house-door.    While Joe was absent on this errand, the elder Willet and his three  companions continued to smoke with profound gravity, and in a deep  silence, each having his eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that was  suspended over the fire. After some time John Willet slowly shook his  head, and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs; but no man withdrew  his eyes from the boiler, or altered the solemn expression of his  countenance in the slightest degree.    At length Joe returned--very talkative and conciliatory, as though with  a strong presentiment that he was going to be found fault with.    'Such a thing as love is!' he said, drawing a chair near the fire, and  looking round for sympathy. 'He has set off to walk to London,--all  the way to London. His nag gone lame in riding out here this blessed  afternoon, and comfortably littered down in our stable at this minute;  and he giving up a good hot supper and our best bed, because Miss  Haredale has gone to a masquerade up in town, and he has set his heart  upon seeing her! I don't think I could persuade myself to do that,  beautiful as she is,--but then I'm not in love (at least I don't think I  am) and that's the whole difference.'    'He is in love then?' said the stranger.    'Rather,' replied Joe. 'He'll never be more in love, and may very easily  be less.'    'Silence, sir!' cried his father.    'What a chap you are, Joe!' said Long Parkes.    'Such a inconsiderate lad!' murmured Tom Cobb.    'Putting himself forward and wringing the very nose off his own father's  face!' exclaimed the parish-clerk, metaphorically.    'What HAVE I done?' reasoned poor Joe.    'Silence, sir!' returned his father, 'what do you mean by talking, when  you see people that are more than two or three times your age, sitting  still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word?'    'Why that's the proper time for me to talk, isn't it?' said Joe  rebelliously.    'The proper time, sir!' retorted his father, 'the proper time's no  time.'    'Ah to be sure!' muttered Parkes, nodding gravely to the other two who  nodded likewise, observing under their breaths that that was the point.    'The proper time's no time, sir,' repeated John Willet; 'when I was  your age I never talked, I never wanted to talk. I listened and improved  myself that's what I did.'    'And you'd find your father rather a tough customer in argeyment, Joe,  if anybody was to try and tackle him,' said Parkes.    'For the matter o' that, Phil!' observed Mr Willet, blowing a long,  thin, spiral cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth, and staring  at it abstractedly as it floated away; 'For the matter o' that, Phil,  argeyment is a gift of Natur. If Natur has gifted a man with powers  of argeyment, a man has a right to make the best of 'em, and has not  a right to stand on false delicacy, and deny that he is so gifted; for  that is a turning of his back on Natur, a flouting of her, a slighting  of her precious caskets, and a proving of one's self to be a swine that  isn't worth her scattering pearls before.'    The landlord pausing here for a very long time, Mr Parkes naturally  concluded that he had brought his discourse to an end; and therefore,  turning to the young man with some austerity, exclaimed:    'You hear what your father says, Joe? You wouldn't much like to tackle  him in argeyment, I'm thinking, sir.'    'IF,' said John Willet, turning his eyes from the ceiling to the face of  his interrupter, and uttering the monosyllable in capitals, to apprise  him that he had put in his oar, as the vulgar say, with unbecoming  and irreverent haste; 'IF, sir, Natur has fixed upon me the gift of  argeyment, why should I not own to it, and rather glory in the same?  Yes, sir, I AM a tough customer that way. You are right, sir. My  toughness has been proved, sir, in this room many and many a time, as I  think you know; and if you don't know,' added John, putting his pipe in  his mouth again, 'so much the better, for I an't proud and am not going  to tell you.'    A general murmur from his three cronies, and a general shaking of  heads at the copper boiler, assured John Willet that they had had good  experience of his powers and needed no further evidence to assure them  of his superiority. John smoked with a little more dignity and surveyed  them in silence.    'It's all very fine talking,' muttered Joe, who had been fidgeting in  his chair with divers uneasy gestures. 'But if you mean to tell me that  I'm never to open my lips--'    'Silence, sir!' roared his father. 'No, you never are. When your  opinion's wanted, you give it. When you're spoke to, you speak. When  your opinion's not wanted and you're not spoke to, don't you give an  opinion and don't you speak. The world's undergone a nice alteration  since my time, certainly. My belief is that there an't any boys  left--that there isn't such a thing as a boy--that there's nothing now  between a male baby and a man--and that all the boys went out with his  blessed Majesty King George the Second.'    'That's a very true observation, always excepting the young princes,'  said the parish-clerk, who, as the representative of church and state in  that company, held himself bound to the nicest loyalty. 'If it's godly  and righteous for boys, being of the ages of boys, to behave themselves  like boys, then the young princes must be boys and cannot be otherwise.'    'Did you ever hear tell of mermaids, sir?' said Mr Willet.    'Certainly I have,' replied the clerk.    'Very good,' said Mr Willet. 'According to the constitution of mermaids,  so much of a mermaid as is not a woman must be a fish. According to the  constitution of young princes, so much of a young prince (if anything)  as is not actually an angel, must be godly and righteous. Therefore if  it's becoming and godly and righteous in the young princes (as it is  at their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#3)"],[1,"individual reactions is shown in Table III. by a  group of selected reactions, all given by normal subjects.

It has been the purpose of this study to establish as far as possible  strictly objective criteria for distinguishing normal from abnormal  associations, and for this reason we have made no attempt to determine  by means of introspection the causes of variations of reaction time.    It would seem that the importance and magnitude of the problem of  association time are such as to demand not merely a crude measurement  of the gross reaction time in a large number of cases, but rather a  special investigation by such exact methods as have been used by  Cattell [1] and others in the analysis of the complex reaction. It  would be impracticable for us to employ such methods in a study so  extensive as this.    [Footnote 1: Mind, Vol. XI, 1886.]    In view of these considerations we discontinued the recording of the  reaction time.    If the association test is to be useful in the study of pathological  conditions, it is of great importance to have a reliable measure of  the associational value of a pair of ideas. Many attempts have been  made to modify and amplify the classical grouping of associations  according to similarity, contrast, contiguity, and sequence, so as to  make it serviceable in differentiating between normal and abnormal  associations.    In this study we attempted to apply Aschaffenburg's [1] classification  of reactions, but without success. Our failure to utilize this system  of classification is assigned to the following considerations: (1)  Distinctions between associations according to logical relations are  extremely difficult to define; in many cases there is room for  difference of opinion as to the proper place for an association, and  thus the application of a logical scheme depends largely upon the  personal equation of the observer; that even experienced observers  cannot, in all cases, agree in placing an association is shown by  Aschaffenburg's criticisms of the opinions of other observers on this  point.[2] (2) Logical distinctions do not bring out clearly the  differences between the reactions of normal subjects and those of  insane subjects; logically, the reaction _bath--ink_, which was given  by a patient, might be placed in the class with the reaction  _bath--water_, although there is an obvious difference between the two  reactions. (3) Many of the reactions given by insane subjects possess  no obvious logical value whatever; but since any combination of ideas  may represent a relationship, either real or imagined, it would be  arbitrary to characterize such a reaction as incoherent.    [Footnote 1: Experimentelle Studien uber Association. Psychologische  Arbeiten, Vol. I, p. 209; Vol. II, p. 1; Vol. IV, p. 235.]    [Footnote 2: Loc. cit, Vol. 1, pp. 226-227.]    The criterion of values which is used in this study is an empirical  one. As has already been explained (p. 8), every word contained in the  frequency tables possesses a value of at least 0.1 per cent, and other  words have a zero value. With the aid of our method the difficulty of  classifying the reactions quoted above is obviated, as it is necessary  only to refer to the table to find their proper values: the value of  the reaction _bath--water_ is 33.9 per cent, while that of the  reaction _bath--ink_ is 0.    Logically the combination _health--wealth_ may be placed in any  one of four classes, as follows:                        / intrinsic / causal dependence    health--wealth /            \\ coordination                   \\                    \\ extrinsic / speech reminiscence                                \\ sound similarity      But since our table shows this association to have an empirical value  of 7.6 per cent, it becomes immaterial which of its logical relations  is to be considered the strongest. It is mainly important, from our  point of view, to separate reactions possessing an empirical value  from those whose value is zero.        § 6. AN EMPIRICAL PRINCIPLE OF NORMAL ASSOCIATION.      On a general survey of the whole mass of material which forms the  basis of the first part of this study, we are led to observe that  _the one tendency which appears to be almost universal among normal  persons is the tendency to give in response to any stimulus word one  or another of a small group of common reactions_.    It appears from the pathological material now on hand that this  tendency is greatly weakened in some cases of mental disease. Many  patients have given more than 50 per cent of individual reactions.    It should be mentioned that occasionally a presumably normal subject  has given a record very similar to those obtained from patients, in  respect to both the number and the nature of the individual reactions.  A few subjects who gave peculiar reactions were known to possess  significant eccentricities, and for this reason we excluded their  records from the thousand records which furnished the basis for the  frequency tables; we excluded also a few peculiar records obtained  from subjects of whom nothing was known, on the ground that such  records would serve only to make the tables more cumbersome, without  adding anything to their practical value. The total number of records  thus excluded was seventeen.    It will be apparent to anyone who examines the frequency tables that  the reactions obtained from one thousand persons fall short of  exhausting the normal associational possibilities of these stimulus  words. The tables, however, have been found to be sufficiently  inclusive for the practical purpose which they were intended to  serve. Common reactions, whether given by a sane or an insane subject,  may, in the vast majority of instances, safely be regarded as  normal. As to individual reactions, they cannot all be regarded as  abnormal, but they include nearly all those reactions which are worthy  of special analysis in view of their possible pathological  significance. What can be said further of individual reactions,  whether normal or abnormal, will appear in the second part of this  contribution.          PART II.    ASSOCIATION IN INSANE SUBJECTS.        § 1. GENERAL SURVEY OF PATHOLOGICAL MATERIAL.      The pathological material which forms the basis of the present part of  our study consists mainly of two hundred and forty-seven test records  obtained for the most part from patients at the Kings Park State  Hospital.    The different groups from which the cases were selected, together with  the number from each group, are shown in Table I.      TABLE I.    Dementia præcox                     108 cases.  Paranoic conditions                  33   \"  Epilepsy                             24   \"  General Paresis                      32   \"  Manic-depressive insanity            32   \"  Involuntary melancholia               8   \"  Alcoholic psychoses                   6   \"  Senile dementia                       4   \"      A comparison of our pathological with our normal material _en  masse_ reveals in the former evidence of a weakening of the normal  tendency to respond by common reactions. This is shown in Table II.      TABLE II.                            Common     Doubtful     Individual                         reactions.  reactions.   reactions.  1,000 normal subject     91.7%        1.5%         6.8%    247 insane subjects      70.7%        2.5%        26.8%      It seems evident from this that pathological significance attaches  mainly to individual reactions, so that our study resolves itself  largely into (1) an analysis and classification of individual  reactions and (2) an attempt to determine what relationship, if any,  exists between the different types of reactions and the different  clinical forms of mental disease.        § 2. CLASSIFICATION OF REACTIONS.      Those who have attempted to use the association test in the study of  insanity have felt the need of a practical classification of  reactions, and have at the same time encountered the difficulty of  establishing definite criteria for distinguishing the different groups  from one another. It is a comparatively simple matter to make these  distinctions in a general way and even to formulate a more or less  comprehensive theoretical classification, but there still remains much  difficulty in practice. We have made repeated attempts to utilize  various systems of classification which involve free play of personal  equation in their application. Although for us the matter is greatly  simplified by the elimination of all the common reactions with the aid  of the frequency tables, we have nevertheless met with no success. The  distinctions made by either of us have on no occasion fully satisfied,  at the second reading, either the one who made them or the other,  while a comparison of the distinctions made by each of us  independently has shown a disagreement to the extent of 20-35 per  cent.    We sought, therefore, to formulate a classification in which the  various groups should be so defined as to obviate the interference of  personal equation in the work of applying it, hoping thus to achieve  greater accuracy. In this we can lay claim to only partial success;  for, in the first place, having satisfactorily defined a number of  groups,"]]]
