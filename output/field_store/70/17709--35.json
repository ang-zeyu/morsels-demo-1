(1) Cf. chap. iii., \"On Nature as the Embodiment of Number,\" of my _A  Mathematical Theory of Spirit_, to which reference has already been  made.      According to BERGSON, life--the reality that can only be lived, not  understood--is absolutely continuous (_i.e_. not amenable to numerical  treatment). It is because life is absolutely continuous that we cannot,  he says, understand it; for reason acts discontinuously, grasping only,  so to speak, a cinematographic view of life, made up of an immense  number of instantaneous glimpses. All that passes between the glimpses  is lost, and so the true whole, reason can never synthesise from that  which it possesses. On the other hand, one might also argue--extending,  in a way, the teaching of the physical sciences of the period between  the postulation of DALTON'S atomic theory and the discovery of the  significance of the ether of space--that reality is essentially  discontinuous, our idea that it is continuous being a mere illusion  arising from the coarseness of our senses. That might provide a complete  vindication of the Pythagorean view; but a better vindication, if not  of that theory, at any rate of PYTHAGORAS' philosophical attitude,  is forthcoming, I think, in the fact that modern mathematics has  transcended the shackles of number, and has enlarged her kingdom, so as  to include quantities other than numerical. PYTHAGORAS, had he been  born in these latter centuries, would surely have rejoiced in this,  enlargement, whereby the continuous as well as the discontinuous is  brought, if not under the rule of number, under the rule of mathematics  indeed.    PYTHAGORAS' foremost achievement in mathematics I have already  mentioned. Another notable piece of work in the same department was  the discovery of a method of constructing a parallelogram having a side  equal to a given line, an angle equal to a given angle, and its area  equal to that of a given triangle. PYTHAGORAS is said to have celebrated  this discovery by the sacrifice of a whole ox. The problem appears in  the first book of EUCLID'S _Elements of Geometry_ as proposition 44. In  fact, many of the propositions of EUCLID'S first, second, fourth, and  sixth books were worked out by PYTHAGORAS and the Pythagoreans; but,  curiously enough, they seem greatly to have neglected the geometry of  the circle.    The symmetrical solids were regarded by PYTHAGORAS, and by the Greek  thinkers after him, as of the greatest importance. To be perfectly  symmetrical or regular, a solid must have an equal number of faces  meeting at each of its angles, and these faces must be equal regular  polygons, _i.e_. figures whose sides and angles are all equal.  PYTHAGORAS, perhaps, may be credited with the great discovery that there  are only five such solids. These are as follows:--    The Tetrahedron, having four equilateral triangles as faces.    The Cube, having six squares as faces.    The Octahedron, having eight equilateral triangles as faces.    The Dodecahedron, having twelve regular pentagons (or five-sided  figures) as faces.    The Icosahedron, having twenty equilateral triangles as faces.(1)      (1) If the reader will copy figs. 4 to 8 on cardboard or stiff paper,  bend each along the dotted lines so as to form a solid, fastening  together the free edges with gummed paper, he will be in possession of  models of the five solids in question.      Now, the Greeks believed the world to be composed of four  elements--earth, air, fire, water,--and to the Greek mind the conclusion  was inevitable(2a) that the shapes of the particles of the elements  were those of the regular solids. Earth-particles were cubical, the cube  being the regular solid possessed of greatest stability; fire-particles  were tetrahedral, the tetrahedron being the simplest and, hence,  lightest solid. Water-particles were icosahedral for exactly the reverse  reason, whilst air-particles, as intermediate between the two latter,  were octahedral. The dodecahedron was, to these ancient mathematicians,  the most mysterious of the solids: it was by far the most difficult to  construct, the accurate drawing of the regular pentagon necessitating a  rather elaborate application of PYTHAGORAS' great theorem.(1) Hence the  conclusion, as PLATO put it, that \"this (the regular dodecahedron) the  Deity employed in tracing the plan of the Universe.\"(2b) Hence also  the high esteem in which the pentagon was held by the Pythagoreans. By  producing each side of this latter figure the five-pointed star (fig.  9), known as the pentagram, is obtained. This was adopted by the  Pythagoreans as the badge of their Society, and for many ages was held  as a symbol possessed of magic powers. The mediaeval magicians made use  of it in their evocations, and as a talisman it was held in the highest  esteem.      (2a) _Cf_. PLATO: The Timaeus, SESE xxviii--xxx.    (1) In reference to this matter FRANKLAND remarks: \"In those early days  the innermost secrets of nature lay in the lap of geometry, and the  extraordinary inference follows that Euclid's _Elements_, which are  devoted to the investigation of the regular solids, are therefore in  reality and at bottom an attempt to 'solve the universe.' Euclid,  in fact, made this goal of the Pythagoreans the aim of his  _Elements_.\"--_Op. cit_., p. 35.    (2b) _Op. cit_., SE xxix.      Music played an important part in the curriculum of the Pythagorean  Brotherhood, and the important discovery that the relations between  the notes of musical scales can be expressed by means of numbers is a  Pythagorean one. It must have seemed to its discoverer--as, in a sense,  it indeed is--a striking confirmation of the numerical theory of the  Cosmos. The Pythagoreans held that the positions of the heavenly bodies  were governed by similar numerical relations, and that in consequence  their motion was productive of celestial music. This concept of \"the  harmony of the spheres\" is among the most celebrated of the Pythagorean  doctrines, and has found ready acceptance in many mystically-speculative  minds. \"Look how the floor of heaven,\" says Lorenzo in SHAKESPEARE'S  _The Merchant of Venice_--     \"... Look how the floor of heaven   Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:   There's not the smallest orb which thou behold's\"   But in his motion like an angel sings,   Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;   Such harmony is in immortal souls;   But whilst this muddy vesture of decay   Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\"(1)      (1) Act v. scene i.    Or, as KINGSLEY writes in one of his letters, \"When I walk the fields I  am oppressed every now and then with an innate feeling that everything  I see has a meaning, if I could but understand it. And this feeling  of being surrounded with truths which I cannot grasp, amounts to an  indescribable awe sometimes! Everything seems to be full of God's  reflex, if we could but see it. Oh! how I have prayed to have the  mystery unfolded, at least hereafter. To see, if but for a moment, the  whole harmony of the great system! To hear once the music which the  whole universe makes as it performs His bidding!\"(1) In this connection  may be mentioned the very significant fact that the Pythagoreans did  not consider the earth, in accordance with current opinion, to be a  stationary body, but believed that it and the other planets revolved  about a central point, or fire, as they called it.      (1) CHARLES KINGSLEY: _His Letters and Memories of His Life_, edited by  his wife (1883), p. 28.      As concerns PYTHAGORAS' ethical teaching, judging from the so-called  _Golden Verses_ attributed to him, and no doubt written by one of his  disciples,(2) this would appear to be in some respects similar to that  of the Stoics who came later, but free from the materialism of the Stoic  doctrines. Due regard for oneself is blended with regard for the gods  and for other men, the atmosphere of the whole being at once rational  and austere. One verse--\"Thou shalt likewise know, according to Justice,  that the nature of this Universe is in all things alike\"(3)--is of  particular interest, as showing PYTHAGORAS' belief in that principle of  analogy--that \"What is below is as that which is above, what is above is  as that which is below\"--which held so dominant a sway over the minds of  ancient and mediaeval philosophers, leading them--in spite, I suggest,  of its fundamental truth--into so many fantastic errors, as we shall  see in future excursions. Metempsychosis was another of the Pythagorean  tenets, a fact which is interesting in view of the modern revival  of this doctrine. PYTHAGORAS, no doubt, derived it from the East,  apparently introducing it for the first time to Western thought.      (2) It seems probable, though not certain, that PYTHAGORAS wrote nothing  himself, but taught always by the oral method.    (3) Cf. the remarks of HIEROCLES on this verse in his _Commentary_.      Such, in brief, were the outstanding doctrines of the Pythagorean  Brotherhood. Their teachings included, as we have seen, what may justly  be called scientific discoveries of the first importance, as well as  doctrines which, though we may feel compelled--perhaps rightly--to  regard them as fantastic now, had an immense influence on the thought of  succeeding ages, especially on Greek philosophy as represented by PLATO  and the Neo-Platonists, and the more speculative minds--the occult  philosophers, shall I say?--of the latter mediaeval period and  succeeding centuries. The Brotherhood, however, was not destined to  continue its days in peace. As I have indicated, it was a philosophical,  not a political, association; but naturally PYTHAGORAS' philosophy  included political doctrines. At any rate, the Brotherhood acquired a  considerable share in the government of Croton, a fact which was greatly  resented by the members of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#4)"],[1,"is no remedy,\" said Merlin,  \"and God's will must be done; but be ye all to-morrow before him, for God  will make him speak before he die.\"    So on the morrow all the barons, with Merlin, stood round the bedside of  the king; and Merlin said aloud to Uther, \"Lord, shall thy son Arthur be  the king of all this realm after thy days?\"    Then Uther Pendragon turned him about, and said, in the hearing of them  all, \"God's blessing and mine be upon him. I bid him pray for my soul, and  also that he claim my crown, or forfeit all my blessing;\" and with those  words he died.    Then came together all the bishops and the clergy, and great multitudes of  people, and bewailed the king; and carrying his body to the convent of  Ambrius, they buried it close by his brother's grave, within the \"Giants'  Dance.\"          CHAPTER II    _The Miracle of the Sword and Stone, and the Coronation of King  Arthur--The Sword Excalilur--The War with the Eleven Kings_      Now Arthur the prince had all this time been nourished in Sir Ector's  house as his own son, and was fair and tall and comely, being of the age  of fifteen years, great in strength, gentle in manner, and accomplished in  all exercises proper for the training of a knight.    But as yet he knew not of his father; for Merlin had so dealt, that none  save Uther and himself knew aught about him. Wherefore it befell, that  many of the knights and barons who heard King Uther speak before his  death, and call his son Arthur his successor, were in great amazement; and  some doubted, and others were displeased.    Anon the chief lords and princes set forth each to his own land, and,  raising armed men and multitudes of followers, determined every one to  gain the crown for himself; for they said in their hearts, \"If there be  any such a son at all as he of whom this wizard forced the king to speak,  who are we that a beardless boy should have rule over us?\"    So the land stood long in great peril, for every lord and baron sought but  his own advantage; and the Saxons, growing ever more adventurous, wasted  and overran the towns and villages in every part.    Then Merlin went to Brice, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and advised him  to require all the earls and barons of the realm and all knights and  gentlemen-at-arms to come to him at London, before Christmas, under pain  of cursing, that they might learn the will of Heaven who should be king.  This, therefore, the archbishop did, and upon Christmas Eve were met  together in London all the greatest princes, lords, and barons; and long  before day they prayed in St. Paul's Church, and the archbishop besought  Heaven for a sign who should be lawful king of all the realm.    And as they prayed, there was seen in the churchyard, set straight before  the doorways of the church, a huge square stone having a naked sword stuck  in the midst of it. And on the sword was written in letters of gold,  \"Whoso pulleth out the sword from this stone is born the rightful King of  Britain.\"    At this all the people wondered greatly; and, when Mass was over, the  nobles, knights, and princes ran out eagerly from the church to see the  stone and sword; and a law was forthwith made that whoso should pull out  the sword should be acknowledged straightway King of Britain.    Then many knights and barons pulled at the sword with all their might, and  some of them tried many times, but none could stir or move it.    When all had tried in vain, the archbishop declared the man whom Heaven  had chosen was not yet there. \"But God,\" said he, \"will doubtless make  him known ere many days.\"    So ten knights were chosen, being men of high renown, to watch and keep  the sword; and there was proclamation made through all the land that  whosoever would, had leave and liberty to try and pull it from the stone.  But though great multitudes of people came, both gentle and simple, for  many days, no man could ever move the sword a hair's breadth from its  place.    Now, at the New Year's Eve a great tournament was to be held in London,  which the archbishop had devised to keep together lords and commons, lest  they should grow estranged in the troublous and unsettled times. To the  which tournament there came, with many other knights, Sir Ector, Arthur's  foster-father, who had great possessions near to London; and with him came  his son, Sir Key, but recently made knight, to take his part in the  jousting, and young Arthur also to witness all the sports and fighting.    But as they rode towards the jousts, Sir Key found suddenly he had no  sword, for he had left it at his father's house; and turning to young  Arthur, he prayed him to ride back and fetch it for him. \"I will with a  good will,\" said Arthur; and rode fast back after the sword.    But when he came to the house he found it locked and empty, for all were  gone forth to see the tournament. Whereat, being angry and impatient, he  said within himself, \"I will ride to the churchyard and take with me the  sword that sticketh in the stone, for my brother shall not go without a  sword this day.\"    So he rode and came to the churchyard, and alighting from his horse he  tied him to the gate, and went to the pavilion, which was pitched near  the stone, wherein abode the ten knights who watched and kept it; but he  found no knights there, for all were gone to see the jousting.    Then he took the sword by its handle, and lightly and fiercely he pulled  it out of the stone, and took his horse and rode until he came to Sir Key  and delivered him the sword. But as soon as Sir Key saw it he knew well it  was the sword of the stone, and, riding swiftly to his father, he cried  out, \"Lo! here, sir, is the sword of the stone, wherefore it is I who must  be king of all this land.\"    When Sir Ector saw the sword, he turned back straight with Arthur and Sir  Key and came to the churchyard, and there alighting, they went all three  into the church, and Sir Key was sworn to tell truly how he came by the  sword. Then he confessed it was his brother Arthur who had brought it to  him.    Whereat Sir Ector, turning to young Arthur, asked him--\"How gottest thou  the sword?\"    \"Sir,\" said he, \"I will tell you. When I went home to fetch my brother's  sword, I found nobody to deliver it to me, for all were abroad to the  jousts. Yet was I loath to leave my brother swordless, and, bethinking me  of this one, I came hither eagerly to fetch it for him, and pulled it out  of the stone without any pain.\"    Then said Sir Ector, much amazed and looking steadfastly on Arthur, \"If  this indeed be thus, 'tis thou who shalt be king of all this land--and God  will have it so--for none but he who should be rightful Lord of Britain  might ever draw this sword forth from that stone. But let me now with mine  own eyes see thee put back the sword into its place and draw it forth  again.\"    \"That is no mystery,\" said Arthur; and straightway set it in the stone.  And then Sir Ector pulled at it himself, and after him Sir Key, with all  his might, but both of them in vain: then Arthur reaching forth his hand  and grasping at the pommel, pulled it out easily, and at once.    Then fell Sir Ector down upon his knees upon the ground before young  Arthur, and Sir Key also with him, and straightway did him homage as their  sovereign lord.    [Illustration: Then fell Sir Ector down upon his knees upon the ground  before young Arthur, and Sir Key also with him.]    But Arthur cried aloud, \"Alas! mine own dear father and my brother, why  kneel ye thus to me?\"    \"Nay, my Lord Arthur,\" answered then Sir Ector, \"we are of no  blood-kinship with thee, and little though I thought how high thy kin  might be, yet wast thou never more than foster-child of mine.\" And then he  told him all he knew about his infancy, and how a stranger had delivered  him, with a great sum of gold, into his hands to be brought up and  nourished as his own born child, and then had disappeared.    But when young Arthur heard of it, he fell upon Sir Ector's neck, and  wept, and made great lamentation, \"For now,\" said he, \"I have in one day  lost my father and my mother and my brother.\"    \"Sir,\" said Sir Ector presently, \"when thou shalt be made king be good and  gracious unto me and mine.\"    \"If not,\" said Arthur, \"I were no true man's son at all, for thou art he  in all the world to whom I owe the most; and my good lady and mother, thy  wife, hath ever kept and fostered me as though I were her own; so if it be  God's will that I be king hereafter as thou sayest, desire of me whatever  thing thou wilt and I will do it; and God forbid that I should fail thee  in it.\"    \"I will but pray,\" replied Sir Ector, \"that thou wilt make my son Sir Key,  thy foster-brother, seneschal of all the lands.\"    \"That shall he be,\" said Arthur; \"and never shall another hold that  office, save thy son, while he and I do live.\"    Anon, they left the church and went to the archbishop to tell him that the  sword had been achieved. And when he saw the sword in Arthur's hand he set  a day and summoned all the princes, knights, and barons to meet again at  St. Paul's Church and see the will of Heaven signified. So when they came  together, the sword was put back in the stone, and all tried, from the  greatest to the least, to move it; but there before them all not one could  take it out save Arthur only.    But then befell a great confusion and dispute, for some cried out it was  the will of Heaven, and, \"Long live King Arthur,\" but many more were full  of wrath and said, \"What! would ye give the ancient sceptre of this land  unto a boy born none know how?\" And the contention growing greatly, till  nothing could be done to pacify their rage, the meeting was at length  broken up by the archbishop and adjourned till Candlemas, when all should  meet again.    But when Candlemas was come, Arthur alone again pulled forth the sword,  though more than ever came to win it; and the barons, sorely vexed and"]]]
