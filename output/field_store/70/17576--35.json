As early as 1613, he had  boldly declared in Parliament that even the King's authority rested upon  the clear understanding that there were reciprocal conditions which  neither ruler nor subject could violate with impunity. He might not too  fancifully be called the \"Father of American Constitutionalism,\" for he  caused a constitution--possibly the first time that that word was ever  applied to a comprehensive scheme of government--to be drafted for the  little colony of Virginia in 1609 and amplified in 1612. Speaking in  this venerable Hall, whose very walls eloquently remind us of the mighty  genius of Francis Bacon, it is interesting to recall that these two  charters of government, which were the beginning of Constitutionalism in  America and therefore the germ of the Constitution of the United States,  were put in legal form for royal approval by Lord Bacon himself. Thus  the immortal Treasurer of this Inn is directly linked with the  development of Constitutional freedom in America.    Bacon became a member of the council for the Virginia Company in 1609.  His deep interest in it is attested in the dedication to him by William  Strachey in 1618 of the latter's _Historie of Travaile into Virginia  Brittania_.    In his speech in the House of Commons on January 30, 1621, Bacon saw a  vision of the future and predicted the growth of America, when he said:        \"This kingdom now first in His Majesty's Times hath gotten a lot or      portion in the New World by the plantation of Virginia and the      Summer Islands. And certainly it is with the kingdoms on earth as it      is in the kingdom of heaven, sometimes a grain of mustard seed      proves a great tree.\"    Truly the mustard seed of Virginia did become a great tree in the  American Commonwealth.    One of Bacon's nephews, also of the Inns of Court, Nathaniel Bacon,  became the first Liberal leader in the Colonies, and led the first  revolt against colonial misrule. He was probably of Gray's Inn, for it  is difficult to imagine a Bacon studying in any Inn than the one to  which the great Bacon had given so much loving care.    Due to these charters, on July 30, 1619, the little remnant of colonists  whom disease and famine had left untouched were summoned to meet in the  church at Jamestown to form the first parliamentary assembly in America,  the first-born of the fruitful Mother of Parliaments. It was due to  Sandys not only that the first permanent English settlement in the  Western World was planted at Jamestown in 1607, but that a later group  of \"adventurers\"--for such they called themselves--destined to be more  famous, were driven by chance of wind and wave to land on the coast of  Massachusetts. Thus was established, not only the beginning of England's  colonial Empire--still one of the most beneficent forces in the  world--but also the principle of local self-government, which, in the  Western World, was destined to develop the American Commonwealth. The  compact, signed in the cabin of the _Mayflower_, while not in strictness  a constitution, like the Virginia Charter, was yet destined to be a  landmark of history.    Sandys suffered for his convictions, for the party of reaction convinced  King James that Virginia was a nest of sedition, and the arbitrary  ruler, in the reorganization of the London company, gave a pointed  admonition by saying: \"Choose the devil, if you will, but not Sir Edwin  Sandys.\" In 1621 he was committed to the Tower and only released after  the House of Commons had made a vigorous protest against his  incarceration. His successor as treasurer of the London company was  Shakespeare's patron, the Earl of Southampton, and it is not a fanciful  conjecture to assume that, when the news of the disaster which befell  one of the fleets of the London Company on the Island of Bermuda reached  England, it inspired Shakespeare to write his incomparable sea idyl,  _The Tempest_. If so, this lovely drama was Shakespeare's unconscious  apostrophe to America, for in Ariel--seeking to be free--can be  symbolized her awakening spirit, while Prospero, with his thaumaturgic  achievements, suggests a constructive genius, which in a little more  than a century has made one of the least of the nations to-day one of  the greatest.    Bacon, Sandys, Southampton and the Liberal leaders of the House of  Commons had implanted in the ideas of the colonists the spirit of  constitutionalism, which was destined to influence profoundly the whole  development of the American colonies, and finally to culminate in the  Constitution of the United States.    The later struggle in the Long Parliament, the fall of Charles I, and  more especially the deposition of James II, the accession of William of  Orange, and the substitution for the Stuart claim of divine right that  of the supremacy of the people in Parliament, naturally had their  reaction in the Western World in intensifying the spirit of  constitutionalism in the growing American Commonwealth.    The colonial history was therefore increasingly marked by a spirit of  individualism, a natural partiality for local rule, and a tenacious  adherence to their special privileges, whether granted to Crown  colonies, like New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, the two  Carolinas, and Georgia, or proprietary governments, like Maryland,  Delaware, and Pennsylvania, or charter governments, such as  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. In the three colonies last  named formal corporate charters were granted by the Crown, which in  themselves were constitutions in embryo, and the colonists thus acquired  written rights as to the government of their internal affairs, upon the  maintenance of which they jealously insisted. Thus arose the spirit in  America, which treated constitutional rights, not so much as special  privileges granted by plenary Sovereignty, but as contractual  obligations which could be enforced in the Courts against the Sovereign.    All this developed in the colonists a powerful sense of constitutional  morality, and its pertinency to my present theme lies in the fact that  when each of the thirteen colonies became, at the conclusion of the War  of Independence, a separate and independent nation, they were more  concerned, in establishing a central government, to limit its authority  and to maintain local self-government than they were to give to the  new-born nation the powers which it needed. They carried their  constitutionalism to extremes, which nearly made a strong and efficient  central government an impossibility.    Nothing was less desired by them than a unified government. It was  destined to be wrung from their hard necessities. The Constitution was  the reflex action of two opposing tendencies, the one the imperative  need of an efficient central government, and the other the passionate  attachment to local self-rule. Co-operation between the colonies had  been a matter of long discussion and earnest debate, and primarily  resulted from the necessity of defence against a common foe the French  in Canada, and the Indians of the forest. In 1643 four of the New  England colonies united in a league to defend themselves. In 1693  William Penn made the first suggestion for a union of all the colonies.  In 1734 a council was held at Albany at the instance of the Crown to  provide the means for the defence against France in Canada, and it was  then that Franklin submitted the first concrete form for a union of the  colonies into a permanent alliance. It was in advance of the times, for,  conservative as it was, it was unfortunately opposed both by the Crown  and the colonies themselves.    The time was not ripe for any such union, and the reason was apparent.  The colonies differed very much in the character of their populations,  in the nature of their economic interests, and in their political  antecedents. They were not wholly of the English race. Many nations in  Europe had already contributed to the population. For example, New York  was partly Dutch, and in Pennsylvania there was a considerable element  of the Swedes, Germans, and Swiss. Moreover, the colonists were as  widely separated from each other, measured by the facilities of  locomotion, as are the most remote nations of the world to-day. Only a  few men ever found occasion to leave their colony to journey to another,  and most men never left, from birth to death, the community in which  they lived. Outside of the few scattered communities in the different  colonies there was an almost unbroken wilderness, with few wagon roads  and in places only a bridle path. The only methods of communication were  the letters and still fewer newspapers, which were carried by post  riders often through an almost trackless wilderness.    Obviously, a working government could not easily be constituted between  peoples of different religions, races, and economic interests, who, for  the most part, never met each other face to face and with whom frequent  communication was impossible.    The differences between the colonies and the mother-country with respect  to internal taxation slowly developed into an issue of constitutionalism  rather than of legislative policy. As in England, the immediate question  affected the power of the Crown to give to the customs inspectors the  power to make general searches and seizures, to enforce the navigation  laws. In 1761 James Otis, of Massachusetts, made a fateful speech before  the colonial legislature, in which, asserting the illegality of the  search warrants on the ground that they violated the constitutional  rights of Englishmen to protection in their own homes, he asserted that  Acts of Parliament which violated the sanctity of the home were void and  that, more specifically, they violated the charter granted to  Massachusetts. Asserting the doctrine which at that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#4)"],[1," A tingle ran through the blood of Lefty Joe. Somewhere he had heard, in  rumor, that the word of Donnegan was as good as gold. He recalled that  rumor now and something of dignity in the manner with which Donnegan  made his announcement carried a heavy weight. As a rule, the tramps  vowed with many oaths; here was one of the nights of the road who made  his bare word sufficient. And Lefty Joe heard with great wonder.    \"All I ask,\" he said, \"is why you hounded my gang, if you wasn't after  me?\"    \"I didn't hound them. I ran into Suds by accident. We had trouble. Then  Levine. Then Kennebec Lou tried to take a fall out of me.\"    A note of whimsical protest crept into the voice of Donnegan.    \"Somehow there's always a fight wherever I go,\" he said. \"Fights just  sort of grow up around me.\"    Lefty Joe snarled.    \"You didn't mean nothing by just 'happening' to run into three of my  boys one after another?\"    \"Not a thing.\"    Lefty rocked himself back and forth in an ecstasy of impatience.    \"Why don't you stay put?\" he complained. \"Why don't you stake out your  own ground and stay put in it? You cut in on every guy's territory.  There ain't any privacy any more since you hit the road. What you got? A  roving commission?\"    Donnegan waited for a moment before he answered. And when he spoke his  voice had altered. Indeed, he had remarkable ability to pitch his voice  into the roar of the freight train, and above or beneath it, and give it  a quality such as he pleased.    \"I'm following a trail, but not yours,\" he admitted at length. \"I'm  following a trail. I've been at it these two years and nothing has  come of it.\"    \"Who you after?\"    \"A man with red hair.\"    \"That tells me a lot.\"    Donnegan refused to explain.    \"What you got against him--the color of his hair?\"    And Lefty roared contentedly at his own stale jest.    \"It's no good,\" replied Donnegan. \"I'll never get on the trail.\"    Lefty broke in: \"You mean to say you've been working two solid years and  all on a trail that you ain't even found?\"    The silence answered him in the affirmative.    \"Ain't nobody been able to tip you off to him?\" went on Lefty, intensely  interested.    \"Nobody. You see, he's a hard sort to describe. Red hair, that's all  there was about him for a clue. But if any one ever saw him stripped  they'd remember him by a big blotchy birthmark on his left shoulder.\"    \"Eh?\" grunted Lefty Joe.    He added: \"What was his name?\"    \"Don't know. He changed monikers when he took to the road.\"    \"What was he to you?\"    \"A man I'm going to find.\"    \"No matter where the trail takes you?\"    \"No matter where.\"    At this Lefty was seized with unaccountable laughter. He literally  strained his lungs with that Homeric outburst. When he wiped the tears  from his eyes, at length, the shadow on the opposite side of the doorway  had disappeared. He found his companion leaning over him, and this time  he could catch the dull glint of starlight on both hair and eyes.    \"What d'you know?\" asked Donnegan.    \"How do you stand toward this bird with the birthmark and the red hair?\"  queried Lefty with caution.    \"What d'you know?\" insisted Donnegan.    All at once passion shook him; he fastened his grip in the shoulder of  the larger man, and his fingertips worked toward the bone.    \"What do you know?\" he repeated for the third time, and now there was no  hint of laughter in the hard voice of Lefty.    \"You fool, if you follow that trail you'll go to the devil. It was  Rusty Dick; and he's dead!\"    His triumphant laughter came again, but Donnegan cut into it.    \"Rusty Dick was the one you--killed!\"    \"Sure. What of it? We fought fair and square.\"    \"Then Rusty wasn't the man I want. The man I want would of eaten two  like you, Lefty.\"    \"What about the birthmark? It sure was on his shoulder; Donnegan.\"    \"Heavens!\" whispered Donnegan.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"Rusty Dick,\" gasped Donnegan. \"Yes, it must have been he.\"    \"Sure it was. What did you have against him?\"    \"It was a matter of blood--between us,\" stammered Donnegan.    His voice rose in a peculiar manner, so that Lefty shrank involuntarily.    \"You killed Rusty?\"    \"Ask any of the boys. But between you and me, it was the booze that  licked Rusty Dick. I just finished up the job and surprised everybody.\"    The train was out of the mountains and in a country of scattering hills,  but here it struck a steep grade and settled down to a grind of slow  labor; the rails hummed, and suspense filled the freight car.    \"Hey,\" cried Lefty suddenly. \"You fool, you'll do a flop out the door in  about a minute!\"    He even reached out to steady the toppling figure, but Donnegan pitched  straight out into the night. Lefty craned his neck from the door,  studying the roadbed, but at that moment the locomotive topped the  little rise and the whole train lurched forward.    \"After all,\" murmured Lefty Joe, \"it sounds like Donnegan. Hated a guy  so bad that he hadn't any use for livin' when he heard the other guy was  dead. But I'm never goin' to cross his path again, I hope.\"          5      But Donnegan had leaped clear of the roadbed, and he struck almost to  the knees in a drift of sand. Otherwise, he might well have broken his  legs with that foolhardy chance. As it was, the fall whirled him over  and over, and by the time he had picked himself up the lighted caboose  of the train was rocking past him. Donnegan watched it grow small in the  distance, and then, when it was only a red, uncertain star far down the  track, he turned to the vast country around him.    The mountains were to his right, not far away, but caught up behind the  shadows so that it seemed a great distance. Like all huge, half-seen  things they seemed in motion toward him. For the rest, he was in bare,  rolling country. The sky line everywhere was clean; there was hardly a  sign of a tree. He knew, by a little reflection, that this must be  cattle country, for the brakie had intimated as much in their talk just  before dusk. Now it was early night, and a wind began to rise, blowing  down the valley with a keen motion and a rapidly lessening temperature,  so that Donnegan saw he must get to a shelter. He could, if necessary,  endure any privation, but his tastes were for luxurious comfort.  Accordingly he considered the landscape with gloomy disapproval. He was  almost inclined to regret his plunge from the lumbering freight train.  Two things had governed him in making that move. First, when he  discovered that the long trail he followed was definitely fruitless, he  was filled with a great desire to cut himself away from his past and  make a new start. Secondly, when he learned that Rusty Dick had been  killed by Joe, he wanted desperately to get the throttle of the latter  under his thumb. If ever a man risked his life to avoid a sin, it was  Donnegan jumping from the train to keep from murder.    He stooped to sight along the ground, for this is the best way at night  and often horizon lights are revealed in this manner. But now Donnegan  saw nothing to serve as a guide. He therefore drew in his belt until it  fitted snug about his gaunt waist, settled his cap firmly, and headed  straight into the wind.    Nothing could have shown his character more distinctly.    When in doubt, head into the wind.    With a jaunty, swinging step he sauntered along, and this time, at  least, his tactics found an early reward. Topping the first large rise  of ground, he saw in the hollow beneath him the outline of a large  building. And as he approached it, the wind clearing a high blowing mist  from the stars, he saw a jumble of outlying houses. Sheds, barns,  corrals--it was the nucleus of a big ranch. It is a maxim that, if you  wish to know a man look at his library and if you wish to know a  rancher, look at his barn. Donnegan made a small detour to the left and  headed for the largest of the barns.    He entered it by the big, sliding door, which stood open; he looked up,  and saw the stars shining through a gap in the roof. And then he stood  quietly for a time, listening to the voices of the wind in the ruin.  Oddly enough, it was pleasant to Donnegan. His own troubles and sorrow  had poured upon him so thickly in the past hour or so that it was  soothing to find evidence of the distress of others. But perhaps this  meant that the entire establishment was deserted.    He left the barn and went toward the house. Not until he was close under  its wall did he come to appreciate its size. It was one of those great,  rambling, two-storied structures which the cattle kings of the past  generation were fond of building. Standing close to it, he heard none of  the intimate sounds of the storm blowing through cracks and broken  walls; no matter into what disrepair the barns had fallen, the house was  still solid; only about the edges of the building the storm kept  murmuring.    Yet there was not a light, neither above nor below. He came to the front  of the house. Still no sign of life. He stood at the door and knocked  loudly upon it, and though, when he tried the knob, he found that the  door was latched, yet no one came in response. He knocked again, and  putting his ear close he heard the echoes walk through the interior of  the building.    After this, the wind rose in sudden strength and deafened him with  rattlings; above him, a shutter was swung open and then crashed to, so  that the opening of the door was a shock of surprise to Donnegan. A dim  light from a source which he could not direct suffused the interior of  the hall; the door itself was worked open a matter of inches and  Donnegan was aware of two keen old eyes glittering out at him. Beyond  this he could distinguish nothing.    \"Who are you?\" asked a woman's voice. \"And what do you want?\"    \"I'm a stranger, and I want something to eat and a place to sleep. This  house looks as if it might have spare rooms.\"    \"Where d'you come from?\"    \"Yond"]]]
