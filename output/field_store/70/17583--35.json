Bob and Betty,  though keenly disappointed they were not to have his companionship, tried  to accept the situation as cheerfully as he did.    The packing was hastened, and soon the old farmhouse was stripped and  dismantled, the trunks stored in the Watterby attic, the furniture  carried off to the homes of those who bought it, and the key delivered  to Dave Thorne, the section foreman, who would deliver it to the  superintendent.    The hospitable Watterbys had insisted that the travelers should all stay  with them until the time for their several departures, and Bob and Betty  had a last glorious ride on Clover and the ungainly white horse while  the aunts rested and put the final touches to their preparations for  their journey.    The next morning all was bustle and hurry, for the aunts were to start on  their trip and Mr. Gordon must be off to Chicago. Miss Hope insisted on  being taken to the station an hour before their train was due, and when a  puff of steam up the track announced the actual approach of the train the  two old ladies trembled with nervousness and excitement. Mr. Gordon  guided them up the steps of the car, after a tearful farewell to Bob and  Betty, and saw that they were settled in the right sections. He spoke to  the conductor on the way out, and tipped the porter and maid liberally to  look after the travelers' comfort.          CHAPTER IV    MORE GOOD-BYES      \"They'll feel better presently,\" he remarked, rejoining Bob and Betty on  the platform. \"I know the boarding house they've chosen is fine in every  way and they're going to have a delightful winter.\"    The train started slowly, and the black silk gloves of the aunts waved  dolorously from the window. They were embarked on their adventure.    \"Don't look so solemn, Betty,\" teased her uncle. \"If I'm not mistaken  that's the smoke from my train. I don't want any one to weep over my  departure.\"    \"I could, but I won't,\" Betty assured him bravely. \"You won't get sick or  anything, will you, Uncle Dick? And you'll write to me every week?\"    \"Like a clock,\" he promised her. \"There goes the agent with my bags--this  is the local, all right. Good-bye, Bob. Remember what I've asked of you.\"    Mr. Gordon wrung Bob's hand and smiled down into the blue eyes lifted so  fervently to his.    \"You're my boy, too,\" he said clearly. \"Don't forget, lad, if you need  me.\"    Then he swept Betty into his arms.    \"Be a good girl, Sweetheart,\" he murmured, kissing her.    They watched him climb up the steps of the snorting, smoky local, saw his  bags tossed into the baggage car, and then, with a shrill grinding of  wheels, the training resumed its way. As long as they could see, the tall  figure in the gray suit stood on the platform and waved a white  handkerchief to them.    \"Oh, Bob, don't let me cry,\" begged Betty, in a sudden panic.  \"Everybody's watching us. Let's go somewhere, quick.\"    \"All right, we will,\" promised Bob. \"We'll take the car to Doctor  Morrison. Hop in, Betsey, and dry your eyes. You're going traveling  yourself day after to-morrow.\"    \"I wasn't really crying,\" explained Betty as she settled herself in the  shabby car that had belonged to her uncle; he had sold it to the town  physician. \"But doesn't it give you a lonesome feeling to be the one  that's left? I hate to say good-bye, anyway.\"    Bob's experience with motors was rather limited, and what slight  knowledge he possessed had been gained in a few lessons taken while  riding with Mr. Gordon. However, the boy was sure that he could drive the  car the brief distance to the doctor's house, and Betty shared his  confidence. From the Morrison house it was only a short walk to the  Watterby farm, where they were to stay until they left for the East.    Betty forgot to cry as Bob started the car so suddenly that it shot  forward like a live thing. He jammed on the brake and brought it to a  standstill so abruptly that Betty came very near to pitching through the  windshield.    \"Couldn't you do it--er--more gently?\" she hinted delicately.    \"Hold fast and I'll try,\" grinned Bob. \"As a chauffeur I'd be a  good iceman.\"    The second time he managed better, and the battered little car moved off  with less disturbing results.    In a very few minutes they had reached Doctor Morrison's garage.    The doctor urged Bob and Betty strongly to stay to supper with him and  promised beaten biscuit and honey, but although they knew the skill of  his old Southern cook very well, they had promised Grandma Watterby to be  there for supper and such a promise could not be disregarded.    \"Well, anyway,\" said Betty soothingly, as they walked on toward the  Watterby farm, \"when we ride Clover and Reuben up to the fields we won't  have to worry about how to make them go.\"    \"No, that's so,\" agreed Bob. \"But, Betty, I hate to think of giving up  Reuben. He isn't much to look at, but he has been a mighty good horse.\"    \"I'd feel worse,\" declared Betty, \"if we had to sell them to strangers.  We wouldn't know how they would be treated then. Now we are sure they  will be cared for and petted and they won't miss us.\"    Reuben and Clover, Mr. Gordon had said, were to be disposed of as Betty  and Bob chose. The horses were theirs to give away or sell as they  preferred. Bob had instantly decided to give his mount to Dave Thorne,  the section foreman, who had shown him many kindnesses and who was  delighted to get a trained saddle horse. Horses were very scarce in that  section of the country, and Mr. Gordon had gone to considerable trouble  to get these.    Betty had elected to give Clover to the new superintendent's daughter,  the girl who was to move with her parents into the old Saunders  farmhouse. Betty had never seen her, but knew she was about fourteen or  fifteen and eager to learn to ride.    The day before they were to start for Washington, Bob and Betty rode the  horses up to the oil fields and gave them into the charge of Dave  Thorne. The superintendent was already on the ground but his family and  furniture were not due for a week.    Clover and Reuben bore the parting better than their young mistress and  master, and Betty was glad when all the good-byes had been said and they  stepped into the Watterby car which Mrs. Watterby had driven up for them.  The fields were about eight miles from her house.    \"You'll be happier when once you're on the train, Betty,\" said good Mrs.  Watterby, glancing swiftly at Betty's clouded face, \"This going around  saying good-bye to people and things is enough to break anybody up. Now  to-morrow me and mother won't weep a tear over you--you'll see. We're  glad you're going to school to have a good time with all those young  folks. Now what's that Chinaman want?\"    Lee Chang came running from the bunk house, waving something tied in  white paper.    \"Apple tart, Miss Betty!\" he called imploringly. \"Velly nice apple  tart--maybe the cook at that school no make good tarts.\"    Betty took the package and thanked him warmly and they drove on.    \"People are so good to me,\" choked the girl. \"I never knew I had so  many friends.\"    \"Well, that's nothing to cry over,\" advised Bob philosophically. \"You  ought to be glad. Do I get a crumb of the tart, Betsey?\"    He spoke with a purpose and was rewarded by seeing Betty's own sunny  smile come out.    \"You always do,\" she told him. \"But wait till we get home. I want Ki to  have a piece, too.\"    Ki, it developed, when they reached the Watterby farm, had been busy with  farewell plans of his own.    \"For you,\" he announced gravely to Bob, handing him an immense hunting  knife as he stepped out of the car.    \"For you,\" he informed Betty with equal gravity, presenting her a little  silver nugget.    They both thanked him repeatedly, and he stalked off, carrying his piece  of the apple tart and apparently assured of their sincerity.    \"Though what he expects me to do with a hunting knife is more than I can  guess,\" laughed Bob.          CHAPTER V    A REGULAR CROSS-PATCH      \"Be sure you send me a postal from Washington. I never knew anybody from  there before,\" said Grandma Watterby earnestly.    \"And don't get off the train unless you know how long it's going to  stop,\" advised Will Watterby.    \"Do you think you ate enough breakfast?\" his wife asked anxiously.    Bob and Betty were waiting for the Eastern Limited, and the Watterby  family, who had brought them to the station, were waiting, too. The  Limited stopped only on signal, and this was no every day occurrence.    \"We'll be all right,\" said Bob earnestly. \"You can look for a postal from  Chicago first, Grandma.\"    Then came the usual hurried good-byes, the kisses and handshakes and the  repeated promises to \"write soon.\" Then Bob and Betty found themselves in  the sleeper, waving frantically to the little group on the platform as  the Limited slowly got under way.    \"And that's the last of Flame City--for some time at least,\"  observed Bob.    Betty, who had made excellent use of lessons learned in her few previous  long journeys, took off her hat and gloves and placed them in a paper bag  which Bob put in the rack for her.    \"I did want a new hat so much,\" she sighed, looking rather  enviously at the woman across the aisle who wore a smart Fall hat  that was unmistakably new. \"But Flame City depends on mail order  hats and I thought it safer to wait till I could see what people  are really wearing.\"    \"You look all right,\" said Bob loyally. \"What's that around that woman's  neck--fur? Why I'm so hot I can hardly breathe.\"    \"It's mink,\" Betty informed him with superiority. \"Isn't it beautiful? I  wanted a set, but Uncle Dick said mink was too old for me. He did say,  though, that I can have a neckpiece made from that fox skin Ki gave me.\"    \"Don't see why you want to tie yourself up like an Eskimo,\" grumbled  Bob. \"Well, we seem to be headed toward the door marked 'Education,'  don't we, Betsey?\"    They exchanged a smile of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#4)"],[1,"him on the ground,  but his legs buckled under him, and he fell forward on his face. Any  of the three could have saved him, but the spectacle of the terrible  old man's helplessness benumbed their senses and their muscles.    \"Carry me in!\" said Bill at last.    Bull lifted him and bore him gingerly through the door and placed him  on the bunk. The light revealed a grisly spectacle. Crimson stains and  dirt literally covered him; his left leg was bandaged below the knee;  his right shoulder was roughly splinted with small twigs and  swathed in cloth.    The long ride, with his legs tied in place, had apparently paralyzed  his nerves below the hips. He remained crushed against the wall, his  legs falling in the odd position in which they were put down by Bull.  It was illustrative of his character that, even in this crisis, not  one of the three dared venture an expression of sympathy, a question,  a suggestion.    Crumpled against the wall, his head bowed forward and cramped, the  stern old man still controlled them with the upward glance of his eyes  through the shag of eyebrows.    \"Gimme my pipe,\" he commanded.    Three hands reached for it--pipe, tobacco, matches were proffered to  him. Before he accepted the articles he swept their faces with a  glance of satisfaction. Without attempting to change the position  which must have been torturing him, he filled the pipe bowl, his  fingers moving as if he had partially lost control of them. He filled  it raggedly, shreds of tobacco hanging down around the bowl. He bent  his head to meet the left hand which he raised with difficulty, then  he tried to light a match. But he seemed incapable of moving the  sulphur head fast enough to bring it to a light with friction. Match  after match crumbled as he continued his efforts.    \"Here, lemme light a match for you, Dad!\"    Harry's offer was received with a silent curling of the lips and a  glint of the yellow teeth beneath that made him step back. The old man  continued his work. There were a dozen wrecked matches before the  blood began to stir in his numbed arm and he was able to light the  match and the pipe. He drew several breaths of the smoke deep into his  lungs. For the moment the savage, hungry satisfaction changed his  face; they could tell by that alteration what agonies he had been  suffering before.    Presently he frowned and set about changing his position with infinite  labor. The left leg was helpless, and so was the right arm. Yet, after  much labor, he managed to stuff a roll of the blankets into the corner  and then shift himself until his back rested against this support. But  his strength deserted him again. His pipe was dropped down in the left  hand, his head sagged back.    Still they dared not approach him. His two sons stood about, shifting  from one foot to another, as if they expected a blow to descend upon  them at any moment, as if each labored movement of terrible old Bill  Campbell caused them the agony which he must be suffering.    As for Bull Hunter, he sat again on the floor, his chin dropped upon  his great fist, and wondered for a time at his uncle. It was the  second great event to him, all in one day. First he had discovered  that by fighting a thing, one can actually conquer. Second, he  discovered that great fighter, his uncle, had been beaten. The  impossible had happened twice between one sunrise and sunset.    But men and the affairs of men could not hold his eye overlong.  Presently he dropped his head again and was deep in the pages of his  book. At length Bill Campbell heaved up his head. It was to glare into  the scared faces of his sons.    \"How long are you goin' to keep me waiting for food?\"    The order snapped them into action. They sprang here and there, and  presently the thick slices of bacon were hissing on the pan, and the  clouds of bacon smoke wafted through the cabin. When they reached Bill  Campbell he blinked. Pain had given him a maddening appetite, yet he  puffed steadily on his pipe and said nothing.    The tin plate of potatoes and bacon was shoved before him, and the big  tin cup of coffee. The three younger men sat in silence and devoured  their own meal; the two sons swiftly, but Bull Hunter fell into  musings, and part of his food remained uneaten. Then his glance  wandered to his uncle and saw a thing to wonder at--a horrible thing  in its own way.    The nerveless left hand of the mountaineer, which had barely possessed  steadiness to light a match, was far too inaccurate to handle a fork;  and Bull saw his uncle stuffing his mouth with his fingers and daring  the others to watch him.    Something like pity came to Bull. It was so rare an emotion to connect  with human beings that he hardly recognized it, for men and women, as  he knew them, were brilliant, clever creatures, perfectly at home in  the midst of difficulties that appalled him. But, as he watched the  old man feed himself like an animal, the emotion that rose in Bull was  the sadness he felt when he watched old Maggie stumbling among the  rocks. There was something wrong with the forelegs of Maggie, and she  was only half a horse when it came to going downhill on broken ground.  He had always thought of the great strength that once must have been  hers, and he pitied her for the change. He found himself pitying Uncle  Bill Campbell in much the same way.    When Bill raised his tin cup he spilled scalding coffee on his breast.  The old man merely set his teeth and continued to glare his challenge  at the three. But not one of the three dared speak a word, dared make  an offer of assistance.    What baffled the slow mind of Bull Hunter was the effort to imagine a  force so great that battle with it had reduced the invincible Campbell  to this shaken wreck of his old self. Mere bullets could tear wounds  in flesh and break bones; but mere bullets could not wreck the nerves  of a man so that his hand trembled as if he were drunk or hysterical  with weariness.    He tried to work out this problem. He conceived a man of gigantic  size, vast muscles, inexhaustible strength. The power of a bear and  the swift cunning of a wild cat--such must have been the man who  struck down Uncle Bill and sent him home a shattered remnant of  his old self.    There was another mystery. Why did the destroyer not finish his task?  Why did he take pity on Uncle Bill Campbell and bind up the wounds he  had himself made? Here the mind of Bull Hunter paused. He could not  pass the mysterious idea of another than himself pitying Uncle Bill.  It was pitying a hawk in the sky.    Harry was taking away the dishes and throwing them in the little tub  of lukewarm water where the grease would be carelessly soused  off them.    \"Did you get up that stump?\" asked Uncle Bill suddenly.    There was a familiar ring in his voice. Woe to them if they had not  carried out his orders! All three of the young men quaked, and Bull  laid aside his book.    \"We done it,\" answered Joe in a quavering voice.    \"You done it?\" asked Bill.    \"We--we dug her pretty well clear, then Bull pulled her up.\"    Some of the wrath ebbed out of the face of Bill as he glanced at the  huge form of Bull. \"Stand up!\" he ordered.    Bull arose.    The keen eye of the old man went over him from head to foot slowly.  \"Someday,\" he said slowly, speaking entirely to himself.  \"Someday--maybe!\"    What he expected from Bull \"someday\" remained unknown. The dishwashing  was swiftly finished. Then Uncle Bill made a feeble effort to get off  his boots, but his strength had been ebbing for some time. His sons  dared not interfere as the old man leaned slowly over and strove to  tug the boot from his wounded leg; but Bull remembered, all in a flood  of tenderness, some half-dozen small, kind things that his uncle had  said to him.    That was long, long ago, when the orphan came into the Campbell  family. In those days his stupidity had been attributed largely to the  speed with which he had grown, and he was expected to become normally  bright later on; and in those days Bill Campbell occasionally let fall  some gentle word to the great boy with his big, frightened eyes. And  the half-dozen instances came back to Bull in this moment.    He stepped between his cousins and laid his hand on the foot of his  uncle. It brought a snarl from the old man, a snarl that made Bull  straighten and step back, but he came again and put aside the shaking  hand of Uncle Bill. His cousins stood at one side, literally quaking.  It was the first time that they had actually seen their father defied.  They saw the huge hand of Bull settle around the leg of their father,  well below the wound and then the grip closed to avoid the danger of  opening the wound when the boot was worked off. After this he pulled  the tight riding boot slowly from the swollen foot.    Uncle Bill was no longer silent. The moment the big hand of his nephew  closed over his leg he launched a stream of curses that chilled the  blood and drove his own sons farther back into the shadow of the  corner. He demanded that they stand forth and tear Bull limb from  limb. He disinherited them for cowardice. He threatened Bull with a  vengeance compared with which the thunderbolt would be a feeble flare  of light. He swore that he was entirely capable of taking care of  himself, that he would step down into his grave sooner than be nursed  and petted by any living human being.    All the while, the great Bull leaned impassively over the wounded man  and finally worked the boot free. That was not all. Uncle Bill had  slipped over until he could reach a billet of wood beside his bunk. He  struck at Bull's head with it, but the stick was brushed out of his  palsied fingers with a single gesture, and, while Uncle Bill groaned  with fury and impotence, Bull continued the task of preparing him for  bed. He straightened the old body of the terrible Campbell; he heated  water in the tub and washed away stains"]]]
