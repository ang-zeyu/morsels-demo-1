[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#3)"],[1,"eppes_, roll away in  monotonous undulations to the cloudy barrier of Mount Atlas which closes  the horizon. And this rough and melancholy plain in its turn offers a  striking contrast with the coast region of Boujeiah and Hippo, which is not  unlike the Italian Campania in its mellowness and gaiety. Such clear-cut  differences between the various parts of the same province doubtless  explain the essential peculiarities of the Numidian character. The bishop  Augustin, who carried his pastoral cross from one end to the other of this  country, and was its acting and thinking soul, may perhaps have owed to it  the contrasts and many-sidedness of his own rich nature.    Of course, Thagaste did not pretend to be a capital. It was a free-town of  the second or third order; but its distance from the great centres gave it  a certain importance. The neighbouring free-towns, Thubursicum, Thagura,  were small. Madaura and Theveste, rather larger, had not perhaps the same  commercial importance. Thagaste was placed at the junction of many Roman  roads. There the little Augustin, with other children of his age, would  have a chance to admire the out-riders and equipages of the Imperial  Mail, halted before the inns of the town. What we can be sure of is that  Thagaste, then as now, was a town of passage and of traffic, a half-way  stopping-place for the southern and coast towns, as well as for those of  the Proconsulate and Numidia. And like the present Souk-Ahras, Thagaste  must have been above all a market. Bread-stuffs and Numidian wines were  bartered for the flocks of the Aures, leather, dates, and the esparto  basket-work of the regions of Sahara. The marbles of Simitthu, the  citron-wood of which they made precious tables, were doubtless handled  there. The neighbouring forests could furnish building materials to the  whole country. Thagaste was the great mart of woodland Numidia, the  warehouse and the bazaar, where to this day the nomad comes to lay in a  stock of provisions, and stares with childish delight at the fine things  produced by the inventive talent of the workers who live in towns.    Thus images of plenty and joy surrounded the cradle of Augustin. The smile  of Latin beauty welcomed him also from his earliest steps. It is true that  Thagaste was not what is called a fine city. The fragments of antiquity  which have been unearthed there are of rather inferior workmanship. But how  little is needed to give wings to the imagination of an intelligent child!  At all events, Thagaste had a bathing-hall paved with mosaics and perhaps  ornamented with statues; Augustin used to bathe there with his father.  And again, it is probable that, like the neighbouring Thubursicum and  other free-cities of the same level, it had its theatre, its forum, its  nymph-fountains, perhaps even its amphitheatre. Of all that nothing  has been found. Certain inscribed stone tablets, capitals and shafts  of columns, a stone with an inscription which belonged to a Catholic  church--that is all which has been discovered up to this present time.    Let us not ask for the impossible. Thagaste had columns--nay, perhaps a  whole street between a double range of columns, as at Thimgad. That would  be quite enough to delight the eyes of a little wondering boy. A column,  even injured, or scarcely cleansed from wrack and rubbish, has about it  something impressive. It is like a free melody singing among the heavy  masses of the building. To this hour, in our Algerian villages, the mere  sight of a broken column entrances and cheers us--a white ghost of beauty  streaming up from the ruins among the modern hovels.    There were columns at Thagaste.          II    THE FAMILY OF A SAINT      It was in this pleasant little town, shaded and beautified for many years  now by the arts of Rome, that the parents of Augustin lived.    His father, Patricius, affords us a good enough type of the Romanized  African. He belonged to the order of _Decuriones_, to the \"very brilliant  urban council of Thagaste\" (_splendidissimus ordo Thagastensis_), as an  inscription at Souk-Ahras puts it. Although these strong epithets may be  said to be part of the ordinary official phraseology, they indicate, just  the same, the importance which went with such a position. In his township,  Patricius was a kind of personage. His son assures us that he was poor, but  we may suspect the holy bishop of exaggerating through Christian humility.  Patricius must certainly have owned more than twenty-five acres of land,  for this was made a condition of being elected to the _curia_. He had  vineyards and orchards, of which Augustin later on recalled the plentiful  and sweet-tasting fruits. In short, he lived in considerable style. It  is true that in Africa household expenses have never at any time been a  great extravagance. Still, the sons of Patricius had a pedagogue, a slave  specially engaged to keep them under his eye, like all the children of  families comfortably off.    It has been said that as Augustin's father was a member of the _curia_,  he must have been a ruined man. The Decurions, who levied taxes and made  themselves responsible for their collection, were obliged to supply any  deficiency in the revenue out of their own money. Patricius, it is thought,  must have been one of the numerous victims of this disastrous system. But  no doubt there were a good many exceptions. Besides, there is nothing in  Augustin's reminiscences which authorizes us to believe that his father  ever knew embarrassment, to say nothing of actual poverty. What seems by  far the most probable is that he lived as well as he could upon the income  of his estate as a small country landowner. In Africa people are satisfied  with very little. Save for an unusually bad year following a time of long  drought, or a descent of locusts, the land always gives forth enough to  feed its master.    To hunt, to ride horseback, now and then to go on parade, to look after  his small-holders and agricultural slaves, to drive one of those bargains  in which African cunning triumphs--such were the employments of Patricius.  In short, he drifted through life on his little demesne. Sometimes this  indolent man was overcome by a sudden passion for work; or again he was  seized by furious rages. He was violent and brutal. At such moments he  struck out right and left. He would even have hit his wife or flogged the  skin off her back if the quietude of this woman, her dignity and Christian  mildness, had not overawed him. Let us not judge this kind of conduct by  our own; we shall never understand it. The ancient customs, especially the  African customs, were a disconcerting mixture of intense refinement and  heedless brutality.    That is why it will not do to exaggerate the outbursts of Patricius, which  his son mentions discreetly. Although he may not have been very faithful to  his wife, that was in those days, more than in ours, a venial sin in the  eyes of the world. At heart the African has always longed for a harem in  his house; he inclines naturally to the polygamy of Muslemism. In Carthage,  and elsewhere, public opinion was full of indulgence for the husband who  allowed himself liberties with the serving-women. People laughed at it, and  excused the man. It is true they were rather harder on the matron who took  the same kind of liberty with her men-slaves. However, that went on too.  The Bishop of Hippo, in his sermons, strongly rebuked the Christian married  couples for these frequent adulteries which were scarcely regarded as  errors.    Patricius was a pagan, and this partly explains his laxity. It would  doubtless be going too far to say that he remained faithful to paganism  all his life. It is not likely that this urban councillor of Thagaste was  a particularly assured pagan. Speculative and intellectual considerations  made a very moderate appeal to him. He was not an arguer like his son. He  was pagan from habit, from that instinctive conservatism of the citizen  and landowner who sticks obstinately to his class and family traditions.  Prudence and diplomacy had also something to do with it. Many great  landlords continued to defend and practise paganism, probably from motives  similar to those of Patricius himself. As for him, he had no desire to get  wrong with the important and influential people of the country; he might  have need of their protection to save his small property from the ravenous  public treasury. Moreover, the best-paid posts were still controlled by the  pagan priesthood. And so Augustin's father thought himself very wise in  dealing cautiously with a religion which was always so powerful, and  rewarded its adherents so well.    But for all that, it is undeniable that paganism about this time was in an  awkward position from a political point of view. The Government eyed it  with disapproval. Since the death of Constantine, the \"accursed emperors\"  had waged against it a furious war. In 353, just before the birth of  Augustin, Constantius promulgated an edict renewing the order for the  closing of the temples and the abolition of sacrifices--and that too under  pain of death and confiscation. But in distant provinces, such as Numidia,  the action of the central power was slow and irregular. It was often  represented by officials who were hostile or indifferent to Christianity.  The local aristocracy and their following scoffed at it more or less  openly. In their immense villas, behind the walls of their parks, the rich  landowners offered sacrifices and organized processions and feasts as  if there were no law at all. Patricius knew all that. And, on the other  side, he could take note of the encroachments of the new religion. During  the first half of the fourth century Thagaste had been conquered by the  Donatists. Since the edict of Constans against these schismatics, the  inhabitants of the little city had come back to Catholicism out of fear of  the severity of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#3)"],[1,"action, the plausible plea  of Marcellus Eprius against the honest attack of Helvidius Priscus, and  the burning rebukes of the intrepid Vocula to his cowardly and  treacherous followers--all these, in the Histories, show no ordinary  degree of rhetorical skill and versatility. Indeed, the entire body of  his works is animated with the spirit of the orator, as it is tinged also  with the coloring of the poet. For this reason, they are doubtless  deficient in the noble simplicity of the earlier classical histories; but  for the same reason they may be a richer treasure for the professional  men at least of modern times.    Of his marriage with the daughter of Agricola, and its influence on his  character and prospects, as also of his passing in regular gradation  through the series of public honors at Rome, beginning with the  quaestorship under Vespasian, and ending with the consulship under Nerva,  Tacitus informs us himself (A. 9, His. i. 1), barely alluding to them,  however, in the general, and leaving all the details to mere conjecture.  We learn to our surprise, that he not only escaped the jealousy of the  tyrant Domitian, but was even promoted by him to the office of  Quindecimvir and Praetor (Ann. ii. 11). Beyond these vague notices, we  know little or nothing of his course of life, except that Pliny says  (Epist. iv. 13), he was much esteemed by the learned and the great at  Rome, who went in crowds to his levees. Of the time of his death, we can  only conjecture, that he died before the Emperor Trajan, but after his  friend Pliny--the former, because, had he outlived the Emperor, he would  probably have executed his purpose of writing the history of his reign  (His. i. 1); the latter, because, if he had not survived his friend,  Pliny, who lamented the death of so many others, would not have failed to  pay the last tribute to the memory of Tacitus.    It is generally admitted, though without direct testimony, that Tacitus  died not without issue. That excellent prince, M. Claudius Tacitus,  deduced his pedigree from the historian, and ordered his image to be set  up, and a complete collection of his works to be placed in the public  archives, with a special direction that twelve copies should be made  every year at the public expense. It is greatly to be regretted that such  praiseworthy precautions should have failed to preserve for us that  treasure entire!    The age of Tacitus is usually styled the silver age of Roman Literature;  and it merits no higher title, when compared with the golden age of  Augustus. It was the good fortune of Augustus to gain the supremacy at  Rome, when society had reached its maximum of refinement, and was just  ready to enter upon its stage of corruption and decline. Hence his name  is identified with that proud era in literature, in producing which he  bore at best only an accidental and secondary part. In the literature of  the Augustan age, we admire the substance of learning and philosophy  without the show, the cultivation of taste without the parade of  criticism, the fascination of poetry without its corruption, and the use  of eloquence without its abuse. Grecian refinement was no longer  despised; Grecian effeminacy had not yet prevailed. The camp was not now  the home of the Romans; neither were the theatres and the schools. They  had ceased to be a nation of soldiers, and had not yet become a nation of  slaves. At no other period could Rome have had her Cicero, her Livy, and  her Virgil.    The silver age produced no men who \"attained unto these first three.\" But  there are not wanting other bright names to associate with Tacitus,  though most of them lived a little earlier than he. There was Seneca, the  Philosopher, whose style, with its perpetual antitheses, is the very  worst of the age, but his sentiments, perhaps more or less under the  influence of Christianity, approach nearer to the Christian code of  morals than those of any other Latin author. There were Martial and  Juvenal, whose satires made vice tremble in its high places, and helped  to confer on the Romans the honor of originating one species of literary  composition, unknown to the Greeks. There were Suetonius and Plutarch;  the one natural, simple, and pure in his style, far beyond his age, but  without much depth or vigor of thought; the other involved and affected  in his manner, but in his matter of surpassing richness and incalculable  worth. There was the elder Pliny, a prodigy of learning and industry,  whose researches in Natural History cost him his life, in that fatal  eruption of Vesuvius which buried Herculaneum and Pompeii. There was also  the judicious Quintilian, at once neat and nervous in his language,  delicate and correct in his criticisms, a man of genius and a scholar, a  teacher and an exemplar of eloquence. Finally, there were the younger  Pliny and Tacitus, rival candidates for literary and professional  distinction, yet cherishing for each other the most devoted and  inviolable attachment, each viewing the other as the ornament of their  country, each urging the other to write the history of their age, and  each relying chiefly on the genius of the other for his own immortality  (Plin. Epis. vii. 33). Their names were together identified by their  contemporaries with the literature of the age of Trajan: \"I never was  touched with a more sensible pleasure,\" says Pliny, in one of his  beautiful Letters [Eleven of these are addressed to Tacitus, and two  or three are written expressly for the purpose of furnishing materials  for his history.] (which rival Cicero's in epistolary ease and  elegance), \"than by an account which I lately received from Cornelius  Tacitus. He informed me, that at the last Circensian Games, he sat next  a stranger, who, after much discourse on various topics of learning,  asked him whether he was an Italian or a Provincial. Tacitus replied,  'Your acquaintance with literature must have informed you who I am.'  'Aye,' said the man, 'is it then Tacitus or Pliny I am talking with?' I  cannot express how highly I am pleased to find, that our names are not  so much the proper appellations of individuals, as a designation of  learning itself\" (Plin. Epis. ix. 23). Critics are not agreed to which  of these two literary friends belongs the delicate encomium of  Quintilian, when, after enumerating the principal writers of the day,  he adds, \"There is another ornament of the age, who will deserve the  admiration of posterity. I do not mention him at present; his name will  be known hereafter.\" Pliny, Tacitus, and Quintilian, are also rival  candidates for the honor of having written the Dialogue de Claris  Oratoribus, one of the most valuable productions in ancient criticism.    As a writer, Tacitus was not free from the faults of his age. The native  simplicity of Greek and Latin composition had passed away. An affected  point and an artificial brilliancy were substituted in their place. The  rhetoric and philosophy of the schools had infected all the departments  of literature. Simple narrative no longer suited the pampered taste of  the readers or the writers of history. It must be highly seasoned with  sentimentalism and moralizing, with romance and poetry. Tacitus,  certainly, did not escape the infection. In the language of Macaulay, \"He  carries his love of effect far beyond the limits of moderation. He tells  a fine story finely, but he cannot tell a plain story plainly. He  stimulates, till stimulants lose their power.\" [See a fine article on  history, Ed. Her., 1828. Also in Macaulay's Miscellanies.] We have taken  occasion in the notes to point out not a few examples of rhetorical  pomp, and poetical coloring, and even needless multiplication of words,  where plainness and precision would have been much better, and which  may well surprise us in a writer of so much conciseness. Lord Monboddo,  in a very able, though somewhat extravagant critique on Tacitus, has  selected numerous instances of what he calls the ornamented dry style,  many of which are so concise, so rough, and so broken, that he says,  they do not deserve the name of composition, but seem rather like the  raw materials of history, than like history itself (Orig. and Prog.  of Lang., vol iii. chap. 12).    Still, few readers can fail to pronounce Tacitus, as Macaulay affirms,  and even Lord Monboddo admits him to be, the greatest of Latin  historians, superior to Thucydides himself in the moral painting of his  best narrative scenes, and in the delineation of character without a  rival among historians, with scarcely a superior among dramatists and  novelists. The common style of his narrative is, indeed, wanting in  simplicity, and sometimes in perspicuity. He does not deal enough in the  specific and the picturesque, the where, the when and the how. But when  his subject comes up to the grandeur of his conceptions, and the strength  of his language, his descriptions are graphic and powerful. No battle  scenes are more grand and terrific than those of Tacitus. Military men  and scholars have also remarked their singular correctness and  definiteness. The military evolutions, the fierce encounter, the doubtful  struggle, the alternations of victory and defeat, the disastrous rout and  hot pursuit, the carnage and blood, are set forth with the warrior's  accuracy and the poet's fire; while, at the same time, the conflicting  passions and emotions of the combatants are discerned, as it were, by the  eye of a seer--their hidden springs of action, and the lowest depths of  their hearts laid bare, as if by the wand of a magician. In the painting  of large groups, in the moral portraiture of vast bodies of men under  high excitement and in strenuous exertion, we think that Tacitus far  surpasses all other historians. Whether it be a field of battle or a  captured city, a frightened senate or a flattering court, a mutiny or a  mob, that he describes, we not only see in a"]]]
