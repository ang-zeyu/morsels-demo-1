The sun was near setting at the time Cape Byron bore west, three or four  miles; and the coast from thence to Point Look-out having been seen by  captain Cook, we steered off in order to avoid falling in with the reefs  of Point Danger in the night. At eleven, hauled more in for the land; and  at eight next day [MONDAY 26 JULY 1802], Mount Warning was set at S. 25 deg.  W., twenty leagues. On coming in with Point Look-out, I took observations  for the latitude and longitude, which fixed it in 27 deg. 27' south, and 153 deg.  31' east. The latitude is the same as it had been made in the Norfolk,  (Introd. Vol. I), but is 19' south, and 3' west of the situation given in  captain Cook's chart. The bearings of the land at noon were,      Point Look-out, distant 3 leagues,   S.  9 deg. W.  Moreton entrance to Glass-house Bay, S. 55  W.  Cape Moreton, distant six leagues,   N. 18  W.      A strange vessel seen to the southward, had induced me to carry little  sail all the morning; it was now perceived not to be the Lady Nelson, but  probably one of the two whalers known to be fishing off the coast; we  therefore made sail for Cape Moreton, and came up with it at four  o'clock. I was much surprised to see a small, but dangerous reef lying  between four and five miles off this cape to the north-east, which had  not been noticed in the Norfolk; in entering Glass-house Bay I had then  hauled close round Cape Moreton at dusk in the evening, and in coming out  had passed too far westward to observe it. The longitude of Cape Moreton  was now fixed by the time keepers at 153 deg. 261/2' east, differing only 11/2'  from the lunar observations before taken in the Norfolk; when its  latitude had been settled at 27 deg. 01/2' south.    (Atlas, Plate X.)    TUESDAY 27 JULY 1802    After passing the dangerous reef, we steered northward until three in the  morning; and then hove to until daylight, for the purpose of examining  the land about Double-island Point and Wide Bay, which did not appear to  have been well distinguished by captain Cook. At seven o'clock the point  bore N. 2 deg. W., six leagues, and the shore abreast, a beach with sandy  hills behind it, was distant six miles. Between the S. 63. W. and a low  bluff head bearing S. 32 deg. W., was a bight in the coast where the sand  hills seemed to terminate; for the back land further south was high and  rocky with small peaks on the top, similar to the ridge behind the Glass  Houses, of which it is probably a continuation.    At half past nine we hauled close round Double-island Point, within a  rock lying between one and two miles to the N. N. E., having 7 fathoms  for the least water. The point answered captain Cook's description: it is  a steep head, at the extremity of a neck of land which runs out two miles  from the main, and lies in 25 deg. 56' south, and 153 deg. 13' east. On the north  side of the point the coast falls back to the westward, and presents a  steep shore of white sand; but in curving round Wide Bay the sandy land  becomes very low, and a small opening was seen in it, leading to a piece  of water like a lagoon; but the shoals which lie off the entrance render  it difficult of access, if indeed there be a passage for any thing larger  than boats. Had the Lady Nelson been with me, I should have attempted to  get her into the lagoon, having previously entertained a conjecture that  the head of Hervey's Bay might communicate with Wide Bay; but the  apprehension that lieutenant Murray would arrive at the first rendezvous,  and proceed to the next before we could join him, deterred me from  attempting it with the Investigator or with boats.    Upon the north side of the opening there was a number of Indians, fifty  as reported, looking at the ship, and near Double-island Point ten others  had been seen, implying a more numerous population than is usual to the  southward. I inferred from hence, that the piece of water at the head of  Wide Bay was extensive and shallow; for in such places the natives draw  much subsistence from the fish which there abound, and are more easily  caught than in deep water. So far as could be seen from the mast head at  three or four miles off, the water extended about five miles westward, to  the feet of some hills covered with small wood. Its extent north and  south could not be distinguished, and it seemed probable that one, and  perhaps two streams fall into it; for there were many large medusas  floating at the entrance, such as are usually found near the mouths of  rivers in this country.    We passed the shoals of Wide Bay in from 12 to 5 fathoms water; and  steered northward at the distance of six, and from that to two miles off  the shore, until dark. Captain Cook describes this part of the coast as  moderately high and very barren; there being great patches of moveable  sand many acres in extent, through which appeared in some places the  green tops of trees half buried, and in others the naked trunks of such  as the sand had destroyed. We sailed some miles nearer to it than the  Endeavour had done, and saw extensive, bare patches in many parts; but  nothing to indicate the sands being moveable; and in general, there were  shrubs, bushes, and some trees scattered over the hills in front of the  sea. Nothing however can well be imagined more barren than this  peninsula; but the smokes which arose from many parts, corroborated the  remark made upon the population about Wide Bay; and bespoke that fresh  water was not scarce in this sandy country.    Our course at night was directed by the fires on the shore, and the wind  being moderate from the south-westward, it was continued until ten  o'clock; after which we stood off and on till daylight [WEDNESDAY 28 JULY  1802], and then had Indian Head bearing S. 54 deg. W. one mile and a half.  This head was so named by captain Cook, from the great number of Indians  assembled there in 1770. Mr. Westall's sketch of it (Atlas, Plate XVIII,  View 4.), taken as we steered close along the shore for Sandy Cape, will  show that the same sterility prevailed here as in the southern part of  the peninsula; and it continued to the northern extremity.    At eleven o'clock we reached Sandy Cape, and the master was sent ahead to  sound in a small passage through Break-sea Spit. The ship followed under  easy sail, until we got into 3 fathoms; and the master not making the  signal for any deeper water, I tacked and called the boat on board. The  channel appeared to go quite through the Spit, into Hervey's Bay; but as  there were, in many parts, not more than 2 fathoms, it can be passed only  by small vessels. At noon,      Sandy Cape, distant a miles, bore S. 64 deg. to 80 deg. W.  Indian Head, distant 7 leagues,          S. 12  E.      Our observations fixed Sandy Cape in 24 deg. 42' south, and 153 deg.' 16' east,  being 3' north, and 7' east of the position assigned to it by captain  Cook.    [EAST COAST. HERVEY'S BAY.]    At one o'clock we steered northward, close to the edge of Break-sea Spit,  searching for a passage through it into Hervey's Bay. There were many  small winding channels amongst the breakers, and a larger being perceived  at three, the boat was sent to make an examination; in the mean time, the  wind having shifted to north-west and become very light, we dropped the  stream anchor two miles from the Spit, in 11 fathoms, fine grey sand. The  channel where the boat was sounding, and out of which a tide came of more  than one mile an hour, bore W. by N.1/2 N., and Sandy Cape S. 24 deg. to 41 deg.  W., about three leagues.    Soon after sunset the master returned, and reported the channel to be  nearly a mile and a half wide, and that it went quite through to the bay;  but it did not generally contain more than fourteen feet water, and was  therefore impassable for the Investigator. The bottom of this, and of the  former small channel, as also the shoaler banks of the Spit, were of  coral, mixed with coral sand.    THURSDAY 29 JULY 1802    At three in the morning, on a breeze springing up at S. W. by S., we  stretched south-eastward; and a vessel having been observed over night  off Indian Head, this tack was prolonged till seven o'clock; when seeing  nothing of her, we stood back for the Spit, and coasted close along its  east side as before, in from 10 to 5 fathoms water. At forty minutes  after noon we passed over the tail of the Spit, in latitude 24 deg. 24'; the  water then deepening suddenly from 6 and 7, to 22 fathoms, and the white  patches on Sandy Cape bearing S. 8 deg. E. In standing N. W. by W. we crossed  a bank in 11 fathoms, and on tacking, passed another part of it with only  5; the water upon it was not discoloured, nor had it been observed either  by captain Cook, or by me in the Norfolk: it lies about 6 miles W. N. W.  from the end of Break-sea Spit.    The first rendezvous appointed for lieutenant Murray, was the anchorage  near Sandy Cape; but the wind being unfavourable, we did not reach it  till four on the following afternoon [FRIDAY 30 JULY 1802]; at which time  the anchor was dropped in 7 fathoms, sandy bottom, with the outer  extremity of the cape bearing S. 79 deg. E., and the nearest part distant two  miles. A vessel was seen on the outside of the Spit, which proved to be  the Lady Nelson; and the master being sent with a boat to assist her  through the passage, she anchored near us at sunset, and lieutenant  Murray came on board. The account he gave of his separation, and the  delay in arriving at the rendezvous, convinced me both of the Lady Nelson  being an indifferent vessel, and of the truth of an observation before  made upon the currents: that they run much stronger to the southward at  the distance of six, and from that to twenty leagues off the coast, than  they do close in with the shore.

        INTRODUCTORY LETTER      Actuated by a sense of duty to the people with whom twelve years of my  life were passed on terms of intimacy and kindness, I was induced to write  the principal number of the following Letters as faithful sketches of the  Manners, Customs, and Habits of a people but little known to the European  reader. They were at first designed merely for the perusal of private  friends; who, viewing them with interest, recommended my bringing them  before the public, considering that the information they contained would  be acceptable from its originality, as presenting a more familiar view of  the opinions and the domestic habits of the Mussulmaun community of  Hindoostaun than any hitherto presented through other channels.    I have found (and I believe many will coincide with me in the opinion)  that it is far easier to think with propriety than to write our thoughts  with perspicuity and correctness; but when the object in view is one which  conscience dictates, the humblest effort of a female pen advances with  courage; and thus influenced, I venture to present my work to the public,  respectfully trusting they will extend their usual indulgence to a first  attempt, from the pen of a very humble scribe, more solicitous for  approbation than applause.    The orthography of Asiatic words may differ in some instances in my pages  from those of other writers--this, however, is from error, not design, and  may be justly attributed to my own faulty pronunciation.    I have inserted in these Letters many anecdotes and fables, which at the  first view, may be considered as mere nursery tales. My object, however,  will I trust plead my excuse: they are introduced in order to illustrate  the people whom I have undertaken to describe; and, primarily strengthened  by the moral tendency of each anecdote or fable selected for my pages, I  cannot but consider them as well suited to the purpose.    Without farther apology, but with very great deference, I leave these  imperfect attempts to the liberality of my readers, acknowledging with  gratitude the condescending patronage I have been honoured with, and  sincerely desiring wherever anticipations of amusement or information from  my observations have been formed, that the following pages may fulfil  those expectations, and thus gratify my wish to be in the smallest degree  useful in my generation.

I have promised to give you, my friends, occasional sketches of men and  manners, comprising the society of the Mussulmauns in India. Aware of the  difficulty of my task, I must entreat your kind indulgence to the  weaknesses of a female pen, thus exercised for your amusement, during my  twelve years' domicile in their immediate society.    Every one who sojourns in India for any lengthened period, will, I believe,  agree with me, that in order to promote health of body, the mind must be  employed in active pursuits. The constitutionally idle persons, of either  sex, amongst Europeans, are invariably most subject to feel distressed by  the prevailing annoyances of an Indian climate: from a listless life  results discontent, apathy, and often disease. I have found, by experience,  the salutary effects of employing time, as regards, generally, healthiness  of body and of mind. The hours devoted to this occupation (tracing remarks  for the perusal of far distant friends) have passed by without a murmur or  a sigh, at the height of the thermometer, or the length of a day during  the season of hot winds, or of that humid heat which prevails throughout  the periodical rains. Time flies quickly with useful employment in all  places; in this exhausting climate every one has to seek amusement in"]]]
