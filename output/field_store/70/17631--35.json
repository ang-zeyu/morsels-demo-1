His was  not the mere theoretic heroism which contents itself with celebrating the  deeds of others. His own conduct embodied the most noble conceptions of his  imagination, and his life and death exhibited a splendid example of the  patriotism which breathed throughout his verse. He was born at Dresden in  1791. His education was of the most careful kind. He was not only  instructed in various branches of learning, but the elegant accomplishments  of the fine arts were added, and the exercises of the body were not less  attended to than those of the mind. Called upon to choose some occupation,  he determined to apply himself to mining, and took up his residence at  Vienna, where he enjoyed the advantage of a familiar intercourse with  William Von Humboldt, the Prussian ambassador, Frederic Schlegel, and other  eminent literary and scientific men. Here, within the short space of  fifteen months, he produced a rapid succession of dramas, operas, and  farces, as well as several small poems. The success of his works obtained  him the appointment of poet to the court. He was now in the enjoyment of  all that could render life happy--competence, distinction, esteem,  friendship and love; but he resolved to sacrifice them all \"for that  greatest mortal blessing, his country's freedom.\"    \"Could I,\" says he, in a letter to his father, \"could I, think you, stand  aloof, contented to celebrate with weak inspiration the success of my  conquering brethren? I am aware that you will suffer much anxiety,--My  mother too will weep--may God be her comfort!--I cannot spare you this  trial. That I simply offer my life is of little import; but that I offer  it, crowned as it is with all the flowery wreaths of love, of friendship,  and of joy,--that I cast away the sweet sensations which lived in the  conviction that I have caused you no inquietude, no anguish,--this indeed  is a sacrifice which can only be opposed to such a prize!\"    He left Vienna in March 1813, and joined the free corps which Major Von  Lutzow was then forming. This was a voluntary association, and the corps  was remarkable throughout the war for its valour and enterprise. In the  midst of the most active campaigns, Korner continued to pour forth his  verses. Other poets have written of battles in the retirement of the  closet, but he sang his song of war on the tented field, and amid the din  of conflict. Nor was this all: he collected too the strains of other poets,  and adapted them to appropriate airs, to animate the ardour of his  companions in arms. We cannot follow him through his career, brief as it  was; but the subjoined incident is too striking to be omitted, and is  especially adapted to our purpose, as it affords an opportunity of giving a  passage of his unpremeditated verse in a moment of pain and danger.    On the 28th of May, Major Von Lutzow had determined on setting out on an  expedition towards Thuringia, with four squadrons of his cavalry, and fifty  cossacks. Korner earnestly entreated permission to accompany him, and his  desire was fulfilled by his being appointed adjutant by Major Von Lutzow,  who highly esteemed him, and wished to have him near his person.    The expedition passed in ten days through Halberstadt, Eisleben, Buttstadt,  and Schlaitz, to Plauen, though not without encountering great danger from  the enemy, who were dispersed throughout these districts, but, also, not  without effecting some important results. Intelligence and information were  procured, ammunition was captured and seized, and couriers on missions of  importance were taken prisoners. The gallant troop acquired considerable  renown, and harassed the enemy much, especially by cutting off his  communications. A plan was in consequence laid by the French emperor for  the extirpation of the corps, that, as a deterring example, no man should  be left alive. The armistice, concluded at this moment, afforded an  opportunity for putting it in practice. (The Duke of Padua, it is  observable, particularly profited by this armistice; for being shut up in  Leipzig by Generals Woronzow and Czernichef, with the co-operation of two  battalions of the Lutzow infantry, he was only saved by this cessation of  hostilities.)    Major Von Lutzow had received official information of the armistice at  Plauen. Without expecting to meet with any opposition, he chose the  shortest route to rejoin the infantry of his corps, having received the  most confidential assurances of safety from the enemy's commanding  officers, and proceeded along the high road, without interruption, to  Kitzen, a village in the neighbourhood of Leipzig; but here he found  himself surrounded and menaced by a very superior force. Theodore Korner  was despatched to demand an explanation; but, instead of replying, the  commander of the enemy struck at him with his sword; and it being now  twilight, a general attack was made on the three squadrons of the Lutzow  cavalry before they had drawn a sabre. Several were wounded and taken, and  others dispersed in the surrounding country; but Major Von Lutzow himself  was saved by the assistance of a squadron of Uhlans, who being in advance  with the Cossacks, formed the van-guard, and consequently were not assailed  at the same moment. He reached, with a considerable body of his troops, the  right bank of the Elbe, where the infantry of his corps, and a squadron of  its cavalry, were already collected.    Korner received the first blow, which he was not prepared to parry, as he  approached close to the enemy's commanding officer to deliver his message  without drawing his sabre, and was thus severely wounded in the head: the  second blow only inflicted a slight injury. He fell back, but speedily  recovered himself, and his spirited steed bore him in safety to a  neighbouring wood. He was here occupied, at the first moment, with the  assistance of a comrade, in binding up his wounds, when he perceived a  troop of the enemy, who were in pursuit, riding towards him. His presence  of mind did not forsake him, but turning towards the wood, he called with a  loud voice, \"Fourth squadron,--Advance!\"--His stratagem succeeded--the  enemy were appalled, drew back, and thus afforded him time to conceal  himself deeper in the wood. It had now become dark, and he found a place in  the thicket where he could remain undiscovered.    The pain of the deeper wound became very severe, his strength was  exhausted, and his last hope was gone. It was in this extremity that he  composed the beautiful sonnet, of which the following is a translation:--    FAREWELL TO LIFE.    [Written in the night of the 17th and 18th of June, as I lay, severely  wounded and helpless in a wood, expecting to die.]      \"My deep wound burns;--my pale lips quake in death,--    I feel my fainting heart resign its strife,    And reaching now the limit of my life,    Lord, to thy will I yield my parting breath!      Yet many a dream hath charm'd my youthful eye;    And must life's fairy visions all depart;    Oh surely no! for all that fired my heart    To rapture here, shall live with me on high.      And that fair form that won my earliest vow,    That my young spirit prized all else above,    And now adored as freedom, now as love,    Stands in seraphic guise, before me now.      And as my fading senses fade away,    It beckons me, on high, to realms of endless day!\"    During the night he heard the enemy searching the wood near him, but  afterwards fell asleep, and was saved in the morning by two peasants. He  was conveyed secretly into Leipsic, which was then under the French yoke,  and where the concealment of any of the Lutzow free corps was prohibited,  under severe punishment. He subsequently travelled in safety to Berlin, and  having recovered from his wound, rejoined the corps of Lutzow on the right  bank of the Elbe. Hostilities recommenced on the 17th of August; and on the  28th an engagement took place near Rosenberg, in which Korner fell. He was  in pursuit of a body of the enemy, when the riflemen, who had found a  rallying-place in some under-wood, sent forth a shower of balls upon their  pursuers. By one of these Korner was wounded in the abdomen, the liver and  spine were injured, and he was immediately deprived of speech and  consciousness. He was carried to a neighbouring wood, but all medical aid  was vain. He was buried under an oak in the village of Wobbelin, about a  mile from Ludwigslust. A tomb has since been placed over his remains, and  enclosed by a wall. He died at the early age of twenty-two.    _From a Critical Notice of The Life of Korner, New Monthly Mag._             *       *       *       *       *      Cannot he that wisely declines walking upon the ice for fear of falling,  though possibly it might carry him sooner to his journey's end, as wisely  forbear drinking more wine than is necessary, for fear of being drunk and  the ill-consequences thereof?--_Lord Clarendon._           *       *       *       *       *        THE NOVELIST.

[3] For the honour of the _llaneros_, this circumstance ought to be          more distinctly detailed.    In 1817, he landed near Barcelona, where he collected seven hundred  recruits, and marched towards Caracas; but, being worsted in an affair at  Clarines, he fell back again upon Barcelona, where he shut himself up with  four hundred men, and made a successful resistance against a superior  force.    Bolivar received some reinforcements from the interior of the province of  Cumana, upon which he decided upon making the banks of the Orinoco the  theatre of his future efforts. Having further augmented his force, and  taken the necessary steps to keep alive the war in the districts on the  coast, he marched to the interior, beating several small royalist parties  which he encountered on his route.    Of the Spanish army which had returned from New Granada, a division, under  the brave General La Torre, was destined to act against the patriots in  Guayana. A division of the latter, under General Piar, having obtained a  decisive victory, Bolivar was enabled to invest Angostura, and the town of  old Guyana, which were successively taken on the 3rd and 18th of July.    In Angostura, Piar was found guilty, by a court-martial, of an attempt to  excite a war of colour. Piar (a man of colour himself) was the bravest of  the brave, and adored by his followers; but his execution stifled anarchy  in the bud.    The rest of the year 1817 was actively spent in organizing a force to act  against Morillo, who had lately been reinforced by two thousand fresh  troops from the Peninsula, under General Canterac, then on his way from  Spain to Peru. An abundant supply of arms, received from England, was sent  to the patriot corps on the banks of the Apure.

(_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      Enclosed I send you a drawing of a Roman votive altar, which was found in  digging a cellar about six feet deep, in St. Sepulchre's Gate, Doncaster,  in the year 1781. It is the oldest relic of antiquity which Doncaster has  yet produced, and is of exquisite engraving and workmanship. Upon the  capital, or top of the stone, a small space above the sculpture of the  altar itself, is a crater or flowing bowl,[4] sacred to Bacchus, the god of  wine; on the dexter, or right side of the altar, is a flower-pot, or  cornucopiae, with five branches in it, loaded with leaves and fruit, sacred  to Ceres, or Terra-Mater, the goddess of plants; and on the sinister, or  left side thereof, is a large jug or pitcher with a large handle, also  sacred to Bacchus. It is about 2 feet 6-1/2 inches in height, and 1 foot in  breadth at the base. The corporation employed a Mr. Richard John Tetlow, of  Ferrybridge, a celebrated antiquary, to interpret the inscription, and give  them his opinion on its age. They also sent it to the Antiquarian Society  in London for inspection.        [4] If not a flowing bowl, then it is the shield of Diana.    _Interpretation of the Society._    Matribus magnis,[5] Nantonius[6] Orberthol, vota solvit lubens merito.

Freely  and fully he has discharged his vows and promises.    It is, reasonably enough, conjectured from several corroborative  circumstances, that the altar above described is no less than 1,645 years  old. One of these circumstances is its being similar in some respects to  two other Roman altars which were found in England some years back, one of  which is related to have been made in the year of Christ 161.    _Near Sheffield._ J.M.

War! what miseries are heaped together in the sound!--What an accumulation  of curses is breathed in that one word. To us, happy in our insular  position, we have, within existing memory, known chiefly of war, its pomp  and circumstance alone; the gay parade, the glancing arms, the bright  colours, the inspiring music--these are what we see of war in its  outset;--glory, and praise, and badges of honour, these are what appear to  us as its result. The favourite son, the beloved brother, he who, perhaps,  is dearer still, returns to the home of his youth or of his heart, having  sown danger and reaped renown. Thus do we look on war. But ask the  inhabitant of a country _which has been the seat of war_, what is _his_  opinion of it. He will tell you that he has seen his country ravaged, his  home violated, his family ---- But no! the tongue recoils from speaking the  horrors and atrocities of war thus brought into the bosom of a peaceful  home. All the amenities and charities of domestic life are outraged, are  annihilated. All that is dearest to man; all that tends to refine, to  soften him--to make him a noble and a better being--all these are trampled  under foot by a brutal soldiery--all these are torn from his heart for  ever! He will tell you that he detests war so much that he almost despises  its glories; and that he detests it because he has known its evils, and  felt how poorly and miserably they are compensated by the fame which is  given to the slaughterer and the destroyer, because he is such!    _Tales of Passion._           *       *       *       *       *      THE NEWSPAPERS.
