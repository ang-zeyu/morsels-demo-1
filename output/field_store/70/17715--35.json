You are doing a lot of government work, are you not?\"    \"Yes; war orders. And we're up to our neck in them. This war is going  to be almost as much fought in the air as on the ground, Mr. Swift.\"    \"I can well believe that,\" agreed Tom. \"Won't you have a chair?\"    \"Well, we didn't come to stay long,\" said Mr. Gale with a laugh, which,  somehow or other, grated on Tom and seemed to him insincere. \"Our  business is such a rushing one that we don't spend much time anywhere.  To get down to brass tacks, we have come to see you to put a certain  proposition before you, Mr. Swift. You are open to a business  proposition, aren't you?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" answered Tom. \"That's what I'm here for.\"    \"I thought so. Well, now I'll tell you, in brief, what we want, and  then Mr. Ware, our treasurer, can elaborate on it, and give you facts  and figures about which I never bother myself. I attend to the  executive end and leave the details to others,\" and again came that  laugh which Tom did not like.    \"You came here to make me an offer?\" asked the young inventor,  wondering to which of his many machines the visitors had reference.    \"Yes,\" went on Mr. Gale, \"we came here to make you a big offer.  In  short, Mr. Swift, we want you to work for our company, and we are  willing to pay you ten thousand dollars a year for the benefit of your  advice and your inventive abilities. Ten thousand dollars a year! Do  you accept?\"          CHAPTER IV    MR. DAMON'S WHIZZER      Characteristic it was of Tom Swift that he did not seem at all  surprised at what most young men would call a liberal offer.  Certainly  not many youths of Tom's age would be sought out by a big manufacturing  concern, and offered ten thousand dollars a year \"right off the reel,\"  as Ned Newton expressed it later. But Tom only smiled and shook his  head in negation.    \"What!\" cried Mr. Gale, \"you mean you won't accept our offer?\"    \"I can't,\" answered Tom.    \"You can't!\" exclaimed the treasurer, Mr. Ware. \"Oh, I see. Mr. Gale, a  word with you. Excuse us a moment,\" he added to Tom and his father.    The two men consulted in a corner of the library for a moment, and  then, with smiles on their faces, once more turned toward the young  inventor.    \"Well, perhaps you are right, Tom Swift,\" said Mr. Gale. \"Of course, we  recognize your talents and ability, but you cannot blame us for trying  to get talent, as well as material for our airships, in the cheapest  market. But we are not hide-bound, nor sticklers for any set sum. We'll  make that offer fifteen thousand dollars a year, if you will sign a  five-year contract and agree that we shall have first claim on anything  and everything you may patent or invent in that time. Now, how does  that strike you?  Fifteen thousand dollars a year--paid weekly if you  wish, and our Mr. Ware, here, has a form of contract which can be fixed  up and signed within ten minutes, if you agree.\"    \"Well, I don't like to be disagreeable,\" said Tom with a smile; \"but,  really, as I said before, I can't accept your very kind offer. I may  say liberal offer. I appreciate that.\"    \"You can't accept!\" cried Mr. Gale.    \"Are you sure you don't mean 'won't'?\" asked Mr. Ware, in a half growl.    \"You may call it that if you like,\" replied Tom, a bit coolly, for he  did not like the other's tone, \"Only, as I say, I cannot accept. I have  other plans.\"    \"Oh, you--\" began the brusk treasurer, but Mr. Gale, the president of  the Universal Flying Machine Company, stopped his associate with a  warning look.    \"Just a moment, Mr. Swift,\" begged the president. \"Don't be hasty. We  are prepared to make you a last and final offer, and I do not believe  you can refuse it.\"    \"Well, I certainly will not refuse it without hearing it,\" said Tom,  with a smile he meant to make good-natured. Yet, truth to tell, he did  not at all like the two visitors. There was something about them that  aroused his antagonism, and he said later that even if they had offered  him a sum which he felt he ought not, in justice to himself and his  father, refuse, he would have felt a distaste in working for a company  represented by the twain.    \"This is our offer,\" said Mr. Gale, and he spoke in a pompous manner  which seemed to say: \"If you don't take it, why, it will be the worse  for you.\" He looked at his treasurer for a confirmatory nod and,  receiving it, went on. \"We are prepared to offer and pay you, and will  enter into such a contract, with the stipulation about the inventions  that I mentioned before--we are prepared to pay you--twenty thousand  dollars a year! Now what do you say to that, Tom Swift?    \"Twenty-thousand-dollars-a-year!\" repeated Mr. Gale unctuously, rolling  the words off his tongue. \"Twen-ty-thou-sand-dol-lars-a-year!  Think of  it!\"    \"I am thinking of it,\" said Tom Swift gently, \"and I thank you for your  offer. It is, indeed, very generous. But I must give you the same  answer. I cannot accept.\"    \"Tom!\" exclaimed his aged father.    \"Mr. Swift!\" exclaimed the two visitors.    Tom smiled and shook his head.    \"Oh, I know very well what I am saying, and what I am turning down,\" he  said. \"But I simply cannot accept. I have other plans.  I am sorry you  have had your trip for nothing,\" he added to the visitors, \"but,  really, I must refuse.\"    \"Is that your final answer?\" asked Mr. Gale.    \"Yes.\"    \"Don't you want to take a day or two to think it over?\" asked the  treasurer. \"Don't be hasty. Remember that very few young men can  command that salary, and I may say you will find us liberal in other  ways. You would have some time to yourself.\"    \"That is what I most need,\" returned Tom. \"Time to myself. No, thank  you, gentlemen, I cannot accept.\"    \"Be careful!\" warned Mr. Gale, and it sounded as though there might be  a threat in his voice. \"This is our last offer, and your last chance.  We will not renew this. If you do not accept our twenty thousand  dollars now, you will never get it again.\"    \"I realize that,\" said Tom, \"and I am prepared to take the consequences.    \"Very well, then,\" said Mr. Gale. \"There seems nothing for us to do,  Mr. Ware, but to go back to New York. I bid you good-day,\" and he bowed  stiffly to Tom. \"I hope you will not regret your refusal of our offer.\"    \"I hope so myself,\" said Tom, lightly.    When the visitors had gone Mr. Swift turned toward his son, and,  shaking his head, remarked:    \"Of course, you know your own business best, Tom. Yet I cannot but feel  you have made a mistake.\"    \"How?\" asked Tom. \"By not taking that money? I can easily make that in  a year, with an idea I have in mind for an improvement on an airship.  And your new electric motor will soon be ready for the market. Besides,  we don't really need the money.\"    \"No, not now, Tom, but there is no telling when we may,\" said Mr.  Swift, slowly. \"This big war has made many changes, and things that  brought us in a good income before, hardly sell at all, now.\"    \"Oh, don't worry, Dad! We still have a few shots left in the locker--in  other words, the bank. I'm expecting Ned Newton over any moment now, to  give us the annual statement of our account, and then we'll know where  we stand. I'm not afraid from the money end. Our business has done  well, and it is going to do better. I have a new idea.\"    \"That's all very well, Tom,\" said Mr. Swift, who seemed oppressed by  something. \"As you say, money isn't everything, and I know we shall  always have enough to live on. But there is something about those two  men I do not like. They were very angry at your refusal of their offer.  I could see that. Tom, I don't want to be a croaker, but I think you'll  have to watch out for those men. They're going to be your enemies--your  rivals in the airship field,\" and Mr. Swift shook his head dolefully.    \"Well, rivalry, when it's clean and above board, is the spice of trade  and invention,\" returned Tom, lightly. \"I'm not afraid of that.\"    \"No, but it may be unfair and underhand,\" said Mr. Swift. \"I think it  would have been better, Tom, to have accepted their offer. Twenty  thousand a year, clear money, is a good sum.\"    \"Yes, but I may make twice that with something that occurred to me only  a little while ago. Forget about those men, Dad, and I'll tell you my  new idea. But wait, I want Mr. Damon to hear it, too.  Where is he?\"    \"He was here a little while ago. He went out when those two men came  and--\"    At that moment, from the garden at the side of the library, the sound  of voices in dispute could be heard.    \"Now yo' all g'wan 'way from yeah!\" exclaimed some one who could be  none other than Eradicate Sampson. \"Whut fo' yo' all want to clutter up  dish yeah place fo'? Massa Tom said I was to do de garden wuk, an' I'se  gwine to do it! G'wan 'way, Giant!\"    \"Ho! You want me to get out, s'pose you put me, black face!\" cried a  big voice, that of Koku, the giant.    \"There they go! At it again!\" cried Tom with a smile. \"Might have known  if I told Rad to do anything that Koku would be jealous. Well, I'll  have to go out now and give that giant something to do that will tax  his strength.\"    But as Tom was about to leave the room another voice was heard in the  garden.    \"Now, boys, be nice,\" said some one soothingly. \"The garden is large  enough for you both to work in. Rad, you begin at the lower end and  spade toward the middle. Koku, you begin at the upper end and work  down. Whoever gets to the middle first will win.\"    \"Ha! Den I'll show dat giant some spade wuk as is spade wuk!\" cried the  colored man. \"Garden wuk is mah middle name.\"    \"Be careful, Rad!\" laughed Mr. Damon, for he it was who was trying to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#4)"],[1,"ly, in the Channel and along the coast, all the way from  Antwerp to Cadiz. Nor did the left arm of his power stop there; for his  fleets, his transports, and his merchantmen ranged the coasts of both  Americas from one side of the present United States right round to the  other.    Such, in brief, was the position of maritime Europe when Henry found  himself menaced by the three Roman Catholic powers of Scotland, France,  and Spain. In 1533 he had divorced his first wife, Catherine of Aragon,  thereby defying the Pope and giving offence to Spain. He had again  defied the Pope by suppressing the monasteries and severing the Church  of England from the Roman discipline. The Pope had struck back with a  bull of excommunication designed to make Henry the common enemy of  Catholic Europe.    Henry had been steadily building ships for years. Now he redoubled his  activity. He blooded the fathers of his daughter's sea-dogs by smashing  up a pirate fleet and sinking a flotilla of Flemish privateers. The  mouth of the Scheldt, in 1539, was full of vessels ready to take a  hostile army into England. But such a fighting fleet prepared to meet  them that Henry's enemies forbore to strike.    In 1539, too, came the discovery of the art of tacking, by Fletcher of  Rye, Henry's shipwright friend, a discovery forever memorable in the  annals of seamanship. Never before had any kind of craft been sailed a  single foot against the wind. The primitive dugout on which the  prehistoric savage hoisted the first semblance of a sail, the ships of  Tarshish, the Roman transport in which St. Paul was wrecked, and the  Spanish caravels with which Columbus sailed to worlds unknown, were, in  principle of navigation, all the same. But now Fletcher ran out his  epoch-making vessel, with sails trimmed fore and aft, and dumbfounded  all the shipping in the Channel by beating his way to windward against a  good stiff breeze. This achievement marked the dawn of the modern  sailing age.    And so it happened that in 1545 Henry, with a new-born modern fleet, was  able to turn defiantly on Francis. The English people rallied  magnificently to his call. What was at that time an enormous army  covered the lines of advance on London. But the fleet, though employing  fewer men, was relatively a much more important force than the army; and  with the fleet went Henry's own headquarters. His lifelong interest in  his navy now bore the first-fruits of really scientific sea power on an  oceanic scale. There was no great naval battle to fix general attention  on one dramatic moment. Henry's strategy and tactics, however, were new  and full of promise. He repeated his strategy of the previous war by  sending out a strong squadron to attack the base at which the enemy's  ships were then assembling; and he definitely committed the English  navy, alone among all the navies in the world, to sailing-ship tactics,  instead of continuing those founded on the rowing galley of immemorial  fame. The change from a sort of floating army to a really naval fleet,  from galleys moved by oars and depending on boarders who were soldiers,  to ships moved by sails and depending on their broadside guns--this  change was quite as important as the change in the nineteenth century  from sails and smooth-bores to steam and rifled ordnance. It was,  indeed, from at least one commanding point of view, much more important;  for it meant that England was easily first in developing the only kind  of navy which would count in any struggle for oversea dominion after the  discovery of America had made sea power no longer a question of coasts  and landlocked waters but of all the outer oceans of the world.    The year that saw the birth of modern sea power is a date to be  remembered in this history; for 1545 was also the year in which the  mines of Potosi first aroused the Old World to the riches of the New; it  was the year, too, in which Sir Francis Drake was born. Moreover, there  was another significant birth in this same year. The parole aboard the  Portsmouth fleet was _God save the King_! The answering countersign was  _Long to reign over us_! These words formed the nucleus of the national  anthem now sung round all the Seven Seas. The anthems of other countries  were born on land. _God save the King_! sprang from the navy and the  sea.           *       *       *       *       *    The Reformation quickened seafaring life in many ways. After Henry's  excommunication every Roman Catholic crew had full Papal sanction for  attacking every English crew that would not submit to Rome, no matter  how Catholic its faith might be. Thus, in addition to danger from  pirates, privateers, and men-of-war, an English merchantman had to risk  attack by any one who was either passionately Roman or determined to use  religion as a cloak. Raids and reprisals grew apace. The English were by  no means always lambs in piteous contrast to the Papal wolves. Rather,  it might be said, they took a motto from this true Russian proverb:  'Make yourself a sheep and you'll find no lack of wolves.' But, rightly  or wrongly, the general English view was that the Papal attitude was one  of attack while their own was one of defence. Papal Europe of course  thought quite the reverse.    Henry died in 1547, and the Lord Protector Somerset at once tried to  make England as Protestant as possible during the minority of Edward VI,  who was not yet ten years old. This brought every English seaman under  suspicion in every Spanish port, where the Holy Office of the  Inquisition was a great deal more vigilant and businesslike than the  Custom House or Harbor Master. Inquisitors had seized Englishmen in  Henry's time. But Charles had stayed their hand. Now that the ruler of  England was an open heretic, who appeared to reject the accepted forms  of Catholic belief as well as the Papal forms of Roman discipline, the  hour had come to strike. War would have followed in ordinary times. But  the Reformation had produced a cross-division among the subjects of all  the Great Powers. If Charles went to war with a Protestant Lord  Protector of England then some of his own subjects in the Netherlands  would probably revolt. France had her Huguenots; England her  ultra-Papists; Scotland some of both kinds. Every country had an unknown  number of enemies at home and friends abroad. All feared war.    Somerset neglected the navy. But the seafaring men among the  Protestants, as among those Catholics who were anti-Roman, took to  privateering more than ever. Nor was exploration forgotten. A group of  merchant-adventurers sent Sir Hugh Willoughby to find the Northeast  Passage to Cathay. Willoughby's three ships were towed down the Thames  by oarsmen dressed in sky-blue jackets. As they passed the palace at  Greenwich they dipped their colors in salute. But the poor young king  was too weak to come to the window. Willoughby met his death in Lapland.  But Chancellor, his second-in-command, got through to the White Sea,  pushed on overland to Moscow, and returned safe in 1554, when Queen Mary  was on the throne. Next year, strange to say, the charter of the new  Muscovy Company was granted by Philip of Armada fame, now joint  sovereign of England with his newly married wife, soon to be known as  'Bloody Mary.' One of the directors of the company was Lord Howard of  Effingham, father of Drake's Lord Admiral, while the governor was our  old friend Sebastian Cabot, now in his eightieth year. Philip was Crown  Prince of the Spanish Empire, and his father, Charles V, was very  anxious that he should please the stubborn English; for if he could only  become both King of England and Emperor of Germany he would rule the  world by sea as well as land. Philip did his ineffective best: drank  English beer in public as if he liked it and made his stately Spanish  courtiers drink it too and smile. He spent Spanish gold, brought over  from America, and he got the convenient kind of Englishmen to take it as  spy-money for many years to come. But with it he likewise sowed some  dragon's teeth. The English sea-dogs never forgot the iron chests of  Spanish New-World gold, and presently began to wonder whether there was  no sure way in far America by which to get it for themselves.    In the same year, 1555, the Marian attack on English heretics began and  the sea became safer than the land for those who held strong anti-Papal  views. The Royal Navy was neglected even more than it had been lately by  the Lord Protector. But fighting traders, privateers, and pirates  multiplied. The seaports were hotbeds of hatred against Mary, Philip,  Papal Rome, and Spanish Inquisition. In 1556 Sebastian Cabot reappears,  genial and prosperous as ever, and dances out of history at the sailing  of the _Serchthrift_, bound northeast for Muscovy. In 1557 Philip came  back to England for the last time and manoeuvred her into a war which  cost her Calais, the last English foothold on the soil of France. During  this war an English squadron joined Philip's vessels in a victory over  the French off Gravelines, where Drake was to fight the Armada thirty  years later.    This first of the two battles fought at Gravelines brings us down to  1558, the year in which Mary died, Elizabeth succeeded her, and a very  different English age began.          CHAPTER III    LIFE AFLOAT IN TUDOR TIMES      Two stories from Hakluyt's _Voyages_ will illustrate what sort of work  the English were attempting in America about 1530, near the middle of  King Henry's reign. The success of 'Master Haukins' and the failure of  'Master Hore' are quite typical of several other adventures in the New  World.    'Olde M.
