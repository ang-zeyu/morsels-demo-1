ADELINE _(Lady)_, the wife of lord Henry Amun'deville (4 _syl_.), a  highly educated aristocratic lady, with all the virtues and weaknesses  of the upper ten. After the parliamentary sessions this noble pair  filled their house with guests, amongst which were the duchess of  Fitz-Fulke, the duke of D----, Aurora Raby, and don Juan, \"the Russian  envoy.\" The tale not being finished, no key to these names is given.

When Mercilla sends her ambassador, Samient, to negotiate  peace, Adicia, in violation of international law, thrusts her Samient  out of doors like a dog, and sets two knights upon her. Sir Artegal  comes to her rescue, attacks the two knights, and knocks one of them  from his saddle with such force that he breaks his neck. After the  discomfiture of the soldan, Adicia rushes forth with a knife to stab  Samient, but, being intercepted by sir Artegal, is changed into a  tigress.--Spenser, _Faery Queen_, v. 8 (1596).

Jupiter, to settle the  dispute, decided that the boy should spend six months with Venus in  the upper world and six with Proserpina in the lower. Adonis was gored  to death by a wild boar in a hunt.    Shakespeare has a poem called _Venus and Adonis_. Shelley calls his  elegy on the poet Keats _Adona'is_, under the idea that the untimely  death of Keats resembled that of Adonis.    (_Adonis_ is an allegory of the sun, which is six months north of the  horizon, and six months south. Thammuz is the same as Adonis, and so  is Osiris).    ADONIRAM PENN, the obstinate and well-to-do farmer in Mary E.  Wilkins's _Revolt of \"Mother_\". He persists in building a new barn  which the cattle do not need instead of the much-needed dwelling for  his family. In his absence, \"Mother,\" who was wont to \"stand before  her husband in the humble fashion of a Scripture woman,\" moves  household and furniture into the commodious barn.    \"Adoniram was like a fortress whose walls had no active resistance,  and went down the instant the right besieging tools were used\" (1890).

To this he  complied, but during sleep she murdered him with his own scymitar.

[The word means \"the mighty  magnificent king.\"]    The Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adramelech.--2  _Kings_ xvii. 31.    Klopstock introduces him into _The Messiah_, and represents him as  surpassing Satan in malice and guile, ambition and mischief. He is  made to hate every one, even Satan, of whose rank he is jealous, and  whom he hoped to overthrow, that by putting an end to his servitude  he might become the supreme god of all the created worlds. At the  crucifixion he and Satan are both driven back to hell by Obad'don, the  angel of death.    ADRASTE' (_2 syl_.), a French gentleman, who inveigles a Greek slave  named Isidore from don Pedre. His plan is this: He gets introduced as  a portrait-painter, and thus imparts to Isidore his love, and obtains  her consent to elope with him. He then sends his slave Zaide (_2  syl_.) to don Pedre, to crave protection for ill treatment, and Pedre  promises to befriend her. At this moment Adraste appears, and demands  that Zaide be given up to him to punish as he thinks proper. Pedre  intercedes; Adraste seems to relent; and Pedre calls for Zaide. Out  comes Isidore instead, with Zaide's veil. \"There,\" says Pedre, \"take  her and use her well.\" \"I will do so,\" says the Frenchman, and leads  off the Greek slave.--Moliere, _Le Sicilien, ou L'Amour Peintre_  (1667).    ADRIAN'A, a wealthy Ephesian lady, who marries Antiph'olus,  twin-brother of Antipholus of Syracuse. The abbess Aemilia is her  mother-in-law, but she knows it not; and one day when she accuses her  husband of infidelity, she says to the abbess, if he is unfaithful it  is not from want of remonstrance, \"for it is the one subject of our  conversation. In bed I will not let him sleep for speaking of it; at  table I will not let him eat for speaking of it; when alone with him I  talk of nothing else, and in company I give him frequent hints of  it. In a word, all my talk is how vile and bad it is in him to love  another better than he loves his wife\" (act v. sc. 1).--Shakespeare,  _Comedy of Errors_ (1593).    ADRIA'NO DE ARMA'DO _(Don)_, a pompous, fantastical Spaniard, a  military braggart in a state of peace, as Parolles (3 _syl_.) was in  war.

Prince Arthur, having slain Corflambo,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#4)"],[1,"the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one and all, each  in its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange distress. But the  willows especially; for ever they went on chattering and talking among  themselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying out, sometimes sighing--but  what it was they made so much to-do about belonged to the secret life of  the great plain they inhabited. And it was utterly alien to the world I  knew, or to that of the wild yet kindly elements. They made me think of a  host of beings from another plane of life, another evolution altogether,  perhaps, all discussing a mystery known only to themselves. I watched them  moving busily together, oddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their  myriad leaves even when there was no wind. They moved of their own will as  though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen  sense of the horrible.    There they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our camp,  shaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all ready for an  attack.    The psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very vivid;  for the wanderer, especially, camps have their \"note\" either of welcome or  rejection. At first it may not always be apparent, because the busy  preparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first pause--after  supper usually--it comes and announces itself. And the note of this  willow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me; we were interlopers,  trespassers; we were not welcomed. The sense of unfamiliarity grew upon me  as I stood there watching. We touched the frontier of a region where our  presence was resented. For a night's lodging we might perhaps be tolerated;  but for a prolonged and inquisitive stay--No! by all the gods of the trees  and wilderness, no! We were the first human influences upon this island,  and we were not wanted. The willows were against us.    Strange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know not whence,  found lodgment in my mind as I stood listening. What, I thought, if, after  all, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they should  rise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods whose  territory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps, booming  overhead in the night--and then settle down! As I looked it was so easy to  imagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a little, huddled  together in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind that should finally  start them a-running. I could have sworn their aspect changed a little, and  their ranks deepened and pressed more closely together.    The melancholy shrill cry of a night-bird sounded overhead, and suddenly I  nearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I stood upon fell with a great  splash into the river, undermined by the flood. I stepped back just in  time, and went on hunting for firewood again, half laughing at the odd  fancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their spell upon me.  I recalled the Swede's remark about moving on next day, and I was just  thinking that I fully agreed with him, when I turned with a start and saw  the subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front of me. He was  quite close. The roar of the elements had covered his approach.          II      \"You've been gone so long,\" he shouted above the wind, \"I thought something  must have happened to you.\"    But there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well,  that conveyed to me more than his usual words, and in a flash I understood  the real reason for his coming. It was because the spell of the place had  entered his soul too, and he did not like being alone.    \"River still rising,\" he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight,  \"and the wind's simply awful.\"    He always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship that  gave the real importance to his words.    \"Lucky,\" I cried back, \"our tent's in the hollow. I think it'll hold all  right.\" I added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in order to  explain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung them across the  river, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me through the branches,  nodding his head.    \"Lucky if we get away without disaster!\" he shouted, or words to that  effect; and I remember feeling half angry with him for putting the thought  into words, for it was exactly what I felt myself. There was disaster  impending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay unpleasantly upon  me.    We went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with our  feet. We took a last look round. But for the wind the heat would have been  unpleasant. I put this thought into words, and I remember my friend's reply  struck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the ordinary July  weather, than this \"diabolical wind.\"    Everything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside the  tent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack hanging from  a willow-stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe distance from the  fire, all ready for the morning meal.    We smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. The flap  of the tent door was up, and I saw the branches and the stars and the white  moonlight. The shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of the wind against  our taut little house were the last things I remembered as sleep came down  and covered all with its soft and delicious forgetfulness.    Suddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress through  the door of the tent. I looked at my watch pinned against the canvas, and  saw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve o'clock--the threshold  of a new day--and I had therefore slept a couple of hours. The Swede was  asleep still beside me; the wind howled as before; something plucked at my  heart and made me feel afraid. There was a sense of disturbance in my  immediate neighborhood.    I sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying violently to and  fro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay snugly  safe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting enough  resistance to make it vicious. The feeling of disquietude did not pass,  however, and I crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our belongings  were safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my companion. A curious  excitement was on me.    I was half-way out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in that  the tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of leaves, made  shapes against the sky. I sat back on my haunches and stared. It was  incredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly above me, were shapes  of some indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches swayed in  the wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes, forming a  series of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the moon. Close,  about fifty feet in front of me, I saw these things.    My first instinct was to waken my companion, that he too might see them,  but something made me hesitate--the sudden realization, probably, that I  should not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile I crouched there staring in  amazement with smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember saying to myself  that I was not dreaming.    They first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within the  tops of the bushes--immense, bronze-colored, moving, and wholly independent  of the swaying of the branches. I saw them plainly and noted, now I came to  examine them more calmly, that they were very much larger than human, and  indeed that something in their appearance proclaimed them to be not human  at all. Certainly they were not merely the moving tracery of the branches  against the moonlight. They shifted independently. They rose upwards in a  continuous stream from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they  reached the dark of the sky. They were interlaced one with another, making  a great column, and I saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out of  each other, forming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted  spirally with the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude,  fluid shapes, passing up the bushes, within the leaves almost--rising up in  a living column into the heavens. Their faces I never could see.  Unceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with a  hue of dull bronze upon their skins.    I stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. For a long  time I thought they must every moment disappear and resolve themselves into  the movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion. I  searched everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while I understood  quite well that the standard of reality had changed. For the longer I  looked the more certain I became that these figures were real and living,  though perhaps not according to the standards that the camera and the  biologist would insist upon.    Far from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder such  as I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at the personified elemental  forces of this haunted and primeval region. Our intrusion had stirred the  powers of the place into activity. It was we who were the cause of the  disturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories and legends of  the spirits and deities of places that have been acknowledged and  worshipped by men in all ages of the world's history. But, before I could  arrive at any possible explanation, something impelled me to go farther  out, and I crept forward on the sand and stood upright. I felt the ground  still warm under my bare feet; the wind tore at my hair and face; and the  sound of the river burst upon my ears with a sudden roar. These things, I  knew, were real, and proved that my senses were acting normally. Yet"]]]
