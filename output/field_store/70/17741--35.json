Toasted  dates often eaten are very good for the same.      _For a Paine or Ache in the Back._    Take _Nepe, Archangel, Parsley_, and _Clarie_, of each halfe a handfull  wash them cleane, and cut them small, and then fry them with  a little sweet Butter, then take the yolks of three or four Eggs,  beat them well together, and put them to the Hearbs, fry them all  together, and eat them fasting every morning, with some _Sugar_; to  take away the unsavorinesse of the Hearbs, some use to take only  _Clary_ leaves, and _Parsley_ washed, not cut, or _Clary_ leaves alone, and  powring the yolks of the Eggs upon them, so fry them, and eat  them.      _For a suddain Bleeding at the Nose._    Burne an Egg shell in the fire till it be as black as a coale, then  beat it to a fine powder, and let the party snufle it up into his  Nostrills.      _A Medicine for Burning or Scalding._    Take _Madenwort_, stamp it, and seeth it in fresh Butter, and  therewith anoynt the place grieved presently.      _For the Canker in Womens Breasts._    Take _Goose_-dung, _Celedonie_, stamp them well together, and  lay it plaister-wise to the soare, it will cleanse the _Canker_, kill the  wormes, and heale the soare.      _For the Canker in the Mouth._    Take the juice of _Plantaine, Vineger_ and _Rose_ water, of each  a like quantity, mingle them together, and wash the mouth often  with them.      _To make a Tooth fall out of it selfe._    Take wheat flower and mix it with the Milk of an Hearb called  _Spurge_, make thereof a past, and fill the hole of the Tooth therewith,  and leave it there, changing it every two houres, and the  Tooth will fall out.      _To take away the cause of the paine in the Teeth._    Wash the mouth two or three times together in the morning  every moneth, with _White-wine_ wherein the root of _Spurge_ hath  been sodden, and you shall never have paine in your Teeth.      _For A Consumption._    Take Ash-keyes so soon as they look wither'd, set them into  an Oven, the bread being drawne, in a pewter, or rather an earthen  dish, and being so dryed pull off the out side, and reserving the  inner part, or the seed, or keyes, beat them to fine powder, and  either mix it with good English honey, and so eat of it, first and  last, morning and evening, a pretty deale of it at once, upon the  point of a knife, or else drink of the powder in some posset Ale, or  thin broth. Mares milk, or Asses milk, which is best, being drunk  warm morning and evening, is the most soveraigne Medicine  for it.      _An excellent Medicine for the Cough of the Lungs._    Take _Fennell_ and _Angelica_ of each one handfull, the leaves in  Summer, roots in Winter, sliced figgs twelve, but if the body be  bound, twenty at least, green Licorice if you can, two or three  good sticks scraped and sliced, Anniseed cleaved and bruised, two  good spoonfulls, two or three Parsley roots scraped, and the pith  taken out, and twenty leaves of Foale-foot, boyle all these in  three pints of _Hysop_ water, to a pint and halfe, then straine it out  into a glasse, putting to it as much white _Sugar_-candy as will make  it sweet, drink hereof, being warmed, five spoonfulls at a time,  first in the morning, and last in the evening, taking heed that you  eat nor drink any thing two howres before nor after.           *       *       *       *       *          _Of Violets._      _The use of Oyle of Violets._    Oyle of _Violets, Cammomile, Lillies, Elder flowers, Cowslips, Rue,  Wormwood_, and _Mint_, are made after the same sort; Oyle of  _Violets_, if it be rubbed about the Tempels of the head, doth remove  the extream heat, asswageth the head Ache, provoketh sleep, and  moistneth the braine; it is good against melancholly, dullnesse,  and heavinesse of the spirits, and against swellings, and soares  that be over-hot.      _The Syrupe of Violets._    Take faire water, boyle it, scum it, and to every ounce of it so  boyled and scummed, take six ounces of the blew of _Violets_, only  shift them as before, nine times, and the last time take nine ounces  of _Violets_, let them stand between times of shifting, 12 houres,  keeping the liquor still on hot embers, that it may be milk warm,  and no warmer; after the first shifting you must stamp and straine  your last nine ounces of _Violets_, and put in only the juice of them,  then take to every pint of this liquor thus prepared, one pound of  _Sugar_ finely beaten, boyle it, and keep it with stirring till the _Sugar_  be all melted, which if you can, let be done before it boyle,  and then boyle it up with a quick fire.

[Illustration: Violets]      _To make Paste of Violets, or any kind of Flowers._    Take your Flowers, pick them, and stamp them in an _Alablaster_  morter, then steep them two howres in a sauser of _Rose_-water, after  straine it, and steep a little _Gum Dragon_ in the same water, then  beat it to past, print it in your Moulds, and it will be of the very  colour and tast of the Flowers, then gild them, and so you may  have every Flower in his owne colour, and tast better for the  mouth, then any printed colour.      _Powder of Violets._    Take sweet _Ireos_ roots one ounce, red _Roses_ two ounces, _Storax_  one ounce and a halfe, _Cloves_ two drams, _Marjerome_ one dram,  _Lavinder_ flowers one dram and a halfe, make these into powder;  then take eight graines of fine _Muske_ powdered, also put to it two  ounces of _Rose_-water, stir them together, and put all the rest to  them, and stir them halfe an hour, till the water be dryed, then  set it by one day, and dry it by the fire halfe an houre, and when  it is dry put it up into bagges.      _A good Plaister for the Strangury._    Take _Violets_, and _Hollyhokes_, and _Mercury_, the leaves of these  Hearbs, or the seeds of them, also the rinde of the _Elderne_ tree,  and _Leydwort_, of each of these a handfull, and beat them small,  and seeth them in water, till halfe be consumed, and put thereto  a little oyle Olive, and make thereof a plaister, and lay it to the  soare and reines; also in the summer thou must make him a  drink on this manner, take _Saxifrage_, and the leaves of _Elderne_,  five leav'd grasse, and seath them in a pottell of staile Ale, till the  halfe be wasted, then straine it, and keep it clean, and let the sick  drink thereof first and last, and if you lack these hearbs because of  winter, then take the roots of five-leav'd grasse, and dry them,  and make thereof a powder, then take Oyster-shells, and burne  them, and make powder also of them, and mingling them together,  let the sick use thereof in his pottage, and drink, and it  will help him.      _A Medicine for sore blood-shotten and Rhuematick  eyes._    Take ground _Ivy_, _Daises_, and _Celedony_, of each a like quantity,  stamp and straine out the juice out of them, and put to it a little  brown _Sugar_ Candy dissolved in white Rose-water, and drop two  or three drops of this liquor at one time into the grieved eye,  with a feather, lying upon the back when you doe it an hour after,  this is a most approved Medicine to take away all _Inflamations,  Spots, Webbs, Itches, Smartings_, or any griefe whatsoever in the eyes.      _A Glister to open and loosen the Body being  bound, which may safely be administred  to any man or woman._    Take _Mellowes_ and _Mercury_ unwashed, of each two handfulls,  halfe a handfull of _Barley_ clean rubbed and washed, boyle them in  a pottell of running water to a quart, then strayne out the water,  and put it in a Skillet, and put to it three spoonfulls of Sallet  Oyle, and two spoonfulls of Honey, and a little salt; then make  it luke warm, and so minister it.      _To cleanse the head, and take the Ache away._    Chew the root of _Pellitory of Spaine_, often in the mouth.      _A Medicine that hath healed old Sores upon  the leggs, that have run so long that  the bones have been seen._    Take a quantity of good sweet _Cream_, and as much _Brimstone_  beaten in fine powder, as will make it thick like Paste, then  take so much _Butter_ as will make it into the form of Oyntmemt,  and herewith annoynt the place grieved, twice a day.      _An Oyntment for a Rupture._    Take of _Sanicle_ two handfulls, of _Adders_ tongue, _Doves_ foot, and  _Shephards purse_, of each as much, of _Limaria_ one handfull, chop  them somewhat small, and boyle them in _Deers_ seuet, untill the  Hearbs doe crumble, and wax dry.      _A Barley Water to purge the Lungs and  lights of all Diseases._    Take halfe a pound of faire _Barley_, a gallon of running water,  _Licorice_ halfe an ounce, _Fennell_ seed, _Violet_ leaves, _Parsley_  seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, red _Roses_ as much, _Hysop_ and  _Sage_ dryed, a good quantity of either, _Harts tongue_ twelve leaves, a  quarter of a pound of _Figges_, and as many _Raisons_, still the _Figges_  and _Raisons_, put them all into a new earthen pot, with the water  cold, let them seeth well, and then strain the clearest from it,  drink of this a good quantity, morning and afternoone, observing  good diet upon it, it taketh away all _Agues_ that come of heat, and  all ill heat; it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#4)"],[1,"to me if no friend comes  to rescue me!' Presently Small-wit, the Jackal, who had been lurking  near, made his appearance, and standing still, he said to himself, with  a chuckle, 'O ho! my scheme bears fruit! When he is cut up, his bones,  and gristle, and blood, will fall to my share and make me some beautiful  dinners,' The Deer, here catching sight of him, exclaimed with rapture,  'Ah, friend, this is excellent! Do but gnaw these strings, and I shall  be at liberty. How charming to realize the saying!--        'That friend only is the true friend who is near when trouble comes;      That man only is the brave man who can bear the battle-drums;      Words are wind; deed proveth promise: he who helps at need is kin;      And the leal wife is loving though the husband lose or win,'    And is it not written--        'Friend and kinsman--more their meaning than the idle-hearted mind.      Many a friend can prove unfriendly, many a kinsman less than kind:      He who shares his comrade's portion, be he beggar, be he lord,      Comes as truly, comes as duly, to the battle as the board--      Stands before the king to succor, follows to the pile to sigh--      He is friend, and he is kinsman--less would make the name a lie.'    \"Small-wit answered nothing, but betook himself to examining the snare  very closely.    'This will certainly hold,' muttered he; then, turning to the Deer, he  said, 'Good friend, these strings, you see, are made of sinew, and  to-day is a fast-day, so that I cannot possibly bite them. To-morrow  morning, if you still desire it, I shall be happy to serve you,'    When he was gone, the Crow, who had missed the Deer upon returning that  evening, and had sought for him everywhere, discovered him; and seeing  his sad plight, exclaimed--    'How came this about, my friend?'    'This came,' replied the Deer, 'through disregarding a friend's advice,'    'Where is that rascal Small-wit?' asked the Crow.    'He is waiting somewhere by,' said the Deer, 'to taste my flesh,'    'Well,' sighed the Crow, 'I warned you; but it is as in the true verse--        'Stars gleam, lamps flicker, friends foretell of fate;      The fated sees, knows, hears them--all too late.'    And then, with a deeper sigh, he exclaimed,'Ah, traitor Jackal, what an  ill deed hast thou done! Smooth-tongued knave--alas!--and in the face of  the monition too--        'Absent, flatterers' tongues are daggers--present, softer than the              silk;      Shun them! 'tis a jar of poison hidden under harmless milk;      Shun them when they promise little! Shun them when they promise much!      For, enkindled, charcoal burneth--cold, it doth defile the touch.'    When the day broke, the Crow (who was still there) saw the master of the  field approaching with his club in his hand.    'Now, friend Deer,' said Sharp-sense on perceiving him, 'do thou cause  thyself to seem like one dead: puff thy belly up with wind, stiffen thy  legs out, and lie very still. I will make a show of pecking thine eyes  out with my beak; and whensoever I utter a croak, then spring to thy  feet and betake thee to flight.'    The Deer thereon placed himself exactly as the Crow suggested, and was  very soon espied by the husbandman, whose eyes opened with joy at the  sight.    'Aha!' said he, 'the fellow has died of himself,' and so speaking, he  released the Deer from the snare, and proceeded to gather and lay aside  his nets. At that instant Sharp-sense uttered a loud croak, and the Deer  sprang up and made off. And the club which the husbandman flung after  him in a rage struck Small-wit, the Jackal (who was close by), and  killed him. Is it not said, indeed?--        'In years, or moons, or half-moons three,      Or in three days--suddenly,      Knaves are shent--true men go free,'    \"Thou seest, then,\" said Golden-skin, \"there can be no friendship  between food and feeder.\"    \"I should hardly,\" replied the Crow, \"get a large breakfast out of your  worship; but as to that indeed you have nothing to fear from me. I am  not often angry, and if I were, you know--        'Anger comes to noble natures, but leaves there no strife or storm:      Plunge a lighted torch beneath it, and the ocean grows not warm.'    \"Then, also, thou art such a gad-about,\" objected the King.    \"Maybe,\" answered Light o' Leap; \"but I am bent on winning thy  friendship, and I will die at thy door of fasting if thou grantest it  not. Let us be friends! for        'Noble hearts are golden vases--close the bond true metals make;      Easily the smith may weld them, harder far it is to break.      Evil hearts are earthen vessels--at a touch they crack a-twain,      And what craftsman's ready cunning can unite the shards again?'    And then, too,        'Good men's friendships may be broken, yet abide they friends at heart;      Snap the stem of Luxmee's lotus, and its fibres will not part.'    \"Good sir,\" said the King of the Mice, \"your conversation is as pleasing  as pearl necklets or oil of sandal-wood in hot weather. Be it as you  will\"--and thereon King Golden-skin made a treaty with the Crow, and  after gratifying him with the best of his store reentered his hole. The  Crow returned to his accustomed perch:--and thenceforward the time  passed in mutual presents of food, in polite inquiries, and the most  unrestrained talk. One day Light o' Leap thus accosted Golden-skin:--    \"This is a poor place, your Majesty, for a Crow to get a living in. I  should like to leave it and go elsewhere.\"    \"Whither wouldst thou go?\" replied the King; they say,        'One foot goes, and one foot stands,      When the wise man leaves his lands.'    \"And they say, too,\" answered the Crow,        'Over-love of home were weakness; wheresoever the hero come,      Stalwart arm and steadfast spirit find or win for him a home.        Little recks the awless lion where his hunting jungles lie--      When he enters it be certain that a royal prey shall die,'    \"I know an excellent jungle now.\"    \"Which is that?\" asked the Mouse-king.    \"In the Nerbudda woods, by Camphor-water,\" replied the Crow. \"There is  an old and valued friend of mine lives there--Slow-toes his name is, a  very virtuous Tortoise; he will regale me with fish and good things.\"    \"Why should I stay behind,\" said Golden-skin, \"if thou goest? Take me  also.\"    Accordingly, the two set forth together, enjoying charming converse upon  the road. Slow-toes perceived Light o' Leap a long way off, and hastened  to do him the guest-rites, extending them to the Mouse upon Light o'  Leap's introduction.    \"Good Slow-toes,\" said he, \"this is Golden-skin, King of the Mice--pay  all honor to him--he is burdened with virtues--a very jewel-mine of  kindnesses. I don't know if the Prince of all the Serpents, with his two  thousand tongues, could rightly repeat them.\" So speaking, he told the  story of Speckle-neck. Thereupon Slow-toes made a profound obeisance to  Golden-skin, and said, \"How came your Majesty, may I ask, to retire to  an unfrequented forest?\"    \"I will tell you,\" said the King. \"You must know that in the town of  Champaka there is a college for the devotees. Unto this resorted daily a  beggar-priest, named Chudakarna, whose custom was to place his  begging-dish upon the shelf, with such alms in it as he had not eaten,  and go to sleep by it; and I, so soon as he slept, used to jump up, and  devour the meal. One day a great friend of his, named Vinakarna, also a  mendicant, came to visit him; and observed that while conversing, he  kept striking the ground with a split cane, to frighten me. 'Why don't  you listen?' said Vinakarna. 'I am listening!' replied the other; 'but  this plaguy mouse is always eating the meal out of my begging-dish,'  Vinakarna looked at the shelf and remarked, 'However can a mouse jump as  high as this? There must be a reason, though there seems none. I guess  the cause--the fellow is well off and fat,' With these words Vinakarna  snatched up a shovel, discovered my retreat, and took away all my hoard  of provisions. After that I lost strength daily, had scarcely energy  enough to get my dinner, and, in fact, crept about so wretchedly, that  when Chudakarna saw me he fell to quoting--        'Very feeble folk are poor folk; money lost takes wit away:--      All their doings fail like runnels, wasting through the summer day.'    \"Yes!\" I thought, \"he is right, and so are the sayings--        'Wealth is friends, home, father, brother--title to respect and fame;       Yea, and wealth is held for wisdom--that it should be so is shame,'      'Home is empty to the childless; hearts to them who friends deplore:--       Earth unto the idle-minded; and the three worlds to the poor.'    'I can stay here no longer; and to tell my distress to another is out of  the question--altogether out of the question!--        'Say the sages, nine things name not: Age, domestic joys and woes,      Counsel, sickness, shame, alms, penance; neither Poverty disclose.      Better for the proud of spirit, death, than life with losses told;      Fire consents to be extinguished, but submits not to be cold.'    'Verily he was wise, methought also, who wrote--        'As Age doth banish beauty,        As moonlight dies in gloom,      As Slavery's menial duty        Is Honor's certain tomb;      As Hari's name and Hara's        Spoken, charm sin away,      So Poverty can surely        A hundred virtues slay.'    'And as to sustaining myself on another man's bread, that,' I mused,  'would be but a second door of death. Say not the books the same?--        'Half-known knowledge, present pleasure purchased with a future woe,      And to taste the salt of service--greater griefs no man can know.'    'And herein, also--        'All existence is not equal, and all living is not life;      Sick men live; and he who, banished, pines for children, home, and              wife;      And the craven-hearted eater of another's leavings lives,      "]]]
