For he knew what a club meant!    McCready's face was terrible now. It was like a beast's. He was hatless.  Kazan slunk deeper in his shadow at the low horrible laugh that fell  from his lips--for the man still held the club. In a moment he dropped  that, and approached the tent. He drew back the flap and peered in.  Thorpe's wife was sleeping, and as quietly as a cat he entered and hung  the lantern on a nail in the tent-pole. His movement did not awaken her,  and for a few moments he stood there, staring--staring.    Outside, crouching in the deep shadow, Kazan tried to fathom the meaning  of these strange things that were happening. Why had his master and  McCready gone out into the forest? Why had not his master returned? It  was his master, and not McCready, who belonged in that tent. Then why  was McCready there? He watched McCready as he entered, and suddenly the  dog was on his feet, his back tense and bristling, his limbs rigid. He  saw McCready's huge shadow on the canvas, and a moment later there came  a strange piercing cry. In the wild terror of that cry he recognized  _her_ voice--and he leaped toward the tent. The leash stopped him,  choking the snarl in his throat. He saw the shadows struggling now, and  there came cry after cry. She was calling to his master, and with his  master's name she was calling _him_!    \"_Kazan_--_Kazan_--\"    He leaped again, and was thrown upon his back. A second and a third  time he sprang the length of the leash into the night, and the babiche  cord about his neck cut into his flesh like a knife. He stopped for an  instant, gasping for breath. The shadows were still fighting. Now they  were upright! Now they were crumpling down! With a fierce snarl he flung  his whole weight once more at the end of the chain. There was a snap, as  the thong about his neck gave way.    In half a dozen bounds Kazan made the tent and rushed under the flap.  With a snarl he was at McCready's throat. The first snap of his powerful  jaws was death, but he did not know that. He knew only that his mistress  was there, and that he was fighting for her. There came one choking  gasping cry that ended with a terrible sob; it was McCready. The man  sank from his knees upon his back, and Kazan thrust his fangs deeper  into his enemy's throat; he felt the warm blood.    The dog's mistress was calling to him now. She was pulling at his shaggy  neck. But he would not loose his hold--not for a long time. When he did,  his mistress looked down once upon the man and covered her face with  her hands. Then she sank down upon the blankets. She was very still. Her  face and hands were cold, and Kazan muzzled them tenderly. Her eyes were  closed. He snuggled up close against her, with his ready jaws turned  toward the dead man. Why was she so still, he wondered?    A long time passed, and then she moved. Her eyes opened. Her hand  touched him.    Then he heard a step outside.    It was his master, and with that old thrill of fear--fear of the  club--he went swiftly to the door. Yes, there was his master in the  firelight--and in his hand he held the club. He was coming slowly,  almost falling at each step, and his face was red with blood. But he had  _the club_! He would beat him again--beat him terribly for hurting  McCready; so Kazan slipped quietly under the tent-flap and stole off  into the shadows. From out the gloom of the thick spruce he looked back,  and a low whine of love and grief rose and died softly in his throat.  They would beat him always now--after _that_. Even _she_ would beat him.  They would hunt him down, and beat him when they found him.    From out of the glow of the fire he turned his wolfish head to the  depths of the forest. There were no clubs or stinging lashes out in that  gloom. They would never find him there.    For another moment he wavered. And then, as silently as one of the wild  creatures whose blood was partly his, he stole away into the blackness  of the night.          CHAPTER IV    FREE FROM BONDS      There was a low moaning of the wind in the spruce-tops as Kazan slunk  off into the blackness and mystery of the forest. For hours he lay near  the camp, his red and blistered eyes gazing steadily at the tent wherein  the terrible thing had happened a little while before.    He knew now what death was. He could tell it farther than man. He could  smell it in the air. And he knew that there was death all about him, and  that he was the cause of it. He lay on his belly in the deep snow and  shivered, and the three-quarters of him that was dog whined in a  grief-stricken way, while the quarter that was wolf still revealed  itself menacingly in his fangs, and in the vengeful glare of his eyes.    Three times the man--his master--came out of the tent, and shouted  loudly, \"Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\"    Three times the woman came with him. In the firelight Kazan could see  her shining hair streaming about her, as he had seen it in the tent,  when he had leaped up and killed the other man. In her blue eyes there  was the same wild terror, and her face was white as the snow. And the  second and third time, she too called, \"Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\"--and all  that part of him that was dog, and not wolf, trembled joyously at the  sound of her voice, and he almost crept in to take his beating. But fear  of the club was the greater, and he held back, hour after hour, until  now it was silent again in the tent, and he could no longer see their  shadows, and the fire was dying down.    Cautiously he crept out from the thick gloom, working his way on his  belly toward the packed sledge, and what remained of the burned logs.  Beyond that sledge, hidden in the darkness of the trees, was the body of  the man he had killed, covered with a blanket. Thorpe, his master, had  dragged it there.    He lay down, with his nose to the warm coals and his eyes leveled  between his forepaws, straight at the closed tent-flap. He meant to  keep awake, to watch, to be ready to slink off into the forest at the  first movement there. But a warmth was rising from out of the gray ash  of the fire-bed, and his eyes closed. Twice--three times--he fought  himself back into watchfulness; but the last time his eyes came only  half open, and closed heavily again.    And now, in his sleep, he whined softly, and the splendid muscles of his  legs and shoulders twitched, and sudden shuddering ripples ran along his  tawny spine. Thorpe, who was in the tent, if he had seen him, would have  known that he was dreaming. And Thorpe's wife, whose golden head lay  close against his breast, and who shuddered and trembled now and then  even as Kazan was doing, would have known what he was dreaming about.    In his sleep he was leaping again at the end of his chain. His jaws  snapped like castanets of steel,--and the sound awakened him, and he  sprang to his feet, his spine as stiff as a brush, and his snarling  fangs bared like ivory knives. He had awakened just in time. There was  movement in the tent. His master was awake, and if he did not escape--    He sped swiftly into the thick spruce, and paused, flat and hidden, with  only his head showing from behind a tree. He knew that his master would  not spare him. Three times Thorpe had beaten him for snapping at  McCready. The last time he would have shot him if the girl had not saved  him. And now he had torn McCready's throat. He had taken the life from  him, and his master would not spare him. Even the woman could not save  him.    Kazan was sorry that his master had returned, dazed and bleeding, after  he had torn McCready's jugular. Then he would have had her always. She  would have loved him. She did love him. And he would have followed her,  and fought for her always, and died for her when the time came. But  Thorpe had come in from the forest again, and Kazan had slunk away  quickly--for Thorpe meant to him what all men meant to him now: the  club, the whip and the strange things that spat fire and death. And  now--    Thorpe had come out from the tent. It was approaching dawn, and in his  hand he held a rifle. A moment later the girl came out, and her hand  caught the man's arm. They looked toward the thing covered by the  blanket. Then she spoke to Thorpe and he suddenly straightened and  threw back his head.    \"H-o-o-o-o--Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\" he called.    A shiver ran through Kazan. The man was trying to inveigle him back. He  had in his hand the thing that killed.    \"Kazan--Kazan--Ka-a-a-a-zan!\" he shouted again.    Kazan sneaked cautiously back from the tree. He knew that distance meant  nothing to the cold thing of death that Thorpe held in his hand. He  turned his head once, and whined softly, and for an instant a great  longing filled his reddened eyes as he saw the last of the girl.    He knew, now, that he was leaving her forever, and there was an ache in  his heart that had never been there before, a pain that was not of the  club or whip, of cold or hunger, but which was greater than them all,  and which filled him with a desire to throw back his head and cry out  his loneliness to the gray emptiness of the sky.    Back in the camp the girl's voice quivered.    \"He is gone.\"    The man's strong voice choked a little.    \"Yes, he is gone. _He knew_--and I didn't. I'd give--a year of my  life--if I hadn't whipped him yesterday and last night. He won't come  back.\"    Isobel Thorpe's hand tightened on his arm.    \"He will!\" she cried. \"He won't leave me. He loved me, if he was savage  and terrible. And he knows that I love him. He'll come back--\"    \"Listen!\"    From deep in the forest there came a long wailing howl, filled with a  plaintive sadness. It was Kazan's farewell to the woman.    After that cry Kazan sat for a long time on his haunches, sniffing the  new freedom of the air, and watching the deep black pits in the forest  about him, as they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#4)"],[1," connection  with the prosecution of suits against them.    The passage of this measure had the effect of reopening former  conflicts, the patrician elements becoming greatly alarmed at what they  regarded as a fresh encroachment upon their hereditary rights. The  contest was long and bitter, each side either bringing forward or  rejecting again and again the same measures or the same representatives.    Finally, compromises were made, and in the year B.C. 452 a commission of  ten men, called _decemvirs_, constituting the _Decemvirate_, was chosen,  consisting wholly of patricians, who entered with great efficiency upon  the discharge of legislative duties which resulted in the production of  a new code. This was approved by the senate and by the popular  representatives, and was published in the form of ten copper plates or  tables, which were affixed to the speaker's pulpit in the Forum. Among  the new decemvirs appointed in the year B.C. 450 were several plebeians,  the first official representatives of the entire people who were chosen  from that class.)      The patrician burgesses endeavored to wrest independence from the  \"plebs\" after the battle of Lake Regillus; and the latter, ruined by  constant wars with the neighboring nations, being compelled to make good  their losses by borrowing money from patrician creditors, and liable to  become bondsmen in default of payment, at length deserted the city, and  only returned on condition of being protected by tribunes of their own;  they then, by the firmness of Publilius Volero and Laetorius, obtained  the right of electing these tribunes at their own assembly, the \"Comitia  of the Tribes.\" Finally the great consul Spurius Cassius endeavored to  relieve the commonalty by an agrarian law, so as to better their  condition permanently.    The execution of the Agrarian law was constantly evaded. But on the  conquest of Antium from the Volscians, in the year B.C. 468, a colony  was sent thither, and this was one of the first examples of a  distribution of public land to poorer citizens; which answered two  purposes--the improvement of their condition, and the defence of the  place against the enemy.    Nor did the tribunes, now made altogether independent of the patricians,  fail to assert their power. One of the first persons who felt the force  of their arm was the second Appius Claudius. This Sabine noble,  following his father's example, had, after the departure of the Fabii,  led the opposition to the Publilian law. When he took the field against  the Volscians, his soldiers would not fight, and the stern commander put  to death every tenth man in his legions. For the acts of his consulship  he was brought to trial by the tribunes M. Duillius and C. Sicinius.  Seeing that conviction was certain, the proud patrician avoided  humiliation by suicide.    Nevertheless the border wars still continued, and the plebeians suffered  much. To the evils of debt and want were added about this time the  horrors of pestilential disease, which visited the Roman territory  several times at that period. In one year (B.C. 464) the two consuls,  two of the four augurs, and the curio Maximus, who was the head of all  the patricians, were swept off--a fact which implies the death of a vast  number of less distinguished persons. The government was administered by  the plebeian aediles, under the control of senatorial interreges. The  Volscians and Aequians ravaged the country up to the walls of Rome; and  the safety of the city must be attributed to the Latins and Hernici, not  to the men of Rome.    Meantime the tribunes had in vain demanded a full execution of the  Agrarian law. But in the year B.C. 462, one of the Sacred College, by  name C. Terentilius Harsa, came forward with a bill, the object of which  was to give the plebeians a surer footing in the state. This man  perceived that as long as the consuls retained their almost despotic  power, and were elected by the influence of the patricians, this order  had it in its power to thwart all measures, even after they were passed,  which tended to advance the interests of the plebeians. He therefore no  longer demanded the execution of the Agrarian law, but proposed that a  commission of ten men (_decemviri_) should be appointed to draw up  constitutional laws for regulating the future relations of the  patricians and plebeians.    The Reform Bill of Terentilius was, as might be supposed, vehemently  resisted by the patrician burgesses. But the plebeians supported their  champion no less warmly. For five consecutive years the same tribunes  were reelected and in vain endeavored to carry the bill. This was the  time which least fulfils the character which we have claimed for the  Roman people--patience and temperance, combined with firmness in their  demands. To prevent the tribunes from carrying their law, the younger  patricians thronged to the assemblies and interfered with all  proceedings; Terentilius, they said, was endeavoring to confound all  distinction between the orders. Some scenes occurred which seem to show  that both sides were prepared for civil war.    In the year B.C. 460 the city was alarmed by hearing that the Capitol  had been seized by a band of Sabines and exiled Romans, under the  command of one Herdonius. Who these exiles were is uncertain. But we  know, by the legend of Cincinnatus, that Caeso Quinctius, the son of that  old hero, was an exile. It has been inferred, therefore, that he was  among them, that the tribunes had succeeded in banishing from the city  the most violent of their opponents, and that these persons had not  scrupled to associate themselves with Sabines to recover their homes.  The consul Valerius, aided by the Latins of Tusculum, levied an army to  attack the insurgents, on condition that after success the law should be  fully considered. The exiles were driven out and Herdonius was killed.  But the consul fell in the assault, and the patricians, led by old  Cincinnatus, refused to fulfil his promises.    Then followed the danger of the AEquian invasion, to which the legend of  Cincinnatus, as given above, refers. The stern old man used his  dictatorial power quite as much to crush the tribunes at home as to  conquer the enemies abroad.    One of the historians tells us that in this period of seditious violence  many of the leading plebeians were assassinated (as the tribune Genucius  had been), and to this time only can be attributed the horrible story,  mentioned by more than one writer, that nine tribunes were burned alive  at the instance of their colleague Mucius. Society was utterly  disorganized. The two orders were on the brink of civil war. It seemed  as if Rome was to become the city of discord, not of law. Happily, there  were moderate men in both orders. Now, as at the time of the secession,  their voices prevailed, and a compromise was arranged.    In the eighth year after the first promulgation of the Terentilian law,  this compromise was made (B.C. 454). The law itself was no longer  pressed by the tribunes. The patricians, on the other hand, so far gave  way as to allow three men (_triumviri_) to be appointed, who were to  travel into Greece, and bring back a copy of the laws of Solon, as well  as the laws and institutes of any other Greek states which they might  deem good and useful. These were to be the groundwork of a new code of  laws, such as should give fair and equal rights to both orders and  restrain the arbitrary power of the patrician magistrates.    Another concession made by the patrician lords was a small installment of  the Agrarian law. L. Icilius, tribune of the plebs, proposed that all  the Aventine hill, being public land, should be made over to the plebs,  to be their quarter forever, as the other hills were occupied by the  patricians and their clients. This hill, it will be remembered, was  consecrated to the goddess Diana (Jana), and though included in the  walls of Servius, was yet not within the sacred limits (_pomoerium_) of  the patrician city. After some opposition the patricians suffered this  Icilian law to pass, in hopes of soothing the anger of the plebeians.  The land was parcelled out into building-sites. But as there was not  enough to give a separate plot to every plebeian householder that wished  to live in the city, one allotment was assigned to several persons, who  built a joint house _flats_ or stories, each of which was inhabited--as  in Edinburgh and in most foreign towns--by a separate family.    The three men who had been sent into Greece returned in the third year  (B.C. 452). They found the city free from domestic strife, partly from  the concessions already made, partly from expectation of what was now to  follow, and partly from the effect of a pestilence which had broken out  anew.    So far did moderate counsels now prevail among the patricians, that  after some little delay they agreed to suspend the ordinary government  by the consuls and other officers, and in their stead to appoint a  council of ten, who were, during their existence, to be intrusted with  all the functions of government. But they were to have a double duty:  they were not only an administrative, but also a legislative council. On  the one hand, they were to conduct the government, administer justice,  and command the armies. On the other, they were to draw up a code of  laws by which equal justice was to be dealt out to the whole Roman  people, to patricians and plebeians alike, and by which especially the  authority to be exercised by the consuls, or chief magistrates, was to  be clearly determined and settled.    This supreme council of ten, or decemvirs, was first appointed in the  year B.C. 450. They were all patricians. At their head stood Appius  Claudius and T. Genucius, who had already been chosen consuls for this  memorable year. This Appius Claudius (the third of his name) was son and  grandson of those two patrician chiefs who had "]]]
