Our  conversation was a difficult thing, if I wanted to avoid touching on  topics which could not but affect painfully the man whom God's mighty  hand had cast down.\" And more than once has he given vent to  reflections like these: \"For him who does not believe--as I do from  the bottom of my heart--that death is a transition from one existence  to another, and that we are justified in holding out to the worst of  criminals in his dying hour the comforting assurance, _mors janua  vitae_--I say that for him who does not share that conviction the joys  of this life must possess so high a value that I could almost envy him  the sensations they must procure him.\" Or these: \"Twenty years hence,  or at most thirty, we shall be past the troubles of this life, whilst  our children will have reached our present standpoint, and will  discover with astonishment that their existence, but now so brightly  begun, has turned the corner and is going down hill. Were that to be  the end of it all, life would not be worth the trouble of dressing and  undressing every day.\"    IV    We have considered a few traits of Bismarck's mental and moral make-up  which seem to be closely allied with German national character and  traditions. But, after all, the personality of a man like Bismarck is  not exhausted by the qualities which he has in common with his people,  however sublimated these qualities may be in him. His innermost life  belongs to himself alone, or is shared, at most, by the few men of the  world's history who, like him, tower in splendid solitude above the  waste of the ages. In the Middle High German _Alexanderlied_ there is  an episode which most impressively brings out the impelling motive of  such titanic lives. On one of his expeditions Alexander penetrates  into the land of Scythian barbarians. These child-like people are so  contented with their simple, primitive existence that they beseech  Alexander to give them immortality. He answers that this is not in his  power. Surprised, they ask why, then, if he is only a mortal, he is  making such a stir in the world. Thereupon he answers: \"The Supreme  Power has ordained us to carry out what is in us. The sea is given  over to the whirlwind to plough it up. As long as life lasts and I am  master of my senses, I must bring forth what is in me. What would life  be if all men in the world were like you?\" These words might have been  spoken by Bismarck. Every word, every act of his public career, gives  us the impression of a man irresistibly driven on by some  overwhelming, mysterious power. He was not an ambitious schemer, like  Beaconsfield or Napoleon; he was not a moral enthusiast like Gladstone  or Cavour. If he had consulted his private tastes and inclinations, he  would never have wielded the destinies of an empire. Indeed, he often  rebelled against his task; again and again he tried to shake it off;  and the only thing which again and again brought him back to it was  the feeling, \"I must; I cannot do otherwise.\" If ever there was a man  in whom Fate revealed its moral sovereignty, that man was Bismarck.    Whither has he gone now? Has he joined his compeers? Is he conversing  in ethereal regions with Alexander, Caesar, Frederick? Is he sweeping  over land and sea in the whirlwind and the thunder-cloud? Or may we  hope that he is still working out the task which, in spite of all the  imperiousness of his nature, was the essence of his earthly life--the  task of making the Germans a nation of true freemen?

LEWIS      Hotel de Prusse, Stettin, (Not dated: Written about the end of  December, 1846.)    TO HERR VON PUTTKAMER:    _Most Honored Sir_.--I begin this communication by indicating its  content in the first sentence--it is a request for the highest thing  you can dispose of in this world, the hand of your daughter. I do not  conceal from myself the fact that I appear presumptuous when I, whom  you have come to know only recently and through a few meetings, claim  the strongest proof of confidence which you can give to any man. I  know, however, that even irrespective of all obstacles in space and  time which can increase your difficulty in forming an opinion of me,  through my own efforts I can never be in a position to give you such  guaranties for the future that they would, from your point of view,  justify intrusting me with an object so precious, unless you  supplement by trust in God that which trust in human beings cannot  supply. All that I can do is to give you information about myself with  absolute candor, so far as I have come to understand myself. It will  be easy for you to get reports from others in regard to my public  conduct; I content myself, therefore, with an account of what underlay  that--my inner life, and especially my relations to Christianity. To  do that I must take a start far back.    In earliest childhood I was estranged from my parents' house, and at  no time became entirely at home there again; and my education from the  beginning was conducted on the assumption that everything is  subordinate to the cultivation of the intelligence and the early  acquisition of positive sciences.    After a course of religious teaching, irregularly attended and not  comprehended, I had at the time of my confirmation by Schleiermacher,  on my sixteenth birthday no belief other than a bare deism, which was  not long free from pantheistic elements. It was at about this time  that I, not through indifference, but after mature consideration,  ceased to pray every evening, as I had been in the habit of doing  since childhood; because prayer seemed inconsistent with my view of  God's nature; saying to myself: either God himself, being omnipresent,  is the cause of everything--even of every thought and volition of  mine--and so in a sense offers prayers to himself through me, or, if  my will is independent of God's will, it implies arrogance and a doubt  as to the inflexibility as well as the perfection of the divine  determination to believe that it can be influenced by human appeals.  When not quite seventeen years old I went to Goettingen University.  During the next eight years I seldom saw the home of my parents; my  father indulgently refrained from interference; my mother censured me  from far away when I neglected my studies and professional work,  probably in the conviction that she must leave the rest to guidance  from above: with this exception I was literally cut off from the  counsel and instruction of others. In this period, when studies which  ambition at times led me to prosecute zealously--or emptiness and  satiety, the inevitable companions of my way of living--brought me  nearer to the real meaning of life and eternity, it was in old-world  philosophies, uncomprehended writings of Hegel, and particularly in  Spinoza's seeming mathematical clearness, that I sought for peace of  mind in that which the human understanding cannot comprehend. But it  was loneliness that first led me to reflect on these things  persistently, when I went to Kniephof, after my mother's death, five  or six years ago. Though at first my views did not materially change  at Kniephof, yet conscience began to be more audible in the solitude,  and to represent that many a thing was wrong which I had before  regarded as permissible. Yet my struggle for insight was still  confined to the circle of the understanding, and led me, while reading  such writings as those of Strauss, Feuerbach, and Bruno Bauer, only  deeper into the blind alley of doubt.    I was firmly convinced that God has denied to man the possibility of  true knowledge; that it is presumption to claim to understand the will  and plans of the Lord of the World; that the individual must await in  submission the judgment that his Creator will pass upon him in death,  and that the will of God becomes known to us on earth solely through  conscience, which He has given us as a special organ for feeling our  way through the gloom of the world. That I found no peace in these  views I need not say. Many an hour have I spent in disconsolate  depression, thinking that my existence and that of others is  purposeless and unprofitable--perchance only a casual product of  creation, coming and going like dust from rolling wheels.    About four years ago I came into close companionship, for the first  time since my school-days, with Moritz Blankenburg, and found in him,  what I had never had till then in my life, a friend; but the warm zeal  of his love strove in vain to give me by persuasion and discussion  what I lacked--faith. But through Moritz I made acquaintance with the  Triglaf family and the social circle around it, and found in it people  who made me ashamed that, with the scanty light of my understanding, I  had undertaken to investigate things which such superior intellects  accepted as true and holy with childlike trust. I saw that the members  of this circle were, in their outward life, almost perfect models of  what I wished to be. That confidence and peace dwelt in them did not  surprise me, for I had never doubted that these were companions of  belief; but belief cannot be had for the asking, and I thought I must  wait submissively to see whether it would come to me. I soon felt at  home in that circle, and was conscious of a satisfaction that I had  not before experienced--a family life that included me, almost a home.    I was meanwhile brought into contact with certain events in which I  was not an active participant, and which, as other people's secrets, I  cannot communicate to you, but which stirred me deeply. Their  practical result was that the consciousness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#4)"],[1," simply the Hero,  the one who we used to say was as brave as d'Artagnan, as strong as  Porthos....\"    \"And as mysterious as Monte Cristo,\" said the Prefect of Police,  laughing. \"I have all this in the report which I received from the Fourth  Regiment of the Foreign Legion. It is not necessary to read the whole of  it; but it contains the unprecedented fact that Private Perenna, in the  space of two years' time, received the military medal, received the  Legion of Honour for exceptional services, and was mentioned fourteen  times in dispatches. I will pick out a detail here and there.\"    \"Monsieur le Prefet, I beg of you,\" protested Don Luis. \"These are  trivial matters, of no interest to anybody; and I do not see the  reason....\"    \"There is every reason, on the contrary,\" declared M. Desmalions. \"You  gentlemen are here not only to hear a will read, but also to authorize  its execution as regards the only one of its clauses that is to be  carried out at once, the payment of a legacy of a million francs. It  is necessary, therefore, that all of you should know what there is to  know of the personality of the legatee. Consequently, I propose to  continue ...\"    \"In that case, Monsieur le Prefet,\" said Perenna, rising and making for  the door, \"you will allow me ...\"    \"Right about turn! Halt! ... Eyes front!\" commanded Major d'Astrignac in  a jesting tone.    He dragged Don Luis back to the middle of the room and forced him  into a chair.    \"Monsieur le Prefet,\" he said, \"I plead for mercy for my old  comrade-in-arms, whose modesty would really be put to too severe a test  if the story of his prowess were read out in front of him. Besides, the  report is here; and we can all of us consult it for ourselves. Without  having seen it, I second every word of praise that it contains; and I  declare that, in the course of my whole military career, I have never met  a soldier who could compare with Private Perenna. And yet I saw plenty of  fine fellows over there, the sort of demons whom you only find in the  Legion and who will get themselves cut to bits for the sheer pleasure of  the thing, for the lark of it, as they say, just to astonish one another.    \"But not one of them came anywhere near Perenna. The chap whom we  nicknamed d'Artagnan, Porthos, and de Bussy deserved to be classed with  the most amazing heroes of legend and history. I have seen him perform  feats which I should not care to relate, for fear of being treated as an  impostor; feats so improbable that to-day, in my calmer moments, I wonder  if I am quite sure that I did see them. One day, at Settat, as we were  being pursued--\"    \"Another word, Major,\" cried Don Luis, gayly, \"and this time I really  will go out! I must say you have a nice way of sparing my modesty!\"    \"My dear Perenna,\" replied Comte d'Astrignac, \"I always told you that you  had every good quality and only one fault, which was that you were not a  Frenchman.\"    \"And I always answered, Major, that I was French on my mother's side and  a Frenchman in heart and temperament. There are things which only a  Frenchman can do.\"    The two men again gripped each other's hands affectionately.    \"Come,\" said the Prefect, \"we'll say no more of your feats of prowess,  Monsieur, nor of this report. I will mention one thing, however, which is  that, after two years, you fell into an ambush of forty Berbers, that you  were captured, and that you did not rejoin the Legion until last month.\"    \"Just so, Monsieur le Prefet, in time to receive my discharge, as my five  years' service was up.\"    \"But how did Mr. Cosmo Mornington come to mention you in his will, when,  at the time when he was making it, you had disappeared from view for  eighteen months?\"    \"Cosmo and I used to correspond.\"    \"What!\"    \"Yes; and I had informed him of my approaching escape and my return  to Paris.\"    \"But how did you manage it? Where were you? And how did you find the  means? ...\"    Don Luis smiled without answering.    \"Monte Cristo, this time,\" said M. Desmalions. \"The mysterious  Monte Cristo.\"    \"Monte Cristo, if you like, Monsieur le Prefet. In point of fact, the  mystery of my captivity and escape is a rather strange one. It may be  interesting to throw some light upon it one of these days. Meanwhile, I  must ask for a little credit.\"    A silence ensued. M. Desmalions once more inspected this curious  individual; and he could not refrain from saying, as though in obedience  to an association of ideas for which he himself was unable to account:    \"One word more, and one only. What were your comrades' reasons for giving  you that rather odd nickname of Arsene Lupin? Was it just an allusion to  your pluck, to your physical strength?\"    \"There was something besides, Monsieur le Prefet: the discovery of a very  curious theft, of which certain details, apparently incapable of  explanation, had enabled me to name the perpetrator.\"    \"So you have a gift for that sort of thing?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, a certain knack which I had the opportunity of  employing in Africa on more than one occasion. Hence my nickname of  Arsene Lupin. It was soon after the death of the man himself, you know,  and he was much spoken of at the time.\"    \"Was it a serious theft?\"    \"It was rather; and it happened to be committed upon Cosmo Mornington,  who was then living in the Province of Oran. That was really what started  our relations.\"    There was a fresh silence; and Don Luis added:    \"Poor Cosmo! That incident gave him an unshakable confidence in my little  detective talents. He was always saying, 'Perenna, if I die murdered'--he  had a fixed notion in his head that he would meet with a violent  death--'if I die murdered, swear that you will pursue the culprit.'\"    \"His presentiment was not justified,\" said the Prefect of Police. \"Cosmo  Mornington was not murdered.\"    \"That's where you make a mistake, Monsieur le Prefet,\" said Don Luis.    M. Desmalions gave a start.    \"What! What's that? Cosmo Mornington--?\"    \"I say that Cosmo Mornington did not die, as you think, of a carelessly  administered injection, but that he died, as he feared he would, by  foul play.\"    \"But, Monsieur, your assertion is based on no evidence whatever!\"    \"It is based on fact, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Were you there? Do you know anything?\"    \"I was not there. A month ago I was still with the colours. I even admit  that, when I arrived in Paris, not having seen the newspapers regularly,  I did not know of Cosmo's death. In fact, I learned it from you just now,  Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"In that case, Monsieur, you cannot know more about it than I do, and you  must accept the verdict of the doctor.\"    \"I am sorry, but his verdict fails to satisfy me.\"    \"But look here, Monsieur, what prompts you to make the accusation? Have  you any evidence?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What evidence?\"    \"Your own words, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"My own words? What do you mean?\"    \"I will tell you, Monsieur le Prefet. You began by saying that Cosmo  Mornington had taken up medicine and practised it with great skill;  next, you said that he had given himself an injection which,  carelessly administered, set up inflammation and caused his death  within a few hours.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, Monsieur le Prefet, I maintain that a man who practises medicine  with great skill and who is accustomed to treating sick people, as Cosmo  Mornington was, is incapable of giving himself a hypodermic injection  without first taking every necessary antiseptic precaution. I have seen  Cosmo at work, and I know how he set about things.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, the doctor just wrote a certificate as any doctor will when there  is no sort of clue to arouse his suspicions.\"    \"So your opinion is--\"    \"Maitre Lepertuis,\" asked Perenna, turning to the solicitor, \"did you  notice nothing unusual when you were summoned to Mr. Mornington's  death-bed?\"    \"No, nothing. Mr. Mornington was in a state of coma.\"    \"It's a strange thing in itself,\" observed Don Luis, \"that an injection,  however badly administered, should produce such rapid results. Were there  no signs of suffering?\"    \"No ... or rather, yes.... Yes, I remember the face showed brown patches  which I did not see on the occasion of my first visit.\"    \"Brown patches? That confirms my supposition Cosmo Mornington was  poisoned.\"    \"But how?\" exclaimed the Prefect.    \"By some substance introduced into one of the phials of  glycero-phosphate, or into the syringe which the sick man employed.\"    \"But the doctor?\" M. Desmalions objected.    \"Maitre Lepertuis,\" Perenna continued, \"did you call the doctor's  attention to those brown patches?\"    \"Yes, but he attached no importance to them.\"    \"Was it his ordinary medical adviser?\"    \"No, his ordinary medical adviser, Doctor Pujol, who happens to be a  friend of mine and who had recommended me to him as a solicitor, was ill.  The doctor whom I saw at his death-bed must have been a local  practitioner.\"    \"I have his name and address here,\" said the Prefect of Police, who had  turned up the certificate. \"Doctor Bellavoine, 14 Rue d'Astorg.\"    \"Have you a medical directory, Monsieur le Prefet?\"    M. Desmalions opened a directory and turned over the pages. Presently  he declared:    \"There is no Doctor Bellavoine; and there is no doctor living at 14 Rue  d'Astorg.\"          CHAPTER TWO    A MAN DEAD      The declaration was followed by a silence of some length. The Secretary  of the American Embassy and the Peruvian attache had followed the  conversation with eager interest. Major d'Astrignac nodded his head with  an air of approval. To his mind, Perenna could not be mistaken.    The Prefect of Police confessed:    \"Certainly, certainly ... we have a number of circumstances here ... that  are fairly ambiguous.... Those brown patches; that doctor.... It's a case  that wants looking into.\" And, questioning Don Luis Perenna as though in  spite of himself, he asked, \"No doubt, in "]]]
