There was,  however, another one present that the blind men had no suspicion of, and  that was the raccoon, who had now noiselessly come into the wigwam and  greedily sat watching the preparations. This dinner consisted of eight  pieces of meat which, when cooked, were placed in their _rogan_, or wooden  bowl. When ready they sat down with this bowl between them and began to  eat. Each took a piece of meat, and they talked of various things while  they ate.    \"The raccoon now noiselessly took four of the pieces of meat out of the  bowl and began eating them. Soon one of the men reached into the bowl, to  get another piece of meat, and finding only two pieces left, he said:    \"'My brother, you must be very hungry, to eat so fast. I have only had one  piece of meat, and there are only two left.'    \"'I have not taken them,' was the reply, 'but I suspect that you are the  greedy one who has eaten them.'    \"This made the other brother very angry, and as they thus went on arguing,  the raccoon, to make matters worse, and to have, as he told Nanahboozhoo,  some more sport with the old blind fellows, hit each of them a smart blow  on the face. The poor old men, each believing that the other had struck  him, began to fight; and so they upset the _rogan_ and lost the rest of  their dinner and nearly set the wigwam on fire.    \"The raccoon then seized the two remaining pieces of meat and the bowl,  and, with shouts of laughter, rushed out of the wigwam. The old men,  hearing this, perceived that they had been fooled, and they at once stopped  fighting and apologized to each other.    \"The raccoon's rascally trick made Nanahboozhoo very angry. Indeed he had  had a good deal of trouble to keep from letting the raccoon know who he  was. So just as soon as the raccoon had finished he said:    \"'I am Nanahboozhoo. Those old blind men are my brothers, and I'll teach  you a lesson you will never forget!'    \"So he seized the raccoon and killed him, and carried his body back to the  tent of the blind men and made out of it a great feast for them, and  declared that in future the old raccoons should have to carry as many  circles on their tails as pieces of meat that had been stolen out of the  _rogan_ of the blind men.\"    \"Good for Nanahboozhoo!\" shouted Sagastao. \"Mr. Raccoon couldn't play any  tricks on him. Now tell us another story.\"    But here Minnehaha interposed.    \"I think,\" said she, \"we had better go home now, for father and mother may  begin to think they have lost their little ones.\"    \"Let us wait until dark,\" said Sagastao, \"and then Mary won't see our dirty  clothes!\" For their greasy fingers had soiled them badly.    The wishes of the little girl, however, prevailed, and so it was not long  ere the Indian salutations, \"Wat cheer! Wat cheer!\" were shouted to all,  and once more the two children were hoisted upon the shoulders of the big  Indians, and in the same manner in which they had been brought to the  wigwam in the forenoon they rode home in the beautiful gloaming.    Very tired were they, yet not so weary but that they were able with their  little hands to rub some of the paint off the faces of their big stalwart  carriers and daub it on their own. The effect was so ludicrous that their  merry laughter reached the ears of their expectant parents even before they  emerged from the gloom of the forest.          CHAPTER II.      The Children's Return--Indignation of Mary, the Indian  Nurse--Her Pathetic History--Her Love for the Children--The  Story of Wakonda, and of the Origin of Mosquitoes.    In reaching home the children were quietly received by their parents, who,  understanding Indian ways, had no desire to lessen their influence by  finding fault with them for carrying off the children. They treated the  matter as though it were one of everyday occurrence.    Mary, the Indian nurse, however, did not regard the incident so calmly.  When the children were brought back dirty, greasy, bedaubed, and so tired  that they could hardly hold up their little heads, her indignation knew no  bounds, and as she was perfectly fearless she couched her sentiments in the  most vigorous phrases of the expressive Cree language.    The history of Indian Mary was very strange. Indeed there was an incident  in her life so sad that from the day of her recovery she was considered to  be under the special care of the Good Spirit, so that even the most  influential chiefs or hunters had a superstitious fear of showing any  temper, or making any bitter retort, no matter what she might say.    Years before this time Mary was the wife of a cruel pagan Indian who bore  the English name of Robinson. Although she was slight of figure, and never  very strong, he exacted from Mary a great deal of hard work and was vexed  and angry if, when heavily burdened with the game he had shot, she did not  move as rapidly along on the trail as he did, carrying only his gun and  ammunition.    Once, when they were out in the woods some miles from his wigwam, he shot a  full-grown deer and ordered her to bring it into the camp on her back.  Picking up his gun he started on ahead, and being a large, stalwart man,  and moving with the usual rapidity of the Indians on the homeward trail, he  soon reached his wigwam. Unfortunately for him--and, as it turned out, for  Mary also--he found some free-traders[1] at his abode awaiting his return.  They had few goods for trade in their outfit, but they had a keg of fire  water, which has ever been the scourge of the Indians.    [Footnote 1: Fur buyers who were not agents of the Fur Company.]    Robinson informed them of his success in shooting the deer and that it was  even now being brought in. The traders not only purchased what furs  Robinson had on hand but also the two hind quarters of the deer which Mary  was bringing home. Robinson at once began drinking the fire water which he  had received as part payment.    He was naturally irritable, and short-tempered even when sober, but he was  much more so when under the influence of spirituous liquors. The  unprincipled traders, knowing this, and wishing to see him in one of his  tantrums, began in a bantering way to question whether he had really shot a  deer, since his wife was so long in coming with it.    This made him simply furious, and when Mary did at length arrive, laboring  under the two-hundred-pound deer, she was met by her husband now wild with  passion and the white man's fire water. Little suspecting danger she threw  the deer from her shoulders, where it had been supported by the carrying  strap across her forehead. Weary and panting, she turned to go into the  wigwam for her skinning knife, but ere she had gone a dozen steps she was  startled by a yell from Robinson which caused her instantly to turn and  face him. The sight that met her eyes was appalling. Before her stood her  husband with an uplifted gleaming ax in his hands and curses on his tongue.  Seeing that there was no chance to fly from him she threw herself toward  him, hoping thereby to escape the blow. She succeeded in saving her head,  but the ax buried itself in her spine.    Mary's piercing screams speedily brought a number of Indians from  neighboring wigwams. When they found poor Mary lying there in agony, with  the ax still imbedded in the bones of her back, their indignation knew no  bounds.    Indians, as a rule, have great self-control, but this sight so stirred them  that there was very nearly a lynching. Robinson, now sobered by his fears,  clearly foresaw that terrible would be his punishment, and while the  Indians and traders turned to attend to Mary's wounds the wretched husband  stealthily slipped away into the forest and was never again seen there.  Rumors, however, at length reached Mary that he had fled away to the  distant Kaministiquia River, where for a time he lived, solitary and alone,  in a little bark wigwam. One day, when out shooting in his canoe, he was  caught in some treacherous rapids and carried over the wild and picturesque  Ka-ka-be-ka Falls, about which so many thrilling Indian legends cluster.    For seven years Mary was a helpless invalid. When she did recover her back  had so curved that she looked like a hunchback. As she was poor, and  utterly unable either to hunt or to fish, we helped her in various ways.  She was always grateful for kindness, and in return was very willing to do  what she could for us. She was exceedingly clever with her needle, and with  a little instruction was soon able to assist with the sewing required.  However, what especially won her to us and gave her a permanent place in  our home, was her great love and devotion to our little ones.    [Illustration: \"The wild and picturesque Ka-ka-be-ka Falls.\"]    Little Sagastao was only a few months old when she installed herself as his  nurse, and for years she was a most watchful and devoted as well as  self-sacrificing guardian of our children in that Northern home. She seemed  to live and think solely for them. At times, especially in the matter of  parental discipline, there would be collisions between Mary and the mother  of the children; for the nurse, with her Indian ideas, could not accept  of the position of a disciplined servant, nor could she quietly witness the  punishment of children whom she thought absolutely perfect. Hence, if she  could not have things exactly as she wanted them, Mary would now and then  allow her fiery temper to obtain the mastery, and springing up in a rage  and throwing a shawl over her head she would fly out of the house and be  gone for days.    Her mistress paid no attention to these outbursts. She well knew that when  Mary had cooled down she would return, and it was often amusing to see the  way in which she would attract the children's attention to her, peering  around tree or corner, and then come meekly walking in with them as though  they had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10897"],[0,"The Wendigo (#4)"],[1,"that--blackness, and,  so far as he could tell, a silence of death. Just behind them a passing  puff of wind lifted a single leaf, looked at it, then laid it softly  down again without disturbing the rest of the covey. It seemed as if a  million invisible causes had combined just to produce that single  visible effect. _Other_ life pulsed about them--and was gone.    Defago turned abruptly; the livid hue of his face had turned to a dirty  grey.    \"I never said I heered--or smelt--nuthin',\" he said slowly and  emphatically, in an oddly altered voice that conveyed somehow a touch of  defiance. \"I was only--takin' a look round--so to speak. It's always a  mistake to be too previous with yer questions.\" Then he added suddenly  with obvious effort, in his more natural voice, \"Have you got the  matches, Boss Simpson?\" and proceeded to light the pipe he had half  filled just before he began to sing.    Without speaking another word they sat down again by the fire. Defago  changing his side so that he could face the direction the wind came  from. For even a tenderfoot could tell that. Defago changed his position  in order to hear and smell--all there was to be heard and smelt. And,  since he now faced the lake with his back to the trees it was evidently  nothing in the forest that had sent so strange and sudden a warning to  his marvelously trained nerves.    \"Guess now I don't feel like singing any,\" he explained presently of his  own accord. \"That song kinder brings back memories that's troublesome to  me; I never oughter've begun it. It sets me on t' imagining things,  see?\"    Clearly the man was still fighting with some profoundly moving emotion.  He wished to excuse himself in the eyes of the other. But the  explanation, in that it was only a part of the truth, was a lie, and he  knew perfectly well that Simpson was not deceived by it. For nothing  could explain away the livid terror that had dropped over his face while  he stood there sniffing the air. And nothing--no amount of blazing fire,  or chatting on ordinary subjects--could make that camp exactly as it had  been before. The shadow of an unknown horror, naked if unguessed, that  had flashed for an instant in the face and gestures of the guide, had  also communicated itself, vaguely and therefore more potently, to his  companion. The guide's visible efforts to dissemble the truth only made  things worse. Moreover, to add to the younger man's uneasiness, was the  difficulty, nay, the impossibility he felt of asking questions, and also  his complete ignorance as to the cause ...Indians, wild animals, forest  fires--all these, he knew, were wholly out of the question. His  imagination searched vigorously, but in vain....           *       *       *       *       *    Yet, somehow or other, after another long spell of smoking, talking and  roasting themselves before the great fire, the shadow that had so  suddenly invaded their peaceful camp began to shift. Perhaps Defago's  efforts, or the return of his quiet and normal attitude accomplished  this; perhaps Simpson himself had exaggerated the affair out of all  proportion to the truth; or possibly the vigorous air of the wilderness  brought its own powers of healing. Whatever the cause, the feeling of  immediate horror seemed to have passed away as mysteriously as it had  come, for nothing occurred to feed it. Simpson began to feel that he had  permitted himself the unreasoning terror of a child. He put it down  partly to a certain subconscious excitement that this wild and immense  scenery generated in his blood, partly to the spell of solitude, and  partly to overfatigue. That pallor in the guide's face was, of course,  uncommonly hard to explain, yet it _might_ have been due in some way to  an effect of firelight, or his own imagination ...He gave it the benefit  of the doubt; he was Scotch.    When a somewhat unordinary emotion has disappeared, the mind always  finds a dozen ways of explaining away its causes ...Simpson lit a last  pipe and tried to laugh to himself. On getting home to Scotland it would  make quite a good story. He did not realize that this laughter was a  sign that terror still lurked in the recesses of his soul--that, in  fact, it was merely one of the conventional signs by which a man,  seriously alarmed, tries to persuade himself that he is _not_ so.    Defago, however, heard that low laughter and looked up with surprise on  his face. The two men stood, side by side, kicking the embers about  before going to bed. It was ten o'clock--a late hour for hunters to be  still awake.    \"What's ticklin' yer?\" he asked in his ordinary tone, yet gravely.    \"I--I was thinking of our little toy woods at home, just at that  moment,\" stammered Simpson, coming back to what really dominated his  mind, and startled by the question, \"and comparing them to--to all  this,\" and he swept his arm round to indicate the Bush.    A pause followed in which neither of them said anything.    \"All the same I wouldn't laugh about it, if I was you,\" Defago added,  looking over Simpson's shoulder into the shadows. \"There's places in  there nobody won't never see into--nobody knows what lives in there  either.\"    \"Too big--too far off?\" The suggestion in the guide's manner was immense  and horrible.    Defago nodded. The expression on his face was dark. He, too, felt  uneasy. The younger man understood that in a _hinterland_ of this size  there might well be depths of wood that would never in the life of the  world be known or trodden. The thought was not exactly the sort he  welcomed. In a loud voice, cheerfully, he suggested that it was time for  bed. But the guide lingered, tinkering with the fire, arranging the  stones needlessly, doing a dozen things that did not really need doing.  Evidently there was something he wanted to say, yet found it difficult  to \"get at.\"    \"Say, you, Boss Simpson,\" he began suddenly, as the last shower of  sparks went up into the air, \"you don't--smell nothing, do you--nothing  pertickler, I mean?\" The commonplace question, Simpson realized, veiled  a dreadfully serious thought in his mind. A shiver ran down his back.    \"Nothing but burning wood,\" he replied firmly, kicking again at the  embers. The sound of his own foot made him start.    \"And all the evenin' you ain't smelt--nothing?\" persisted the guide,  peering at him through the gloom; \"nothing extrordiny, and different to  anything else you ever smelt before?\"    \"No, no, man; nothing at all!\" he replied aggressively, half angrily.    Defago's face cleared. \"That's good!\" he exclaimed with evident relief.  \"That's good to hear.\"    \"Have _you?_\" asked Simpson sharply, and the same instant regretted the  question.    The Canadian came closer in the darkness. He shook his head. \"I guess  not,\" he said, though without overwhelming conviction. \"It must've been  just that song of mine that did it. It's the song they sing in lumber  camps and godforsaken places like that, when they're skeered the  Wendigo's somewhere around, doin' a bit of swift traveling.--\"    \"And what's the Wendigo, pray?\" Simpson asked quickly, irritated because  again he could not prevent that sudden shiver of the nerves. He knew  that he was close upon the man's terror and the cause of it. Yet a  rushing passionate curiosity overcame his better judgment, and his fear.    Defago turned swiftly and looked at him as though he were suddenly about  to shriek. His eyes shone, but his mouth was wide open. Yet all he said,  or whispered rather, for his voice sank very low, was: \"It's  nuthin'--nuthin' but what those lousy fellers believe when they've bin  hittin' the bottle too long--a sort of great animal that lives up  yonder,\" he jerked his head northwards, \"quick as lightning in its  tracks, an' bigger'n anything else in the Bush, an' ain't supposed to be  very good to look at--that's all!\"    \"A backwoods superstition--\" began Simpson, moving hastily toward the  tent in order to shake off the hand of the guide that clutched his arm.  \"Come, come, hurry up for God's sake, and get the lantern going! It's  time we were in bed and asleep if we're going to be up with the sun  tomorrow....\"    The guide was close on his heels. \"I'm coming,\" he answered out of the  darkness, \"I'm coming.\" And after a slight delay he appeared with the  lantern and hung it from a nail in the front pole of the tent. The  shadows of a hundred trees shifted their places quickly as he did so,  and when he stumbled over the rope, diving swiftly inside, the whole  tent trembled as though a gust of wind struck it.    The two men lay down, without undressing, upon their beds of soft balsam  boughs, cunningly arranged. Inside, all was warm and cozy, but outside  the world of crowding trees pressed close about them, marshalling their  million shadows, and smothering the little tent that stood there like a  wee white shell facing the ocean of tremendous forest.    Between the two lonely figures within, however, there pressed another  shadow that was _not_ a shadow from the night. It was the Shadow cast by  the strange Fear, never wholly exorcised, that had leaped suddenly upon  Defago in the middle of his singing. And Simpson, as he lay there,  watching the darkness through the open flap of the tent, ready to plunge  into the fragrant abyss of sleep, knew first that unique and profound  stillness of a primeval forest when no wind stirs ... and when the night  has weight and substance that enters into the soul to bind a veil about  it.... Then sleep took him....          III      Thus, it seemed to him, at least. Yet it was true that the lap of the  water, just beyond the tent door, still beat time with his lessening  pulses when he realized that he was lying with his eyes open and that  another sound had recently introduced itself with cunning softness  between the splash and murmur of the little waves.    And, long before he understood what this sound was, it had stirred in  him the"]]]
