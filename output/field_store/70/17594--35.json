[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10589"],[0,"Turkish Prisoners in Egypt (#4)"],[1,"to Make Complaints._--The camp commandant makes a general  inspection every day. Every prisoner has the right to step forward and  make his complaints. The commandant converses with the prisoners through  the medium of several British officers who speak Arabic and Turkish.  Moreover, the prisoners have the right of appeal to the  Commander-in-Chief and to Brig.-General Casson, who often make tours of  inspection through the camps.      _Religion._--The prisoners have every opportunity for practising their  religious observances. For the Mahometans a small mosque has been built,  round which they spread their praying carpets. Some of them read the  Koran regularly; others seem indifferent. Despite differences of race,  origin, and even of religion, good-feeling prevails among the prisoners  and quarrels are very few in number.      _Games and Recreations._--As regards games and recreations, the  prisoners are interested only in wrestling, cards and dominoes. They  have been introduced to football without success. Some have shown great  skill in the manufacture of mandolines, guitars, and tambourines. All  materials as well as games are provided gratis by the British  Government. The camp commandant has bought the men some gramophones.  Many prisoners make articles of coloured beads--handbags, purses,  necklaces, bracelets, etc.--which show considerable artistic taste. We  bought one of these beautiful pieces of work as a specimen. The articles  sell readily in the curiosity shops at Cairo. One section of 1,200  prisoners netted from the sales a sum of 2,500 francs in a fortnight.      _Correspondence._--Most of the prisoners receive very few letters or  none. They are allowed to write in their language once a fortnight, but  take very little advantage of the permission. It seems that many letters  addressed to their families in Turkey come back again, as the addressee  has not been found. Some Turks captured near Bagdad and transported to  Burmah received their money from home, but have not received any more  during the one or two months that have elapsed since they were  transferred to Maadi. It is probable that the money was sent home again,  or forwarded officially to the new place of internment, and this takes a  long time. Several prisoners have taken advantage of their captivity to  learn reading and writing with their comrades' assistance. Many men had  money on them when they were taken. This money is lodged, and handed to  them at demand in monthly payments. Many soldiers have received money  orders from their families through the International Committee of the  Red Cross. Parcels, which are seldom received, are opened in the  presence of the addressee. Only knives are confiscated.      _Help for Prisoners._--Leaving out of consideration the wish expressed  by some men to have a little money for buying extra tobacco and coffee,  we are satisfied that there are no needy persons in the camp at Maadi.      _Mentality._--The many questions which we have asked show that there is  no dissatisfaction among the prisoners with regard to the treatment they  receive. Prisoners have mentioned to us chiefly their anxiety about  their families, of whom they have no news. The Armenian clergy at Cairo  look after their fellow-countrymen.          ~4. The Egyptian Red Cross Hospital at Cairo~.    _(Visited on January 4, 1917.)_      The Egyptian Red Cross, under the presidency of His Highness Prince Fuad  Pasha, being anxious to help its co-religionists, founded in March,  1915, a hospital for sick and wounded prisoners of war. This hospital is  under the sole management of the Turkish Red Cross, which is in touch  with the British authorities through Dr. Keatinge, Professor of the  Faculty of Medicine at Cairo.      _Sanitary Staff._--All the hospital doctors are Egyptian. In addition to  the doctor-in-chief, Dr. Abbas Bey Helmey, two doctors, three surgeons,  and one druggist live in the hospital.    Consulting doctors come from the town when sent for to treat nose, ear  and eye troubles. A Cairo specialist also places his X-ray apparatus at  the service of the hospital patients. The matron is an American, and has  three English nurses under her.    Thirty-two orderlies do the ward work.      _Accommodation._--The Egyptian Red Cross Hospital is installed in an old  palace of Omar-Pasha Lufti, situated in a large garden, which is very  shady and well kept. The dimensions of the wards assure easy circulation  of air and perfect ventilation. As the building was not designed to  serve its present purpose, the various staffs are somewhat scattered,  but this difficulty has been got over in a most practical manner. A huge  corridor gives communication between the wards, which are usually 23  feet square and 26 feet high. The large wards considerably exceed these  measurements, and their tasteful decoration gives them a characteristic  style. On the first floor, the rooms for the consumptive patients  measure 16 by 16 by 13 feet--a very good cubical allowance for the four  beds in each. The floor is of large flag-stones. Most of the rooms  command the garden and a courtyard planted with trees. The building  occupied by the guard is quite separate from the hospital. Electricity  is used throughout the buildings.      _Bedding._--The iron bedsteads, painted with white ripolin, are  separated from one another by pedestal tables. The spring mattress,  stuffed mattress, sheets and pillows are in very sound condition. There  is no limit set to the number of blankets allowed. The beds are covered  with pretty blue and white quilts, with the Red Cross in the middle.  This quite recent innovation has a very pretty effect.      _Food._--The commissariat is arranged by contract with a head cook. The  menus are drawn up by the doctors according to the diet prescribed. We  tasted the day's food and found it excellent. All provisions examined by  us were of good quality and carefully overlooked. The kitchen, with its  well-fitted ranges and polished utensils, struck us favourably. The  cooking and attendance is done by persons engaged by the chef.    Each man is provided with two bowls of tinned copper and a drinking cup.  All invalids get sweetened tea twice a day. Officers may choose tea or  coffee. The following is the hospital dietary:    FOR OFFICERS.    _Breakfast_: European bread; fresh milk; 3 eggs; tea; coffee.    _Lunch_: Mutton; two dishes of vegetables, or macaroni rice;    salad; rice pudding; coffee; fruit.    _Dinner_: The same as lunch, but without fruit.    ORDINARY DIET.    _Breakfast_: Arab bread; sweetened fresh milk.    _Lunch_: Arab bread; beef; rice, vegetables.    _Dinner_: Arab bread; rice soup; rice pudding.    MILK DIET.    _Breakfast_: Bread, 350 grm.; sweetened milk.    _Lunch_: Arab bread; soup; beef-tea; rice pudding.    _Dinner_: Bread, 350 grm.; sweetened milk.    FEVER DIET.    _Breakfast_: Milk, 400 grm., without sugar.    _Lunch_: 400 grm. of milk without sugar.    _Dinner_: 400 grm. of milk without sugar.    On Sunday and Thursday mutton is replaced by game. On the same two days  a course of sweetened rice and macaroni is substituted for fruit. The  ration of Arab bread is 780 grammes for ordinary diet; that of European  bread 450 grammes. The proportion of other articles is equally liberal.      _Clothing._--The sick men's garments are consigned to a storehouse, and  are replaced by 2 nightshirts, a hospital jacket with a hood, and a pair  of slippers.      _Hygiene._--Drinking water is drawn from the town main and filtered  before use. There is an ample installation of lavatories with running  water, baths with hot and cold douches, and Turkish baths. Turkish  latrines have been fitted in the annexes of the palace. Natives do the  laundry work and ironing.      _Special Quarters._--The Red Cross Hospital is provided with a spacious,  well-lighted theatre for operations, and all the necessary apparatus. In  a neighbouring ward a powerful fumigating stove, built by natives after  a French model, enables instruments and dressings to be completely  sterilised. Since the introduction of this perfected method of  sterilisation cases of infection and erysipelas have entirely  disappeared from the hospital, and post-operation mortality has been  reduced to barely one quarter per cent.    There is a laboratory devoted to summary analyses; more complete  chemical or bacteriological analyses are carried out in the town  institution. The dispensary is well supplied, containing all the most  modern medicaments.    Six wards are reserved for tuberculous cases, who have their own special  nurses. Such consumptives as are not confined to bed pass most of the  day in one of the palace gardens which is assigned to them.    One ward is occupied by wounded officers; another by the  non-commissioned officers. Two more wards are set apart for patients  suffering from dysentery. Operation cases are assembled in a special  chamber adjoining the theatre. Three comfortable English hospital tents  erected in the garden serve as accommodation for convalescents who have  to vacate their beds in the palace when an unexpected influx of sick or  wounded prisoners takes place. All the wards are clean and well kept; at  the head of each bed is a medical chart detailing the illness and the  temperature.      _Sickness._--Since March 17, 1915, the date of its foundation, up to the  day of our visit, the Egyptian Red Cross Hospital has treated 2,245  wounded or sick prisoners.    There are at the present time 149 prisoners under treatment, 8 Ottoman  officers and 141 soldiers, distributed as follows:    Surgical cases (wounds): 66; among them 13 invalids and 6 who have  undergone amputation and have been detained a long time in the hospital.    Internal ailments: 38; we may mention among the most serious cases of  this kind noticed by us, 4 suffering from bilious haemoglobinurea, all  from Bagdad; 6 from dysentery, anaemic and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10598"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume I.

Those who would prefer the thoughts of this father of English poetry,  in a modern dress, are referred to the elegant versions of him,  by Dryden, Pope, and others, who have done ample justice to their  illustrious predecessor.      [Footnote 1: Life of Chaucer prefixed to Ogle's edition of that author  modernized.]    [Footnote 2: Some biographers of Chaucer say, that pope Gregory IX.  gave orders to the archbishop of Canterbury to summon him, and that  when a synod was convened at St. Paul's, a quarrel happened between  the bishop of London and the duke of Lancaster, concerning Wickliff's  sitting down in their presence.]    [Footnote 3: Mr. Camden gives a particular description of this  castle.]           *       *       *       *       *      LANGLAND.    It has been disputed amongst the critics whether this poet preceded  or followed Chaucer. Mrs. Cooper, author of the Muses Library, is of  opinion that he preceded Chaucer, and observes that in more places  than one that great poet seems to copy Langland; but I am rather  inclined to believe that he was cotemporary with him, which accounts  for her observation, and my conjecture is strengthened by the  consideration of his stile, which is equally unmusical and obsolete  with Chaucer's; and tho' Dryden has told us that Chaucer exceeded  those who followed him at 50 or 60 years distance, in point of  smoothness, yet with great submission to his judgment, I think there  is some alteration even in Skelton and Harding, which will appear to  the reader to the best advantage by a quotation. Of Langland's family  we have no account. Selden in his notes on Draiton's Poly Olbion,  quotes him with honour; but he is entirely neglected by Philips and  Winstanly, tho' he seems to have been a man of great genius: Besides  Chaucer, few poets in that or the subsequent age had more real  inspiration or poetical enthusiasm in their compositions. One cannot  read the works of this author, or Chaucer, without lamenting the  unhappiness of a fluctuating language, that buries in its ruins even  genius itself; for like edifices of sand, every breath of time defaces  it, and if the form remain, the beauty is lost. The piece from which I  shall quote a few lines, is a work of great length and labour, of  the allegoric kind; it is animated with a lively and luxurious  imagination; pointed with a variety of pungent satire; and dignified  with many excellent lessons of morality; but as to the conduct of  the whole, it does not appear to be of a piece; every vision seems a  distinct rhapsody, and does not carry on either one single action or  a series of many; but we ought rather to wonder at its beauties than  cavil at its defects; and if the poetical design is broken, the  moral is entire, which, is uniformly the advancement of piety, and  reformation of the Roman clergy. The piece before us is entitled the  Vision of Piers the Plowman, and I shall quote that particular part  which seems to have furnished a hint to Milton in his Paradise Lost,  b. 2. 1. 475.      Kinde Conscience tho' heard, and came out of    the planets,    And sent forth his sorrioues, fevers, and fluxes,    Coughes, and cardicales, crampes and toothaches,    Reums, and ragondes, and raynous scalles,    Byles, and blothes, and burning agues,    Freneses, and foul euyl, foragers of kinde!           *       *       *       *       *    There was harrow! and help! here cometh Kinde    With death that's dreadful, to undone us all    Age the hoore, he was in vaw-ward    And bare the baner before death, by right he it    claymed!    Kinde came after, with many kene foxes,    As pockes, and pestilences, and much purple    shent;    So Kinde, through corruptions killed full many:    Death came driving after, and all to dust pashed    Kyngs and bagaars, knights and popes.           *       *       *       *       *  MILTON.      ----------Immediately a place    Before his eyes appear'd, sad, noisom, dark,    A lazar-house it seem'd; wherein were laid      Numbers of all diseased: all maladies    Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms    Of heartsick agony, all fev'rous kinds,    Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,    Intestine stone and ulcer, cholic-pangs    Demoniac phrenzy, moping melancholy    And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,    Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,    Dropsies and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums;    Dire was the tossing! deep the groans! despair    Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch:    And over them, triumphant death his dart    Shook.  P. L. b. xi. 1. 477.           *       *       *       *       *      Sir JOHN GOWER    Flourished in the reign of Edward III, and Richard II. He was  cotemporary with Chaucer and much esteemed and honoured by him, as  appears by his submitting his Troilus and Cressida to his censure.  Stow in his Survey of London seems to be of opinion that he was no  knight, but only an esquire; however, it is certain he was descended  of a knightly family, at Sittenham in Yorkshire. He received his  education in London, and studied the law, but being possessed of a  great fortune, he dedicated himself more to pleasure and poetry than  the bar; tho' he seems not to have made any proficiency in poetry, for  his works are rather cool translations, than originals, and are quite  destitute of poetical fire. Bale makes him Equitem Auratum & Poetam  Laureatum, but Winstanly says that he was neither laureated nor  bederated, but only rosated, having a chaplet of four roses about his  head in his monumental stone erected in St. Mary Overy's, Southwark:  He was held in great esteem by King Richard II, to whom he dedicates a  book called Confessio Amantis. That he was a man of no honour appears  by his behaviour when the revolution under Henry IV happened in  England. He was under the highest obligations to Richard II; he had  been preferred, patronized and honoured by him, yet no sooner did that  unhappy prince (who owed his misfortunes in a great measure to his  generosity and easiness of nature) fall a sacrifice to the policy of  Henry and the rage of rebellion, but he worshiped the Rising Sun,  he joined his interest with the new king, and tho' he was then  stone-blind, and, as might naturally be imagined, too old to desire  either riches or power, yet he was capable of the grossest flattery  to the reigning prince, and like an ungrateful monster insulted the  memory of his murdered sovereign and generous patron. He survived  Chaucer two years; Winstanly says, that in his old age he was made a  judge, possibly in consequence of his adulation to Henry IV. His death  happened in the year 1402, and as he is said to have been born some  years before Chaucer, so he must have been near fourscore years of  age: He was buried in St. Mary Overy's in Southwark, in the chapel of  St. John, where he founded a chauntry, and left money for a mass to be  daily sung for him, as also an obit within the church to be kept on  Friday after the feast of St. Gregory. He lies under a tomb of stone,  with his image also of stone over him, the hair of his head auburn,  long to his shoulders, but curling up, and a small forked beard;  on his head a chaplet like a coronet of roses; an habit of purple,  damasked down to his feet, and a collar of gold about his neck. Under  his feet the likeness of three books which he compiled; the first  named Speculum Meditantis, written in French; the second Vox  Clamantis, in latin; the third Confessio Amantis, in English; this  last piece was printed by one Thomas Berthalette, and by him dedicated  to King Henry VIII. His Vox clamantis, with his Chronica Tripartita,  and other works, both in Latin and French, Stow says he had in his  possession, but his Speculum Meditantis he never saw. Besides on the  wall where he lies, there were painted three virgins crowned, one of  which was named Charity, holding this device,      En toy quies fitz de Dieu le pere,    Sauve soit, qui gist fours cest pierre.
