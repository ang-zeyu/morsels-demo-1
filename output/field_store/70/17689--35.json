Not in the lyre of Orpheus,  Not in the songs of Musaeus,  Lurked the unfathomed bewitchment  Wrought by the wind in the grasses,                                      10  Held by the rote of the sea-surf,    In early summer.    Only to exquisite lovers,  Fashioned for beauty's fulfilment,  Mated as rhythm to reed-stop                                             15  Whence the wild music is moulded,  Ever appears the full measure    Of the world's wonder.          XXXIV      \"Who was Atthis?\" men shall ask,  When the world is old, and time  Has accomplished without haste  The strange destiny of men.    Haply in that far-off age                                                 5  One shall find these silver songs,  With their human freight, and guess  What a lover Sappho was.          XXXV      When the great pink mallow  Blossoms in the marshland,  Full of lazy summer  And soft hours,    Then I hear the summons                                                   5  Not a mortal lover  Ever yet resisted,  Strange and far.    In the faint blue foothills,  Making magic music,                                                      10  Pan is at his love-work  On the reeds.    I can guess the heart-stop,  Fall and lull and sequence,  Full of grief for Syrinx                                                 15  Long ago.    Then the crowding madness,  Wild and keen and tender,  Trembles with the burden  Of great joy.                                                            20    Nay, but well I follow,  All unskilled, that fluting.  Never yet was reed-nymph  Like to thee.          XXXVI      When I pass thy door at night  I a benediction breathe:  \"Ye who have the sleeping world    In your care,    \"Guard the linen sweet and cool,                                          5  Where a lovely golden head  With its dreams of mortal bliss    Slumbers now!\"          XXXVII      Well I found you in the twilit garden,  Laid a lover's hand upon your shoulder,  And we both were made aware of loving  Past the reach of reason to unravel,  Or the much desiring heart to follow.                                     5    There we heard the breath among the grasses  And the gurgle of soft-running water,  Well contented with the spacious starlight,  The cool wind's touch and the deep blue distance,  Till the dawn came in with golden sandals.                               10          XXXVIII      Will not men remember us  In the days to come hereafter,--  Thy warm-coloured loving beauty    And my love for thee?    Thou, the hyacinth that grows                                             5  By a quiet-running river;  I, the watery reflection    And the broken gleam.        XXXIX      I grow weary of the foreign cities,  The sea travel and the stranger peoples.  Even the clear voice of hardy fortune  Dares me not as once on brave adventure.    For the heart of man must seek and wander,                                5  Ask and question and discover knowledge;  Yet above all goodly things is wisdom,  And love greater than all understanding.    So, a mariner, I long for land-fall,--  When a darker purple on the sea-rim,                                     10  O'er the prow uplifted, shall be Lesbos  And the gleaming towers of Mitylene.          XL      Ah, what detains thee, Phaon,  So long from Mitylene,  Where now thy restless lover  Wearies for thy coming?    A fever burns me, Phaon;                                                  5  My knees quake on the threshold,  And all my strength is loosened,  Slack with disappointment.    But thou wilt come, my Phaon,  Back from the sea like morning,                                          10  To quench in golden gladness  The ache of parted lovers.          XLI      Phaon, O my lover,  What should so detain thee,    Now the wind comes walking  Through the leafy twilight?    All the plum-leaves quiver                                                5  With the coolth and darkness,    After their long patience  In consuming ardour.    And the moving grasses  Have relief; the dew-drench                                              10    Comes to quell the parching  Ache of noon they suffered.    I alone of all things  Fret with unsluiced fire.    And there is no quenching                                                15  In the night for Sappho,    Since her lover Phaon  Leaves her unrequited.          XLII      O heart of insatiable longing,  What spell, what enchantment allures thee  Over the rim of the world  With the sails of the sea-going ships?    And when the rose-petals are scattered                                    5  At dead of still noon on the grass-plot,  What means this passionate grief,--  This infinite ache of regret?          XLIII      Surely somehow, in some measure,  There will be joy and fulfilment,--  Cease from this throb of desire,--    Even for Sappho!    Surely some fortunate hour                                                5  Phaon will come, and his beauty  Be spent like water to plenish    Need of that beauty!    Where is the breath of Poseidon,  Cool from the sea-floor with evening?                                    10  Why are Selene's white horses    So long arriving?          XLIV      O but my delicate lover,  Is she not fair as the moonlight?  Is she not supple and strong    For hurried passion?    Has not the god of the green world,                                       5  In his large tolerant wisdom,  Filled with the ardours of earth    Her twenty summers?    Well did he make her for loving;  Well did he mould her for beauty;                                        10  Gave her the wish that is brave    With understanding.    \"O Pan, avert from this maiden  Sorrow, misfortune, bereavement,  Harm, and unhappy regret,\"                                               15    Prays one fond mortal.          XLV      Softer than the hill-fog to the forest  Are the loving hands of my dear lover,  When she sleeps beside me in the starlight  And her beauty drenches me with rest.    As the quiet mist enfolds the beech-trees,                                5  Even as she dreams her arms enfold me,  Half awaking with a hundred kisses  On the scarlet lily of her mouth.          XLVI      I seek and desire,  Even as the wind  That travels the plain  And stirs in the bloom  Of the apple-tree.                                                        5    I wander through life,  With the searching mind  That is never at rest,  Till I reach the shade  Of my lover's door.                                                      10          XLVII      Like torn sea-kelp in the drift  Of the great tides of the sea,  Carried past the harbour-mouth  To the deep beyond return,    I am buoyed and borne away                                                5  On the loveliness of earth,  Little caring, save for thee,  Past the portals of the night.          XLVIII      Fine woven purple linen  I bring thee from Phocaea,  That, beauty upon beauty,  A precious gift may cover  The lap where I have lain.                                                5    And a gold comb, and girdle,  And trinkets of white silver,  And gems are in my sea-chest,  Lest poor and empty-handed  Thy lover should return.                                                 10    And I have brought from Tyre  A Pan-flute stained vermilion,  Wherein the gods have hidden  Love and desire and longing,  Which I shall loose for thee.                                            15          XLIX      When I am home from travel,  My eager foot will stay not  Until I reach the threshold  Where I went forth from thee.    And there, as darkness gathers                                            5  In the rose-scented garden,  The god who prospers music  Shall give me skill to play.    And thou shalt hear, all startled,  A flute blown in the twilight,                                           10  With the soft pleading magic  The green wood heard of old.    Then, lamp in hand, thy beauty  In the rose-marble entry!  And unreluctant Hermes                                                   15  Shall give me words to say.          L      When I behold the pharos shine  And lay a path along the sea,  How gladly I shall feel the spray,  Standing upon the swinging prow;    And question of my pilot old,                                             5  How many watery leagues to sail  Ere we shall round the harbour reef  And anchor off the wharves of home!          LI      Is the day long,  O Lesbian maiden,  And the night endless  In thy lone chamber  In Mitylene?                                                              5    All the bright day,  Until welcome evening  When the stars kindle  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#4)"],[1," was purty handy, Wentz. I couldn't hev' did better myself, and I  was comin' for that purpose,\" said the frontiersman. \"Leffler was  tryin' to kiss the lass. He's been drunk fer two days. That little  girl's sweetheart kin handle himself some, now you take my word on  it.\"    \"I'll agree Leff's bad when he's drinkin',\" answered the fur-trader,  and to Joe he added, \"He's liable to look you up when he comes  around.\"    \"Tell him if I am here when he gets sober, I'll kill him,\" Joe cried  in a sharp voice. His gaze rested once more on the fallen teamster,  and again an odd contraction of his eyes was noticeable. The glance  was cutting, as if with the flash of cold gray steel. \"Nell, I'm  sorry I wasn't round sooner,\" he said, apologetically, as if it was  owing to his neglect the affair had happened.    As they entered the cabin Nell stole a glance at him. This was the  third time he had injured a man because of her. She had on several  occasions seen that cold, steely glare in his eyes, and it had  always frightened her. It was gone, however, before they were inside  the building. He said something which she did not hear distinctly,  and his calm voice allayed her excitement. She had been angry with  him; but now she realized that her resentment had disappeared. He  had spoken so kindly after the outburst. Had he not shown that he  considered himself her protector and lover? A strange emotion, sweet  and subtle as the taste of wine, thrilled her, while a sense of fear  because of his strength was mingled with her pride in it. Any other  girl would have been only too glad to have such a champion; she  would, too, hereafter, for he was a man of whom to be proud.    \"Look here, Nell, you haven't spoken to me,\" Joe cried suddenly,  seeming to understand that she had not even heard what he said, so  engrossed had she been with her reflections. \"Are you mad with me  yet?\" he continued. \"Why, Nell, I'm in--I love you!\"    Evidently Joe thought such fact a sufficient reason for any act on  his part. His tender tone conquered Nell, and she turned to him with  flushed cheeks and glad eyes.    \"I wasn't angry at all,\" she whispered, and then, eluding the arm he  extended, she ran into the other room.        Chapter III.    Joe lounged in the doorway of the cabin, thoughtfully contemplating  two quiet figures that were lying in the shade of a maple tree. One  he recognized as the Indian with whom Jim had spent an earnest hour  that morning; the red son of the woods was wrapped in slumber. He  had placed under his head a many-hued homespun shirt which the young  preacher had given him; but while asleep his head had rolled off  this improvised pillow, and the bright garment lay free, attracting  the eye. Certainly it had led to the train of thought which had  found lodgment in Joe's fertile brain.    The other sleeper was a short, stout man whom Joe had seen several  times before. This last fellow did not appear to be well-balanced in  his mind, and was the butt of the settlers' jokes, while the  children called him \"Loorey.\" He, like the Indian, was sleeping off  the effects of the previous night's dissipation.    During a few moments Joe regarded the recumbent figures with an  expression on his face which told that he thought in them were great  possibilities for sport. With one quick glance around he disappeared  within the cabin, and when he showed himself at the door, surveying  the village square with mirthful eyes, he held in his hand a small  basket of Indian design. It was made of twisted grass, and simply  contained several bits of soft, chalky stone such as the Indians  used for painting, which collection Joe had discovered among the  fur-trader's wares.    He glanced around once more, and saw that all those in sight were  busy with their work. He gave the short man a push, and chuckled  when there was no response other than a lazy grunt. Joe took the  Indians' gaudy shirt, and, lifting Loorey, slipped it around him,  shoved the latter's arms through the sleeves, and buttoned it in  front. He streaked the round face with red and white paint, and  then, dexterously extracting the eagle plume from the Indian's  head-dress, stuck it in Loorey's thick shock of hair. It was all  done in a moment, after which Joe replaced the basket, and went down  to the river.    Several times that morning he had visited the rude wharf where Jeff  Lynn, the grizzled old frontiersman, busied himself with  preparations for the raft-journey down the Ohio. Lynn had been  employed to guide the missionary's party to Fort Henry, and, as the  brothers had acquainted him with their intention of accompanying the  travelers, he had constructed a raft for them and their horses.    Joe laughed when he saw the dozen two-foot logs fastened together,  upon which a rude shack had been erected for shelter. This slight  protection from sun and storm was all the brothers would have on  their long journey.    Joe noted, however, that the larger raft had been prepared with some  thought for the comfort of the girls. The floor of the little hut  was raised so that the waves which broke over the logs could not  reach it. Taking a peep into the structure, Joe was pleased to see  that Nell and Kate would be comfortable, even during a storm. A  buffalo robe and two red blankets gave to the interior a cozy, warm  look. He observed that some of the girls' luggage was already on  board.    \"When'll we be off?\" he inquired.    \"Sun-up,\" answered Lynn, briefly.    \"I'm glad of that. I like to be on the go in the early morning,\"  said Joe, cheerfully.    \"Most folks from over Eastways ain't in a hurry to tackle the  river,\" replied Lynn, eyeing Joe sharply.    \"It's a beautiful river, and I'd like to sail on it from here to  where it ends, and then come back to go again,\" Joe replied, warmly.    \"In a hurry to be a-goin'? I'll allow you'll see some slim red  devils, with feathers in their hair, slipping among the trees along  the bank, and mebbe you'll hear the ping which's made when whistlin'  lead hits. Perhaps you'll want to be back here by termorrer  sundown.\"    \"Not I,\" said Joe, with his short, cool laugh.    The old frontiersman slowly finished his task of coiling up a rope  of wet cowhide, and then, producing a dirty pipe, he took a live  ember from the fire and placed it on the bowl. He sucked slowly at  the pipe-stem, and soon puffed out a great cloud of smoke. Sitting  on a log, he deliberately surveyed the robust shoulders and long,  heavy limbs of the young man, with a keen appreciation of their  symmetry and strength. Agility, endurance and courage were more to a  borderman than all else; a new-comer on the frontier was always  \"sized-up\" with reference to these \"points,\" and respected in  proportion to the measure in which he possessed them.    Old Jeff Lynn, riverman, hunter, frontiersman, puffed slowly at his  pipe while he mused thus to himself: \"Mebbe I'm wrong in takin' a  likin' to this youngster so sudden. Mebbe it's because I'm fond of  his sunny-haired lass, an' ag'in mebbe it's because I'm gettin' old  an' likes young folks better'n I onct did. Anyway, I'm kinder  thinkin, if this young feller gits worked out, say fer about twenty  pounds less, he'll lick a whole raft-load of wild-cats.\"    Joe walked to and fro on the logs, ascertained how the raft was put  together, and took a pull on the long, clumsy steering-oar. At  length he seated himself beside Lynn. He was eager to ask questions;  to know about the rafts, the river, the forest, the  Indians--everything in connection with this wild life; but already  he had learned that questioning these frontiersmen is a sure means  of closing their lips.    \"Ever handle the long rifle?\" asked Lynn, after a silence.    \"Yes,\" answered Joe, simply.    \"Ever shoot anythin'?\" the frontiersman questioned, when he had  taken four or five puffs at his pipe.    \"Squirrels.\"    \"Good practice, shootin' squirrels,\" observed Jeff, after another  silence, long enough to allow Joe to talk if he was so inclined.  \"Kin ye hit one--say, a hundred yards?\"    \"Yes, but not every time in the head,\" returned Joe. There was an  apologetic tone in his answer.    Another interval followed in which neither spoke. Jeff was slowly  pursuing his line of thought. After Joe's last remark he returned  his pipe to his pocket and brought out a tobacco-pouch. He tore off  a large portion of the weed and thrust it into his mouth. Then he  held out the little buckskin sack to Joe.    \"Hev' a chaw,\" he said.    To offer tobacco to anyone was absolutely a borderman's guarantee of  friendliness toward that person.    Jeff expectorated half a dozen times, each time coming a little  nearer the stone he was aiming at, some five yards distant. Possibly  this was the borderman's way of oiling up his conversational  machinery. At all events, he commenced to talk.    \"Yer brother's goin' to preach out here, ain't he? Preachin' is all  right, I'll allow; but I'm kinder doubtful about preachin' to  redskins. Howsumever, I've knowed Injuns who are good fellows, and  there's no tellin'. What are ye goin' in fer--farmin'?\"    \"No, I wouldn't make a good farmer.\"    \"Jest cum out kinder wild like, eh?\" rejoined Jeff, knowingly.    \"I wanted to come West because I was tired of tame life. I love the  forest; I want to fish and hunt; and I think I'd like to--to see  Indians.\"    \"I kinder thought so,\" said the old frontiersman, nodding his head  as though he perfectly understood Joe's case. \"Well, lad, where  you're goin' seein' Injuns ain't a matter of choice. You has to see  'em, and fight 'em, too. We've had bad times for years out here on  the border, and I'm thinkin' wuss is comin'. Did ye ever hear the  name Girty?\"    \"Yes; he's a renegade.\"    \"He's a traitor, and Jim and George Girty, his brothers, are p'isin  rattlesnake Injuns. Simon Girty's bad enough; but Jim's the wust.  He's now wusser'n a full-blooded Delaware. He's all the time"]]]
