I really thought that by entirely complying  with her wishes, it might have been an incitement to her to improve, and to  acknowledge my complete unselfishness.    Perhaps I may see you to-morrow. Frau S. can order the shoes and stockings  and all that Carl requires, and I will remit her the money at once. I beg  that you will always order and buy anything Carl ought to have, without any  reference to me, merely informing me of the amount, which I will forthwith  discharge, without waiting for the end of the quarter. I will take care  that Carl has a new coat for the next examination.    One thing more. The mother affects to receive her information from a person  in your house. If you cannot arrange with Czerny to bring Carl home, he  must not go at all; \"_trau, schau, wem!_\" [trust not till you try.] The  only impression that his mother ought to make on Carl is what I have  already told him,--namely, to respect her as _his mother_, but _not to  follow her example in any respect_; he must be strongly warned against  this.    Yours truly,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      241.    TO ZMESKALL.    Sept. 11, 1817.    DEAR Z.,--    The answer from London arrived yesterday [see No. 236], but in English. Do  you know any one who could translate it verbally for us? In haste,    Your    BEETHOVEN.      242.    TO ZMESKALL.    Oct. 20, 1817.    DEAR Z.,--    The devil himself cannot persuade your _Famulus_ to take away the wine.  Pray forgive my behavior yesterday; I intended to have asked your pardon  this very afternoon. _In my present condition_ I require _indulgence_ from  every one, for I am a poor unfortunate creature!    In haste, as ever, yours.      243.    TO ZMESKALL.    DEAR Z.,--    I give up the journey; at least I will not pledge myself on this point. The  matter must be more maturely considered. In the mean time the work is  already sent off to the Prince Regent. _If they want me they can have me_,  and I am still at _liberty_ to say _yes_! or _no_! Liberty!!!! what more  can any one desire!!!      244.    TO ZMESKALL.    DEAR Z.,--    Don't be angry about my note. Are you not aware of my present condition,  which is like that of Hercules with Queen Omphale??? I asked you to buy me  a looking-glass like yours, which I now return, but if you do not require  it, I wish you would send yours back to me to-day, for mine is broken.  Farewell, and do not write in such high-flown terms about me, for never  have I felt so strongly as now the strength and the weakness of human  nature.    Continue your regard for me.      245.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    The Autumn of 1817.    I have had an interview with your husband, whose sympathy did me both good  and harm, for Streicher almost upset my resignation. God alone knows the  result! but as I have always assisted my fellow-men when I had the power to  do so, I also rely on his mercy to me.    Educate your daughter carefully, that she may make a good wife.    To-day happens to be Sunday; so I will quote you something out of the  Bible,--\"Love one another.\" I conclude with best regards to your best of  daughters, and with the wish that all your wounds may be healed.    When you visit the ancient ruins [Frau Streicher was in Baden], do not  forget that Beethoven has often lingered there; when you stray through the  silent pine forests, do not forget that Beethoven often wrote poetry there,  or, as it is termed, _composed_.      246.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    How deeply am I indebted to you, my excellent friend, and I have become  such a poor creature that I have no means of repaying you. I am very  grateful to Streicher for all the trouble he has taken on my behalf [about  a house in the Gaertner Strasse], and beg he will continue his inquiries.  God will, I hope, one day enable me to return benefit for benefit, but this  being at present impossible, grieves me most of all....    Now Heaven be praised! [he thus winds up a long letter about a bad  servant,] I have contrived to collect all these particulars for you with no  little toil and trouble, and God grant that I may never, never more be  obliged to speak, or write, or think again on such a subject, for mud and  mire are not more pernicious to artistic soil, than such devilry to any  man!!!      247.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    As to Frau von Stein [stone], I beg she will not allow Herr von Steiner to  turn into stone, that he may still be of service to me; nor must Frau von  Stein become too stony towards Herr von Steiner, &c.    My good Frau von Streicher, do not play any trick [Streiche] to your worthy  little husband, but rather be to all others Frau von Stein [stone]!!!!    Where are the coverlets for the beds?    [Music: Treble clef.  Where? where?]      248.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    ... It is now very evident from all this that if _you_ do not kindly  superintend things for me, I, with my _infirmities_, must meet with the  _same fate_ as usual at the hands of these people. Their _ingratitude_  towards you is what chiefly degrades both of them in my eyes. But I don't  understand your allusion about gossip? on one occasion alone can I remember  having forgotten myself for the moment, but _with very different people_.  This is all I can say on the subject. For my part I neither encourage nor  listen to the gossip of the lower orders. I have often given you hints on  the subject, without telling you a word of what I had heard. Away! away!  away! with such things!      249.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Nussdorf, Sept. 1, 1817.    I hope to be able to join you in Baden; but my invalid condition still  continues, and though in some respects improved, my malady is far from  being entirely cured. I have had, and still have, recourse to remedies of  every kind and shape; I must now give up the long-cherished hope of ever  being wholly restored. I hear that Y.R.H. looks wonderfully well, and  though many false inferences may be drawn from this as to good health,  still every one tells me that Y.R.H. is much better, and in this I feel  sincerely interested. I also trust that when Y.R.H. again comes to town, I  may assist you in those works dedicated to the Muses. My confidence is  placed on Providence, who will vouchsafe to hear my prayer, and one day set  me free from all my troubles, for I have served Him faithfully from my  childhood, and done good whenever it has been in my power; so my trust is  in Him alone, and I feel that the Almighty will not allow me to be utterly  crushed by all my manifold trials. I wish Y.R.H. all possible good and  prosperity, and shall wait on you the moment you return to town.    [K.]      250.    TO G. DEL RIO    Vienna, Nov. 12, 1817.    My altered circumstances render it possible that I may not be able to leave  Carl under your care beyond the end of this quarter; so, as in duty bound,  I give you this _warning_ a quarter in advance. Though it is painful to  admit it, my straitened circumstances leave me no choice in the matter; had  it been otherwise, how gladly would I have presented you with an additional  quarter's payment when I removed Carl, as a slight tribute of my gratitude.  I do hope you will believe that such are my _genuine and sincere_ wishes on  the subject. If on the other hand I leave Carl with you for the ensuing  quarter, commencing in February, I will apprise you of it early in January,  1818. I trust you will grant me this _favor_, and that I shall not solicit  it in vain. If I ever enjoy better health, so that I can _earn more money_,  I shall not fail to evince my gratitude, knowing well how much more you  have done for Carl than I had any right to expect; and I can with truth say  that to be obliged to confess my inability to requite your services at this  moment, distresses me much.    I am, with sincere esteem, your friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      251.    TO G. DEL RIO.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    I have been hitherto unable to answer your friendly letter, having been  much occupied and still far from well.    As to your proposal, it merits both gratitude and consideration. I must say  that the same idea formerly occurred to me about Carl; at this moment,  however, I am in the most unsettled state. This was why I made the  stipulation to which I begged you to agree, namely, to let you know in the  last month of the present quarter whether Carl was to continue with you. In  this way our plans would neither be hurried nor demolished. I am, besides,  well aware that it can be no advantage to you to have Carl either on his  present terms, or according to your last proposal, and on that very account  I wished to point out to you in my letter how gladly, besides the usual  remuneration, I would have testified my gratitude in some additional  manner.    When I spoke of my _inability_, I knew that his education would cost me  even more elsewhere than with you; but what I intended to convey was that  every father has a particular object in the education of his child, and it  is thus with me and Carl. No doubt we shall soon discover what is best for  him; whether to have a tutor here, or to go on as formerly. I do not wish  to tie myself down for the moment, but to remain free to act as his  interests may dictate.    Carl daily costs me great sacrifices, but I only allude to them on his own  account. I know too well the influence his mother contrives to acquire over  him, for she seems resolved to show herself well worthy of the name of  \"Queen of the Night.\" Besides, she everywhere spreads a report that I do  nothing whatever for Carl, whereas she pays everything!! As we have touched  on this point, I must thank you for your most considerate letter, which in  any event will be of great use to me. Pray ask Herr L.S. to be so kind as  to make my excuses to his brother for not having yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13291"],[0,"The World's Great Men of Music: Story-Lives of Master Musicians (#4)"],[1,"the memory of Bach is enduring, his fame immortal and the love his  beautiful music inspires increases from year to year, wherever that  music is known, all over the world.          III    GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL      While little Sebastian Bach was laboriously copying out music by pale  moonlight, because of his great love for it, another child of the same  age was finding the greatest happiness of his life seated before an  old spinet, standing in a lumber garret. He was trying to make music  from those half dumb keys. No one had taught him how to play; it was  innate genius that guided his little hands to find the right harmonies  and bring melody out of the old spinet.    The boy's name was George Frederick Handel, and he was born in the  German town of Halle, February 23, 1685. Almost from infancy he showed  a remarkable fondness for music. His toys must be able to produce  musical sounds or he did not care for them. The child did not inherit  a love for music from his father, for Dr. Handel, who was a surgeon,  looked on music with contempt, as something beneath the notice of a  gentleman. He had decided his son was to be a lawyer, and refused  to allow him to attend school for fear some one might teach him his  notes. The mother was a sweet gentle woman, a second wife, and much  younger than her husband, who seemed to have ruled his household with  a rod of iron.    When little George was about five, a kind friend, who knew how he  longed to make music, had a spinet sent to him unbeknown to his  father, and placed in a corner of the old garret. Here the child loved  to come when he could escape notice. Often at night, when all were  asleep, he would steal away to the garret and work at the spinet,  mastering difficulties one by one. The strings of the instrument had  been wound with cloth to deaden the sound, and thus made only a tiny  tinkle.    After this secret practising had been going on for some time, it was  discovered one night, when little George was enjoying his favorite  pastime. He had been missed and the whole house went in search.  Finally the father, holding high the lantern in his hand and followed  by mother and the rest of the inmates, reached the garret, and there  found the lost child seated at his beloved spinet, quite lost to  the material world. There is no record of any angry outburst on the  father's part and it is likely little George was left in peace.    One day when the boy was seven years old, the father was about to  start for the castle of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, to see his son,  a stepbrother of George, who was a _valet de chambre_ to the Duke.  Little George begged to go too, for he knew there was music to be  heard at the castle. In spite of his father's refusal he made up his  mind to go if he had to run every step of the way. So watching his  chance, he started to run after the coach in which his father rode.  The child had no idea it was a distance of forty miles. He strove  bravely to keep pace with the horses, but the roads were rough and  muddy. His strength beginning to fail, he called out to the coachman  to stop. His father, hearing the boy's voice looked out of the window.  Instead of scolding the little scamp roundly, he was touched by his  woebegone appearance, had him lifted into the coach and carried on to  Weissenfels.    George enjoyed himself hugely at the castle. The musicians were very  kind to him, and his delight could hardly be restrained when he was  allowed to try the beautiful organ in the chapel. The organist stood  behind him and arranged the stops, and the child put his fingers on  the keys that made the big pipes speak. During his stay, George had  several chances to play; one was on a Sunday at the close of the  service. The organist lifted him upon the bench and bade him play.  Instead of the Duke and all his people leaving the chapel, they stayed  to listen. When the music ceased the Duke asked: \"Who is that child?  Does anybody know his name?\" The organist was sent for, and then  little George was brought. The Duke patted him on the head, praised  his playing and said he was sure to become a good musician. The  organist then remarked he had heard the father disapproved of his  musical studies. The Duke was greatly astonished. He sent for the  father and after speaking highly of the boy's talent, said that  to place any obstacle in the child's way would be unworthy of the  father's honorable profession.    And so it was settled that George Frederick should devote himself to  music. Frederick Zachau, organist of the cathedral at Halle, was  the teacher chosen to instruct the boy on the organ, harpsichord and  violin. He also taught him composition, and showed him how different  countries and composers differed in their ideas of musical style. Very  soon the boy was composing the regular weekly service for the church,  besides playing the organ whenever Zachau happened to be absent. At  that time the boy could not have been more than eight years old.    After three years' hard work his teacher told him he must seek another  master, as he could teach him nothing more. So the boy was sent to  Berlin, to continue his studies. Two of the prominent musicians there  were Ariosti and Buononcini; the former received the boy kindly and  gave him great encouragement; the other took a dislike to the little  fellow, and tried to injure him. Pretending to test his musicianship,  Buononcini composed a very difficult piece for the harpsichord  and asked him to play it at sight. This the boy did with ease and  correctness. The Elector was delighted with the little musician,  offered him a place at Court and even promised to send him to Italy  to pursue his studies. Both offers were refused and George returned to  Halle and to his old master, who was happy to have him back once more.    Not long after this the boy's father passed away, and as there was but  little money left for the mother, her son decided at once that he must  support himself and not deprive her of her small income. He acted as  deputy organist at the Cathedral and Castle of Halle, and a few years  later, when the post was vacant, secured it at a salary of less  than forty dollars a year and free lodging. George Frederick was now  seventeen and longed for a broader field. Knowing that he must leave  Halle to find it, he said good-by to his mother, and in January 1703,  set out for Hamburg to seek his fortune.    The Opera House Orchestra needed a supplementary violin. It was a very  small post, but he took it, pretending not to be able to do anything  better. However a chance soon came his way to show what he was capable  of. One day the conductor, who always presided at the harpsichord, was  absent, and no one was there to take his place. Without delay George  came forward and took his vacant seat. He conducted so ably, that he  secured the position for himself.    The young musician led a busy life in Hamburg, filled with teaching,  study and composition. As his fame increased he secured more pupils,  and he was not only able to support himself, but could send some money  to his mother. He believed in saving money whenever he could; he knew  a man should not only be self supporting, but somewhat independent, in  order to produce works of art.    Handel now turned his attention to opera, composing \"Almira, Queen of  Castile,\" which was produced in Hamburg early in January 1705. This  success encouraged him to write others; indeed he was the author of  forty operas, which are only remembered now by an occasional aria.  During these several years of hard work he had looked forward to a  journey to Italy, for study. He was now a composer of some note and  decided it was high time to carry out his cherished desire.    He remained some time in Florence and composed the opera \"Rodrigo,\"  which was performed with great success. While in Venice he brought  out another opera, \"Agrippina,\" which had even greater success. Rome  delighted him especially and he returned for a second time in 1709.  Here he composed his first oratorio, the \"Resurrection,\" which was  produced there. Handel returned to Germany the following year. The  Elector of Hanover was kind to him, and offered him the post of  Capellmeister, with a salary of about fifteen hundred dollars. He  had long desired to visit England, and the Elector gave him leave of  absence. First, however, he went to Halle to see his mother and his  old teacher. We can imagine the joy of the meeting, and how proud and  happy both were at the success of the young musician. After a little  time spent with his dear ones, he set out for England.    Handel came to London, preceded by the fame of his Italian success.  Italian opera was the vogue just then in the English capital, but  it was so badly produced that a man of Handel's genius was needed to  properly set it before the people. He had not been long on English  soil when he produced his opera \"Rinaldo,\" at the Queen's Theater;  it had taken him just two weeks to compose the opera. It had great  success and ran night after night. There are many beautiful airs in  \"Rinaldo,\" some of which we hear to-day with the deepest pleasure.  \"Lascia ch'jo pianga\" and \"Cara si's sposa\" are two of them. The  Londoners had welcomed Handel with great cordiality and with his  new opera he was firmly established in their regard. With the young  musician likewise there seemed to be a sincere affection for England.  He returned in due time to his duties in Hanover, but he felt that  London was the field for his future activities.    It was not very long after his return to Germany that he sought  another leave of absence to visit England, promising to return within  a \"reasonable time.\" London received him with open arms and many great  people showered favors upon him. Lord Burlington invited him to his  residence in Piccadilly, which at that time consisted of green fields.  The only return to be made for all"]]]
