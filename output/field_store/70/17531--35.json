The idea of these  powerful agents, these supposed distributors of good and evil, was  always associated with that of terror; their name was never pronounced  without recalling to man's wind either his own particular calamities or  those of his fathers. In many places man trembles at this day, because  his progenitors have trembled for thousands of years past. The thought  of his gods always awakened in man the most afflicting ideas. If he  recurred to the source of his actual fears, to the commencement of those  melancholy impressions that stamp themselves in his mind when their  name is announced, he would find it in the conflagrations, in the  revolutions, in those extended disasters, that have at various times  destroyed large portions of the human race; that overwhelmed with dismay  those miserable beings who escaped the destruction of the earth; these  in transmitting to posterity, the tradition of such afflicting events,  have also transmitted to him their fears; have delivered down to their  successors, those gloomy ideas which their bewildered imaginations,  coupled with their barbarous ignorance of natural causes, had formed to  them of the anger of their irritated gods, to which their alarm falsely  attributed these sweeping disasters.    If the gods of nations had their birth in the bosom of alarm, it was  again in that of despair that each individual formed the unknown power  that he made exclusively for himself. Ignorant of physical causes,  unpractised in their mode of action, unaccustomed to their effects,  whenever he experienced any serious misfortune, whenever he was  afflicted with any grievous sensation, he was at a loss how to account  for it; he therefore attributed it to his household gods, to whom he  made an immediate supplication for assistance, or rather for forbearance  of further affliction: this disposition in man has been finely  pourtrayed by Aesop in his fable of \"the Waggoner and Hercules.\" The  motion which in despight of himself was excited in his machine, his  diseases, his troubles, his passions, his inquietude, the painful  alterations his frame underwent, without his being able to fathom the  true causes; at length death, of which the aspect in so formidable to a  being strongly attached to existence, were effects he looked upon either  as supernatural, or else he conceived they were repugnant to his actual  nature; he attributed them to some mighty cause, which maugre all his  efforts, disposed of him at each, moment. Thus palsied with alarm,  benumbed with terror, he pensively meditated upon his sorrows; agitated  with fear, he sought for means to avert the calamities that threatened  him with destruction; his imagination, thus rendered desperate by  his endurance of evils which he found inevitable, formed to him  those phantoms which he called gods; before whom he trembled from a  consciousness of his own weakness; thus disposed, he endeavoured by  prostration, by sacrifices, by prayers, to disarm the anger of these  imaginary beings to which his trepidation had given birth; whom he  ignorantly imagined to be the cause of his misery, whom his fancy  painted to him as endowed with the power of alleviating his sufferings:  it was thus in the extremity of his grief, in the exacerbation of his  mind, weighed down with misfortune, that unhappy man fashioned  those chimeras which filled him with the most gloomy ideas, which he  transmitted to his posterity, as the surest means of avoiding the evils  to which he had been himself subjected.    Man never judges of those objects of which he is ignorant, but through  the medium of those which come within his knowledge: thus man, taking  himself for the model, ascribed will, intelligence, design, projects,  passions; in a word, qualities analogous to his own, to all those  unknown causes of which he experienced the action. As soon as a visible  or supposed cause affects him in an agreeable manner, or in a mode  favourable to his existence, he concludes it to be good, to be well  intentioned towards him: on the contrary, he judges all those to be bad  in their nature, evilly disposed, to have the intention of injuring him,  which cause him any painful sensations. He attributes views, plans,  a system of conduct like his own, to every thing which to his limited  ideas appears of itself to produce connected effects; to act with  regularity; to constantly operate in the same manner; that uniformly  produces the same sensations in his own person. According to these  notions, which he always borrows from himself, from his own peculiar  mode of action, he either loves or fears those objects which have  affected him; he in consequence approaches them with confidence or  timidity; seeks after them or flies from them in proportion as the  feelings they have excited are either pleasant or painful. Having  travelled thus far, he presently addresses them; he invokes their aid;  prays to them for succour; conjures them to cease his afflictions;  to forbear tormenting him; as he finds himself sensible to presents,  pleased with submission, he tries to win them to his interests by  humiliation, by sacrifices; he exercises towards them the hospitality  he himself loves; he gives them an asylum; he builds them a dwelling;  he furnishes them with costly raiment; he makes their altars smoke with  delicious food; he proffers to their acceptance the earliest flowers of  spring; the finest fruits of autumn; the rich grain of summer; in short  he sets before them all those things which he thinks will please them  the most, because he himself places the highest value on them. These  dispositions enable us to account for the formation of tutelary gods,  of lares, of larvae, which every man makes to himself in savage and  unpolished nations. Thus we perceive that weak superstitious mortals,  ignorant of truth, devoid of experience, regard as the arbiters of their  fate, as the dispensers of good and evil, animals, stones, unformed  inanimate substances, which the effort of their heated imaginations  transform into gods, whom they invest with intelligence, whom they  clothe with desires, to whom they give volition.    Another disposition which serves to deceive the savage man, which will  equally deceive those whom reason shall not enlighten on these subjects,  is his attachment to omens; or the fortuitous concurrence of certain  effects, with causes which have not produced them; the co-existence  of these effects with certain causes, which have not the slightest  connection with them, has frequently led astray very intelligent beings;  nations who considered themselves very enlightened; who have either been  disinclined or unable to disentangle the one from the other: thus the  savage attributes bounty or the will to render him service, to any  object whether animate or inanimate, such as a stone of a certain form,  a rock, a mountain, a tree, a serpent, an owl, &c. if every time he  encounters these objects in a certain position, it should so happen that  he is more than ordinarily successful in hunting, that he should take an  unusual quantity of fish, that he should be victorious in war, or that  he should compass any enterprize whatever that he may at that moment  undertake: the same savage will be quite as gratuitous in attaching  malice, wickedness, the determination to injure him, to either the same  object in a different position, or any others in a given posture, which  way have met his eyes on those days when he shall have suffered some  grievous accident, have been very unsuccessful in his undertakings,  unfortunate in the chace, disappointed in his draught of fish: incapable  of reasoning he connects these effects with causes, that reflection  would convince him have nothing in common with each other; that are  entirely due to physical causes, to necessary circumstances, over which  neither himself nor his omens have the least controul: nevertheless he  finds it much easier to attribute them to these imaginary causes; he  therefore _deifies_ them; looks upon them as either his guardian angels,  or else as his most inveterate enemies. Having invested them with  supernatural powers, he becomes anxious to explain to himself their mode  of action; his self-love prevents his seeking elsewhere for the model:  thus he assigns them all those motives that actuate himself; he endows  them with passions; he gives them design--intelligence--will--imagines  they can either injure him or benefit him, as he may render them  propitious or otherwise to his views: he ends with worshipping them;  with paying them divine honours; he appoints them priests; or at least  always consults them before he undertakes any object of moment: such  is their influence, that if they put on the evil position, he will lay  aside the most important undertaking. The savage in this is never more  than an infant, that is angry with the object that displeases him; just  like the dog who gnaws the stone by which he has been wounded, without  recurring to the hand by which it was thrown.    Such is the foundation of man's faith, in either happy or unhappy omens:  devoid of experience, unaccustomed to reason with precision, fearing  to call in the evidence of truth, he looks upon them either as gods  themselves, or else as warnings given him by his other gods, to whom  he attributes the faculties of sagacity and foresight, of which he is  himself miserably deficient. Ignorance, when involved in disaster, when  immersed in trouble, believes a stone, a reptile, a bird, much better  instructed than himself. The slender observation of the ignorant only  serves to render him more superstitious; he sees certain birds announce  by their flight, by their cries, certain changes in the weather, such as  cold, heat, rain, storms; he beholds at certain periods, vapours arise "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#3)"],[1,"reached) it was found  to be about seven fathoms deep and nearly one hundred yards broad, with a  clear passage all the way up. I struck it about this point, and followed  it down, encamping fifteen miles from its mouth, and found the water  perfectly fresh, and the river broader and apparently very deep; the  country around most excellent, abundantly supplied with fresh water,  running in many flowing streams into the Adelaide River, the grass in  many places growing six feet high, and the herbage very close--a thing  seldom seen in a new country. The timber is chiefly composed of  stringy-bark, gum, myall, casurina, pine, and many other descriptions of  large timber, all of which will be most useful to new colonists. There is  also a plentiful supply of stone in the low rises suitable for building  purposes, and any quantity of bamboo can be obtained from the river from  two to fifty feet long. I measured one fifteen inches in circumference,  and saw many larger. The river abounds in fish and waterfowl of all  descriptions. On my arrival from the coast I kept more to the eastward of  my north course, with the intention of seeing further into the country. I  crossed the sources of the running streams before alluded to, and had  great difficulty in getting more to the west. They take their rise from  large bodies of springs coming from extensive grassy plains, which proves  there must be a very considerable underground drainage, as there are no  hills of sufficient elevation to cause the supply of water in these  streams. I feel confident that, if a new settlement is formed in this  splendid country, in a few years it will become one of the brightest gems  in the British Crown. To South Australia and some of the more remote  Australian colonies the benefits to be derived from the formation of such  a colony would be equally advantageous, creating an outlet for their  surplus beef and mutton, which would be eagerly consumed by the races in  the Indian Islands, and payment made by the shipment of their useful  ponies, and the other valuable products of those islands; indeed I see  one of the finest openings I am aware of for trading between these  islands and a colony formed where proposed.\"    Mr. Stuart was accompanied on his last journey by Mr. Waterhouse, a  clever naturalist, whose report to the Commissioner of Crown Lands of  South Australia, although too long for insertion here, is full of most  interesting information. Unfortunately, the interests of geographical  science were apparently lost sight of in the hurry to effect the grand  object of the expedition, namely, to cross from sea to sea. Thermometers  were forgotten; two mounted maps of the country from Chambers Creek to  Newcastle Water, in a tin case, never came to hand, and the expedition  was provided with no means of estimating even the approximate height of  the elevated land or of the mountains in the interior. As Mr. Waterhouse  remarks: \"The thermometers were much needed, as it would have been very  desirable to have kept a register of the temperature, and to have tested  occasionally the degree of heat at which water boiled on the high table  lands. The loss of the maps prevented my marking down at the time on the  maps the physical features of the country, and the distribution of its  fauna and flora.\"    Mr. Waterhouse divides the country into three divisions. The first, which  extends from Goolong Springs to a little north of the Gap in Hanson  Range, latitude 27 degrees 18 minutes 23 seconds, may be called the  spring and saltbush country. The second division commences north of the  Gap in Hanson Range, and extends to the southern side of Newcastle Water,  latitude 17 degrees 36 minutes 29 seconds. It is marked by great scarcity  of water--in fact, there are few places where water can be relied on as  permanent--and also by the presence of the porcupine grass (Triodia  pungens of Gregory, and Spinifex of Stuart), which is the prevailing  flora. The third division commences from the north end of Newcastle  Water, latitude 17 degrees 16 minutes 20 seconds, and extends to Van  Diemen Gulf, latitude 12 degrees 12 minutes 30 seconds; it comprises a  large part of Sturt Plains, with soil formed of a fine lacustrine  deposit, the valleys of the Roper filled with a luxuriant tropical  vegetation, and thence to the Adelaide River and the sea-coast.    On visiting Hergott Springs, Mr. Waterhouse learnt that Mr. Burtt, whose  station* is only a few miles distant, in opening these springs discovered  some fossil bones, casts of which were forwarded to Professor Owen, who  pronounced them to be the remains of a gigantic extinct marsupial, named  Diprotodon Australis. (* Hergott Springs were only discovered and named  by Stuart three years before, yet we now find a station close by them.  The explorer is not far ahead of his fellow-colonists, as is well  remarked by the Edinburgh Review for July, 1862: \"Australian occupation  has kept close on the heels of Australian discovery.\") Bones of this  animal have also been found in a newer tertiary formation in New South  Wales. Mr. Waterhouse considers that a great tertiary drift extends over  this part of the country, obscuring and concealing at no great depth  below the surface many springs, which may hereafter be discovered as the  country becomes better known.    The Louden Spa is a hot spring arising out of a small hillock, and  proceeds from the fissures of volcanic rock. This water is medicinal, but  not disagreeable to the taste: the damper made with it was very light,  and tasted like soda-bread.    In his remarks on the second division Mr. Waterhouse states much that is  valuable. He estimates the height of Mount Hay at two thousand feet,  regarding it as the highest point of the McDonnell Range, which is the  natural centre of this part of the continent. Mr. Waterhouse only saw  Chambers Pillar from a distance, but he had an opportunity of examining a  smaller hill of the same character, and found it to be composed of a soft  loose argillaceous rock, at the top of which was a thin stratum of a hard  siliceous rock, much broken up. \"The isolated hills appear to have been  at some remote period connected, but from the soft and loose nature of  the lower rock meeting with the action of water, had arisen a succession  of landslips. These have been washed away and others have followed in  their turn; the upper rock, from being undermined, has fallen down and  broken up, supplying the peculiar siliceous stones so widely distributed  on parts of the surface of the country.\"    The vegetation of this district is poor; the myall is scarce, but the  mulga (Acacia aneura) generally plentiful. Both these shrubs are species  of acacia, the myall being of much larger growth and longer lived than  the mulga. Nutritious grass is seldom found except in the immediate  vicinity of the creeks, and the scrubs are very extensive.    Mr. Waterhouse collected a great number of specimens of natural history,  but, from want of the convenience for carrying them, many of the more  delicate objects were broken.    In the Appendix will be found some remarks by Mr. John Gould, F.R.S.,  etc., on the birds collected by Mr. Waterhouse during Mr. Stuart's  expedition, including a description of a new and beautiful parrakeet.  There are also descriptions of new species of Freshwater Shells from the  same expedition, by Mr. Arthur Adams, F.L.S., and Mr. G. French Angas, to  the skill of which latter gentleman this work is indebted for its  admirable illustrations.    Dr. Muller, the Government Botanist, Director of the Botanic Garden at  Melbourne, in his report to both Houses of the Legislature of Victoria,  April 15th, 1863, says, \"A series of all the plants collected during Mr.  J.M. Stuart's last expedition was presented by the Hon. H. Strangways,  Commissioner of Crown Lands for South Australia, and those of the former  expeditions of that highly distinguished explorer, by the late J.  Chambers, Esquire, of North Adelaide.\" Of this collection, Dr. Muller has  furnished a systematic enumeration, which will be found in the Appendix.  This enumeration must not, however, be accepted as final, for Dr. Muller  has forwarded all the specimens to England for the inspection of Mr.  Bentham, the learned President of the Linnaean Society of London, who is  now elaborating his great and exhaustive work on the Flora of Australia,  the second volume of which will shortly be before the public.
