You didn't answer anybody's letters,  after--after----\"    \"After Richard died. Oh, I can talk about it, now. It was the best  thing that could happen for him, poor fellow. Life in hiding was  purgatory. No, I couldn't answer letters, though my old friends (you  among them) wanted to be kind. There wasn't anything I could let  anybody do for me. Monny Gilder's different. You'll soon see why.\"    I smiled indulgently. But, though I was to be introduced to Miss Gilder  for the purpose of being eventually gilded by her, at the instant my  thoughts were for my childhood's sweetheart.    Brigit Burne made a terrible mess of things in marrying, when she was  eighteen or so, Richard O'Brien, in the height of his celebrity as a  socialist leader. People still believed in him then, at the time of his  famous lecturing tour and visit to his birthplace on our green island;  and though he was more than twice her age, the fascination he had for  Biddy surprised few who knew him.    He was eloquent, in a fiery way. He had extraordinary eyes, and it was  his pride to resemble portraits of Lord Byron. After an acquaintance of  a month, Biddy married O'Brien (I had just gone up to Oxford at the  time, or I should have tried not to let it happen), went to America  with him, and voluntarily ceased to exist for her friends.    Poor girl, she must have had an awakening! He had posed as a bachelor;  but after her marriage she found out (and the world with her) that he  was a widower with one child, a little girl he had practically  abandoned. Biddy adopted her, though the mother had been a rather  undesirable Frenchwoman; and now when I saw her smiling at the tall  white girl on the _Laconia_, I had thought for an instant that Biddy  and her stepdaughter might be in flight together. O'Brien was a  drunkard, as well as a demagogue; and not long after Brigit's flitting  with him there was a scandal about the accepting of bribes from  politicians on the opposing side, apparently his greatest enemies; but  a minor scandal compared to what came some years afterward. O'Brien's  name was implicated in the blowing up of the _World-Republican_  Building in Washington, and the wrecking of Senator Marlowe's special  train after his speech against socialist interests, but the coward  turned informer against his friends and associates in the secret  society of which he had been a leader, and saved himself by sending  them to prison. From that day until his death he lived the life of a  hunted animal flying from the hounds of vengeance. Brigit stood by him  in spite of threats against her life as well as his, and the life of  the child. Since then, though she answered none of our letters, we had  heard rumours. The girl Esme, whom the avengers had threatened to  kidnap, was supposed to be hidden in some convent-school in Europe. As  for Brigit, she was said to be training for a hospital nurse: reported  to have become a missionary in India, China, and one or two other  countries; seen on the music-hall stage, and traced to Johannesburg,  where she had married a diamond-merchant; yet here she was on board the  _Laconia_, unchanged in looks, or nature, and the guest of a much  paragraphed, much proposed to American heiress _en route_ to Egypt.    While Brigit was telling me the real story of her last two years, as  governess, companion, teacher of music, and journalist, Miss Gilder  regarded us sidewise from amid her bodyguard of young men. Evidently  she was dying to know who was the acquaintance her darling Biddy had  picked up in mid-Mediterranean the moment her back was turned; and at  last, unable to restrain herself longer, she made use of some magic  trick to attach the band of youths to her aunt. Then, separating  herself with almost indecent haste from the group, she marched up to  us, gazing--I might say, staring--with large unfriendly eyes at the  intruder.    Brigit promptly accounted for me, however, rolling her \"r's\"  patriotically because I reminded her of Ireland. \"Do let me introduce  Lord Ernest Borrow,\" she said. \"I must have told you about him in my  stories, when you were a child, for he was me first love.\"    \"It was the other way round,\" I objected. \"She wouldn't look at me. I  adored her.\"    Biddy glared a warning. Her eyes said, \"Silly fellow, don't you know  every girl wants to be the one and only love of a man's life?\"    I had supposed that this old craze had gone out of fashion. But perhaps  there are a few primitive things which will never go out of fashion  with women.    Now that I had Miss Gilder's proud young face opposite mine, I saw that  it wasn't quite so perfect as I'd fancied when she flashed by in her  tall whiteness. Her nose, pure Greek in profile, seen in full was  --well, just neat American: a straight, determined little  twentieth-century nose. The full red mouth, not small, struck me as being  determined also, rather than classic, despite the daintily drawn  cupid's bow of the short upper lip. I realized too that the  long-lashed, wide-open, and wide-apart eyes were of the usual bluish-gray  possessed by half the girls one knows. And as for the thick wavy hair  pushed crisply forward by the white hood, now it was out of the sun's  glamour, there was more brown than gold in it. I said to myself, that  the face with the firm cleft chin was only just pretty enough to give a  great heiress or a youthful princess the reputation of a beauty; a  combination desired and generally produced by journalists. Then, as I  was thinking this, while Brigit explained me, Miss Gilder suddenly  smiled. I was dazzled. No wonder Biddy loved her. It would be a wonder  if I didn't love her myself before I knew what was happening.    And so I should instantly have done, perhaps, if it hadn't been for  Biddy's eyes seeming to come between mine and Miss Gilder's: and the  fact that at the moment I was in quest of another treasure than a  woman's heart. My thoughts were running ahead of the ship to  Alexandria, to find out from Anthony Fenton (\"Antoun Effendi\" the  biggest boys used to nickname him at school) more about the true  history of that treasure than he dared trust to paper and ink and the  post office.    So I put off falling in love with Rosamond Gilder till I should have  seen Anthony, and tidied up my distracted mind. A little later would  do, I told myself, because (owing to the fact that my ancestral castle  had figured in Biddy's tales of long ago) I was annexed as one of the  _proteges_; allowed to make a fifth at the small, flowery table under a  desirable porthole in the green and white restaurant; also I was  invited to go about with the ladies and show them Cairo. Just how much  \"going about,\" and falling in love, I should be able to do there,  depended on \"Antoun Effendi.\" But when Biddy congratulated me on my  luck, and chance of success in the \"scheme,\" I said nothing of Anthony.          CHAPTER II    CLEOPATRA AND THE SHIP'S MYSTERY      Now, at last, I can skip over the three days at sea, and get to our  arrival at Alexandria, because, as I've said, the exciting part began  soon after, at Cairo.    They were delightful days, for the _Laconia_ is a Paris hotel disguised  as a liner. And no man with blood in his veins could help enjoying the  society of Brigit O'Brien and Rosamond Gilder. Cleopatra, too, was not  to be despised as a charmer; and then there was the human interest of  the _protegees_, the one with the eyes and the one who had reluctantly  developed into the Ship's Mystery.    Still, in spite of Biddy and Monny and the others, and not for them, my  heart beat fast when, on the afternoon of the third day out from  Naples, the ship brought us suddenly in sight of something strange. We  were moving through a calm sea, more like liquefied marble than water,  for it was creamy white rather than blue, veined with azure, and  streaked, as marble is, with pink and gold. Far away across this  gleaming floor blossomed a long line of high-growing lotus flowers,  white and yellow against a silver sky. The effect was magical, and the  wonder grew when the big flower-bed turned into domes and cupolas and  spires rising out of the sea. Unimaginative people remarked that the  coast looked so flat and uninteresting they didn't see why Alexander  had wanted to bother with it; but they were the sort of people who  ought to stop at home in London or Birmingham or Chicago and not make  innocent fellow-passengers burn with unchristian feelings.    Soon I should see Anthony and hear his news. I felt sure he would be at  Alexandria to meet the ship. When \"Antoun Effendi\" makes up his mind to  do a thing, he will crawl from under a falling sky to do it. As the  _Laconia_ swept on, I hardly saw the glittering city on its vast  prayer-rug of green and gold, guarded by sea forts like sleepy  crocodiles. My mind's eyes were picturing Anthony as he would look  after his wild Balkan experiences: brown and lean, even haggard and  bearded, perhaps, a different man from the smart young officer of  everyday life, unless he'd contrived to refit in the short time since  his return to Egypt--a day or two at most, according to my calculation.  But all my imaginings fell short of the truth.    As I thought of Anthony, Mrs. East came and stood beside me. I knew she  was there before I turned to look, because of the delicate tinkling of  little Egyptian amulets, which is her accompaniment, her _leit motif_,  and because of the scent of sandalwood with which, in obedience to the  ancient custom of Egyptian queens, she perfumes her hair.    I don't think I have described Monny Gilder's aunt, according to my  conception of her, though I may have hinted at Biddy's. Biddy having a  habit of focussing her sense of humour on any female she doesn't wholly  love, may not do Mrs. East justice. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#3)"],[1,"a circumstance which  seemed to me rather to aggravate the offence.    \"I have regretted that refusal ever since,\" young Garland continued very  simply. \"It was a mistake at the time, but this week of all weeks it's  been a tragedy. Money I must have; I'll tell you why directly. When I got  your wire last night it seemed as though my wretched prayers had been  answered. I was going to someone else this morning, but I made up my mind  to wait for you instead. You were the one I really could turn to, and yet  I refused your great offer a month ago. But you said you would be back  to-night; and you weren't here when I came. I telephoned and found that  the train had come in all right, and that there wasn't another until the  morning. Tomorrow morning's my limit, and to-morrow's the match.\" He  stopped as he saw what Raffles was doing. \"Don't, Raffles, I don't  deserve it!\" he added in fresh distress.    But Raffles had unlocked the tantalus and found a syphon in the  corner cupboard, and it was a very yellow bumper that he handed to  the guilty youth.    \"Drink some,\" he said, \"or I won't listen to another word.\"    \"I'm going to be ruined before the match begins. I am!\" the poor fellow  insisted, turning to me when Raffles shook his head. \"And it'll break my  father's heart, and--and--\"    I thought he had worse still to tell us, he broke off in such despair;  but either he changed his mind, or the current of his thoughts set inward  in spite of him, for when he spoke again it was to offer us both a  further explanation of his conduct.    \"I only came up to leave a line for Raffles,\" he said to me, \"in case he  did get back in time. It was the porter himself who fixed me up at that  bureau. He'll tell you how many times I had called before. And then I saw  before my nose in one pigeon-hole your cheque-book, Raffles, and your  pass-book bulging with old cheques.\"    \"And as I wasn't back to write one for you,\" said Raffles, \"you wrote it  for me. And quite right, too!\"    \"Don't laugh at me!\" cried the boy, his lost colour rushing back. And he  looked at me again as though my long face hurt him less than the  sprightly sympathy of his friend.    \"I'm not laughing, Teddy,\" replied Raffles kindly. \"I was never more  serious in my life. It was playing the friend to come to me at all in  your fix, but it was the act of a real good pal to draw on me behind my  back rather than let me feel I'd ruined you by not turning up in time.  You may shake your head as hard as you like, but I never was paid a  higher compliment.\"    And the consummate casuist went on working a congenial vein until a less  miserable sinner might have been persuaded that he had done nothing  really dishonourable; but young Garland had the grace neither to make nor  to accept any excuse for his own conduct. I never heard a man more down  upon himself, or confession of error couched in stronger terms; and yet  there was something so sincere and ingenuous in his remorse, something  that Raffles and I had lost so long ago, that in our hearts I am sure we  took his follies more seriously than our own crimes. But foolish he  indeed had been, if not criminally foolish as he said. It was the old  story of the prodigal son of an indulgent father. There had been, as I  suspected, a certain amount of youthful riot which the influence of  Raffles had already quelled; but there had also been much reckless  extravagance, of which Raffles naturally knew less, since your scapegrace  is constitutionally quicker to confess himself as such than as a fool.  Suffice it that this one had thrown himself on his father's generosity,  only to find that the father himself was in financial straits.    \"What!\" cried Raffles, \"with that house on his hands?\"    \"I knew it would surprise you,\" said Teddy Garland. \"I can't understand  it myself; he gave me no particulars, but the mere fact was enough for  me. I simply couldn't tell my father everything after that. He wrote me a  cheque for all I did own up to, but I could see it was such a tooth that  I swore I'd never come on him to pay another farthing. And I never will!\"    The boy took a sip from his glass, for his voice had faltered, and then  he paused to light another cigarette, because the last had gone out  between his fingers. So sensitive and yet so desperate was the blonde  young face, with the creased forehead and the nervous mouth, that I saw  Raffles look another way until the match was blown out.    \"But at the time I might have done worse, and did,\" said Teddy, \"a  thousand times! I went to the Jews. That's the whole trouble. There were  more debts--debts of honour--and to square up I went to the Jews. It was  only a matter of two or three hundred to start with; but you may know,  though I didn't, what a snowball the smallest sum becomes in the hands of  those devils. I borrowed three hundred and signed a promissory note for  four hundred and fifty-six.\"    \"Only fifty per cent!\" said Raffles. \"You got off cheap if the percentage  was per annum.\"    \"Wait a bit! It was by way of being even more reasonable than that. The  four hundred and fifty-six was repayable in monthly instalments of twenty  quid, and I kept them up religiously until the sixth payment fell due.  That was soon after Christmas, when one's always hard up, and for the  first time I was a day or two late--not more, mind you; yet what do you  suppose happened? My cheque was returned, and the whole blessed balance  demanded on the nail!\"    Raffles was following intently, with that complete concentration which  was a signal force in his equipment. His face no longer changed at  anything he heard; it was as strenuously attentive as that of any judge  upon the bench. Never had I clearer vision of the man he might have been  but for the kink in his nature which had made him what he was.    \"The promissory note was for four-fifty-six,\" said he, \"and this sudden  demand was for the lot less the hundred you had paid?\"    \"That's it.\"    \"What did you do?\" I asked, not to seem behind Raffles in my grasp  of the case.    \"Told them to take my instalment or go to blazes for the rest!\"    \"And they?\"    \"Absolutely drop the whole thing until this very week, and then come down  on me for--what do you suppose?\"    \"Getting on for a thousand,\" said Raffles after a moment's thought.    \"Nonsense!\" I cried. Garland looked astonished too.    \"Raffles knows all about it,\" said he. \"Seven hundred was the actual  figure. I needn't tell you I have given the bounders a wide berth since  the day I raised the wind; but I went and had it out with them over this.  And half the seven hundred is for default interest, I'll trouble you,  from the beginning of January down to date!\"    \"Had you agreed to that?\"    \"Not to my recollection, but there it was as plain as a pikestaff on my  promissory note. A halfpenny in the shilling per week over and above  everything else when the original interest wasn't forthcoming.\"    \"Printed or written on your note of hand?\"    \"Printed--printed small, I needn't tell you--but quite large enough for  me to read when I signed the cursed bond. In fact I believe I did read  it; but a halfpenny a week! Who could ever believe it would mount up like  that? But it does; it's right enough, and the long and short of it is  that unless I pay up by twelve o'clock to-morrow the governor's to be  called in to say whether he'll pay up for me or see me made a bankrupt  under his nose. Twelve o'clock, when the match begins! Of course they  know that, and are trading on it. Only this evening I had the most  insolent ultimatum, saying it was my 'dead and last chance.'\"    \"So then you came round here?\"    \"I was coming in any case. I wish I'd shot myself first!\"    \"My dear fellow, it was doing me proud; don't let us lose our sense of  proportion, Teddy.\"    But young Garland had his face upon his hand, and once more he was the  miserable man who had begun brokenly to unfold the history of his shame.  The unconscious animation produced by the mere unloading of his heart,  the natural boyish slang with which his tale had been freely garnished,  had faded from his face, had died upon his lips. Once more he was a soul  in torments of despair and degradation; and yet once more did the absence  of the abject in man and manner redeem him from the depths of either. In  these moments of reaction he was pitiful, but not contemptible, much less  unlovable. Indeed, I could see the qualities that had won the heart of  Raffles as I had never seen them before. There is a native nobility not  to be destroyed by a single descent into the ignoble, an essential  honesty too bright and brilliant to be dimmed by incidental dishonour;  and both remained to the younger man, in the eyes of the other two, who  were even then determining to preserve in him all that they themselves  had lost. The thought came naturally enough to me. And yet I may well  have derived it from a face that for once was easy to read, a clear-cut  face that had never looked so sharp in profile, or, to my knowledge, half  so gentle in expression.    \"And what about these Jews?\" asked Raffles at length.    \"There's really only one.\"    \"Are we to guess his name?\"    \"No, I don't mind telling you. It's Dan Levy.\"    \"Of course it is!\" cried Raffles with a nod for me. \"Our Mr. Shylock in  all his glory!\"    Teddy snatched his face from his hands.    \"You don't know him, do you?\"    \"I might almost say I know him at home,\" said Raffles. \"But as a matter  of fact I met him abroad.\"    Teddy was on his feet.    \"But do you know him well enough--\"    \"Certainly. I'll see him in the morning. But I ought to have the receipts  for the various instalments you have paid, and perhaps that letter saying  it was your last chance.\"    \"Here they all are,\" said Garland, producing a bulky envelope. \"But of  course I'll come with you--\"    \"Of course you'll do nothing of the kind, Teddy! I won't have your eye  put out for the"]]]
