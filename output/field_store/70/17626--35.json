Of course this story is  exaggerated, but without doubt the tower rose to a great height and was  a wonderful piece of work.    God was not pleased with what the people were doing, however, because  they thought themselves so great and powerful that they had no need of  Him, and so He put an end to their bold plans.    Up to this time all the people of the world had spoken the same  language; but now, when they were working upon this wonderful tower,  they commenced to talk in different tongues so that they could not  understand each other, and there was great confusion. Owing to this,  they were obliged to give up the building of the tower, and they  separated themselves into groups, or divisions, each division speaking  the same language, and then they spread out over the world, forming the  various nations.    The tower was called the Tower of Babel because of the babel, or  confusion, of tongues which had taken place there, and it was left  unfinished to be a monument of God's power and man's weakness without  Him.    [Illustration: THE TOWER OF BABEL.]    These men were skillful in building, else they never could have gone as  far as they did in their stupendous work, and God was willing that they  should exercise their skill, as He is willing that people shall do now;  but when they thought themselves equal to Him, they learned how weak  they really were in comparison. The story teaches the great lesson of  dependence upon God and submission to His will and His laws.          THE BOYHOOD OF JESUS.      There are many beautiful stories of child-life, but the story of the  Boyhood of Jesus is the most beautiful of all. It teaches a wonderful  lesson of obedience to parents and love and respect for them, as well as  of the charm of a pure and consecrated childhood, and the lesson is all  the more helpful because it is full of the human interest of everyday  life.    Although the boy Jesus was gifted with a wisdom far beyond His years--a  wisdom which was His because He was the Son of God, yet He lived much as  other boys lived, doing the tasks that were given Him by His parents and  being subject to them in all things.    Probably the people around Him did not think very much about what He  said or did during those years. When they saw Him helping Joseph, the  carpenter, or doing the little things which Mary, His mother, bade Him  do, He seemed much like other little boys to them; they thought Him  bright and pleasing, and it may be that there was something in His looks  and in His manner which puzzled them, which set them to thinking of holy  things in a wondering way; but Mary was the only one who dwelt upon the  mystery of His life with a constant prayerful questioning as to just  what the meaning of it was.    Mary treasured all His sayings in her heart and believed that the time  would come when everyone would know that He was not simply an ordinary  child like those around Him.    After Joseph had brought his family back from Egypt because, now that  Herod was dead, it was safe for them to come into their own country  again, they lived in the city of Nazareth, and so the words of the old  prophets were true, that Jesus, the Savior of the World, should be a  Nazarene, or dweller in Nazareth.    Every year the Jews held a feast at Jerusalem called the Feast of the  Passover, in memory of the time when God passed over, or spared, His  chosen people in Egypt, although He destroyed the first-born of the  Egyptians. When Jesus was twelve years old He went to Jerusalem with  Joseph and Mary to attend this feast.    There were many of the relatives and friends of the family there, and  when they started home after the feast, there was probably some  confusion about getting the company under way, for they traveled in a  train consisting of people on foot and mounted upon donkeys, and they  had, of course, some needful provisions to take with them, together with  the things which they had brought for their comfort upon the journey and  during their stay in Jerusalem; and as the parents of Jesus did not  think of His remaining behind, they neglected to look for Him, supposing  He was somewhere in the train; so, when they had traveled for a day on  the return trip, they were greatly surprised and troubled to find that  He was missing.    They immediately started back for Jerusalem, wondering as they went what  could have happened to their boy and fearful about it; but after three  anxious days they found Him in the temple talking with the learned men  there, listening to their wise words, and asking questions which  astonished everybody who heard them, because they were full of an  understanding of holy things that was not to be expected of a boy.  When His parents had found Him, Mary said to Him, sorrowfully, \"Son, why  hast Thou dealt thus with us? Thy father and I have sought Thee  sorrowing.\"    Then Jesus turned to her with sad and gentle respect, and asked, \"How is  it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not\"--that is, \"Do you not know\"--\"that I  must be about My Father's business?\"    Perhaps in these words He tried to give them an insight into the great  meaning of His life; but they were puzzled, although Mary dimly felt all  that He would have her understand. He did not at this time, however,  explain to them further regarding what was in His own heart. It may be  that He did not yet fully comprehend just what He was to do. He had  taken upon Himself the human nature which He was to raise to something  grander and nobler than human nature had ever been before, and in  becoming a little child like other little children, perhaps it was God's  plan that He should not yet have the judgment of a man in all things.    However that may have been, He went back with His parents and obeyed  them as before, for the time had not come for Him to leave them and  begin His teaching, except as He taught by the force of a beautiful  example. But that example formed a great part of the purpose for which  He was sent into the world, because one of the noblest truths that He  impressed upon humanity was the duty of children to parents. His own  life taught this better than any sermon could have done, for in all the  history of the world we have no better example of what a child's conduct  should be toward his parents. It is the more beautiful because Jesus was  not like other children, but, having the wisdom of God in His heart, was  far better able to judge for Himself between right and wrong.    During all these years Jesus grew in stature as well as in wisdom, and  those around Him felt, without understanding it, that in some way He was  different from the rest. The divinity of His nature could not be hidden,  even in those early years, but it shone through all the small acts of  everyday life, making them beautiful; while every one who knew Him was  better and happier for coming near such a noble nature.    [Illustration: THE QUEST.]    [Illustration: =The Angels' Song=        \"Praise thou the Lord!\" the angels cry         The song of peace and love,       Comes floating downward thro' the sky,         From unseen courts above.  ]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#4)"],[1," from my ancestors; and it has  been my care not only to preserve these estates, but to increase them  so far as I was able by my industry.' The Magnificent then added:  'Well, look about, and see if there be anything in Florence which will  suit you. Make use of me, for I will do the utmost that I can for  you.' It so happened that a place in the Customs, which could only be  filled by a Florentine citizen, fell vacant shortly afterwards. Upon  this Lodovico returned to the Magnificent, and begged for it in these  words: 'Lorenzo, I am good for nothing but reading and writing. Now,  the mate of Marco Pucci in the Customs having died, I should like to  enter into this office, feeling myself able to fulfil its duties  decently.' The Magnificent laid his hand upon his shoulder, and said  with a smile: 'You will always be a poor man;' for he expected him to  ask for something far more valuable. Then he added: 'If you care to be  the mate of Marco, you can take the post, until such time as a better  becomes vacant.' It was worth eight crowns the month, a little more or  a little less.\" A document is extant which shows that Lodovico  continued to fill this office at the Customs till 1494, when the heirs  of Lorenzo were exiled; for in the year 1512, after the Medici  returned to Florence, he applied to Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, to be  reinstated in the same.    If it is true, as Vasari asserts, that Michelangelo quitted  Ghirlandajo in 1489, and if Condivi is right in saying that he only  lived in the Casa Medici for about two years before the death of  Lorenzo, April 1492, then he must have spent some twelve months  working in the gardens at San Marco before the Faun's mask called  attention to his talents. His whole connection with Lorenzo, from the  spring of 1489 to the spring of 1492, lasted three years; and, since  he was born in March 1475, the space of his life covered by this  patronage extended from the commencement of his fifteenth to the  commencement of his eighteenth year.    These three years were decisive for the development of his mental  faculties and special artistic genius. It is not necessary to enlarge  here upon Lorenzo de' Medici's merits and demerits, either as the  ruler of Florence or as the central figure in the history of the  Italian Renaissance. These have supplied stock topics for discussion  by all writers who have devoted their attention to that period of  culture. Still we must remember that Michelangelo enjoyed singular  privileges under the roof of one who was not only great as diplomatist  and politician, and princely in his patronage, but was also a man of  original genius in literature, of fine taste in criticism, and of  civil urbanity in manners. The palace of the Medici formed a museum,  at that period unique, considering the number and value of its art  treasures--bas-reliefs, vases, coins, engraved stones, paintings by  the best contemporary masters, statues in bronze and marble by  Verocchio and Donatello. Its library contained the costliest  manuscripts, collected from all quarters of Europe and the Levant. The  guests who assembled in its halls were leaders in that intellectual  movement which was destined to spread a new type of culture far and  wide over the globe. The young sculptor sat at the same board as  Marsilio Ficino, interpreter of Plato; Pico della Mirandola, the  phoenix of Oriental erudition; Angelo Poliziano, the unrivalled  humanist and melodious Italian poet; Luigi Pulci, the humorous  inventor of burlesque romance--with artists, scholars, students  innumerable, all in their own departments capable of satisfying a  youth's curiosity, by explaining to him the particular virtues of  books discussed, or of antique works of art inspected. During those  halcyon years, before the invasion of Charles VIII., it seemed as  though the peace of Italy might last unbroken. No one foresaw the  apocalyptic vials of wrath which were about to be poured forth upon  her plains and cities through the next half-century. Rarely, at any  period of the world's history, perhaps only in Athens between the  Persian and the Peloponnesian wars, has culture, in the highest and  best sense of that word, prospered more intelligently and pacifically  than it did in the Florence of Lorenzo, through the co-operation and  mutual zeal of men of eminence, inspired by common enthusiasms, and  labouring in diverse though cognate fields of study and production.    Michelangelo's position in the house was that of an honoured guest or  adopted son. Lorenzo not only allowed him five ducats a month by way  of pocket-money, together with clothes befitting his station, but he  also, says Condivi, \"appointed him a good room in the palace, together  with all the conveniences he desired, treating him in every respect,  as also at his table, precisely like one of his own sons. It was the  custom of this household, where men of the noblest birth and highest  public rank assembled round the daily board, for the guests to take  their places next the master in the order of their arrival; those who  were present at the beginning of the meal sat, each according to his  degree, next the Magnificent, not moving afterwards for any one who  might appear. So it happened that Michelangelo found himself  frequently seated above Lorenzo's children and other persons of great  consequence, with whom that house continually flourished and abounded.  All these illustrious men paid him particular attention, and  encouraged him in the honourable art which he had chosen. But the  chief to do so was the Magnificent himself, who sent for him  oftentimes in a day, in order that he might show him jewels,  cornelians, medals, and such-like objects of great rarity, as knowing  him to be of excellent parts and judgment in these things.\" It does  not appear that Michelangelo had any duties to perform or services to  render. Probably his patron employed him upon some useful work of the  kind suggested by Condivi. But the main business of his life in the  Casa Medici was to make himself a valiant sculptor, who in after years  should confer lustre on the city of the lily and her Medicean masters.  What he produced during this period seems to have become his own  property, for two pieces of statuary, presently to be described,  remained in the possession of his family, and now form a part of the  collection in the Casa Buonarroti.      VI    Angelo Poliziano, who was certainly the chief scholar of his age in  the new learning, and no less certainly one of its truest poets in the  vulgar language, lived as tutor to Lorenzo's children in the palace of  the Medici at Florence. Benozzo Gozzoli introduced his portrait,  together with the portraits of his noble pupils, in a fresco of the  Pisan Campo Santo. This prince of humanists recommended Michelangelo  to treat in bas-relief an antique fable, involving the strife of young  heroes for some woman's person. Probably he was also able to point out  classical examples by which the boyish sculptor might be guided in the  undertaking. The subject made enormous demands upon his knowledge of  the nude. Adult and youthful figures, in attitudes of vehement attack  and resistance, had to be modelled; and the conditions of the myth  required that one at least of them should be brought into harmony with  equine forms. Michelangelo wrestled vigorously with these  difficulties. He produced a work which, though it is imperfect and  immature, brings to light the specific qualities of his inherent  art-capacity. The bas-relief, still preserved in the Casa Buonarroti  at Florence, is, so to speak, in fermentation with powerful  half-realised conceptions, audacities of foreshortening, attempts at  intricate grouping, violent dramatic action and expression. No  previous tradition, unless it was the genius of Greek or Greco-Roman  antiquity, supplied Michelangelo with the motive force for this  prentice-piece in sculpture. Donatello and other Florentines worked  under different sympathies for form, affecting angularity in their  treatment of the nude, adhering to literal transcripts from the model  or to conventional stylistic schemes. Michelangelo discarded these  limitations, and showed himself an ardent student of reality in the  service of some lofty intellectual ideal. Following and closely  observing Nature, he was also sensitive to the light and guidance of  the classic genius. Yet, at the same time, he violated the aesthetic  laws obeyed by that genius, displaying his Tuscan proclivities by  violent dramatic suggestions, and in loaded, overcomplicated  composition. Thus, in this highly interesting essay, the horoscope of  the mightiest Florentine artist was already cast. Nature leads him,  and he follows Nature as his own star bids. But that star is double,  blending classic influence with Tuscan instinct. The roof of the  Sistine was destined to exhibit to an awe-struck world what wealths of  originality lay in the artist thus gifted, and thus swayed by rival  forces. For the present, it may be enough to remark that, in the  geometrical proportions of this bas-relief, which is too high for its  length, Michelangelo revealed imperfect feeling for antique  principles; while, in the grouping of the figures, which is more  pictorial than sculpturesque, he already betrayed, what remained with  him a defect through life, a certain want of organic or symmetrical  design in compositions which are not rigidly subordinated to  architectural framework or limited to the sphere of an _intaglio_.    Vasari mentions another bas-relief in marble as belonging to this  period, which, from its style, we may, I think, believe to have been  designed earlier than the Centaurs. It is a seated Madonna with the  Infant Jesus, conceived in the manner of Donatello, but without that  master's force and power over the lines of drapery. Except for the  interest attaching to it as an early work of Michelangelo, this piece"]]]
