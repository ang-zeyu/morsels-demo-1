CHAPTER II.    _Departure of the \"Pole Star\" for the Frozen Seas--Sage reflections of  Mrs. Bright, and sagacious remarks of Buzzby--Anxieties, fears,  surmises, and resolutions--Isabel--A search proposed--Departure of the  \"Dolphin\" for the Far North_.      Digressions are bad at the best, and we feel some regret that we should  have been compelled to begin our book with one; but they are necessary  evils sometimes, so we must ask our reader's forgiveness, and beg him,  or her, to remember that we are still at the commencement of our story,  standing at the end of the pier, and watching the departure of the _Pole  Star_ whale-ship, which is now a scarcely distinguishable speck on the  horizon.    As it disappeared Buzzby gave a grunt, Fred and Isobel uttered a sigh in  unison, and Mrs. Bright resumed the fit of weeping which for some time  she had unconsciously suspended.    \"I fear we shall never see him again,\" sobbed Mrs. Bright, as she took  Isobel by the hand and sauntered slowly home, accompanied by Fred and  Buzzby, the latter of whom seemed to regard himself in the light of a  shaggy Newfoundland or mastiff, who had been left to protect the family.  \"We are always hearing of whale-ships being lost, and, somehow or  other, we _never_ hear of the crews being saved, as one reads of when  ships are wrecked in the usual way on the seashore.\"    Isobel squeezed her mother's hand, and looked up in her face with an  expression that said plainly, \"Don't cry so, mamma; I'm _sure_ he will  come back,\" but she could not find words to express herself, so she  glanced towards the mastiff for help.    Buzzby felt that it devolved upon him to afford consolation under the  circumstances; but Mrs. Bright's mind was of that peculiar stamp which  repels advances in the way of consolation unconsciously, and Buzzby was  puzzled. He screwed up first the right eye and then the left, and smote  his thigh repeatedly; and assuredly, if contorting his visage could have  comforted Mrs. Bright, she would have returned home a happy woman, for  he made faces at her violently for full five minutes. But it did her no  good, perhaps because she didn't see him, her eyes being suffused with  tears.    \"Ah! yes,\" resumed Mrs. Bright, with another burst, \"I _know_ they will  never come back, and your silence shows that you think so too. And to  think of their taking two years' provisions with them _in case of  accidents!_--doesn't that prove that there are going _to be_ accidents?  And didn't I hear one of the sailors say that she was a crack ship, a  number one? I don't know what he meant by A number one, but if she's a  cracked ship I _know_ she will never come back; and although I told my  dear brother of it, and advised him not to go, he only laughed at me,  which was very unkind, I'm sure.\"    Here Mrs. Bright's feelings overcame her again.    \"Why, aunt,\" said Fred, scarce able to restrain a laugh, despite the  sadness that lay at his heart, \"when the sailor said it was a crack  ship, he meant that it was a good one, a first-rate one.\"    \"Then why did he not say what he meant? But you are talking nonsense,  boy. Do you think that I will believe a man means to say a thing is good  when he calls it cracked? and I'm sure nobody would say a cracked  tea-pot was as good as a whole one. But tell me, Buzzby, do you think  they ever _will_ come back?\"    \"Why, ma'am, in coorse I do,\" replied Buzzby, vehemently; \"for why, if  they don't, they're the first that ever, went out o' this port in my day  as didn't. They've a good ship and lots o' grub, and it's like to be a  good season; and Captain Ellice has, for the most part, good luck; and  they've started with a fair wind, and kep' clear of a Friday, and what  more could ye wish? I only wish as I was aboard along with them, that's  all.\"    Buzzby delivered himself of this oration with the left eye shut and  screwed up, and the right one open. Having concluded, he shut and  screwed up the right eye, and opened the left--he reversed the engine,  so to speak, as if he wished to back out from the scene of his triumph  and leave the course clear for others to speak. But his words were  thrown away on Mrs. Bright, who was emphatically a weak-minded woman,  and never exercised her reason at all, except in a spasmodic, galvanic  sort of way, when she sought to defend or to advocate some unreasonable  conclusion of some sort, at which her own weak mind had arrived somehow.  So she shook her head, and sobbed good-bye to Buzzby, as she ascended  the sloping avenue that led to her pretty cottage on the green hill that  overlooked the harbour and the sea beyond.    As for John Buzzby, having been absent from home full half-an-hour  beyond his usual dinner-hour, he felt that, for a man who had lashed his  helm amid-ships, he was yawing alarmingly out of his course; so he  spread all the canvas he could carry, and steered right before the wind  towards the village, where, in a little whitewashed, low-roofed,  one-doored, and two little-windowed cottage, his spouse (and dinner)  awaited him.    To make a long story short, three years passed away, but the _Pole Star_  did not return, and no news of her could be got from the various  whale-ships that visited the port of Grayton. Towards the end of the  second year Buzzby began to shake his head despondingly; and as the  third drew to a close, the expression of gloom never left his honest,  weather-beaten face. Mrs. Bright, too, whose anxiety at first was only  half genuine, now became seriously alarmed, and the fate of the missing  brig began to be the talk of the neighbourhood. Meanwhile, Fred Ellice  and Isobel grew and improved in mind and body; but anxiety as to his  father's fate rendered the former quite unable to pursue his studies,  and he determined at last to procure a passage in a whale-ship, and go  out in search of the brig.    It happened that the principal merchant and shipowner in the town, Mr.  Singleton by name, was an intimate friend and old school-fellow of  Captain Ellice, so Fred went boldly to him and proposed that a vessel  should be fitted out immediately, and sent off to search for his  father's brig. Mr. Singleton smiled at the request, and pointed out the  utter impossibility of his agreeing to it; but he revived Fred's sinking  hopes by saying that he was about to send out a whaler to the Northern  Seas at any rate, and that he would give orders to the captain to devote  a _portion_ of his time to the search, and, moreover, agreed to let Fred  go as a passenger in company with his own son Tom.    Now, Tom Singleton had been Fred's bosom friend and companion during his  first year at school; but during the last two years he had been sent to  the Edinburgh University to prosecute his medical studies, and the two  friends had only met at rare intervals. It was with unbounded delight,  therefore, that he found his old companion, now a youth of twenty, was  to go out as surgeon of the ship, and he could scarce contain himself as  he ran down to Buzzby's cottage to tell him the good news, and ask him  to join.    Of course Buzzby was ready to go, and, what was of far greater  importance in the matter, his wife threw no obstacle in the way. On the  contrary, she undid the lashings of the helm with her own hand, and told  her wondering partner, with a good-humoured but firm smile, to steer  where he chose, and she would content herself with the society of the  two young Buzzbys (both miniature fac-similes of their father) till he  came back.    Once again a whale-ship prepared to sail from the port of Grayton, and  once again Mrs. Bright and Isobel stood on the pier to see her depart.  Isobel was about thirteen now, and as pretty a girl, according to  Buzzby, as you could meet with in any part of Britain. Her eyes were  blue and her hair nut-brown, and her charms of face and figure were  enhanced immeasurably by an air of modesty and earnestness that went  straight home to your heart, and caused you to adore her at once. Buzzby  doated on her as if she were his only child, and felt a secret pride in  being in some indefinable way her protector. Buzzby philosophized about  her, too, after a strange fashion. \"You see,\" he would say to Fred,  \"it's not that her figurehead is cut altogether after a parfect  pattern--by no means, for I've seen pictur's and statues that wos  better--but she carries her head a little down, d'ye see, Master Fred?  and there's where it is; that's the way I gauges the worth o' young  women, jist accordin' as they carry their chins up or down. If their  brows come well for'ard, and they seems to be lookin' at the ground they  walk on, I knows their brains is firm stuff, and in good workin' order;  but when I sees them carryin' their noses high out o' the water, as if  they wos afeard o' catchin' sight o' their own feet, and their chins  elewated, so that a little boy standin' in front o' them couldn't see  their faces nohow, I make pretty sure that t'other end is filled with a  sort o' _mush_ that's fit only to think o' dress and dancing.\"    On the present occasion Isobel's eyes were red and swollen, and by no  means improved by weeping. Mrs. Bright, too, although three years had  done little to alter her character, seemed to be less demonstrative and  much more sincere than usual in her grief at parting from Fred.    In a few minutes all was ready. Young Singleton and Buzzby having  hastily but earnestly bade Mrs. Bright and her daughter farewell, leaped  on board. Fred lingered for a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#4)"],[1,"V. Composite Verse      Observations on Composites      Section V.
