[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10852"],[0,"Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs (#4)"],[1," trifurca_).--China, 1852. This is a shrub of  neat low growth, but it does not appear to be at all plentiful.    B. VULGARIS.--Common Barberry. This is a native species, with oblong  leaves, and terminal, drooping racemes of yellow flowers. It is  chiefly valued for the great wealth of orange-scarlet fruit. There are  two very distinct forms, one bearing silvery and the other black  fruit, and named respectively B. vulgaris fructo-albo and B. vulgaris  fructo-nigro.    B. WALLICHIANA (_syn B. Hookeri_).--Nepaul, 1820. This is exceedingly  ornamental, whether as regards the foliage, flowers, or fruit. It is  of dense, bushy growth, with large, dark green spiny leaves, and an  abundance of clusters of clear yellow flowers. The berries are deep  violet-purple, and fully half-an-inch long. Being perfectly hardy and  of free growth it is well suited for extensive planting.      BERCHEMIA.    BERCHEMIA VOLUBILIS.--Climbing Berchemia. Carolina, 1714. A rarely  seen, deciduous climber, bearing rather inconspicuous greenish-yellow  flowers, succeeded by attractive, violet-tinted berries. The foliage  is neat and pretty, the individual leaves being ovate in shape and  slightly undulated or wavy. It is a twining shrub that in this  country, even under favourable circumstances, one rarely sees  ascending to a greater height than about 12 feet. Sandy peat and a  shady site suits it best, and so placed it will soon cover a  low-growing tree or bush much in the way that our common Honeysuckle  does. It is propagated from layers or cuttings.      BIGNONIA.    BIGNONIA CAPREOLATA--Virginia and other parts of America, 1710. This  is not so hardy as to be depended upon throughout the country  generally, though in the milder parts of England and Ireland it  succeeds well as a wall plant. It is a handsome climbing shrub, with  long, heart-shaped leaves, usually terminating in branched tendrils,  and large orange flowers produced singly.      BILLARDIERA.    BILLARDIERA LONGIFLORA.--Blue Apple Berry. Van Diemen's Land, 1810. If  only for its rich, blue berries, as large as those of a cherry, this  otherwise elegant climbing shrub is well worthy of a far greater share  of attention than it has yet received, for it must be admitted that it  is far from common. The greenish bell-shaped blossoms produced in May  are, perhaps, not very attractive, but this is more than compensated  for by the highly ornamental fruit, which renders the plant an object  of great beauty about mid-September. Leaves small and narrow, on  slender, twining stems, that clothe well the lower half of a garden  wall in some sunny favoured spot. Cuttings root freely if inserted in  sharp sand and placed in slight heat, while seeds germinate quickly.      BRYANTHUS.    BRYANTHUS ERECTUS.--Siberia. This is a pretty little Ericaceous plant,  nearly allied to Menziesia, and with a plentiful supply of dark-green  leaves. The flowers, which are borne in crowded clusters at the points  of the shoots, are bell-shaped, and of a pleasing reddish-lilac colour.  It wants a cool, moist peaty soil, and is perfectly hardy. When in a  flowering stage the Bryanthus is one of the brightest occupants of the  peat bed, and is a very suitable companion for such dwarf plants as   the Heaths, Menziesias, and smaller growing Kalmias.    B. EMPETRIFORMIS (_syn Menziesia empetrifolia_).--North America, 1829.  This is a compact, neat species, and well suited for alpine gardening.  The flowers are rosy-purple, and produced abundantly.      BUDDLEIA.    BUDDLEIA GLOBOSA.--Orange Ball Tree. Chili, 1774. A shrubby species,  ranging in height from 12 feet to 20 feet, and the only one at all  common in gardens. Favoured spots in Southern England would seem to  suit the plant fairly well, but to see it at its best one must visit  some of the maritime gardens of North Wales, where it grows stout and  strong, and flowers with amazing luxuriance. Where it thrives it must  be ranked amongst the most beautiful of wall plants, for few, indeed,  are the standard specimens that are to be met with, the protection  afforded by a wall being almost a necessity in its cultivation. The  leaves are linear-lanceolate, and covered with a dense silvery  tomentum on the under side, somewhat rugose above, and partially  deciduous. Flowers in small globular heads, bright orange or yellow,  and being plentifully produced are very showy in early summer. It  succeeds well in rich moist loam on gravel.    B. LINDLEYANA.--China, 1844. This has purplish-red flowers and angular  twigs, but it cannot be relied upon unless in very sheltered and mild  parts of the country.    B. PANICULATA (_syn B. crispa_).--Nepaul, 1823. This may at once be  distinguished by its curly, woolly leaves, and fragrant lilac flowers.  It is a desirable species, but suffers from our climate.      BUPLEURUM.    BUPLEURUM FRUTICOSUM.--Hare's Ear. South Europe, 1596. A small-growing,  branching shrub, with obovate-lanceolate leaves, and compound umbels  of yellowish flowers. It is more curious than beautiful.      CAESALPINIA.    CAESALPINIA SEPIARIA (_syn C. japonica_).--India, 1857. This is as yet  a comparatively little known shrub, but one that from its beauty and  hardihood is sure to become a general favourite. Planted out in a  light, sandy, peaty soil, and where fully exposed, this shrub has done  well, and proved itself a suitable subject for the climate of England  at least. The hard prickles with which both stem and branches are  provided renders the shrub of rather formidable appearance, while the  leaves are of a peculiarly pleasing soft-green tint. For the flowers,  too, it is well worthy of attention, the pinky anthers contrasting so  markedly with the deep yellow of the other portions of the flower.  They are arranged in long racemes, and show well above the foliage.      CALLUNA.    CALLUNA VULGARIS (_syn Erica vulgaris_).--Common Ling on Heather. This  is the commonest native species, with purplish-pink flowers on small  pedicels. There are many very distinct and beautiful-flowering forms,  the following being some of the best: C. vulgaris alba, white-flowered;  C. vulgaris Hammondi, C. vulgaris minor, and C. vulgaris pilosa, all  white-flowered forms; C. vulgaris Alportii, and C. vulgaris Alportii  variegata, the former bearing rich crimson flowers, and the latter with  distinctly variegated foliage; C. vulgaris argentea, and C. vulgaris  aurea, with silvery-variegated and golden foliage; C. vulgaris  flore-pleno, a most beautiful and free-growing variety, with double  flowers; C. vulgaris Foxii, a dwarf plant that does not flower freely;  and C. vulgaris pumila, and C. vulgaris dumosa, which are of small  cushion-like growth.      CALOPHACA.    CALOPHACA WOLGARICA.--Siberia, 1786. This member of the Pea family is  of dwarf, branching growth, thickly clothed with glandular hairs, and  bears yellow flowers, succeeded by reddish-purple pods. It is of no  special importance as an ornamental shrub, and is most frequently seen  grafted on the Laburnum, though its natural easy habit of growth is far  preferable. Hailing from Siberia, it may be considered as fairly hardy  at least.      CALYCANTHUS.    CALYCANTHUS FLORIDUS.--Carolina Allspice. Carolina, 1726. If only  for the purplish-red, pleasantly-scented flowers, this North American  shrub is worthy of extensive culture. The hardiness, accommodating  nature, and delicious perfume of its brightly-coloured flowers render  this shrub one of the choicest subjects for the shrubbery or edges  of the woodland path. It is of easy though compact growth, reaching  in favourable situations a height of 12 feet, and with ovate leaves  that are slightly pubescent. Growing best in good fairly moist loam,  where partial shade is afforded, the sides of woodland drives and  paths will suit this Allspice well; but it wants plenty of room for  branch-development. There are several nursery forms of this shrub,  such as C. floridus glaucus, C. floridus asplenifolia, and C. floridus  nanus, all probably distinct enough, but of no superior ornamental  value to the parent plant.    C. OCCIDENTALIS.--Californian or Western Allspice. California, 1831.  This is larger in all its parts than the former, and for decorative  purposes is even preferable to that species. The flowers are dark  crimson, and nearly twice as large as those of C. floridus, but rather  more sparsely produced. This is a very distinct and desirable species,  and one that can be recommended for lawn and park planting, but, like  the former, it delights to grow in a rather moist and shady situation.      CARAGANA.    CARAGANA ARBORESCENS.--Siberian Pea Tree. Siberia, 1752. On account  of its great hardihood, this is a very desirable garden shrub or  small-growing tree. The bright-yellow, pea-shaped flowers are very  attractive, while the deep-green, pinnate foliage imparts to the tree a  somewhat unusual but taking appearance. Soil would not seem to be of  much moment in the cultivation of this, as, indeed, the other species  of Caragana, for it thrives well either on dry, sunny banks, where the  soil is light and thin, or in good stiff, yellow loam.    C. FRUTESCENS.--Siberia, 1852. Flowers in May, and is of partially  upright habit; while C. Chamlagii, from China, has greenish-yellow  flowers, faintly tinted with pinky-purple.    C. MICROPHYLLA (_syn C. Altagana_), also from Siberia, is smaller of  growth than the foregoing, but the flowers are individually larger. It  is readily distinguished by the more numerous and hairy leaflets and  thorny nature.    C. SPINOSA.--Siberia, 1775. This, as the name indicates, is of spiny  growth, and is a beautiful and distinct member of the family. They are  all hardy, and readily propagated from seed.      CARDIANDRA.    CARDIANDRA ALTERNIFOLIA.--Japan, 1866. With its neat habit, and pretty  purple-and-white, plentifully-produced flowers, this is worthy of the  small amount of care and coddling required"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"of hers. Foscolo is of opinion  that the tradition itself arose simply from a rhetorical flourish of  Boccaccio's, in his Life of Dante, against the marriages of men of  letters; though Boccaccio himself expressly adds, that he knows nothing  to the disadvantage of the poet's wife, except that her husband, after  quitting Florence, would never either come where she was, or suffer  her to come to him, mother as she was by him of so many children;--a  statement, it must be confessed, not a little encouraging to the  tradition.[12] Be this as it may, Dante married in his twenty-sixth  year; wrote an adoring account of his first love (the _Vita Nuova_) in  his twenty-eighth; and among the six children which Gemma brought him,  had a daughter whom he named Beatrice, in honour, it is understood, of  the fair Portinari; which surely was either a very great compliment, or  no mean trial to the temper of the mother.    We shall see presently how their domestic intercourse was interrupted,  and what absolute uncertainty there is respecting it, except as far as  conclusions may be drawn from his own temper and history.    Italy, in those days, was divided into the parties of Guelphs and  Ghibellines; the former, the advocates of general church-ascendancy  and local government; the latter, of the pretensions of the Emperor of  Germany, who claimed to be the Roman Caesar, and paramount over the  Pope. In Florence, the Guelphs had for a long time been so triumphant as  to keep the Ghibellines in a state of banishment. Dante was born and  bred a Guelph: he had twice borne arms for his country against Ghibelline  neighbours; and now, at the age of thirty-five, in the ninth of his  marriage, and last of his residence with his wife, he was appointed chief  of the temporary administrators of affairs, called Priors;--functionaries  who held office only for two months.    Unfortunately, at that moment, his party had become subdivided into the  factions of the Whites and Blacks, or adherents of two different sides  in a dispute that took place in Pistoia. The consequences becoming  serious, the Blacks proposed to bring in, as mediator, the French  Prince, Charles of Valois, then in arms for the Pope against the  Emperor; but the Whites, of whom Dante was one, were hostile to the  measure; and in order to prevent it, he and his brother magistrates  expelled for a time the heads of both factions, to the satisfaction of  neither. The Whites accused them of secretly leaning to the Ghibellines,  and the Blacks of openly favouring the Whites; who being, indeed,  allowed to come back before their time, on the alleged ground of the  unwholesomeness of their place of exile, which was fatal to Dante's  friend Cavalcante, gave a colour to the charge. Dante answered it by  saying, that he had then quitted office; but he could not shew that he  had lost his influence. Meantime, Charles was still urged to interfere,  and Dante was sent ambassador to the Pope to obtain his disapprobation  of the interference; but the Pope (Boniface the Eighth), who had  probably discovered that the Whites had ceased to care for any thing but  their own disputes, and who, at all events, did not like their objection  to his representative, beguiled the ambassador and encouraged the French  prince; the Blacks, in consequence, regained their ascendancy; and  the luckless poet, during his absence, was denounced as a corrupt  administrator of affairs, guilty of peculation; was severely  mulcted; banished from Tuscany for two years; and subsequently, for  contumaciousness, was sentenced to be _burnt alive_, in case he returned  ever. He never did return.    From that day forth, Dante never beheld again his home or his wife. Her  relations obtained possession of power, but no use was made of it except  to keep him in exile. He had not accorded with them; and perhaps half  the secret of his conjugal discomfort was owing to politics. It is the  opinion of some, that the married couple were not sorry to part; others  think that the wife remained behind, solely to scrape together what  property she could, and bring up the children. All that is known is,  that she never lived with him more.    Dante now certainly did what his enemies had accused him of wishing to  do: he joined the old exiles whom he had helped to make such, the party  of the Ghibellines. He alleges, that he never was really of any party  but his own; a naive confession, probably true in one sense, considering  his scorn of other people, his great intellectual superiority, and the  large views he had for the whole Italian people. And, indeed, he soon  quarrelled in private with the individuals composing his new party,  however stanch he apparently remained to their cause. His former  associates he had learnt to hate for their differences with him and for  their self-seeking; he hated the Pope for deceiving him; he hated  the Pope's French allies for being his allies, and interfering with  Florence; and he had come to love the Emperor for being hated by them  all, and for holding out (as he fancied) the only chance of reuniting  Italy to their confusion, and making her the restorer of himself, and  the mistress of the world.    With these feelings in his heart, no money in his purse, and no place in  which to lay his head, except such as chance-patrons afforded him,  he now began to wander over Italy, like some lonely lion of a man,  \"grudging in his great disdain.\" At one moment he was conspiring and  hoping; at another, despairing and endeavouring to conciliate his  beautiful Florence: now again catching hope from some new movement of  the Emperor's; and then, not very handsomely threatening and re-abusing  her; but always pondering and grieving, or trying to appease his  thoughts with some composition, chiefly of his great work. It is  conjectured, that whenever anything particularly affected him, whether  with joy or sorrow, he put it, hot with the impression, into his  \"sacred poem.\" Every body who jarred against his sense of right or his  prejudices he sent to the infernal regions, friend or foe: the strangest  people who sided with them (but certainly no personal foe) he exalted  to heaven. He encouraged, if not personally assisted, two ineffectual  attempts of the Ghibellines against Florence; wrote, besides his great  work, a book of mixed prose and poetry on \"Love and Virtue\" (the  _Convito_, or Banquet); a Latin treatise on Monarchy (_de Monarchia_),  recommending the \"divine right\" of the Emperor; another in two parts,  and in the same language, on the Vernacular Tongue (_de Vulgari  Eloquio_); and learnt to know meanwhile, as he affectingly tells us,  \"how hard it was to climb other people's stairs, and how salt the taste  of bread is that is not our own.\" It is even thought not improbable,  from one awful passage of his poem, that he may have \"placed himself in  some public way,\" and, \"stripping his visage of all shame, and trembling  in his very vitals,\" have stretched out his hand \"for charity\" [13]--an  image of suffering, which, proud as he was, yet considering how great a  man, is almost enough to make one's common nature stoop down for pardon  at his feet; and yet he should first prostrate himself at the feet of  that nature for his outrages on God and man. Several of the princes and  feudal chieftains of Italy entertained the poet for a while in their  houses; but genius and worldly power, unless for worldly purposes, find  it difficult to accord, especially in tempers like his. There must be  great wisdom and amiableness on both sides to save them from jealousy  of one another's pretensions. Dante was not the man to give and take in  such matters on equal terms; and hence he is at one time in a palace,  and at another in a solitude. Now he is in Sienna, now in Arezzo, now in  Bologna; then probably in Verona with Can Grande's elder brother; then  (if we are to believe those who have tracked his steps) in Casentino;  then with the Marchese Moroello Malaspina in Lunigiana; then with the  great Ghibelline chieftain Faggiuola in the mountains near Urbino; then  in Romagna, in Padua, in _Paris_ (arguing with the churchmen), some say  in Germany, and at _Oxford_; then again in Italy; in Lucca (where he is  supposed to have relapsed from his fidelity to Beatrice in favour of  a certain \"Gentucca\"); then again in Verona with the new prince, the  famous Can Grande (where his sarcasms appear to have lost him a doubtful  hospitality); then in a monastery in the mountains of Umbria; in Udine;  in Ravenna; and there at length he put up for the rest of his life with  his last and best friend, Guido Novello da Polenta, not the father, but  the nephew of the hapless Francesca.    It was probably in the middle period of his exile, that in one of the  moments of his greatest longing for his native country, he wrote that  affecting passage in the _Convito_, which was evidently a direct effort  at conciliation. Excusing himself for some harshness and obscurity in  the style of that work, he exclaims, \"Ah! would it had pleased the  Dispenser of all things that this excuse had never been needed;  that neither others had done me wrong, nor myself undergone penalty  undeservedly--the penalty, I say, of exile and of poverty. For it  pleased the citizens of the fairest and most renowned daughter of  Rome--Florence--to cast me out of her most sweet bosom, where I was  born, and bred, and passed half of the life of man, and in which, with  her good leave, I still desire with all my heart to repose my weary  spirit, and finish the days allotted me; and so I have wandered in  almost every place to which our language extends, a stranger, almost a  beggar, exposing against my will the wounds given me by fortune, too  often unjustly imputed to the sufferer's fault. Truly I have been a  vessel without sail and without rudder, driven about upon different  ports and shores by the dry wind that springs out of"]]]
