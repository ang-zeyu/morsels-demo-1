It is the place of the lady to bow first, if she meets a gentleman  of her acquaintance. When you meet friends or acquaintances in the  streets, the exhibitions, or any public places, be careful not  to pronounce their names so loudly as to attract the attention of  bystanders. Never call across the street, or attempt to carry on a  dialogue in a public vehicle, unless your interlocutor occupies the  seat beside your own.           *       *       *       *       *    VII.--DRESS.      To dress well requires something more than a full purse and a pretty  figure. It needs taste, good sense, and refinement. Dress may almost  be classed as one of the fine arts. It is certainly one of those arts,  the cultivation of which is indispensable to any person moving in  the upper or middle classes of society. Very clever women are too  frequently indifferent to the graces of the toilette; and women who  wish to be thought clever affect indifference. In the one case it  is an error, and in the other a folly. It is not enough that a  gentlewoman should be clever, or well-educated, or well-born. To take  her due place in society, she must be acquainted with all that this  little book proposes to teach. She must, above all else, know how to  enter a room, how to perform a graceful salutation, and how to dress.  Of these three important qualifications, the most important, because  the most observed, is the latter.    Let your style of dress always be appropriate to the hour of the day.  To dress too finely in the morning, or to be seen in a morning dress  in the evening, is equally vulgar and out of place.    Light and inexpensive materials are fittest for morning wear; dark  silk dresses for the promenade or carriage; and low dresses of rich or  transparent stuffs for the dinner and ball. A young lady cannot dress  with too much simplicity in the early part of the day. A morning dress  of some simple material, and delicate whole colour, with collar and  cuffs of spotless linen, is, perhaps, the most becoming and elegant of  morning toilettes.    Never dress very richly or showily in the street. It attracts  attention of no enviable kind, and is looked upon as a want of  good breeding. In the carriage a lady may dress as elegantly as she  pleases. With respect to ball-room toilette, its fashions are so  variable, that statements which are true of it to-day, may be false  a month hence. Respecting no institution of modern society is it so  difficult to pronounce half-a-dozen permanent rules.    We may, perhaps, be permitted to suggest the following leading  principles; but we do so with diffidence. Rich colours harmonize with  rich brunette complexions and dark hair. Delicate colours are the most  suitable for delicate and fragile styles of beauty. Very young ladies  are never so suitably attired as in white. Ladies who dance should  wear dresses of light and diaphanous materials, such as _tulle_,  gauze, crape, net, &c., over coloured silk slips. Silk dresses are not  suitable for dancing. A married lady who dances only a few quadrilles  may wear a _decollete_ silk dress with propriety.    Very stout persons should never wear white. It has the effect of  adding to the bulk of the figure.    Black and scarlet, or black and violet, are worn in mourning.    A lady in deep mourning should not dance at all.    However fashionable it may be to wear very long dresses, those ladies  who go to a ball with the intention of dancing and enjoying the  dance, should cause their dresses to be made short enough to clear  the ground. We would ask them whether it is not better to accept this  slight deviation from an absurd fashion, than to appear for three  parts of the evening in a torn and pinned-up skirt?    Well-made shoes, whatever their colour or material, and faultless  gloves, are indispensable to the effect of a ball-room toilette.    Much jewellery is out of place in a ball-room. Beautiful flowers,  whether natural or artificial, are the loveliest ornaments that a lady  can wear on these occasions.    At small dinner parties, low dresses are not so indispensable as  they were held to be some years since. High dresses of transparent  materials, and low bodices with capes of black lace, are considered  sufficiently full dress on these occasions. At large dinners only the  fullest dress is appropriate.    Very young ladies should wear but little jewellery. Pearls are deemed  most appropriate for the young and unmarried.    Let your jewellery be always the best of its kind. Nothing is so  vulgar, either in youth or age, as the use of false ornaments.    There is as much propriety to be observed in the wearing of jewellery  as in the wearing of dresses. Diamonds, pearls, rubies, and all  transparent precious stones belong to evening dress, and should on no  account be worn before dinner. In the morning let your rings be of  the more simple and massive kind; wear no bracelets; and limit your  jewellery to a good brooch, gold chain, and watch. Your diamonds  and pearls would be as much out of place during the morning as a low  dress, or a wreath.    It is well to remember in the choice of jewellery that mere costliness  is not always the test of value; and that an exquisite work of art,  such as a fine cameo, or a natural rarity, such as a black pearl, is a  more _distingue_ possession than a large brilliant which any rich and  tasteless vulgarian can buy as easily as yourself. Of all precious  stones, the opal is one of the most lovely and least commonplace. No  vulgar woman purchases an opal. She invariably prefers the more showy  ruby, emerald, or sapphire.    A true gentlewoman is always faultlessly neat. No richness of toilette  in the afternoon, no diamonds in the evening, can atone for unbrushed  hair, a soiled collar, or untidy slippers at breakfast.    Never be seen in the street without gloves; and never let your gloves  be of any material that is not kid or calf. Worsted or cotton gloves  are unutterably vulgar. Your gloves should fit to the last degree of  perfection.    In these days of public baths and universal progress, we trust that  it is unnecessary to do more than hint at the necessity of the most  fastidious personal cleanliness. The hair, the teeth, the nails,  should be faultlessly kept; and a muslin dress that has been worn  once too often, a dingy pocket-handkerchief, or a soiled pair of light  gloves, are things to be scrupulously avoided by any young lady who is  ambitious of preserving the exterior of a gentlewoman.    Remember that the make of your _corsage_ is of even greater importance  than the make of your dress. No dressmaker can fit you well, or  make your bodices in the manner most becoming to your figure, if the  _corsage_ beneath be not of the best description.    Your boots and gloves should always be faultless.    Perfumes should be used only in the evening, and then in moderation.  Let your perfumes be of the most delicate and _recherche_ kind.  Nothing is more vulgar than a coarse ordinary scent; and of all  coarse, ordinary scents, the most objectionable are musk and  patchouli.    Finally, every lady should remember that to dress well is a duty  which she owes to society; but that to make it her idol is to commit  something worse than a folly. Fashion is made for woman; not woman for  fashion.           *       *       *       *       *    VIII.--MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES.      The morning party is a modern invention. It was unknown to our fathers  and mothers, and even to ourselves till quite lately. A morning party  is seldom given out of the season--that is to say, during any months  except those of May, June, and July. It begins about two o'clock and  ends about five, and the entertainment consists for the most part  of conversation, music, and (if there be a garden) croquet, lawn  billiards, archery, &c. \"Aunt Sally\" is now out of fashion. The  refreshments are given in the form of a _dejeuner a la fourchette_.    Elegant morning dress, general good manners, and some acquaintance  with the topics of the day and the games above named, are all the  qualifications especially necessary to a lady at a morning party.    An evening party begins about nine o'clock p.m., and ends about  midnight, or somewhat later. Good breeding neither demands that you  should present yourself at the commencement, nor remain till the close  of the evening. You come and go as may be most convenient to you, and  by these means are at liberty, during the height of the season when  evening parties are numerous, to present yourself at two or three  houses during a single evening.    When your name is announced, look for the lady of the house, and pay  your respects to her before you even seem to see any other of  your friends who may be in the room. At very large and fashionable  receptions, the hostess is generally to be found near the door. Should  you, however, find yourself separated by a dense crowd of guests, you  are at liberty to recognize those who are near you, and those whom you  encounter as you make your way slowly through the throng.    General salutations of the company are now wholly disused. In society  a lady only recognizes her own friends and acquaintances.    If you are at the house of a new acquaintance and find yourself among  entire strangers, remember that by so meeting under one roof you  are all in a certain sense made known to one another, and should,  therefore, converse freely, as equals. To shrink away to a side-table  and affect to be absorbed in some album or illustrated work; or, if  you find one unlucky acquaintance in the room, to fasten upon her like  a drowning man clinging to a spar, are _gaucheries_ which no shyness  can excuse.    If you possess any musical accomplishments, do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12428"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#4)"],[1,"position, that the abolition of it ought to be  accounted by us as one of the greatest blessings, and that it ought to be  one of the most copious sources of our joy. Indeed I do not know, how we  can sufficiently express what we ought to feel upon this occasion. It  becomes us as individuals to rejoice. It becomes us as a nation to rejoice.  It becomes us even to perpetuate our joy to our posterity. I do not mean  however by anniversaries, which are to be celebrated by the ringing of  bells and convivial meetings, but by handing down this great event so  impressively to our children, as to raise in them, if not continual, yet  frequently renewed thanksgivings, to the great Creator of the universe, for  the manifestation of this his favour, in having disposed our legislators to  take away such a portion of suffering from our fellow-creatures, and such a  load of guilt from our native land.    And as the contemplation of the removal of this monstrous evil should  excite in us the most pleasing and grateful sensations, so the perusal of  the history of it should afford us lessons, which it must be useful to us  to know or to be reminded of. For it cannot be otherwise than useful to us  to know the means which have been used, and the different persons who have  moved, in so great a cause. It cannot be otherwise than useful to us to be  impressively reminded of the simple axiom, which the perusal of this  history will particularly suggest to us, that \"the greatest works must have  a beginning;\" because the fostering of such an idea in our minds cannot but  encourage us to undertake the removal of evils, however vast they may  appear in their size, or however difficult to overcome. It cannot again be  otherwise than useful to us to be assured (and this history will assure us  of it) that in any work, which is a work of righteousness, however small  the beginning may be, or however small the progress may be that we may make  in it, we ought never to despair; for that, whatever checks and  discouragements we may meet with, \"no virtuous effort is ever ultimately  lost.\" And finally, it cannot be otherwise than useful to us to form the  opinion, which the contemplation of this subject must always produce,  namely, that many of the evils, which are still left among us, may, by an  union of wise and virtuous individuals, be greatly alleviated, if not  entirely done away: for if the great evil of the Slave-trade, so deeply  entrenched by its hundred interests, has fallen prostrate before the  efforts of those who attacked it, what evil of a less magnitude shall not  be more easily subdued? O may reflections of this sort always enliven us,  always encourage us, always stimulate us to our duty! May we never cease to  believe, that many of the miseries of life are still to be remedied, or to  rejoice that we may be permitted, if we will only make ourselves worthy by  our endeavours, to heal them! May we encourage for this purpose every  generous sympathy that arises in our hearts, as the offspring of the Divine  influence for our good, convinced that we are not born for ourselves alone,  and that the Divinity never so fully dwells in us, as when we do his will;  and that we never do his will more agreeably, as far as it has been  revealed to us, than when we employ our time in works of charity towards  the rest of our fellow-creatures!          CHAPTER II.    _As it is desirable to know the true sources of events in history, so this  will be realized in that of the abolition of the Slave-trade--Inquiry as to  those who favoured the cause of the Africans previously to the year  1787--All these to be considered as necessary forerunners in that  cause--First forerunners were Cardinal Ximenes--the Emperor Charles the  Fifth--Pope Leo the Tenth--Elizabeth queen of England--Louis the Thirteenth  of France._      It would be considered by many, who have stood at the mouth of a river, and  witnessed its torrent there, to be both an interesting and a pleasing  journey to go to the fountain-head, and then to travel on its banks  downwards, and to mark the different streams in each side, which should run  into it and feed it. So I presume the reader will not be a little  interested and entertained in viewing with me the course of the abolition  of the Slave-trade, in first finding its source, and then in tracing the  different springs which have contributed to its increase. And here I may  observe that, in doing this, we shall have advantages, which historians  have not always had in developing the causes of things. Many have handed  down to us events, for the production of which they have given us but their  own conjectures. There has been often indeed such a distance between the  events themselves and the lives of those who have recorded them, that the  different means and motives belonging to them have been lost through time.  On the present occasion, however, we shall have the peculiar satisfaction  of knowing that we communicate the truth, or that those, which we unfold,  are the true causes and means. For the most remote of all the human  springs, which can be traced as having any bearing upon the great event in  question, will fall within the period of three centuries, and the most  powerful of them within the last twenty years. These circumstances indeed  have had their share in inducing me to engage in the present history. Had I  measured it by the importance of the subject, I had been deterred: but  believing that most readers love the truth, and that it ought to be the  object of all writers to promote it, and believing moreover, that I was in  possession of more facts on this subject than any other person, I thought I  was peculiarly called upon to undertake it.    In tracing the different streams from whence the torrent arose, which has  now happily swept away the Slave-trade, I must begin with an inquiry as to  those who favoured the cause of the injured Africans from the year 1516 to  the year 1787, at which latter period a number of persons associated  themselves in England for its abolition. For though they, who belonged to  this association, may, in consequence of having pursued a regular system,  be called the principal actors, yet it must be acknowledged that their  efforts would never have been so effectual, if the minds of men had not  been prepared by others, who had moved before them. Great events have never  taken place without previously disposing causes. So it is in the case  before us. Hence they, who lived even in early times, and favoured this  great cause, may be said to have been necessary precursors in it. And here  it may be proper to observe, that it is by no means necessary that all  these should have been themselves actors in the production of this great  event. Persons have contributed towards it in different ways:--Some have  written expressly on the subject, who have had no opportunity of promoting  it by personal exertions. Others have only mentioned it incidentally in  their writings. Others, in an elevated rank and station, have cried out  publicly concerning it, whose sayings have been recorded. All these,  however, may be considered as necessary forerunners in their day. For all  of them have brought the subject more or less into notice. They have more  or less enlightened the mind upon it. They have more or less impressed it.  And therefore each may be said to have had his share in diffusing and  keeping up a certain portion of knowledge, and feeling concerning it, which  has been eminently useful in the promotion of the cause.    It is rather remarkable, that the first forerunners and coadjutors should  have been men in power.    So early as in the year 1503 a few slaves had been sent from the Portuguese  settlements in Africa into the Spanish colonies in America. In 1511,  Ferdinand the Fifth, king of Spain, permitted them to be carried in greater  numbers. Ferdinand, however, must have been ignorant in these early times  of the piratical manner in which the Portuguese had procured them. He could  have known nothing of their treatment when in bondage, nor could he have  viewed the few uncertain adventurous transportations of them into his  dominions in the western world, in the light of a regular trade. After his  death, however, a proposal was made by Bartholomew de las Casas, the bishop  of Chiapa, to Cardinal Ximenes, who held the reins of the government of  Spain till Charles the Fifth came to the throne, for the establishment of a  regular system of commerce in the persons of the native Africans. The  object of Bartholomew de las Casas was undoubtedly to save the American  Indians, whose cruel treatment and almost extirpation he had witnessed  during his residence among them, and in whose behalf he had undertaken a  voyage to the court of Spain. It is difficult to reconcile this proposal  with the humane and charitable spirit of the bishop of Chiapa. But it is  probable he believed that a code of laws would soon be established in  favour both of Africans and of the natives in the Spanish settlements, and  that he flattered himself that, being about to return and to live in the  country of their slavery, he could look to the execution of it. The  cardinal, however, with a foresight, a benevolence, and a justice, which  will always do honour to his memory, refused the proposal, not only judging  it to be unlawful to consign innocent people to slavery at all, but to be  very inconsistent to deliver the inhabitants of one country from a state of  misery by consigning to it those of another. Ximenes therefore may be  considered as one of the first great friends of the Africans after the  partial beginning of the trade.    This answer of the cardinal, as it showed his virtue as an individual, so  it was peculiarly honourable to him as a public man, and ought to operate  as a lesson to other statesmen, how they admit any thing new among  political regulations and establishments, which"]]]
