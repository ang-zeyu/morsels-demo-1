[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#3)"],[1,"  \"Is blue the only respectable color, then?\" inquired Ojo.    \"Yes, for a Munchkin. All our country is blue, you know. But in other  parts of Oz the people favor different colors. At the Emerald City,  where our Princess Ozma lives, green is the popular color. But all  Munchkins prefer blue to anything else and when my housework girl is  brought to life she will find herself to be of so many unpopular colors  that she'll never dare be rebellious or impudent, as servants are  sometimes liable to be when they are made the same way their mistresses  are.\"    Unc Nunkie nodded approval.    \"Good i-dea,\" he said; and that was a long speech for Unc Nunkie  because it was two words.    \"So I cut up the quilt,\" continued Margolotte, \"and made from it a very  well-shaped girl, which I stuffed with cotton-wadding. I will show you  what a good job I did,\" and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open  the doors.    Then back she came, lugging in her arms the Patchwork Girl, which she  set upon the bench and propped up so that the figure would not tumble  over.          Chapter Three    The Patchwork Girl      Ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder. The Patchwork Girl  was taller than he, when she stood upright, and her body was plump and  rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton. Margolotte  had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she  had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in  it--using the same gay material throughout. Upon the feet she had sewn  a pair of red leather shoes with pointed toes. All the fingers and  thumbs of the girl's hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and  stitched at the edges, with gold plates at the ends to serve as  finger-nails.    \"She will have to work, when she comes to life,\" said Margolotte.    The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her. While  she waited for her husband to finish making his Powder of Life the  woman had found ample time to complete the head as her fancy dictated,  and she realized that a good servant's head must be properly  constructed. The hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in  several neat braids. Her eyes were two silver suspender-buttons cut  from a pair of the Magician's old trousers, and they were sewed on with  black threads, which formed the pupils of the eyes. Margolotte had  puzzled over the ears for some time, for these were important if the  servant was to hear distinctly, but finally she had made them out of  thin plates of gold and attached them in place by means of stitches  through tiny holes bored in the metal. Gold is the most common metal in  the Land of Oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and  pliable.    The woman had cut a slit for the Patchwork Girl's mouth and sewn two  rows of white pearls in it for teeth, using a strip of scarlet plush  for a tongue. This mouth Ojo considered very artistic and lifelike, and  Margolotte was pleased when the boy praised it. There were almost too  many patches on the face of the girl for her to be considered strictly  beautiful, for one cheek was yellow and the other red, her chin blue,  her forehead purple and the center, where her nose had been formed and  padded, a bright yellow.    \"You ought to have had her face all pink,\" suggested the boy.    \"I suppose so; but I had no pink cloth,\" replied the woman. \"Still, I  cannot see as it matters much, for I wish my Patchwork Girl to be  useful rather than ornamental. If I get tired looking at her patched  face I can whitewash it.\"    \"Has she any brains?\" asked Ojo.    \"No; I forgot all about the brains!\" exclaimed the woman. \"I am glad  you reminded me of them, for it is not too late to supply them, by any  means. Until she is brought to life I can do anything I please with  this girl. But I must be careful not to give her too much brains, and  those she has must be such as are fitted to the station she is to  occupy in life. In other words, her brains mustn't be very good.\"    \"Wrong,\" said Unc Nunkie.    \"No; I am sure I am right about that,\" returned the woman.    \"He means,\" explained Ojo, \"that unless your servant has good brains  she won't know how to obey you properly, nor do the things you ask her  to do.\"    \"Well, that may be true,\" agreed Margolotte; \"but, on the contrary, a  servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and  high-and-mighty and feel above her work. This is a very delicate task,  as I said, and I must take care to give the girl just the right  quantity of the right sort of brains. I want her to know just enough,  but not too much.\"    With this she went to another cupboard which was filled with shelves.  All the shelves were lined with blue glass bottles, neatly labeled by  the Magician to show what they contained. One whole shelf was marked:  \"Brain Furniture,\" and the bottles on this shelf were labeled as  follows: \"Obedience,\" \"Cleverness,\" \"Judgment,\" \"Courage,\" \"Ingenuity,\"  \"Amiability,\" \"Learning,\" \"Truth,\" \"Poesy,\" \"Self Reliance.\"    \"Let me see,\" said Margolotte; \"of those qualities she must have  'Obedience' first of all,\" and she took down the bottle bearing that  label and poured from it upon a dish several grains of the contents.  \"'Amiability' is also good and 'Truth.'\" She poured into the dish a  quantity from each of these bottles. \"I think that will do,\" she  continued, \"for the other qualities are not needed in a servant.\"    Unc Nunkie, who with Ojo stood beside her, touched the bottle marked  \"Cleverness.\"    \"Little,\" said he.    \"A little 'Cleverness'? Well, perhaps you are right, sir,\" said she,  and was about to take down the bottle when the Crooked Magician  suddenly called to her excitedly from the fireplace.    \"Quick, Margolotte! Come and help me.\"    She ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four  kettles from the fire. Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in  the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder. Very  carefully the Magician removed this powder, placing it all together in  a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon. When the mixture  was complete there was scarcely a handful, all told.    \"That,\" said Dr. Pipt, in a pleased and triumphant tone, \"is the  wonderful Powder of Life, which I alone in the world know how to make.  It has taken me nearly six years to prepare these precious grains of  dust, but the little heap on that dish is worth the price of a kingdom  and many a king would give all he has to possess it. When it has become  cooled I will place it in a small bottle; but meantime I must watch it  carefully, lest a gust of wind blow it away or scatter it.\"    Unc Nunkie, Margolotte and the Magician all stood looking at the  marvelous Powder, but Ojo was more interested just then in the  Patchwork Girl's brains. Thinking it both unfair and unkind to deprive  her of any good qualities that were handy, the boy took down every  bottle on the shelf and poured some of the contents in Margolotte's  dish. No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of  Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came  back to the cupboard.    \"Let's see,\" she remarked; \"I was about to give my girl a little  'Cleverness,' which is the Doctor's substitute for 'Intelligence'--a  quality he has not yet learned how to manufacture.\" Taking down the  bottle of \"Cleverness\" she added some of the powder to the heap on the  dish. Ojo became a bit uneasy at this, for he had already put quite a  lot of the \"Cleverness\" powder in the dish; but he dared not interfere  and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too  much cleverness.    Margolotte now carried the dish of brains to the bench. Ripping the  seam of the patch on the girl's forehead, she placed the powder within  the head and then sewed up the seam as neatly and securely as before.    \"My girl is all ready for your Powder of Life, my dear,\" she said to  her husband. But the Magician replied:    \"This powder must not be used before to-morrow morning; but I think it  is now cool enough to be bottled.\"    He selected a small gold bottle with a pepper-box top, so that the  powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes. Very  carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then  locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.    \"At last,\" said he, rubbing his hands together gleefully, \"I have ample  leisure for a good talk with my old friend Unc Nunkie. So let us sit  down cosily and enjoy ourselves. After stirring those four kettles for  six years I am glad to have a little rest.\"    \"You will have to do most of the talking,\" said Ojo, \"for Unc is called  the Silent One and uses few words.\"    \"I know; but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and  gossip,\" declared Dr. Pipt. \"Most people talk too much, so it is a  relief to find one who talks too little.\"    Ojo looked at the Magician with much awe and curiosity.    \"Don't you find it very annoying to be so crooked?\" he asked.    \"No; I am quite proud of my person,\" was the reply. \"I suppose I am the  only Crooked Magician in all the world. Some others are accused of  being crooked, but I am the only genuine.\"    He was really very crooked and Ojo wondered how he managed to do so  many things with such a twisted body. When he sat down upon a crooked  chair that had been made to fit him, one knee was under his chin and  the other near the small of his back; but he was a cheerful man and his  face bore a pleasant and agreeable expression.    \"I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement,\" he  told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began  to smoke. \"Too many people were working magic in the Land of Oz, and so  our lovely Princess Ozma put a stop to it. I think she was quite right.  There were several wicked Witches who caused a lot of trouble; but now  they are all out of business and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#3)"],[1,"ever visited Oz, so it took them some time to  discover they were not in Oz at all, but in an unknown country.    \"Never mind,\" said Ann, trying to conceal her disappointment; \"we have  started out to conquer the world, and here is part of it. In time, as  we pursue our victorious journey, we will doubtless come to Oz; but,  until we get there, we may as well conquer whatever land we find  ourselves in.\"    \"Have we conquered this place, Your Majesty?\" anxiously inquired Major  Cake.    \"Most certainly,\" said Ann. \"We have met no people, as yet, but when we  do, we will inform them that they are our slaves.\"    \"And afterward we will plunder them of all their possessions,\" added  General Apple.    \"They may not possess anything,\" objected Private Files; \"but I hope  they will fight us, just the same. A peaceful conquest wouldn't be any  fun at all.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said the Queen. \"_We_ can fight, whether our foes do or  not; and perhaps we would find it more comfortable to have the enemy  surrender promptly.\"    It was a barren country and not very pleasant to travel in. Moreover,  there was little for them to eat, and as the officers became hungry  they became fretful. Many would have deserted had they been able to  find their way home, but as the Oogaboo people were now hopelessly lost  in a strange country they considered it more safe to keep together than  to separate.    Queen Ann's temper, never very agreeable, became sharp and irritable as  she and her army tramped over the rocky roads without encountering  either people or plunder. She scolded her officers until they became  surly, and a few of them were disloyal enough to ask her to hold her  tongue. Others began to reproach her for leading them into difficulties  and in the space of three unhappy days every man was mourning for his  orchard in the pretty valley of Oogaboo.    Files, however, proved a different sort. The more difficulties he  encountered the more cheerful he became, and the sighs of the officers  were answered by the merry whistle of the Private. His pleasant  disposition did much to encourage Queen Ann and before long she  consulted the Private Soldier more often than she did his superiors.    It was on the third day of their pilgrimage that they encountered their  first adventure. Toward evening the sky was suddenly darkened and Major  Nails exclaimed:    \"A fog is coming toward us.\"    \"I do not think it is a fog,\" replied Files, looking with interest at  the approaching cloud. \"It seems to me more like the breath of a Rak.\"    \"What is a Rak?\" asked Ann, looking about fearfully.    \"A terrible beast with a horrible appetite,\" answered the soldier,  growing a little paler than usual. \"I have never seen a Rak, to be  sure, but I have read of them in the story-books that grew in my  orchard, and if this is indeed one of those fearful monsters, we are  not likely to conquer the world.\"    Hearing this, the officers became quite worried and gathered closer  about their soldier.    \"What is the thing like?\" asked one.    \"The only picture of a Rak that I ever saw in a book was rather  blurred,\" said Files, \"because the book was not quite ripe when it was  picked. But the creature can fly in the air and run like a deer and  swim like a fish. Inside its body is a glowing furnace of fire, and the  Rak breathes in air and breathes out smoke, which darkens the sky for  miles around, wherever it goes. It is bigger than a hundred men and  feeds on any living thing.\"    The officers now began to groan and to tremble, but Files tried to  cheer them, saying:    \"It may not be a Rak, after all, that we see approaching us, and you  must not forget that we people of Oogaboo, which is part of the  fairyland of Oz, cannot be killed.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said Captain Buttons, \"if the Rak catches us, and chews  us up into small pieces, and swallows us--what will happen then?\"    \"Then each small piece will still be alive,\" declared Files.    \"I cannot see how that would help us,\" wailed Colonel Banjo. \"A  hamburger steak is a hamburger steak, whether it is alive or not!\"    \"I tell you, this may not be a Rak,\" persisted Files. \"We will know,  when the cloud gets nearer, whether it is the breath of a Rak or not.  If it has no smell at all, it is probably a fog; but if it has an odor  of salt and pepper, it is a Rak and we must prepare for a desperate  fight.\"    They all eyed the dark cloud fearfully. Before long it reached the  frightened group and began to envelop them. Every nose sniffed the  cloud--and every one detected in it the odor of salt and pepper.    \"The Rak!\" shouted Private Files, and with a howl of despair the  sixteen officers fell to the ground, writhing and moaning in anguish.  Queen Ann sat down upon a rock and faced the cloud more bravely,  although her heart was beating fast. As for Files, he calmly loaded his  gun and stood ready to fight the foe, as a soldier should.    They were now in absolute darkness, for the cloud which covered the sky  and the setting sun was black as ink. Then through the gloom appeared  two round, glowing balls of red, and Files at once decided these must  be the monster's eyes.    He raised his gun, took aim and fired.    There were several bullets in the gun, all gathered from an excellent  bullet-tree in Oogaboo, and they were big and hard. They flew toward  the monster and struck it, and with a wild, weird cry the Rak came  fluttering down and its huge body fell plump upon the forms of the  sixteen officers, who thereupon screamed louder than before.    \"Badness me!\" moaned the Rak. \"See what you've done with that dangerous  gun of yours!\"    \"I can't see,\" replied Files, \"for the cloud formed by your breath  darkens my sight!\"    \"Don't tell me it was an accident,\" continued the Rak, reproachfully,  as it still flapped its wings in a helpless manner. \"Don't claim you  didn't know the gun was loaded, I beg of you!\"    \"I don't intend to,\" replied Files. \"Did the bullets hurt you very  badly?\"    \"One has broken my jaw, so that I can't open my mouth. You will notice  that my voice sounds rather harsh and husky, because I have to talk  with my teeth set close together. Another bullet broke my left wing, so  that I can't fly; and still another broke my right leg, so that I can't  walk. It was the most careless shot I ever heard of!\"    \"Can't you manage to lift your body off from my commanding officers?\"  inquired Files. \"From their cries I'm afraid your great weight is  crushing them.\"    \"I hope it is,\" growled the Rak. \"I want to crush them, if possible,  for I have a bad disposition. If only I could open my mouth, I'd eat  all of you, although my appetite is poorly this warm weather.\"    With this the Rak began to roll its immense body sidewise, so as to  crush the officers more easily; but in doing this it rolled completely  off from them and the entire sixteen scrambled to their feet and made  off as fast as they could run.    Private Files could not see them go but he knew from the sound of their  voices that they had escaped, so he ceased to worry about them.    \"Pardon me if I now bid you good-bye,\" he said to the Rak. \"The parting  is caused by our desire to continue our journey. If you die, do not  blame me, for I was obliged to shoot you as a matter of  self-protection.\"    \"I shall not die,\" answered the monster, \"for I bear a charmed life.  But I beg you not to leave me!\"    \"Why not?\" asked Files.    \"Because my broken jaw will heal in about an hour, and then I shall be  able to eat you. My wing will heal in a day and my leg will heal in a  week, when I shall be as well as ever. Having shot me, and so caused me  all this annoyance, it is only fair and just that you remain here and  allow me to eat you as soon as I can open my jaws.\"    \"I beg to differ with you,\" returned the soldier firmly. \"I have made  an engagement with Queen Ann of Oogaboo to help her conquer the world,  and I cannot break my word for the sake of being eaten by a Rak.\"    \"Oh; that's different,\" said the monster. \"If you've an engagement,  don't let me detain you.\"    So Files felt around in the dark and grasped the hand of the trembling  Queen, whom he led away from the flapping, sighing Rak. They stumbled  over the stones for a way but presently began to see dimly the path  ahead of them, as they got farther and farther away from the dreadful  spot where the wounded monster lay. By and by they reached a little  hill and could see the last rays of the sun flooding a pretty valley  beyond, for now they had passed beyond the cloudy breath of the Rak.  Here were huddled the sixteen officers, still frightened and panting  from their run. They had halted only because it was impossible for them  to run any farther.    Queen Ann gave them a severe scolding for their cowardice, at the same  time praising Files for his courage.    \"We are wiser than he, however,\" muttered General Clock, \"for by  running away we are now able to assist Your Majesty in conquering the  world; whereas, had Files been eaten by the Rak, he would have deserted  your Army.\"    After a brief rest they descended into the valley, and as soon as they  were out of sight of the Rak the spirits of the entire party rose  quickly. Just at dusk they came to a brook, on the banks of which Queen  Ann commanded them to make camp for the night.    Each officer carried in his pocket a tiny white tent. This, when placed  upon the ground, quickly grew in size until it was large enough to  permit the owner to enter it and sleep within its canvas walls. Files  was obliged to carry a knapsack, in which was not only his own tent but  an elaborate pavilion for Queen Ann, besides a bed and chair and a  magic table. This table, when set upon the ground in Ann's pavilion,  became of large size, and in a drawer of the table was contained the  Queen's supply of extra clothing, her manicure and toilet articles and  other necessary things. The royal bed was the only one in"]]]
