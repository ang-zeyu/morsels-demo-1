The church of Rome, in the height of its power, was extremely  scrupulous in all that related to the sacramental bread. According  to Steevens, in his _Monasticon_, they first chose the wheat,  grain by grain, and washed it very carefully. Being put into a bag,  appointed only for that use, a servant, known to be a just man,  carried it to the mill, worked the grindstones, covering them with  curtains above and below; and having put on himself an albe, covered  his face with a veil, nothing but his eyes appearing. The same  precaution was used with the meal. It was not baked till it had been  well washed; and the warden of the church, if he were either priest  or deacon, finished the work, being assisted by two other religious  men, who were in the same orders, and by a lay brother, particularly  appointed for that business. These four monks, when matins were  ended, washed their faces and hands. The three first of them put on  albes; one of them washed the meal with pure, clean water, and the  other two baked the hosts in the iron moulds. So great was the  veneration and respect, say their historians, the monks of Cluni  paid to the Eucharist! Even at this day, in the country, the baker  who prepares the sacramental wafer, must be appointed and authorized  to do it by the Catholic bishop of the district, as appears by the  advertisement inserted in that curious book, published annually,  _The Catholic Laity's Directory_.                     *       *       *       *       *          FOSTER CHILDREN.      There still remains in the Hebrides, though it is passing fast away,  the custom of fosterage. A laird, a man of wealth and eminence,  sends his child, either male or female, to a tacksman or tenant to  be fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but some distant  friend that obtains this honour; for an honour such a trust is very  reasonably thought. The terms of fosterage seem to vary in different  islands. In Mull, the father sends with his child a certain number  of cows, to which the same number is added by the fosterer. The  father appropriates a proportionable extent of ground, without rent,  for their pasturage. If every cow bring a calf, half belongs to the  fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be only one calf  between two cows, it is the child's; and when the child returns to  the parents, it is accompanied with all the cows given, both by the  father and by the fosterer, with half of the increase of the stock  by propagation. These beasts are considered as a portion, and called  _Macalive_ cattle, &c.    Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years; and cannot,  where this is the practice, be considered as burdensome. The  fosterer, if he gives four cows, receives likewise four, and has,  while the child continues with him, grass for eight without rent,  with half the calves, and all the milk, for which he pays only four  cows, when he dismisses his _dalt_, for that is the name for a  fostered child.--_Johnson's Journey_.                     *       *       *       *       *          THE IRISH PEOPLE.      Holinshed, speaking of the Irish, observes:--\"Greedy of praise they  be, and fearful of dishonour; and to this end they esteem their  poets, who write Irish learnedly, and pen their sonnets heroical,  for the which they are bountifully rewarded; if not, they send out  libels in dispraise, whereof the lords and gentlemen stand in great  awe. They love tenderly their foster children, and bequeath to them  a child's fortune, whereby they nourish sure friendship,--so  beneficent every way, that commonly 500 cows and better are given in  reward to win a nobleman's child to foster; they love and trust  their foster children more than their own. Proud they are of long  crisped bushes of hair, which they term _libs_. They observe  divers degrees, according to which each man is regarded. The basest  sort among them are little young wasps, called _daltins_: these  are lacqueys, and are serviceable to the grooms, or horseboys, who  are a degree above the daltins. The third degree is the  _kaerne_, which is an ordinary soldier, using for weapon his  sword and target, and sometimes his piece, being commonly so good  marksmen, as they will come within a score of a great cartele. The  fourth degree is a _gallowglass_, using a kind of poll-axe for  his weapon, strong, robust men, chiefly feeding on beef, pork, and  butter. The fifth degree is to be a horseman, which is the {40}  chiefest, next to the lord and captain. These horsemen, when they  have no stay of their own, gad and range from house to house, and  never dismount till they ride into the hall, and as far as the  tables.\"                     *       *       *       *       *      MARRIAGE.    The minister of Logierait, in Perthshire, in his statistical account  of that parish, supplies us with the following curious information  on this and other marriage ceremonies:--\"Immediately before the  celebration of the marriage ceremony, every knot about the bride and  bridegroom (garters, shoe-strings, strings of petticoats, &c.) is  carefully loosed. After leaving the church, the whole company walk  round it, keeping the church walls always upon the right hand; the  bridegroom, however, first retires one way, with some young men, to  tie the knots that were loosened about him, while the young married  woman, in the same manner, retires somewhere else to adjust the  disorder of her dress.\"                     *       *       *       *       *      NEEDFIRE.    The following extract contains a distinct and interesting account of  this very ancient superstition, as used in Caithness:    \"In 1788, when the stock of any considerable farmer was seized with  the murrain, he would send for one of the charm doctors to  superintend the raising of a _needfire_. It was done by  friction, thus: upon any small island, where the stream of a river  or burn ran on each side, a circular booth was erected, of stone and  turf, as it could be had, in which a semicircular or highland couple  of birch, or other hard wood, was set; and, in short, a roof closed  on it. A straight pole was set up in the centre of this building,  the upper end fixed by a wooden pin to the top of the couple, and  the lower end in an oblong _trink_ in the earth or floor; and  lastly, another pole was set across horizontally, having both ends  tapered, one end of which was supported in a hole in the side of the  perpendicular pole, and the other end in a similar hole in the  couple leg. The horizontal stick was called the auger, having four  short arms or levers fixed in its centre, to work it by; the  building having been thus finished, as many men as could be  collected in the vicinity, (being divested of all kinds of metal in  their clothes, &c.) would set to work with the said auger, two after  two, constantly turning it round by the arms or levers, and others  occasionally driving wedges of wood or stone behind the lower end of  the upright pole, so as to press it the more on the end of the  auger; by this constant friction and pressure, the ends of the auger  would take fire, from which a fire would be instantly kindled, and  thus the _needfire_ would be accomplished. The fire in the  farmer's house, &c. was immediately quenched with water, a fire  kindled from this _needfire_, both in the farm-house and  offices, and the cattle brought to feel the smoke of this new and  sacred fire, which preserved them from the murrain. So much for  superstition.--It is handed down by tradition, that the ancient  Druids superintended a similar ceremony of raising a sacred fire,  annually, on the first day of May. That day is still, both in the  Gaelic and Irish dialects, called _La-bealtin, i.e._ the day  of Baal's fire, or the fire dedicated to Baal, or the sun.\"                     *       *       *       *       *        UNSPOKEN WATER.    In Scotland, water from under a bridge, over which the living pass  and the dead are carried, brought in the dawn or twilight to the  house of a sick person, without the bearer's speaking, either in  going or returning, is called _Unspoken Water_.    The modes of application are various. Sometimes the invalid takes  three draughts of it before anything is spoken. Sometimes it is  thrown over the houses the vessel in which it was contained being  thrown after it. The superstitious believe this to be one of the  most powerful charms that can be employed for restoring a sick  person to health.    The purifying virtue attributed to water, by almost all nations, is  so well known as to require no illustration. Some special virtue has  still been ascribed to silence in the use of charms, exorcisms, &c.  I recollect, says Mr. Jamieson, being assured at Angus, that a  Popish priest in that part of the country, who was supposed to  possess great power in curing those who were deranged, and in  exorcising demoniacs, would, if called to see a patient, on no  account utter a single word on his way, or after arriving at the  house, till he had by himself gone through all his appropriate forms  in order to effect a cure. Whether this practice might be founded on  our Lord's injunction to the Seventy, expressive of the diligence he  required, Luke x. 4, \"Salute no man by the way,\" or borrowed from  heathen superstition, it is impossible to ascertain. We certainly  know that the Romans viewed silence as of the utmost importance in  their sacred rites. Hence the phrase of Virgil,---      \"Fida silentia sacris.\"    _Fauere sacris, fauere linguis_, and {41}_pascere  linguam_, were forms of speech appropriated to their sacred  rites, by which they enjoined silence, that the act of worship might  not be disturbed by the slightest noise or murmur. Hence also they  honoured Harpocrates as the god of silence; and Numa"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#4)"],[1,"iod, in which the influence of  Bruno and Spinoza is prominent, he works out his own philosophy of  identity; at this time he publishes _Bruno, or, Concerning the Natural  and Divine Principle of Things_, 1802, and _Method of Academic Study_,  1803. In the third period the philosophy of identity becomes the basis  for a still higher system in which the influence of German theosophy  (Jacob Boehme) is apparent; with the exception of _Philosophy and  Religion_, 1804, the _Treatise on Human Freedom_, 1809, and a  few others, the works of this period did not appear until after  Schelling's death. His previous philosophy is now called by him  \"negative philosophy;\" the higher or positive philosophy has as its  aim the rational construction of the history of the universe, or the  history of creation, upon the basis of the religious ideas of peoples;  it is a philosophy of mythology and revelation. Translations of some  of Schelling's works are to be found in the _Journal of Speculative  Philosophy_, an American periodical founded by W.T. Harris, which  devoted itself to the study of post-Kantian idealism. His Complete  Works, edited by his son, appeared in 14 volumes, 1856. There is a  revival of interest in his philosophy, and new editions of his books  are now being published.    Like most philosophers of note, Schelling reckons with the various  tendencies of his times. With idealism he interprets the universe as  identical in essence with what we find in our innermost selves; it is  at bottom a living dynamic process. If that is so, nature cannot be  a merely externalized obstacle for the ego, nor a dead static spatial  mechanical system; as the expression of an active spiritual principle  there must be reason and purpose in it. But reason is not identified  by Schelling with self-conscious intelligence, for with the  faith-philosophies and Romanticism he takes it in a wider sense; in  physical and organic nature it is a slumbering reason, an unconscious,  instinctive, purposive force similar to the Leibnizian monad,  Schopenhauer's will, and Bergson's _elan vital_. In this way the  dualism between mechanism and teleology is reconciled. Nature is  a teleological order, an evolution from the unconscious to the  conscious; in man, the highest stage and the climax of history, nature  becomes self-conscious. With this organic conception both Romanticists  and many natural scientists of the age were in practical agreement;  it was the view that had always appealed to Goethe--and Herder before  him--and it gained for Schelling a large following. In his earlier  system he regarded nature as a lower stage in the evolution of  reason and sought to answer the problems: How does Nature become  Consciousness or Ego? the problem of the Philosophy of Nature; and,  How does Consciousness or the Ego become Nature? the problem of  Transcendental Idealism. In his philosophy of identity, nature and  mind are conceived as two different aspects of one and the same  principle, which is both mind and nature, subject and object, ego and  non-ego. All things are identical in essence but differentiated in the  course of evolution. It was not inconsistent with these tenets that  Schelling sought, in his last period, to discover the meaning  of universal history in the obscure beginnings of mythology  and revelation rather than in the lucid regions of an advanced  civilization.    With the opponents of rationalism Schelling agrees that we cannot  reach the inner meaning of reality, \"the living, moving element  in nature,\" through the scientific intelligence, but that we must  envisage it in intuition. \"What is described in concepts,\" he tells  us, \"is at rest; hence there can be concepts only of _things_ and of  that which is finite and sense-perceived. The notion of movement is  not movement itself, and without intuition we should never know what  motion is. Freedom, however, can be comprehended only by freedom,  activity only by activity.\" Schelling, who is a poet as well as a  philosopher, comes to regard this intuition or inner vision as an  artistic intuition. In the products of art, subject and object, the  ideal and the real, mind and nature, form (or purpose) and matter,  are one; here the harmony aimed at by philosophy lies before our very  eyes, and may be seen, touched, and heard. The creative artist creates  like nature in realizing the ideal; hence, art must serve as the  absolute model for the intuition of the world--it is the true and  eternal organ of philosophy. Like the artistic genius, the philosopher  must have the faculty for perceiving the harmony and identity in the  universe; esthetic intuition is absolute knowing. Art aims to reveal  to us the profoundest meaning of the world, which is the union of form  and matter, of the ideal and the real; in art alone the striving of  nature for harmony and identity is realized; the beautiful is the  infinite represented and made perceivable in finite form; here mind  and nature interpenetrate. In creative art the artist imitates the  creative act of nature and becomes conscious of it; in esthetic  intuition, or the perception of beauty, the philosophical genius  discovers the secret of reality; nature herself is a poem and her  secret is revealed in art. This philosophy is a far cry from the  logical-mathematical method of the _Aufklaerung_; it is a protest  against this, a protest in which the leaders of the new German  literature, Herder, Goethe, Schiller, as well as the Romanticists,  willingly joined. Goethe's entire view of nature, art, and life rested  upon the teleological or organic conception; he, too, regarded the  ability to peer into the heart of things--to see the whole in its  parts, the ideal in the real, the universal in the particular, as  the poet's and thinker's highest gift. He called it an _apercu_, \"a  revelation springing up in the inner man that gives him a hint of  his likeness to God.\" It is this gift which Faust craves and Mephisto  sneers at as _die hohe Intuition_.      Dass ich erkenne was die Welt    Im innersten zusammenhaelt,    Schau alle Wirkungskraft and Samen    Und tu' nicht mehr in Worten kramen.    There was much that was fantastic in the _Naturphilosophie_ and much  _a priori_ interpretation of nature that tended to withdraw the  mind from the actualities of existence; it often dealt with bold  assertions, analogies, and figures of speech, rather than with facts  and proofs. But it had its merits; for it aroused an interest in  nature and nature-study, it kept alive the _philosophical_ interest  in the outer world, the desire for unity, _Einheitstrieb_, which has  remained a marked characteristic of German science from Alexander von  Humboldt down to Robert Mayer, Helmholtz, Naegeli, Haeckel, Ostwald,  Hertz, and Driesch. It opposed the one-sided mechanical method of  science, and emphasized conceptions (the idea of development,  the notion of the dynamic character of reality, pan-psychism, and  vitalism) which are still moving the minds of men today, as is  evidenced by the popularity of Henri Bergson, who, with our own  William James, leads the contemporary school of philosophical  Romanticists.    Fichte's chief contribution to German thought was the  _Wissenschaftslehre_, Schelling's the _Naturphilosophie_, and  Schleiermacher's the philosophy of religion. All these thinkers took  account of the prevailing tendencies of the times--_Aufklaerung_,  Kantian criticism, faith-philosophy, Romanticism, and Spinozism--and  were more or less affected by them. Schleiermacher also came under the  influence of Fichte, Schelling, and Greek idealism, particularly  of Plato's philosophy; many were the sources from which he drew his  material for the construction of a great system of Protestant theology  that exercised a profound influence far beyond the boundaries of his  country and won for him the title of the founder of the New Theology.    Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher, the son of a clergyman of  the reformed church, was born at Breslau, November 21, 1768, and was  educated at the Moravian schools at Niesky and Barby. Made sceptical  by the newer criticism, he left the Moravian brotherhood and entered  the University of Halle (1787), where he devoted himself with equal  zeal to the study of theology and philosophy. After his ordination  in 1794 he occupied various pulpits until 1803, when he was made a  professor and university preacher at Halle. In 1806 he removed from  Halle to Berlin, becoming the preacher of Trinity Church in 1809  and professor of theology at the newly founded University in 1810,  positions which he filled with marked ability until his death,  February 12, 1834. It was in Berlin that he came into friendly touch  with the leaders of the Romantic school, Tieck, Friedrich Schlegel,  and Novalis, but he did not allow himself to be carried away by their  extravagances. He distinguished himself as a preacher, theologian,  philosopher, and philologist, and, by his study of the sources of  philosophy, added much to the knowledge of its history. Among the  books published during his life-time are: _Addresses on Religion_,  1799; _Monologues_, 1800; _Principles of a Criticism of Previous  Systems of Ethics_, 1803; translations of Plato's _Dialogues_, with  introductions and notes, 1804-28; _The Christian Faith_, 1821-22.  Complete Works, 1834-64.    Schleiermacher's conception of religion is opposed to the  rationalistic theology of the eighteenth century, as well as to the  Kantian moral theology which has remained popular in Germany to  this day. For him religion is not science or philosophy; it does  not consist in theoretical dogmas or rationalistic proofs; neither  theories about religion nor virtuous conduct nor acts of worship are  religion itself; nor is religion based upon a rational moral faith,  as Kant had taught. He bravely took the part of Fichte in the  atheism-controversy, when the great leaders of German"]]]
