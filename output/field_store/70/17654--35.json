He had become so hard up that to pay the  drovers in his last venture he was forced to sell the calves of the few  milch-cows retained for household uses.    At this time it came to my father's knowledge that one of our bishops  had money held in trust for the Church. On good security he was giving  this out for usury, the same as condemned in the big Bible, out of which  he took the text of the dry-hash sermons with which he bored his  fashionable congregations in his cathedral on Sundays.    Father took advantage of this Reverend's inconsistency and mortgaged  Possum Gully. With the money thus obtained he started once more and  managed to make a scant livelihood and pay the interest on the bishop's  loan. In four or five years he had again reached loggerheads. The price  of stock had fallen so that there was nothing to be made out of dealing  in them.    Richard Melvyn resolved to live as those around him--start a dairy; run  it with his family, who would also rear poultry for sale.    As instruments of the dairying trade he procured fifty milch-cows, the  calves of which had to be \"poddied\", and a hand cream-separator.    I was in my fifteenth year when we began dairying; the twins Horace and  Gertie were, as you already know, eleven months younger. Horace, had  there been any one to train him, contained the makings of a splendid  man; but having no one to bring him up in the way he should go, he was a  churlish and trying bully, and the issue of his character doubtful.    Gertie milked thirteen cows, and I eighteen, morning and evening. Horace  and mother, between them, milked the remaining seventeen.    Among the dairying fraternity little toddlers, ere they are big enough  to hold a bucket, learn to milk. Thus their hands become inured to the  motion, and it does not affect them. With us it was different. Being  almost full grown when we started to milk, and then plunging heavily  into the exercise, it had a painful effect upon us. Our hands and arms,  as far as the elbows, swelled, so that our sleep at night was often  disturbed by pain.    Mother made the butter. She had to rise at two and three o'clock in the  morning, in order that it would be cool and firm enough to print for  market.    Jane Haizelip had left us a year previously, and we could afford no one  to take her place. The heavy work told upon my gentle, refined mother.  She grew thin and careworn, and often cross. My father's share of the  work was to break in the wild cows, separate the milk, and take the  butter into town to the grocer's establishment where we obtained our  supplies.    Dick Melvyn of Bruggabrong was not recognizable in Dick Melvyn, dairy  farmer and cocky of Possum Gully. The former had been a man worthy of  the name. The latter was a slave of drink, careless, even dirty and  bedraggled in his personal appearance. He disregarded all manners, and  had become far more plebeian and common than the most miserable specimen  of humanity around him. The support of his family, yet not, its support.  The head of his family, yet failing to fulfil the obligations demanded  of one in that capacity. He seemed to lose all love and interest in his  family, and grew cross and silent, utterly without pride and pluck.  Formerly so kind and gentle with animals, now he was the reverse.    His cruelty to the young cows and want of patience with them I can never  forget. It has often brought upon me the threat of immediate  extermination for volunteering scathing and undesired opinions on his  conduct.    The part of the dairying that he positively gloried in was going to town  with the butter. He frequently remained in for two or three days, as  often as not spending all the money he got for the butter in a drunken  spree. Then he would return to curse his luck because his dairy did not  pay as well as those of some of our neighbours.    The curse of Eve being upon my poor mother in those days, she was unable  to follow her husband. Pride forbade her appealing to her neighbours, so  on me devolved the duty of tracking my father from one pub to another  and bringing him home.    Had I done justice to my mother's training I would have honoured my  paternal parent in spite of all this, but I am an individual ever doing  things I oughtn't at the time I shouldn't.    Coming home, often after midnight, with my drunken father talking  maudlin conceited nonsense beside me, I developed curious ideas on the  fifth commandment. Those journeys in the spring-cart through the soft  faint starlight were conducive to thought. My father, like most men when  under the influence of liquor, would allow no one but himself to handle  the reins, and he was often so incapable that he would keep turning the  horse round and round in the one place. It is a marvel we never met with  an accident. I was not nervous, but quite content to take whatever came,  and our trusty old horse fulfilled his duty, ever faithfully taking us  home along the gum-tree-lined road.    My mother had taught me from the Bible that I should honour my parents,  whether they were deserving of honour or not.    Dick Melvyn being my father did not blind me to the fact that he was a  despicable, selfish, weak creature, and as such I despised him with the  relentlessness of fifteen, which makes no allowance for human frailty  and weakness. Disgust, not honour, was the feeling which possessed me  when I studied the matter.    Towards mother I felt differently. A woman is but the helpless tool of  man--a creature of circumstances.    Seeing my father beside me, and thinking of his infant with its mother,  eating her heart out with anxiety at home, this was the reasoning which  took possession of me. Among other such inexpressible thoughts I got  lost, grew dizzy, and drew back appalled at the spirit which was  maturing within me. It was a grim lonely one, which I vainly tried to  hide in a bosom which was not big or strong enough for its comfortable  habitation. It was as a climbing plant without a pole--it groped about  the ground, bruised itself, and became hungry searching for something  strong to which to cling. Needing a master-hand to train and prune, it  was becoming rank and sour.          CHAPTER FIVE    Disjointed Sketches And Grumbles      It was my duty to \"rare the poddies\". This is the most godless  occupation in which it has been my lot to engage. I did a great amount  of thinking while feeding them--for, by the way, I am afflicted with the  power of thought, which is a heavy curse. The less a person thinks and  inquires regarding the why and the wherefore and the justice of things,  when dragging along through life, the happier it is for him, and doubly,  trebly so, for her.    Poor little calves! Slaves to the greed of man! Bereft of the mothers  with which Nature has provided them, and compelled to exist on milk from  the separator, often thick, sour, and icy cold.    Besides the milking I did, before I went to school every morning, for  which I had to prepare myself and the younger children, and to which we  had to walk two miles. I had to feed thirty calves and wash the  breakfast dishes. On returning from school in the afternoon, often in a  state of exhaustion from walking in the blazing sun, I had the same  duties over again, and in addition boots to clean and home lessons to  prepare for the morrow. I had to relinquish my piano practice for want  of time.    Ah, those short, short nights of rest and long, long days of toil! It  seems to me that dairying means slavery in the hands of poor people who  cannot afford hired labour. I am not writing of dairy-farming, the  genteel and artistic profession as eulogized in leading articles of  agricultural newspapers and as taught in agricultural colleges. I am  depicting practical dairying as I have lived it, and seen it lived, by  dozens of families around me.    It takes a great deal of work to produce even one pound of butter fit  for market. At the time I mention it was 3d. and 4d. per lb., so it was  much work and small pay. It was slaving and delving from morning till  night--Sundays, week-days, and holidays, all alike were work-days to us.    Hard graft is a great leveller. Household drudgery, woodcutting,  milking, and gardening soon roughen the hands and dim the outside  polish. When the body is wearied with much toil the desire to cultivate  the mind, or the cultivation it has already received, is gradually wiped  out. Thus it was with my parents. They had dropped from swelldom to  peasantism. They were among and of the peasantry. None of their former  acquaintances came within their circle now, for the iron ungodly hand of  class distinction has settled surely down upon Australian  society--Australia's democracy is only a tradition of the past.    I say naught against the lower life. The peasantry are the bulwarks of  every nation. The life of a peasant is, to a peasant who is a peasant  with a peasant's soul, when times are good and when seasons smile, a  grand life. It is honest, clean, and wholesome. But the life of a  peasant to me is purgatory. Those around me worked from morning till  night and then enjoyed their well-earned sleep. They had but two states  of existence--work and sleep.    There was a third part in me which cried out to be fed. I longed for the  arts. Music was a passion with me. I borrowed every book in the  neighbourhood and stole hours from rest to read them. This told upon me  and made my physical burdens harder for me than for other children of my  years around me. That third was the strongest part of me. In it I lived  a dream-life with writers, artists, and musicians. Hope, sweet, cruel,  delusive Hope, whispered in my ear that life was long with much by and  by, and in that by and by my dream-life would be real. So on I went with  that gleaming lake in the distance beckoning me to come and sail on its  silver waters, and Inexperience,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11637"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

This tree is now in bloom. It is a native of North America, where it is  vulgarly called the poplar. The first which produced blossoms in this  country, is said to have been at the Earl of Peterborough's, at Parson's  Green, near Fulham. In 1688 this tree was cultivated by Bishop Compton  at Fulham, who introduced a great number of new plants from North  America. At Waltham Abbey, is a tulip tree, supposed to be the largest  in England. The leaves of the tulip tree are very curious, and appear as  if cut off with scissors. The flowers, though not glaring, are  singularly beautiful, resembling a small tulip, variegated with green,  yellow and orange, standing solitary at the ends of the branches. I saw  one of these curious trees in full bloom a few days since between  Edmonton and Enfield.    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      CHANGES DURING THE MATURATION OF FRUIT.      The sap is changed into a viscid fluid, which circulates under the bark:  this is called _cambium_. When it is too abundant it is effused, part of  its water evaporates, and it becomes gum. If the vital circle is not  interrupted, the fluid traverses the branches, and the peduncle arrives  in the ovary, and constitutes the pericarp. In this passage it is partly  modified: it appropriates to itself the oxygen of its water of  composition; hence the malic, citric, and tartaric acids. As the fruit  becomes developed, the pellicle thins, becomes transparent, and allows  both light and heat to exercise a more marked influence. It is during  this period that maturation commences. The acids react on the cambium,  which flows into the fruit, and, aided by the increased temperature,  convert it into saccharine matter; at the same time they disappear,  being saturated with gelatine, when maturation is complete.--_London  Medical and Surgical Journal_.    We may here observe that in a recent paper, by Mr. J. Williams, in the  Transactions of the Horticultural Society, the cause of apples becoming  _russet_ is attributed to the alternating temperature, light, shade,  dryness, and moisture, which occur many times in the course of a day,  when July or August is showery. Continued rain, preceded and followed by  a cloudy sky, does not seem to produce the same effect, but the sudden,  intense light which commonly succeeds a shower at the time the fruit is  wet, injures the skin, and occasions small cracks, like the network upon  a melon.           *       *       *       *       *      MIGRATION OF BIRDS.      Whatever theory of instinct may be finally fixed upon as the most  correct and philosophical, (to account for the migratory movements of  birds,) it is obvious that we cut rather than untie the gordian knot  when we talk of the foresight of the brute creation. We might as well  talk of the foresight of a barometer. There can be little doubt that  birds, prior to their migratory movements, are influenced by  atmospherical changes, or other physical causes, which, however beyond  the sphere of our perceptions, are sufficient for their guidance. That  they are not possessed of the power of divination may be exemplified by  the following instance. The winter of 1822 was so remarkably mild  throughout Europe, that primroses came generally into flower by the end  of December,--rye was in ear by the middle of March, and vines, in  sheltered situations, blossomed about the end of that month,--so that an  assured and unchecked spring was established at least four or five weeks  earlier than usual;--yet neither the cuckoo nor the swallow arrived a  single day before their accustomed periods. They are indeed, beautifully  and wisely directed,--\"Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her  appointed times; and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow, observe  the time of their coming.\"--(From a delightful paper upon American  Ornithology, in the _Quarterly Review_, just published.)           *       *       *       *       *        FINE ARTS.             *       *       *       *       *      STATUE OF MR. PITT.    [Illustration: Statue of Mr. Pitt.]      This splendid tribute to the memory of the darling minister, has been  placed at the south side of Hanover Square. It is of bronze, and stands  on a granite pedestal, of size disproportionate to the height and bulk  of the figure. The artist is Mr. Chantrey: the work being at the cost of  the nobility of the land, and a few ardent admirers of \"the system\"  introduced by Mr. Pitt into the government of this country. We have long  had festal celebrations and joyous commemorations of the natal day and  deeds of the minister--\"the darling of fame\"--but the above is the most  lasting memorial. Its bronze will in all probability outlast the mettle  of party. The resemblance is considered striking, and the effect of the  statue is bold and dignified. Biographers tell us that \"in person, Pitt  was tall, slender, well-proportioned, and active. He had blue eyes,  rather a fair complexion, prominent features, and a high, capacious  forehead. His aspect was severe and forbidding; his voice clear and  powerful; his action dignified, but neither graceful nor engaging; his  tone and manners, although urbane and complacent in society, were lofty,  and even arrogant, in the senate. On entering the house, it was his  custom to stalk sternly to his place, without honouring even his most  favoured adherents with a word, a nod, or even a glance of recognition.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE DIORAMA, REGENT'S PARK      Has reopened with two new views--Paris from Montmartre, (by no means a  new, but, perhaps, the best, point of view of the city,)--and the famed  Campo Santo of Pisa. The execution of both scenes is calculated to  maintain the _unique_ reputation of the establishment. They have the  fine effects, the finishing touches, of master-hands.           *       *       *       *       *        NEW BOOKS.             *       *       *       *       *      THE TRIALS OF CHARLES I.      (With those of some of the Regicides have been prepared for the 31st  volume of the _Family Library_. We suspect the editor to be M.  D'Israeli, who has been poring over the records and fingering the dust  of the Royal \"martyr\" for many years past. Our honourable friend,  Clavering, of the _Metropolitan_, in his recollections of the British  Museum, long since, says, \"there sat D'Israeli, daily extracting from  the voluminous M.S. letters of James I. and Charles I.\" Whoever the  compiler of this volume may be, it must be allowed that, in the form of  notes and biographies, he has brought into less than 350 pages a greater  collection of interesting incidents connected with his main subject than  many writers would have cared to assemble; and he has accordingly  produced a work, in every respect, fitted for popular reading. We quote  passages from the Execution to the Interment of Charles, but we have not  room for the Editor's very pertinent \"Remarks on the Trial.\")    On the morning of his death, Charles, according to the relation of his  faithful attendant, Sir Thos. Herbert, awoke about two hours before  daybreak, after a sound sleep of four hours. He called to Herbert, who  lay on a pallet, by his bedside, and bade him rise; \"for,\" said the  King, \"I will get up, I have a great work to do this day.\" He then gave  orders what clothes he would wear, and said to his attendant, \"Let me  have a shirt on more than ordinary, by reason the season is so sharp[4]  as probably may make me shake, which some observers will imagine  proceeds from fear. I would have no such imputation. I fear not  death--death is not terrible to me. I bless God, I am prepared.\" Soon  after the King was dressed, Bishop Juxon came to him, according to his  appointment the night before. He"]]]
