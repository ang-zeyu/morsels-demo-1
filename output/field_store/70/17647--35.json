In the thirteenth century  disputes over the power and jurisdiction of the clergy led, with other  matters, to civil war, ending in submission to Norway, and the breaking  down of all native great houses. Although life under the commonwealth  had been rough and irregular, it had been free and varied, breeding  heroes and men of mark; but the \"law and order\" now brought in left  all on a dead level of peasant proprietorship, without room for hope  or opening for ambition. An alien governor ruled the island, which  was divided under him into local counties, administered by sheriffs  appointed by the king of Norway. The Al-thing was replaced by a royal  court, the local work of the local things was taken by a subordinate  of the sheriff, and things, quarter-courts, trial by jury, and all the  rest, were swept away to make room for these \"improvements\", which have  lasted with few changes into this century. In 1380 the island passed  under the rule of Denmark, and so continues. (9) During the fifteenth  century the English trade was the only link between Iceland and the  outer world; the Danish government weakened that link as much as it  could, and sought to shut in and monopolise everything Icelandic; under  the deadening effect of such rule it is no marvel that everything found  a lower level, and many things went out of existence for lack of use.  In the sixteenth century there is little to record but the Reformation,  which did little good, if any, and the ravages of English, Gascon, and  Algerine pirates who made havoc on the coast; (10) they appear toward  the close of the century and disappear early in the seventeenth. In the  eighteenth century small-pox, sheep disease, famine, and the terrible  eruptions of 1765 and 1783, follow one another swiftly and with terrible  effect. At the beginning of the present century Iceland, however,  began to shake off the stupor her ill-hap had brought upon her, and  as European attention had been drawn to her, she was listened to.  Newspapers, periodicals, and a Useful Knowledge Society were started;  then came free trade, and the \"home-rule\" struggle, which met with  partial success in 1874, and is still being carried on. A colony, Gimli,  in far-off Canada, has been formed of Icelandic emigrants, and large  numbers have left their mother-land; but there are many co-operative  societies organised now, which it is hoped will be able to so revive the  old resources of the island as to make provision for the old population  and ways of life. There is now again a representative central council,  but very many of the old rights and powers have not been yet restored.  The condition of society is peculiar absence of towns, social equality,  no abject poverty or great wealth, rarity of crime, making it easy for  the whole country to be administered as a co-operative commonwealth  without the great and striking changes rendered necessary by more  complicated systems.    Iceland has always borne a high name for learning and literature; on  both sides of their descent people inherited special poetic power. Some  of older Eddaic fragments attest the great reach and deep overpowering  strength of imagination possessed by their Norse ancestors; and  they themselves had been quickened by a new leaven. During the first  generations of the \"land-taking\" a great school of poetry which had  arisen among the Norsemen of the Western Isles was brought by them to  Iceland. (11) The poems then produced are quite beyond parallel with  those of any Teutonic language for centuries after their date, which lay  between the beginning of the ninth and the end of the tenth centuries.  Through the Greenland colony also came two, or perhaps more, great poems  of this western school. This school grew out of the stress and storm of  the viking life, with its wild adventure and varied commerce, and the  close contact with an artistic and inventive folk, possessed of high  culture and great learning. The infusion of Celtic blood, however  slight it may have been, had also something to do with the swift intense  feeling and rapidity of passion of the earlier Icelandic poets. They  are hot-headed and hot-hearted, warm, impulsive, quick to quarrel or  to love, faithful, brave; ready with sword or song to battle with all  comers, or to seek adventure wheresoever it might be found. They leave  Iceland young, and wander at their will to different courts of northern  Europe, where they are always held in high honour. Gunnlaug Worm-tongue  (12) in 1004 came to England, after being in Norway, as the saga  says:--\"Now sail Gunnlaug and his fellows into the English main, and  come at autumntide south to London Bridge, where they hauled ashore  their ship. Now, at that time King Ethelred, the son of Edgar, ruled  over England, and was a good lord; the winter he sat in London. But  in those days there was the same tongue in England as in Norway and  Denmark; but the tongues changed when William the Bastard won England,  for thenceforward French went current there, for he was of French kin.  Gunnlaug went presently to the king, and greeted him well and worthily.  The king asked him from what land he came, and Gunnlaug told him all as  it was. 'But,' said he, 'I have come to meet thee, lord, for that I have  made a song on thee, and I would that it might please thee to hearken to  that song.' The king said it should be so, and Gunnlaug gave forth the  song well and proudly, and this is the burden thereof--         \"'As God are all folk fearing       The fire lord King of England,       Kin of all kings and all folk,       To Ethelred the head bow.'    The king thanked him for the song, and gave him as song-reward a scarlet  cloak lined with the costliest of furs, and golden-broidered down to  the hem; and made him his man; and Gunnlaug was with him all the winter,  and was well accounted of.    The poems in this volume are part of the wonderful fragments which  are all that remain of ancient Scandinavian poetry. Every piece which  survives has been garnered by Vigfusson and Powell in the volumes of  their \"Corpus\", where those who seek may find. A long and illustrious  line of poets kept the old traditions, down even to within a couple  centuries, but the earlier great harvest of song was never again  equalled. After christianity had entered Iceland, and that, with other  causes, had quieted men's lives, although the poetry which stood to the  folk in lieu of music did not die away, it lost the exclusive hold it  had upon men's minds. In a time not so stirring, when emotion was not so  fervent or so swift, when there was less to quicken the blood, the story  that had before found no fit expression but in verse, could stretch its  limbs, as it were, and be told in prose. Something of Irish influence  is again felt in this new departure and that marvellous new growth, the  saga, that came from it, but is little more than an influence. Every  people find some one means of expression which more than all else suits  their mood or their powers, and this the Icelanders found in the saga.  This was the life of a hero told in prose, but in set form, after a  regular fashion that unconsciously complied with all epical requirements  but that of verse--simple plot, events in order of time, set phrases for  even the shifting emotion or changeful fortune of a fight or storm,  and careful avoidance of digression, comment, or putting forward by  the narrator of ought but the theme he has in hand; he himself is never  seen. Something in the perfection of the saga is to be traced to the  long winter's evenings, when the whole household, gathered together at  their spinning, weaving, and so on, would listen to one of their number  who told anew some old story of adventure or achievement. In very truth  the saga is a prose epic, and marked by every quality an epic should  possess. Growing up while the deeds of dead heroes were fresh in memory,  most often recited before the sharers in such deeds, the saga, in its  pure form, never goes from what is truth to its teller. Where the saga,  as this one of the Volsungs is founded upon the debris of songs and  poems, even then very old, tales of mythological heroes, of men quite  removed from the personal knowledge of the narrator, yet the story is  so inwound with the tradition of his race, is so much a part of his  thought-life, that every actor in it has for him a real existence. At  the feast or gathering, or by the fireside, as men made nets and women  spun, these tales were told over; in their frequent repetition by men  who believed them, though incident or sequence underwent no change,  they would become closer knit, more coherent, and each an organic whole.  Gradually they would take a regular and accepted form, which would ease  the strain upon the reciter's memory and leave his mind free to adorn  the story with fair devices, that again gave help in the making it  easier to remember, and thus aided in its preservation. After a couple  of generations had rounded and polished the sagas by their telling and  retelling, they were written down for the most part between 1141 and  1220, and so much was their form impressed upon the mind of the folk,  that when learned and literary works appeared, they were written in the  same style; hence we have histories alike of kingdoms, or families, or  miracles, lives of saints, kings, or bishops in saga-form, as well as  subjects that seem at first sight even less hopeful. All sagas that have  yet appeared in English may be found in the book-list at end of this  volume, but they are not a tithe of those that remain.    Of all the stories kept in being by the saga-tellers and left for our  delight, there is none that so epitomises human experience; has within  the same space so much of nature and of life; so fully the temper and  genius of the Northern folk, as that of the Volsungs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#4)"],[1,"the year  it was launched and if I was still a freelancer at the  Free Press Journal or on its staff. By then, I was not  keen on settling down in Goa. To me, Goa was still in  the backwaters of journalism. To leave a city like  Mumbai where journalism made blood rush in one's veins,  and go to Goa, where things moved at a snail's pace,  was something I dreaded. When I wanted to come to Goa,  I was found unwanted.    After leaving Free Press Journal and joining The Hindu,  I met Raul Fernandes one day in Mumbai. He was scouting  for talent for O Heraldo, then about to be turned into  an English-language daily. I knew Fernandes, though not  as well as his brother John and his dad, Antonio  Caetano Fernandes.    The Fernandes family was close friends with my friends  in Mumbai, the Ribeiros, owners of the Goan restaurant  in Dhobitalao called Snowflake. When in Goa, my friend  and I went to see AC, as he was popularly known, at the  Casa JD Fernandes store in Panaji. And whenever John  came to Mumbai to get supplies for their store, he  would visit Snowflake where I hung out most of my time.    Raul Fernandes and I met at the Kyani Restaurant in Dhobitalao   and he offered me to come to Goa as chief reporter.  The offer was unattractive financially for me to leave  The Hindu. I was given the impression that Ervelle Menezes,  than with Indian Express in Mumbai, was joining as  editor. Fernandes was in consultation with Menezes, I  was told. At a second meeting, Fernandes informed me  that Rajan Narayan was chosen to be the editor. I was  surprised. I never had any admiration for Narayan's  journalism. I had heard some stories about his  resignation from The Mirror, a monthly publication from  the Eve's Weekly group. Even though the offer of chief  reporter was not tempting, I was not keen on working  under Narayan.    I knew Narayan on a hi-and-bye basis when I was at Free  Press Journal and he was at Onlooker, a  sister-publication from the Free Press Journal group. I  forget what position he held at the Onlooker magazine,  and whether Narayan was there when M.J. Akbar edited it  or later when M. Rahman took over.    I once covered a function at the United States  Information Services (USIS) office in Mumbai where  Narayan was present. A well-known scholar of Black  studies was visiting Mumbai from the United States.  Narayan carried with him a book by this scholar. I  found it very preposterous on Narayan's part to bring  the heavy volume to the meeting.    In fairness to Narayan, he made O Heraldo what it's  today. I also heard some allegations about his  wheeling-dealing with powers-that-be in the government.  Many journalists and some politicians told me that  Narayan deserved the violent attack on him as his  journalism was biased. No matter what his journalism  is, the attack on him was a shameful incident in the  history of Goan journalism.    I am told he's Goa's bravest journalist. Maybe true, as  I am in no position to judge that from here in Canada.  But I find his writing very weak. His editorials and  columns have lot of spelling errors and the grammar is  often flawed. His column, Stray Thoughts, is not well  composed. Just a month or so ago, someone gave me old  copies of O Heraldo. Going through his column, I found  his thoughts not very cohesive. He writes in a  disjointed way. One thing I will agree, he writes  strongly, not sparing those whom he targets. If carving  a well-written piece is his fault, then using strong  language is his forte. I form my opinion not on just  the few papers I read recently, but also from reading O  Heraldo during my visits to Goa and from those at times  posted on the Goanet email list (http://www.goanet.org).     On holiday    Just after a year's stay in Canada, I came to Goa on a  holiday. One fine day, Fulgencio Rodrigues, once the  leader of the toddy-tappers association and a candidate  for the assembly, and a fellow-villager in Bogmallo,  came to my house and told me that Umaji Chowgule wanted  to meet with me.    I was taken aback as I didn't know Umaji personally.  Rodrigues, who worked for the Chowgules, took me on his  scooter to meet him Umaji at the Chowgule offices. To  my surprise, he offered me a job as joint editor of a  sports daily the Chowgules were then planning on  launching. The other editor was to be Antonio Botelho,  a former sports writer at The Navhind Times, who I knew  well, both as writer and later as one of the  office-bearers of the Goa Football Association.    I was a landed immigrant in Canada and my first  experience in Canada was not very good. There was  recession then on and I was finding it difficult to get  a job in my field. I worked in a warehouse for  sometime, making enough money to buy a ticket to India.    The offer came with a flat in the Sant Inez locality of  Panaji and a car. I told Umaji that if I accept the  position, I would forfeit my landed immigrant status in  Canada. I asked if what would happen if the paper  failed to fly. He said he would absorb me in the public  relations department of the Chowgules. I went to Sant  Inez with one of the Chowgule officers to select a  flat. I picked one. After that I went to the Gomantak  building to meet with Narayan Athawale, editor of Gomantak  . Umaji had explained that Athawale would be the  overall in charge of the new paper.    After speaking to Athawale, I met some workers. I  noticed some tension among them regarding the launch of  a new paper. The workers felt that profits from the Gomantak   paper would be diverted to sustain the new sports  daily. In other words, the workers would get lesser  bonuses. The atmosphere in the press seemed vitiated. I  was also aware of what happened to Evagrio Jorge. I was  contemplating whether I should risk my Canadian  immigration to remain in Goa. My heart and mind was  divided, and so was my family. My dad said I should  stay back as the job prospects in Canada very dim, but  my mom said I should go back and see what the future holds.    At the same time I was engaged and in a week or two  would get married. My future wife insisted that I  forego the offer and return to Canada. I gave the whole  thing a good thought and decided to tell Umaji that I  was not interested. He had told me that if I decide to  accept the offer, I should finally meet Ramesh Chowgule  who, I think, was the managing director of the Chowgule  group. I believe the paper was never launched. To this  day, I am not sure how the Chowgules came to know about  me. My hunch is that Prashant Joshi, former official of  the Goa Cricket Association, whose family owns the  Joshi and Sons Auto Center in Vasco, told Umaji about  me. I had gone to visit Joshi in Vasco when I came to Goa.    During my next visit to Goa, I was happy to know that  one of my colleagues at Free Press Journal, Padiyar,  was editor of The Navhind Times with another former  colleague, M.M. Mudaliar, as his associate. In fact,  Mudaliar was passed over by the management after Bikram Vohra   left to go to Khaleej Times in Dubai. Mudaliar and me  had lunch one day in a Panaji restaurant and he seemed  quite distraught. Padiyar, who joined The Navhind Times  from The Times of India where he had moved from Free  Press Journal, had a brief stint as editor as he passed  away following a heart attack.    I knew the publisher of The Navhind Times, Vilas Sardesai,  well because of his involvement with soccer. Once  when I was in Goa, he, D'Cunha and I travelled in a car  he borrowed from Vohra, as his own car was unavailable,  all the way from Panaji to Margao to watch a soccer  match. I never asked Sardesai for a favour to get me a  job at The Navhind Times. I was content working in  Mumbai where journalism flourished those days and  continues to do so till today.     Grown since    When I check websites of Goan papers or when some  friends and family bring Goan papers to Canada from  their visits, I notice that Goan journalism has grown  since I saw it first-hand. It behooves well for this  field that Goa now enjoys many dailies and has  correspondents of many leading Indian papers.    The quality of reporting and editing is still not very  impressive. What is, however, impressive is that the  new breed of journalists shows lot of guts and  vitality. I once discussed the teaching of journalism  with Fr. Planton Faria, who used to run the Diocesan  Communication Centre at the Archbishop's House at  Altinho in Panaji.    He showed me the student paper and I saw some good  writing. I am not aware if the centre is still  operating. Fr. Faria was editing a Konkani paper while  also running the centre.    It has been my ambition to have a journalism college in  Goa named after Frank Moraes, one of the finest editors  in Indian journalism. There may be many who would  dispute my suggestion on the basis that Moraes didn't  do anything for Goan journalism per se, and I totally  agree. No matter he did play a direct role in Goan  journalism, but he was a Goan journalist of repute.    One may argue that during the Portuguese days there  were many Goan journalists who played crucial roles in  promoting Goan journalism. Some of these journalists,  who were also leaders, were in the forefront of Goa's  liberation struggle. Maybe so, Moraes too played a  vital background role in Goa's liberation, largely  because of his close friendship with Prime Minister  Jawaharlal Nehru.    Whatever the case, a college of journalism, affiliated  to the Goa University, is a dream that I cherish and  hope it would be realized in my lifetime. Goa has a  privileged status in the history of the written word in  India with the publication of the first-ever book in  the country. Journalism is part of the written word  and, hence, a college that fosters the growth of  journalism would be ideal in the serene surrounding of  Goa's educational landscape. That's my thought to  ponder for those in the decision-making positions."]]]
