When he entered the saloon  he seemed nowise abashed by the silence, but greeted the turned heads  with a wave of the hand and a good-natured \"Howdy, boys!\" A volley of  greetings replied to him, for in the mountain-desert men cannot be  strangers after the first word.    \"Line up and hit the red-eye,\" he went on, and leaning against the  bar as he spoke, his habitual smile broadened into one of actual  invitation. Except for a few groups who watched the gambling in the  corners of the big room, there was a general movement towards the bar.    \"And make it a tall one, boys,\" went on the genial stranger. \"This is  the first time I ever irrigated Morgan's place, and from what I have  heard today about the closing I suppose it will be the last time. So  here's to you, Morgan!\"    And he waved his glass towards the bartender. His voice was well  modulated and his enunciation bespoke education. This, in connection  with his careful clothes and rather modish riding-boots, might have  given him the reputation of a dude, had it not been for several other  essential details of his appearance. His six-gun hung so low that he  would scarcely have to raise his hand to grasp the butt. He held his  whisky glass in his left hand, and the right, which rested carelessly  on his hip, was deeply sunburned, as if he rarely wore a glove.  Moreover, his eyes were marvellously direct, and they lingered a  negligible space as they touched on each man in the room. All of this  the cattlemen noted instantly. What they did not see on account of his  veiling fingers was that he poured only a few drops of the liquor into  his glass.    In the meantime another man who had never before \"irrigated\" at  Morgan's place, rode up. His mount, like that of the tawny-haired  rider, was considerably larger and more finely built than the common  range horse. In three days of hard work a cattle pony might wear down  these blooded animals, but would find it impossible to either overtake  or escape them in a straight run. The second stranger, short-legged,  barrel-chested, and with a scrub of black beard, entered the barroom  while the crowd was still drinking the health of Morgan. He took a  corner chair, pushed back his hat until a mop of hair fell down his  forehead, and began to roll a cigarette. The man of the tawny hair  took the next seat.    \"Seems to be quite a party, stranger,\" said the tall fellow  nonchalantly.    \"Sure,\" growled he of the black beard, and after a moment he added:  \"Been out on the trail long, pardner?\"    \"Hardly started.\"    \"So'm I.\"    \"As a matter of fact, I've got a lot of hard riding before me.\"    \"So've I.\"    \"And some long riding, too.\"    Perhaps it was because he turned his head suddenly towards the light,  but a glint seemed to come in the eyes of the bearded man.    \"Long rides,\" he said more amiably, \"are sure hell on hosses.\"    \"And on men, too,\" nodded the other, and tilted back in his chair.    The bearded man spoke again, but though a dozen cowpunchers were close  by no one heard his voice except the man at his side. One side of his  face remained perfectly immobile and his eyes stared straight before  him drearily while he whispered from a corner of his mouth: \"How long  do you stay, Lee?\"    \"Noon,\" said Lee.    Once more the shorter man spoke in the manner which is learned in a  penitentiary: \"Me too. We must be slated for the same ride, Lee. Do  you know what it is? It's nearly noon, and the chief ought to be  here.\"    There was a loud greeting for a newcomer, and Lee took advantage of  the noise to say quite openly: \"If Silent said he'll come, he'll be  here. But I say he's crazy to come to a place full of range riders,  Bill.\"    \"Take it easy,\" responded Bill. \"This hangout is away off our regular  beat. Nobody'll know him.\"    \"His hide is his own and he can do what he wants with it,\" said Lee.  \"I warned him before.\"    \"Shut up,\" murmured Bill, \"Here's Jim now, and Hal Purvis with him!\"    Through the door strode a great figure before whom the throng at the  bar gave way as water rolls back from the tall prow of a ship. In his  wake went a little man with a face dried and withered by the sun and  small bright eyes which moved continually from side to side. Lee and  Bill discovered their thirst at the same time and made towards the  newcomers.    They had no difficulty in reaching them. The large man stood with his  back to the bar, his elbows spread out on it, so that there was a  little space left on either side of him. No one cared to press too  close to this sombre-faced giant. Purvis stood before him and Bill and  Lee were instantly at his side. The two leaned on the bar, facing him,  yet the four did not seem to make a group set apart from the rest.    \"Well?\" asked Lee.    \"I'll tell you what it is when we're on the road,\" said Jim Silent.  \"Plenty of time, Haines.\"    \"Who'll start first?\" asked Bill.    \"You can, Kilduff,\" said the other. \"Go straight north, and go slow.  Then Haines will follow you. Purvis next. I come last because I got  here last. There ain't any hurry--What's this here?\"    \"I tell you I seen it!\" called an angry voice from a corner.    \"You must of been drunk an' seein' double, partner,\" drawled the  answer.    \"Look here!\" said the first man, \"I'm willin' to take that any way you  mean it!\"    \"An' I'm willin',\" said the other, \"that you should take it any way  you damn please.\"    Everyone in the room was grave except Jim Silent and his three  companions, who were smiling grimly.    \"By God, Jack,\" said the first man with ominous softness, \"I'll take a  lot from you but when it comes to doubtin' my word----\"    Morgan, with popping eyes and a very red face, slapped his hand on  the bar and vaulted over it with more agility than his plumpness  warranted. He shouldered his way hurriedly through the crowd to the  rapidly widening circle around the two disputants. They stood with  their right hands resting with rigid fingers low down on their hips,  and their eyes, fixed on each other, forgot the rest of the world.  Morgan burst in between them.    \"Look here,\" he thundered, \"it's only by way of a favour that I'm  lettin' you boys wear shootin' irons today because I promised old  Cumberland there wouldn't be no fuss. If you got troubles there's  enough room for you to settle them out in the hills, but there ain't  none at all in here!\"    The gleam went out of their eyes like four candles snuffed by the  wind. Obviously they were both glad to have the tension broken. Mike  wiped his forehead with a rather unsteady hand.    \"I ain't huntin' for no special brand of trouble,\" he said, \"but Jack  has been ridin' the red-eye pretty hard and it's gotten into that  dried up bean he calls his brain.\"    \"Say, partner,\" drawled Jack, \"I ain't drunk enough of the hot stuff  to make me fall for the line you've been handing out.\"    He turned to Morgan.    \"Mike, here, has been tryin' to make me believe that he knew a feller  who could drill a dollar at twenty yards every time it was tossed up.\"    The crowd laughed, Morgan loudest of all.    \"Did you anyways have Whistlin' Dan in mind?\" he asked.    \"No, I didn't,\" said Mike, \"an' I didn't say this here man I was  talkin' about could drill them every time. But he could do it two  times out of four.\"    \"Mike,\" said Morgan, and he softened his disbelief with his smile and  the good-natured clap on the shoulder, \"you sure must of been drinkin'  when you seen him do it. I allow Whistlin' Dan could do that an' more,  but he ain't human with a gun.\"    \"How d'you know?\" asked Jack, \"I ain't ever seen him packin' a  six-gun.\"    \"Sure you ain't,\" answered Morgan, \"but I have, an' I seen him use it,  too. It was jest sort of by chance I saw it.\"    \"Well,\" argued Mike anxiously, \"then you allow it's possible if  Whistlin' Dan can do it. An' I say I seen a chap who could turn the  trick.\"    \"An' who in hell is this Whistlin' Dan?\" asked Jim Silent.    \"He's the man that caught Satan, an' rode him,\" answered a bystander.    \"Some man if he can ride the devil,\" laughed Lee Haines.    \"I mean the black mustang that ran wild around here for a couple of  years. Some people tell tales about him being a wonder with a gun. But  Morgan's the only one who claims to have seen him work.\"    \"Maybe you did see it, and maybe you didn't,\" Morgan was saying to  Mike noncommittally, \"but there's some pretty fair shots in this  room, which I'd lay fifty bucks no man here could hit a dollar with a  six-gun at twenty paces.\"    \"While they're arguin',\" said Bill Kilduff, \"I reckon I'll hit the  trail.\"    \"Wait a minute,\" grinned Jim Silent, \"an' watch me have some fun with  these short-horns.\"    He spoke more loudly: \"Are you makin' that bet for the sake of  arguin', partner, or do you calculate to back it up with cold cash?\"    Morgan whirled upon him with a scowl, \"I ain't pulled a bluff in my  life that I can't back up!\" he said sharply.    \"Well,\" said Silent, \"I ain't so flush that I'd turn down fifty bucks  when a kind Christian soul, as the preachers say, slides it into my  glove. Not me. Lead out the dollar, pal, an' kiss it farewell!\"    \"Who'll hold the stakes?\" asked Morgan.    \"Let your friend Mike,\" said Jim Silent carelessly, and he placed  fifty dollars in gold in the hands of the Irishman. Morgan followed  suit. The crowd hurried outdoors.    A dozen bets were laid in as many seconds. Most of the men wished to  place their money on the side of Morgan, but there were not a few who  stood willing to risk coin on Jim Silent, stranger though he was.  Something in his unflinching eye, his stern face, and the nerveless  surety of his movements commanded their trust.    \"How do you stand, Jim?\" asked Lee Haines anxiously. \"Is it a safe  bet? I've never seen you try a mark like this one!\"    \"It ain't safe,\" said Silent, \"because I ain't mad enough to shoot my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#4)"],[1,"inscription: \"I am  abashed and thou art unashamed.\"    In many quarters at once, also, might be read the inscription:      \"Nero, Orestes, Alemeon, matricides.\"    Persons could actually be heard saying in so many words: \"Nero put his  mother out of the way.\" Not a few lodged information that certain persons  had spoken in this way, their object being not so much to destroy those  whom they accused as to bring reproach, on Nero. Hence he would admit no  suit of that kind, either not wishing that the rumor should become more  widespread by such means, or out of utter contempt for what was said.  However, in the midst of the sacrifices offered in memory of Agrippina  according to decree, the sun suffered a total eclipse and the stars could  be seen. Also, the elephants drawing the chariot of Augustus entered the  hippodrome and went as far as the senators' seats, but at that point they  stopped and refused to proceed farther. And the event which one might most  readily conjecture to have taken place through divine means was that a  thunderbolt descended upon his dinner and consumed it all as it was being  brought to him, like some tremendous harpy snatching away his food.    [Sidenote:--17--] [In spite of this he killed by poison also his aunt  Domitia, whom likewise he used to say he revered like a mother. He would  not even wait a few days for her to die a natural death of old age, but  was eager to destroy her also. His haste to do this was inspired by her  possessions at Baiae and Ravenna, which included magnificent amusement  pavilions that she had erected and] are in fine condition even now. In  honor of his mother he celebrated a very great and costly festival, events  taking place for several days in five or six theatres at once. It was then  that an elephant was led to the very top of the vault of the theatre and  walked down from that point on ropes, carrying a rider. There was another  exhibition at once most disgraceful and shocking. Men and women not only  of equestrian but even of senatorial rank appeared in the orchestra, the  hippodrome, and even the hunting-theatre, like the veriest outcasts. Some  of them played the flute and danced or acted tragedies and comedies or  sang to the lyre. They drove horses, killed beasts, fought as gladiators,  some willingly, others with a very bad grace. Men of that day beheld the  great families,--the Furii, the Horatii, the Fabii, Poreii, Valerii, and  all the rest whose trophies, whose temples were to be seen,--standing down  below the level of the spectators and doing some things to which no common  citizen even would stoop. So they would point them out to one another and  make remarks, Macedonians saying: \"That is the descendant of Paulus\";  Greeks, \"Yonder the offspring of Mummius\"; Sicilians, \"Look at Claudius\";  the Epirots, \"Look at Appius\"; Asiatics, \"There's Lucius\"; Iberians,  \"There's Publius\"; Carthaginians, \"There's Africanus\"; Romans, \"There they  all are\". Such was the expiation that the emperor chose to offer for his  own indecency.    [Sidenote:--18--] All who had sense, likewise, bewailed the multitude of  expenditures. Every costliest viand that men eat, everything else, indeed,  of the highest value,--horses, slaves, teams, gold, silver, raiment of  varied hues,--was given away by tickets. Nero would throw tiny balls, each  one appropriately inscribed, among the populace and that article  represented by the token received would be presented to the person who had  seized it. The sensible, I say, reflected that, when he spent so much to  prevent molestation in his disgraceful course, he would not be restrained  from any most outrageous proceedings through mere hope of profit.    Some portents had taken place about this time, which the seers declared  imported destruction to him, and they advised him to divert the danger  upon others. So he would have immediately put numbers of men out of the  way, had not Seneca said to him: \"No matter how many you may slay, you can  not kill your successor.\"    It was now that he celebrated a corresponding number of \"Preservation  Sacrifices,\" as he called them, and dedicated the forum for the sale of  dainties, called _Macellum_. [Sidenote:--19--] Somewhat later he  instituted a different kind of feast (called Juvenalia, a word that showed  it belonged in some way to \"youth\"). The occasion was the shaving of his  beard for the first time. The hairs he cast into a small golden globe and  offered to Jupiter Capitolinus. To furnish amusement members of the  noblest families as well as others did not fail to give exhibitions. For  instance, Aelia Catella danced: he was first of all a man prominent for  family and wealth and also advanced in years,--he was eighty years of age.  Others who on account of old age or disease could not do anything on their  own account sang as chorus. All devoted themselves to practicing as much  as and by whatever way they were able. Regularly appointed \"schools\" were  frequented by the most distinguished men, women, girls, lads, old women,  old men. In case any one was unable to appear in any other fashion, he  would enter the choruses. And whereas some of them out of shame had put on  masks to avoid being recognized, Nero at the request of the populace had  them taken off and showed these people to those by whom they had once been  ruled. Now most of all it was that these amateur performers and others  deemed the dead happy; for many of the foremost men this year had been  slain. Some of them, charged with conspiracy against Nero, were surrounded  by the soldiers and stoned to death.    [Sidenote:--20--] And, as there needed to be a fitting climax to these  deeds, Nero himself appeared as an actor and Gallio [Footnote: _L.  Iunius Gallio_.] proclaimed him by name. There stood Caesar on the  stage wearing the garb of a singing zither-player. Spoke the emperor: \"My  lords, of your kindness give me ear.\" Then did the Augustus sing to the  zither a thing called \"Attis or the Bacchantes,\" [Footnote: The title of  one of Nero's poems.] whilst many soldiers stood by and all the people  that the seats would hold sat watching. Yet had he (according to the  tradition) but a slight voice and an indistinct, so that he moved all  present to laughter and tears at once. Beside him stood Burrus and Seneca  like teachers prompting a pupil: they would wave their hands and togas at  every utterance and draw others on to do the same. Indeed, Nero had ready  a peculiar corps of about five thousand soldiers, called Augustans; these  would begin the applause, and all the rest, however loath, were obliged to  shout aloud with them,--except Thrasea. He would never stoop to such  conduct. But the rest, and especially the prominent men, gathered with  alacrity even when in grief and joined as if glad in all the shouts of the  Augustans. One could hear them saying: \"Excellent Caesar! Apollo!  Augustus! One like unto the Pythian! By thine own self, O Caesar, no one  can surpass thee!\" After this performance he entertained the people at a  feast on boats on the site of the naval battle given by Augustus: thence  at midnight he sailed through a canal into the Tiber.    [Sidenote: A.D. 60 (a.u. 813)] [Sidenote:--21--] This, then, he did to  celebrate the shaving of his chin. In behalf of his preservation and the  continuance of his authority,--thus he gave notice,--he instituted  quinquennial games, naming them Neronia. In honor of the event he also  constructed the gymnasium at the dedication of which he made a free  distribution of olive oil to the senators and knights. The crown for  singing to the zither, moreover, he took without a contest, for all others  were debarred on the assumption that they were unworthy of victory. [And  immediately in their garb he was enrolled on the very lists of the  gymnasium.] Thenceforward all other crowns for zither playing at all the  contests were sent to him as the only person competent to win victories of  that sort.
