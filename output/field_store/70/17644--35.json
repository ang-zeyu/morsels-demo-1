Dour and grim were the demi-gods and had the faults of both parents,  and would not mix with men but claimed the right of their fathers, and  would not play human games but forever were prophesying, and yet were  more frivolous than their mothers were, whom the fairies had long  since buried in wild wood gardens with more than human rites.    And being irked at their lack of rights and ill content with the land,  and having no power at all over the wind and snow, and caring little  for the powers they had, the demi-gods became idle, greasy, and slow;  and the contemptuous dwarfs despised them ever.    The dwarfs were contemptuous of all things savouring of heaven, and of  everything that was even partly divine.  They were, so it has been  said, of the seed of man; but, being squat and hairy like to the  beasts; they praised all beastly things, and bestiality was shown  reverence among them, so far as reverence was theirs to show.  So most  of all they despised the discontent of the demi-gods, who dreamed of  the courts of heaven and power over wind and snow; for what better,  said the dwarfs, could demi-gods do than nose in the earth for roots  and cover their faces with mire, and run with the cheerful goats and  be even as they?    Now in their idleness caused by their discontent, the seed of the gods  and the maidens grew more discontented still, and only spake of or  cared for heavenly things; until the contempt of the dwarfs, who heard  of all these doings, was bridled no longer and it must needs be war.  They burned spice, dipped in blood and dried, before the chief of  their witches, sharpening their axes, and made war on the demi-gods.    They passed by night over the Oolnar Mountains, each dwarf with his  good axe, the old flint war-axe of his fathers, a night when no moon  shone, and they went unshod, and swiftly, to come on the demi-gods in  the darkness beyond the dells of Ulk, lying fat and idle and  contemptible.    And before it was light they found the heathery lands, and the  demi-gods lying lazy all over the side of a hill.  The dwarfs stole  towards them warily in the darkness.    Now the art that the gods love most is the art of war: and when the  seed of the gods and those nimble maidens awoke and found it was war  it was almost as much to them as the godlike pursuits of heaven,  enjoyed in the marble courts; or power over wind and snow.  They all  drew out at once their swords of tempered bronze, cast down to them  centuries since on stormy nights when their fathers, drew them and  faced the dwarfs, and casting their idleness from them, fell on them,  sword to axe.  And the dwarfs fought hard that night, and bruised the  demi-gods sorely, hacking with those huge axes that had not spared the  oaks.  Yet for all the weight of their blows and the cunning of their  adventure, one point they had overlooked: _the demi-gods were  immortal._    As the fight rolled on towards morning the fighters were fewer and  fewer, yet for all the blows of the dwarfs men fell upon one side  only.    Dawn came and the demi-gods were fighting against no more than six,  and the hour that follows dawn, and the last of the dwarfs was gone.    And when the light was clear on that peak of the Bleaks of Eerie the  eagle left his crag and flew grimly East, and found it was as he had  hoped in the matter of blood.    But the demi-gods lay down in their heathery lands, for once content  though so far from the courts of heaven, and even half forgot their  heavenly rights, and sighed no more for power over wind and snow.          HOW THE GODS AVENGED MEOUL KI NING    Meoul Ki Ning was on his way with a lily from the lotus ponds of Esh  to offer it to the Goddess of Abundance in her temple Aoul Keroon. And  on the road from the pond to the little hill and the temple Aoul  Keroon, Ap Ariph, his enemy, shot him with an arrow from a bow that he  had made out of bamboo, and took his pretty lily up the hill and  offered it to the Goddess of Abundance in her temple Aoul Keroon. And  the Goddess was pleased with the gift, as all women are, and sent  pleasant dreams to Ap Ariph for seven nights straight from the moon.    And on the seventh night the gods held conclave together, on the  cloudy peaks they held it, above Narn, Ktoon, and Pti.  So high their  peak arises that no man heard their voices.  They spake on that cloudy  mountain (not the highest hamlet heard them).  \"What doth the Goddess  of Abundance,\" (but naming her Lling, as they name her), \"what doth  she sending sweet dreams for seven nights to Ap Ariph?\"    And the gods sent for their seer who is all eyes and feet, running to  and fro on the Earth, observing the ways of men, seeing even their  littlest doings, never deeming a doing too little, but knowing the web  of the gods is woven of littlest things.  He it is that sees the cat  in the garden of parakeets, the thief in the upper chamber, the sin of  the child with the honey, the women talking indoors and the small  hut's innermost things.  Standing before the gods he told them the  case of Ap Ariph and the wrongs of Meoul Ki Ning and the rape of the  lotus lily; he told of the cutting and making of Ap Ariph's bamboo  bow, of the shooting of Meoul Ki Ning, and of how the arrow hit him,  and the smile on the face of Lling when she came by the lotus bloom.    And the gods were wroth with Ap Ariph and swore to avenge Ki Ning.    And the ancient one of the gods, he that is older than Earth, called  up the thunder at once, and raised his arms and cried out on the gods'  high windy mountain, and prophesied on those rocks with runes that  were older than speech, and sang in his wrath old songs that he had  learned in storm from the sea, when only that peak of the gods in the  whole of the earth was dry; and he swore that Ap Ariph should die that  night, and the thunder raged about him, and the tears of Lling were  vain.    The lightning stroke of the gods leaping earthward seeking Ap Ariph  passed near to his house but missed him.  A certain vagabond was down  from the hills, singing songs in the street near by the house of Ap  Ariph, songs of a former folk that dwelt once, they say, in those  valleys, and begging for rice and curds; it was him the lightning hit.    And the gods were satisfied, and their wrath abated, and their thunder  rolled away and the great black clouds dissolved, and the ancient one  of the gods went back to his age-old sleep, and morning came, and the  birds and the light shone on the mountain, and the peak stood clear to  see, the serene home of the gods.          THE GIFT OF THE GODS    There was once a man who sought a boon of the gods.  For peace was  over the world and all things savoured of sameness, and the man was  weary at heart and sighed for the tents and the warfields.  Therefore  he sought a boon of the ancient gods.  And appearing before them he  said to them, \"Ancient gods; there is peace in the land where I dwell,  and indeed to the uttermost parts, and we are full weary of peace.  O  ancient gods, grant us war!\"    And the ancient gods made him a war.    And the man went forth with his sword, and behold it was even war. And  the man remembered the little things that he knew, and thought of the  quiet days that there used to be, and at night on the hard ground  dreamed of the things of peace.  And dearer and dearer grew the wonted  things, the dull but easeful things of the days of peace, and  remembering these he began to regret the war, and sought once more a  boon of the ancient gods, and appearing before them he said: \"O  ancient gods, indeed but a man loves best the days of peace. Therefore  take back your war and give us peace, for indeed of all your  blessedness peace is best.\"    And the man returned again to the haunts of peace.    But in a while the man grew weary of peace, of the things that he used  to know, and the savour of sameness again; and sighing again for the  tents, and appearing once more to the gods, he said to them: \"Ancient  gods; we do not love your peace, for indeed the days are dull, and a  man is best at war.\"    And the gods made him a war.    And there were drums again, the smoke of campfires again, wind in the  waste again, the sound of horses of war, burning cities again, and the  things that wanderers know; and the thoughts of that man went home to  the ways of peace; moss upon lawns again, light in old spires again,  sun upon gardens again, flowers in pleasant woods and sleep and the  paths of peace.    And once more the man appeared to the ancient gods and sought from  them one more boon, and said to them: \"Ancient gods; indeed but the  world and we are a-weary of war and long for the ancient ways and the  paths of peace.\"    So the gods took back their war and gave him peace.    But the man took counsel one day and communed long with himself and  said to himself: \"Behold, the wishes I wish, which the gods grant, are  not to be much desired; and if the gods should one day grant a wish  and never revoke it, which is a way of the gods, I should be sorely  tried because of my wish; my wishes are dangerous wishes and not to be  desired.\"    And therefore he wrote an anonymous letter to the gods, writing: \"O  ancient gods; this man that hath four times troubled you with his  wishes, wishing for peace and war, is a man that hath no reverence for  the gods, speaking ill of them on days when they do not hear, and  speaking well of them on holy days and at the appointed hours when the  gods are hearkening to prayer.  Therefore grant no more wishes to this  impious man.\"    And the days of peace wore on and there arose again from the earth,  like mist in the autumn from the fields that generations have  ploughed, the savour of sameness again.  And the man went forth one  morning and appeared once more to the gods, and cried: \"O ancient  gods; give us but one war again, for I would be back to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11462"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

One of the  Hospital's tickets drew the desired prize; and on the same night Hogarth  delivered the painting to the governors, not a little pleased that it  was to adorn a public place.\"    After quoting Walpole's description of Hogarth's _Sigismunda_, in which  he says--    \"To add to the disgust raised by such vulgar expression, her fingers  were blooded by her lover's heart, that lay before her like that of a  sheep for her dinner;--\"    Mr. C. observes, \"this is very severe, very pointed, and very untrue.  The Sigismunda of Hogarth is not tearing off her ornaments, nor are her  fingers bloodied by her lover's heart. It is said that the picture  resembled Mrs. Hogarth, who was a very handsome woman; and to this  circumstance Wilkes maliciously alludes in his unprincipled attack on  her husband. 'If the Sigismunda,' says this polite patriot, 'had a  resemblance of any thing ever seen on earth, or had the least pretence  to either meaning or expression, it was what he had seen, or perhaps  made--in real life--his own wife in an agony of passion; but of what  passion no connoisseur could guess.' That Mrs. Hogarth sat for the  picture of Sigismunda seems to have been known to conscientious John,  and this is supported by that lady's conduct to Walpole. This noble  biographer sent her a copy of his Anecdotes, accompanied by a courtly  and soothing note; but she was so much offended by his description of  the Sigismunda, that she took no notice of his present. The widow of the  artist was poor--and an opinion so ill-natured--so depreciating--and so  untrue, injured the property which she wished to sell: she loved too the  memory of her husband, and resented in the dignity of silence the  malicious and injurious attack. She considered the present as an insult  offered when she had no one to protect her. I love her pride and  reverence her affection.\"    Of Hogarth's house at Chiswick, we have the following slight notice:--    \"The time was now approaching when superstition, and folly, and vice,  were to be relieved from the satiric pencil which had awed them so  long--the health of Hogarth began to decline. He was aware of this, and  purchased a small house at Chiswick, to which he retired during the  summer, amusing himself with making slight sketches and retouching his  plates. This house stood till lately on a very pretty spot; but the  demon of building came into the neighbourhood, choked up the garden, and  destroyed the secluded beauty of Hogarth's cottage. The garden, well  stored with walnut, mulberry, and apple trees, contained a small study,  with a head-stone, placed over a favourite bullfinch, on which the  artist had etched the bird's head and written an epitaph. The cottage  contained many snug rooms, and was but yesterday the residence of a man  of learning and genius, Mr. Cary, the translator of Dante. The change of  scene, the free fresh air, and exercise on horseback, had for awhile a  favourable influence on Hogarth's health; but he complained that he was  no longer able to think with the readiness, and work with the elasticity  of spirit, of his earlier years. The friends of this artist observed,  and lamented, this falling away; his enemies hastened to congratulate  Churchill and Wilkes on the success of their malevolence; and these men  were capable of rejoicing in the belief that the work of nature was  their own.\"    We are glad to see Mr. Cunningham throwing light on false conclusions  drawn from the eccentricities of genius, as in this little anecdote:--    \"With Dr. Hoadley, who corrected the manuscript of the Analysis of  Beauty for the press, Hogarth was on such friendly terms that he was  admitted into one of the private theatrical exhibitions which the doctor  loved, and was appointed to perform along with Garrick and his  entertainer, a parody on that scene in Julius Caesar where the ghost  appears to Brutus. Hogarth personated the spectre, but so  unretentive--(we are told)--was his memory that though the speech  consisted only of two lines he was unable to get them by heart, and his  facetious associates wrote them on an illuminated lantern that he might  read them when he came upon the stage. Such is the way in which  anecdotes are manufactured, and conclusions of absence or imbecility  drawn. The speech of the ghost written on the paper lantern formed part  of the humour of the burlesque. Men, dull in comprehending the  eccentricities of genius, set down what passes their own understanding  to the account of the other's stupidity.\"    Here our notice of the Life of Hogarth would end, did we not feel  inclined to venture a word or two respecting the omission of Hogarth's  _Tailpiece_, engraved in Ireland's \"Life,\" and there described as his  last work. With the superstitious tale attached to it almost every one  is familiar; yet some notice ought surely to have been taken of the  story, even had it only been to expose its falsehood and absurdity.    We find that we have proceeded but half through the volume, so that  Wilson, Reynolds, and Gainsborough must remain for another number.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.             *       *       *       *       *      _Microscopic Objects._      The most delicate test objects for microscopes are the lines on the  feathers of butterflies or moths' wings, of which there are many  gradations; some easily demonstrated, and others only to be seen with  the most powerful reflectors, and to the best advantage by the simple  and uncondensed light of the lamp. The hair of a mouse is a very good  test object: it is best seen by daylight; the most difficult parts of  which are longitudinal lines in the transparent part of the hair, which  require high powers. The hair of the bat and seal are also fine tests.  The lines on the scales of the diamond beetle, &c. are excellent opaque  proof objects. The feet of flies are likewise very interesting.           *       *       *       *       *      _New Lilac Dyes._      Dr. Macculloch has lately produced two fine lilac dyes from plants of  domestic growth, not hitherto applied to this purpose. One is from the  berry of the Portugal laurel, and the other the black currant. The  simplest process with alum is all that is required for either; and as  far as his trials go, the best tint is produced by the former fruit.           *       *       *       *       *      _Dirty Windows._      We have frequently remarked small radiant and arborescent  crystallizations on dirty windows in London, and have found them to  consist of _sulphate of ammonia_. This salt, or at least, sulphite of  ammonia (which becomes sulphate by exposure to air), is an abundant  product of the combustion of coal.    _Brande's Journal._           *       *       *       *       *      _Indigo._      This valuable plant, which gives rise to as great speculation in India,  as hops in England, is much injured by wet weather; although the  rapidity of the growth of plants during much rain, in the temperature of  the tropics, is extraordinary, yet a proportional deficiency in all that  characterizes the vegetable world necessarily follows. This we find to  be the case with all forced vegetables; and the mildness of the radish  of hastened growth, when contrasted with the highly pungent and almost  acrid flavour of the slowly and gradually advanced one, may be adduced  as explanatory of this observation. Hence, it is practically well known  to manufacturers, that the indigo plant, however fine and luxuriant, as  is the natural result of much rain, is very deficient _in produce_, and  a similar loss is experienced even if the plant, without the fall of too  much rain, has grown up under cloudy weather. Sunshine, much and  continued sunshine, is essentially necessary for the proper exercise of  those secretory organs by which this peculiar drug is formed and  perfected.    Indigo leaves produce two dyes--blue and yellow; but the refuse leaves,  when boiled for an hour and a half, will render the water yellow, tinged  with green. This water, kept boiling for two hours, (supplying the loss  by evaporation), will, when filtered, afford a precipitate, which, when  dried, will in colour be a dun-slate, and in quantity perhaps about  equal to the blue extract such leaves have produced. This observation,  as it can lead to no practical advantage, is made for the man of  science, rather than the man of business.--_Mr. C. Weston_--_in Brande's  Journal._           *       *       *       *       *      _Chain Bridge._      Mr. Disney has lately erected at his seat the Hyde, Ingatestone, Essex,  a suspension bridge of common chain, which is much cheaper than either  wood or brick. It is fifty feet long, and four feet wide. The whole cost  of material, and workmanship scarcely exceeded 30_l_. Upon a rough  estimate, a wooden bridge of the same span would have cost from 80_l_.  to 100_l_., and a high arch probably from 150_l_. to 200_l_. The piers  or posts supporting the chains are of oak, but should they in ten or  fifteen years decay, 10_l_. in money, and three days in time would set  it up again.--_Brande's Jour._           *       *       *       *       *      _Stone Roofs._      The Romans employed _pumice_ in building their arched incombustible  roofs. This porous material possessed the additional advantage, when  combined with good cement, of rendering the arched surface one united  petrifaction, opposing (in consequence of its firm union) little lateral  pressure, comparatively, against the sustaining walls.    Bonomi, the architect, suggests that the principal cause of the  destructiveness of fires in large buildings, is the want of arched  surfaces of incombustible materials. This has been disastrously  exemplified in the destruction of the choir of York Minster, where the  roof of the aisles, which "]]]
