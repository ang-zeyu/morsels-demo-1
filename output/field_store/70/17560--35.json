Texts_, Part XXIV, Plate 44, l. 142).]    [Illustration: Terra-cotta plaque with a Typhonic animal in  relief. [No. 103,381.]]    In the consultation which took place between APSU and TIAMAT, their  messenger MU-UM-MU took part; of the history and attributes of this  last-named god nothing is known. The result of the consultation was that  a long struggle began between the demons and the gods, and it is clear  that the object of the powers of darkness was to destroy the light. The  whole story of this struggle is the subject of the Seven Tablets of  Creation. The gods are deifications of the sun, moon, planets and other  stars, and APSU, or CHAOS, and his companions the demons, are  personifications of darkness, night and evil. The story of the fight  between them is nothing more nor less than a picturesque allegory of  natural phenomena. Similar descriptions are found in the literatures of  other primitive nations, and the story of the great fight between  Her-ur, the great god of heaven, and Set, the great captain of the hosts  of darkness, may be quoted as an example. Set regarded the \"order\" which  Her-ur was bringing into the universe with the same dislike as that  with which APSU contemplated the beneficent work of Sin, the Moon-god,  Shamash, the Sun-god, and their brother gods. And the hostility of Set  and his allies to the gods, like that of Tiamat and her allies, was  everlasting.    [Illustration: between Marduk (Bel) and the Dragon. Drawn from a  bas-relief from the Palace of Ashur-nasir-pal, King of Assyria,  885-860 B.C., at Nimrud. [Nimrud Gallery, Nos. 28 and 29.]]    At this point a new Text fills a break in the First Tablet, and  describes the fight which took place between Nudimmud or Ea, (the  representative of the established \"order\" which the rule of the gods had  introduced into the domain of Apsu and Tiamat) and Apsu and his envoy  Mummu. Ea went forth to fight the powers of darkness and he conquered  Apsu and Mummu. The victory over Apsu, i.e., the confused and boundless  mass of primeval water, represents the setting of impassable boundaries  to the waters that are on and under the earth, i.e., the formation of  the Ocean. The exact details of the conquest cannot be given, but we  know that Ea was the possessor of the \"pure (or white, or holy)  incantation\" and that he overcame Apsu and his envoy by the utterance of  a powerful spell. In the Egyptian Legend of Ra and Aapep, the  monster is rendered spell-bound by the god Her-Tuati, who plays in it  exactly the same part as Ea in the Babylonian Legend.    When Tiamat heard of Ea's victory over Apsu and Mummu  she was filled with fury, and determined to avenge the death  of Apsu, her husband.    The first act of TIAMAT after the death of Apsu was to increase the  number of her allies. We know that a certain creature called  \"UMMU-KHUBUR\" at once spawned a brood of devilish monsters to help her  in her fight against the gods. Nothing is known of the origin or  attributes of UMMU-KHUBUR, but some think she was a form of TIAMAT. Her  brood probably consisted of personifications of mist, fog, cloud, storm,  whirlwinds and the blighting and destroying powers which primitive man  associated with the desert. An exact parallel of this brood of devils is  found in Egyptian mythology where the allies of Set and Aapep are  called \"Mesu betshet\" i.e., \"spawn of impotent revolt.\" They are  depicted in the form of serpents, and some of them became the \"Nine  Worms of Amenti\" that are mentioned in the Book of the Dead  (Chap. Ia).    Not content with Ummu-Khubur's brood of devils, Tiamat called the  stars and powers of the air to her aid, for she \"set up\" (1) the  Viper, (2) the Snake, (3) the god Lakhamu, (4) the Whirlwind, (5) the  ravening Dog, (6) the Scorpion-man, (7) the mighty Storm-wind, (8) the  Fish-man, and (9) the Horned Beast. These bore (10) the \"merciless,  invincible weapon,\" and were under the command of (11) Kingu, whom  Tiamat calls \"her husband.\" Thus Tiamat had Eleven mighty Helpers  besides the devils spawned by Ummu-Khubur.  We may note in passing  that some of the above-mentioned Helpers appear among the Twelve Signs  of the Zodiac which Marduk \"set up\" after his conquest of Tiamat,  e.g., the Scorpion-man, the Horned Beast, etc. This fact  suggests that the first Zodiac was \"set up\" by Tiamat, who with her  Eleven Helpers formed the Twelve Signs; the association of evil with  certain stars may date from that period. That the Babylonians regarded  the primitive gods as powers of evil is clear from the fact that  Lakhamu, one of them, is enumerated among the allies of Tiamat.    The helpers of Tiamat were placed by her under the command of a god  called KINGU who is TAMMUZ. He was the counterpart, or equivalent, of  ANU, the Sky-god, in the kingdom of darkness, for it is said in the text  \"Kingu was exalted and received the power of Anu,\" i.e., he possessed  the same power and attributes as Anu. When Tiamat appointed Kingu to be  her captain, she recited over him a certain spell or incantation, and  then she gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES and fastened it to his breast,  saying, \"Whatsoever goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established.\"  Armed with all the magical powers conferred upon him by this Tablet, and  heartened by all the laudatory epithets which his wife Tiamat heaped  upon him, Kingu went forth at the head of his devils.    When Ea heard that Tiamat had collected her forces and Was determined  to continue the fight against the gods which Apsu and Mummu had begun,  and that she had made her husband Kingu her champion, he was  \"afflicted\" and \"sat in sorrow.\" He felt unable to renew the fight  against the powers of darkness, and he therefore went and reported the  new happenings to Anshar, representative of the \"host of heaven,\" and  took counsel with him. When Anshar heard the matter he was greatly  disturbed in mind and bit his lips, for he saw that the real  difficulty was to find a worthy antagonist for Kingu and Tiamat. A gap  in the text here prevents us from knowing exactly what Anshar said and  did, but the context suggests that he summoned Anu, the Sky-god, to  his assistance. Then, having given him certain instructions, he sent  him on an embassy to Tiamat with the view of conciliating her. When  Anu reached the place where she was he found her in a very wrathful  state, and she was muttering angrily; Anu was so appalled at the sight  of her that he turned and fled. It is impossible at present to explain  this interlude, or to find any parallel to it in other ancient  Oriental literature.    [Illustration: Shamash the Sun-god rising on the horizon, flames of  fire ascending from his shoulder.  The two portals of the dawn, each  surmounted by a lion, are being drawn open by attendant gods. From a  Babylonian seal cylinder in the British Museum. [No. 89,110.]]    When Anu reported his inability to deal with Tiamat, a council of the  gods was called, and Ea induced his son, Marduk to be present. We next  find Anshar in converse with the god Marduk, who offers to act as the  champion of the gods and to fight Tiamat and her allies. Marduk being a  form of the Sun-god, the greatest of all the powers of light, thus  becomes naturally the protagonist of the gods, and the adversary of  Tiamat and her powers of darkness. Then Anshar summoned a great council  of the gods, who forthwith met in a place called \"Upshukkinaku\", which  may be described as the Babylonian Olympus. It was all-important for  Marduk to appear at the council of the gods before he undertook his  task, because it was necessary for him to be formally recognised by them  as their champion, and he needed to be endowed by them with magical  powers. The primitive gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu, and the Igigi, who may be  regarded as star-gods, were also summoned. A banquet was prepared, and  the gods attended, and having met and kissed each other they sat down,  and ate bread and drank hot and sweet sesame wine. The fumes of the wine  confused their senses, but they continued to drink, and at length \"their  spirits were exalted.\" They appointed Marduk to be their champion  officially, and then they proceeded to invest him with the power that  would cause every command he spake to be followed immediately by the  effect which he intended it to produce. Next Marduk, with the view of  testing the new power which had been given him, commanded a garment to  disappear and it did so; and when he commanded it to reappear it did so.

And as they handed to him these things they commanded him to go  and hack the body of Tiamat in pieces, and to scatter her blood to the  winds. Thereupon Marduk began to arm himself for the fight. He took a  bow, a spear, and a club; he filled his body full of fire and set the  lightning before him. He took in his hands a net wherewith to catch  Tiamat, and he placed the four winds near it, to prevent her from  escaping from it when he had snared her. He created mighty winds and  tempests to assist him, and grasped the thunderbolt in his hand; and  then, mounting upon the Storm,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9922"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

(_Concluded from page 74._ [Note: Mirror 266])      Things were in this state when I visited S----, and the union of Henri  and Rosalie, though not positively fixed, was regarded as an event by no  means distant. Every one was interested for the young and handsome  couple, and wished for their espousal. Rosalie's friends longed for the  day when she was to wed the young and handsome Henri; and Henri's  comrades were perpetually urging him to cement his union with the  lovely Rosalie.    We left the place with every kind wish for the young and betrothed pair.  I have not since revisited S----, but by letters from my friend, I have  been informed, that this commencement of their loves had a sad and  melancholy sequel.    After our departure, it seems, the lovers continued equally attached;  arrangements were making for their union, and it was intended that Henri  should leave the army previous to their marriage. But just at this  juncture, and as he was about to leave his corps, rumours of war were  circulated, the enterprise against Spain was projected, and the royal  guard was one of the first corps ordered for service. Henri, with the  natural enthusiasm of a soldier, felt all his former ardour revive; and  longed to mingle in the ranks of glory, ere he left them for ever. He,  doubtless, felt severely the separation from Rosalie; yet his feelings  were described to me as being of a joyous character, and as if evincing  that he felt happy that the opportunity of joining his brethren in arms,  and of signalizing himself perhaps for the last time, had presented  itself, previous to his marriage and his quitting the service.    The enterprise against Spain, he considered as the French army commonly  did, to be a mere excursion of pleasure, which, while it led them into a  country which many of them had never visited before, would also afford  them the occasion of gathering laurels which might serve to redeem  somewhat of their lost glory. He therefore looked forward to the  expedition, on the whole, with feelings of ardour and delight, and even  longed for its approach. Not so Rosalie! She looked on war and bloodshed  with the natural apprehensions of her sex; and saw in the projected  expedition, and its prospects of glory, only danger and death to her  lover! Her spirits received a severe shock when the intelligence was  first communicated--she gradually lost her cheerfulness and spirits; the  song, the dance, had no longer charm or interest for her, and she could  only contemplate the approaching separation with sorrow and dismay!    Henri perceived her depression, and endeavoured to combat and remove her  fears by arguments fond, but unavailing. It was only, he would urge, a  jaunt of pleasure; it would admit his speedy return, when he would come  to lay his services at her feet, and claim the hand which was already  promised to his hopes; and surely, then, Rosalie could not regret his  obeying the call of duty and of honour; or like her lover the worse,  when crowned with victory in the cause of his country. To these and  similar assurances, Rosalie could only reply with the mute eloquence of  tears; and nothing could divest her of the apprehension with which she  ever regarded an enterprise which she seemed to consider from the  first as fatal.    The time however drew on, the dreaded period arrived, the Royal Guard  left its quarters, and departed from S----. Henri took a fond and  passionate adieu of his betrothed; and Rosalie, having summoned all her  fortitude to her aid, went through the parting scene with more firmness  than could have been expected from her, though her feelings, afterwards,  were described as of the most agonizing kind.    Such is the difference between the ardent feelings of man, and the  tender and gentle sympathies of woman, that, while his sorrow is  alleviated by a thousand mitigating circumstances of ardour and  excitement, which relieve his attention, and soothe, though they do not  annihilate his grief; she can only brood over her feelings, and suffer  in silence and in sorrow. Henri marched out with his regiment in all the  vigour of manhood, and with all the \"pomp, pride, and circumstance of  war,\" while Rosalie could only retire to her chamber and weep.    Time passed on; letters were received from Henri, which spoke in ardent  terms of his journey, and of the new and singular scenes unfolded to his  view. He adverted also to his return, mentioned the war as a mere  pastime, and as an agreeable jaunt, the termination of which he only  desired, because it would once more restore him to his Rosalie. It was  remarked, however, that she never recovered her cheerfulness; to all her  lover's assurances she could only reply with expressions of distrust,  and with feelings of sorrow; and when she wrote, it was to express her  fears of the campaign, and her wish that it were over, and that they  were again united in safety.    And constantly did the good and pious girl offer up her prayers for her  lover, as she repaired to the church of the Holy Virgin at S----, to  perform her daily devotions.    The season advanced: the French marched through Spain, and reached  Cadiz. At this last hope of the Constitutionalists, a strong resistance  was expected, and Henri had written from Seville, that his next letter  would announce the termination of the campaign. Alas! he never wrote  again! Time flew on; the journals announced the fall of the Trocadero;  the surrender of Cadiz, and the restoration of Ferdinand; yet there came  no news from Henri! Then did the gentle girl sink into all the  despondency of disappointment; and as day after day passed and brought  no tidings of her lover, her beauty and her health suffered alike, she  languished and pined till she scarce retained the semblance of her  former self.    At last came a letter; it was from Spain, but it was written in a  stranger's hand, and its sable appendages bespoke the fatal nature of  its contents. It was from a brother officer of Henri, stating that his  regiment had been foremost in the attack, and that the Trocadero, the  last resource of the Constitutionalists, had been carried with the loss  of but few killed; but, alas! among that few, was Henri! He was shot  through the body while leading his men to the assault. He fell instantly  dead, and the writer expressed his desire that the sad intelligence  should be conveyed as gently as possible to Rosalie.    Unhappily, by one of those chances which often occur, as if to aggravate  misfortune, it was Rosalie who received the fatal letter from the  postman's hands! She tore it open; read its dreadful contents; and with  a wild and frenzied shriek, fell senseless to the ground! She was borne  to her bed, where every care and attention was bestowed; but her illness  rapidly assumed a threatening and a dangerous character. A fever seized  her frame; she became at once delirious; nor did reason again resume her  throne; and it was not till after months of suffering and agony, that  she recovered, if that could be called recovery, which gave back a  deformed and hapless lunatic, bereft of intellect and of beauty, in  place of the once gay and fascinating Rosalie. The dread aberration of  intellect was attributed by her medical attendants to the fatal and  sudden shock which she had sustained, and to its effect on a mind  weakened by previous anxiety and sorrow; while they feared her malady  was of a nature, which admitted no hope of the return of reason.    Her mind, it was stated, remained an entire blank. Imbecile, vacant,  drivelling--she appeared almost unconscious of former existence; and of  those subjects which formerly engrossed her attention, and excited her  feelings, there were scarcely any on which she now evinced any emotion.  Even the name of her lover was almost powerless on her soul, and if  repeated in her hearing, seemed scarcely to call forth her notice.    One only gift remained, in all its native pathos, tenderness, and  beauty--her voice, so sweet before her illness, seemed, amid the wreck  of youth, and joy, and love, and all that was charming and endeared, to  have only become sweeter still! She was incapable or unwilling to learn  any new airs, but she would occasionally recollect snatches of former  songs or duets, which she and Henri had sung together, and she would  pour the simple melodies in strains of more than mortal sweetness!    This, alas! was the only relic of former talent or taste that she  retained; in all other respects, her mind and body, instead of evincing  symptoms of recovery, seemed to sink in utter hopelessness and despair;  and an early tomb seems to be the best and kindest boon which heaven, in  its mercy, can bestow, on the once fair and fascinating Rosalie!    _Tales of all Nations._           *       *       *       *       *      ANECDOTES AND RECOLLECTIONS.
