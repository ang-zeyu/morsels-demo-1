Poor Pontiac! his forebodings were but too just; for when I last  heard from him, he was under the lash of an Ogallalla brave, on a war  party against the Crows.    As it grew dark, and the voices of the whip-poor-wills succeeded the  whistle of the quails, we removed our saddles to the tent, to serve as  pillows, spread our blankets upon the ground, and prepared to bivouac  for the first time that season. Each man selected the place in the  tent which he was to occupy for the journey. To Delorier, however, was  assigned the cart, into which he could creep in wet weather, and find a  much better shelter than his bourgeois enjoyed in the tent.    The river Kansas at this point forms the boundary line between the  country of the Shawanoes and that of the Delawares. We crossed it on  the following day, rafting over our horses and equipage with much  difficulty, and unloading our cart in order to make our way up the steep  ascent on the farther bank. It was a Sunday morning; warm, tranquil and  bright; and a perfect stillness reigned over the rough inclosures  and neglected fields of the Delawares, except the ceaseless hum and  chirruping of myriads of insects. Now and then, an Indian rode past on  his way to the meeting-house, or through the dilapidated entrance of  some shattered log-house an old woman might be discerned, enjoying all  the luxury of idleness. There was no village bell, for the Delawares  have none; and yet upon that forlorn and rude settlement was the same  spirit of Sabbath repose and tranquillity as in some little New England  village among the mountains of New Hampshire or the Vermont woods.    Having at present no leisure for such reflections, we pursued our  journey. A military road led from this point to Fort Leavenworth, and  for many miles the farms and cabins of the Delawares were scattered  at short intervals on either hand. The little rude structures of logs,  erected usually on the borders of a tract of woods, made a picturesque  feature in the landscape. But the scenery needed no foreign aid. Nature  had done enough for it; and the alteration of rich green prairies and  groves that stood in clusters or lined the banks of the numerous little  streams, had all the softened and polished beauty of a region that has  been for centuries under the hand of man. At that early season, too,  it was in the height of its freshness and luxuriance. The woods were  flushed with the red buds of the maple; there were frequent flowering  shrubs unknown in the east; and the green swells of the prairies were  thickly studded with blossoms.    Encamping near a spring by the side of a hill, we resumed our journey in  the morning, and early in the afternoon had arrived within a few miles  of Fort Leavenworth. The road crossed a stream densely bordered with  trees, and running in the bottom of a deep woody hollow. We were about  to descend into it, when a wild and confused procession appeared,  passing through the water below, and coming up the steep ascent toward  us. We stopped to let them pass. They were Delawares, just returned  from a hunting expedition. All, both men and women, were mounted on  horseback, and drove along with them a considerable number of pack  mules, laden with the furs they had taken, together with the buffalo  robes, kettles, and other articles of their traveling equipment, which  as well as their clothing and their weapons, had a worn and dingy  aspect, as if they had seen hard service of late. At the rear of the  party was an old man, who, as he came up, stopped his horse to speak to  us. He rode a little tough shaggy pony, with mane and tail well knotted  with burrs, and a rusty Spanish bit in its mouth, to which, by way of  reins, was attached a string of raw hide. His saddle, robbed probably  from a Mexican, had no covering, being merely a tree of the Spanish  form, with a piece of grizzly bear's skin laid over it, a pair of rude  wooden stirrups attached, and in the absence of girth, a thong of hide  passing around the horse's belly. The rider's dark features and keen  snaky eyes were unequivocally Indian. He wore a buckskin frock, which,  like his fringed leggings, was well polished and blackened by grease and  long service; and an old handkerchief was tied around his head. Resting  on the saddle before him lay his rifle; a weapon in the use of which  the Delawares are skillful; though from its weight, the distant prairie  Indians are too lazy to carry it.    \"Who's your chief?\" he immediately inquired.    Henry Chatillon pointed to us. The old Delaware fixed his eyes intently  upon us for a moment, and then sententiously remarked:    \"No good! Too young!\" With this flattering comment he left us, and rode  after his people.    This tribe, the Delawares, once the peaceful allies of William Penn, the  tributaries of the conquering Iroquois, are now the most adventurous and  dreaded warriors upon the prairies. They make war upon remote tribes the  very names of which were unknown to their fathers in their ancient  seats in Pennsylvania; and they push these new quarrels with true  Indian rancor, sending out their little war parties as far as the Rocky  Mountains, and into the Mexican territories. Their neighbors and  former confederates, the Shawanoes, who are tolerable farmers, are in  a prosperous condition; but the Delawares dwindle every year, from the  number of men lost in their warlike expeditions.    Soon after leaving this party, we saw, stretching on the right, the  forests that follow the course of the Missouri, and the deep woody  channel through which at this point it runs. At a distance in front were  the white barracks of Fort Leavenworth, just visible through the trees  upon an eminence above a bend of the river. A wide green meadow, as  level as a lake, lay between us and the Missouri, and upon this, close  to a line of trees that bordered a little brook, stood the tent of the  captain and his companions, with their horses feeding around it, but  they themselves were invisible. Wright, their muleteer, was there,  seated on the tongue of the wagon, repairing his harness. Boisverd  stood cleaning his rifle at the door of the tent, and Sorel lounged  idly about. On closer examination, however, we discovered the captain's  brother, Jack, sitting in the tent, at his old occupation of splicing  trail-ropes. He welcomed us in his broad Irish brogue, and said that  his brother was fishing in the river, and R. gone to the garrison. They  returned before sunset. Meanwhile we erected our own tent not far off,  and after supper a council was held, in which it was resolved to remain  one day at Fort Leavenworth, and on the next to bid a final adieu to  the frontier: or in the phraseology of the region, to \"jump off.\" Our  deliberations were conducted by the ruddy light from a distant swell of  the prairie, where the long dry grass of last summer was on fire.        CHAPTER III    FORT LEAVENWORTH      On the next morning we rode to Fort Leavenworth. Colonel, now General,  Kearny, to whom I had had the honor of an introduction when at St.  Louis, was just arrived, and received us at his headquarters with the  high-bred courtesy habitual to him. Fort Leavenworth is in fact no fort,  being without defensive works, except two block-houses. No rumors of  war had as yet disturbed its tranquillity. In the square grassy area,  surrounded by barracks and the quarters of the officers, the men were  passing and repassing, or lounging among the trees; although not many  weeks afterward it presented a different scene; for here the very  off-scourings of the frontier were congregated, to be marshaled for the  expedition against Santa Fe.    Passing through the garrison, we rode toward the Kickapoo village, five  or six miles beyond. The path, a rather dubious and uncertain one, led  us along the ridge of high bluffs that bordered the Missouri; and by  looking to the right or to the left, we could enjoy a strange contrast  of opposite scenery. On the left stretched the prairie, rising into  swells and undulations, thickly sprinkled with groves, or gracefully  expanding into wide grassy basins of miles in extent; while its  curvatures, swelling against the horizon, were often surmounted by lines  of sunny woods; a scene to which the freshness of the season and the  peculiar mellowness of the atmosphere gave additional softness. Below  us, on the right, was a tract of ragged and broken woods. We could look  down on the summits of the trees, some living and some dead; some erect,  others leaning at every angle, and others still piled in masses together  by the passage of a hurricane. Beyond their extreme verge, the turbid  waters of the Missouri were discernible through the boughs, rolling  powerfully along at the foot of the woody declivities of its farther  bank.    The path soon after led inland; and as we crossed an open meadow we saw  a cluster of buildings on a rising ground before us, with a crowd of  people surrounding them. They were the storehouse, cottage, and stables  of the Kickapoo trader's establishment. Just at that moment, as it  chanced, he was beset with half the Indians of the settlement. They had  tied their wretched, neglected little ponies by dozens along the fences  and outhouses, and were either lounging about the place, or crowding  into the trading house. Here were faces of various colors; red, green,  white, and black, curiously intermingled and disposed over the visage  in a variety of patterns. Calico shirts, red and blue blankets, brass  ear-rings, wampum necklaces, appeared in profusion. The trader was a  blue-eyed open-faced man who neither in his manners nor his appearance  betrayed any of the roughness of the frontier; though just at present he  was obliged to keep a lynx eye on his suspicious customers, who, men  and women, were climbing on his counter and seating themselves among his  boxes and bales.    The village"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#4)"],[1,"civilization of the great nations  of that time, that all life was theoretically justified by representing  it as the application of minute laws supposed to have been elaborated by  Mohammed by precept and example.    Thus tradition gives invaluable material for the knowledge of the conflict  of opinions in the first centuries, a strife the sharpness of which has  been blunted in later times by a most resourceful harmonistic method. But,  it is vain to endeavour to construct the life and teaching of Mohammed from  such spurious accounts; they cannot even afford us a reliable illustration  of his life in the form of \"table talk,\" as an English scholar rather  naively tried to derive from them. In a collection of this sort, supported  by good external evidence, there would be attributed to the Prophet of  Mecca sayings from the Old and New Testament, wise saws from classical and  Arabian antiquity, prescriptions of Roman law and many other things, each  text of which was as authentic as its fellows.    Anyone who, warned by Goldziher and others, has realized how matters stand  in this respect, will be careful not to take the legislative tradition as  a direct instrument for the explanation of the Qoran. When, after a most  careful investigation of thousands of traditions which all appear equally  old, we have selected the oldest, then we shall see that we have before us  only witnesses of the first century of the Hijrah. The connecting threads  with the time of Mohammed must be supplied for a great part by imagination.    The historical or biographical tradition in the proper sense of the word  has only lately been submitted to a keener examination. It was known for a  long time that here too, besides theological and legendary elements,  there were traditions originating from party motive, intended to give an  appearance of historical foundation to the particular interests of certain  persons or families; but it was thought that after some sifting there yet  remained enough to enable us to form a much clearer sketch of Mohammed's  life than that of any other of the founders of a universal religion.    It is especially Prince Caetani and Father Lammens who have disturbed this  illusion. According to them, even the data which had been pretty generally  regarded as objective, rest chiefly upon tendentious fiction. The  generations that worked at the biography of the Prophet were too far  removed from his time to have true data or notions; and, moreover, it was  not their aim to know the past as it was, but to construct a picture of it  as it ought to have been according to their opinion. Upon the bare canvass  of verses of the Qoran that need explanation, the traditionists have  embroidered with great boldness scenes suitable to the desires or ideals of  their particular group; or, to use a favourite metaphor of Lammens, they  fill the empty spaces by a process of stereotyping which permits the  critical observer to recognize the origin of each picture. In the Sirah  (biography), the distance of the first describers from their object is the  same as in the Hadith (legislative tradition); in both we get images of  very distant things, perceived by means of fancy rather than by sight and  taking different shapes according to the inclinations of each circle of  describers.    Now, it may be true that the latest judges have here and there examined the  Mohammedan traditions too sceptically and too suspiciously; nevertheless,  it remains certain that in the light of their research, the method of  examination cannot remain unchanged. We must endeavour to make our  explanations of the Qoran independent of tradition, and in respect to  portions where this is impossible, we must be suspicious of explanations,  however apparently plausible.    During the last few years the accessible sources of information have  considerably increased, the study of them has become much deeper and more  methodical, and the result is that we can tell much less about the teaching  and the life of Mohammed than could our predecessors half a century ago.  This apparent loss is of course in reality nothing but gain.    Those who do not take part in new discoveries, nevertheless, wish to know  now and then the results of the observations made with constantly improved  instruments. Let me endeavour, very briefly, to satisfy this curiosity.  That the report of the bookkeeping might make a somewhat different  impression if another accountant had examined it, goes without saying, and  sometimes I shall draw particular attention to my personal responsibility  in this respect.    Of Mohammed's life before his appearance as the messenger of God, we know  extremely little; compared to the legendary biography as treasured by the  Faithful, practically nothing. Not to mention his pre-existence as a Light,  which was with God, and for the sake of which God created the world, the  Light, which as the principle of revelation, lived in all prophets from  Adam onwards, and the final revelation of which in Mohammed was prophesied  in the Scriptures of the Jews and the Christians; not to mention the  wonderful and mysterious signs which announced the birth of the Seal of the  Prophets, and many other features which the later Sirahs (biographies) and  Maulids (pious histories of his birth, most in rhymed prose or in poetic  metre) produce in imitation of the Gospels; even the elaborate discourses  of the older biographies on occurrences, which in themselves might quite  well come within the limits of sub-lunary possibility, do not belong to  history. Fiction plays such a great part in these stories, that we are  never sure of being on historical ground unless the Qoran gives us a firm  footing.    The question, whether the family to which Mohammed belonged, was regarded  as noble amongst the Qoraishites, the ruling tribe in Mecca, is answered  in the affirmative by many; but by others this answer is questioned not  without good grounds. The matter is not of prime importance, as there is no  doubt that Mohammed grew up as a poor orphan and belonged to the needy and  the neglected. Even a long time after his first appearance the unbelievers  reproached him, according to the Qoran, with his insignificant worldly  position, which fitted ill with a heavenly message; the same scornful  reproach according to the Qoran was hurled at Mohammed's predecessors by  sceptics of earlier generations; and it is well known that the stories  of older times in the Qoran are principally reflections of what Mohammed  himself experienced. The legends of Mohammed's relations to various members  of his family are too closely connected with the pretensions of their  descendants to have any value for biographic purposes. He married late an  elderly woman, who, it is said, was able to lighten his material cares; she  gave him the only daughter by whom he had descendants; descendants, who,  from the Arabian point of view, do not count as such, as according to their  genealogical theories the line of descent cannot pass through a woman.  They have made an exception for the Prophet, as male offspring, the only  blessing of marriage appreciated by Arabs, was withheld from him.    In the materialistic commercial town of Mecca, where lust of gain and usury  reigned supreme, where women, wine, and gambling filled up the leisure  time, where might was right, and widows, orphans, and the feeble were  treated as superfluous ballast, an unfortunate being like Mohammed, if his  constitution were sensitive, must have experienced most painful emotions.  In the intellectual advantages that the place offered he could find  no solace; the highly developed Arabian art of words, poetry with its  fictitious amourettes, its polished descriptions of portions of Arabian  nature, its venal vain praise and satire, might serve as dessert to a  well-filled dish; they were unable to compensate for the lack of material  prosperity. Mohammed felt his misery as a pain too great to be endured; in  some way or other he must be delivered from it. He desired to be more than  the greatest in his surroundings, and he knew that in that which they  counted for happiness he could never even equal them. Rather than envy them  regretfully, he preferred to despise their values of life, but on that very  account he had to oppose these values with better ones.    It was not unknown in Mecca that elsewhere communities existed acquainted  with such high ideals of life, spiritual goods accessible to the poor, even  to them in particular. Apart from commerce, which brought the inhabitants  of Mecca into contact with Abyssinians, Syrians, and others, there were far  to the south and less far to the north and north-east of Mecca, Arabian  tribes who had embraced the Jewish or the Christian religion. Perhaps this  circumstance had helped to make the inhabitants of Mecca familiar with the  idea of a creator, Allah, but this had little significance in their lives,  as in the Maker of the Universe they did not see their Lawgiver and judge,  but held themselves dependent for their good and evil fortune upon all  manner of beings, which they rendered favourable or harmless by animistic  practices. Thoroughly conservative, they did not take great interest in  the conceptions of the \"People of the Scripture,\" as they called the Jews,  Christians, and perhaps some other sects arisen from these communities.    But Mohammed's deeply felt misery awakened his interest in them. Whether  this had been the case with a few others before him in the milieu of Mecca,  we need not consider, as it does not help to explain his actions. If wide  circles had been anxious to know more about the contents of the \"Scripture\"  Mohammed would not have felt in the dark in the way that he did. We shall  probably never know, by intercourse with whom it really was that Mohammed  at last gained some knowledge of the contents of the sacred books of  Judaism and"]]]
