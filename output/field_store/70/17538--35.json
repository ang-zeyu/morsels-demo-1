To call conduct three-fourths of  life, with Matthew Arnold; to describe man as one-third intellect and  two-thirds will, with Schopenhauer; to urge that man is what he does  or that he is the sum of his movements, with F.W. Robertson; that  character is simply muscle habits, with Maudsley; that the age of art  is now slowly superseding the age of science, and that the artist will  drive out with the professor, with the anonymous author of \"Rembrandt  als Erzicher\";[1] that history is consciously willed movements, with  Bluntschli; or that we could form no conception of force or energy in  the world but for our own muscular effort; to hold that most thought  involves change of muscle tension as more or less integral to it--all  this shows how we have modified the antique Ciceronian conception  _vivere est cogitari_, [To live is to think] to _vivere est velle_,  [To live is to will] and gives us a new sense of the importance of  muscular development and regimen.[2]    Modern psychology thus sees in muscles organs of expression for all  efferent processes. Beyond all their demonstrable functions, every  change of attention and of psychic states generally plays upon them  unconsciously, modifying their tension in subtle ways so that they may  be called organs of thought and feeling as well as of will, in which  some now see the true Kantian thing-in-itself the real substance of  the world, in the anthropomorphism of force. Habits even determine the  deeper strata of belief; thought is repressed action; and deeds, not  words, are the language of complete men. The motor areas are closely  related and largely identical with the psychic, and muscle culture  develops brain-centers as nothing else yet demonstrably does. Muscles  are the vehicles of habituation, imitation, obedience, character, and  even of manners and customs. For the young, motor education is  cardinal, and is now coming to due recognition; and, for all,  education is incomplete without a motor side. Skill, endurance, and  perseverance may almost be called muscular virtues; and fatigue,  velleity, caprice, _ennui_, restlessness, lack of control and poise,  muscular faults.    To understand the momentous changes of motor functions that  characterize adolescence we must consider other than the measurable  aspects of the subject. Perhaps the best scale on which to measure all  normal growth of muscle structure and functions is found in the  progress from fundamental to accessory. The former designates the  muscles and movements of the trunk and large joints, neck, back, hips,  shoulders, knees, and elbows, sometimes called central, and which in  general man has in common with the higher and larger animals. Their  activities are few, mostly simultaneous, alternating and rhythmic, as  of the legs in walking, and predominate in hard-working men and women  with little culture or intelligence, and often in idiots. The latter  or accessory movements are those of the hand, tongue, face, and  articulatory organs, and these may be connected into a long and  greatly diversified series, as those used in writing, talking,  piano-playing. They are represented by smaller and more numerous  muscles, whose functions develop later in life and represent a higher  standpoint of evolution. These smaller muscles for finer movements  come into function later and are chiefly associated with psychic  activity, which plays upon them by incessantly changing their  tensions, if not causing actual movement. It is these that are so  liable to disorder in the many automatisms and choreic tics we see in  school children, especially if excited or fatigued. General paralysis  usually begins in the higher levels by breaking these down, so that  the first symptom of its insidious and never interrupted progress is  inability to execute the more exact and delicate movements of tongue  or hand, or both. Starting with the latest evolutionary level, it is a  devolution that may work downward till very many of the fundamental  activities are lost before death.    Nothing better illustrates this distinction than the difference  between the fore foot of animals and the human hand. The first begins  as a fin or paddle or is armed with a hoof, and is used solely for  locomotion. Some carnivora with claws use the fore limb also for  holding well as tearing, and others for digging. Arboreal life seems  to have almost created the simian hand and to have wrought a  revolution in the form and use of the forearm and its accessory  organs, the fingers. Apes and other tree-climbing creatures must not  only adjust their prehensile organ to a wide variety of distances and  sizes of branches, but must use the hands more or less freely for  picking, transporting, and eating fruit; and this has probably been a  prime factor in lifting man to the erect position, without which human  intelligence as we know it could have hardly been possible. \"When we  attempt to measure the gap between man and the lower animals in terms  of the form of movement, the wonder is no less great than when we use  the term of mentality.\"[3] The degree of approximation to human  intelligence in anthropoid animals follows very closely the degree of  approximation to human movements.    The gradual acquirement of the erect position by the human infant  admirably repeats this long phylogenetic evolution.[4] At first the  limbs are of almost no use in locomotion, but the fundamental trunk  muscles with those that move the large joints are more or less  spasmodically active. Then comes creeping, with use of the hip  muscles, while all below the knee is useless, as also are the fingers.  Slowly the leg and foot are degraded to locomotion, slowly the great  toe becomes more limited in its action, the thumb increases in  flexibility and strength of opposition, and the fingers grow more  mobile and controllable. As the body slowly assumes the vertical  attitude, the form of the chest changes till its greatest diameter is  transverse instead of from front to back. The shoulder-blades are less  parallel than in quadrupeds, and spread out till they approximate the  same plane. This gives the arm freedom of movement laterally, so that  it can be rotated one hundred and eighty degrees in man as contrasted  to one hundred degrees in apes, thus giving man the command of almost  any point within a sphere of which the two arms are radii. The power  of grasping was partly developed from and partly added to the old  locomotor function of the fore limbs; the jerky aimless automatisms,  as well as the slow rhythmic flexion and extension of the fingers and  hand, movements which are perhaps survivals of arboreal or of even  earlier aquatic life, are coordinated; and the bilateral and  simultaneous rhythmic movements of the heavier muscles are  supplemented by the more finely adjusted and specialized activities  which as the end of the growth period is approached are determined  less by heredity and more by environment. In a sense, a child or a man  is the sum total of his movements or tendencies to move; and nature  and instinct chiefly determine the basal, and education the accessory  parts of our activities.    The entire accessory system is thus of vital importance for the  development of all of the arts of expression. These smaller muscles  might almost be called organs of thought. Their tension is modified  with the faintest change of soul, such as is seen in accent,  inflection, facial expressions, handwriting, and many forms of  so-called mind-reading, which, in fact, is always muscle-reading. The  day-laborer of low intelligence, with a practical vocabulary of not  over five hundred words, who can hardly move each of his fingers  without moving others or all of them, who can not move his brows or  corrugate his forehead at will, and whose inflection is very  monotonous, illustrates a condition of arrest or atrophy of this  later, finer, accessory system of muscles. On the other hand, the  child, precocious in any or all of these later respects, is very  liable to be undeveloped in the larger and more fundamental parts and  functions. The full unfoldment of each is, in fact, an inexorable  condition precedent for the normal development to full and abiding  maturity of the higher and more refined muscularity, just as  conversely the awkwardness and clumsiness of adolescence mark a  temporary loss of balance in the opposite direction. If this general  conception be correct, then nature does not finish the basis of her  pyramid in the way Ross, Mercier, and others have assumed, but lays a  part of the foundation and, after carrying it to an apex, normally  goes back and adds to the foundation to carry up the apex still higher  and, if prevented from so doing, expends her energy in building the  apex up at a sharper angle till instability results. School and  kindergarten often lay a disproportionate strain on the tiny accessory  muscles, weighing altogether but a few ounces, that wag the tongue,  move the pen, and do fine work requiring accuracy. But still at this  stage prolonged work requiring great accuracy is irksome and brings  dangers homologous to those caused by too much fine work in the  kindergarten before the first adjustment of large to small muscles,  which lasts until adolescence, is established. Then disproportion  between function and growth often causes symptoms of chorea. The chief  danger is arrest of the development and control of the smaller  muscles. Many occupations and forms of athletics, on the contrary,  place the stress mainly upon groups of fundamental muscles to the  neglect of finer motor possibilities. Some who excel in heavy  athletics no doubt coarsen their motor reactions, become not only  inexact and heavy but unresponsive to finer stimuli, as if the large  muscles were hypertrophied and the small ones arrested.

It was a woman's love which kept  Tarzan even to the semblance of civilization--a condition for which  familiarity had bred contempt.  He hated the shams and the hypocrisies  of it and with the clear vision of an unspoiled mind he had penetrated  to the rotten core of the heart of the thing--the cowardly greed for  peace and ease and the safe-guarding of property rights.  That the fine  things of life--art, music and literature--had thriven upon such  enervating ideals he strenuously denied, insisting, rather, that they  had endured in spite of civilization.    \"Show me the fat, opulent coward,\" he was wont to say, \"who ever  originated a beautiful ideal.  In the clash of arms, in the battle for  survival, amid hunger and death and danger, in the face of God as  manifested in the display of Nature's most terrific forces, is born all  that is finest and best in the human heart and mind.\"    And so Tarzan always came back to Nature in the spirit of a lover  keeping a long deferred tryst after a period behind prison walls.  His  Waziri, at marrow, were more civilized than he.  They cooked their meat  before they ate it and they shunned many articles of food as unclean  that Tarzan had eaten with gusto all his life and so insidious is the  virus of hypocrisy that even the stalwart ape-man hesitated to give  rein to his natural longings before them.  He ate burnt flesh when he  would have preferred it raw and unspoiled, and he brought down game  with arrow or spear when he would far rather have leaped upon it from  ambush and sunk his strong teeth in its jugular; but at last the call  of the milk of the savage mother that had suckled him in infancy rose  to an insistent demand--he craved the hot blood of a fresh kill and his  muscles yearned to pit themselves against the savage jungle in the  battle for existence that had been his sole birthright for the first  twenty years of his life.          3    The Call of the Jungle      Moved by these vague yet all-powerful urgings the ape-man lay awake one  night in the little thorn boma that protected, in a way, his party from  the depredations of the great carnivora of the jungle.  A single  warrior stood sleepy guard beside the fire that yellow eyes out of the  darkness beyond the camp made imperative.  The moans and the coughing  of the big cats mingled with the myriad noises of the lesser denizens  of the jungle to fan the savage flame in the breast of this savage  English lord.  He tossed upon his bed of grasses, sleepless, for an  hour and then he rose, noiseless as a wraith, and while the Waziri's  back was turned, vaulted the boma wall in the face of the flaming eyes,  swung silently into a great tree and was gone.    For a time in sheer exuberance of animal spirit he raced swiftly  through the middle terrace, swinging perilously across wide spans from  one jungle giant to the next, and then he clambered upward to the  swaying, lesser boughs of the upper terrace where the moon shone full  upon him and the air was stirred by little breezes and death lurked  ready in each frail branch.  Here he paused and raised his face to  Goro, the moon.  With uplifted arm he stood, the cry of the bull ape  quivering upon his lips, yet he remained silent lest he arouse his  faithful Waziri who were all too familiar with the hideous challenge of  their master.    And then he went on more slowly and with greater stealth and caution,  for now Tarzan of the Apes was seeking a kill.  Down to the ground he  came in the utter blackness of the close-set boles and the overhanging  verdure of the jungle. He stooped from time to time and put his nose  close to earth.  He sought and found a wide game trail and at last his  nostrils were rewarded with the scent of the fresh spoor of Bara, the  deer.  Tarzan's mouth watered and a low growl escaped his patrician  lips.  Sloughed from him was the last vestige of artificial caste--once  again he was the primeval hunter--the first man--the highest caste type  of the human race.  Up wind he followed the elusive spoor with a sense  of perception so transcending that of ordinary man as to be  inconceivable to us.  Through counter currents of the heavy stench of  meat eaters he traced the trail of Bara; the sweet and cloying stink of  Horta, the boar, could not drown his quarry's scent--the permeating,  mellow musk of the deer's foot.    Presently the body scent of the deer told Tarzan that his prey was  close at hand.  It sent him into the trees again--into the lower  terrace where he could watch the ground below and catch with ears and  nose the first intimation of actual contact with his quarry.  Nor was  it long before the ape-man came upon Bara standing alert at the edge of  a moon-bathed clearing.  Noiselessly Tarzan crept through the trees  until he was directly over the deer.  In the ape-man's right hand was  the long hunting knife of his father and in his heart the blood lust of  the carnivore.  Just for an instant he poised above the unsuspecting  Bara and then he launched himself downward upon the sleek back.  The  impact of his weight carried the deer to its knees and before the  animal could regain its feet the knife had found its heart.  As Tarzan  rose upon the body of his kill to scream forth his hideous victory cry  into the face of the moon the wind carried to his nostrils something  which froze him to statuesque immobility and silence.  His savage eyes  blazed into the direction from which the wind had borne down the  warning to him and a moment later the grasses at one side of the  clearing parted and Numa, the lion, strode majestically into view.  His  yellow-green eyes were fastened upon Tarzan as he halted just within  the clearing and glared enviously at the successful hunter, for Numa  had had no luck this night.    From the lips of the ape-man broke a rumbling growl of warning.  Numa  answered but he did not advance.  Instead he stood waving his tail  gently to and fro, and presently Tarzan squatted upon his kill and cut  a generous portion from a hind quarter.  Numa eyed him with growing  resentment and rage as, between mouthfuls, the ape-man growled out his  savage warnings.  Now this particular lion had never before come in  contact with Tarzan of the Apes and he was much mystified.  Here was  the appearance and the scent of a man-thing and Numa had tasted of  human flesh and learned that though not the most palatable it was  certainly by far the easiest to secure, yet there was that in the  bestial growls of the strange creature which reminded him of formidable  antagonists and gave him pause, while his hunger and the odor of the  hot flesh of Bara goaded him almost to madness.  Always Tarzan watched  him, guessing what was passing in the little brain of the carnivore and  well it was that he did watch him, for at last Numa could stand it no  longer.  His tail shot suddenly erect and at the same instant the wary  ape-man, knowing all too well what the signal portended, grasped the  remainder of the deer's hind quarter between his teeth and leaped into  a nearby tree as Numa charged him with all the speed and a sufficient  semblance of the weight of an express train.    Tarzan's retreat was no indication that he felt fear.  Jungle life is  ordered along different lines than ours and different standards  prevail.  Had Tarzan been famished he would, doubtless, have stood his  ground and met the lion's charge.  He had done the thing before upon  more than one occasion, just as in the past he had charged lions  himself; but tonight he was far from famished and in the hind quarter  he had carried off with him was more raw flesh than he could eat; yet  it was with no equanimity that he looked down upon Numa rending the  flesh of Tarzan's kill.  The presumption of this strange Numa must be  punished!  And forthwith Tarzan set out to make life miserable for the  big cat.  Close by were many trees bearing large, hard fruits and to  one of these the ape-man swung with the agility of a squirrel.  Then  commenced a bombardment which brought forth earthshaking roars from  Numa.  One after another as rapidly as he could gather and hurl them,  Tarzan pelted the hard fruit down upon the lion.  It was impossible for  the tawny cat to eat under that hail of missiles--he could but roar and  growl and dodge and eventually he was driven away entirely from the  carcass of Bara, the deer.  He went roaring and resentful; but in the  very center of the clearing his voice was suddenly hushed and Tarzan  saw the great head lower and flatten out, the body crouch and the long  tail quiver, as the beast slunk cautiously toward the trees upon the  opposite side.    Immediately Tarzan was alert.  He lifted his head and sniffed the slow,  jungle breeze.  What was it that had attracted Numa's attention and  taken him soft-footed and silent away from the scene of his  discomfiture?  Just as the lion disappeared among the trees beyond the  clearing Tarzan caught upon the down-coming wind the explanation of his  new interest--the scent spoor of man was wafted strongly to the  sensitive nostrils.  Caching the remainder of the deer's hind quarter  in the crotch of a tree the ape-man wiped his greasy palms upon his  naked thighs and swung off in pursuit of Numa.  A broad, well-beaten  elephant path led into the forest from the clearing.  Parallel to this  slunk Numa, while above him Tarzan moved through the trees, the shadow  of a wraith.  The savage cat and the savage man saw Numa's quarry  almost simultaneously, though both had known before it came within the  vision of their eyes that it was a black man.  Their sensitive nostrils  had told them this much and Tarzan's had told him that the scent spoor  was that of a stranger--old and a male, for race and sex and age each  has its own distinctive scent.  It was an old man that made his way  alone through the gloomy jungle, a wrinkled, dried up, little old man  hideously scarred and tattooed"]]]
