Love,  according to Hindu notions, is the subject of most of their dramas.    The hero, who is generally a king, and already the husband of a wife  or wives (for a wife or two more or less is no encumbrance in Indian  plays), is suddenly smitten with the charms of a lovely woman,  sometimes a nymph, or, as in the case of [S']akoontala, the daughter of a  nymph by a mortal father. The heroine is required to be equally  impressible, and the first tender glance from the hero's eye reaches  her heart. With true feminine delicacy, however, she locks the secret  of her passion in her own breast, and by her coyness and reserve keeps  her lover for a long period in the agonies of suspense. The hero,  being reduced to a proper state of desperation, is harassed by other  difficulties. Either the celestial nature of the nymph is in the way  of their union, or he doubts the legality of the match, or he his own  unworthiness, or he is hampered by the angry jealousy of a previous  wife. In short, doubts, obstacles, and delays make great havoc of both  hero and heroine. They give way to melancholy, indulge in amorous  rhapsodies, and become very emaciated. So far, it must be confessed,  the story is decidedly dull, and its pathos, notwithstanding the  occasional grandeur and beauty of the imagery, often verges on the  ridiculous.    But, by way of relief, an element of life is generally introduced in  the character of the Vidushaka, or Jester, who is the constant  companion of the hero; and in the young maidens, who are the  confidential friends of the heroine, and soon become possessed of her  secret. By a curious regulation, the Jester is always a Brahman, and  therefore of a caste superior to the king himself; yet his business is  to excite mirth by being ridiculous in person, age, and attire. He is  sometimes represented as grey-haired, hump-backed, lame, and ugly. In  fact, he is a species of buffoon, who is allowed full liberty of  speech, being himself a universal butt. His attempts at wit, which are  rarely very successful, and his allusions to the pleasures of the  table, of which he is a confessed votary, are absurdly contrasted with  the sententious solemnity of the despairing hero, crossed in the  prosecution of his love-suit. His clumsy interference in the intrigues  of his friend only serves to augment his difficulties, and occasions  many an awkward dilemma. On the other hand, the shrewdness of the  heroine's confidantes never seems to fail them under the most trying  circumstances; while their sly jokes and innuendos, their love of fun,  their girlish sympathy with the progress of the love affair, their  warm affection for their friend, heighten the interest of the plot,  and contribute not a little to vary its monotony.    Fortunately, in the '[S']akoontala' the story is diversified and the  interest well sustained by a chain of stirring incidents. The first  link of the chain, however, does not commence until the Fourth Act,  when the union of the heroine with King Dushyanta, and her acceptance  of the marriage-ring as a token of recognition, are supposed to have  taken place. Then follows the King's departure and temporary desertion  of his bride; the curse pronounced on [S']akoontala by the choleric Sage;  the monarch's consequent loss of memory; the bride's journey to the  palace of her husband; the mysterious disappearance of the  marriage-token; the public repudiation of [S']akoontala; her miraculous  assumption to a celestial asylum; the unexpected discovery of the ring  by a poor fisherman; the King's agony on recovering his recollection;  his aerial voyage in the car of Indra; his strange meeting with the  refractory child in the groves of Kasyapa; the boy's battle with the  young lion; the search for the amulet, by which the King is proved to  be his father; the return of [S']akoontala, and the happy reunion of the  lovers;--all these form a connected series of moving and interesting  incidents. The feelings of the audience are wrought up to a pitch of  great intensity; and whatever emotions of terror, grief, or pity may  have been excited, are properly tranquillized by the happy termination  of the story.    Indeed, if a calamitous conclusion be necessary to constitute a  tragedy, the Hindu dramas are never tragedies. They are mixed  compositions, in which joy and sorrow, happiness and misery, are woven  in a mingled web--tragi-comic representations, in which good and evil,  right and wrong, truth and falsehood, are allowed to blend in  confusion during the first Acts of the drama. But, in the last Act,  harmony is always restored, order succeeds to disorder, tranquillity  to agitation; and the mind of the spectator, no longer perplexed by  the apparent ascendency of evil, is soothed, and purified, and made to  acquiesce in the moral lesson deducible from the plot.    The play of '[S']akoontala,' as Sir W. Jones observes, must have been  very popular when it was first performed. The Indian empire was then  in its palmy days, and the vanity of the natives would be flattered by  the introduction of those kings and heroes who were supposed to have  laid the foundation of its greatness and magnificence, and whose were  connected with all that was sacred and holy in their religion,  Dushyanta, the hero of the drama, according to Indian legends, was one  of the descendants of the Moon, or in other words, belonged to the  Lunar dynasty of Indian princes; and, if any dependence may be placed  on Hindu chronology, he must have lived in the twenty-first or  twenty-second generation after the Flood. Puru, his most celebrated  ancestor, was the sixth in descent from the Moon's son Budha, who  married a daughter of the good King Satya-vrata, preserved by Vishnu  in the Ark at the time of the Deluge. The son of Dushyanta, by  [S']akoontala, was Bharata, from whom India is still called by the  natives Bharata-varsha. After him came Samvarana, Kuru, Santanu,  Bhishma, and Vyasa. The latter was the father of Dhritarashtra and  Pandu, the quarrels of whose sons form the subject of the great  Sanskrit epic poem called Maha-bharata, a poem with parts of which the  audience would be familiar, and in which they would feel the greatest  pride. Indeed the whole story of [S']akoontala is told in the  Maha-bharata. The pedigree of [S']akoontala, the heroine of the drama,  was no less interesting, and calculated to awaken the religious  sympathies of Indian spectators. She was the daughter of the  celebrated Vi[s']wamitra, a name associated with many remarkable  circumstances in Hindu mythology and history. His genealogy and the  principal events of his life are narrated in the Ramayana, the first  of the two epic poems which were to the Hindus what the Iliad and the  Odyssey were to the Greeks. He was originally of the regal caste; and,  having raised himself to the rank of a Brahman by the length and  rigour of his penance, he became the preceptor of Ramachandra, who  was the hero of the Ramayana, and one of the incarnations of the god  Vishnu. With such an antecedent interest in the particulars of the  story, the audience could not fail to bring a sharpened appetite, and  a self-satisfied frame of mind, to the performance of the play.    Although in the following translation it has been thought expedient to  conform to modern usage, by indicating at the head of each Act the  scene in which it is laid, yet it is proper to apprise the English  reader that in scenery and scenic apparatus the Hindu drama, must have  been very defective. No directions as to changes of scene are given in  the original text of the play. This is the more curious, as there are  numerous stage directions, which prove that in respect of dresses and  decorations the resources of the Indian theatre were sufficiently  ample.    It is probable that a curtain suspended across the stage, and divided  in the centre, answered all the purposes of scenes. Behind the curtain  was the space or room called _nepathya_, where the decorations were  kept, where the actors attired themselves, and remained in readiness  before entering the stage, and whither they withdrew on leaving it.  When an actor was to enter hurriedly, he was directed to do so 'with a  toss of the curtain.'    The machinery and paraphernalia of the Indian theatre were also very  limited, contrasting in this respect unfavourably with the ancient  Greek theatre, which appears to have comprehended nearly all that  modern ingenuity has devised. Nevertheless, seats, thrones, weapons,  and chariots, were certainly introduced, and as the intercourse  between the inhabitants of heaven and earth was very frequent, it is  not improbable that there may have been aerial contrivances to  represent the chariots of celestial beings, as on the Greek stage. It  is plain, however, from the frequent occurrence of the word  _natayitwa_, 'gesticulating,' 'acting,' that much had to be supplied  by the imagination of the spectator, assisted by the gesticulations of  the actors.    For further information relative to the dramatic system of the Hindus,  the reader is referred to the notes appended to the present  translation. It is hoped that they will be found sufficient to explain  every allusion that might otherwise be unintelligible to the English  reader.    MONIER MONIER-WILLIAMS.

Now, what else can it be? You were speaking of congestion of the brain.\"    \"Yes. But the objection to that is the very complete recovery that seems  to take place in the intervals.\"    \"I would not say very complete,\" said Mr. Weiss. \"The recovery is rather  comparative. He is lucid and fairly natural in his manner, but he is  still dull and lethargic. He does not, for instance, show any desire to  go out, or even to leave his room.\"    I pondered uncomfortably on these rather contradictory statements.  Clearly Mr. Weiss did not mean to entertain the theory of opium  poisoning; which was natural enough if he had no knowledge of the drug  having been used. But still--    \"I suppose,\" said Mr. Weiss, \"you have experience of sleeping sickness?\"    The suggestion startled me. I had not. Very few people had. At that time  practically nothing was known about the disease. It was a mere  pathological curiosity, almost unheard of excepting by a few  practitioners in remote parts of Africa, and hardly referred to in the  text-books. Its connection with the trypanosome-bearing insects was as  yet unsuspected, and, to me, its symptoms were absolutely unknown.    \"No, I have not,\" I replied. \"The disease is nothing more than a name to  me. But why do you ask? Has Mr. Graves been abroad?\"    \"Yes. He has been travelling for the last three or four years, and I  know that he spent some time recently in West Africa, where this disease  occurs. In fact, it was from him that I first heard about it.\"    This was a new fact. It shook my confidence in my diagnosis very  considerably, and inclined me to reconsider my suspicions. If Mr. Weiss  was lying to me, he now had me at a decided disadvantage.    \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"Is it possible that this can be sleeping  sickness?\"    \"I should not like to say that it is impossible,\" I replied. \"The  disease is practically unknown to me. I have never practised out of  England and have had no occasion to study it. Until I have looked the  subject up, I should not be in a position to give an opinion. Of course,  if I could see Mr. Graves in one of what we may call his 'lucid  intervals' I should be able to form a better idea. Do you think that  could be managed?\"    \"It might. I see the importance of it and will certainly do my best; but  he is a difficult man; a very difficult man. I sincerely hope it is not  sleeping sickness.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because--as I understood from him--that disease is invariably fatal,  sooner or later. There seem to be no cure. Do you think you will be able  to decide when you see him again?\"    \"I hope so,\" I replied. \"I shall look up the authorities and see exactly  what the symptoms are--that is, so far as they are known; but my  impression is that there is very little information available.\"    \"And in the meantime?\"    \"We will give him some medicine and attend to his general condition, and  you had better let me see him again as soon as possible.\" I was about to  say that the effect of the medicine itself might throw some light on the  patient's condition, but, as I proposed to treat him for morphine  poisoning, I thought it wiser to keep this item of information to  myself. Accordingly, I confined myself to a few general directions as to  the care of the patient, to which Mr. Weiss listened attentively. \"And,\"  I concluded, \"we must not lose sight of the opium question. You had  better search the room carefully and keep a close watch on the patient,  especially during his intervals of wakefulness.\"    \"Very well, doctor,\" Mr. Weiss replied, \"I will do all that you tell me  and I will send for you again as soon as possible, if you do not object  to poor Graves's ridiculous conditions. And now, if you will allow me to  pay your fee, I will go and order the carriage while you are writing the  prescription.\"    \"There is no need for a prescription,\" I said. \"I will make up some  medicine and give it to the coachman.\"    Mr. Weiss seemed inclined to demur to this arrangement, but I had my own  reasons for insisting on it. Modern prescriptions are not difficult to  read, and I did not wish Mr. Weiss to know what treatment the patient  was having.    As soon as I was left alone, I returned to the bedside and once more  looked down at the impassive figure. And as I looked, my suspicions  revived. It was very like morphine poisoning; and, if it was morphine,  it was no common, medicinal dose that had been given. I opened my bag  and took out my hypodermic case from which I extracted a little tube of  atropine tabloids. Shaking out into my hand a couple of the tiny discs,  I drew down the patient's under-lip and slipped the little tablets under  his tongue. Then I quickly replaced the tube and dropped the case into  my bag; and I had hardly done so when the door opened softly and the  housekeeper entered the room.    \"How do you find Mr. Graves?\" she asked in what I thought a very  unnecessarily low tone, considering the patient's lethargic state.    \"He seems to be very ill,\" I answered.    \"So!\" she rejoined, and added: \"I am sorry to hear that. We have been  anxious about him.\"    She seated herself on the chair by the bedside, and, shading the candle  from the patient's face--and her own, too--produced from a bag that hung  from her waist a half-finished stocking and began to knit silently and  with the skill characteristic of the German housewife. I looked at her  attentively (though she was so much in the shadow that I could see her  but indistinctly) and somehow her appearance prepossessed me as little  as did that of the other members of the household. Yet she was not an  ill-looking woman. She had an excellent figure, and the air of a person  of good social position; her features were good enough and her  colouring, although a little unusual, was not unpleasant. Like Mr.  Weiss, she had very fair hair, greased, parted in the middle and brushed  down as smoothly as the painted hair of a Dutch doll. She appeared to  have no eyebrows at all--owing, no doubt, to the light colour of the  hair--and the doll-like character was emphasized by her eyes, which were  either brown or dark grey, I could not see which. A further peculiarity  consisted in a \"habit spasm,\" such as one often sees in nervous  children; a periodical quick jerk of the head, as if a cap-string or  dangling lock were being shaken off the cheek. Her age I judged to be  about thirty-five.    The carriage, which one might have expected to be waiting, seemed to  take some time in getting ready. I sat, with growing impatience,  listening to the sick man's soft breathing and the click of the  housekeeper's knitting-needles. I wanted to get home, not only for my  own sake; the patient's condition made it highly desirable that the  remedies should be given as quickly as possible. But the minutes dragged  on, and I was on the point of expostulating when a bell rang on the  landing.    \"The carriage is ready,\" said Mrs. Schallibaum. \"Let me light you down  the stairs.\"    She rose, and, taking the candle, preceded me to the head of the stairs,  where she stood holding the light over the baluster-rail as I descended  and crossed the passage to the open side door. The carriage was drawn up  in the covered way as I could see by the faint glimmer of the distant  candle; which also enabled me dimly to discern the coachman standing  close by in the shadow. I looked round, rather expecting to see Mr.  Weiss, but, as he made no appearance, I entered the carriage. The door  was immediately banged to and locked, and I then heard the heavy bolts  of the gates withdrawn and the loud creaking of hinges. The carriage  moved out slowly and stopped; the gates slammed to behind me; I felt the  lurch as the coachman climbed to his seat and we started forward.    My reflections during the return journey were the reverse of agreeable.  I could not rid myself of the conviction that I was being involved in  some very suspicious proceedings. It was possible, of course, that this  feeling was due to the strange secrecy that surrounded my connection  with this case; that, had I made my visit under ordinary conditions, I  might have found in the patient's symptoms nothing to excite suspicion  or alarm. It might be so, but that consideration did not comfort me.    Then, my diagnosis might be wrong. It might be that this was, in  reality, a case of some brain affection accompanied by compression, such  as slow haemorrhage, abscess, tumour or simple congestion. These cases  were very difficult at times. But the appearances in this one did not  consistently agree with the symptoms accompanying any of these  conditions. As to sleeping sickness, it was, perhaps a more hopeful  suggestion, but I could not decide for or against it until I had more  knowledge; and against this view was the weighty fact that the symptoms  did exactly agree with the theory of morphine poisoning.    But even so, there was no conclusive evidence of any criminal act. The  patient might be a confirmed opium-eater, and the symptoms heightened by  deliberate deception. The cunning of these unfortunates is proverbial  and is only equalled by their secretiveness and mendacity. It would be  quite possible for this man to feign profound stupor so long as he was  watched, and then, when left alone for a few minutes, to nip out of bed  and help himself from some secret store of the drug. This would be quite  in character with his objection to seeing a doctor and his desire for  secrecy. But still, I did not believe it to be the true explanation. In  spite of all the various alternative possibilities, my suspicions came  back to Mr. Weiss and the strange, taciturn woman, and refused to budge.    For all the circumstances of the case were suspicious. The elaborate"]]]
