[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#3)"],[1,", a branch of which spread to within a few feet of the  sill.  Upon this branch now they both discovered the subject of their  recent conversation, a tall, well-built boy, balancing with ease upon  the bending limb and uttering loud shouts of glee as he noted the  terrified expressions upon the faces of his audience.    The mother and tutor both rushed toward the window but before they had  crossed half the room the boy had leaped nimbly to the sill and entered  the apartment with them.    \"'The wild man from Borneo has just come to town,'\" he sang, dancing a  species of war dance about his terrified mother and scandalized tutor,  and ending up by throwing his arms about the former's neck and kissing  her upon either cheek.    \"Oh, Mother,\" he cried, \"there's a wonderful, educated ape being shown  at one of the music halls.  Willie Grimsby saw it last night.  He says  it can do everything but talk.  It rides a bicycle, eats with knife and  fork, counts up to ten, and ever so many other wonderful things, and  can I go and see it too?  Oh, please, Mother--please let me.\"    Patting the boy's cheek affectionately, the mother shook her head  negatively.  \"No, Jack,\" she said; \"you know I do not approve of such  exhibitions.\"    \"I don't see why not, Mother,\" replied the boy.  \"All the other fellows  go and they go to the Zoo, too, and you'll never let me do even that.  Anybody'd think I was a girl--or a mollycoddle.  Oh, Father,\" he  exclaimed, as the door opened to admit a tall gray-eyed man.  \"Oh,  Father, can't I go?\"    \"Go where, my son?\" asked the newcomer.    \"He wants to go to a music hall to see a trained ape,\" said the mother,  looking warningly at her husband.    \"Who, Ajax?\" questioned the man.    The boy nodded.    \"Well, I don't know that I blame you, my son,\" said the father, \"I  wouldn't mind seeing him myself.  They say he is very wonderful, and  that for an anthropoid he is unusually large.  Let's all go, Jane--what  do you say?\"  And he turned toward his wife, but that lady only shook  her head in a most positive manner, and turning to Mr. Moore asked him  if it was not time that he and Jack were in the study for the morning  recitations.  When the two had left she turned toward her husband.    \"John,\" she said, \"something must be done to discourage Jack's tendency  toward anything that may excite the cravings for the savage life which  I fear he has inherited from you.  You know from your own experience  how strong is the call of the wild at times.  You know that often it  has necessitated a stern struggle on your part to resist the almost  insane desire which occasionally overwhelms you to plunge once again  into the jungle life that claimed you for so many years, and at the  same time you know, better than any other, how frightful a fate it  would be for Jack, were the trail to the savage jungle made either  alluring or easy to him.\"    \"I doubt if there is any danger of his inheriting a taste for jungle  life from me,\" replied the man, \"for I cannot conceive that such a  thing may be transmitted from father to son.  And sometimes, Jane, I  think that in your solicitude for his future you go a bit too far in  your restrictive measures.  His love for animals--his desire, for  example, to see this trained ape--is only natural in a healthy, normal  boy of his age.  Just because he wants to see Ajax is no indication  that he would wish to marry an ape, and even should he, far be it from  you Jane to have the right to cry 'shame!'\" and John Clayton, Lord  Greystoke, put an arm about his wife, laughing good-naturedly down into  her upturned face before he bent his head and kissed her.  Then, more  seriously, he continued:  \"You have never told Jack anything concerning  my early life, nor have you permitted me to, and in this I think that  you have made a mistake.  Had I been able to tell him of the  experiences of Tarzan of the Apes I could doubtless have taken much of  the glamour and romance from jungle life that naturally surrounds it in  the minds of those who have had no experience of it.  He might then  have profited by my experience, but now, should the jungle lust ever  claim him, he will have nothing to guide him but his own impulses, and  I know how powerful these may be in the wrong direction at times.\"    But Lady Greystoke only shook her head as she had a hundred other times  when the subject had claimed her attention in the past.    \"No, John,\" she insisted, \"I shall never give my consent to the  implanting in Jack's mind of any suggestion of the savage life which we  both wish to preserve him from.\"    It was evening before the subject was again referred to and then it was  raised by Jack himself.  He had been sitting, curled in a large chair,  reading, when he suddenly looked up and addressed his father.    \"Why,\" he asked, coming directly to the point, \"can't I go and see  Ajax?\"    \"Your mother does not approve,\" replied his father.    \"Do you?\"    \"That is not the question,\" evaded Lord Greystoke.  \"It is enough that  your mother objects.\"    \"I am going to see him,\" announced the boy, after a few moments of  thoughtful silence.  \"I am not different from Willie Grimsby, or any  other of the fellows who have been to see him.  It did not harm them  and it will not harm me.  I could go without telling you; but I would  not do that.  So I tell you now, beforehand, that I am going to see  Ajax.\"    There was nothing disrespectful or defiant in the boy's tone or manner.  His was merely a dispassionate statement of facts.  His father could  scarce repress either a smile or a show of the admiration he felt for  the manly course his son had pursued.    \"I admire your candor, Jack,\" he said.  \"Permit me to be candid, as  well.  If you go to see Ajax without permission, I shall punish you.  I  have never inflicted corporal punishment upon you, but I warn you that  should you disobey your mother's wishes in this instance, I shall.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the boy; and then:  \"I shall tell you, sir, when I  have been to see Ajax.\"    Mr. Moore's room was next to that of his youthful charge, and it was  the tutor's custom to have a look into the boy's each evening as the  former was about to retire.  This evening he was particularly careful  not to neglect his duty, for he had just come from a conference with  the boy's father and mother in which it had been impressed upon him  that he must exercise the greatest care to prevent Jack visiting the  music hall where Ajax was being shown.  So, when he opened the boy's  door at about half after nine, he was greatly excited, though not  entirely surprised to find the future Lord Greystoke fully dressed for  the street and about to crawl from his open bed room window.    Mr. Moore made a rapid spring across the apartment; but the waste of  energy was unnecessary, for when the boy heard him within the chamber  and realized that he had been discovered he turned back as though to  relinquish his planned adventure.    \"Where were you going?\" panted the excited Mr. Moore.    \"I am going to see Ajax,\" replied the boy, quietly.    \"I am astonished,\" cried Mr. Moore; but a moment later he was  infinitely more astonished, for the boy, approaching close to him,  suddenly seized him about the waist, lifted him from his feet and threw  him face downward upon the bed, shoving his face deep into a soft  pillow.    \"Be quiet,\" admonished the victor, \"or I'll choke you.\"    Mr. Moore struggled; but his efforts were in vain.  Whatever else  Tarzan of the Apes may or may not have handed down to his son he had at  least bequeathed him almost as marvelous a physique as he himself had  possessed at the same age.  The tutor was as putty in the boy's hands.  Kneeling upon him, Jack tore strips from a sheet and bound the man's  hands behind his back. Then he rolled him over and stuffed a gag of the  same material between his teeth, securing it with a strip wound about  the back of his victim's head.  All the while he talked in a low,  conversational tone.    \"I am Waja, chief of the Waji,\" he explained, \"and you are Mohammed  Dubn, the Arab sheik, who would murder my people and steal my ivory,\"  and he dexterously trussed Mr. Moore's hobbled ankles up behind to meet  his hobbled wrists.  \"Ah--ha!  Villain!  I have you in me power at  last.  I go; but I shall return!\"  And the son of Tarzan skipped across  the room, slipped through the open window, and slid to liberty by way  of the down spout from an eaves trough.    Mr. Moore wriggled and struggled about the bed.  He was sure that he  should suffocate unless aid came quickly.  In his frenzy of terror he  managed to roll off the bed.  The pain and shock of the fall jolted him  back to something like sane consideration of his plight.  Where before  he had been unable to think intelligently because of the hysterical  fear that had claimed him he now lay quietly searching for some means  of escape from his dilemma.  It finally occurred to him that the room  in which Lord and Lady Greystoke had been sitting when he left them was  directly beneath that in which he lay upon the floor.  He knew that  some time had elapsed since he had come up stairs and that they might  be gone by this time, for it seemed to him that he had struggled about  the bed, in his efforts to free himself, for an eternity.  But the best  that he could do was to attempt to attract attention from below, and  so, after many failures, he managed to work himself into a position in  which he could tap the toe of his boot against the floor.  This he  proceeded to do at short intervals, until, after what seemed a very  long time, he was rewarded by hearing footsteps ascending the stairs,  and presently a knock upon the door.  Mr. Moore tapped vigorously with  his toe--he could not reply in any other way.  The knock was repeated  after a moment's silence.  Again Mr. Moore tapped.  Would they never  open the door!  Laboriously he rolled in the direction of succor.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#3)"],[1," two steps backward the while, that none  might take him at a vantage.    \"By the black rood of Waltham!\" he roared, \"if any knave among you lays  a finger-end upon the edge of my gown, I will crush his skull like a  filbert!\" With his thick knotted arms, his thundering voice, and his  bristle of red hair, there was something so repellent in the man that  the three brothers flew back at the very glare of him; and the two rows  of white monks strained away from him like poplars in a tempest. The  Abbot only sprang forward with shining eyes; but the chancellor and the  master hung upon either arm and wrested him back out of danger's way.    \"He is possessed of a devil!\" they shouted. \"Run, brother Ambrose,  brother Joachim! Call Hugh of the Mill, and Woodman Wat, and Raoul with  his arbalest and bolts. Tell them that we are in fear of our lives! Run,  run! for the love of the Virgin!\"    But the novice was a strategist as well as a man of action. Springing  forward, he hurled his unwieldy weapon at brother Ambrose, and, as desk  and monk clattered on to the floor together, he sprang through the open  door and down the winding stair. Sleepy old brother Athanasius, at  the porter's cell, had a fleeting vision of twinkling feet and flying  skirts; but before he had time to rub his eyes the recreant had passed  the lodge, and was speeding as fast as his sandals could patter along  the Lyndhurst Road.        CHAPTER II. HOW ALLEYNE EDRICSON CAME OUT INTO THE WORLD.      Never had the peaceful atmosphere of the old Cistercian house been so  rudely ruffled. Never had there been insurrection so sudden, so short,  and so successful. Yet the Abbot Berghersh was a man of too firm a grain  to allow one bold outbreak to imperil the settled order of his great  household. In a few hot and bitter words, he compared their false  brother's exit to the expulsion of our first parents from the garden,  and more than hinted that unless a reformation occurred some others of  the community might find themselves in the same evil and perilous case.  Having thus pointed the moral and reduced his flock to a fitting state  of docility, he dismissed them once more to their labors and withdrew  himself to his own private chamber, there to seek spiritual aid in the  discharge of the duties of his high office.    The Abbot was still on his knees, when a gentle tapping at the door of  his cell broke in upon his orisons.    Rising in no very good humor at the interruption, he gave the word to  enter; but his look of impatience softened down into a pleasant and  paternal smile as his eyes fell upon his visitor.    He was a thin-faced, yellow-haired youth, rather above the middle size,  comely and well shapen, with straight, lithe figure and eager, boyish  features. His clear, pensive gray eyes, and quick, delicate expression,  spoke of a nature which had unfolded far from the boisterous joys and  sorrows of the world. Yet there was a set of the mouth and a prominence  of the chin which relieved him of any trace of effeminacy. Impulsive  he might be, enthusiastic, sensitive, with something sympathetic and  adaptive in his disposition; but an observer of nature's tokens would  have confidently pledged himself that there was native firmness and  strength underlying his gentle, monk-bred ways.    The youth was not clad in monastic garb, but in lay attire, though his  jerkin, cloak and hose were all of a sombre hue, as befitted one who  dwelt in sacred precincts. A broad leather strap hanging from his  shoulder supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to  carry. In one hand he grasped a thick staff pointed and shod with metal,  while in the other he held his coif or bonnet, which bore in its front a  broad pewter medal stamped with the image of Our Lady of Rocamadour.    \"Art ready, then, fair son?\" said the Abbot. \"This is indeed a day of  comings and of goings. It is strange that in one twelve hours the Abbey  should have cast off its foulest weed and should now lose what we are  fain to look upon as our choicest blossom.\"    \"You speak too kindly, father,\" the youth answered. \"If I had my will I  should never go forth, but should end my days here in Beaulieu. It hath  been my home as far back as my mind can carry me, and it is a sore thing  for me to have to leave it.\"    \"Life brings many a cross,\" said the Abbot gently. \"Who is without them?  Your going forth is a grief to us as well as to yourself. But there  is no help. I had given my foreword and sacred promise to your father,  Edric the Franklin, that at the age of twenty you should be sent out  into the world to see for yourself how you liked the savor of it. Seat  thee upon the settle, Alleyne, for you may need rest ere long.\"    The youth sat down as directed, but reluctantly and with diffidence.  The Abbot stood by the narrow window, and his long black shadow fell  slantwise across the rush-strewn floor.    \"Twenty years ago,\" he said, \"your father, the Franklin of Minstead,  died, leaving to the Abbey three hides of rich land in the hundred of  Malwood, and leaving to us also his infant son on condition that we  should rear him until he came to man's estate. This he did partly  because your mother was dead, and partly because your elder brother,  now Socman of Minstead, had already given sign of that fierce and rude  nature which would make him no fit companion for you. It was his desire  and request, however, that you should not remain in the cloisters, but  should at a ripe age return into the world.\"    \"But, father,\" interrupted the young man, \"it is surely true that I am  already advanced several degrees in clerkship?\"    \"Yes, fair son, but not so far as to bar you from the garb you now wear  or the life which you must now lead. You have been porter?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Exorcist?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Reader?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Acolyte?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"But have sworn no vow of constancy or chastity?\"    \"No, father.\"    \"Then you are free to follow a worldly life. But let me hear, ere you  start, what gifts you take away with you from Beaulieu? Some I already  know. There is the playing of the citole and the rebeck. Our choir will  be dumb without you. You carve too?\"    The youth's pale face flushed with the pride of the skilled workman.  \"Yes, holy father,\" he answered. \"Thanks to good brother Bartholomew, I  carve in wood and in ivory, and can do something also in silver and  in bronze. From brother Francis I have learned to paint on vellum, on  glass, and on metal, with a knowledge of those pigments and essences  which can preserve the color against damp or a biting air. Brother  Luke hath given me some skill in damask work, and in the enamelling of  shrines, tabernacles, diptychs and triptychs. For the rest, I know a  little of the making of covers, the cutting of precious stones, and the  fashioning of instruments.\"    \"A goodly list, truly,\" cried the superior with a smile. \"What clerk of  Cambrig or of Oxenford could say as much? But of thy reading--hast not  so much to show there, I fear?\"    \"No, father, it hath been slight enough. Yet, thanks to our good  chancellor, I am not wholly unlettered. I have read Ockham, Bradwardine,  and other of the schoolmen, together with the learned Duns Scotus and  the book of the holy Aquinas.\"    \"But of the things of this world, what have you gathered from your  reading? From this high window you may catch a glimpse over the wooden  point and the smoke of Bucklershard of the mouth of the Exe, and the  shining sea. Now, I pray you, Alleyne, if a man were to take a ship and  spread sail across yonder waters, where might he hope to arrive?\"    The youth pondered, and drew a plan amongst the rushes with the point  of his staff. \"Holy father,\" said he, \"he would come upon those parts  of France which are held by the King's Majesty. But if he trended to the  south he might reach Spain and the Barbary States. To his north would be  Flanders and the country of the Eastlanders and of the Muscovites.\"    \"True. And how if, after reaching the King's possessions, he still  journeyed on to the eastward?\"    \"He would then come upon that part of France which is still in dispute,  and he might hope to reach the famous city of Avignon, where dwells our  blessed father, the prop of Christendom.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Then he would pass through the land of the Almains and the great Roman  Empire, and so to the country of the Huns and of the Lithuanian pagans,  beyond which lies the great city of Constantine and the kingdom of the  unclean followers of Mahmoud.\"    \"And beyond that, fair son?\"    \"Beyond that is Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and the great river which  hath its source in the Garden of Eden.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Nay, good father, I cannot tell. Methinks the end of the world is not  far from there.\"    \"Then we can still find something to teach thee, Alleyne,\" said the  Abbot complaisantly. \"Know that many strange nations lie betwixt there  and the end of the world. There is the country of the Amazons, and the  country of the dwarfs, and the country of the fair but evil women who  slay with beholding, like the basilisk. Beyond that again is the kingdom  of Prester John and of the great Cham. These things I know for very  sooth, for I had them from that pious Christian and valiant knight, Sir  John de Mandeville, who stopped twice at Beaulieu on his way to and from  Southampton, and discoursed to us concerning what he had seen from the  reader's desk in the refectory, until there was many a good brother who  got neither bit nor sup, so stricken were they by his strange tales.\"    \"I would fain know, father,\" asked the young man, \"what there may be at  the end of the world?\"    \"There are some things,\" replied the Abbot gravely, \"into which it was  never intended that we should inquire. But you have a long road before  you. Whither will you first turn?\"    \"To my brother's at Minstead. If he be indeed an ungodly"]]]
