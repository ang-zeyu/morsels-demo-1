CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM    For about two quarts and a half of cream use a pint and a half of milk,  a quart of thin cream, two cupfuls of sugar, two ounces of Walter Baker  & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, two eggs, and two heaping  tablespoonfuls of flour.    Put the milk on to boil in a double-boiler. Put the flour and one cupful  of the sugar in a bowl; add the eggs, and beat the mixture until light.  Stir this into the boiling milk, and cook for twenty minutes, stirring  often.    Scrape the chocolate, and put it in a small saucepan. Add four  tablespoonfuls of sugar (which should be taken from the second cupful)  and two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth  and glossy. Add this to the cooking mixture.    When the preparation has cooked for twenty minutes, take it from the  fire and add the remainder of the sugar and the cream, which should be  gradually beaten into the hot mixture. Set away to cool, and when cold,  freeze.      CHOCOLATE CREAM PIES    Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and a cupful and a quarter of  powdered sugar. Add two well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of wine,  half a cupful of milk, and a cupful and a half of sifted flour, with  which has been mixed a teaspoonful and a half of baking powder. Bake  this in four well-buttered, deep, tin plates for about fifteen minutes  in a moderate oven.    Put half a pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Beat  together the yolks of two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar,  and a level tablespoonful of flour. Stir this mixture into the boiling  milk, beating well. Add one-sixth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for  fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cooked, flavor with half a  teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Put two of the cakes on two large  plates, spread the cream over them, and lay the other two cakes on top.  Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into  them one cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Shave  one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in  a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful of  boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Now add  three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and stir into the beaten egg and  sugar. Spread on the pies and set away for a few hours.      CHOCOLATE MOUSSE    Put a three-quart mould in a wooden pail, first lining the bottom with  fine ice and a thin layer of coarse salt. Pack the space between the  mould and the pail solidly with fine ice and coarse salt, using two  quarts of salt and ice enough to fill the space. Whip one quart of  cream, and drain it in a sieve. Whip again all the cream that drains  through. Put in a small pan one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium  No. 1 Chocolate, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water,  and stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add three  tablespoonfuls of cream. Sprinkle a cupful of powdered sugar over the  whipped cream. Pour the chocolate in a thin stream into the cream, and  stir gently until well mixed. Wipe out the chilled mould, and turn the  cream into it. Cover, and then place a little ice lightly on top. Wet a  piece of carpet in water, and cover the top of the pail. Set away for  three or four hours; then take the mould from the ice, dip it in cold  water, wipe, and then turn the mousse out on a flat dish.      CHOCOLATE CHARLOTTE    Soak a quarter of a package of gelatine in one-third of a cupful of cold  water for two hours. Whip one pint of cream to a froth, and put it in a  bowl, which should be placed in a pan of ice-water. Put half an ounce of  shaved chocolate in a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one  of boiling water, and stir over the hot fire until smooth and glossy.  Add to this a gill of hot milk and the soaked gelatine, and stir until  the gelatine is dissolved. Sprinkle a generous half cupful of powdered  sugar over the cream. Now add the chocolate and gelatine mixture, and  stir gently until it begins to thicken. Line a quart charlotte-mould  with lady fingers, and when the cream is so thick that it will just  pour, turn it gently into the mould. Place the charlotte in a cold  place for an hour or more, and, at serving time, turn out on a flat  dish.      CHOCOLATE BAVARIAN CREAM    For one large mould of cream, use half a package of gelatine, one gill  of milk, two quarts of whipped cream, one gill of sugar, and two and a  half ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate.    Soak the gelatine in cold water for two hours. Whip and drain the cream,  scrape the chocolate, and put the milk on to boil. Put the chocolate,  two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of hot water in a small saucepan,  and stir on a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this into the hot  milk. Now add the soaked gelatine and the remainder of the sugar. Strain  this mixture into a basin that will hold two quarts or more. Place the  basin in a pan of ice-water, and stir until cold, when it will begin to  thicken. Instantly begin to stir in the whipped cream, adding half the  amount at first. When all the cream has been added, dip the mould in  cold water and turn the cream into it. Place in the ice-chest for an  hour or more.    At serving-time dip the mould in tepid water. See that the cream will  come from the sides of the mould, and turn out on a flat dish. Serve  with whipped cream.      CHOCOLATE CREAM    Soak a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for two hours. Put  one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Shave two  ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in a  small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water.  Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir into the hot  milk. Beat the yolks of five eggs with half a cupful of sugar. Add to  the gelatine, and stir the mixture into the hot milk. Cook three minutes  longer, stirring all the while. On taking from the fire, add two  teaspoonfuls of vanilla and half a saltspoonful of salt. Strain, and  pour into moulds that have been rinsed in cold water. Set away to  harden, and serve with sugar and cream.      CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE    Put one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire.  Sprinkle into it one level tablespoonful of sea-moss farina. Cover, and  cook until the mixture looks white, stirring frequently. It will take  about twenty minutes. While the milk and farina are cooking, shave two  ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into  a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water.  Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, then stir into the cooked  mixture. Add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla.  Strain, and turn into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water. Set  the mould in a cold place, and do not disturb it until the blanc-mange  is cold and firm. Serve with sugar and cream.      CHOCOLATE CREAM RENVERSEE    Use one quart of milk, seven eggs, half a pint of sugar, one ounce of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, half a teaspoonful of  salt. Put the milk on the fire in the double-boiler. Shave the  chocolate, and put it in a small pan with three tablespoonfuls of the  sugar and one of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and  glossy; then stir into the hot milk, and take the milk from the fire to  cool.    Put three tablespoonfuls of sugar into a charlotte-mould that will hold  a little more than a quart, and place on the stove. When the sugar melts  and begins to smoke, move the mould round and round, to coat it with the  burnt sugar, then place on the table. Beat together the remainder of the  sugar, the eggs, and the salt. Add the cold milk and chocolate to the  mixture, and after straining into the charlotte-mould, place in a deep  pan, with enough tepid water to come nearly to the top of the mould.  Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the center. Test the cream by  running a knife through the center. If firm and smooth, it is done. It  will take forty or forty-five minutes to cook. When icy-cold, turn on a  flat dish. Serve with whipped cream that has been flavored with sugar  and vanilla.      BAKED CHOCOLATE CUSTARD    For five small custards use one pint of milk, two eggs, one ounce of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, one-fourth of a  teaspoonful of salt, and a piece of stick cinnamon about an inch long.    Put the cinnamon and milk in the double-boiler, place on the fire and  cook for ten minutes. Shave the chocolate, and put it in a small pan  with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water. Stir this  over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir it into the hot  milk, after which take the liquid mixture from the fire and cool.    Beat together with a spoon the eggs, salt and two tablespoonfuls of the  sugar. Add the cooled milk and strain. Pour the mixture into the cups,  which place in a deep pan. Pour into the pan enough tepid water to come  nearly to the top of the cups. Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the  center. It will take about half an hour. Test by running a knife through  the center. If the custard is milky, it is not done. Serve very cold.      CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE    Half a pint of milk, two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, three  tablespoonfuls of sugar, one rounding tablespoonful of butter, two  tablespoonfuls of flour, four eggs.    Put the milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Beat the  butter to a soft cream, and beat the flour into it. Gradually pour the  hot milk on this, stirring all the time. Return to the fire and cook for  six minutes. Put the shaved chocolate, sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of  water in a small pan over a hot fire, and stir until smooth and glossy.  Stir this into the mixture in the double-boiler.

No man was made to live alone. For an  individual, existence entirely independent of  <p 29>  other members of the race is the conception  of a dreamer; apart from others one would  fail to become _*human_. Modern psychology  has abandoned the individualistic and adopted  the social point of view. We no longer think  of _*imitation_ as a characteristic only of animals,  children, and weak-minded folk.    _We have come to see that imitation is the  greatest factor in the education of the young and  a continuous process with all of us. The part  of wisdom, then, is to utilize this power from  which we cannot escape, by setting up a perfect  copy for imitation_.    The child brought up by a Chinaman  imitates the sounds he hears, hence speaks  Chinese; brought up in an American home,  English is his speech--ungrammatical or  correct according to the usage of his companions.  If one boy in a group walks on  stilts or plays marbles, the others follow his  example. If a social leader rides in an automobile,  wears a Panama hat, or plays golf,  all the members of this circle are restless till  they have the same experience. The same  <p 30>  phenomenon is seen in the professions and in  business. If one bank decides to erect a  building for its own use, other banks in the  city begin to consult architects. If one manufacturer  or distributor in a given field adopts  a new policy in manufacturing or in extending  his trade zone, his rivals immediately consider  plans of a similar sort. Partly, of course,  this act is defensive. In the main, however,  imitation and emulation are at the bottom  of the move.    For the sake of clearness, in studying acts  of imitation we separate them into two  classes--_*voluntary_ imitation (also called conscious  imitation) and _*instinctive_ imitation (also  known as _*suggestive_ imitation).    A peculiar signature may strike my fancy  so that consciously and deliberately I may  try to imitate it. This is a clear case of  voluntary imitation. Threading crowded city  streets, I see a man crossing at a particular  point and voluntarily follow in his path. In  learning a new skating figure I watch an expert  attentively and try to repeat his perform-  <p 31>  ance. In writing letters or advertisements  or magazine articles, I analyze the work  of other men and consciously imitate what  seems best. Or I observe a fellow-laborer  working faster than I, and forthwith try to  catch and hold his pace.    The contagion of yawning, on the other  hand, is instinctive imitation. Also when in  a crowd during the homeward evening rush,  we instinctively quicken our pace though there  may be no reason for hurry.    For precisely similar reasons, a ``loafer''  or a careless or inefficient workman will lower  the efficiency or slow up the production of  the men about him, no matter how earnest  or industrious their natural habits. Night  work by clerks, also, is taken by some office  managers to indicate a slump in industry during  the day. To correct this the individuals  who are drags on the organization are discovered,  and either are revitalized or discharged.    _I have seen more than one machine shop where  production could have been materially raised_  <p 32>  _by the simple expedient of weeding out the workmen  who were satisfied with a mere living wage  earned by piecework, thereby setting a dilatory  example to the rest; and replacing them with  fresh men ambitious to earn all they could, who  would have been imitated by the others_.    In these instances it is assumed that the  imitation is not voluntary, but that we  unconsciously imitate whatever actions happen  to catch our attention. For the negative  action, the ``slowing down'' process, we have  the greater affinity simply because labor or  exertion is naturally distasteful. One such  influence or example, therefore, may sway us  more than a dozen positive impulses towards  industry.    Imitation thus broadly considered is seen  to be of the utmost importance in every walk  of life. The greatest and most original genius  is in the main a creature of imitation. By  imitation he reaches the level of knowledge  and skill attained by others; and upon this  foundation builds his structure of original and  creative thought, experiment, and achieve-  <p 33>  ment. Furthermore he does not imitate at  random; but concentrates his activity on  those things and persons in the line of his pursuits.    Among my associates are both industrious  and shiftless individuals. I instinctively imitate  the actions of all those with whom I come  in contact; but if I am sufficiently ambitious,  I will consciously imitate the acts of the industrious.  This patterning after energetic models  will render me more active and efficient than  would have been possible for me without such  examples.    _Imitation, accordingly, is an imperative factor  both in self-development and in the control of  groups of individuals. Knowing that I instinctively  imitate all sorts of acts, I must take  care that only the right sort shall catch my attention_.    And since imitation is a most effective aid  in development, I must provide myself with  the best models. To reduce my tendency to  idleness or procrastination I must avoid the  companionship of the shiftless. To acquire  <p 34>  ease and accuracy in the use of French, I must  consort with masters of that tongue.    In handling others, the same rule holds.    _To profit from the instinctive imitation of  my men, I must control their environment in  shop or office and make sure that examples of  energy and efficiency are numerous enough  to catch their attention and establish, as it were,  an atmosphere of industry in the place_.    There are instances in which it would be  to the mutual interest of employer and employee  to increase the speed of work, but conditions  may limit or forbid the use of pacemakers.  In construction work and in some  of the industries where there are minute subdivision  of operations and continuity of processes  this method of increasing efficiency is  very commonly applied. In many factories,  however, such an effort to ``speed up'' production  might stir resentment, even among the  pieceworkers, and have an effect exactly opposite  to that desired. The alternative, of  course, is for the employer to secure unconscious  pacemakers by providing incentives  <p 35>  for the naturally ambitious men in the way of  a premium or bonus system or other reward  for unusual efficiency.    To take advantage of their conscious or  voluntary imitation, workpeople must be  provided with examples which appeal to them  as admirable and inspire the wish to emulate  them. A common application of this principle  is seen in the choice of department heads,  foremen, and other bosses. Invariably these  win promotion by industry, skill, and efficiency  greater than that displayed by their fellows,  or by all-round mastery of their trades which  enable them to show their less efficient mates  how any and all operations should be conducted.    This focusing of attention upon individuals  worthy of imitation has been carried much  farther by various companies. Through their  ``house organs''--weekly or monthly papers  published primarily for circulation within the  organization--they make record of every  incident reflecting unusual skill, initiative, or  personal power in an individual member of  the organization.  <p 36>    A big order closed, a difficult contract  secured, a complex or delicate operation performed  in less than the usual time, a new personal  record in production, the invention of  an unproved method or machine--whatever  the achievement, it is described and glorified,  its author praised and held up for emulation.  This, indeed, is one of the methods by which  the larger sales organizations have obtained  remarkable results.    _Graphically told, the story of an important  sale with the salesman's picture alongside makes  double use of the instinct of imitation. It  suggests forcibly that every man in the field can  duplicate the achievement and tells how he can  do it_.    Frequently, examples of initiative and efficiency  are borrowed from outside organizations.  ``Carrying a message to Garcia'' has  long been a business synonym for immediate  and effective execution of orders. One big  company, employing thousands of mechanics  and developing all its executives and skilled  experts from boys and men within the or-  <p 37>  ganization, has printed in its house organ  studies of all the great American and English  inventors from Stephenson and Fulton to  Edison and Westinghouse. These histories  emphasize the facts that these men were self-  taught and bench-trained, and that their  achievements can be imitated by every intelligent  mechanic in the organization.    _In teaching and learning by imitation certain  modifying facts are to be kept constantly in mind.  We tend to imitate everything which catches our  attention, but certain things appeal more powerfully  than others_.    The acts of those whom I admire are particularly  contagious, but I remain indifferent  to the acts of those who are uninteresting.  Acts showing a skill to which I aspire are  immediately imitated, while acts representing  stages of development from which I have escaped  are less likely to be imitated. We imitate  the acts of hearty, jovial individuals more  than the acts of others. This point cannot  be pressed too far since a surly and selfish  individual often seems to corrupt a whole  <p 38>  group. Also it is not always the acts which  I admire that are imitated. If I am frequently  with a lame person, I am in danger  of acquiring a limp; one who stutters is  clearly injurious to my freedom"]]]
