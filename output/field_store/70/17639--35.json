With all his faults (if they be such, which I do not admit),  the present Master of the Rolls is a good judge, and an able man;--\"un  peu vif, peut-etre,\" as Fanchette might say; and it is more agreeable  than otherwise, to see one who has devoted his life to the study of the  law, enjoying himself in lighter pursuits, after having attained rank  and dignity in the profession; and after having punctually and  satisfactorily executed the important duties of the day, seeking at its  close, and participating in the gaiety which society offers. It speaks a  good heart and cheerful temper; whereas, when we hear a distaste  declared for music, and that of the highest character, we cannot but  call to mind \"He who has not the concord of sweet sounds\" within  himself;--but I will not pursue the quotation. Besides, were there  persons fools enough to blame Sir John for his social propensities, he  might answer them as the Parisian coachman did.--\"What was that?\"--\"Why,  a French Jehu was tried in 1818, for some accident caused by his  cabriolet, before the Criminal Court of Paris; when, having heard the  evidence, the President of the Tribunal declared that he stood  acquitted, but that the court felt it its duty to blame him, and that he  was blamed accordingly.\" \"Blamed!\" exclaimed Jehu; \"Blamed!--I don't  quite understand your Honor;--but--but--will it prevent my handling the  ribands, and driving the _wehicle_?\"--\"No!\" said the judge. \"Then, with  all respect for your Honor, I just laugh at it,\" said coachee, bowing.  \"And so do I,\" said the president also, in rising to leave the  court.--_New Monthly Magazine_.

These _Cartoons_ were executed by the famous Raphael, while engaged in  the chambers of the Vatican, under the auspices of Pope Julius II. and  Leo X. As soon as they were finished, they were sent to Flanders to be  copied in tapestry, for adorning the pontifical apartments; but the  tapestries were not conveyed to Rome till after the decease of Raphael,  and probably not before the dreadful sack of that city in 1527, under  the pontificate of Clement VII; when Raphael's scholars having fled from  thence, none were left to inquire after the original Cartoons, which lay  neglected in the storerooms of the manufactory, the money for the  tapestry having never been paid. The revolution that happened soon after  in the low countries prevented their being noticed during a period in  which works of art were wholly neglected. They were purchased by king  Charles I. at the recommendation of Rubens, but had been much injured by  the weavers. At the sale of the royal pictures in 1653, these Cartoons  were purchased for 300_l_. by Oliver Cromwell, against whom no one would  presume to bid. The protector pawned them to the Dutch court for upwards  of 50,000_l._, and, after the revolution, King William brought them over  again to England, and built a gallery for their reception in Hampton  Court. Originally there were twelve of these Cartoons, but four of them  have been destroyed by damps and neglect. The subjects were the  adoration of the Magi, the conversion of St. Paul, the martyrdom of St.  Stephen and St. Paul before Felix and Agrippa. Two of these were in the  possession of the King of Sardinia, and two of Louis XIV. of France, who  is said to have offered 100,000 louis d'ors for the seven, which are  justly represented as \"the glory of England, and the envy of all other  polite nations.\" The twelfth, the subject of which was the murder of the  innocents, belonged to a private gentleman in England, who pledged it  for a sum of money; but when the person who had taken this valuable  deposit found it was to be redeemed, he greatly damaged the drawing; for  which the gentleman brought an action against him. A third part of it is  still remaining in the possession of William Hoare, R.A., at Bath.    _Cartoon_ is derived from the Italian _cartone_, a painting or drawing  upon large paper. Raphael died on the same day of the year on which he  was born, Good Friday, in 1520, at the age of thirty-seven, deeply  lamented by all who knew his value. His body lay for awhile in state in  one of the rooms wherein he had displayed the powers of his mind, and he  was honoured with a public funeral; his last produce, the  _transfiguration_, being carried before him in the procession. The  unrelenting hand of death (says his biographer) set a period to his  labours, and deprived the world of further benefit from his talents,  when he had only attained an age at which most other men are but  beginning to be useful. \"We see him in his cradle (said Fuseli); we hear  him stammer; but propriety rocked the cradle, and character formed his  lips.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      TO MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.

My murder'd queen, as on thine image once    The gaze alike of prince and peasant rested--    As if, unsated of thy thrilling glance,    They never until then of beauty tasted:    So I, by lonely contemplation led    To muse awhile amid the silent dead--    Turn me from all around I hear or see--    From all of Shakspeare and of great to thee:    And think on all thy wrongs--on all the shame    That dims for ever thine oppressor's name;    On all thy faults, nor few nor far between,    But then thou wert--a woman and a queen.    Proud titles, even in a barb'rous age,    To stem th' impetuous tide of party rage;    While as I gaze each well-known feature seems    To stir with life, and realise my dreams    That paint thee seated on the Scottish throne,    With all the blaze of beauty round thee thrown;    Then see thee passing from thy dungeon cell,    And hear thy parting sigh--thy last farewell.    _Stray Leaves._           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT GRECIAN SEPULCHRE      [Illustration]    A beautiful illustration of an ancient Grecian sepulchre or funeral  chamber, heads the second chapter of Mr. Britton's \"Union of  Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting,\" from which work we have copied  the annexed engraved view. The interior of the chamber exhibits a  skeleton and the urns containing the ashes of the dead. The combat leads  us to the conclusion, that the tomb contains the remains of a chief; for  it was the barbarous custom of the Greeks to sacrifice captives at the  tombs of their heroes.    Of the funeral rites and ceremonies of the Greeks and other nations, we  subjoin the following:--    The most simple and natural kind of funeral monuments, and therefore the  most ancient and universal, consist in a mound of earth, or a heap of  stones, raised over the ashes of the departed: of such monuments mention  is made in the Book of Joshua, and in Homer and Virgil. Many of them  still occur in various parts of this kingdom, especially in those  elevated and sequestered situations where they have neither been defaced  by agriculture nor inundation.    The ancients are said to have buried their dead in their own houses,  whence, according to some, the original of that species of idolatry  consisting in the worship of household gods.    The place of burial amongst the Jews was never particularly determined.  We find that they had burial-places upon the highways, in gardens, and  upon mountains. We read, that Abraham was buried with Sarah, his wife,  in the cave of Macphelah, in the field of Ephron, and Uzziah, King of  Judah, slept with his fathers in the field of the burial which pertained  to the kings.    The primitive Greeks were buried in places prepared for that purpose in  their own houses; but in after ages they adopted the judicious practice  of establishing the burial grounds in desert islands, and outside the  walls of towns, by that means securing them from profanation, and  themselves from the liability of catching infection from those who had  died of contagious disorders.    The Romans prohibited burning or burying in the city, both from a sacred  and civil consideration, that the priests might not be contaminated by  touching a dead body, and that houses might not be endangered by the  frequency of funeral fires.    The custom of burning the dead had its foundation laid deep in nature:  an anxious fondness to preserve the great and good, the dear friend and  the near relative, was the sole motive that prevailed in the institution  of this solemnity. \"That seems to me,\" says Cicero, \"to have been the  most ancient kind of burial, which, according to Xenophon, was used by  Cyrus. For the body is returned to the earth, and so placed as to be  covered with the veil of its mother.\" Pliny also agrees with Cicero upon  this point, and says the custom of burial preceded that of burning among  the Romans. According to Monfaucon, the custom of burning entirely  ceased at Rome about the time of Theodorius the younger. When cremation  ceased on the introduction of Christianity, the believing Romans,  together with the Romanized and converted Britons, would necessarily, as  it is observed by Mr. Grough, \"betake themselves to the use of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11389"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Now Fitzadree's good charger was all mettle,      And soon won to the middle of the stream--    But then the sky grew black as a tea kettle;      It rained, too, quite as fast as ever steam    Rose. But the thing which did at last unsettle      The balance of John's steed, was what you'll deem    A being that was nearly supernatural--    But here the waves John's clothes began to spatter all.      A form rose up from out the waves' abyss--      A monstrous little man with a black hide,    Scarce four feet high, yet he was not remiss,      But dash'd the waves about--and then he cried,    With a demoniac laugh, or rather hiss,      \"Die, mortal, die!\" and John sank down and died,    The which, when Jeannie saw, she only sigh'd,    \"I come, my John, I come, to be thy bride.\"      The figure was the Kelpie--that she knew,      And madly she rush'd on towards the shore;    The Kelpie roar'd, \"Come, mortal, come thou too.\"      Ere he'd done speaking, Jeannie was no more;    She'd dash'd into the waves, and left no clue,      More than a steamer leaves just left the Nore,    By which you might discover where she lay,    And drag her upwards to the realms of day.      But what befel the cause of all these woes?      That's what I never heard, so cannot tell;    But this I know, that this same Richard Groze      Return'd no more to bonnie Scotland. Well,    I only hope he may in bed repose,      And that he may at last escape from hell.    And this I know, that if you do not smother    This poem, when I choose I'll write another.

In one of the critiques on the last _Monthly Magazine_, some verses by  Mrs. Hemans are said to be \"elegant and lady-like.\"           *       *       *       *       *        THE SKETCH BOOK    A DAY AT ST. CLOUD.    _September_ 24, 1826.          I walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black coat, and      looking through the glass, saw all the world in yellow, blue,      and green, running at the ring of pleasure.--STERNE.    St. Cloud is the Richmond of France; or rather, it is to Paris what  Richmond, in the days of its regal splendour, was to London--the summer  palace of the court. In this comparison, allowance must be made for the  opposite building taste of each nation; especially as Richmond has an  appearance of substantial comfort in its massive brick mansions and  rusticated cottage groups. The French _Sheen_ is, on the contrary,  gayer; the exterior of the residences being whitened, or what is still  more artificial, coloured and decorated in tawdry French taste. Such, at  least, is the character of the _auberges_, or inns, and _restaurateurs_,  with which St. Cloud is even better supplied than our Richmond. In  situation, however, they strongly assimilate; the former being placed on  an acclivity overlooking the Seine, as the latter is on the banks of the  Thames.    St. Cloud, as I have already said, is the usual summer residence of the  French court; and with a royal liberality which might be less politic  elsewhere, the park is granted for three fairs--September 7, and the  three following Sundays, on the last of which I resolved to visit the  fete of St. Cloud. It was a glowing September day. The sun shone with  more than mellow warmth through the groves of the Tuilleries, and on the  little southern terrace, which was unusually crowded with groups of rosy  children, with here and there a valetudinarian, who seemed to have  emerged from his chamber to enjoy the parting glories of the season.  Crowds of elegantly-dressed company were promenading the mall, or  principal walk, and some few were not incuriously lingering about the  enclosed parterres of the garden, whose beauties would soon be  transported to a milder atmosphere. There was a general stir in the  neighbouring streets; it did not resemble the bustle of business, but  had more of the gaiety of a holiday scene. The _Pont Royal_ was thronged  with passengers, and just beneath it, were several hundreds, many of  whom were embarking in the steam-boat for St. Cloud. But the Seine is at  all times less inviting for such an excursion than our Thames; and in  the summer months many insulated spots may be seen in the centre of the  French river. At the next bridge (Louis XVI.) there was a general muster  of carriages, each adapted for six or eight passengers, and drawn by one  or two horses. Here was a loud clamour of \"St. Cloud\" and \"Versailles\"  among the drivers, some of whom were even more officious than the Jehus  of Greenwich, or the wights of Charing Cross or Piccadilly. I resisted  all their importunities, and passed on through the _Champs Elysees_, or  a dusty road through a grove, intersected with ill-formed paths, with a  few gaudy cafes bearing pompous inscriptions--for Voltaire has made the  French too fond of nomenclature to say with our Shakspeare, \"what's in a  name?\" The road presented a strange specimen of the insubordination of  French driving, notwithstanding police superintendants affected much  concern in the matter. Diligences, fiacres, and carriages resembling  large, covered cabriolets, might be seen loaded with gaily-dressed women  and children, with a due proportion of young Parisians, all just in the  hey-day of mirth, drawn by dust-provoking Flanders horses, their drivers  slashing almost indiscriminately, and, with their clamour and confusion,  far exceeding the Epsom road on a raceday.    At length, escaping from the dust and din of the French Elysium, I  halted to enjoy the distant view of the city of Paris, from the gate of  the barrier. It was indeed an interesting scene. Through the avenue,  whose area presented a living stream of traffic, might be seen the  terraces and groves of the Tuilleries, and the spacious and irregular  palace, with its cupola tops; the tarnished dome of the Invalides; the  cupola of St. Genevieve; the gray towers of Notre Dame; then the winding  Seine, with its bridges, quays, and terraces, flanked with the long line  of the Tuilleries, and the Luxembourg, and Louvre galleries, on the one  side; and on the other by the noble facade of the Chamber of Deputies;  the courtly mansions of St. Germain, and the blackened front and dome of  the Institute. What a multitude of associations flitted across the  memory, by a single glance at PARIS--the capital of that gay,  light-hearted, and mercurial people--the French nation--the focus of  European luxury, and the grand political arena of modern history, the  very calendar of whose events, within the last half century, will form  one of the most interesting episodes that ever glowed among the records  of human character. In the chain might be traced the vain-glory of  conquest linked with defeated ambition, and the sullied splendour of  royalty just breaking through the clouds of discontent, and slowly  dispelling the mists of disaffection and political prejudice. What an  unenviable contrast to the man who has \"no enemy but wind and rough  weather.\" The same objects that prompted these discordant reflections  gave rise to others of the most opposite character; and within the  walls, where treaties, abdications, and warrants, by turns, settled and  resettled, exiled and condemned--were the store-houses of art, with all  her proud and peaceful labours of sculpture, painting, and architecture,  through galleries and saloons, on whose contents the chisel and the  pencil had lingered many a life, and reduced the compass of its fond  designs to the cubits of a statue, the fame of a picture, or the glory  of a pillar or ceiling--such are the frail elements of human art.    The road now began to exhibit the usual appearance of an approach to a  country fete or fair. Scores of pedestrians, overcome with the heat and  dust of the day, might be seen at the little boxes or shops of the  _traiteurs_, or cooks, and at the houses of the _marchands de vin et de  la biacre_; these by their anticipated anxiety caused the line from  Paris to St. Cloud to resemble a road-side fair. Cheerfulness and  vivacity were upper-most in the passengers; and the elastic pace of  dozens of gaily-dressed _soubrettes_ not a little enhanced the interest  of the scene. Neither were these charms impaired by that species of  vulgarity which not unfrequently characterizes the road to our suburban  fairs; and, what is still more creditable to humanity, there was no  brutality towards jaded horses or hacks sinking beneath their loads.    Historians attach some antiquarian importance to the village of St.  Cloud, it being historically confounded with the earliest times of the  French monarchy; for, from the beginning of the first race, the kings of  France had a country-seat here.[5]        [5] For an engraving and account of the Palace of St. Cloud, see      MIRROR, vol. ii. page 225.    I now reached the bridge of St. Cloud, an elegant modern structure which  crosses the Seine, near the entrance to the village. Here the river  loses much of its importance; and in summer, the steam-boats are not  unfrequently delayed in their _voyage_ (if it may be so designated) for  lack of water. The prospect of the chateau, or palace, embosomed in  trees, and the park variegated with natural and artificial beauties,  with the adjoining village on a steep, shelving hill--is unusually  picturesque. On the present occasion, however, the principal attraction  was the fete, which reminded me more forcibly of John Bunyan's Vanity  Fair, than any other exhibition I had ever witnessed.    The entrance to this motley scene was by the principal gate, where the  carriages set down their company, and at a short distance along the bank  of the river, the steam-boat in like manner"]]]
