Seton Pasha!\"    The frown disappeared from Gray's forehead, and he gripped the other's  hand in hearty greeting. But:    \"Stick to plain Seton!\" said the new-comer, glancing rapidly about him.  \"Ottoman titles are not fashionable.\"    The speaker was a man of arresting personality. Above medium height,  well but leanly built, the face of Seton \"Pasha\" was burned to a deeper  shade than England's wintry sun is capable of producing. He wore a  close-trimmed beard and moustache, and the bronze on his cheeks enhanced  the brightness of his grey eyes and rendered very noticeable a slight  frosting of the dark hair above his temples. He had the indescribable  air of a \"sure\" man, a sound man to have beside one in a tight place;  and looking into the rather grim face, Quentin Gray felt suddenly  ashamed of himself. From Seton Pasha he knew that he could keep nothing  back. He knew that presently he should find himself telling this quiet,  brown-skinned man the whole story of his humiliation--and he knew that  Seton would not spare his feelings.    \"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"you must pardon me if I sometimes fail to  respect your wishes in this matter. When I left the East the name of  Seton Pasha was on everybody's tongue. But are you alone?\"    \"I am. I only arrived in London tonight and in England this morning.\"    \"Were you thinking of dining here?\"    \"No; I saw you through the doorway as I was passing. But this will do  as well as another place. I gather that you are disengaged. Perhaps you  will dine with me?\"    \"Splendid!\" cried Gray. \"Wait a moment. Perhaps my table hasn't gone!\"    He ran off in his boyish, impetuous fashion, and Seton watched him,  smiling quietly.    The table proved to be available, and ere long the two were discussing  an excellent dinner. Gray lost much of his irritability and began to  talk coherently upon topics of general interest. Presently, following an  interval during which he had been covertly watching his companion:    \"Do you know, Seton,\" he said, \"you are the one man in London whose  company I could have tolerated tonight.\"    \"My arrival was peculiarly opportune.\"    \"Your arrivals are always peculiarly opportune.\" Gray stared at Seton  with an expression of puzzled admiration. \"I don't think I shall ever  understand your turning up immediately before the Senussi raid in Egypt.  Do you remember? I was with the armored cars.\"    \"I remember perfectly.\"    \"Then you vanished in the same mysterious fashion, and the C. O. was  a sphinx on the subject. I next saw you strolling out of the gate at  Baghdad. How the devil you'd got to Baghdad, considering that you didn't  come with us and that you weren't with the cavalry, heaven only knows!\"    \"No,\" said Seton judicially, gazing through his uplifted wine-glass;  \"when one comes to consider the matter without prejudice it is certainly  odd. But do I know the lady to whose non-appearance I owe the pleasure  of your company tonight?\"    Quentin Gray stared at him blankly.    \"Really, Seton, you amaze me. Did I say that I had an appointment with a  lady?\"    \"My dear Gray, when I see a man standing biting his nails and glaring  out into Piccadilly from a restaurant entrance I ask myself a question.  When I learn that he has just cancelled an order for a table for two I  answer it.\"    Gray laughed. \"You always make me feel so infernally young, Seton.\"    \"Good!\"    \"Yes, it's good to feel young, but bad to feel a young fool; and that's  what I feel--and what I am. Listen!\"    Leaning across the table so that the light of the shaded lamp fell fully  upon his flushed, eager face, Gray, not without embarrassment, told his  companion of the \"dirty trick\"--so he phrased it--which Sir Lucien Pyne  had played upon him. In conclusion:    \"What would you do, Seton?\" he asked.    Seton sat regarding him in silence with a cool, calculating stare which  some men had termed insolent, absently tapping his teeth with the gold  rim of a monocle which he carried but apparently never used for any  other purpose; and it was at about this time that a long low car  passed near the door of the restaurant, crossing the traffic stream of  Piccadilly to draw up at the corner of old Bond Street.    From the car Monte Irvin alighted and, telling the man to wait, set out  on foot. Ten paces along Bond Street he encountered a small, stooping  figure which became detached from the shadows of a shop door. The light  of a street lamp shone down upon the sharp, hooked nose and into the  cunning little brown eyes of Brisley, of Spinker's Detective Agency.  Monte Irvin started.    \"Ah, Brisley!\" he said, \"I was looking for you. Are they still there?\"    \"Probably, sir.\" Brisley licked his lips. \"My colleague, Gunn, reports  no one came out whilst I was away 'phoning.\"    \"But the whole thing seems preposterous. Are there no other offices in  the block where they might be?\"    \"I personally saw Mr. Gray, Sir Lucien Pyne and the lady go into  Kazmah's. At that time--roughly, ten to seven--all the other offices had  been closed, approximately, one hour.\"    \"There is absolutely no possibility that they might have come out unseen  by you?\"    \"None, sir. I should not have troubled a client if in doubt. Here's  Gunn.\"    Old Bond Street now was darkened and deserted; the yellow mist had  turned to fine rain, and Gunn, his hands thrust in his pockets, was  sheltering under the porch of the arcade. Gunn possessed a purple  complexion which attained to full vigor of coloring in the nasal region.  His moustache of dirty grey was stained brown in the centre as if by  frequent potations of stout, and his bulky figure was artificially  enlarged by the presence of two overcoats, the outer of which was a  waterproof and the inner a blue garment appreciably longer both in  sleeve and skirt than the former. The effect produced was one of great  novelty. Gunn touched the brim of his soft felt hat, which he wore  turned down all round apparently in imitation of a flower-pot.    \"All snug, sir,\" he said, hoarsely and confidentially, bending forward  and breathing the words into Irvin's ear. \"Snug as a bee in a hive.  You're as good as a bachelor again.\"    Monte Irvin mentally recoiled.    \"Lead the way to the door of this place,\" he said tersely.    \"Yes, sir, this way, sir. Be careful of the step there. You may remark  that the outer door is not yet closed. I am informed upon reliable  authority as the last to go locks the door. Hence we perceive that the  last has not yet gone. It is likewise opened by the first to come of a  mornin'. Here we are, sir; door on the right.\"    The landing was in darkness, but as Gunn spoke he directed the ray of a  pocket lamp upon a bronze plate bearing the name \"Kazmah.\" He rested one  hand upon his hip.    \"All snug,\" he repeated; \"as snug as a eel in mud. The decree nisi is  yours, sir. As an alderman of the City of London and a Justice of the  Peace you are entitled to call a police officer--\"    \"Hold your tongue!\" rapped Irvin. \"You've been drinking: and I place no  reliance whatever in your evidence. I do not believe that my wife or any  one else but ourselves is upon these premises.\"    The watery eyes of the insulted man protruded unnaturally. \"Drinkin'!\"  he whispered, \"drink--\"    But indignation now deprived Gunn of speech and:    \"Excuse me, sir,\" interrupted the nasal voice of Brisley, \"but I can  absolutely answer for Gunn. Reputation of the Agency at stake. Worked  with us for three years. Parties undoubtedly on the premises as  reported.\"    \"Drink--\" whispered Gunn.    \"I shall be glad,\" said Monte Irvin, and his voice shook emotionally,  \"if you will lend me your pocket lamp. I am naturally upset. Will you  kindly both go downstairs. I will call if I want you.\"    The two men obeyed, Gunn muttering hoarsely to Brisley; and Monte Irvin  was left standing on the landing, the lamp in his hand. He waited until  he knew from the sound of their footsteps that the pair had regained the  street, then, resting his arm against the closed door, and pressing  his forehead to the damp sleeve of his coat, he stood awhile, the lamp,  which he held limply, shining down upon the floor.    His lips moved, and almost inaudibly he murmured his wife's name.        CHAPTER V. THE DOOR IS OPENED    Quentin Gray and Seton strolled out of Prince's and both paused whilst  Seton lighted a long black cheroot.    \"It seems a pity to waste that box,\" said Gray. \"Suppose we look in at  the Gaiety for an hour?\"    His humor was vastly improved, and he watched the passing throngs with  an expression more suited to his boyish good looks than that of anger  and mortification which had rested upon him an hour earlier.    Seton Pasha tossed a match into the road.    \"My official business is finished for the day,\" he replied. \"I place  myself unreservedly in your hands.\"    \"Well, then,\" began Gray--and paused.    A long, low car, the chauffeur temporarily detained by the stoppage of a  motorbus ahead, had slowed up within three yards of the spot where they  were standing. Gray seized Seton's arm in a fierce grip.    \"Seton,\" he said, his voice betraying intense excitement, \"Look! There  is Monte Irvin!\"    \"In the car?\"    \"Yes, yes! But--he has two police with him! Seton, what can it mean?\"    The car moved away, swinging to the right across the traffic stream  and clearly heading for old Bond Street. Quentin Gray's mercurial color  deserted him, and he turned to Seton a face grown suddenly pale.    \"Good God,\" he whispered, \"something has happened to Rita!\"    Neglectful of his personal safety, he plunged "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#4)"],[1,"it  was definitely horrible--revolting, yet stimulating.    \"You have the pistol,\" added Smith--\"follow closely, and quietly.\"    He walked across the tops of the casks and leaped down, pointing to that  nearest to the closed door of the house. I helped him place it under the  open window. A second we set beside it, and, not without some noise, got  a third on top.    Smith mounted.    His jaw muscles were very prominent and his eyes shone like steel; but  he was as cool as though he were about to enter a theater and not the  den of the most stupendous genius who ever worked for evil. I would  forgive any man who, knowing Dr. Fu-Manchu, feared him; I feared him  myself--feared him as one fears a scorpion; but when Nayland Smith  hauled himself up on the wooden ledge above the door and swung thence  into the darkened room, I followed and was in close upon his heels. But  I admired him, for he had every ampere of his self-possession in hand;  my own case was different.    He spoke close to my ear.    \"Is your hand steady? We may have to shoot.\"    I thought of Karamaneh, of lovely dark-eyed Karamaneh whom this  wonderful, evil product of secret China had stolen from me--for so I now  adjudged it.    \"Rely upon me!\" I said grimly. \"I...\"    The words ceased--frozen on my tongue.    There are things that one seeks to forget, but it is my lot often to  remember the sound which at that moment literally struck me rigid with  horror. Yet it was only a groan; but, merciful God! I pray that it may  never be my lot to listen to such a groan again.    Smith drew a sibilant breath.    \"It's Eltham!\" he whispered hoarsely--\"they're torturing--\"    \"No, no!\" screamed a woman's voice--a voice that thrilled me anew, but  with another emotion--    \"Not that, not--\"    I distinctly heard the sound of a blow. Followed a sort of vague  scuffling. A door somewhere at the back of the house opened--and shut  again. Some one was coming along the passage toward us!    \"Stand back!\" Smith's voice was low, but perfectly steady. \"Leave it to  me!\"    Nearer came the footsteps and nearer. I could hear suppressed sobs. The  door opened, admitting again the faint light--and Karamaneh came in. The  place was quite unfurnished, offering no possibility of hiding; but to  hide was unnecessary.    Her slim figure had not crossed the threshold ere Smith had his arm  about the girl's waist and one hand clapped to her mouth. A stifled gasp  she uttered, and he lifted her into the room.    I stepped forward and closed the door. A faint perfume stole to my  nostrils--a vague, elusive breath of the East, reminiscent of strange  days that, now, seemed to belong to a remote past. Karamaneh! that  faint, indefinable perfume was part of her dainty personality; it may  appear absurd--impossible--but many and many a time I had dreamt of it.    \"In my breast pocket,\" rapped Smith; \"the light.\"    I bent over the girl as he held her. She was quite still, but I could  have wished that I had had more certain mastery of myself. I took the  torch from Smith's pocket, and, mechanically, directed it upon the  captive.    She was dressed very plainly, wearing a simple blue skirt, and white  blouse. It was easy to divine that it was she whom Eltham had mistaken  for a French maid. A brooch set with a ruby was pinned at the point  where the blouse opened--gleaming fierily and harshly against the soft  skin. Her face was pale and her eyes wide with fear.    \"There is some cord in my right-hand pocket,\" said Smith; \"I came  provided. Tie her wrists.\"    I obeyed him, silently. The girl offered no resistance, but I think  I never essayed a less congenial task than that of binding her white  wrists. The jeweled fingers lay quite listlessly in my own.    \"Make a good job of it!\" rapped Smith, significantly.    A flush rose to my cheeks, for I knew well enough what he meant.    \"She is fastened,\" I said, and I turned the ray of the torch upon her  again.    Smith removed his hand from her mouth but did not relax his grip of her.  She looked up at me with eyes in which I could have sworn there was no  recognition. But a flush momentarily swept over her face, and left it  pale again.    \"We shall have to--gag her--\"    \"Smith, I can't do it!\"    The girl's eyes filled with tears and she looked up at my companion  pitifully.    \"Please don't be cruel to me,\" she whispered, with that soft accent  which always played havoc with my composure. \"Every one--every one-is  cruel to me. I will promise--indeed I will swear, to be quiet. Oh,  believe me, if you can save him I will do nothing to hinder you.\" Her  beautiful head drooped. \"Have some pity for me as well.\"    \"Karamaneh\" I said. \"We would have believed you once. We cannot, now.\"    She started violently.    \"You know my name!\" Her voice was barely audible. \"Yet I have never seen  you in my life--\"    \"See if the door locks,\" interrupted Smith harshly.    Dazed by the apparent sincerity in the voice of our lovely  captive--vacant from wonder of it all--I opened the door, felt for, and  found, a key.    We left Karamaneh crouching against the wall; her great eyes were turned  towards me fascinatedly. Smith locked the door with much care. We began  a tip-toed progress along the dimly lighted passage.    From beneath a door on the left, and near the end, a brighter light  shone. Beyond that again was another door. A voice was speaking in the  lighted room; yet I could have sworn that Karamaneh had come, not from  there but from the room beyond--from the far end of the passage.    But the voice!--who, having once heard it, could ever mistake that  singular voice, alternately guttural and sibilant!    Dr. Fu-Manchu was speaking!    \"I have asked you,\" came with ever-increasing clearness (Smith had begun  to turn the knob), \"to reveal to me the name of your correspondent in  Nan-Yang. I have suggested that he may be the Mandarin Yen-Sun-Yat, but  you have declined to confirm me. Yet I know\" (Smith had the door open  a good three inches and was peering in) \"that some official, some high  official, is a traitor. Am I to resort again to the question to learn  his name?\"    Ice seemed to enter my veins at the unseen inquisitor's intonation of  the words \"the question.\" This was the Twentieth Century, yet there, in  that damnable room...    Smith threw the door open.    Through a sort of haze, born mostly of horror, but not entirely, I saw  Eltham, stripped to the waist and tied, with his arms upstretched, to a  rafter in the ancient ceiling. A Chinaman who wore a slop-shop blue suit  and who held an open knife in his hand, stood beside him. Eltham was  ghastly white. The appearance of his chest puzzled me momentarily, then  I realized that a sort of tourniquet of wire-netting was screwed so  tightly about him that the flesh swelled out in knobs through the mesh.  There was blood--    \"God in heaven!\" screamed Smith frenziedly--\"they have the wire-jacket  on him! Shoot down that damned Chinaman, Petrie! Shoot! Shoot!\"    Lithely as a cat the man with the knife leaped around--but I raised the  Browning, and deliberately--with a cool deliberation that came to me  suddenly--shot him through the head. I saw his oblique eyes turn up to  the whites; I saw the mark squarely between his brows; and with no word  nor cry he sank to his knees and toppled forward with one yellow hand  beneath him and one outstretched, clutching--clutching--convulsively.  His pigtail came unfastened and began to uncoil, slowly, like a snake.    I handed the pistol to Smith; I was perfectly cool, now; and I leaped  forward, took up the bloody knife from the floor and cut Eltham's  lashings. He sank into my arms.    \"Praise God,\" he murmured, weakly. \"He is more merciful to me than  perhaps I deserve. Unscrew... the jacket, Petrie... I think ... I was  very near to.... weakening. Praise the good God, Who... gave me...  fortitude...\"    I got the screw of the accursed thing loosened, but the act of removing  the jacket was too agonizing for Eltham--man of iron though he was. I  laid him swooning on the floor.    \"Where is Fu-Manchu?\"    Nayland Smith, from just within the door, threw out the query in a tone  of stark amaze. I stood up--I could do nothing more for the poor victim  at the moment--and looked about me. The room was innocent of furniture,  save for heaps of rubbish on the floor, and a tin oil-lamp hung, on  the wall. The dead Chinaman lay close beside Smith. There was no second  door, the one window was barred, and from this room we had heard the  voice, the unmistakable, unforgettable voice, of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    But Dr. Fu-Manchu was not there!    Neither of us could accept the fact for a moment; we stood there,  looking from the dead man to the tortured man who only swooned, in a  state of helpless incredulity.    Then the explanation flashed upon us both, simultaneously, and with a  cry of baffled rage Smith leaped along the passage to the second door.  It was wide open. I stood at his elbow when he swept its emptiness with  the ray of his pocket-lamp.    There was a speaking-tube fixed between the two rooms!    Smith literally ground his teeth.    \"Yet, Petrie,\" he said, \"we have learnt something. Fu-Manchu had  evidently promised Eltham his life if he would divulge the name of  his correspondent. He meant to keep his word; it is a sidelight on his  character.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Eltham has never seen Dr. Fu-Manchu, but Eltham knows certain parts of  China better than you know the Strand. Probably, if he saw Fu-Manchu, he  would recognize him for who he really is, and this, it seems, the Doctor  is anxious to avoid.\"    We ran back to where we had left Karamaneh.    The room was empty!    \"Defeated, Petrie!\" said Smith, bitterly. \"The Yellow Devil is loosed on  London again!\"    He leaned from the window and the skirl of a police whistle split the  stillness of the night.
