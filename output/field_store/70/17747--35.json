[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#4)"],[1," given  you a little food for thought at this point, in connection with the  Mind of the Absolute.    So you see, good friends and students, that the Intellect in its  highest efforts, informs us that it finds itself compelled to report  that the One--the Absolute--That which it is compelled to admit really  exists--must be a One possessed of a nature so far transcending human  experience that the human mind finds itself without the proper  concepts, symbols, and words with which to think of It. But none the  less, the Intellect finds itself bound by its own laws to postulate the  existence of such an One.    It is the veriest folly to try to think of the One as It is \"in  Itself\"--for we have nothing but human attributes with which to measure  it, and It so far transcends such measurements that the mental  yard-sticks run out into infinity and are lost sight of. The highest  minds of the race inform us that the most exalted efforts of their  reason compels them to report that the One--in Itself--cannot be spoken  of as possessing attributes or qualities capable of being expressed in  human words employed to describe the Things of the relative world--and  all of our words are such. All of our words originate from such ideas,  and all of our ideas arise from our experience, directly or indirectly.  So we are not equipped with words with which to think of or speak of  that which transcends experience, although our Intellect informs us  that Reality lies back of our experience.    Philosophy finds itself unable to do anything better than to bring us  face to face with high paradoxes. Science in its pursuit of Truth finds  it cunningly avoiding it, and ever escaping its net. And we believe  that the Absolute purposely causes this to be, that in the end Man may  be compelled to look for the Spirit within himself--the only place  where he can come in touch with it. This, we think, is the answer to  the Riddle of the Sphinx--\"Look Within for that which Thou needest.\"    But while the Spirit may be discerned only by looking within ourselves,  we find that once the mind realizes that the Absolute Is, it will be  able to see countless evidences of its action and presence by observing  manifested Life without. All Life is filled with the Life Power and  Will of the Absolute.    To us Life is but One--the Universe is a living Unity, throbbing,  thrilling and pulsating with the Will-to-Live of the Absolute. Back of  all apparent shapes, forms, names, forces, elements, principles and  substances, there is but One--One Life, present everywhere, and  manifesting in an infinitude of shapes, forms, and forces All  individual lives are but centers of consciousness in the One Life  underlying, depending upon it for degree of unfoldment, expression and  manifestation.    This may sound like Pantheism to some, but it is very different from  the Pantheism of the schools and cults. Pantheism is defined as \"the  doctrine that God consists in the combined forces and laws manifested  in the existing Universe,\" or that \"the Universe taken or conceived as  a whole is God.\" These definitions do not fit the conception of the  Absolute, of the Yogi Philosophy--they seem to breathe but a refined  materialism. The Absolute is not \"the combined forces and laws  manifested in the universe,\" nor \"the universe conceived as a whole.\"  Instead, the Universe, its forces and laws, even conceived as a whole,  have no existence in themselves, but are mere manifestations of the  Absolute. Surely this is different from Pantheism.    We teach that the Absolute is immanent in, and abiding in all forms of  Life in the Universe, as well as in its forces and laws--all being but  manifestations of the Will of the One. And we teach that this One is  superior to all forms of manifestations, and that Its existence and  being does not depend upon the manifestations, which are but effects of  the Cause.    The Pantheistic Universe--God is but a thing of phenomenal appearance,  but the Absolute is the very Spirit of Life--a Living, Existing  Reality, and would be so even if every manifestation were withdrawn  from appearance and expression--drawn back into the source from which  it emanated. The Absolute is more than Mountain or Ocean--Electricity  or Gravitation--Monad or Man--It is SPIRIT--LIFE--BEING--REALITY--the  ONE THAT IS. Omnipotent, Omnipresent; Omniscient; Eternal; Infinite;  Absolute; these are Man's greatest words, and yet they but feebly  portray a shadow thrown by the One Itself.    The Absolute is not a far-away Being directing our affairs at long  range--not an absentee Deity--but an Immanent Life in and about us  all--manifesting in us and creating us into individual centers of  consciousness, in pursuance with some great law of being.    And, more than this, the Absolute instead of being an indifferent and  unmoved spectator to its own creation, is a thriving, longing, active,  suffering, rejoicing, feeling Spirit, partaking of the feelings of its  manifestations, rather than callously witnessing them. It lives in  us--with us--through us. Back of all the pain in the world may be found  a great feeling and suffering love. The pain of the world is not  punishment or evidence of divine wrath, but the incidents of the  working out of some cosmic plan, in which the Absolute is the Actor,  through the forms of Its manifestations.    The message of the Absolute to some of the Illumined has been, \"All is  being done in the best and only possible way--I am doing the best I  can--all is well--and in the end will so appear.\"    The Absolute is no personal Deity--yet in itself it contains all that  goes to make up all personality and all human relations. Father,  Mother, Child, Friend, is in It. All forms of human love and craving  for sympathy, understanding and companionship may find refuge in loving  the Absolute.    The Absolute is constantly in evidence in our lives, and yet we have  been seeking it here and there in the outer world, asking it to show  itself and prove Its existence. Well may it say to us: \"Hast thou been  so long time with me, and hast thou not known me?\" This is the great  tragedy of Life, that the Spirit comes to us--Its own--and we know It  not. We fail to hear Its words: \"Oh, ye who mourn, I suffer with you  and through you. Yea, it is I who grieve in you. Your pain is mine--to  the last pang. I suffer all pain through you--and yet I rejoice beyond  you, for I know that through you, and with you, I shall conquer.\"    And this is a faint idea of what we believe the Absolute to be. In the  following lessons we shall see it in operation in all forms of life,  and in ourselves. We shall get close to the workings of Its mighty  Will--close to Its Heart of Love.    Carry with you the Central Thought of the Lesson: CENTRAL THOUGHT.  There is but One Life in the Universe. And underlying that One  Life--Its Real Self--Its Essence--Its Spirit--is The Absolute, living,  feeling, suffering, rejoicing, longing, striving, in and through us.  The Absolute is all that really Is, and all the visible Universe and  forms of Life is Its expression, through Its Will. We lack words  adequate to describe the nature of the Absolute, but we will use two  words describing its inmost nature as best we see it. These two words  are LIFE and LOVE, the one describing the outer, the other the inner  nature. Let us manifest both Life and Love as a token of our origin and  inner nature. Peace be with you.          THE SECOND LESSON      OMNIPRESENT LIFE.    In our First Lesson of this series, we brought out the idea that the  human mind was compelled to report the fact that it could not think of  The Absolute except as possessing the quality of  Omnipresence--Present-Everywhere. And, likewise, the human mind is  compelled to think that all there IS must be The Absolute, or _of_ the  Absolute. And if a thing is _of_ the Absolute, then the Absolute must  be _in_ it, in some way--must be the _essence_ of it. Granting this, we  must then think that everything must be filled with the essence of  Life, for Life must be one of the qualities of the Absolute, or rather  what we call Life must be the outward expression of the essential Being  of the Absolute. And if this be so, then it would follow that  _everything in the Universe must be Alive_. The mind cannot escape this  conclusion. And if the facts do not bear out this conclusion then we  must be forced to admit that the entire basic theory of the Absolute  and its emanations must fall, and be considered as an error. No chain  is stronger than its weakest link, and if this link be too weak to bear  the weight of the facts of the universe, then must the chain be  discarded as imperfect and useless, and another substituted. This fact  is not generally mentioned by those speaking and writing of All being  One, or an emanation of the One, but it must be considered and met. If  there is a single thing in the Universe that is  \"dead\"--non-living--lifeless--then the theory must fall. If a thing is  non-living, then the essence of the Absolute cannot be in it--it must  be alien and foreign to the Absolute, and in that case the Absolute  cannot be Absolute for there is something outside of itself. And so it  becomes of the greatest importance to examine into the evidences of the  presence of Life in all things, organic or inorganic. The evidence is  at hand--let us examine it.    The ancient occultists of all peoples always taught that the Universe  was Alive--that there was Life in everything--that there was nothing  dead in Nature--that Death meant simply a change in form in the  material of the dead bodies. They taught that Life, in varying degrees  of manifestation and expression, was present in everything and object,  even down to the hardest mineral form, and the atoms composing that  form.    Modern Science is now rapidly advancing to the same position, and each  months investigations and discoveries serve only to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13439"],[0,"Divine Songs (#4)"],[1," around my head.    4 With cheerful heart I close mine eyes,  Since thou wilt not remove;  And in the morning let me rise  Rejoicing in thy love.      Song 27.  _For the Lord's Day Morning_.    1 This is the day when Christ arose  So early from the dead:  Why should I my eyelids close,  And waste my hours in bed?    2 This is the day when Jesus broke  The powers of death and hell;  And shall I still wear Satan's yoke,  And love my sins so well?    3 To-day, with pleasure, Christians meet,  To pray, and hear thy Word;  And I would go with cheerful feet  To learn thy will, O Lord!    4 I'll leave my sport, to read and pray,  And so prepare for heaven:  O may I love this blessed day  The best of all the seven!      Song 28.  _For Lord's Day Evening_.    1 Lord, how delightful `tis to see  A whole assembly worship thee!  At once they sing, at once they pray;  They hear of heaven, and learn the way.    2 I have been there, and still would go  'Tis like a little heaven below!  Not all my pleasure and my play  Should tempt me to forget this day.    3 O write upon my memory, Lord,  The text and doctrines of thy Word,  That I may break thy laws no more,  But love thee better than before!    4 With thoughts of Christ and things divine  Fill up this foolish heart of mine:  That, hoping pardon through his blood,  I may lie down, and wake with God.      The TEN COMMANDMENTS out of the Old Testament put into short  Rhime for Children.    Exod. 20.    1. Thou shalt have no more Gods but me.  2. Before no idol bow thy knee.  3. Take not the Name of God in vain:  4. Nor dare the Sabbath Day profane.  5. Give both thy parents honour due.  6. Take heed that thou no murder do.  7. Abstain from words and deeds unclean:  8. Nor steal, though thou art poor and mean.  9. Nor make a wilful lie, nor love it.  10. What is thy neighbour's, dare not covet.      The Sum of the Commandments out of the New Testament.    Matt. 22. 37.    With all thy Soul love God above;  And as thyself thy Neighbour love.      Our Saviour's Golden Rule.    Matt. 7. 12.    Be you to others Kind and True,  As you'd have others be to you.  And neither do nor say to Men  Whate'er you would not take again.      Duty to God and our neighbour.    Love God with all your Soul and Strength.  With all your Heart and Mind;  And love your Neighbour as your self:  Be faithful, just, and kind.    Deal with another as you'd have  Another deal with you.  What you're unwilling to receive,  Be sure you never do.      Out of my Book of _Hymns_, I have here added, the _Hosanna_ and  _Glory to the Father_, &c. to be sung at the end of any of these  Songs, according to the Direction of Parents or Governors.      The _Hosanna_; or Salvation ascribed to Christ.    Long Metre.    1 _Hosanna_ to king _David's_ Son,  Who reigns on a superior Throne;  We bless the Prince of Heav'nly Birth,  Who brings Salvation down to Earth.    2 Let every nation, every age,  In this delightful work engage;  Old Men and Babes in _Sion_ sing  The growing glories of her King!      Common Metre.    1 _Hosanna_ to the Prince of Grace;  _Sion_ behold thy King;  Proclaim the Son of _David's_ Race,  And teach the Babes to sing.    2 _Hosanna_ to th' Eternal Word,  Who from the Father came;  Ascribe Salvation to the Lord,  With Blessings on his Name!      Short Metre.    1 _Hosanna_ to the Son  Of _David_ and of God,  Who brought the News of Pardon down,  And bought it with his Blood.    2 To Christ, th' anointed King,  Be endless blessings giv'n,  Let the whole Earth his Glory sing  Who made our Peace with Heav'n.      Glory to the Father and the Son, &c.    Long Metre.    To God the Father, God the Son,  And God the Spirit, Three in One,  Be Honour, Praise, and Glory giv'n,  By all on Earth, and all in Heav'n.      Common Metre.    Now let the Father and the Son,  And Spirit be ador'd,  Where there are works to make him known,  Or saints to love the Lord.      Short Metre.    Give to the Father Praise,  Give Glory to the Son,  And to the Spirit of his Grace  Be equal Honour done.          A Slight SPECIMEN of MORAL SONGS,    _Such as I wish some happy and condescending Genius would undertake  for the use of Children, and perform much better_.    The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the  _Proverbs of Solomon_, from all the common appearances of nature,  from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country:  (which would also afford matter for other divine songs). Here the  language and measures should be easy and flowing with cheerfulness,  and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names  of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit  together.    This would be one effectual way to deliver them from the temptation  of loving and learning those idle, wanton or profane songs, which  give so early an ill taint to the fancy and memory, and become  the seeds of future vices.      _The Sluggard_.    1 'Tis the voice of the Sluggard. I heard him complain  \"You have waked me too soon! I must slumber again!\"  As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed,  Turns his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.    2 \"A little more sleep, and a little more slumber;\"  Thus he wastes half his days, and his hours without number:  And when he gets up, he sits folding his hands  Or walks about sauntering, or trifling he stands.    3 I past by his garden, and saw the wild bryar  The thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher:  The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags;  And his money still wasts, still he starves, or he begs.    4 I made him a visit, still hoping to find  He had took better care for improving his mind:  He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking,  But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.    5 Said I then to my heart, \"Here's a lesson for me,\"  That man's but a picture of what I might be:  But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding:  Who taught me betimes to love working and reading!      _Innocent Play_.    1 Abroad in the meadows to see the young lambs,  Run sporting about by the side of their dams  With fleeces so clean, and so white;  Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage,  When they play all in love without anger or rage,  How much may we learn from the sight!    2 If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud:  Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood;  So foul, or so fierce are their natures.  But Thomas and William, and such pretty names,  Should be cleanly and harmless as doves, or as lambs,  Those lovely sweet innocent creatures.    3 Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say,  Should injure another in jesting or play;  For he's still in earnest that's hurt.  How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire!  There's none but a mad-man will fling about fire,  And tell you, \"`Tis all but in sport.\"      The End.      The TABLE.     1. A General Song of Praise to God.   2. Praise for Creation and Providence.   3. Praise to God for our Redemption.   4. Praise for mercies Spiritual and Temporal.   5.

Duty to God and our Neighbour.      The Hosanna in Long Metre.                  in Common Metre.                  in Short Metre.      Glory to the Father in Long Metre.                          in Common Metre.                          in Short Metre.    A slight Specimen of Moral Songs, viz.      The Sluggard.      Innocent Play.          The End of the Table.        ADDENDUM to the Moral Songs.      Transcriber's Note.    In the 1715 edition, for the reasons explained by Watts in his  Preface, there are only two moral songs, namely \"The Sluggard\" and  \"Innocent Play.\" Those added later are included in this Addendum.  The texts are from an 1866 printing in New York, posted into the  public domain by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) at    http://www.ccel.org/ccel/watts/divsongs.html        Song 3.  The Rose.  12,8,12,8    How fair is the Rose! what a beautiful flower!  The glory of April and May:  But the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour,  And they wither and die in a day.    Yet the Rose has one powerful virtue to boast,  Above all the flowers of the field!  When its leaves are all dead and fine colours are lost,  Still how sweet a perfume it will yield!    So frail is the youth and the beauty of man,  Though they bloom and look gay like the Rose;  But all our fond care to preserve them is vain,  Time kills them as fast as he goes.    Then I'll not be proud of my youth and my beauty,  Since both of them wither and fade;  But gain a good name by well doing my duty:  This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.      Song 4.  The thief  8,7,8,7    Why should I deprive my neighbour  Of his goods against his will?  Hands were made for honest labour,  Not to plunder, or to steal.    'Tis a foolish self-deceiving  By such tricks to hope for gain:    All that's ever got by thieving  Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.    Have not Eve and Adam taught us  Their sad profit to compute,  To what dismal state they brought us  When they stole forbidden fruit?    Oft we"]]]
