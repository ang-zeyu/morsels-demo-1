The emperors reigned despotically, but under the forms of legislation.  Nor did they attempt to subvert laws which did not interfere with their  own political power. What is called jurisprudence they even improved, as  that later imperial despot Napoleon gave a code to the nation he ruled.  It is this science of jurisprudence, for which the Romans had a genius,  that gives them their highest claim to be ranked among the benefactors  of mankind. They created legal science. Its aim was justice,--equity in  the relations between man and man. This was the pride of the Roman  world, even under the rule of tyrants and madmen, and this has survived  all the calamities of fifteen hundred years. The Roman laws--founded by  the Republic, but symmetrically completed by the Empire--have more  powerfully affected the interests of civilization than have the  philosophy and arts of Greece. Roman jurisprudence was not perfectly  developed until five hundred years after the Christian era, when  Justinian consolidated it into the Code, the Pandects, and the  Institutes. The classical jurists, like Gaius, Ulpian, and Paulus, may  have laid the foundation, but the superstructure was raised under the  auspices of the imperial despots.    The earliest code of Roman laws was called the Twelve Tables, framed  from the report of the commissioners sent to Athens and other Greek  States, to collect what was most useful in their legal systems. The laws  of the Twelve Tables were the basis of all the Roman laws, civil and  religious. But the edicts of the praetors, who were the great equity  judges as well as the common-law magistrates, proclaimed certain changes  which custom and the practice of the courts had introduced; and these,  added to the _leges populi_, or laws proposed by the consul and passed  by the centuries, the _plebiscita_, or laws proposed by the tribunes  and passed by the tribes, and the _senatus consulta,_ or decrees of the  senate, gradually swelled the laws to a great number. Three thousand  engraved plates of brass containing these various laws were deposited in  the capitol.    Subtleties and fictions were in the course of litigations introduced by  the lawyers to defeat the written statutes, and jurisprudence became  complicated as early as the time of Cicero. Even the opinions of eminent  lawyers were adopted by the legal profession as authoritative, and were  recognized by the courts. The evils of a complicated jurisprudence were  so evident in the seventh century of the city, that Q. Mucius Scaevola,  a great lawyer, when consul, published a scientific elaboration of the  civil law. Cicero studied law under him, and his contemporaries, Varus  and Aelius Gallus, wrote learned treatises, from which extracts appear  in the Digest made under the Emperor Justinian, 528 A.D. Julius Caesar  contemplated a complete revision of the laws, but did not live long  enough to carry out his intentions. His legislation, so far as he  directed his mind to it, was very just. Among other laws established by  him was one which ordained that creditors should accept lands as payment  for their outstanding debts, according to the value determined by  commissioners. In his time the relative value of money had changed, and  was greatly diminished. The most important law of Augustus, deserving of  all praise, was that which related to the manumission of slaves; but he  did not interfere with the social relations of the people after he had  deprived them of political liberty. He once attempted, by his _Lex  Julia_, to counteract the custom which then prevailed, of abstaining  from legal marriage and substituting concubinage instead, by which the  free population declined; but this attempt to improve the morals of the  people met with such opposition from the tribes and centuries that the  next emperor abolished popular assemblies altogether, which Augustus had  feared to do. The senate in the time of the emperors, composed chiefly  of lawyers and magistrates, and entirely dependent upon them, became the  great fountain of law. By the original constitution the people were the  source of power, and the senate merely gave or refused its approbation  to the laws proposed; but under the emperors the _comitia_, or popular  assemblies, disappeared, and the senate passed decrees which had the  force of laws, subject to the veto of the Emperor. It was not until the  time of Septimus Severus and Caracalla (second century A.D.) that the  legislative action of the senate ceased, and the edicts and rescripts of  emperors took the place of all legislation.    The golden age of Roman jurisprudence was from the birth of Cicero to  the reign of the Emperor Alexander Severus, 222 A.D.; before this period  it was an occult science, confined to praetors, pontiffs, and patrician  lawyers. But in the latter days of the republic law became the  fashionable study of Roman youth, and eminent masters arose. The first  great lawyer who left behind him important works was Q. Mucius Scaevola,  who wrote a treatise in eighteen books on the civil law. \"He was,\" says  Cicero, \"the most eloquent of jurists and the most learned of orators.\"  This work, George Long thinks, had a great influence on contemporaries  and on subsequent jurists, who followed it as a model. It is the oldest  work from which there are any excerpts in the Digest.    Servius Sulpicius, the friend of Cicero and his fellow-student in  oratory, surpassed his teachers Balbus and Gallus, and was the equal in  reputation of the great Mucius Scaevola, the Pontifex Maximus, who said  it was disgraceful for a patrician and a noble to be ignorant of the law  with which he had to do. Cicero ascribes the great superiority of  Servius as a lawyer to the study of philosophy, which disciplined and  developed his mind, and enabled him to deduce his conclusions from his  premises with logical precision. He left behind him one hundred and  eighty treatises, and had numerous pupils, among whom A. Ofilius and  Alfenus Varus, Cato, Julius Caesar, Antony, and Cicero were great  lawyers. Labeo, in the time of Augustus, wrote four hundred books on  jurisprudence, spending six months in the year in giving instruction to  his pupils and in answering legal questions, and the other six months in  the country in writing books. Like all the great Roman jurists, he was  versed in literature and philosophy, and so devoted to his profession  that he refused political office. His rival Capito was equally learned  in all departments of the law, and left behind him as many treatises as  Labeo. These two jurists were the founders of celebrated schools, like  the ancient philosophers, and each had distinguished followers. Gaius,  who flourished in the time of the Antonines, was a great legal  authority; and the recent discovery of his Institutes has revealed the  least mutilated fragment of Roman jurisprudence which exists, and one of  the most valuable, which sheds great light on ancient Roman law; it was  found in the library of Verona. No Roman jurist had a higher reputation  than Papinian, who was praefectus praetorio under Septimius Severus (193  A.D.),--an office which made him second only to the Emperor, a sort of  grand vizier, whose power extended over all departments of the State; he  was beheaded by Caracalla. The great commentator Cujacius declares that  he was the first of all lawyers who have been, or who are to be; that no  one ever surpassed him in legal knowledge, and no one will ever equal  him. Paulus was his contemporary, and held the same office as Papinian.  He was the most fertile of Roman law-writers, and there is more taken  from him in Justinian's Digest than from any other jurist, except  Ulpian. There are two thousand and eighty-three excerpts from this  writer,--one sixth of the whole Digest. No legal writer, ancient or  modern, has handled so many subjects. In perspicuity he is said to be  inferior to Ulpian, one of the most famous of jurists, who was his  contemporary. Ulpian has also exercised a great influence on modern  jurisprudence from the copious extracts of his writings in the Digest.  He was the chief adviser of Alexander Severus, and like Paulus was  praefectus praetorio. The number of excerpts in the Digest from him is  said to be two thousand four hundred and sixty-two, and they form a  third part of it. Some fragments of his writings remain. The last of the  great civilians associated with Gaius, Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, as  oracles of jurisprudence, was Modestinus, who was a pupil of Ulpian. He  wrote both in Greek and Latin. There are three hundred and forty-five  excerpts in the Digest from his writings, the titles of which show the  extent and variety of his labors.    These eminent lawyers shed great glory on the Roman civilization. In the  earliest times men sought distinction on the fields of battle, but in  the latter days of the republic honor was conferred for forensic  ability. The first pleaders of Rome were not jurisconsults, but  aristocratic \"patrons,\" who looked after their \"clients,\"--men of lower  social grade, who in return for protection and assistance rendered  service, sometimes political by voting, sometimes pecuniary, sometimes  military. But when law became complicated, a class of men arose to  interpret it. These men were held in great honor, and reached by their  services the highest offices,--like Cicero and Hortensius. No  remuneration was given originally for forensic pleading beyond the  services which the client gave to a patron, but gradually the practice  of the law became lucrative. Hortensius, as well as Cicero, gained an  immense fortune; he had several villas, a gallery of paintings, a large  stock of wines, parks, fish-ponds, and aviaries. Cicero had villas in  all parts of Italy, a house on the Palatine with columns of Numidian  marble, and a fortune of twenty millions of sesterces, equal to eight  hundred thousand dollars.

Then to her side  The children came, and clung to her and cried,  And her arms hugged them, and a long good-bye  She gave to each, like one who goes to die.  The whole house then was weeping, every slave  In sorrow for his mistress. And she gave  Her hand to all; aye, none so base was there  She gave him not good words and he to her.    So on Admetus falls from either side  Sorrow. 'Twere bitter grief to him to have died  Himself; and being escaped, how sore a woe  He hath earned instead--Ah, some day he shall know!    LEADER.  Surely Admetus suffers, even to-day,  For this true-hearted love he hath cast away?    MAID.  He weeps; begs her not leave him desolate,  And holds her to his heart--too late, too late!  She is sinking now, and there, beneath his eye  Fading, the poor cold hand falls languidly,  And faint is all her breath. Yet still she fain  Would look once on the sunlight--once again  And never more. I will go in and tell  Thy presence. Few there be, will serve so well  My master and stand by him to the end.  But thou hast been from olden days our friend.                              [_The_ MAID _goes in_.]    CHORUS.    THIRD ELDER.      O Zeus,  What escape and where    From the evil thing?  How break the snare    That is round our King?    SECOND ELDER.      Ah list!  One cometh?... No.    Let us no more wait;      Make dark our raiment        And shear this hair.    LEADER.      Aye, friends!  'Tis so, even so.    Yet the gods are great      And may send allayment.        To prayer, to prayer!    ALL (_praying_).        O Paian wise!  Some healing of this home devise, devise!  Find, find.... Oh, long ago when we were blind    Thine eyes saw mercy ... find some healing breath!  Again, O Paian, break the chains that bind;    Stay the red hand of Death!    LEADER.      Alas!  What shame, what dread,    Thou Pheres' son,  Shalt be harvested    When thy wife is gone!    SECOND ELDER.      Ah me;  For a deed less drear    Than this thou ruest      Men have died for sorrow;        Aye, hearts have bled.    THIRD ELDER.      'Tis she;  Not as men say dear,    But the dearest, truest,      Shall lie ere morrow        Before thee dead!    ALL.      But lo! Once more!  She and her husband moving to the door!  Cry, cry! And thou, O land of Pherae, hearken!    The bravest of women sinketh, perisheth,  Under the green earth, down where the shadows darken,    Down to the House of Death!    [_During the last words_ ADMETUS _and_ ALCESTIS _have entered_.  ALCESTIS _is supported by her Handmaids and followed by her  two children._]    LEADER.  And who hath said that Love shall bring    More joy to man than fear and strife?  I knew his perils from of old,  I know them now, when I behold    The bitter faring of my King,  Whose love is taken, and his life    Left evermore an empty thing.    ALCESTIS.    O Sun, O light of the day that falls!  O running cloud that races along the sky!    ADMETUS.  They look on thee and me, a stricken twain,  Who have wrought no sin that God should have thee slain.    ALCESTIS.    Dear Earth, and House of sheltering walls,  And wedded homes of the land where my fathers lie!    ADMETUS.  Fail not, my hapless one. Be strong, and pray  The o'er-mastering Gods to hate us not alway.    ALCESTIS (_faintly, her mind wandering_).  A boat two-oared, upon water; I see, I see.    And the Ferryman of the Dead,  His hand that hangs on the pole, his voice that cries;  \"Thou lingerest; come. Come quickly, we wait for thee.\"    He is angry that I am slow; he shakes his head.    ADMETUS.  Alas, a bitter boat-faring for me,  My bride ill-starred.--Oh, this is misery!    ALCESTIS (_as before_).  Drawing, drawing! 'Tis some one that draweth me ...    To the Palaces of the Dead.  So dark. The wings, the eyebrows and ah, the eyes!...    Go back! God's mercy! What seekest thou? Let me be!...  (_Recovering_) Where am I? Ah, and what paths are these I tread?    ADMETUS.  Grievous for all who love thee, but for me  And my two babes most hard, most solitary.    ALCESTIS.    Hold me not; let me lie.--  I am too weak to stand; and Death is near,  And a slow darkness stealing on my sight.    My little ones, good-bye.  Soon, soon, and mother will be no more here....  Good-bye, two happy children in the light.    ADMETUS.  Oh, word of pain, oh, sharper ache    Than any death of mine had brought!    For the Gods' sake, desert me not,  For thine own desolate children's sake.  Nay, up! Be brave. For if they rend    Thee from me, I can draw no breath;    In thy hand are my life and death,  Thine, my beloved and my friend!    ALCESTIS.  Admetus, seeing what way my fortunes lie,  I fain would speak with thee before I die.  I have set thee before all things; yea, mine own  Life beside thine was naught. For this alone  I die.... Dear Lord, I never need have died.  I might have lived to wed some prince of pride,  Dwell in a king's house.... Nay, how could I, torn  From thee, live on, I and my babes forlorn?  I have given to thee my youth--not more nor less,  But all--though I was full of happiness.  Thy father and mother both--'tis strange to tell--  Had failed thee, though for them the deed was well,  The years were ripe, to die and save their son,  The one child of the house: for hope was none,  If thou shouldst pass away, of other heirs.  So thou and I had lived through the long years,  Both. Thou hadst not lain sobbing here alone  For a dead wife and orphan babes.... 'Tis done  Now, and some God hath wrought out all his will.    Howbeit I now will ask thee to fulfill  One great return-gift--not so great withal  As I have given, for life is more than all;  But just and due, as thine own heart will tell.  For thou hast loved our little ones as well  As I have.... Keep them to be masters here  In my old house; and bring no stepmother  Upon them. She might hate them. She might be  Some baser woman, not a queen like me,  And strike them with her hand. For mercy, spare  Our little ones that wrong. It is my prayer....  They come into a house: they are all strife  And hate to any child of the dead wife....    Better a serpent than a stepmother!  A boy is safe. He has his father there  To guard him. But a little girl! (_Taking the_ LITTLE GIRL    _to her_) What good  And gentle care will guide thy maidenhood?  What woman wilt thou find at father's side?  One evil word from her, just when the tide  Of youth is full, would wreck thy hope of love.  And no more mother near, to stand above  Thy marriage-bed, nor comfort thee pain-tossed  In travail, when one needs a mother most!  Seeing I must die.... 'Tis here, across my way,  Not for the morrow, not for the third day,  But now--Death, and to lie with things that were.    Farewell. God keep you happy.--Husband dear,  Remember that I failed thee not; and you,  My children, that your mother loved you true.    LEADER.  Take comfort. Ere thy lord can speak, I swear,  If truth is in him, he will grant thy prayer.    ADMETUS.  He will, he will! Oh, never fear for me.  Mine hast thou been, and mine shalt ever be,  Living and dead, thou only. None in wide  Hellas but thou shalt be Admetus' bride.  No race so high, no face so magic-sweet  Shall ever from this purpose turn my feet.  And children ... if God grant me joy of these,  'Tis all I ask; of thee no joy nor ease  He gave me. And thy mourning I will bear  Not one year of my life but every year,  While life shall last.... My mother I will know  No more. My father shall be held my foe.  They brought the words of love but not the deed,  While thou hast given thine all, and in my need  Saved me. What can I do but weep alone,  Alone alway, when such a wife is gone?...    An end shall be of revel, and an end  Of crowns and song and mirth of friend with friend,  Wherewith my house was glad. I ne'er again  Will touch the lute nor ease my heart from pain  With pipes of Afric. All the joys I knew,  And joys were many, thou hast broken in two.  Oh, I will find some artist wondrous wise  Shall mould for me thy shape, thine hair, thine eyes,  And lay it in thy bed; and I will lie  Close, and reach out mine arms to thee, and cry  Thy name into the night, and wait and hear  My own heart breathe: \"Thy love, thy love is near.\"  A cold delight; yet it might ease the sum  Of sorrow.... And good dreams of thee will come  Like balm. 'Tis sweet, even in a dream, to gaze  On a dear face, the moment that it stays.    O God, if Orpheus' voice were mine, to sing  To Death's high Virgin and the Virgin's King,  Till their hearts failed them, down would I my path  Cleave, and naught stay me, not the Hound of Wrath,  Not the grey oarsman of the ghostly tide,  Till back to sunlight I had borne my bride.    But now, wife, wait for me till I shall come  Where thou art, and prepare our second home.  These ministers in that same cedar sweet  Where thou art laid will lay me, feet to feet,  And head to head, oh, not in death from thee  Divided, who alone art true to me!    LEADER.  This life-long sorrow thou hast sworn, I too,  Thy friend, will bear with thee. It is her due.    ALCESTIS.  Children, ye heard his promise? He will wed  No other woman nor forget the dead.    ADMETUS.  Again I promise. So it shall be done.    ALCESTIS (_giving the children into his arms one after the other_).  On that oath take my daughter: and my son.    ADMETUS.  Dear hand that gives, I accept both gift and vow.    ALCESTIS.  Thou, in my place, must be their mother now.    ADMETUS.  Else were they motherless--I needs must try.    ALCESTIS.  My babes, I ought to live, and lo, I die.    ADMETUS.  And how can I, forlorn of thee, live on?    ALCESTIS.  Time healeth; and the dead are dead and gone.    ADMETUS.  Oh, take me with thee to the dark below,  Me also!    ALCESTIS.           'Tis enough that one should go.    ADMETUS.  O Fate, to have cheated me of one so true!    ALCESTIS (_her strength failing_).  There comes a darkness: a great burden, too.    ADMETUS."]]]
