Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy had never  ridden at school, except when he was hoisted; he was, therefore, a very  indifferent horseman; they sent him to the riding-school, and everybody  laughed at him.    \"He is a d--d ass!\" said Cornet Horsephiz, who was very ugly; \"a horrid  puppy!\" said Lieutenant St. Squintem, who was still uglier; \"if he does  not ride better he will disgrace the regiment,\" said Captain Rivalhate,  who was very good-looking; \"if he does not ride better, we will cut  him!\" said Colonel Everdrill, who was a wonderful martinet; \"I say, Mr.  Bumpemwell (to the riding-master,) make that youngster ride less like a  miller's sack.\"    \"Pooh, sir, _he_ will never ride better.\"    \"And why the d---l will he not?\"    \"Bless you, colonel, he is a great deal too handsome for a cavalry  officer!\"    \"True!\" said Cornet Horsephiz.    \"Very true,\" said Lieutenant St. Squintem.    \"We must cut him!\" said the Colonel.    And Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was accordingly cut.    Out hero was a youth of susceptibility--he quitted the ---- regiment,  and challenged the colonel. The colonel was killed!    \"What a terrible blackguard is Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy!\" said the  colonel's relations.    \"Very true!\" said the world.    The parents were in despair!--They were not rich; but our hero was an  only son, and they sponged hard upon the crabbed old uncle! \"he is very  clever,\" said they both, \"and may do yet.\"    So they borrowed some thousands from the uncle, and bought his beautiful  nephew a seat in parliament.    Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was ambitious, and desirous of retrieving his  character. He fagged like a dragon--conned pamphlets and reviews--got  Ricardo by heart--and made notes on the English constitution.    He rose to speak.    \"What a handsome fellow!\" whispered one member.    \"Ah, a coxcomb!\" said another.    \"Never do for a speaker!\" said a third, very audibly.    And the gentlemen on the opposite benches sneered and _heard!_--Impudence  is only indigenous in Milesia, and an orator is not made in a day.  Discouraged by his reception, Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy grew a little  embarrassed.    \"Told you so!\" said one of his neighbours.    \"Fairly broke down!\" said another.    \"Too fond of his hair to have any thing in his head,\" said a third, who  was considered a wit.    \"Hear, hear!\" cried the gentlemen on the opposite benches,    Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy sat down--he had not shone; but, in justice, he  had not failed. Many a first-rate speaker had began worse; and many a  country member had been declared a phoenix of promise upon half his  merit.    Not so, thought the heroes of corn-laws.    \"Your Adonises never make orators!\" said a crack speaker with a wry  nose.    \"Nor men of business either,\" added the chairman of a committee, with a  face like a kangaroo's.    \"Poor devil!\" said the civilest of the set. \"He's a deuced deal too  handsome for a speaker! By Jove, he is going to speak again--this will  never do; we must cough him down!\"    And Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was accordingly coughed down.    Our hero was now seven or eight and twenty, handsomer than ever, and the  adoration of the young ladies at Almack's.    \"We have nothing to leave you,\" said the parents, who had long spent  their fortune, and now lived on the credit of having once enjoyed  it.--\"You are the handsomest man in London; you must marry an heiress.\"    \"I will,\" said Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy.    Miss Helen Convolvulus was a charming young lady, with a hare-lip and  six thousand a-year. To Miss Helen Convolvulus then our hero paid his  addresses.    Heavens! what an uproar her relations made about the matter. \"Easy to  see his intentions,\" said one: \"a handsome fortune-hunter, who wants to  make the best of his person!\"--\"handsome is that handsome does,\" says  another; \"he was turned out of the army, and murdered his  colonel;\"--\"never marry a beauty,\" said a third;--\"he can admire none  but himself;\"--\"will have so many mistresses,\" said a fourth;--\"make you  perpetually jealous,\" said a fifth;--\"spend your fortune,\" said a  sixth;--\"and break your heart,\" said a seventh.    Miss Helen Convolvulus was prudent and wary. She saw a great deal of  justice in what was said; and was sufficiently contented with liberty  and six thousand a-year, not to be highly impatient for a husband; but  our heroine had no aversion to a lover; especially to so handsome a  lover as Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy. Accordingly she neither accepted nor  discarded him; but kept him on hope, and suffered him to get into debt  with his tailor, and his coach-maker. On the strength of becoming Mr.  Fitzroy Convolvulus. Time went on, and excuses and delays were easily  found; however, our hero was sanguine, and so were his parents. A  breakfast at Chiswick, and a putrid fever carried off the latter, within  one week of each other; but not till they had blessed Mr. Ferdinand  Fitzroy, and rejoiced that they had left him so well provided for.    Now, then, our hero depended solely upon the crabbed old uncle and Miss  Helen Convolvulus; the former, though a baronet and a satirist was a  banker and a man of business:--he looked very distastefully at the  Hyperian curls and white teeth of Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy.    \"If I make you my heir,\" said he--\"I expect you will continue the bank.\"    \"Certainly, sir!\" said the nephew.    \"Humph!\" grunted the uncle, \"a pretty fellow for a banker!\"    Debtors grew pressing to Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy, and Mr. Ferdinand  Fitzroy grew pressing to Miss Helen Convolvulus. \"It is a dangerous  thing,\" said she, timidly, \"to marry a man so admired,--will you always  be faithful?\"    \"By heaven!\" cried the lover.    \"Heigho!\" sighed Miss Helen Convolvulus, and Lord Rufus Pumilion  entering, the conversation was changed.    But the day of the marriage was fixed; and Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy bought  a new curricle. By Apollo, how handsome he looked in it! A month before  the wedding day the uncle died. Miss Helen Convolvulus was quite tender  in her condolences--\"Cheer up, my Ferdinand,\" said she, \"for your sake,  I have discarded Lord Rufus Pumilion!\" \"Adorable condescension!\" cried  our hero;--\"but Lord Rufus Pumilion is only four feet two, and has hair  like a peony.\"    \"All men are not so handsome as Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy!\" was the reply.    Away goes our hero, to be present at the opening of his uncle's will.    \"I leave,\" said the testator (who I have before said was a bit of a  satirist,) \"my share of the bank, and the whole or my fortune, legacies  excepted, to\"--(here Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy wiped his beautiful eyes with  a cambric handkerchief, exquisitely _brode_) \"my natural son, John  Spriggs, an industrious, pains-taking youth, who will do credit to the  bank. I did once intend to have made my nephew Ferdinand my heir; but so  curling a head can have no talent for accounts. I want my successor to  be a man of business, not beauty; and Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy is a great  deal too handsome for a banker; his good looks will, no doubt, win him  any heiress in town. Meanwhile, I leave him, to buy a dressing-case, a  thousand pounds.\"    \"A thousand devils!\" said Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy, banging out of the  room. He flew to his mistress. She was not at home. \"Lies,\" says the  Italian proverb, \"have short legs;\" but truths, if they are unpleasant,  have terrible long ones! The next day Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy received a  most obliging note of dismissal.    \"I wish you every happiness,\" said Miss Helen Convolvulus, in  conclusion--\"but my friends are right; you are much too handsome for a  husband!\"    And the week after, Miss Helen Convolvulus became Lady Rufus Pumilion.    \"Alas! sir,\" said the bailiff, as a day or two after the dissolution of  parliament, he was jogging along with Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy, in a  hackney coach bound to the King's Bench,--\"Alas! sir, what a pity it is  to take so handsome a gentleman to prison!\"    The MS. found in a Madhouse, by the same author, is perhaps too horrific  for this terror-loving age; but it is by no means less clever on that  account; _toute en huile_ would not do. Among the other tales are the  Rock of the Candle, Irish, by the author of Holland-Tide,--nearly forty  pages; and the Queen of May and Bridget Plantagenet,--of the olden  time--which would be spoiled by abridgment for our present purpose. The  same reason prevents our giving more than our commendation of Miss  Mitford's General and his Lady, who, we think are new company for our  fair authoress.    In the Vision of Purgatory, by Dr. Maginn, (Irish, of course,) the  serious and ludicrous are mixed up with an abundance of skill and  humour; this piece should be read after the Madhouse sketch.    The Souvenir is opportunely dedicated to Mr. Peel; and whether as a work  of art, or elegant literature, it is decidedly worthy of such  distinguished notice. If the argument of the fine arts contributing to  virtue hold good, then the patronage of a minister will be patriotically  bestowed on such works as the Literary Souvenir.           *       *       *       *       *          The Amulet.    _Edited by S.

Volume 10, No. 284, (#4)"],[1," the river Wye, between the city of Hereford and the town  of Ross, which was known for more than two centuries by the appellation of  \"The Spectre's Voyage;\" and across which, as long as it retained that  appellation, neither entreaty nor remuneration would induce any boatman to  convey passengers after a certain hour of the night. The superstitious  notions current among the lower orders were, that at about the hour of  eight on every evening, a female was seen in a small vessel sailing from  Hereford to Northbrigg, a little village then distant about three miles  from the city, of which not even the site is now discernible; that the  vessel sailed with the utmost rapidity in a dead calm and even against the  wind; that to encounter it was fatal; that the voyager landed from it on  the eastern bank of the river, a little beyond the village; that she  remained some time on shore, making the most fearful lamentations; that she  then re-entered the vessel, and sailed back in the same manner, and that  both boat and passenger vanished in a sudden manner as they arrived at a  certain part of the river, where the current is remarkably strong, within  about half a mile of the city of Hereford,    This singular tradition, like most stories of a similar character, was not  without a foundation in truth, as the reader will perceive who takes the  trouble to peruse the following narrative.    In the turbulent reign of Edward the Second, when the whole of England was  one theatre of lawless violence, when might was constantly triumphant over  right, and princes and soldiers only respected the very intelligible, if  not very equitable principle,        \"That they should take who have the power,    And they should keep who can,\"      the city of Hereford was distinguished by the zeal and patriotism of its  citizens, and by the unshrinking firmness with which they adhered to the  cause of queen Isabella, and the young prince her son, afterwards the  renowned king Edward the Third, in opposition to the weak and ill-fated  monarch who then wore the crown, and his detested favourites the Spensers,  father and son. Sir Hugh Spenser, the younger, was a man of unquestionable  talents, and possessed virtues which, during a period of less violence and  personal animosity, might have proved honourable to himself, and useful to  his country.    The discontents of the queen and the barons were not vented in fruitless  complaints or idle menaces. They flew to arms. The king of France, the  queen's brother, assisted them with men and money; the Count of Hainault,  to whose daughter Philippa, the young prince had been contracted, did the  same. The king was driven from London, and forced, with the elder Spenser,  whom he had created Earl of Winchester, to take refuge in Bristol. Being  hotly pursued to this city by the Earl of Kent and the Count of Hainault,  at the head of a formidable army, he was obliged to flee into Wales,  leaving the elder Spenser governor of the castle of Bristol. This fortress  was immediately besieged, and speedily taken, as the garrison mutinied  against their governor, and delivered him into the hands of his enemies.  This venerable noble, who had nearly reached his ninetieth year, was  instantly, without trial, or witness, or accusation, or answer, condemned  to death by the rebellious barons; he was hanged on a gibbet; his body was  cut to pieces and thrown to the dogs; and his head was sent to Winchester,  the place whence he derived his title, and was there set on a pole, and  exposed to the insults of the populace.    When the news of this catastrophe reached the younger Spenser, he was at  the head of a fine army, which had sat down before the city of Hereford,  for the purpose of reducing it to obedience to king Edward. The formidable  force which he commanded had struck terror into the hearts of the citizens,  so that notwithstanding their attachment to queen Isabella, and their  detestation of Spenser, they had shown symptoms of their willingness to  yield to the latter upon reasonable terms; and he, desirous of obtaining  possession of the city without any unnecessary effusion of blood, had  granted a truce of a week's duration, to give them time to decide upon what  conditions they would open their gates to him. The disastrous intelligence  which he received from Bristol, however, made him doubtful whether he  should hold inviolate the truce which he had granted to the besieged. He  did not doubt but that the Earl of Kent and his troops, flushed with  conquest, would hasten to his destruction, and to the relief of Hereford,  and that unless he could possess himself of the city and castle, and by  shutting himself up in the latter be enabled to bid defiance to his  enemies, the fate of his father must inevitably be his own.    The favourite recreation of the inhabitants of Hereford was then, as it is  now, to make excursions either alone, or in parties, upon their beautiful  river. This amusement had become so much a custom with them, that the most  timid females were not afraid to venture alone and at night in a small  skiff, with which almost every family of respectability was provided; and  on a bright moonlight night, the bosom of the river was beautifully  diversified by the white sails glittering in the moonbeams, while sweet  female voices would be heard warbling some popular melodies, the, subjects  of which were usually the praises of prince Edward, or execrations of  Spenser and those who had corrupted the king. It was on such a night, that  the incident with which our narrative commences occurred. The moon was  riding in an unclouded sky--unclouded except by those light fleecy vapours  which hovered round the form of the queen of night, increasing rather than  diminishing her beauty. The river seemed one sheet of silver, and numerous  little vessels passing and repassing, gave it a delightfully animated  appearance. In one, which seemed to be venturing nearer to the camp of the  enemy than the others, might be seen a light and delicate female form, and  on the shore which she was approaching, a little above the village of  Northbrigg, stood a soldier, whose accoutrements bespoke him to belong to  the army of Sir Hugh Spenser.    The lady landed, and the soldier hastened to meet her. \"Dearest Isabel,\"  he said, \"blessings upon thy generous trusting heart, for this sweet  meeting! I have much to tell thee, but that my tongue dares not utter all  with which my mind is stored; and if it dared, it is not on such a night  as this, so bright, so beautiful, that tidings dark as mine should be  communicated.\" Isabel, who had laid her head upon his breast when they  met, started from him, and gazed with the utmost terror and surprise at  the unwonted gloom which darkened his countenance.    \"Walter, what means this? Come you to break the trusting heart which beats  for you alone? Come you to cancel your vows--to say that we must part for  ever? Oh! better had you left me to the mercy of the wave, when its work  of death was half achieved, if you reserved me only for the misery which  waits upon a broken heart, and blighted and betrayed affections?\"    \"Sweet, dry these tears!\" replied the soldier; \"while I have life I am  thine. I come to warn thee of sure but unseen danger. The walls of  Hereford are strong, and the arms and hearts of her citizens firm and  trusty; but her hour is come, and the path of the destroyer, although  secret, is like the stream which hides itself for a time beneath the earth  only to spring forth more strongly and irresistibly than ever.\"    \"Thy words are dark and dreadful; but I do not know of any cause for fear,  or of any means of avoiding it, if it exists.\"    \"Fly with me, fly!--with thy heart and hand reward my love, and think no  more of those grim walls, and sullen citizens, with souls as iron as their  beavers, and hearts as cold as the waters of their river.\"    \"Oh! no, no, no! my father's head is grey, and but for me alone all his  affections, all his hopes are buried in my mother's grave. He hates thee  and thy cause. When I told him a stranger had rescued his daughter from  the wave, he raised his hands to heaven and blessed him. I told him that  that stranger was a follower of the Spensers'; he checked his unfinished  benediction, and cursed him. But if he knew thee, Walter, thy noble heart,  thy constant love, methinks that time and entreaty would make him listen  to his daughter's prayer.\"    \"Alas! my Isabel, entreaty would be vain, and time is already flapping his  wings, loaded with inevitable ruin, over yon devoted city and its  inhabitants. Thy father shall be safe--trust that to me; and trust me, too,  that what I promise I can perform. But thou, my loved one, thou must not  look upon the horrid face of war: and though my power extends to save thy  father from injury, it would be easier to save the wall-flowers on the  ramparts of the city from the foot of the invader, than one so fair, so  feeble, from his violence and lust.\"    \"Whoe'er thou art,\" she said, \"there is a spell upon my heart which love  and gratitude have twined, and which makes it thine for ever: but sooner  would I lock my hand with that of the savage Spenser himself, when reeking  with the best blood of Hereford's citizens, than leave my father's side  when his gray hairs are in danger, and my native city, when treachery is  in her streets and outrage is approaching her walls.\"    These words were uttered with an animation and vehemence so unusual to  her, that Walter stood for a moment transfixed with wonder; and before he  recovered his self-possession, Isabel, with the velocity of lightning, had  regained her skiff, and was sailing before the wind to Hereford. \"Curse on  my amorous folly!\" he exclaimed, \"that, for a pair of pale cheeks and  sparkling eyes, has perhaps ruined a better concerted stratagem than ever  entered the brain of the Grecian Sinon.
