At first no one could be kinder to the child than she was, but in the  course of time she had a child of her own and then she began to be  jealous of the elder child; and she thought daily how she could get  rid of him. He was still devoted to his cat and one day when he came  back to the house, he asked his stepmother where the cat was. She  answered angrily, \"The cat has bewitched the boy! It is 'cat, cat,'  all day long.\" At this the child began to cry; so she found the cat  and threw it to him, saying, \"Here is your cat: you are mad about  your cat.\" But the boy hugged it in his arms and kept on crying at his  stepmother's cross words. As he would not keep quiet his stepmother got  more angry still; and catching hold of the cat she scratched her own  arms and legs with the cat's claws until the blood flowed; then she  began to cry and scold and when the neighbours came to see what was  the matter, she told them that the boy had let his cat scratch her;  and the neighbours saw that she was not loving the boy as she promised.    Presently the Raja came in and asked what was the matter; she turned  and scolded him saying: \"You have reared the accursed cat and it has  scratched me finely; look, it has taken all the skin off; this is the  way the boy repays me for all my trouble. I will not stay with you; if  I stay the boy will injure me like this again.\" The Raja said, \"Don't  cry like a baby; how can a simple child like that know better? when  he grows up I will scold him.\" But the woman persisted and declared  that she would go away with her own child unless the Raja promised  to kill his elder son. The Raja refused to do this, so the Rani took  up her baby and went out of the house with it in a rage. Now the Raja  was deeply in love with her and he followed and stopped her, and said  that he could not let her take away his younger child; she answered,  \"Why trouble about the child? it is mine; I have left you your boy,  if you don't kill him, when he grows up, he will tell you some lie  about me and make you have me beaten to death.\" At last the Raja  said \"Well, come back and if the boy does you any harm I will kill  him.\" But the Rani said. \"Either kill him now or let me go.\" So at  last the Raja promised and brought her back to the palace. Then the  Raja called the boy and gave him his dinner and told him that they  were going on a visit to his uncle's: and the child was delighted  and fetched his shoes and umbrella, and off they set, and a dog came  running after them. When they came to a jungle the Raja told his son  to sit under a tree and wait for him, and he went away and killed the  dog that had followed them and smeared the blood on his axe and went  home, leaving the child.    When his father did not return, the child began to cry, and Thakur  heard him and came down, and to frighten the boy and make him leave  the jungle he came in the guise of a leopard; but the child would not  move from where he was; then Thakur appeared as a bear, and as a snake  and an elephant and in many other forms but the child would not move;  so at last Thakur took the form of an old woman, who lifted him in  her arms and soothed him and carried him to the edge of the jungle  and left him on the outskirts of a village.    In the morning a rich Brahman found him and took him home, and as no  one claimed the child he brought him up and made him his goat-herd,  and they gave him the name of Lela. The Brahman's sons and daughters  used to go school, and before he took his goats out to graze Lela  used to carry their books to the school. And going to the school every  day Lela got to know one or two letters and used to draw them in the  sand while minding his goats; later he got the children to give him  an old book saying that he wanted to pretend to the other boys that  he could read and out of this book he taught himself to read: and as  he grew up he became quite a scholar. One day he picked up a letter  and found that it was from one of the village girls arranging to elope  that very evening with a young man. At the appointed time Lela went to  the rendez-vous and hid himself in a tree; soon he saw the Brahman's  daughter come to the place, but as her letter had not been delivered  her lover did not appear. The girl got tired of waiting and then she  began to call to her lover, thinking that perhaps he was hiding for  a joke. When she called, Lela answered from the tree and she thought  that it was her lover and said \"Come down and let us be off.\" So  Lela came down and they started off together; when day dawned she saw  that it was Lela who was with her and she sat down and upbraided him  for deceiving her. Lela said that they had met by chance; he had not  enticed her away, no harm had been done and she could go home if she  liked or come away with him if she liked. The girl considered but she  saw that if she went home now she would be disgraced and her family  would be outcasted, so in the end she agreed to run away with Lela.    They went on and after travelling some days they came to a great  city, where they took up their quarters in a tumble-down house and  the next morning Lela went into the city to look for work. He went to  the cutcherry and enrolled himself as a _muktear_ (attorney) and soon  the litigants and the magistrates found out how clever he was and he  acquired a big practice. One day the Raja said, \"This fellow is very  handsome, I wonder what his wife is like?\" And he sent an old woman  to see; so the old woman went and got into conversation with Lela's  wife and returned to the Raja and told him that none of his wives was  so beautiful as Lela's wife; so the Raja determined to go and see  her himself, and as the old woman said that she would hide herself  in the house if she saw the Raja coming, he disguised himself as a  poor man and went and saw her; he found that the old woman had not  exaggerated and he determined to possess himself of Lela's wife. He  had first to get Lela out of the way, so he sent for him and said,  \"You are a fine fellow and have given me satisfaction. I have one  more commission for you, if you perform it I will give you half my  kingdom and my sister in marriage.\" Lela said that he must hear what  it was before he made any promise. The Raja said \"It is this: in a  certain mountain grows the Chandmoni Kusum flower; bring it to me  and I will give you what I have promised:\"--but the Raja felt sure  that if Lela went to the mountain he would be eaten by the Rakhas  (ogress) who dwelt there. Lela said that he would go if the Raja  gave him a written bond In the presence of witnesses; and this the  Raja willingly did. Then Lela went and told his wife and she said,  \"This is excellent: I have a younger sister in the mountain, her name  is Chandmoni and it was she who planted the Chandmoni Kusum flower;  when you get there call her by her name and she will certainly give  you the flower.\"    So Lela started off and when he was gone his wife fell ill, and  her body became a mass of sores. Directly Lela was out of the way,  the Raja sent the old woman to see what his wife was doing and she  brought back word that she was afflicted with illness; so the Raja  sent medicines and told the old woman to nurse her. Lela went off and  came to the cave in the mountain where Chandmoni lived with the Rakhas;  and the Rakhas was away hunting men, so Lela called out Chandmoni and  told her who he was and begged her to hide him; then they planned how  they should kill the Rakhas, and she hid him in the cave; presently  the Rakhas returned and said to Chandmoni \"I smell a man: where is  he?\" But Chandmoni said that there was no one there but herself;  and that the smell was probably due to the Rakhas having been eating  human flesh and recommended her to anoint herself with hot ghee. The  Rakhas agreed: so Chandmoni put a great iron pan of ghee on to boil,  and when it was boiling she called the Rakhas, and as the Rakhas was  leaning over the pan, Lela ran out and pushed her into the boiling  ghee and she died. Then Chandmoni asked Lela why he had come, and  he told her, \"to fetch the flower.\" She promised to give it to him  but asked what was to become of her now that the ogress with whom she  lived was dead. Lela promised to take her with him, so they cut off the  tongue and ears and claws of the Rakhas and returned to the city. And  directly Lela returned, his first wife recovered from her illness.    Then the Raja saw that it was useless to contend with Lela, and he  gave him half his kingdom and married him to his sister according  to his bond. So Lela lived with his three Ranis and they bore him  children and after some years he told them that he was the son of a  Raja and he wished to visit his own country and see whether his father  was alive. So they set out in great style with horses and elephants  and came to the town where Lela's father lived. Now five or six days  after abandoning Lela, his father had become blind and, he made over  the management of his kingdom to a Dewan, and the Dewan and the Rani  managed everything. When the Dewan heard that Lela had come with a  great force he thought that he would loot the country and he ran away  in fear. Then Lela sent word to his father to come to him, as he was  the son who had been abandoned in the jungle, so the Raja set forth  joyfully and after he had gone a few paces he began to see dimly,  and by the time that he came to Lela's camp he had quite recovered  his eyesight. When they met, father and son embraced and wept over  each other; and Lela ordered a feast to be prepared and while this  was being done a maidservant came running to say that the wicked  Rani had hanged herself, so they went and burned the body and then  returned and enjoyed the feast. Then the Raja resigned his kingdom  to Lela and the ryots begged him to stay and rule over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"own pleasure, their fortunes or their fancies.  The Ibero-Aquitanians  numbered twenty tribes; the Gauls twenty-two nations; the original  Kymrians, mingled with the Gauls between the Loire and the Garonne,  seventeen; and the Kymro-Belgians twenty-three.  These sixty-two nations  were subdivided into several hundreds of tribes; and these petty  agglomerations were distributed amongst rival confederations or leagues,  which disputed one with another the supremacy over such and such a  portion of territory.  Three grand leagues existed amongst the Gauls;  that of the Arvernians, formed of peoplets established in the country  which received from them the name of Auvergne; that of the AEduans, in  Burgundy, whose centre was Bibracte (Autun); and that of the Sequanians,  in Franche-Comte, whose centre was Vesontio (Besancon).  Amongst the  Kymrians of the West, the Armoric league bound together the tribes of  Brittany and lower Normandy.  From these alliances, intended to group  together scattered forces, sprang fresh passions or interests, which  became so many fresh causes of discord and hostility.  And, in these  divers-agglomerations, government was everywhere almost equally irregular  and powerless to maintain order or found an enduring state.  Kymrians,  Gauls, or Iberians were nearly equally ignorant, improvident, slaves to  the shiftings of their ideas and the sway of their passions, fond of war  and idleness and rapine and feasting, of gross and savage pleasures.  All  gloried in hanging from the breast-gear of their horses, or nailing to  the doors of their houses, the heads of their enemies.  All sacrificed  human victims to their gods; all tied their prisoners to trees, and  burned or flogged them to death; all took pleasure in wearing upon their  heads or round their arms, and depicting upon their naked bodies,  fantastic ornaments, which gave them a wild appearance.  An unbridled  passion for wine and strong liquors was general amongst them: the traders  of Italy, and especially of Marseilles, brought supplies into every part  of Gaul; from interval to interval there were magazines established,  whither the Gauls flocked to sell for a flask of wine their furs, their  grain, their cattle, their slaves.  \"It was easy,\" says an ancient  historian, \"to get the Ganymede for the liquor.\"  Such are the essential  characteristics of barbaric life, as they have been and as they still are  at several points of our globe, amongst people of the same grade in the  scale of civilization.  They existed in nearly an equal degree amongst  the different races of ancient Gaul, whose resemblance was rendered much  stronger thereby than their diversity in other respects by some of their  customs, traditions, or ideas.    In their case, too, there is no sign of those permanent demarcations,  those rooted antipathies, and that impossibility of unity which are  observable amongst peoples whose original moral condition is really very  different.  In Asia, Africa, and America, the English, the Dutch, the  Spanish, and the French have been and are still in frequent contact with  the natives of the country--Hindoos, Malays, Negroes, and Indians; and,  in spite of this contact, the races have remained widely separated one  from another.  In ancient Gaul not only did Gauls, Kymrians, and Iberians  live frequently in alliance and almost intimacy, but they actually  commingled and cohabited without scruple on the same territory.  And so  we find in the midst of the Iberians, towards the mouth of the Garonne, a  Gallic tribe, the Viviscan Biturigians, come from the neighborhood of  Bourges, where the bulk of the nation was settled: they had been driven  thither by one of the first invasions of the Kymrians, and peaceably  taken root there; Burdigaia, afterwards Bordeaux, was the chief  settlement of this tribe, and even then a trading-place between the  Mediterranean and the ocean.  A little farther on, towards the south, a  Kymrian tribe, the Bolans, lived isolated from its race, in the  waste-lands of the Iberians, extracting the resin from the pines which  grew in that territory.  To the south-west, in the country situated  between the Garonne, the eastern Pyrenees, the Cevennes, and the Rhone,  two great tribes of Kymro-Belgians, the Bolg, Volg, Volk, or Voles,  Arecomican and Tectosagian, came to settle, towards the end of the fourth  century B.  C., in the midst of the Iberian and Gallic peoplets; and  there is nothing to show that the new comers lived worse with their  neighbors than the latter had previously lived together.    It is evident that amongst all these peoplets, whatever may have been  their diversity of origin, there was sufficient similitude of social  condition and manners to make agreement a matter neither very difficult  nor very long to accomplish.    On the other hand, and as a natural consequence, it was precarious and  often of short duration: Iberian, Gallic, or Kymrian as they might be,  these peoplets underwent frequent displacements, forced or voluntary, to  escape from the attacks of a more powerful neighbor; to find new  pasturage; in consequence of internal dissension; or, perhaps, for the  mere pleasure of warfare and running risks, and to be delivered from the  tediousness of a monotonous life.  From the earliest times to the first  century before the Christian era, Gaul appears a prey to this incessant  and disorderly movement of the population; they change settlement and  neighborhood; disappear from one point and reappear at another; cross one  another; avoid one another; absorb and are absorbed.  And the movement  was not confined within Gaul; the Gauls of every race went, sometimes in  very numerous hordes, to seek far away plunder and a settlement.  Spain,  Italy, Germany, Greece, Asia Minor, and Africa have been in turn the  theatre of those Gallic expeditions which entailed long wars, grand  displacements of peoples, and sometimes the formation of new nations.  Let us make a slight acquaintance with this outer history of the Gauls;  for it is well worth while to follow them a space upon their distant  wanderings.  We will then return to the soil of France, and concern  ourselves only with what has passed within her boundaries.          CHAPTER II.  THE GAULS OUT OF GAUL.    About three centuries B.C. numerous hordes of Gauls crossed the Alps and  penetrated to the centre of Etruria, which is nowadays Tuscany.  The  Etruscans, being then at war with Rome, proposed to take them, armed and  equipped as they had come, into their own pay.  \"If you want our hands,\"  answered the Gauls, \"against your enemies, the Romans, here they are at  your service--but on one condition: give us lands.\"    [Illustration: A Tribe of Gauls on an Expedition----27]    A century afterwards other Gallic hordes, descending in like manner upon  Italy, had commenced building houses and tilling fields along the  Adriatic, on the territory where afterwards was Aquileia.  The Roman  Senate decreed that their settlement should be opposed, and that they  should be summoned to give up their implements and even their arms.  Not  being in a position to resist, the Gauls sent representatives to Rome.  They, being introduced into the Senate, said, \"The multitude of people in  Gaul, the want of lands, and necessity forced us to cross the Alps to  seek a home.  We saw plains uncultivated and uninhabited.  We settled  there without doing any one harm.  .  .  .  We ask nothing but lands.  We  will live peacefully on them under the laws of the republic.\"    Again, a century later, or thereabouts, some Gallic Kymrians, mingled  with Teutons or Germans, said also to the Roman Senate, \"Give us a little  land as pay, and do what you please with our hands and weapons.\"    Want of room and means of subsistence have, in fact, been the principal  causes which have at all times thrust barbarous people, and especially  the Gauls, out of their fatherland.  An immense extent of country is  required for indolent hordes who live chiefly upon the produce of the  chase and of their flocks; and when there is no longer enough of forest  or pasturage for the families that become too numerous, there is a swarm  from the hive, and a search for livelihood elsewhere.  The Gauls  emigrated in every direction.  To find, as they said, rivers and lands,  they marched from north to south, and from east to west.  They crossed at  one time the Rhine, at another the Alps, at another the Pyrenees.  More  than fifteen centuries B.C. they had already thrown themselves into  Spain, after many fights, no doubt, with the Iberians established between  the Pyrenees and the Garonne.  They penetrated north-westwards to the  northern point of the Peninsula, into the province which received from  them and still bears the name of Galicia; south-eastwards to the southern  point, between the river Anas (nowadays Guadiana) and the ocean, where  they founded a Little Celtica; and centrewards and southwards from  Castile to Andalusia, where the amalgamation of two races brought about  the creation of a new people, that found a place in history as  Celtiberians.  And twelve centuries after those events, about 220 B.C.,  we find the Gallic peoplet, which had planted itself in the south of  Portugal, energetically defending its independence against the  neighboring Carthaginian colonies.  Indortius, their chief, conquered and  taken prisoner, was beaten with rods and hung upon the cross, in the  sight of his army, after having had his eyes put out by command of  Hamilcar-Barca, the Carthaginian general; but a Gallic slave took care to  avenge him by assassinating, some years after, at a hunting-party,  Hasdrubal, son-in-law of Hamilcar, who had succeeded to the command.  The  slave was put to the torture; but, indomitable in his hatred, he died  insulting the Africans.    A little after the Gallic invasion of Spain, and by reason perhaps of  that very movement, in the first"]]]
