This practical  demonstration, however, has been questioned on the insufficient ground  that \"the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is too small and the  temperature produced by solar radiation too low\" to furnish a safe basis  for computations of solar temperature.    In order to meet the objection that the diffusion of the rays in aphelion  do not differ sufficiently, the solar pyrometer has been so arranged that  the density, _i. e._, the diffusion of the reflected rays, can be changed  from a ratio of 1 in 5,040 to that of 1 in 10,241. This has been effected  by employing heaters respectively 10 inches and 20 inches in diameter.  With reference to the \"low\" solar temperature pointed out, it will be  perceived that the adopted expedient of increasing the density of the rays  without raising the temperature by _converging_ radiation, removes the  objection urged.    Agreeably to the dimensions already specified, the area of the 10-inch  heater acted upon by the reflected solar rays is 331.65 square inches, the  area of the 20-inch heater being 673.9 square inches. The section of the  annular sunbeam whose direct rays act upon the polygonal reflector is  3,130 square inches, as before stated.    Regarding the diffusion of the solar rays during the investigation, the  following demonstration will be readily understood. The area of a sphere  whose radius is equal to the earth's distance from the sun in aphelion  being to the sun's area as 218.1 squared to 1, while the reflecter of the solar  pyrometer intercepts a sunbeam of 3,130 square inches section, it follows  that the reflector will receive the radiant heat developed by 3,130 /  218.1 squared = 0.0658 square inch of the solar surface. Hence, as the 10-inch  heater presents an area of 331.65 square inches, we establish the fact  that the reflected solar rays, acting on the same, are _diffused_ in the  ratio of 331.65 to 0.0658, or 331.65 / 0.0658 = 5,040 to 1; the diffusion  of the rays acting on the 20-inch heater being as 673.9 to 0.0658, or  673.9 / 0.0658 = 10,241 to 1.    The atmospheric conditions having proved unfavorable during the  investigation, maximum solar temperature was not recorded. Accordingly,  the heaters of the solar pyrometer did not reach maximum temperature, the  highest indication by the thermometer of the small heater being 336.5 deg.,  that of the large one being 200.5 deg. above the surrounding air. No  compensation will, however, be introduced on account of deficient solar  heat, the intention being to base the computation of solar temperature  solely on the result of observations conducted at New York during the  summer solstice of 1884. It will be noticed that the temperature of the  large heater is proportionally higher than that of the small heater, a  fact showing that the latter, owing to its higher temperature, loses more  heat by radiation and convection than the former. Besides, the rate of  cooling of heated bodies increases more rapidly than the augmentation of  temperature.    The loss occasioned by the imperfect reflection of the mirrors, as before  stated, is 0.235 of the energy transmitted by the direct solar rays acting  on the polygonal reflector, hence the temperature which the solar rays are  capable of imparting to the large heater will be 200.5 deg. x 1.235 =  247.617 deg.; but the energy of the solar rays acting on the _reflector_ is  reduced 0.207 by atmospheric absorption, consequently the ultimate  temperature which the sun's radiant energy is capable of imparting to the  heater is 1.207 x 247.617 deg. = 298.87 deg. F. It is hardly necessary to observe  that this temperature (developed by solar radiation diffused fully  ten-thousandfold) must be regarded as an _actual_ temperature, since a  perfectly transparent atmosphere, and a reflector capable of transmitting  the whole energy of the sun's rays to the heater, would produce the same.    The result of the experimental investigation carried out during the summer  solstice of 1884 may be thus briefly stated. The diffusion of the solar  rays acting on the 20 inch heater being in the ratio of 1 to 10,241, the  temperature of the solar surface cannot be less than 298.87 deg. x 10,241 =  3,060,727 deg. F. This underrated computation must be accepted unless it can  be shown that the temperature produced by radiant heat is not inversely as  the diffusion of the rays. Physicists who question the existence of such  high solar temperature should bear in mind that in consequence of the  great attraction of the solar mass, hydrogen on the sun's surface raised  to a temperature of 4,000 deg. C. will be nearly twice as heavy as hydrogen on  the surface of the earth at ordinary atmospheric temperatures; and that,  owing to the immense depth of the solar atmosphere, its density would be  so enormous at the stated low temperature that the observed rapid  movements within the solar envelope could not possibly take place. It  scarcely needs demonstration to prove that extreme tenuity can alone  account for the extraordinary velocities recorded by observers of solar  phenomena. But _extreme tenuity_ is incompatible with low temperature and  the pressure produced by an atmospheric column probably exceeding 50,000  miles in height subjected to the sun's powerful attraction, diminished  only one-fourth at the stated elevation. These facts warrant the  conclusion that the high temperature established by our investigation is  requisite to prevent undue density of the solar atmosphere.    It is not intended at present to discuss the necessity of tenuity with  reference to the functions of the sun as a radiator; yet it will be proper  to observe that on merely dynamical grounds the enormous density of the  solar envelope which would result from low temperature presents an  unanswerable objection to the assumption of Pouillet, Vicaire,  Sainte-Claire Deville, and other eminent _savants_, that the temperature  of the solar surface does not reach 3,000 deg. C.    J. ERICSSON.           *       *       *       *       *          CHEMICAL NATURE OF STARCH GRAINS.      Dr. Brukner has contributed to the _Proceedings_ of the Vienna Academy of  Sciences a paper on the \"Chemical Nature of the Different Varieties of  Starch,\" especially in reference to the question whether the granulose of  Nageli, the soluble starch of Jessen, the amylodextrin of W. Nageli, and  the amidulin of Nasse are the same or different substances. A single  experiment will serve to show that under certain conditions a soluble  substance maybe obtained from starch grains.    If dried starch grains are rubbed between two glass plates, the grains  will be seen under the microscope to be fissured, and if then wetted and  filtered, the filtrate will be a perfectly clear liquid showing a strong  starch reaction with iodine. Since no solution is obtained from uninjured  grains, even after soaking for weeks in water, Brukner concludes that the  outer layers of the starch grains form a membrane protecting the interior  soluble layers from the action of the water.    The soluble filtrate from starch paste also contains a substance identical  with granulose. Between the two kinds of starch, the granular and that  contained in paste, there is no chemical but only a physical difference,  depending on the condition of aggregation of their micellae.    W. Nageli maintains that granulose, or soluble starch, differs from  amylodextrin in the former being precipitated by tannic acid and acetate  of lead, while the latter is not. Brukner fails to confirm this  difference, obtaining a voluminous precipitate with tannic acid and  acetate of lead in the case of both substances. Another difference  maintained by Nageli, that freshly precipitated starch is insoluble,  amylodextrin soluble in water, is also contested; the author finding that  granulose is soluble to a considerable extent in water, not only  immediately after precipitation, but when it has remained for twenty-four  hours under absolute alcohol. Other differences pointed out by W. Nageli,  Brukner also maintains to be non-existent, and he regards amidulin and  amylodextrin as identical. Brucke gave the name erythrogranulose to a  substance nearly related to granulose, but with a stronger affinity for  iodine, and receiving from it not a blue but a red color. Brukner regards  the red color as resulting from a mixture of erythrodextrin, and the  greater solubility of this substance in water.    If a mixture of filtered potato starch paste and erythrodextrin is dried  in a watch glass covered with a thin pellicle of collodion, and a drop of  iodine solution placed on the latter, it penetrates very slowly through  the pellicle, the dextrin becoming first tinctured with red, and the  granulose afterward with blue. If, on the other hand, no erythrodextrin is  used, the diffusion of the iodine causes at once simply a blue coloring.    With regard to the iodine reaction of starch, Brukner contests Sachsse's  view as to the loss of color of iodide of starch at a high temperature. He  shows that the iodide may resist heat, and that the loss of color depends  on the greater attraction of water for iodine as compared with starch, and  the greater solubility of iodine in water at high temperatures.    The different kinds of starch do not take the same tint with the same  quantity of (solid) iodine. That from the potato _arum_ gives a blue, and  that from wheat and rice a violet tint; while the filtrate from starch  paste, from whatever source, always gives a blue color.           *       *       *       *       *          THE AMALGAMATION OF SILVER ORES.

In a word, the question is a very  complex one. We look at but one side of it in occupying ourselves only  with the coal consumed, and we shall certainly expose those who allowed  themselves to be influenced by the seductive figures of consumption to  bitter disappointment.    To answer such objections Mr. Aime Witz has established a complete  parallel between the two systems, in which he looks at the question from  a theoretical and practical and scientific and financial point of view.  Considered as a transformation apparatus, a steam motor burning good  Cardiff coal in a Galloway boiler with feed water heaters will consume  (with a good condensing engine utilizing an expansion of a sixth) from  1,100 to 1,250 grammes of coal per effective horse hour, which  corresponds to a rough coefficient of utilization of 9.7 per cent. A gas  generator supplying a gas motor burning Swansea anthracite and Noeux  coke, medium quality, will consume 516 grammes of anthracite and 90 of  coke to produce 2,370 liters of gas giving 1,487 heat units per cubic  meter. Of the 3,524 heat units furnished to the motor by the 2,370  liters of gas, the motor will convert 18 per cent. into disposable  mechanical work.    With the boiler, the gross rendering of the whole is 7 per cent. With  the gas generator it reaches 12.7 per cent. From a theoretical point of  view the advantage therefore rests with the gas generator and gas motor.  In order to compare the net cost of the units of work, from an  industrial point of view, it is necessary to form estimates of  installation, costs of keeping in repair, interest and amortization.    Figs. 1 and 2 represent, on the same scale, the installations necessary  in each of these systems. The legends indicate the names of the  different apparatus in each installation. The following table shows  that, as regards the surface occupied, the advantage is again with the  gas generator and gas motor:                         Steam Engine.      Gas Motor.    Surface covered.       85 sq. m.       72 sq. m.    Surface exposed.       33    \"         43    \"                          ---             ---    Total surface.        118    \"        115    \"    The estimates of installation formed by Mr. Witz set forth the expense  relative to the capital engaged exactly at the same figure of 32,000  francs for a motive power of 75 effective horses. The expenses of  keeping in repair, interest, etc., summed up, show that the cost per day  of 10 hours is 47.9 francs for the steam engine and 39.6 for the gas  motor, say a saving of 8.3 francs per day, or about 2,500 francs for a  year of 300 days' work.    The gas motor, therefore, effects a great saving, while at the same time  occupying less space, consuming less water and operating just as well.    With Mr. Witz we cheerfully admit all the advantages that he so clearly  establishes with his perfect competency in such matters, but there still  remain two points upon which we wish to be enlightened. Are not the  starting up, the operation and the keeping in repair of a gas generator  actually more complicated and more delicate than the same elements of a  steam engine? Does not the poor gas manufactured in a gas generator  present, from a hygienic point of view, danger sufficiently great to  proscribe the use of such apparatus in many circumstances?    Such are the points upon which we should like to be enlightened before  unreservedly sharing Mr. Witz's enthusiasm, which, however, is  justified, economically speaking, by the magnificent results of the  experiments made by the learned engineer.--_La Nature_.

We publish illustrations of a Thwaites suspension pneumatic power 1/2 cwt.  hammer of a new design, for planishing pipes and plates, for which we  are indebted to _Engineering_. As indicated in the perspective view  (Fig. 1) the mechanism is supported at the center of a cross girder  resting on two cast iron square pillars, box section, each bolted down  to the foundations by four 11/4 in. diameter bolts. The measurements of  these columns and girders are given in Figs. 2 and 3, the former an  elevation of the hammer and the latter a plan, partly in section, of the  cross girder, while Fig. 4 is a cross section showing the arrangements  for operating the hammer. In the center is a cast iron guide for working  the ram, the guide being extended on two sides to receive the disk crank  journals, 2 in. in diameter by 31/2 in. long. The disk cranks are  connected to a hollow steel ram by a connecting rod. The ram is divided  inside into two compartments, each having a phosphor bronze air piston.  These are connected together by a steel piston rod, the top air piston  forming a connection for the small end of the connecting rod. The  outside diameter of the ram is 33/4 in., and the diameter of the air  pistons 23/4 in. and 2-7/8 in. respectively. Cottered into the bottom of  the ram is a steel pallet holder with a dovetail, so that the pallet can  be renewed or exchanged for one of another shape when required. Keyed on  to the crankshaft is a flanged pulley 10 in. in diameter by 31/4 in.  between flanges. There is also an overhead countershaft with strap  shifting arrangement. At the side of one of the columns a hand lever and  quadrant are provided, as shown in the perspective view and in Fig. 2,  for working an arrangement for tightening the belt when the machine is  working. To this arrangement is connected a powerful brake which stops  the machine in a few revolutions. It will be seen that the brake is  applied as the belt is slackened for stopping the machine. For  planishing pipes or tubes a long wrought iron mandrel is provided  mounted on two cast iron carriages, each having four flanged wheels for  running on rails. The hammer is arranged so that tubes 4 feet in  diameter can be worked for planishing plates. A pallet is fastened on  the top of one of the mandrel carriages, Figs. 5 to 8 showing the  details of the carriages. The general dimensions are: Distance between  pillars, 6 feet; height under girder, 5 feet; height from ground to top  of mandrel, 4 feet 13/4 in.; and length of stroke, 5 in. This machine is  capable of delivering 500 blows per minute. The constructors are Messrs.  Thwaites Brothers, Limited, Bradford, Yorkshire.

BY THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY NON-RESIDENT LECTURERS IN MECHANICAL  ENGINEERING.    COMPRESSED AIR PRODUCTION.    By WM. L. SAUNDERS, C.E., of New York.      I cannot but realize as I stand before you that I would be very much  more at home were I in your midst. I feel but little older and so very  much less wise than when I sat in the class room an undergraduate of the  University of Pennsylvania, that I trust I may expect you to give me  this afternoon, not only your attention, but your sympathy.    The present situation is not without suggestions of my own experience. I  recall a lecture in the ordinary course, given by our professor of  mining, whose struggles with the English language were quite as  conspicuous as were our efforts to tell what he was driving at. He was  describing an ordinary windlass hoist used at the shaft of a mine. He  said \"There is a windlass at de top of de shaft around which is coiled a  rope, on de two ends of which is fastened two er--er--_pans_, one of  which is a _bucket_ and de oder a _platform_.\" I mention this because I  shall ask you to attribute my shortcomings in this lecture, not so much  to my lack of familiarity with my native tongue, as to--well, because I  was not educated at Cornell University.    We all know what free air is. You who are privileged to live upon these  beautiful hills overlooking Ithaca and the lake, doubtless know more  about free air than we do who are choked in the dusty confines of New  York City. Compressed air is simply air under pressure. That pressure  may be an active one, as in the case of the piston of an air compressor;  or passive, as with the walls of a receiver or transmission pipe. It is  usual to define compressed air as air increased in density by pressure,  but we know that we may produce compressed air by heat alone. A simple  illustration of this is the pressure which will blow a cork from an  empty bottle when that bottle has been placed near the fire. Here we  have pressure, or compressed air, in the bottle produced by heat alone.    Having defined compressed air, we must next define heat; for in dealing  with compressed air, we are brought face to face with the complex laws  of Thermodynamics. We cannot produce compressed air without also  producing heat, and we cannot use compressed air as a power without  producing cold. Based on the material theory of heat, we would say that  when we take a certain volume of free air and compress it into a smaller  space, we get an increase in temperature because we have the heat of one  volume occupying less space, but no one at this date accepts the  material theory of heat. Your distinguished director, Professor  Thurston, in discussing \"Steam and its Rivals,\" in the _Forum_, said:  \"The science of Thermodynamics teaches that heat and mechanical energy  are only different phases of the same thing, the one being the motion of  molecules, and the other that of masses.\" This is the accepted theory of  heat. In other words, we do not believe that there is any such _thing_  as heat, but that what we call heat is only the sensible effect of  motion. In the cylinder of an air compressor the energy of the piston is  converted into molecular motion in the air and the result, or the  equivalent, is heat. A higher temperature means an increased speed of  vibration, and a lower"]]]
