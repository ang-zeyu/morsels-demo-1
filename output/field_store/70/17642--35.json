His fears, however, began to be on the wane, as he became more  accustomed to his new employment. Indeed, he went so far as to gaze on  one of the noble knights straight in the face--nay, even at last  ventured to sip out of a bowl of wine that stood near him, which  diffused a most delicious odour around. He found this sip so  invigorating, that he soon took a somewhat longer pull; and in a short  time Peter had quite forgotten that such things as Sittendorf, Wife, or  Goats had ever existed; and on finding himself the least weary, he had  only to apply to the never-failing goblet. At last he fell fast asleep.    On waking, Peter found he was in the same little enclosure where he was  wont to count his flocks. He shook himself well, and rubbed his eyes;  but neither dog nor goats were to be seen; and he was astonished in no  slight degree to observe that he was nearly surrounded with high grass,  and trees, and shrubs, which he never before remarked, growing about  that spot. Lost in perplexity, he followed his way to all the different  haunts he had frequented with his herds, but no traces of them were to  be discovered; at last he hastily bent his steps to Sittendorf, which  lay beneath.    The persons whom he met on his way to the village were all strangers to  him; they were differently dressed, and did not precisely speak the  language of his acquaintance; and on inquiring after his goats, all  stared and touched their chins. At last he mechanically did the same,  but what was his surprise when he found his beard lengthened at least a  foot; on which he began to conclude that he and those around him were  all under the influence of magic or enchantment. Yet the mountain he had  descended was certainly the Kyffhaeusen--the cottages, too, with their  gardens and enclosures, were all quite familiar to him--and he heard  some boys reply to the passing questions of a traveller, that it was  Sittendorf.    His doubt and perplexity now increased every moment, and he quickened  his steps towards his own dwelling; he hardly knew it, it was so much  decayed; and before the door lay a strange goatherd's boy, with a dog  apparently at the last extreme of age, that snarled when he spoke to  him. He entered the house through an opening, which had formerly been  closed by a door. All was waste and void within; he staggered out as if  he had lost his senses, calling on his wife and children by their names;  but no one heard--none answered. Before long, a crowd of women and  children had collected around the strange old man, with the long hoary  beard, and all inquired what it was he was seeking after. This was  almost too much; to be thus questioned before his own door was more than  strange, and he felt ashamed to ask after his wife and children, or even  of himself; but to get rid of his querists he mentioned the first name  that occurred to him, \"Kurt Steffen?\" The people looked around in  silence, till at length an old woman said, \"He has been in the  churchyard these twelve years past, and you'll not go thither to-day.\"--  \"Velten Meier?\"--\"Heaven rest his soul!\" replied an ancient dame,  leaning on a crutch. \"Heaven rest his soul! he has lain in the house he  will never leave these fifteen years!\"    The goatherd shuddered to recognise in the last speaker his next  neighbour, who seemed all at once to have grown old; but he had lost all  desire to inquire further. Suddenly a smart young woman pressed through  the surrounding gapers, with an infant in her arms, and leading a girl  about fourteen years old--all three the exact image of his wife. With  greater surprise than ever he inquired her name. \"Maria!\"--\"And your  father's name?\"--\"Peter Klaus! Heaven rest his soul! It is now twenty  years since his goats returned without him, and we sought for him in  vain day and night in the Kyffhaeusen mountains--I was then hardly seven  years old.\"    Our goatherd could no longer contain himself. \"I am Peter Klaus!\" he  roared, \"I am Peter Klaus, and no one else!\" and he caught the child  from his daughter's arms. Every one, for an instant, stood as if  petrified, till at length one voice, and another, and then another,  exclaimed, \"Yes, this is, indeed, Peter Klaus! welcome, neighbour!  welcome, after twenty years!\"    VYVYAN.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY             *       *       *       *       *      ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.      Since our last visit, many of the tenants have begun to _hybernate_, and  tasteful erections have been made for their winter quarters in all parts  of the gardens. Several others are in progress, and a semi-circular  aviary for British birds is already built. The _season_ is far advanced,  and there have been but few _arrivals_ of late. The _emus'_ grounds have  been enclosed with elegant iron-work, and several removals or _changes_  have taken place. Some of the animals are much affected by the cold  weather. Thus, the monkeys have left their houses on poles, and retired  to enclosed cages, where they nestle in groups of threes and fours, and  amuse themselves by teazing the least of their company; for here, as  elsewhere, the weakest goes to the wall. Three fine wolves, previously  shut up in a small den, now enjoy a large cage, where they appear much  invigorated by the bracing season. Here and there a little animal lies  curled up in the corner of his cage, in a state of torpidity. Among the  birds, the macaws were holding an in-door council in their robes of  state; whilst one fine fellow, in blue coat and yellow waistcoat,  perched himself outside the aviary, and by his cries, proved that fine  colours were not weather-proof. The snowy plumage of the storks was  \"tempered to the wind;\" but they reminded us of their original  abode--the wilderness. The eagles and vultures in the circular aviary  sat on their perches, looking melancholy and disconsolate, but well  protected from cold. The kangaroos have removed into their new house,  and their park has been relaid, although they still look unsettled. A  very pretty beaver-house has been built of mimic rocks.    Among the _introductions_, or new faces, we noticed a pair of fine  mastiffs from Cuba, and two Thibet watch-dogs. One of the latter stood  shivering in the cold, with bleared eyes, and crying \"like a lubberly  postmaster's boy.\" The three bears exhibited as much good-breeding as  the visiters encouraged,--climbing to the top of the pole when there was  any thing to climb after, and an Admiralty expedition could do no more.    _Poisoning of Vegetables_.    Several very curious experiments on the poisoning of vegetables, have  recently been made by M. Marcet, of Geneva.--His experiments on arsenic,  which is well known to every one as a deadly poison to animals, were  thus conducted. A vessel containing two or three bean plants, each of  five or six leaves, was watered with two ounces of water, containing  twelve grains of oxide of arsenic in solution. At the end of from  twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the plants had faded, the leaves  drooped, and had even begun to turn yellow; the roots remained fresh,  and appeared to be living. Attempts to restore the plants after twelve  or eighteen hours, by abundant watering, failed to recover them. The  leaves and stem of the dead plant gave, upon chemical examination,  traces of arsenic. A branch of a rose-tree, including a flower, was  gathered just as the rose began to blow; the stem was put into a vessel,  containing a solution of six grains of oxide of arsenic in an ounce of  water. The flower and leaves soon showed symptoms of disease, and on the  fifth day the whole branch was withered and dead, though only one-fifth  of a grain of arsenic had been absorbed. Similar stems, placed in pure  water, had, after five days, the roses fully expanded, and the leaves  fresh and green.    On June 1st, a slit of one inch and a half in length was made in the  stem of a lilac tree, the branch being about an inch in diameter. The  slit extended to the pith. Fifteen or twenty grains of moistened arsenic  were introduced, the cut was closed, and the stem retained in its  original position by osier ties. On the 8th, the leaves began to roll up  at the extremity; on the 28th, the branches were dry, and, in the second  week of July, the whole of the stem was dry, and the tree itself dead.  In about fifteen days after the first, a tree, which joined the former a  little above the earth, shared the same fate, in consequence of its  connexion with that into which the poison had been introduced. Other  trees similarly cut, but without having been poisoned, suffered no kind  of injury.    M. Marcet's experiments upon vegetable poisons are no less interesting,  and still more wonderful, as indicating a degree of irritability in  plants somewhat similar to that which depends on the nervous system in  animals. After having ascertained that the bean plants could exist in a  healthy state for five or six days, if immersed in the same quantity of  spring water, he tried them with five or six grains of opium dissolved  in an ounce of water, the consequence of which was, that in the evening  the leaves had dropped, and, by the middle of next day, they were dead  beyond recovery. Other vegetable poisons of the narcotic class produced  a similar effect. Hemlock was equally fatal, and six grains of dry  powdered foxglove, in an ounce of water, began to operate, by wrinkling  some of the leaves of the bean in a few moments, which it completely  killed in twenty-four hours. Oxalic acid or salt of sorrel, though found  in common and wood sorrel, and a great many plants, proved a very fatal  poison to others.

Another  time he requested permission to take three Belgian women  through the lines to their family in Bruges. The German  commandant said \"No.\" \"All right,\" said Van Hee, taking out a  package of letters from captured German officers who were now in  the hands of the Belgians, and dangling the packet before the  commandant, \"If I don't get that permit, you don't get these letters.\"  He got the permit.    After a few such clashes the invaders learned that when it came to  this Schrecklichkeit business they had no monopoly on the article.  Van Hee's name was not to be trifled with. But on the other hand  there must necessarily have existed a certain resentment against  him for his ruthless and effective diplomacy. It would no doubt  afford Javert a pleasant sensation to take it out on any one  appearing in any way as a protege of Van Hee.    \"Yes, it's Van Hee's signature all right,\" muttered Javert with a  shrug of his shoulders, \"only he is not the consul, but the vice-  consul at Ghent and let us remember that he is of Belgian  ancestry--that wouldn't incline him to deep friendship with us.\"    On a card of introduction from Ambassador Van Dyke there were  the words \"Writer for The Outlook.\" It's hard to understand how  that escaped my very scrutinous search, but there it was.    \"Another anti-German magazine,\" commented, sardonically. I was  marveling at the uncanny display of knowledge of this man at the  center of the European maelstrom, aware of the editorial policy of  an American magazine.    \"But that doesn't mean that I am anti-German,\" I protested; \"we  can retain our own private opinions.\"    \"Tommyrot,\" exclaimed Javert, \"tommy-rot!\" Strange language in a  military court! Where had he laid hold of that choice bit of our  vernacular?    \"You know perchance,\" he continued, \"what the penalty is for  newspaper men caught on the German side.\" I thought that surely  I was going to reap the result of the adverse reports that the  American correspondents had made already about the Germans,  when he added, \"But you are here on a different charge.\"    The judge started to cross-examine me as to all my antecedents.  My replies were in German--or purported to be--but in my  eagerness to clear myself I must have wrought awful havoc with  that classic language. I was forthwith ordered to talk English and  direct my remarks to Javert, acting now as interpreter. In the midst  of this procedure Javert, with a quick sudden stroke, produced the  scribble-paper which he had seized in the morning, held it fairly in  my face, and cried, \"Whose writing is that?\" The others all riveted  their gaze upon me.    I replied calmly, \"It is mine.\"    \"I want you to put it into full, complete writing,\" cried Javert. \"As it  now stands it is a telegraphic code.\"    That is the most complimentary remark that has ever been made  upon my hieroglyphics. However, I shall be eternally grateful to  Providence for my Horace Greeley style. For, while that document  contained by no means any military secrets, there were, on the  other hand, uncomplimentary observations about the Germans. It  would not be good strategy to let these fall into their hands in their  present mood. At Javert's behest, I set to work on my paper, and  delivered to him in ten minutes a free, full, rapid translation of the  abbreviated contents. On inspecting it Javert said, irritably, \"I want  an exact, precise transcript of everything here.\"    \"I thought you wanted it in a hurry,\" I rejoined.    \"No hurry at all. We have ample time to fix your case.\"    These words do not sound a bit threatening, but it was the general  setting in which they were said that made them so ominous, and  which set the cold waves rippling up and down my spinal column.    I set to work again, numbering every phrase in my scribble-paper,  and then in the same number on the other paper giving a full,  readable translation of it. I wrote out the things complimentary to  the Germans in the fullest manner. But how was I going to take the  sting out of the adverse comments?    Phrase No. 1 meant \"Musical nature of the German automobile  horns.\" Their silver and flute-like notes had been a pleasing sound,  rolling along the roads. That was good.    Phrase No. 2 meant \"The moderation of the Germans in not  billeting more troops upon the hotels.\" I wondered why they had  not commandeered quarters in more of the big empty hotels  instead of compelling men to sleep in railway stations and in the  open air. That was good.    Phrase No. 3 meant \"German officers never refused to contribute  to the Belgian Relief Funds.\" These boxes were constantly shaken  before them in every cafe, and not once was a box passed to an  officer in vain. For all this I was very grateful and everything went  on very merrily until I came to phrase Number 4.    \"If Bel I wld join posse Ger myself\"; which, being interpreted,  reads, \"If I were a Belgian, I would join a posse against the  Germans myself.\" That looked ugly, but I wanted to record for  myself the ugly mood of resentment I had felt when I saw Belgians  compelled to submit to certain humiliations and indignities from  their invading conquerors.    German or non-German--it makes no difference; any one who had  seen those swaggering officers riding it rough-shod over those  poor peasants would have felt the same tide of indignation  mounting up in him. In that mood it would have given me genuine  pleasure to have joined a little killing-party and wiped out those  officers. Now these self-same officers were gathered round me  trying to decide whether they were to have a little killing-party on  their own account.    There was sufficient justification for inciting their wrath in that one  sentence as it stood, and they were all combining to entrap me by  every possible means. Furthermore, they were hankering for a  victim. I had only my wits to match against their desires. I cudgeled  my brains as I never did before, but to no avail. Almost panic-  stricken I was ready to give up in despair and throw myself upon  the mercy of the court when, like a flash of inspiration, the right  reading came. I transcribed that ugly phrase now to read: \"If I were  among the Belgians, I would join possibly the Germans myself.\"  What more could the most ardent German patriot ask for? That  met every abbreviation and made a beautifully exact reversal of  the intended meaning. Not as an example in ethics, but as a  \"safety first\" exhibit I must confess to a real pride in that piece of  work. I handed it over with the cherubic expression of the prize-  scholar in the Sunday School.    Javert had figured on finding incriminating data in it. It was to be  his chief evidence. He read it over with increasing disappointment  and gave it the minutest analysis, comparing it closely with the  original scribble-paper. For example, he called the attention of the  judge to the fact that \"guarded\" in one paper was spelled  \"gaurded\" in the other--some slip I had inadvertently made. He  thought it might now be made a clew to some secret code, but,  though he puzzled long and searchingly over the document, he  extracted from it nothing more than an increased vexation of spirit.    \"Nothing on the surface here,\" Javert said to the judge; \"but that  only makes it look the more suspicious. Wait till we hear from the  search of his room.\"    At this juncture a man in civilian dress arrived, and, handing over  the key of Room Number 502, reported that there was nothing to  bring back. This nettled Javert, and he made and X-ray examination  of my person, even tearing out the lining of my hat. Alas for him too late;  his search disclosed nothing more damnatory than a French  dictionary, which, because I was not an ostrich, I had been unable  to get away with in the afternoon. A few addresses had been  scribbled therein. He demanded a full account of each name.  Some I had really forgotten.    \"That's strange,\" he sneered; \"perhaps you don't find it convenient  to remember who they are.\"    Up till now I hadn't the slightest conception of the charge laid  against me. Suddenly the judge crashed into the affair and took  the initiative.    \"Why did you offer money to find out the movement of German  troops!\" he let go at me across the table in a loud voice.    At the same time his aides converged on me a full, searching  gaze. Going all day without food, for eight hours confined in a fetid  atmosphere, and for two hours grilled by a dozen inquisitors, is an  ordeal calculated to put the nerves of the strongest on edge.    I simply replied, \"I didn't do any such thing.\"    \"Don't lie!\" \"Tell the whole truth!\" \"Make a clean breast of it!\" \"No  use holding anything back!\" \"We have the witnesses who will  swear you did!\" \"Best thing for you is to tell all you know!\"    This fusillade of command and accusation they roared and  bellowed at me, aiming to break down my defense with the  suddenness of the onslaught. They succeeded for a moment. I  couldn't rally my scattered and worn-out wits to think what the  basis of this preposterous charge might be.    Then I remembered a Dutchman who had accosted me the day  before on a street-car. He had volunteered the information that he  was taking people by automobile out through Liege into Holland,  giving one thus the opportunity to see a great many troops and  ruins along the way. I told him I had some money and would be  glad to invest in such a trip, at the same time giving him my  address at the Hotel Metropole. Guileless as he appeared, he  turned out to be an agent of the German Government. He naturally  wanted to make himself solid with his masters by delivering the goods,  so he had twisted all my words into the most damning evidence,  and had fixed up two or three witnesses ready to swear anything.    \"No use wasting time or effort to save this man,\" "]]]
