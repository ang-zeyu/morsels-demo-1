The coffin, of lead,  measured 9 feet 2 inches in the clear, and the wooden case 4 inches  more. It was 3 feet across the shoulders. No hearse could be procured  sufficiently long to contain it; on which account, that end of the  coffin which could not be shut in, was covered with black cloth.  Fourteen men bore him from the hearse to the grave, into which he was  let down with pulleys. To prevent any attempt to disturb his remains, of  which Cotter had, when living, the greatest horror, the grave was made  12 feet in a solid rock.    FROM A CORRESPONDENT.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.           *       *       *       *       *      STEAM CARRIAGES ON COMMON ROADS.      [One of the most accredited works upon this vital topic is _An  Historical and Practical Treatise upon Elemental Locomotion;_ by Mr.  Alexander Gordon, Civil Engineer. It shows the commercial, political,  and moral advantages; the means by which an elemental power is obtained;  the rise, progress, and description of steam-carriages; the roads upon  which they may be made to travel; and the ways and means for their  general introduction. This arrangement of the subject is exceedingly  well executed by Mr. Gordon, who has added a series of efficient  illustrations--from a diagram simplifying the high-pressure modification  of the steam-engine as applied to steam-carriages, to the last completed  Steam Drag and Carriage attached; while the most material points of Mr.  Gordon's views are fortified by a condensation of the evidence before  the select committee of the House of Commons. All this and much more is  accomplished within two hundred octavo pages, which a less economical  and therefore less praiseworthy editor would have expanded into a costly  quarto. Mr. Gordon's work has thus been planned and executed in the  right spirit: he maintains national benefits which must arise from the  adoption of steam carriages, and he seeks to place his views in the  hands of all who are immediately interested in the subject by means as  efficient as economical. We quote a few extracts, (the most interesting  to the general reader,) from the first chapter, which aims at a cursory  estimate of a few of the leading commercial, political, and moral  advantages which will accrue to the community by the substitution of  inanimate or steam power for animate or horse power, for locomotive  purposes; leaving its spirit of fairness to the just appreciation of  the reader.]      _Economy of Conveyance_.    In a great commercial country like ours, extending its ramifications to  every branch of natural and artificial produce, it is almost superfluous  to remark that a vast capital is sunk annually in the mere transport of  marketable commodities: and which is not only a loss to the seller as  being an unproductive outlay, but entails a heavy increase of expense  to the buyer also upon every article of daily consumption. Any means,  therefore, that will accelerate the conveyance, and at the same time  reduce materially the expense of carriage, bears upon its surface a  great public gain.    Expeditious locomotion, to the commercial world more particularly, in  every mercantile transaction, is equivalent to capital: and such is the  vast importance of economy of time here, that no extra expense is  considered as too great to accomplish the utmost speed. We have this  practically illustrated in the preference which society gives to a  complicated machinery put into motion at an enormous expense, to  travelling by the winds of heaven which cost nothing.    To the merchant time gained is equal to money: for time occupied in  travelling is just so much profitable employment lost. Time occupied  in the transport of goods is equivalent to so much interest of capital  spent: for a thousand pounds invested in merchandise is unproductive so  many days as the transport is tedious. That part of the capital of an  individual which is employed in the carrying of his goods to and from  market, is so much abstracted from his means of producing more of the  article in which he exerts his ingenuity and labour, whether it be in  agriculture or manufacture.    Easy communication lessens the time occupied in the transport; and a  saving of time lessens the distance, or our notion of distance. This  effects a saving of money: and a saving of money permits of a greater  employment of capital. The man who can only afford to keep one traveller  soliciting orders for his goods, will thus be enabled to keep two;  because the expense of travelling will be reduced a half. Or it may be,  he will find it more advantageous to employ the saving in the production  of a more delicate and desirable article in the way of his trade. The  increased traffic from place to place will give likewise an impulse to  business, which, in the present stagnant times, is most desirable. The  manufacturer in Scotland will find the London market more easily arrived  at: and the merchant in the metropolis will be able to get his orders  more rapidly given and executed. A conveyance which, in good management,  would be a weekly one, is, in bad management, a monthly one: and the  carrier is obliged to quadruple his charge for the transport. To meet  this charge the merchant has to add to the cost of the article, and so  on throughout the various gradations of mercantile transition, until the  consumer pays the necessarily increased price. Hence, whatever reduces  the price of transportation, reduces the price of the commodity  transported. Whatever reduces the traveller's time, reduces his claim  for compensation, and (competition being always at work) he is content  with a smaller profit upon his merchandise. If a scarcity of any article  occurs at one point of the kingdom, the monopolist there cannot continue  his increased price for any duration of time. Commerce may, in this  respect, be resembled to water, for, if not obstructed, it will always  circulate till it finds its level. An opening or channel being  furnished, an equalised supply will make its way wherever required.    Thus we see that the strength, wealth, and happiness of a nation, depend  very much upon facility of communication. The ill-defended spot in the  empire is alive to the reality, that subsidies having bad roads or a  tedious navigation to pass may arrive too late to present an effectual  resistance to a plundering enemy. The hard-working emigrant of a remote  settlement, distant from a market, feels the difficulty and loss he  sustains in bringing produce to the spot where merchants and dealers  meet for the purposes of exchange. A spot uncommunicated with may be  visited by the honors of famine, and no channel exist for conveying  thither the food required. A grievous pestilence may sweep off an  isolated people before the aid of the physician can arrive to arrest  its progress.    Such facts are obvious to even the most indifferent observers of human  society. Yet, nevertheless, there have been, and are, short-sighted  individuals, in every gradation of it, with minds and views so warped  and distorted by an ignorant selfishness, that they have opposed  every improvement which tended to make the least change in their  long-established habits. Such persons were they, who, during the last  century, promoted petitions from counties in the neighbourhood of  London, praying Parliament not to extend the turnpike-roads into remoter  parts of the country, lest these remote districts, by means of a less  expensive labour, should be able to sell their agricultural products  in the London markets at a cheaper rate than themselves!--and such in  our own day are the attempts made to put down steam conveyance. How  short-sighted we are! Did we consult our own advantage we should see  that those facilities of communication, against which we oppose  ourselves, are the growing sinews of a greater fabric of wealth and  prosperity.    Such are the numerous and important advantages, in a commercial point of  view, which will result to society from the substitution of elementary  for physical power. But even these, great though they be, are of  trifling consideration when compared with the immense benefits which  will result from the substitution when brought into operation as an  economic principle.      _Substitution of Steam for Horse Power_.    [Mr. Gordon then refers to the conclusion of political economists \"that  the grand source of all our evils is _redundancy_ of population; or in  other words, an increase of animated life _beyond_ the nourishment  adequate to support it.\"]    The substitution of inanimate for animate power, if not the panacea which  is to cure all the evils of our condition, is at least one that comes  recommended as a matter of fact--easy of operation, and effectual in its  result. If want of food, or, in other words, redundancy of population  be the bane of the country, it does not propose to meet that evil by a  visionary project, tending in its operation to unhinge society--tedious in  its process, and ending at length in bitter disappointment--but it meets  the evil directly, substantially, and effectually, by the substitution of  food.    And how are all these immense advantages to be effected?--By the  substitution of inanimate for animate power. At present, the animate  power employed in the commercial transportations of this great kingdom is  estimated to amount to two millions of horses: each horse consumes as much  food as is necessary for the support of eight men. Hence the conversion of  its consumption to purposes of human existence would, if carried to this  practical extent, amount to a quantity of food equal to support sixteen  millions of people.    Where the product is so enormous--so vastly beyond our immediate  necessities--it is not requisite to go into any minutiae of detail.

They  left home and stayed together. The Ku Klux very seldom interfered with a  woman or a child.    \"They often scared colored people by drinking large quantities of water.  They had something that held a lot of water, and when they would raise  the bucket to their mouths to drink, they would slip the water into it.      White Caps    \"The white caps operated further to the northwest of where I lived. I  never came in contact with them. They were not the same thing as the Ku  Klux.      Voting    \"In South Carolina under the Reconstruction, we voted right along. In  1868 there were soldiers at all of the election places to see that you  did vote.      Career Since the War    \"In 1881 I married. The year after that, in '83,[HW: ?] I merchandised a  little. Then I got converted. I got it in my head that it was wrong to  take big profits from business, so I sold out. Then I was asked to  assist the keeper of the jail.    \"In 1888 I went to school for the first time. I was then twenty-six  years old. By the end of the first term, I knew all that the teacher  could teach, so he sent me to Claflin University. I left there in the  third year normal.    \"When I returned home, I taught school, at first in a private school and  later in a public school for $15 a month.    \"A man named Boyle told me that he had some ground to sell. I saved up  $45, the price he asked for it. When I offered it to him, he said that  he had decided not to sell it. I went to town and spent my $45. A few  days later, he met me and offered me the place again. I told him I had  spent my money. He then offered it to me on time. There was plenty of  timber on the place, so I got some contracts with a man named Roland and  delivered wood to him. When I went to collect the money, he said he  would not pay me in money.    \"A man named Pennington offered me 20¢ a day for labor. I asked if he  would pay in money.    \"He replied, 'If you're looking for money, don't come.'    \"I went home and said to my wife, 'I am going to leave here.'    \"I came to Forrest City, Arkansas January 28, 1888. I farmed in Forrest  City, making one crop, and then I entered the ministry, and then I  preached at Spring Park for two years.    \"Then I entered Philander Smith College where I stayed from 1891-1897. I  preached from the time I left Philander until 1913.    \"Then I studied law and completed the American Correspondence course in  Law when I was fifty years old. I am still practicing.      Wife and Family    \"In 1897, when I graduated from Philander, my wife and six children were  sitting on the front seat.    \"I have eleven sons and daughters, of whom six are living. I had seven  brothers and sisters.    \"My wife and I have been married fifty-six years. I had to steal her  away from her parents, and she has never regretted coming to me nor I  taking her.\"      Interviewer's Comment    \"Brother Mack\" as he is familiarly and affectionately known to his  friends is a man keen and vigorous, mentally and physically. He attends  Sunday school, church both in the morning and evening, and all  departments of the Epworth League. He takes the Epworth Herald, the  Southwestern Christian Advocate, the Literary Digest, some poultry and  farm magazines, the Arkansas Gazette, and the St. Louis Democrat, and  several other journals. He is on omnivorous reader and a clear thinker.  He raises chickens and goats and plants a garden as avocations. He has  on invincible reputation for honesty as well as for thrift and thought.    Nothing is pleasanter than to view the relationship between him and his  wife. They have been married fifty-six years and seem to have achieved a  perfect understanding. She is an excellent cook and is devoted to her  home. She attends church regularly. Seems to be four or five years  younger than her husband. Like him, however, she seems to enjoy  excellent health.          Interviewer: Mrs. Bernice Bowden  Person interviewed: Cresa Mack                      1417 Short Indiana St., Pine Bluff, Ark.  Age: 85      \"I can tell you something about slavery days. I was born at South Bend,  Arkansas on the old Joe Clay place. I 'member they used to work 'em  scandalous. They used me at the house and I used to wait on old  mistress' brother. He was a old man named Cal Fletcher.    \"I 'member when they said the Yankees was comin' the boss man put us in  wagons and runned us to Texas. They put the women and chillun in the  wagons but the men had to walk. I know I was something over twelve years  old.    \"Old mistress, Miss Sarah Clay, took her chillun and went to Memphis.    \"My white folks treated us very well. I never seed 'em whip my mother  but once, but I seen some whipped till they's speechless. Yes ma'm I  have.    \"I can 'member a lot 'bout the war. The Lord have mercy, I'se old. I  'member they used to sing      'Run nigger run,    The paddyrollers'll ketch you,    Run nigger run.'    \"Corse if they ketch you out without a pass they'd beat you nearly to  death and tell you to go home to your master.    \"One time I was totin' water for the woman what did the washin'. I was  goin' along the road and seed somethin' up in a tree that look like a  dog. I said 'Look at that dog.' The overseer was comin' from the house  and said 'That ain't no dog, that's a panther. You better not stop' and  he shot it out. Then I've seen bears out in the cane brakes. I thought  they was big black bulls. I was young then--yes mam, I was young.    \"When the Yankees come through they sot the house afire and the gin and  burned up 'bout a hundred bales a cotton. They never bothered the  niggers' quarters. That was the time the overseer carried us to Texas to  get rid of the Yankees.    \"After the surrender the Yankees told the overseer to bring us all up in  the front yard so he could read us the ceremony and he said we was as  free as any white man that walked the ground. I didn't know what 'twas  about much cause I was too busy playin'.    \"I didn't know what school was 'fore freedom, but I went about a month  after peace was declared. Then papa died and mama took me out and put me  in the field.    \"I was grown, 'bout twenty-four or five, when I married. Now my chillun  and grand chillun takes care of me.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Warren McKinney, Hazen, Arkansas  Age: 85      I was born in Edgefield County, South Carolina. I am eighty-five years  old. I was born a slave of George Strauter. I remembers hearing them say  \"Thank God Ize free as a jay bird.\" My ma was a slave in the field. I  was eleven years old when freedom was declared. When I was little, Mr.  Strauter whipped my ma. It hurt me bad as it did her. I hated him. She  was crying. I chunked him with rocks. He run after me, but he didn't  catch me. There was twenty-five or thirty hands that worked in the  field. They raised wheat, corn, oats, barley, and cotton. All the  children that couldn't work stayed at one house. Aunt Mat kept the  babies and small children that couldn't go to the field. He had a gin  and a shop. The shop was at the fork of the roads. When de war come on  my papa went to build forts. He quit ma and took another woman. When de  war closed ma took her four children, bundled em up and went to Augusta.  The government give out rations there. My ma washed and ironed. People  died in piles. I don't know till yet what was de matter. They said it  was the change of living. I seen five or six wooden, painted coffins  piled up on wagons pass by our house. Loads passed every day lack you  see cotton pass here. Some said it was cholorea and some took  consumption. Lots of de colored people nearly starved. Not much to get  to do and not much house room. Several families had to live in one  house. Lots of the colored folks went up north and froze to death. They  couldn't stand the cold. They wrote back about them dieing. No they  never sent them back. I heard some sent for money to come back. I heerd  plenty bout the Ku Klux. They scared the folks to death. People left  Augusta in droves. About a thousand would all meet and walk going to  hunt work and new homes. Some of them died. I had a sister and brother  lost that way. I had another sister come to Louisiana that way. She  wrote back.    I don't think the colored folks looked for a share of land. They never  got nothing cause the white folks didn't have nothing but barren hills  left. About all the mules was wore out hauling provisions in the army.  Some folks say they ought to done more for de colored folks when dey  left, but dey say dey was broke. Freeing all de slaves left em broke.    That reconstruction was a mighty hard pull. Me and ma couldn't live. A  man paid our ways to Carlisle, Arkansas and we come. We started working  for Mr. Emenson. He had a big store, teams, and land. We liked it fine,  and I been here fifty-six years now. There was so much wild game living  was not so hard. If a fellow could get a little bread and a place to  stay he was all right. After I come to dis state I voted some. I have  farmed and worked at odd jobs. I farmed mostly. Ma went back to her old  master. He persuaded her to come back home. Me and her went back and run  a farm four or five years before she died. Then I come back here. I  first had 300 acres at Carlisle. I sold it and bought 80 acres at Green  Grove. I married in South Carolina. We had a fine weddin, home weddin.  Each of our families furnished the weddin supper. We had 24 waiters.  That is all the wife I ever had. We lived together 57 years. It is hard  for me to keep up with my mind since she died. She been dead five years  nearly now. I used to sing but I forgot all the songs. We had song  books. I joined the church when I was twelve years old.    I think the times are worse than they use to be. The people is living  mighty fast I tell you. I don't get no help from the government. They  won't give me the pension. I can't work and I can't pay taxes on my  place. "]]]
