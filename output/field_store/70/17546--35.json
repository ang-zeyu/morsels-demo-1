When these wrappings were removed, the fish was found thoroughly cooked  and both Trot and Cap'n Bill ate of it freely. It had a slight flavor  of seaweed and would have been better with a sprinkling of salt.    The soft glow which until now had lighted the cavern, began to grow  dim, but there was a great quantity of seaweed in the place, so after  they had eaten their fish they kept the fire alive for a time by giving  it a handful of fuel now and then.    From an inner pocket the sailor drew a small flask of battered metal  and unscrewing the cap handed it to Trot.  She took but one swallow of  the water although she wanted more, and she noticed that Cap'n Bill  merely wet his lips with it.    \"S'pose,\" said she, staring at the glowing seaweed fire and speaking  slowly, \"that we can catch all the fish we need; how 'bout the  drinking-water, Cap'n?\"    He moved uneasily but did not reply. Both of them were thinking about  the dark hole, but while Trot had little fear of it the old man could  not overcome his dislike to enter the place. He knew that Trot was  right, though. To remain in the cavern, where they now were, could only  result in slow but sure death.    It was nighttime up on the earth's surface, so the little girl became  drowsy and soon fell asleep. After a time the old sailor slumbered on  the sands beside her. It was very still and nothing disturbed them for  hours. When at last they awoke the cavern was light again.    They had divided one of the biscuits and were munching it for breakfast  when they were startled by a sudden splash in the pool. Looking toward  it they saw emerging from the water the most curious creature either of  them had ever beheld. It wasn't a fish, Trot decided, nor was it a  beast. It had wings, though, and queer wings they were: shaped like an  inverted chopping-bowl and covered with tough skin instead of feathers.  It had four legs--much like the legs of a stork, only double the  number--and its head was shaped a good deal like that of a poll parrot,  with a beak that curved downward in front and upward at the edges, and  was half bill and half mouth. But to call it a bird was out of the  question, because it had no feathers whatever except a crest of wavy  plumes of a scarlet color on the very top of its head. The strange  creature must have weighed as much as Cap'n Bill, and as it floundered  and struggled to get out of the water to the sandy beach it was so big  and unusual that both Trot and her companion stared at it in wonder--in  wonder that was not unmixed with fear.          Chapter Three    The Ork      The eyes that regarded them, as the creature stood dripping before  them, were bright and mild in expression, and the queer addition to  their party made no attempt to attack them and seemed quite as  surprised by the meeting as they were.    \"I wonder,\" whispered Trot, \"what it is.\"    \"Who, me?\" exclaimed the creature in a shrill, high-pitched voice.  \"Why, I'm an Ork.\"    \"Oh!\" said the girl. \"But what is an Ork?\"    \"I am,\" he repeated, a little proudly, as he shook the water from his  funny wings; \"and if ever an Ork was glad to be out of the water and on  dry land again, you can be mighty sure that I'm that especial,  individual Ork!\"    \"Have you been in the water long?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, thinking it  only polite to show an interest in the strange creature.    \"Why, this last ducking was about ten minutes, I believe, and that's  about nine minutes and sixty seconds too long for comfort,\" was the  reply. \"But last night I was in an awful pickle, I assure you. The  whirlpool caught me, and--\"    \"Oh, were you in the whirlpool, too?\" asked Trot eagerly.    He gave her a glance that was somewhat reproachful.    \"I believe I was mentioning the fact, young lady, when your desire to  talk interrupted me,\" said the Ork. \"I am not usually careless in my  actions, but that whirlpool was so busy yesterday that I thought I'd  see what mischief it was up to. So I flew a little too near it and the  suction of the air drew me down into the depths of the ocean. Water and  I are natural enemies, and it would have conquered me this time had not  a bevy of pretty mermaids come to my assistance and dragged me away  from the whirling water and far up into a cavern, where they deserted  me.\"    \"Why, that's about the same thing that happened to us,\" cried Trot.  \"Was your cavern like this one?\"    \"I haven't examined this one yet,\" answered the Ork; \"but if they  happen to be alike I shudder at our fate, for the other one was a  prison, with no outlet except by means of the water.  I stayed there  all night, however, and this morning I plunged into the pool, as far  down as I could go, and then swam as hard and as far as I could. The  rocks scraped my back, now and then, and I barely escaped the clutches  of an ugly sea-monster; but by and by I came to the surface to catch my  breath, and found myself here. That's the whole story, and as I see you  have something to eat I entreat you to give me a share of it. The truth  is, I'm half starved.\"    With these words the Ork squatted down beside them. Very reluctantly  Cap'n Bill drew another biscuit from his pocket and held it out. The  Ork promptly seized it in one of its front claws and began to nibble  the biscuit in much the same manner a parrot might have done.    \"We haven't much grub,\" said the sailor-man, \"but we're willin' to  share it with a comrade in distress.\"    \"That's right,\" returned the Ork, cocking its head sidewise in a  cheerful manner, and then for a few minutes there was silence while  they all ate of the biscuits. After a while Trot said:    \"I've never seen or heard of an Ork before. Are there many of you?\"    \"We are rather few and exclusive, I believe,\" was the reply. \"In the  country where I was born we are the absolute rulers of all living  things, from ants to elephants.\"    \"What country is that?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"Orkland.\"    \"Where does it lie?\"    \"I don't know, exactly. You see, I have a restless nature, for some  reason, while all the rest of my race are quiet and contented Orks and  seldom stray far from home. From childhood days I loved to fly long  distances away, although father often warned me that I would get into  trouble by so doing.    \"'It's a big world, Flipper, my son,' he would say, 'and I've heard  that in parts of it live queer two-legged creatures called Men, who war  upon all other living things and would have little respect for even an  Ork.'    \"This naturally aroused my curiosity and after I had completed my  education and left school I decided to fly out into the world and try  to get a glimpse of the creatures called Men. So I left home without  saying good-bye, an act I shall always regret. Adventures were many, I  found. I sighted men several times, but have never before been so close  to them as now. Also I had to fight my way through the air, for I met  gigantic birds, with fluffy feathers all over them, which attacked me  fiercely. Besides, it kept me busy escaping from floating airships. In  my rambling I had lost all track of distance or direction, so that when  I wanted to go home I had no idea where my country was located. I've  now been trying to find it for several months and it was during one of  my flights over the ocean that I met the whirlpool and became its  victim.\"    Trot and Cap'n Bill listened to this recital with much interest, and  from the friendly tone and harmless appearance of the Ork they judged  he was not likely to prove so disagreeable a companion as at first they  had feared he might be.    The Ork sat upon its haunches much as a cat does, but used the  finger-like claws of its front legs almost as cleverly as if they were  hands. Perhaps the most curious thing about the creature was its tail,  or what ought to have been its tail. This queer arrangement of skin,  bones and muscle was shaped like the propellers used on boats and  airships, having fan-like surfaces and being pivoted to its body. Cap'n  Bill knew something of mechanics, and observing the propeller-like tail  of the Ork he said:    \"I s'pose you're a pretty swift flyer?\"    \"Yes, indeed; the Orks are admitted to be Kings of the Air.\"    \"Your wings don't seem to amount to much,\" remarked Trot.    \"Well, they are not very big,\" admitted the Ork, waving the four hollow  skins gently to and fro, \"but they serve to support my body in the air  while I speed along by means of my tail. Still, taken altogether, I'm  very handsomely formed, don't you think?\"    Trot did not like to reply, but Cap'n Bill nodded gravely. \"For an  Ork,\" said he, \"you're a wonder. I've never seen one afore, but I can  imagine you're as good as any.\"    That seemed to please the creature and it began walking around the  cavern, making its way easily up the slope. While it was gone, Trot and  Cap'n Bill each took another sip from the water-flask, to wash down  their breakfast.    \"Why, here's a hole--an exit--an outlet!\" exclaimed the Ork from above.    \"We know,\" said Trot. \"We found it last night.\"    \"Well, then, let's be off,\" continued the Ork, after sticking its head  into the black hole and sniffing once or twice. \"The air seems fresh  and sweet, and it can't lead us to any worse place than this.\"    The girl and the sailor-man got up and climbed to the side of the Ork.    \"We'd about decided to explore this hole before you came,\" explained  Cap'n Bill; \"but it's a dangerous place to navigate in the dark, so  wait till I light a candle.\"    \"What is a candle?\" inquired the Ork.    \"You'll see in a minute,\" said Trot.    The old sailor drew one of the candles from his right-side pocket and  the tin matchbox from his left-side pocket. When he lighted the match  the Ork gave a startled jump and eyed the flame suspiciously; but Cap'n  Bill proceeded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#3)"],[1,"l, for the frog grew very  fast and very big, feeding on the magic skosh which is found nowhere  else on earth except in that one pool.  And the skosh not only made the  frog very big so that when he stood on his hind legs he was as tall as  any Yip in the country, but it made him unusually intelligent, so that  he soon knew more than the Yips did and was able to reason and to argue  very well indeed.    No one could expect a frog with these talents to remain in a hidden  pool, so he finally got out of it and mingled with the people of the  tableland, who were amazed at his appearance and greatly impressed by  his learning.  They had never seen a frog before, and the frog had  never seen a Yip before, but as there were plenty of Yips and only one  frog, the frog became the most important.  He did not hop any more, but  stood upright on his hind legs and dressed himself in fine clothes and  sat in chairs and did all the things that people do, so he soon came to  be called the Frogman, and that is the only name he has ever had.  After some years had passed, the people came to regard the Frogman as  their adviser in all matters that puzzled them.  They brought all their  difficulties to him, and when he did not know anything, he pretended to  know it, which seemed to answer just as well.  Indeed, the Yips thought  the Frogman was much wiser than he really was, and he allowed them to  think so, being very proud of his position of authority.    There was another pool on the tableland which was not enchanted but  contained good, clear water and was located close to the dwellings.  Here the people built the Frogman a house of his own, close to the edge  of the pool so that he could take a bath or a swim whenever he wished.  He usually swam in the pool in the early morning before anyone else was  up, and during the day he dressed himself in his beautiful clothes and  sat in his house and received the visits of all the Yips who came to  him to ask his advice.  The Frogman's usual costume consisted of  knee-breeches made of yellow satin plush, with trimmings of gold braid  and jeweled knee-buckles; a white satin vest with silver buttons in  which were set solitaire rubies; a swallow-tailed coat of bright  yellow; green stockings and red leather shoes turned up at the toes and  having diamond buckles.  He wore, when he walked out, a purple silk hat  and carried a gold-headed cane.  Over his eyes he wore great spectacles  with gold rims, not because his eyes were bad, but because the  spectacles made him look wise, and so distinguished and gorgeous was  his appearance that all the Yips were very proud of him.    There was no King or Queen in the Yip Country, so the simple  inhabitants naturally came to look upon the Frogman as their leader as  well as their counselor in all times of emergency.  In his heart the  big frog knew he was no wiser than the Yips, but for a frog to know as  much as a person was quite remarkable, and the Frogman was shrewd  enough to make the people believe he was far more wise than he really  was.  They never suspected he was a humbug, but listened to his words  with great respect and did just what he advised them to do.    Now when Cayke the Cookie Cook raised such an outcry over the theft of  her diamond-studded dishpan, the first thought of the people was to  take her to the Frogman and inform him of the loss, thinking that of  course he would tell her where to find it.  He listened to the story  with his big eyes wide open behind his spectacles, and said in his  deep, croaking voice, \"If the dishpan is stolen, somebody must have  taken it.\"    \"But who?\" asked Cayke anxiously.  \"Who is the thief?\"    \"The one who took the dishpan, of course,\" replied the Frogman, and  hearing this all the Yips nodded their heads gravely and said to one  another, \"It is absolutely true!\"    \"But I want my dishpan!\" cried Cayke.    \"No one can blame you for that wish,\" remarked the Frogman.    \"Then tell me where I may find it,\" she urged.    The look the Frogman gave her was a very wise look, and he rose from  his chair and strutted up and down the room with his hands under his  coattails in a very pompous and imposing manner.  This was the first  time so difficult a matter had been brought to him, and he wanted time  to think.  It would never do to let them suspect his ignorance, and so  he thought very, very hard how best to answer the woman without  betraying himself.  \"I beg to inform you,\" said he, \"that nothing in  the Yip Country has ever been stolen before.\"    \"We know that already,\" answered Cayke the Cookie Cook impatiently.    \"Therefore,\" continued the Frogman, \"this theft becomes a very  important matter.\"    \"Well, where is my dishpan?\" demanded the woman.    \"It is lost, but it must be found.  Unfortunately, we have no policemen  or detectives to unravel the mystery, so we must employ other means to  regain the lost article.  Cayke must first write a Proclamation and  tack it to the door of her house, and the Proclamation must read that  whoever stole the jeweled dishpan must return it at once.\"    \"But suppose no one returns it,\" suggested Cayke.    \"Then,\" said the Frogman, \"that very fact will be proof that no one has  stolen it.\"    Cayke was not satisfied, but the other Yips seemed to approve the plan  highly.  They all advised her to do as the Frogman had told her to, so  she posted the sign on her door and waited patiently for someone to  return the dishpan--which no one ever did.  Again she went, accompanied  by a group of her neighbors, to the Frogman, who by this time had given  the matter considerable thought.  Said he to Cayke, \"I am now convinced  that no Yip has taken your dishpan, and since it is gone from the Yip  Country, I suspect that some stranger came from the world down below us  in the darkness of night when all of us were asleep and took away your  treasure.  There can be no other explanation of its disappearance.  So  if you wish to recover that golden, diamond-studded dishpan, you must  go into the lower world after it.\"    This was indeed a startling proposition.  Cayke and her friends went to  the edge of the flat tableland and looked down the steep hillside to  the plains below.  It was so far to the bottom of the hill that nothing  there could be seen very distinctly, and it seemed to the Yips very  venturesome, if not dangerous, to go so far from home into an unknown  land.  However, Cayke wanted her dishpan very badly, so she turned to  her friends and asked, \"Who will go with me?\"    No one answered the question, but after a period of silence one of the  Yips said, \"We know what is here on the top of this flat hill, and it  seems to us a very pleasant place, but what is down below we do not  know.  The chances are it is not so pleasant, so we had best stay where  we are.\"    \"It may be a far better country than this is,\" suggested the Cookie  Cook.    \"Maybe, maybe,\" responded another Yip, \"but why take chances?  Contentment with one's lot is true wisdom. Perhaps in some other  country there are better cookies than you cook, but as we have always  eaten your cookies and liked them--except when they are burned on the  bottom--we do not long for any better ones.\"    Cayke might have agreed to this argument had she not been so anxious to  find her precious dishpan, but now she exclaimed impatiently, \"You are  cowards, all of you!  If none of you are willing to explore with me the  great world beyond this small hill, I will surely go alone.\"    \"That is a wise resolve,\" declared the Yips, much relieved.  \"It is  your dishpan that is lost, not ours.  And if you are willing to risk  your life and liberty to regain it, no one can deny you the privilege.\"    While they were thus conversing, the Frogman joined them and looked  down at the plain with his big eyes and seemed unusually thoughtful. In  fact, the Frogman was thinking that he'd like to see more of the world.  Here in the Yip Country he had become the most important creature of  them all, and his importance was getting to be a little tame.  It would  be nice to have other people defer to him and ask his advice, and there  seemed no reason so far as he could see why his fame should not spread  throughout all Oz.  He knew nothing of the rest of the world, but it  was reasonable to believe that there were more people beyond the  mountain where he now lived than there were Yips, and if he went among  them he could surprise them with his display of wisdom and make them  bow down to him as the Yips did.  In other words, the Frogman was  ambitious to become still greater than he was, which was impossible if  he always remained upon this mountain.  He wanted others to see his  gorgeous clothes and listen to his solemn sayings, and here was an  excuse for him to get away from the Yip Country.  So he said to Cayke  the Cookie Cook, \"I will go with you, my good woman,\" which greatly  pleased Cayke because she felt the Frogman could be of much assistance  to her in her search.    But now, since the mighty Frogman had decided to undertake the journey,  several of the Yips who were young and daring at once made up their  minds to go along, so the next morning after breakfast the Frogman and  Cayke the Cookie Cook and nine of the Yips started to slide down the  side of the mountain.  The bramble bushes and cactus plants were very  prickly and uncomfortable to the touch, so the Frogman quickly  commanded the Yips to go first and break a path, so that when he  followed them he would not tear his splendid clothes. Cayke, too, was  wearing her best dress and was likewise afraid of the thorns and  prickers, so she kept behind the Frogman.    They made rather slow progress and night overtook them before they were  halfway down the mountainside, so they found a cave in which they  sought shelter until morning.  Cayke had brought along a basket full of  her famous cookies, so they all had plenty to eat.  On the second day  the Yips "]]]
