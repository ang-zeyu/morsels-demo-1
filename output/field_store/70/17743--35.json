Study  and direct aural influence of a perfected soul are the two objective  means of instilling powerful suggestions into the subjective self or the  inner soul. All knowledge is within the deeps of the eternal subjective.  But the gate is locked. Your Guru gives you the master-key with which to  unlock the door and enter the gate of wisdom and power. Once you are  there all pain and death shall be conquered. You can then help yourself.  Man can only worship such a God as is greater than himself in degree and  not in kind. Such a God he can \"grow into.\" It is the impersonal God of  the Hindu Philosophy that gives you the abstract ideas and the living  Guru (God) in human form that gives you the concrete ideal. The one is  necessary for the soaring intellect; the other for the rousing and  enkindling of tremendous and indomitable motive-power. Seek both and when  you find them worship and serve them with all your heart and soul. 'My  worship for my master is the worship of a dog. I do not seek to  understand his nature. It ever startles with its newness and profound  depth'. So spoke Vivekananda of Ram Krishna. Need I tell you of the  tremendous and world-conquering power that awoke in Vivekananda through  mere Guru worship? In India the Guru asks for nothing short of absolute  worship, obedience, and submission to his will although none values and  appreciates individual freedom more than the master. So long as you are  at the feet of your master be as submissive as a lamb. So will you open  yourself to his great batteries of inner power. Serve him. Please him.  Obey him. Be his slave. No matter what contradictions you may see.  A great and profound nature is full of contrary ways and his character  is a paradox impossible for you to read through reason and observation.  You can only understand him by having perfect faith in him, loving  and serving him like a faithful dog. So will you tap on to his inner  forces. And when he sends you away into the broad world to live out the  great ideal he has set before you, you shall be astonished at your  courage and power. You shall take fearless possession of this world  and every minute you shall realise how only he can command who has  learnt to obey. By commanding I do not mean dominating any one and  forcing your views on others. This is the sign of fools. But you will  find your influence radiating and circling out naturally and  irresistibly, winning souls to the higher life, and you yourself shall  thus stand as a tower of strength, a redeemer of the race, an inspiration  and a living benediction unto humanity. Peace be with you! May you  realise strength of soul!          LESSON II.    PERSONAL MAGNETISM, WILL-CULTURE, SELF-CONTROL.      Personal Magnetism is the individual expression of a subtle irresistible  and dynamic _Force_ in man, which enables him to exert an unusual  influence upon others. You all have come into contact with men of this  type. They are endowed with marvelous, almost miraculous powers of  influencing, persuading, attracting, fascinating, ruling and bending to  their own Will-Force men of widely varying mental peculiarities and  temperaments. Men actually go out of their way to please them. They  attract others without any visible effort and others feel drawn to them  in spite of themselves. Various are the examples of such power as  afforded by history.    Now what is this power due to? How to develop it within yourself?  Is it possible for everyone to acquire it? Has it or can it be put to any  higher and nobler use than merely to enslave others' minds in order to  make them subservient to your selfish purposes on the relative plane  of existence? If so, what is that higher use? I know of a Christian  gentleman, Mr. K. by name, who had been smitten with the young  governess of a Magistrate in Benares. This grown-up man sought out  a young College student who was a born leader of men and who was  adored, admired and universally respected by all students, teachers and  professors. \"I wish you would teach me Mesmerism so that I may  _fascinate_ that girl\"--this was the application of Mr. K. Well, the  upshot of it all was that Mr. K. got a severe and stern rebuke from the  young mesmerist, who in all truth was a born Yogi and cared not for the  petty ways and small thoughts and attainments of men of this world. I  find that nearly all modern Western writers on and teachers of this  subject are much, in fact solely, taken up with the idea of  sensationalism through Occultism, so much so that when a really  thoughtful man investigates their writings he feels utterly disgusted,  repelled and horrified at the very name of Occultism. \"_It is sin to  manifest power_,\" said Vivekananda. The man who studies Yoga and  Occultism simply with a view to develop, display and demonstrate Psychic  and Super-normal Powers and _Siddhies_ always ends in _Lust_ and is  caught up in a psychic machinery of law and destructive thought forces  that effectually grind him to pieces. His spiritual progress is thrown  back over ages and he is made to retrace his steps slowly and painfully.  I cannot too strongly condemn the modern tendency to \"impress\" others, to  \"strike terror\" into others, to \"psychologize\" others towards the  accomplishment of our personal motives. If you are one such, do, for  heaven's sake, open your eyes to your gross ignorance and low  propensities or be not surprised if one day you find yourself face to  face with some powerful scoundrel who would not scruple to crush you in  all possible ways. \"Harm watch, harm catch.\" I am going to give you in  practical form what constitute the real cause at the back of a \"Magnetic\"  personality--that which when developed makes a god-like man of any human  weakling.    This power is by no means the especial and peculiar possession of some  divinely gifted individuals. _Everyone can cultivate it_. It is in you  and needs vigorous stirring up as a condition of its awakening. There  are some men who are born great; others are made so by certain unforeseen  circumstances; a third class becomes great through conscious and  intelligent effort.    Now, what are the causes behind Personal Influence?    (1)  Some say that the right control of the Sex-Force or Celibacy  is the cause.    (2)  Others say that vegetarianism leads to it.    (3)  Still others assert that it is physical energy and nerve force.    (4) A fourth class has it that there emanates a current of magnetism  from the human body and influences everyone coming within its  \"Magnetic field\".    Taking the last view point first, I should say, with certain other  leading mental Scientists, that the human dynamic force is different from  \"magnetism\" as the latter bears direct reference to the loadstone.    Again, my own personal observations as well as those of others prove  conclusively that although \"magnetic\" personalities have remarkably  well-disciplined and highly trained physical energies, it is rarely or  never a huge gigantic physique with large, unsightly muscles that exerts  this force. No, it is decidely something other than mere physical energy  and brute strength. A light, active, vigorous physique is desirable and  any one can have it. Again, the principle value of a non-flesh diet lies  in the fact that fruits, nuts, corn and vegetables are possessed of  rhythmic qualities and go to build up a fine, sensitive physique capable  of greater powers of endurance and sustained mental effort than the  'carcass' of any animal ever can. Matter does affect mind in the lower  stages of organic evolution but the process is largely reversed as soon  as CONSCIOUS evolution commences. Therefore vegetarianism, although  highly commendable, from a strictly scientific point of view for the  development of an active and energetic, refined organism, is by no means  a rigid and indispensable necessity in this respect. In fact, some most  \"magnetic\" individuals make 'graveyards of their stomachs' as a Mental  Scientist puts it.    Lastly, Bramhacharya or Celibacy, as practised by Sannyasis in India, has  a strictly spiritual significance although it certainly has much as  everything to do with Personal Magnetism. To the average man I would say:  \"Strive for CONTINENCE, chastity and control in this direction.\" Do not  emasculate, as that would be a waste of force. The stronger this force,  the better. All Sannyasis learn consciously or unconsciously to transmute  this energy into mental and spiritual force and generally their minds  dwell on a plane of mental and spiritual effort where there cannot be  even a breath of sensuality or grossness. They have gone beyond such  things utterly; the same statement applies to all advanced thinkers,  philosophers and workers, whether married or unmarried. To me the very  name of philosophy carries with it an atmosphere of Chastity, Solemnity,  and Divinity.    But although there is some measure of truth in all the above four  statements, they all miss the real thing. The question resolves itself  into this: \"_What makes one man superior to another_?\" The study of  nature shows us that the higher form of intelligence controls the lower.  All leaders of mankind, such as Napoleon, Alexander, etc., were clearly  ahead of the times. But they strove for low things and their SUCCESS  from our point of view is doubtful. Let us take higher ground. Buddha,  Christ, Zoroaster, etc., etc., of ancient times and Vivekananda and a few  others in modern times exhibited tremendous powers of influencing men.  You study their lives and writings and try to find out just those things  that constituted the basic cause of their heroic fibre.    If I were asked to sum up the secrets of their Power I would say:  1. \"_Their Intelligence_ and _Thought-Power._ 2. Awakened _Will-Power_  and _Self-Control_.\"    1.

MAMMALIA.      With the exception of the Mammalia and Birds, the fauna of Ceylon has,  up to the present, failed to receive that systematic attention to  which its richness and variety most amply entitle it. The Singhalese  themselves, habitually indolent, and singularly unobservant of nature  and her operations, are at the same time restrained from the study of  natural history by the tenet of their religion which forbids the  taking of life under any circumstances. From the nature of their  avocations, the majority of the European residents, engaged in  planting and commerce, are discouraged by want of leisure from  cultivating the taste; and it is to be regretted that, with few  exceptions, the civil servants of the government, whose position and  duties would have afforded them influence and extended opportunities  for successful investigation, have never seen the importance of  encouraging such studies.    The first effective impulse to the cultivation of natural science in  Ceylon, was communicated by Dr. Davy when connected with the medical  staff[1] of the army from 1816 to 1820, and his example stimulated  some of the assistant-surgeons of Her Majesty's forces to make collections  in illustration of the productions of the colony. Of these the late  Dr. Kinnis was one of the most energetic and successful. He was  seconded by Dr. Templeton of the Royal Artillery, who engaged  assiduously in the investigation of various orders, and commenced an  interchange of specimens with Mr. Blyth[2], the distinguished  naturalist and curator of the Calcutta Museum. The birds and rarer  vertebrata of the island were thus compared with their peninsular  congeners, and a tolerable knowledge of those belonging to the island,  so far as regards the higher classes of animals, has been the result.  The example so set was perseveringly followed by Mr. E.L. Layard and  the late Dr. Kelaart, and infinite credit is due to Mr. Blyth for the  zealous and untiring energy with which he has devoted his attention  and leisure to the identification of the specimens forwarded from  Ceylon, and to their description in the Calcutta Journal. To him, and  to the gentlemen I have named, we are mainly indebted for whatever  accurate knowledge we now possess of the zoology of the colony.    [Footnote 1: Dr. DAVY, brother to the illustrious Sir Humphry Davy,  published, in 1821, his _Account of the Interior of Ceylon and its  Inhabitants_, which contains the earliest notice of the Natural  History of the island, and especially of its ophidian reptiles.]    [Footnote 2: _Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal_, vol. xv. p. 280, 314.]    The mammalia, birds, and reptiles received their first scientific  description in an able work published in 1852 by Dr. Kelaart of the army  medical staff[1], which is by far the most valuable that has yet  appeared on the Singhalese fauna. Co-operating with him, Mr. Layard has  supplied a fund of information especially in ornithology and conchology.  The zoophytes and Crustacea have I believe been partially investigated  by Professor Harvey, who visited Ceylon in 1852, and more recently by  Professor Schmarda, of the University of Prague. From the united labours  of these gentlemen and others interested in the same pursuits, we may  hope at an early day to obtain such a knowledge of the zoology of Ceylon  as will to some extent compensate for the long indifference of the  government officers.

In Ceylon there are five species, four of which belong to one  group, the Wanderoos, and the other is the little graceful grimacing  _rilawa_[1], which is the universal pet and favourite of both  natives and Europeans. The Tamil conjurors teach it to dance, and in  their wanderings carry it from village to village, clad in a grotesque  dress, to exhibit its lively performances. It does not object to smoke  tobacco. The Wanderoo is too grave and melancholy to be trained to  these drolleries.    [Footnote 1: _Macacus pileatus_, Shaw and Desmarest. The  \"bonneted Macaque\" is common in the south and west; it is replaced on  the neighbouring coast of the Peninsula of India by the Toque, _M.  radiatus_, which closely resembles it in size, habit, and form, and  in the peculiar appearance occasioned by the hairs radiating from the  crown of the head. A spectacled monkey is _said_ to inhabit the  low country near to Bintenne; but I have never seen one brought  thence. A paper by Dr. TEMPLETON, in the _Mag. Nat.
