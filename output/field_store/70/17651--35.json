[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11560"],[0,"The Barbarism of Berlin (#4)"],[1,"  it is not a case of mere bloodshed or military bravado. The duel, for  example, can legitimately be called a barbaric thing; but the word is  here used in another sense. There are duels in Germany; but so there are  in France, Italy, Belgium and Spain; indeed, there are duels wherever  there are dentists, newspapers, Turkish baths, time-tables, and all the  curses of civilisation; except in England and a corner of America. You  may happen to regard the duel as an historic relic of the more barbaric  States on which these modern States were built. It might equally well be  maintained that the duel is everywhere the sign of high civilisation;  being the sign of its more delicate sense of honour, its more vulnerable  vanity, or its greater dread of social disrepute. But whichever of the two  views you take, you must concede that the essence of the duel is an armed  equality. I should not, therefore, apply the word barbaric, as I am using  it, to the duels of German officers or even to the broadsword combats  that are conventional among the German students. I do not see why a young  Prussian should not have scars all over his face if he likes them; nay,  they are often the redeeming points of interest on an otherwise somewhat  unenlightening countenance. The duel may be defended; the sham duel may be  defended.    What cannot be defended is something really peculiar to Prussia, of which  we hear numberless stories, some of them certainly true. It might be called  the one-sided duel. I mean the idea that there is some sort of dignity  in drawing the sword upon a man who has not got a sword; a waiter, or a  shop assistant, or even a schoolboy. One of the officers of the Kaiser  in the affair at Saberne was found industriously hacking at a cripple. In  all these matters I would avoid sentiment. We must not lose our tempers  at the mere cruelty of the thing; but pursue the strict psychological  distinction. Others besides German soldiers have slain the defenceless,  for loot or lust or private malice, like any other murderer. The point is  that nowhere else but in Prussian Germany is any theory of honour mixed  up with such things; any more than with poisoning or picking pockets. No  French, English, Italian or American gentleman would think he had in some  way cleared his own character by sticking his sabre through some ridiculous  greengrocer who had nothing in his hand but a cucumber. It would seem as if  the word which is translated from the German as \"honour,\" must really mean  something quite different in German. It seems to mean something more like  what we should call \"prestige.\"    The fundamental fact, however, is the absence of the reciprocal idea. The  Prussian is not sufficiently civilised for the duel. Even when he crosses  swords with us his thoughts are not as our thoughts; when we both glorify  war, we are glorifying different things. Our medals are wrought like his,  but they do not mean the same thing; our regiments are cheered as his are,  but the thought in the heart is not the same; the Iron Cross is on the  bosom of his king, but it is not the sign of our God. For we, alas, follow  our God with many relapses and self-contradictions, but he follows his very  consistently. Through all the things that we have examined, the view of  national boundaries, the view of military methods, the view of personal  honour and self-defence, there runs in their case something of an atrocious  simplicity; something too simple for us to understand: the idea that glory  consists in holding the steel, and not in facing it.    If further examples were necessary, it would be easy to give hundreds  of them. Let us leave, for the moment, the relation between man and man  in the thing called the duel. Let us take the relation between man and  woman, in that immortal duel which we call a marriage. Here again we shall  find that other Christian civilisations aim at some kind of equality;  even if the balance be irrational or dangerous. Thus, the two extremes  of the treatment of women might be represented by what are called the  respectable classes in America and in France. In America they choose the  risk of comradeship; in France the compensation of courtesy. In America it  is practically possible for any young gentleman to take any young lady for  what he calls (I deeply regret to say) a joyride; but at least the man goes  with the woman as much as the woman with the man. In France the young woman  is protected like a nun while she is unmarried; but when she is a mother  she is really a holy woman; and when she is a grandmother she is a holy  terror. By both extremes the woman gets something back out of life. There  is only one place where she gets little or nothing back; and that is the  north of Germany. France and America aim alike at equality--America by  similarity; France by dissimilarity. But North Germany does definitely  aim at inequality. The woman stands up, with no more irritation than a  butler; the man sits down, with no more embarrassment than a guest. This is  the cool affirmation of inferiority, as in the case of the sabre and the  tradesman. \"Thou goest with women; forget not thy whip,\" said Nietzsche.  It will be observed that he does not say \"poker\"; which might come more  naturally to the mind of a more common or Christian wife-beater. But then  a poker is a part of domesticity; and might be used by the wife as well as  the husband. In fact, it often, is. The sword and the whip are the weapons  of a privileged caste.    Pass from the closest of all differences, that between husband and wife,  to the most distant of all differences, that of the remote and unrelated  races who have seldom seen each other's faces, and never been tinged  with each other's blood. Here we still find the same unvarying Prussian  principle. Any European might feel a genuine fear of the Yellow Peril; and  many Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Russians have felt and expressed it. Many  might say, and have said, that the Heathen Chinee is very heathen indeed;  that if he ever advances against us he will trample and torture and utterly  destroy, in a way that Eastern people do, but Western people do not. Nor do  I doubt the German Emperor's sincerity when he sought to point out to us  how abnormal and abominable such a nightmare campaign would be, supposing  that it could ever come. But now comes the comic irony; which never fails  to follow on the attempt of the Prussian to be philosophic. For the Kaiser,  after explaining to his troops how important it was to avoid Eastern  Barbarism, instantly commanded them to become Eastern Barbarians. He told  them, in so many words, to be Huns: and leave nothing living or standing  behind them. In fact, he frankly offered a new army corps of aboriginal  Tartars to the Far East, within such time as it may take a bewildered  Hanoverian to turn into a Tartar. Anyone who has the painful habit of  personal thought will perceive here at once the non-reciprocal principle  again. Boiled down to its bones of logic, it means simply this: \"I am a  German and you are a Chinaman. Therefore I, being a German, have a right  to be a Chinaman. But you have no right to be a Chinaman; because you  are only a Chinaman.\" This is probably the highest point to which German  culture has risen.    The principle here neglected, which may be called Mutuality by those who  misunderstand and dislike the word Equality, does not offer so clear a  distinction between the Prussian and the other peoples as did the first  Prussian principle of an infinite and destructive opportunism; or, in  other words, the principle of being unprincipled. Nor upon this second  can one take up so obvious a position touching the other civilisations or  semi-civilisations of the world. Some idea of oath and bond there is in the  rudest tribes, in the darkest continents. But it might be maintained, of  the more delicate and imaginative element of reciprocity, that a cannibal  in Borneo understands it almost as little as a professor in Berlin. A  narrow and one-sided seriousness is the fault of barbarians all over the  world. This may have been the meaning, for aught I know, of the one eye of  the Cyclops: that the Barbarian cannot see round things or look at them  from two points of view; and thus becomes a blind beast and an eater of  men. Certainly there can be no better summary of the savage than this,  which, as we have seen, unfits him for the duel. He is the man who cannot  love--no, nor even hate--his neighbour as himself.    But this quality in Prussia does have one effect which has reference  to the same quest of the lower civilisations. It disposes once and  for all at least of the civilising mission of Germany. Evidently the  Germans are the last people in the world to be trusted with the task. They  are as shortsighted morally as physically. What is their sophism of  \"necessity\" but an inability to imagine to-morrow morning? What is their  non-reciprocity but an inability to imagine, not a god or devil, but  merely another man? Are these to judge mankind? Men of two tribes in  Africa not only know that they are all men, but can understand that they  are all black men. In this they are quite seriously in advance of the  intellectual Prussian; who cannot be got to see that we are all white  men. The ordinary eye is unable to perceive in the North-East Teuton,  anything that marks him out especially from the more colourless classes of  the rest of Aryan mankind. He is simply a white man, with a tendency to  the grey or the drab. Yet he will explain, in serious official documents,  that the difference between him and us is a difference between \"the  master-race and the inferior-race.\" The collapse of German philosophy  always occurs at the beginning, rather than the end of an argument; and the  difficulty here is that there is no way of testing which is a master-race  except by asking which is your own race. If you cannot find out (as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#4)"],[1,"know already--that the king, driven from London by the traitors of  Parliament, who would take from him all power, would override the peers,  and abolish the Church, has appealed to his faithful subjects to stand  by him, and to maintain his cause. He will, ere a fortnight be past,  raise his banner at Nottingham. Already Sir John Hotham, the rebel  Governor of York, has closed the gates of that city to him, and it is  time that all loyal men were on foot to aid his cause. Lord Falkland has  been pleased to grant me a commission to raise a troop of horse in his  service, and I naturally come to you first, to ask you to follow me.\"    He paused a moment, and a shout of assent rang through the hall.    \"There are,\" he said, \"some among you whom years may prevent from  yourselves undertaking the hardships of the field, but these can send  substitutes in their sons. You will understand that none are compelled  to go; but I trust that from the long-standing friendship between us,  and from the duty which you each owe to the king, none will hold back.  Do I understand that all here are willing to join, or to furnish  substitutes?\"    A general shout of \"All\" broke from the tenants.    \"Thank you, my friends, I expected nothing else. This will give me fifty  good men, and true, and I hope that each will be able to bring with him  one, two, or more men, in proportion to the size of his holding. I shall  myself bear the expense of the arms and outfit of all these; but we must  not strip the land of hands. Farming must still go on, for people must  feed, even if there be war. As to the rents, we must waive our  agreements while the war lasts. Each man will pay me what proportion of  his rent he is able, and no more. The king will need money as well as  men, and as all I receive will be at his service, I know that each of  you will pay as much as he can to aid the common cause. I have here a  list of your names. My son will take it round to each, and will write  down how many men each of you may think to bring with him to the war. No  man must be taken unwillingly. I want only those whose hearts are in the  cause. My son is grieving that he is not old enough to ride with us; but  should aught befall me in the strife, I have bade him ride and take his  place among you.\"    Another cheer arose, and Harry went round the table taking down the  names and numbers of the men, and when his total was added up, it was  found that those present believed that they could bring a hundred men  with them into the field.    \"This is beyond my hopes,\" Sir Harry said, as amid great cheering he  announced the result. \"I myself will raise another fifty from my grooms,  gardeners, and keepers, and from brave lads I can gather in the village,  and I shall be proud indeed when I present to his majesty two hundred  men of Furness, ready to die in his defense.\"    After this there was great arrangement of details. Each tenant gave a  list of the arms which he possessed and the number of horses fit for  work, and as in those days, by the law of the land each man, of  whatsoever his degree, was bound to keep arms in order to join the  militia, should his services be required for the defense of the kingdom,  the stock of arms was, with the contents of Sir Henry's armory, found to  be sufficient for the number of men who were to be raised. It was eight  o'clock in the evening before all was arranged, and the party broke up  and separated to their homes.    For the next week there was bustle and preparation on the Furness  estates, as, indeed, through all England. As yet, however, the  Parliament were gathering men far more rapidly than the king. The  Royalists of England were slow to perceive how far the Commons intended  to press their demands, and could scarcely believe that civil war was  really to break out. The friends of the Commons, however, were  everywhere in earnest. The preachers in the conventicles throughout the  land denounced the king in terms of the greatest violence, and in almost  every town the citizens were arming and drilling. Lord Essex, who  commanded the Parliamentary forces, was drawing toward Northampton with  ten thousand men, consisting mainly of the train-bands of London; while  the king, with only a few hundred followers, was approaching Nottingham,  where he proposed to unfurl his standard and appeal to his subjects.    In a week from the day of the appeal of Sir Henry two troops, each of a  hundred men strong, drew up in front of Furness Hall. To the eye of a  soldier accustomed to the armies of the Continent, with their bands  trained by long and constant warfare, the aspect of this troop might not  have appeared formidable. Each man was dressed according to his fancy.  Almost all wore jack-boots coming nigh to the hip, iron breast and back  pieces, and steel caps. Sir Henry Furness and four gentlemen, his  friends, who had seen service in the Low Countries, and had now gladly  joined his band, took their places, Sir Henry himself at the head of the  body, and two officers with each troop. They, too, were clad in high  boots, with steel breast and back pieces, thick buff leather gloves, and  the wide felt hats with feathers which were worn in peace time. During  the war some of the Royalist officers wore iron caps as did their foes.  But the majority, in a spirit of defiance and contempt of their enemies,  wore the wide hat of the times, which, picturesque and graceful as it  was, afforded but a poor defense for the head. Almost all wore their  hair long and in ringlets, and across their shoulders were the white  scarfs typical of their loyalty to the king. Harry bestrode a fine horse  which his father had given him, and had received permission to ride for  half the day's march by his side at the head of the troop. The trumpeter  sounded the call, Sir Henry stood up in his stirrups, drew his sword and  waved it over his head, and shouted \"For God and King.\" Two hundred  swords flashed in the air, and the answering shout came out deep and  full. Then the swords were sheathed, the horses' heads turned, and with  a jingle of sabers and accouterments the troop rode gayly out through  the gates of the park.    Upon their way north they were joined by more than one band of Cavaliers  marching in the same direction, and passed, too, several bodies of  footmen, headed by men with closely-cropped heads, and somber figures,  beside whom generally marched others whom their attire proclaimed to be  Puritan preachers, on their way to join the army of Essex. The parties  scowled at each other as they passed; but as yet no sword had been drawn  on either side, and without adventure they arrived at Nottingham.    Having distributed his men among the houses of the town, Sir Henry  Furness rode to the castle, where his majesty had arrived the day  before. He had already the honor of the personal acquaintance of the  king, for he had in one of the early parliaments sat for Oxford.  Disgusted, however, with the spirit that prevailed among the opponents  of the king, and also by the obstinacy and unconstitutional course  pursued by his majesty, he had at the dissolution of Parliament retired  to his estate, and when the next House was summoned, declined to stand  again for his seat.    \"Welcome, Sir Henry,\" his majesty said graciously to him, \"you are  among the many who withstood me somewhat in the early days of my reign,  and perchance you were right to do so; but who have now, in my need,  rallied round me, seeing whither the purpose of these traitorous  subjects of mine leads them. You are the more welcome that you have, as  I hear, brought two hundred horsemen with you, a number larger than any  which has yet joined me. These,\" he said, pointing to two young noblemen  near him, \"are my nephews, Rupert and Maurice, who have come to join  me.\"    Upon making inquiries, Sir Henry found that the prospects of the king  were far from bright. So far, the Royalists had been sadly behindhand  with their preparations. The king had arrived with scarce four hundred  men. He had left his artillery behind at York for want of carriage, and  his need in arms was even greater than in men, as the arsenals of the  kingdom had all been seized by the Parliament. Essex lay at Northampton  with ten thousand men, and had he at this time advanced, even the most  sanguine of the Royalists saw that the struggle would be a hopeless one.    The next day, at the hour appointed, the royal standard was raised on  the Castle of Nottingham, in the midst of a great storm of wind and  rain, which before many hours had passed blew the royal standard to the  ground--an omen which those superstitiously inclined deemed of evil  augury indeed. The young noblemen and gentlemen, however, who had  gathered at Northampton, were not of a kind to be daunted by omens and  auguries, and finding that Essex did not advance and hearing news from  all parts of the country that the loyal gentlemen were gathering their  tenants fast, their hopes rose rapidly. There was, indeed, some  discontent when it was known that, by the advice of his immediate  councilors, King Charles had dispatched the Earl of Southampton with  Sir John Collpeper and Sir William Uvedale to London, with orders to  treat with the Commons. The Parliament, however, refused to enter into  any negotiations whatever until the king lowered his standard and  recalled the proclamation which he had issued. This, which would have  been a token of absolute surrender to the Parliament, the king refused  to do. He attempted a further negotiation; but this also failed.    The troops at Nottingham now amounted to eleven hundred men, of which  three hundred were infantry raised by Sir John Digby, the sheriff of the  county. The other eight hundred were horse. Upon the breaking off of  negotiations, and the advance of Essex, the king, sensible that he was  unable to resist the advance of Essex, who had now fifteen thousand"]]]
