She may look round: she is not adamant.        [_Sings_] Hippomenes, when he a maid would wed,      Took apples in his hand and on he sped.      Famed Atalanta's heart was won by this;      She marked, and maddening sank in Love's abyss.          From Othrys did the seer Melampus stray      To Pylos with his herd: and lo there lay      In a swain's arms a maid of beauty rare;      Alphesiboea, wise of heart, she bare.          Did not Adonis rouse to such excess      Of frenzy her whose name is Loveliness,      (He a mere lad whose wethers grazed the hill)      That, dead, he's pillowed on her bosom still?          Endymion sleeps the sleep that changeth not:      And, maiden mine, I envy him his lot!      Envy Iasion's: his it was to gain      Bliss that I dare not breathe in ears profane.          My head aches. What reck'st thou? I sing no more:      E'en where I fell I'll lie, until the wolves      Rend me--may that be honey in thy mouth!          IDYLL IV.      The Herdsmen.    _BATTUS. CORYDON._        BATTUS.      Who owns these cattle, Corydon? Philondas? Prythee say.        CORYDON.      No, AEgon: and he gave them me to tend while he's away.        BATTUS.      Dost milk them in the gloaming, when none is nigh to see?        CORYDON.      The old man brings the calves to suck, and keeps an eye on me.        BATTUS.      And to what region then hath flown the cattle's rightful lord?        CORYDON.      Hast thou not heard? With Milo he vanished Elis-ward.        BATTUS.      How! was the wrestler's oil e'er yet so much as seen by him?        CORYDON.      Men say he rivals Heracles in lustiness of limb.        BATTUS.      I'm Polydeuces' match (or so my mother says) and more.        CORYDON.      --So off he started; with a spade, and of these ewes a score.        BATTUS.      This Milo will be teaching wolves how they should raven next.        CORYDON.      --And by these bellowings his kine proclaim how sore they're vexed.        BATTUS.      Poor kine! they've found their master a sorry knave indeed.        CORYDON.      They're poor enough, I grant you: they have not heart to feed.        BATTUS.      Look at that heifer! sure there's naught, save bare bones, left of her.      Pray, does she browse on dewdrops, as doth the grasshopper?        CORYDON.      Not she, by heaven! She pastures now by AEsarus' glades,      And handfuls fair I pluck her there of young and green grass-blades;      Now bounds about Latymnus, that gathering-place of shades.        BATTUS.      That bull again, the red one, my word but he is lean!      I wish the Sybarite burghers aye may offer to the queen      Of heaven as pitiful a beast: those burghers are so mean!        CORYDON.      Yet to the Salt Lake's edges I drive him, I can swear;      Up Physcus, up Neaethus' side--he lacks not victual there,      With dittany and endive and foxglove for his fare.        BATTUS.      Well, well! I pity AEgon. His cattle, go they must      To rack and ruin, all because vain-glory was his lust.      The pipe that erst he fashioned is doubtless scored with rust?        CORYDON.      Nay, by the Nymphs! That pipe he left to me, the self-same day      He made for Pisa: I am too a minstrel in my way:      Well the flute-part in '_Pyrrhus_' and in '_Glauca_' can I play.      I sing too '_Here's to Croton_' and '_Zacynthus O 'tis fair_,'      And '_Eastward to Lacinium_:'--the bruiser Milo there      His single self ate eighty loaves; there also did he pull      Down from its mountain-dwelling, by one hoof grasped, a bull,      And gave it Amaryllis: the maidens screamed with fright;      As for the owner of the bull he only laughed outright.        BATTUS.      Sweet Amaryllis! thou alone, though dead, art unforgot.      Dearer than thou, whose light is quenched, my very goats are not.      Oh for the all-unkindly fate that's fallen to my lot!        CORYDON.      Cheer up, brave lad! tomorrow may ease thee of thy pain:      Aye for the living are there hopes, past' hoping are the slain:      And now Zeus sends us sunshine, and now he sends us rain.        BATTUS.      I'm better. Beat those young ones off! E'en now their teeth attack      That olive's shoots, the graceless brutes! Back, with your white face,          back!        CORYDON.      Back to thy hill, Cymaetha! Great Pan, how deaf thou art!      I shall be with thee presently, and in the end thou'lt smart.      I warn thee, keep thy distance. Look, up she creeps again!      Oh were my hare-crook in nay hand, I'd give it to her then!        BATTUS.      For heaven's sake, Corydon, look here! Just now a bramble-spike      Ran, there, into my instep--and oh how deep they strike,      Those lancewood-shafts! A murrain light on that calf, I say!      I got it gaping after her. Canst thou discern it, pray?        CORYDON.      Ay, ay; and here I have it, safe in my finger-nails.        BATTUS.      Eh! at how slight a matter how tall a warrior quails!        CORYDON.      Ne'er range the hill-crest, Battus, all sandal-less and bare:      Because the thistle and the thorn lift aye their plumed heads there.        BATTUS.      --Say, Corydon, does that old man we wot of (tell me please!)      Still haunt the dark-browed little girl whom once he used to tease?        CORYDON.      Ay my poor boy, that doth he: I saw them yesterday      Down by the byre; and, trust me, loving enough were they.        BATTUS.      Well done, my veteran light-o'-love! In deeming thee mere man,      I wronged thy sire: some Satyr he, or an uncouth-limbed Pan.          IDYLL V.      The Battle of the Bards.      _COMETAS. LACON. MORSON_.          COMETAS.      Goats, from a shepherd who stands here, from Lacon, keep away:      Sibyrtas owns him; and he stole my goatskin yesterday.        LACON.      Hi! lambs! avoid yon fountain. Have ye not eyes to see      Cometas, him who filched a pipe but two days back from me?        COMETAS.      Sibyrtas' bondsman own a pipe? whence gotst thou that, and how?      Tootling through straws with Corydon mayhap's beneath thee now?        LACON.      'Twas Lycon's gift, your highness. But pray, Cometas, say,      What is that skin wherewith thou saidst that Lacon walked away?      Why, thy lord's self had ne'er a skin whereon his limbs to lay.        COMETAS.      The skin that Crocylus gave me, a dark one streaked with white,      The day he slew his she-goat. Why, thou wert ill with spite,      Then, my false friend; and thou would'st end by beggaring me quite.        LACON.      Did Lacon, did Calaethis' son purloin a goatskin? No,      By Pan that haunts the sea-beach! Lad, if I served thee so,      Crazed may I drop from yon hill-top to Crathis' stream below!        COMETAS.      Nor pipe of thine, good fellow--the Ladies of the Lake      So be still kind and good to me--did e'er Cometas take.        LACON.      Be Daphnis' woes my portion, should that my credence win!      Still, if thou list to stake a kid--that surely were no sin--      Come on, I'll sing it out with thee--until thou givest in.        COMETAS.      '_The hog he braved Athene._' As for the kid, 'tis there:      You stake a lamb against him--that fat one--if you dare.        LACON.      Fox! were that fair for either? At shearing who'd prefer      Horsehair to wool? or when the goat stood handy, suffer her      To nurse her firstling, and himself go milk a blatant cur?        COMETAS.      The same who deemed his hornet's-buzz the true cicala's note,      And braved--like you--his better. And so forsooth you vote      My kid a trifle? Then come on, fellow! I stake the goat.        LACON.      Why be so hot? Art thou on fire? First prythee take thy seat      'Neath this wild woodland olive: thy tones will sound more sweet.      Here falls a cold rill drop by drop, and green grass-blades uprear      Their heads, and fallen leaves are thick, and locusts prattle here.        COMETAS.      Hot I am not; but hurt I am, and sorely, when I think      That thou canst look me in the face and never bleach nor blink--      Me, thine own boyhood's tutor! Go, train the she-wolf's brood:      Train dogs--that they may rend thee! This, this is gratitude!        LACON.      When learned I from thy practice or thy preaching aught that's right,      Thou puppet, thou misshapen lump of ugliness and spite?        COMETAS.      When? When I beat thee, wailing sore: yon goats looked on with glee,      And bleated; and were dealt with e'en as I had dealt with thee.        LACON.      Well, hunchback, shallow be thy grave as was thy judgment then!      But hither, hither! Thou'lt not dip in herdsman's lore again.        COMETAS.      Nay, here are oaks and galingale: the hum of housing bees      Makes the place pleasant, and the birds are piping in the trees.      And here are two cold streamlets; here deeper shadows fall      Than yon place owns, and look what cones drop from the pinetree tall.        LACON.      Come hither, and tread on lambswool that is soft as any dream:      Still more unsavoury than thyself to me thy goatskins seem.      Here will I plant a bowl of milk, our ladies' grace to win;      And one, as huge, beside it, sweet olive-oil therein.        COMETAS.      Come hither, and trample dainty fern and poppy-blossom: sleep      On goatskins that are softer than thy fleeces piled three deep.      Here will I plant eight milkpails, great Pan's regard to gain,      Bound them eight cups: full honeycombs shall every cup contain.        LACON.      Well! there essay thy woodcraft: thence fight me, never budge      From thine own oak; e'en have thy way. But who shall be our judge?      Oh, if Lycopas with his kine should chance this way to trudge!        COMETAS.      Nay, I want no Lycopas. But hail yon woodsman, do:      'Tis Morson--see! his arms are full of bracken--there, by you.        LACON.      We'll hail him.        COMETAS.

Volume 19, No. 531, (#4)"],[1,"elevated to the peerage by  matrimony, or lowered by the undertaker into Westminster Abbey. As some  French Vaudevillist observed, \"Moliere was denied in France the rights of  sepulture, while        \"Garrick repose a cote de leur rois!\"      Yet, notwithstanding all this clamour of popularity--all this  infatuation--there is no branch of the arts so grossly neglected in  England as the drama. It is no longer the fashion in London to attend the  theatres. Owing partly to the increase of private amusements, and partly  to the late hours gradually adopted during the reign of George the Fourth,  the custom of play-going has declined among the higher classes, and  naturally produces the reaction of bad pieces and indifferent performers.  Even a clever actor, when satisfied that he is to receive judgment from an  unrefined and uneducated audience, will degenerate and grow slovenly; and  from what I have observed of the London stage, I see it is the custom to  daub for the galleries, or to creep through the business under cover of a  cold, tame mediocrity. Without the slightest patronage from the court or  substantial encouragement from the fosterers of literary merit, these  luckless personages are expected to attempt the same exertions and intense  study, which is rewarded, in foreign countries, by the most flattering and  judicious attention; as well as by a pension, to cheer the infirmities of  old age. Although tolerably well paid by his manager, the English actor  has the mortification of being tyrannized and insulted by the gallery, and  overlooked by the higher classes. A few persons of rank and fortune are  provided with private boxes at the national theatres; but these are  usually let by the night to plebeian tenants. It is rare indeed to observe  a family of distinction in the dress circle of either Drury Lane or Covent  Garden; while the French play is never deficient in a fashionable audience.    The Opera, too, is nightly becoming more crowded; while at the two patent  theatres \"a beggarly account of empty boxes,\" and an equally beggarly  account of flat, stale, and unprofitable performances, greets me whenever  I am rash enough to take my post of observation. Lady Romford has a  private box, which she visits only in preference to staying at a still  duller home, on a disengaged evening; and Bagot occasionally drags me to  the play, to make my foreign ignorance and inexperience a pretext for  following Lady Clara to a spot which no one seems to visit without an  apology. People in society give as many reasons for having done so strange  a thing as go to see the new tragedy, as they would invent in Paris to  excuse a similar omission.    Since the Kemble munia, and the Byron mania, there has been a general  affectation of indifference towards poetry and the drama; your true  fashionable never mentions either without ridicule--the natural  consequence of previously exaggerated enthusiasm.    But above all the absurdities connected with this national weakness,  stands that of the public prints. So much importance is given by the  newspapers to every thing relating to the histrionic art, that we are  daily informed of the whereabout of all the third-rate performers of the  minor theatres; that \"Mr. Smith, of Sadler's Wells, is engaged to Mr.  Ducrow for the ensuing season;\" or that \"Miss Brown, belonging to the  ballet department of the Surrey theatre, has sprained her ankle.\" While  two thirds of a leading print are occupied with details of the Reform Bill,  or a debate on some constitutional question,--or while the foreign  intelligence of two sieges and a battle is concentrated with a degree of  terseness worthy a telegraph, half a column is devoted to the plot of a  new melo-drama at the Coburg; or to a cut and dried criticism upon the  nine hundredth representation of _Hamlet_--beginning with the \"immortal  bard,\" and ending with the waistcoats of the grave-digger!--_The Opera, a  Novel_.           *       *       *       *       *      EUGENE ARAM.      The recollection of this man is still preserved at Lynn, in Norfolk, at  which town he was for some time usher at the grammar-school. A small room  at the back of the house, in which he slept, was, until these last few  years, (when it was pulled down and rebuilt,) mysteriously pointed to by  the little urchins as they passed up to bed of a cold, ghost-enticing  night, as the chamber in which the \"usher, who was hanged for murder,\" was  used to sleep.    The tradition which remains of his character is, that he was \"a man of  loneliness and mystery,\" sullen and reserved; that on half-holy-days, and  when his duties would allow, he strayed solitary and cheerless, as if to  avoid the world, amongst the flat uninteresting marshes which are situated  on the opposite side of the river Ouse.    At Lynn the character of Aram was, until his apprehension, unexceptionable;  but after that event, circumstances were then called to mind which seemed  to indicate a naturally dark character; but whether these were all  strictly founded in truth, or magnified suspicions arising from the  appaling circumstances of the crime of which he was convicted, I am unable  to determine. The following, derived from unquestionable authority, having  been related by Dr. L., who was master of the grammar-school at the time,  may serve as a sample:--there can be no doubt but that the worthy Dr.  himself believed his suspicions well founded, as he used to tremble when  he related it. It was customary for the parents of the scholars, on an  appointed day, to dine with the master, at which time it was expected they  would bring with them the amount of their bills. It was late at night,  after one of such meetings, that Dr. L. was awakened by a noise at his  bed-room door; he rose up, and going into the passage which led to the  staircase, but which was not in the direct way from Aram's bed room to the  ground-floor, he discovered the usher _dressed_. Having questioned him as  to the object of his rising at that unseasonable hour, Aram confusedly  answered that he had been taken unwell, and had been obliged to go do down  stairs. The Dr. then retired, unsuspiciously, to bed. From the combined  circumstances of the noise at the door, his great agitation and confusion,  and from his being found in the passage, the worthy Dr., in later years,  had no doubt, that, from its being known to Aram that a considerable sum  of money was in his bed-room, Aram intended nothing less than to rob him;  and no doubt, continued the narrator, he _would_ have murdered me too, if  it had been rendered necessary, from my discovering or opposing him.    The spot just at the entrance to the play-ground, at which Aram was taken  into custody by two strange men from Yorkshire, is still remarked, and  generally by the young scholar in a tremulous whisper.--_Literary Gazette_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      AGENCY OF MAN IN EXTINGUISHING OR SPREADING SPECIES.      Let us make some inquiries into the extent of the influence which the  progress of society has exerted, during the last seven or eight centuries,  in altering the distribution of our indigenous British animals. Dr.  Fleming has prosecuted this inquiry with his usual zeal and ability, and  in a memoir on the subject has enumerated the best authenticated examples  of the decrease or extirpation of certain species during a period when our  population has made the most rapid advances. We shall offer a brief  outline of his results.    The stag, as well as the fallow-deer, and the roe, were formerly so  abundant that, according to Lesley, from five hundred to a thousand were  sometimes slain at a hunting-match; but the native races would already  have been extinguished, had they not been carefully preserved in certain  forests. The otter, the marten, and the polecat, were also in sufficient  numbers to be pursued for the sake of their fur; but they have now been  reduced within very narrow bounds. The wild cat and fox have also been  sacrificed throughout the greater part of the country, for the security of  the poultry-yard or the fold. Badgers have been expelled from nearly every  district which at former periods they inhabited.    Besides these, which have been driven out from some haunts, and everywhere  reduced in number, there are some which have been wholly extirpated; such  as the ancient breed of indigenous horses, the wild boar and the wild oxen,  of which last, however, a few remains are still preserved in the parks of  some of our nobility. The beaver, which was eagerly sought after for its  fur, had become scarce at the close of the ninth century, and, by the  twelfth century, was only to be met with, according to Giraldus de Barri,  in one river in Wales, and another in Scotland. The wolf, once so much  dreaded by our ancestors, is said to have maintained its ground in Ireland  so late as the beginning of the eighteenth century (1710,) though it had  been extirpated in Scotland thirty years before, and in England at a much  earlier period. The bear, which in Wales was regarded as a beast of the  chase equal to the hare or the boar, only perished as a native of Scotland  in the year 1057.    Many native birds of prey have also been the subjects of unremitting  persecution. The eagles, larger hawks, and ravens, have disappeared from  the more cultivated districts. The haunts of the mallard, the snipe, the  redshank, and the bittern, have been drained equally with the summer  dwellings of the lapwing and the curlew. But these species still linger in  some portion of the British isles; whereas the large capercailzies, or  wood grouse, formerly natives of the pine forests of Ireland and Scotland,  have been destroyed within the last fifty years. The egret and the crane,  which appear to have been formerly very common in Scotland, are now only  occasional"]]]
