The text containing the Legend of the Destruction of Mankind is written  in hieroglyphs, and is found on the four walls of a small chamber which  is entered from the \"hall of columns\" in the tomb of Seti I., which is  situated on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes.  On the wall facing  the door of this chamber is painted in red the figure of the large \"Cow  of Heaven.\"  The lower part of her belly is decorated with a series of  thirteen stars, and immediately beneath it are the two Boats of Ra,  called Semketet and Mantchet, or Sektet and Matet.  Each of her four  legs is held in position by two gods, and the god Shu, with  outstretched uplifted arms, supports her body.  The Cow was published  by Champollion,[FN#5] without the text.  This most important  mythological text was first published and translated by Professor E.  Naville in 1874.[FN#6]  It was republished by Bergmann[FN#7] and  Brugsch,[FN#8] who gave a transcription of the text, with a German  translation.  Other German versions by Lauth,[FN#9] Brugsch,[FN#10] and  Wiedemann[FN#11] have appeared, and a part of the text was translated  into French by Lefebure.[FN#12]  The latest edition of the text was  published by Lefebure,[FN#13] and text of a second copy, very much  mutilated, was published by Professor Naville, with a French  translation in 1885.[FN#14]  The text printed in this volume is that of  M. Lefebure.        [FN#5]  Monuments, tom. iii., p. 245.    [FN#6]  Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch., vol. iv., p. 1 ff.    [FN#7]  Hieroglyphische Inschriften, Bl. 85 fl.

The legend takes us back to the time when the gods of Egypt went about  in the country, and mingled with men and were thoroughly acquainted  with their desires and needs.  The king who reigned over Egypt was Ra,  the Sun-god, who was not, however, the first of the Dynasty of Gods who  ruled the land.  His predecessor on the throne was Hephaistos, who,  according to Manetho, reigned 9000 years, whilst Ra reigned only 992  years; Panodorus makes his reign to have lasted less than 100 years.  Be this as it may, it seems that the \"self-created and self-begotten\"  god Ra had been ruling over mankind for a very long time, for his  subjects were murmuring against him, and they were complaining that he  was old, that his bones were like silver, his body like gold, and his  hair like lapis-lazuli.  When Ra heard these murmurings he ordered his  bodyguard to summon all the gods who had been with him in the primeval  World-ocean, and to bid them privately to assemble in the Great House,  which can be no other than the famous temple of Heliopolis.  This  statement is interesting, for it proves that the legend is of  Heliopolitan origin, like the cult of Ra itself, and that it does not  belong, at least in so far as it applies to Ra, to the Predynastic  Period.    When Ra entered the Great Temple, the gods made obeisance to him, and  took up their positions on each side of him, and informed him that they  awaited his words.  Addressing Nu, the personification of the World-  ocean, Ra bade them to take notice of the fact that the men and women  whom his Eye had created were murmuring against him.  He then asked  them to consider the matter and to devise a plan of action for him, for  he was unwilling to slay the rebels without hearing what his gods had  to say.  In reply the gods advised Ra to send forth his Eye to destroy  the blasphemers, for there was no eye on earth that could resist it,  especially when it took the form of the goddess Hathor.  Ra accepted  their advice and sent forth his Eye in the form of Hathor to destroy  them, and, though the rebels had fled to the mountains in fear, the Eye  pursued them and overtook them and destroyed them.  Hathor rejoiced in  her work of destruction, and on her return was praised by Ra, for what  she had done.  The slaughter of men began at Suten-henen  (Herakleopolis), and during the night Hathor waded about in the blood  of men.  Ra asserted his intention of being master of the rebels, and  this is probably referred to in the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., in  which it is said that Ra rose as king for the first time in Suten-  henen.  Osiris also was crowned at Suten-henen, and in this city lived  the great Bennu bird, or Phoenix, and the \"Crusher of Bones\" mentioned  in the Negative Confession.    The legend now goes on to describe an act of Ra, the significance of  which it is difficult to explain.  The god ordered messengers to be  brought to him, and when they arrived, he commanded them to run like  the wind to Abu, or the city of Elephantine, and to bring him large  quantities of the fruit called tataat.  What kind of fruit this was is  not clear, but Brugsch thought they were \"mandrakes,\" the so-called  \"love-apples,\" and this translation of tataat may be used  provisionally.  The mandrakes were given to Sekti, a goddess of  Heliopolis, to crush and grind up, and when this was done they were  mixed with human blood, and put in a large brewing of beer which the  women slaves had made from wheat.  In all they made 7,000 vessels of  beer.  When Ra saw the beer he approved of it, and ordered it to be  carried up the river to where the goddess Hathor was still, it seems,  engaged in slaughtering men.  During the night he caused this beer to  be poured out into the meadows of the Four Heavens, and when Hathor  came she saw the beer with human blood and mandrakes in it, and drank  of it and became drunk, and paid no further attention to men and women.  In welcoming the goddess, Ra, called her \"Amit,\" i.e., \"beautiful one,\"  and from this time onward \"beautiful women were found in the city of  Amit,\" which was situated in the Western Delta, near Lake  Mareotis.[FN#15]  Ra also ordered that in future at every one of his  festivals vessels of \"sleep-producing beer\" should be made, and that  their number should be the same as the number of the handmaidens of Ra.  Those who took part in these festivals of Hathor and Ra drank beer in  very large quantities, and under the influence of the \"beautiful  women,\" i.e., the priestesses, who were supposed to resemble Hathor in  their physical attractions, the festal celebrations degenerated into  drunken and licentious orgies.        [FN#15]  It was also called the \"City of Apis,\" (Brugsch, Dict. Geog.,  p. 491), and is the Apis city of classical writers.  It is, perhaps,  represented by the modern Kom al-Hisn.        Soon after this Ra complained that he was smitten with pain, and that  he was weary of the, children of men.  He thought them a worthless  remnant, and wished that more of them had been slain.  The gods about  him begged him to endure, and reminded him that his power was in  proportion to his will.  Ra was, however, unconsoled, and he complained  that his limbs were weak for the first time in his life.  Thereupon the  god Nu told Shu to help Ra, and he ordered Nut to take the great god Ra  on her back.  Nut changed herself into a cow, and with the help of Shu  Ra got on her back. As soon as men saw that Ra was on the back of the  Cow of Heaven, and was about to leave them, they became filled with  fear and repentance, and cried out to Ra to remain with them and to  slay all those who had blasphemed against him.  But the Cow moved on  her way, and carried Ra to Het-Ahet, a town of the nome of Mareotis,  where in later days the right leg of Osiris was said to be preserved.  Meanwhile darkness covered the land.  When day broke the men who had  repented of their blasphemies appeared with their bows, and slew the  enemies of Ra.  At this result Ra was pleased, and he forgave those who  had repented because of their righteous slaughter of his enemies.  From  this time onwards human sacrifices were offered up at the festivals of  Ra celebrated in this place, and at Heliopolis and in other parts of  Egypt.    After these things Ra declared to Nut that he intended to leave this  world, and to ascend into heaven, and that all those who would see his  face must follow him thither.  Then he went up into heaven and prepared  a place to which all might come.  Then he said, \"Hetep sekhet aa,\"  i.e., \"Let a great field be produced,\" and straightway \"Sekhet-hetep,\"  or the \"Field of peace,\" came into being.  He next said, \"Let there be  reeds (aaru) in it,\" and straightway \"Sekhet Aaru,\" or the \"Field of  Reeds,\" came into being.  Sekhet-hetep was the Elysian Fields of the  Egyptians, and the Field of Reeds was a well-known section of it.  Another command of the god Ra resulted in the creation of the stars,  which the legend compares to flowers.  Then the goddess Nut trembled in  all her body, and Ra, fearing that she might fall, caused to come into  being the Four Pillars on which the heavens are supported.  Turning to  Shu, Ra entreated him to protect these supports, and to place himself  under Nut, and to hold her up in position with his hands.  Thus Shu  became the new Sun-god in the place of Ra, and the heavens in which Ra  lived were supported and placed beyond the risk of falling, and mankind  would live and rejoice in the light of the new sun.    At this place in the legend a text is inserted called the \"Chapter of  the Cow.\"  It describes how the Cow of Heaven and the two Boats of the  Sun shall be painted, and gives the positions of the gods who stand by  the legs of the Cow, and a number of short magical names, or formulae,  which are inexplicable.  The general meaning of the picture of the Cow  is quite clear.

I had little  time to make melancholy reflections upon my situation; for on the fourth  day after my arrival, I was attacked by a violent fever, occasioned,  probably, by indulging too freely in the fine fruits which were then in  the Djidda market; an imprudence, which my abstemious diet, for the last  twelve months, rendered, perhaps, less inexcusable, but certainly of  worse consequence. I was for several days delirious; and nature would  probably have been exhausted, had it not been for the aid of a Greek  captain, my fellow passenger from Souakin. He attended me in one of my  lucid intervals, and, at my request, procured a barber, or country  physician, who bled me copiously, though with much reluctance, as he  insisted that a potion, made up of ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon, was the  only remedy adapted to my case. In a fortnight after, I had sufficiently  recovered to be able to walk about; but the weakness and languor which  the fever had occasioned, would not yield to the damp heat of the  atmosphere of the town; and I owed my complete recovery to the temperate  climate of Tayf, situated in the mountains behind Mekka, where I  afterwards proceeded.    The Djidda market little resembled those Negro markets, where a single  dollar would purchase two or three weeks provision of dhourra and  butter. The price of every thing had risen here to an unusual height,  the imports from the interior of Arabia having entirely ceased, while  the whole population of the Hedjaz, now increased by a Turkish army and  its numerous followers, and a host of pilgrims who were daily coming in,  wholly depended for its supply upon the imports from Egypt. My little  stock of money was therefore spent during my illness, and before I was  sufficiently recovered to walk out. The Greek captain, though he had  shown himself ready to afford me the common services of humanity, was  not disposed to trust to the    [p.3] honour or respectability of a man whom he knew to be entirely  destitute of money. I was in immediate want of a sum sufficient to  defray my daily expenses, and, no other means being left to procure it,  I was compelled to sell my slave: I regretted much the necessity for  parting with him, as I knew he had some affection for me, and he was  very desirous to remain with me. During my preceding journey he had  proved himself a faithful and useful companion; and although I have  since had several other slaves in my possession, I never found one equal  to him. The Greek captain sold him for me, in the slave-market of  Djidda, for forty-eight dollars. [This slave cost me sixteen dollars at  Shendy; thus, the profits of sale on one slave defrayed almost the whole  expense of the four months journey through Nubia, which I had performed  in the spring.]    The present state of the Hedjaz rendered travelling through it, in the  disguise of a beggar, or at least for a person of my outward appearance,  impracticable; and the slow progress of my recovery made me desirous of  obtaining comforts: I therefore equipped myself anew, in the dress of a  reduced Egyptian gentleman, and immediately wrote to Cairo for a supply  of money; but this I could hardly receive in less than three or four  months. Being determined, however, to remain in the Hedjaz until the  time of the pilgrimage in the following November, it became necessary  for me to find the means of procuring subsistence until my funds should  arrive. Had I been disappointed in all my hopes, I should then have  followed the example of numbers of the poor Hadjis, even those of  respectable families, who earn a daily subsistence, during their stay in  the Hedjaz, by manual labour; but before I resorted to this last  expedient, I thought I might try another. I had indeed brought with me a  letter of introduction from Seyd Mohammed el Mahrouky, [The original  characters of these and other names, both of persons and places, are  given in the Index of Arabic words at the end of this volume.] the first  merchant    [p.4] in Cairo, to Araby Djeylany, the richest merchant of Djidda; but  this I knew could be of no use, as it was not a letter of credit; and I  did not present it. [I afterwards became acquainted with Djeylany, at  Mekka; and what I saw of him, convinced me that I was not mistaken in  the estimation I had formed of his readiness to assist a stranger.] I  determined therefore, at last, to address the Pasha, Mohammed Aly, in  person. He had arrived in the Hedjaz at the close of the spring of 1813,  and was now resident at Tayf, where he had established the head-quarters  of the army, with which he intended to attack the strongholds of the  Wahabis. I had seen the Pasha several times at Cairo, before my  departure for Upper Egypt; and had informed him in general terms of my  travelling madness (as he afterwards jocularly termed it himself at  Tayf). I should here observe that, as the merchants of Upper Egypt are  in general poor, and none of them strictly honour a bill or obligation  by immediate payment, I had found it necessary, during my stay there, in  order to obtain a supply of money, to request my correspondent at Cairo  to pay the sum which I wanted into the Pashas treasury, and to take an  order from him upon his son, Ibrahim Pasha, then governor of Upper  Egypt, to repay me the amount. Having therefore already had some money  dealings with the Pasha, I thought that, without being guilty of too  much effrontery, I might now endeavour to renew them in the Hedjaz, and  the more so, as I knew that he had formerly expressed rather a  favourable opinion of my person and pursuits. As soon, therefore, as the  violence of my fever had subsided, I wrote to his physician, an Armenian  of the name of Bosari, whom I had also known at Cairo, where I had heard  much in his favour, and who was then with his master at Tayf. I begged  him to represent my unfortunate situation to the Pasha, to inform him  that my letter of credit upon Djidda had not been honoured, and to ask  him whether he would accept a bill upon    [p.5] my correspondent at Cairo, and order his treasurer at Djidda to  pay the amount of it.    Although Tayf is only five days distant from Djidda, yet the state of  the country was such, that private travellers seldom ventured to cross  the mountains between Mekka and Tayf; and caravans, which carried the  letters of the people of the country, departed only at intervals of from  eight to ten days; I could not, therefore, expect an answer to my letter  in less than twenty days. During this period I passed my leisure hours  at Djidda, in transcribing the journal of my travels in Nubia; but I  felt the heat at this season so oppressive, especially in my weak state,  that, except during a few hours early in the morning, I found no ease  but in the cool shade of the great gateway of the Khan in which I  lodged; where I passed the greater part of the day, stretched upon a  stone bench. Bosaris correspondent at Djidda, through whom I had sent  my letter to Tayf, had meanwhile mentioned my name to Yahya Effendi, the  physician of Tousoun Pasha, son of Mohammed Aly, now governor of Djidda,  who had been in Upper Egypt while I was there, but I had not seen him.  This physician, when at Cairo, had heard my name mentioned as that of a  traveller; and understanding now, that I came from the Black countries,  he was curious to see me, and desired Bosaris friend to introduce me to  him. He received me politely, invited me repeatedly to his house, and,  in the course of further explanation, became acquainted with my wants,  and the steps I had taken to relieve them. He happened at this time to  be preparing for a journey to Medina with Tousoun Pasha, and was sending  back all his unnecessary baggage to Cairo; with this he was also  desirous to transmit to his family his last years savings, amounting to  three thousand piastres (about 100l.), and he was so kind as to offer me  the money for a bill upon Cairo, payable at sight; an advantage which,  he well knew, the merchants of Djidda never insure to those who take  their bills. Such an offer would not be considered as conferring    [p.6] any obligation in the commercial towns of Europe; but in the East,  and under the circumstances in which I was placed, it was extraordinary.  Yahya Effendi added, that some of his friends had given me a flattering  character while at Cairo, and that he could not, therefore, entertain  the slightest doubt of my solvency and respectability, in which opinion  he had been confirmed on reading the letter of credit I had brought with  me. As the issue of my application to the Pasha at Tayf was uncertain, I  readily and gratefully accepted Yahyas proposal; the money was  immediately paid to me, the bills drawn, and a few days after, my  obliging friend departed with Tousoun Pasha for Medina, where I had the  pleasure of seeing him again early in the following year.    I was now in possession of a sum sufficient to banish all apprehension  of suffering from poverty before the arrival of fresh supplies from  Egypt, whatever might be the consequence of my application to the Pasha;  but Yahya Effendi was no sooner gone, than I received a somewhat  favourable answer to the letter I had written to Tayf. Bosari, it  appeared, had been rather unwilling to urge my request to the Pasha,  afraid, perhaps, that he might himself become a sufferer, should I  forfeit my word. The Pasha, however, had heard of my being at Djidda,  through another person in his suite, whom I had seen there, and who had  arrived at Tayf; and hearing that I was walking about in rags, he  immediately despatched a messenger, with two dromedaries, to the  collector of customs at Djidda, Seyd Aly Odjakly, in whose hands was the  management of all the affairs of the town, with an order to furnish me a  suit of clothes, and a purse of five hundred piastres as travelling"]]]
