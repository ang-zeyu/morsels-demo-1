The rule of the German-Magyar minority over the Slav and Latin majority,  finally established by the introduction of dualism in 1867, was made  possible only by the demoralising system of violence described above. One  race was pitted against the other in Austria and this enabled the Germans  to rule them better, while the Magyars in Hungary, by keeping their subject  races in the darkness of ignorance and by using the most abominable methods  of violence, succeeded in securing for themselves the entire monopoly of  government. The Magyars, who are a race of Asiatic origin, are truly the  faithful descendants of the ancient Huns, and true allies of the Huns  of to-day.    When Kossuth came to England in 1848, he was hailed as the champion of  freedom and liberty, and entranced his audiences in London and other  English cities by his remarkable oratory. As a matter of fact Kossuth,  though called \"the father of the Magyars,\" was himself a denationalised  Slovak; instead of a \"champion of liberty,\" he might with much greater  justification have been called the champion of the greatest racial tyranny  in Europe. For even then, while fighting for their own liberty and for the  independence of Hungary, the Magyars denied the most elementary political  and national rights to the other peoples living in Hungary.    In 1910 there were 2,202,165 Slovaks in Hungary according to the official  census. These two million Slovaks had only two deputies (Dr. Blaho and  Juriga), while the 8,651,520 Magyars had 405 seats, so that every Slovak  deputy represented one million electors, every Magyar deputy, however,  21,000. As regards administration, all civil service officials in Hungary  have to be of Magyar nationality. The cases of persecution for political  offences are innumerable: Slovak candidates were prevented from being  elected by being imprisoned. Corruption and violence are the two main  characteristics of all elections in \"democratic\" Hungary. Even to-day when  some Radicals in Budapest talk of electoral reform, they want suffrage to  be extended to Magyar electors only, and also stipulate that the candidates  shall be of Magyar nationality. No Magyar politicians will ever abandon the  programme of the territorial integrity of Hungary, their aims being  expressed in the words of Koloman Tisza: \"For the sake of the future of the  Magyar State it is necessary for Hungary to become a state where only  Magyar is spoken. To gain the Slovaks or to come to a compromise with them  is out of the question. There is only one means which is  effective--Extirpation!\" And this aim the Magyars have faithfully kept  before them for at least the last hundred years.    In the same way also the economic development of the non-Magyar  nationalities has been systematically hampered, because the Magyars know  that economic dependence means also political subservience. The Slovaks and  Rumanians are not allowed to found co-operative societies or banks on the  ground that such institutions \"are opposed to the interests of the elements  which hold the Magyar State together.\"    But it is not only the non-Magyars who suffer. The Magyar working classes  and the majority of the Magyar country people themselves are deprived of  political rights, for Hungary is ruled by an oligarchy and scarcely 5 per  cent. of the population has the suffrage right.    We may say, therefore, without exaggeration that to-day Hungary is the most  reactionary country of Europe. Nowhere else (not even in Prussia) have the  people so little power as in Hungary, where the Socialists have not a  single seat in parliament. The \"politics\" in Hungary are the privilege of a  few aristocrats. Hungary is a typical oligarchic and theocratic state.    When the Magyars plead to-day for \"peace without annexations\" and for the  integrity of Hungary, they want to be allowed to continue to oppress and  systematically magyarise the Slavs and Rumanians of Hungary. The triumphant  allied democracies will not, however, stoop before autocratic Hungary. The  dismemberment of Hungary, according to the principle of nationality, is a  _sine qua non_ of a permanent and just peace in Europe.    5. The four strongest races in Austria-Hungary, then, are the Germans,  Magyars, Czecho-Slovaks and Yugoslavs, numbering from eight to ten million  each. The Austrian Germans and the Magyars occupy the centre, while the  Czecho-Slovaks inhabit the north (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia),  and the Yugoslavs ten provinces in the southern part of the monarchy. In  order to facilitate German penetration and domination and to destroy the  last remnants of Bohemia's autonomous constitution, the Austrian Government  attempted, by the imperial decree of May 19, 1918, to dismember Bohemia  into twelve administrative districts with German officials at the head, who  were to possess the same power to rule their respective districts as had  hitherto appertained only to the Governor (Statthalter) of Bohemia, legally  responsible to the Bohemian Diet.    But not only are the Czecho-Slovaks and Yugoslavs divided between both  halves of the monarchy and among numerous administrative districts which  facilitate German penetration. Dissensions were fomented among the  different parties of these two nations and religious differences exploited.  The Yugoslavs, for instance, consist of three peoples: the Serbs and  Croats, who speak the same language and differ only in religion and  orthography, the former being Orthodox and the latter Catholic; and the  Slovenes, who speak a dialect of Serbo-Croatian and form the most western  outpost of the Yugoslav (or Southern Slav) compact territory. It was the  object of the Austrian Government to exploit these petty differences among  Yugoslavs so as to prevent them from realising that they form one and the  same nation entitled to independence. At the same time Austria has done all  in her power to create misunderstandings between the Slavs and Italians,  just as she tried to create dissensions between Poles and Ruthenes in  Galicia, and between Poles and Czechs in Silesia, well knowing that the  dominant races, the Germans and Magyars, would profit thereby. Fortunately  the war has opened the eyes of the subject peoples, and, as we shall show  later on, to-day they all go hand in hand together against their common  enemies in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest.        II    AUSTRIA-HUNGARY AND THE PRESENT WAR    In order to understand fully what is at stake in this war and why the Slavs  are so bitterly opposed to the further existence of Austria-Hungary, it is  necessary to study the foreign policy of the Central Powers during the past  century. The \"deepened alliance\" concluded between Germany and  Austria-Hungary in May, 1918, resulting in the complete surrender of  Austria's independence, is in fact the natural outcome of a long  development and the realisation of the hopes of Mitteleuropa cherished by  the Germans for years past. The scares about the dangers of \"Pan-slavism\"  were spread by the Germans only in order to conceal the real danger of  Pan-Germanism.    1. The original theory of Pan-Germanism was the consolidation and unity of  the whole German nation corresponding to the movement of the Italians for  national unity. In fact it was a German, Herder, who first proclaimed the  principle of nationality and declared the nation to be the natural organ of  humanity, as opposed to the idea of the state as an artificial  organisation: \"Nothing seems to be so opposed to the purpose of government  as an unnatural extension of territory of a state and a wild confusion of  holding different races and nations under the sway of a single sceptre.\" It  was this humanitarian philosophy recognising the natural rights of all  nations, great or small, to freedom which inspired the first Czech  regenerators such as Dobrovsky, Jungman and Kollar.    The legitimate claims of the Germans to national unity became unjust and  dangerous for Europe when the Germans began to think of subduing the whole  of Central Europe to their hegemony, which meant the subjugation of some  100 million Slavs and Latins. At first it was Austria which, as the head of  the former Holy Roman Empire, and the traditional bulwark of Germany in the  east (Osterreich--an eastern march), aspired to be the head of the  Pan-German Empire. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Austrian Emperor  became the head of the German Confederation. Prussia at that time entirely  gave way and left the leadership to Metternich's system of absolutism.    By and by, it became obvious that Austria was, on account of her non-German  population, internally weak, condemned to constant employment of violence  and reaction, and therefore unfit to stand at the head of a strong modern  Pan-Germany. Prussia therefore, as the greatest of the homogeneous German  states, became Austria's rival and was accepted by the Frankfurt Assembly  as the leader of the Confederation. The rivalry between Austria and Prussia "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#3)"],[1," equal success in our enquiries concerning the mental  powers and economy, if prosecuted with equal capacity and caution. It is  probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on  another; which, again, may be resolved into one more general and  universal: And how far these researches may possibly be carried, it will  be difficult for us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to  determine. This is certain, that attempts of this kind are every day  made even by those who philosophize the most negligently: And nothing  can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough  care and attention; that, if it lie within the compass of human  understanding, it may at last be happily achieved; if not, it may,  however, be rejected with some confidence and security. This last  conclusion, surely, is not desirable; nor ought it to be embraced too  rashly. For how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this  species of philosophy, upon such a supposition? Moralists have hitherto  been accustomed, when they considered the vast multitude and diversity  of those actions that excite our approbation or dislike, to search for  some common principle, on which this variety of sentiments might depend.  And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far, by their  passion for some one general principle; it must, however, be confessed,  that they are excusable in expecting to find some general principles,  into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved. The  like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even politicians:  Nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful; though perhaps longer  time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application may bring these  sciences still nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all  pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed more rash, precipitate,  and dogmatical, than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy,  that has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principles  on mankind.    10. What though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract,  and of difficult comprehension? This affords no presumption of their  falsehood. On the contrary, it seems impossible, that what has hitherto  escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and  easy. And whatever pains these researches may cost us, we may think  ourselves sufficiently rewarded, not only in point of profit but of  pleasure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our stock of  knowledge, in subjects of such unspeakable importance.    But as, after all, the abstractedness of these speculations is no  recommendation, but rather a disadvantage to them, and as this  difficulty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art, and the avoiding  of all unnecessary detail, we have, in the following enquiry, attempted  to throw some light upon subjects, from which uncertainty has hitherto  deterred the wise, and obscurity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite  the boundaries of the different species of philosophy, by reconciling  profound enquiry with clearness, and truth with novelty! And still more  happy, if, reasoning in this easy manner, we can undermine the  foundations of an abstruse philosophy, which seems to have hitherto  served only as a shelter to superstition, and a cover to absurdity  and error!        SECTION II.    OF THE ORIGIN OF IDEAS.      11. Every one will readily allow, that there is a considerable  difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the  pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he  afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by  his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of  the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of  the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them, even when they  operate with greatest vigour, is, that they represent their object in so  lively a manner, that we could _almost_ say we feel or see it: But,  except the mind be disordered by disease or madness, they never can  arrive at such a pitch of vivacity, as to render these perceptions  altogether undistinguishable. All the colours of poetry, however  splendid, can never paint natural objects in such a manner as to make  the description be taken for a real landskip. The most lively thought is  still inferior to the dullest sensation.    We may observe a like distinction to run through all the other  perceptions of the mind. A man in a fit of anger, is actuated in a very  different manner from one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell  me, that any person is in love, I easily understand your meaning, and  form a just conception of his situation; but never can mistake that  conception for the real disorders and agitations of the passion. When we  reflect on our past sentiments and affections, our thought is a faithful  mirror, and copies its objects truly; but the colours which it employs  are faint and dull, in comparison of those in which our original  perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice discernment or  metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them.    12. Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into  two classes or species, which are distinguished by their different  degrees of force and vivacity. The less forcible and lively are commonly  denominated _Thoughts_ or _Ideas_. The other species want a name in our  language, and in most others; I suppose, because it was not requisite  for any, but philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general term  or appellation. Let us, therefore, use a little freedom, and call them  _Impressions_; employing that word in a sense somewhat different from  the usual. By the term _impression_, then, I mean all our more lively  perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire,  or will. And impressions are distinguished from ideas, which are the  less lively perceptions, of which we are conscious, when we reflect on  any of those sensations or movements above mentioned.    13. Nothing, at first view, may seem more unbounded than the thought of  man, which not only escapes all human power and authority, but is not  even restrained within the limits of nature and reality. To form  monsters, and join incongruous shapes and appearances, costs the  imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and  familiar objects. And while the body is confined to one planet, along  which it creeps with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an instant  transport us into the most distant regions of the universe; or even  beyond the universe, into the unbounded chaos, where nature is supposed  to lie in total confusion. What never was seen, or heard of, may yet be  conceived; nor is any thing beyond the power of thought, except what  implies an absolute contradiction.    But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall  find, upon a nearer examination, that it is really confined within very  narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to  no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or  diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience. When  we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas,  _gold_, and _mountain_, with which we were formerly acquainted. A  virtuous horse we can conceive; because, from our own feeling, we can  conceive virtue; and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a  horse, which is an animal familiar to us. In short, all the materials of  thinking are derived either from our outward or inward sentiment: the  mixture and composition of these belongs alone to the mind and will. Or,  to express myself in philosophical language, all our ideas or more  feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones.    14. To prove this, the two following arguments will, I hope, be  sufficient. First, when we analyze our thoughts or ideas, however  compounded or sublime, we always find that they resolve themselves into  such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment.  Even those ideas, which, at first view, seem the most wide of this  origin, are found, upon a nearer scrutiny, to be derived from it. The  idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being,  arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and  augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. We  may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please; where we shall  always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar  impression. Those who would assert that this position is not universally  true nor without exception, have only one, and that an easy method of  refuting it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not  derived from this source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would  maintain our doctrine, to produce the impression, or lively perception,  which corresponds to it.    15. Secondly. If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is  not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find that he is  as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form  no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that  sense in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his  sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no  difficulty in conceiving these objects. The case is the same, if the  object, proper for exciting any sensation, has never been applied to the  organ. A Laplander or Negro has no notion of the relish of wine. And  though there are few or no instances of a like deficiency in the mind,  where a person has never felt or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or  passion that belongs to his species; yet we find the same observation to  take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form"]]]
