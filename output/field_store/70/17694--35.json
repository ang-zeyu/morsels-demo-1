On the other hand, it should  be stated that there is such a wide range of goods manufactured, and  additional varieties occasionally introduced, that it appears  possible to utilize all the kinds of fibre in any year; indeed, it  seems as if the available types of fibre each season create demands  for a corresponding type of manufactured product.    The crops produced will, obviously, vary in amount and value annually,  but a few figures will help the reader to estimate in some degree  the extent of the industry and its development in various parts of  the world.

The bales are raised quickly  from the hold by means of a hydraulic-engine, scarcely visible in Fig.  6 since it is at the far end of the vessel, but seen clearly in Fig.  7. When the bales are raised sufficiently high, they are guided to  the comparatively steep part of a chute from which they descend to  the more horizontal part as exemplified in Fig. 7. They are then  removed by means of hand-carts as shown, taken into the shed, and  piled or stored in some suitable arrangement with or without the aid  of a crane. Motor and other lorries are then used to convey the bales  to the various mills where the first actual process in what is termed  spinning takes place. It will be understood that the bales are stored  in the spinner's own stores after having been delivered as stated.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. HARBOUR PORTERS REMOVING BALES OF JUTE FROM  THE VESSEL SHOWN IN FIG. 6]          CHAPTER V.  MILL OPERATIONS    _Bale Opening_. Each spinner, as already indicated, stores his  bales of jute of various \"marks,\" i.e. qualities, in a convenient  manner, and in a store or warehouse from which any required number  of bales of each mark can be quickly removed to the preparing  department of the mill.    In the woollen industry, the term \"blending\" is used to indicate the  mixing of different varieties of material (as well as different  kinds of fibres) for the purpose of obtaining a mixture suitable for  the preparing and spinning of a definite quality and colour of  material. In much the same way, the term \"batching\" is used in the  jute industry, although it will be seen shortly that a more  extensive use is made of the word. A \"batch,\" in its simplest  definition, therefore indicates a number of bales which is suitable  for subsequent handling in the Batching Department. This number may  include 5, 6, 7 or more bales of jute according to the amount of  accommodation in the preparing department.    All the above bales of a batch may be composed of the same standard  quality of jute, although the marks may be different. It must be  remembered that although the marks have a distinct reference to  quality and colour, they actually represent some particular firm or  firms of balers or merchants. At other times, the batch of 5 to 10  bales may be composed of different qualities of jute, the number of  each kind depending partly upon the finished price of the yarn,  partly upon the colour, and partly upon the spinning properties of  the combination.    It will be understood that the purpose for which the finished yarn  is to be used will determine largely the choice of the bales for any  particular batch. For example, to refer to a simple differentiation,  the yarn which is to be used for the warp threads in the weaving of  cloth must, in nearly every case, have properties which differ in  some respects from the yarn which is to be used as weft for the same  cloth.    On the whole, it will be found advantageous, when the same grade of  jute is required, to select a batch from different balers' marks so  that throughout the various seasons an average quality may be  produced. The same class of yarn is expected at all times of the year,  but it is well known that the properties of any one mark may vary  from time to time owing to the slight variations in the manipulation  of the fibre at the farms, and to the variations of the weather  during the time of growth, and during the season generally.    A list of the bales for the batch is sent to the batching department,  this list being known as a \"batch-ticket.\" The bales are, of course,  defined by their marks, and those mentioned on the batch-ticket must  be rigidly adhered to for one particular class of yarn; if there is  any chance of one kind running short, the condition should be  notified in time so that a suitable mark may be selected to take its  place without effecting any great change in the character or quality  of the yarn.    When the number and kind of bales have been selected and removed  from the groups or parcels in the store or warehouse, they are  conveyed to the batching department, and placed in a suitable  position near the first machine in the series. It need hardly be  mentioned that since the fibre, during the operation of baling, is  subjected to such a high hydraulic pressure, the bale presents a  very solid and hard appearance, see Fig. 7, for the various  so-called \"heads\" of fibre have been squeezed together and forced  into a very small bulk. In such a state, the heads are quite  unfitted for the actual batching operation; they require to be opened  out somewhat so that the fibres will be more or less separated from  each other. This operation is termed \"opening\" and the process is  conducted in what is known as a \"bale opener,\" one type of which is  illustrated in Fig. 8, and made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,  Ltd., Dundee.    The various bales of the batch are arranged in a suitable manner  near the feed side of the machine, on the left in the view, so that  they can be handled to the best advantage. The bands or ropes, see  Fig. 7, are removed from the bale in order that the heads or large  pieces of jute can be separated. If any irregularity in the  selection of the heads from the different bales of the batch takes  place in this first selection of the heads of jute, the faulty  handling may affect subsequent operations in such a way that no  chance of correcting the defect can occur; it should be noted at  this stage that if there are slight variations of any kind in the  fibres, it is advisable to make special efforts to obtain a good  average mixture; as a matter of fact, it is wise to insist upon a  judicious selection in every case. The usual variations are--the  colour of the fibre, its strength, and the presence of certain  impurities such as stick, root, bark or specks; if the pieces of jute,  which are affected adversely by any of the above, are carefully  mixed with the otherwise perfect fibre, most of the faults may  disappear as the fibre proceeds on its way through the different  machines.    [Illustration: FIG. 8 BALE OPENER _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart,  Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.]    The layers of heads are often beaten with a heavy sledge hammer in  hand batching, but for machine batching a bale opener is used, and  this operation constitutes the preliminary opening. As already  indicated, the heads of jute are fed into the machine from the left  in Fig. 8, each head being laid on a travelling feed cloth which  carries the heads of jute successively between a pair of feed  rollers from which they are delivered to two pairs of very  deeply-fluted crushing rollers or breakers. The last pair of  deep-fluted rollers is seen clearly on the right in the figure.  These two pairs of heavy rollers crush and bend the compressed heads  of jute and deliver them in a much softer condition to the delivery  sheet on the right. The delivery sheet is an endless cloth which has  a continuous motion, and thus the softened heads are carried to the  extreme right, at which position they are taken from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#4)"],[1,"see a human maiden, serenely indifferent to the effect of her charms,  which so take the luckless lover that, like the boatman, he, Heine, is  probably doomed ere long to death in the waves.    Toward the outside world, then, Heine's habitual attitude is not that  of an interpreter; it is that of an artist who seeks the means of  expression where they may be found. He does not, like Goethe and  Moerike, read out of the phenomena of nature and of life what these  phenomena in themselves contain; he reads into them what he wishes  them to say. _The Book of Songs_ is a human document, but it is no  document of the life of humanity; it is a collection of kaleidoscopic  views of one life, a life not fortified by wholesome cooeperation with  men nor nourished with the strength of nature, but vivifying nature  with its own emotions. Heine has treated many a situation with  overwhelming pathos, but none from which he was himself so completely  absent as Moerike from the kitchen of The _Forsaken Maiden_. Goethe's  \"Hush'd on the hill\" is an apostrophe to himself; but peace which the  world cannot give and cannot take away is the atmosphere of that poem;  whereas Heine's \"The shades of the summer evening lie\" gets its  principal effectiveness from fantastic contributions of the poet's own  imagination.    The length to which Heine goes in attributing human emotions to nature  is hardly to be paralleled before or since. His aim not being the  reproduction of reality, nor yet the objectivation of ideas, his  poetry is essentially a poetry of tropes-that is, the conception and  presentation of things not as they are but as they may be conceived to  be. A simple illustration of this method may be seen in _The  Herd-Boy_. Uhland wrote a poem on a very similar subject, _The Boy's  Mountain Song_. But the contrast between Uhland's hardy, active,  public-spirited youth and Heine's sleepy, amorous individualist is no  more striking than the difference between Uhland's rhetorical and  Heine's tropical method. Heine's poem is an elaboration of the single  metaphor with which it begins: \"Kingly is the herd-boy's calling.\" The  poem _Pine and Palm_, in which Heine expresses his hopeless separation  from the maiden of whom he dreams--incidentally attributing to Amalie  a feeling of sadness and solitude to which she was a stranger--is a  bolder example of romantic self-projection into nature. But not the  boldest that Heine offers us. He transports us to India, and there--      The violets titter, caressing,      Peeping up as the planets appear,    And the roses, their warm love confessing,      Whisper words, soft perfumed, to each ear.    Nor does he allow us to question the occurrence of these marvels; how  do we know what takes place on the banks of the Ganges, whither we are  borne on the wings of song? This, indeed, would be Heine's answer to  any criticism based upon Ruskin's notion as to the \"pathetic fallacy.\"  If the setting is such as to induce in us the proper mood, we readily  enter the non-rational realm, and with credulous delight contemplate  wonders such as we too have seen in our dreams; just as we find the  romantic syntheses of sound and odor, or of sound and color,  legitimate attempts to express the inexpressible. The atmosphere of  prose, to be sure, is less favorable to Heine's habitual indulgence in  romantic tropes.    Somewhat blunted by over-employment is another romantic instrument,  eminently characteristic of Heine, namely, irony. Nothing could be  more trenchant than his bland assumption of the point of view of the  Jew-baiter, the hypocrite, or the slave-trader. It is as perfect as  his adoption of childlike faith in _The Pilgrimage to Kevlaar_. Many a  time he attains an effect of ironical contrast by the juxtaposition of  incongruous poems, as when a deification of his beloved is followed by  a cynical utterance of a different kind of love. But often the  incongruity is within the poem itself, and the poet, destroying the  illusion of his created image, gets a melancholy satisfaction from  derision of his own grief. This procedure perfectly symbolizes a  distracted mind; it undoubtedly suggests a superior point of view,  from which the tribulations of an insignificant individual are seen to  be insignificant; but in a larger sense it symbolizes the very  instability and waywardness of Heine himself. His emotions were  unquestionably deep and recurrent, but they were not constant. His  devotion to ideals did not preclude indulgence in very unideal  pleasures; and his love of Amalie and Therese, hopeless from the  beginning, could not, except in especially fortunate moments, avoid  erring in the direction either of sentimentality or of bitterness. But  Heine was too keenly intellectual to be indulgent of sentimentality,  and too caustic to restrain bitterness. Hence the bitter-sweet of many  of his pieces, so agreeably stimulating and so suggestive of an  elastic temperament.    There is, however, a still more pervasive incongruity between this  temperament and the forms in which it expressed itself. Heine's love  poems--two-thirds of the _Book of Songs_--are written in the very  simplest of verses, mostly quatrains of easy and seemingly inevitable  structure. Heine learned the art of making them from the _Magic Horn_,  from Uhland, and from Eichendorff, and he carried the art to the  highest pitch of virtuosity. They are the forms of the German  Folk-song, a fit vehicle for homely sentiments and those elemental  passions which come and go like the tide in a humble heart, because  the humble heart is single and yields unresistingly to their flow. But  Heine's heart was not single, his passion was complex, and the  greatest of his ironies was his use of the most unsophisticated of  forms for his most sophisticated substances. This, indeed, was what  made his love poetry so novel and so piquant to his contemporaries;  this is one of the qualities that keep it alive today; but it is a  highly individual device which succeeded only with this individual;  and that it was a device adopted from no lack of capacity in other  measures appears from the perfection of Heine's sonnets and the  incomparable free rhythmic verses of the _North Sea_ cycles.    Taken all in all, _The Book of Songs_ was a unique collection, making  much of little, and making it with an amazing economy of means.    III    Heine's first period, to 1831, when he was primarily a literary  artist, nearly coincides with the epoch of the Restoration  (1815-1830). Politically, this time was unproductive in Germany, and  the very considerable activity in science, philosophy, poetry,  painting, and other fine arts stood in no immediate relation to  national exigencies. There was indeed plenty of agitation in the  circles of the _Burschenschaft_, and there were sporadic efforts to  obtain from reluctant princes the constitutions promised as a reward  for the rising against Napoleon; but as a whole the people of the  various states seemed passive, and whatever was accomplished was the  work of individuals, with or without royal patronage, and, in the  main, in continuation of romantic tendencies. But with the Revolution  of July, 1830, the political situation in Germany became somewhat more  acute, demands for emancipation took more tangible form, and the  so-called \"Young Germans \"--Wienbarg, Gutzkow, Laube, Mundt, Boerne,  and others-endeavored in essays, novels, plays, and pamphlets to stir  up public interest in questions of political, social, and religious  reform.    Many passages in Heine's _Pictures of Travel_ breathe the spirit of  the Young German propaganda--the celebrated confession of faith, for  example, in the _Journey to the Hartz_, in which he declares himself a  knight of the holy spirit of iconoclastic democracy. In Paris he  actively enlisted in the cause, and for about fifteen years continued,  as a journalist, the kind of expository and polemic writing that he  had developed in the later volumes of the _Pictures of Travel_.  Regarding himself, like many an expatriate, as a mediator between the  country of his birth and the country of his adoption, he wrote for  German papers accounts of events in the political and artistic world  of France, and for French periodicals more ambitious essays on the  history of religion, philosophy, and recent literature in Germany.  Most of the works of this time were published in both French and  German, and Heine arranged also for the appearance of the _Pictures of  Travel_ and the _Book of Songs_ in French translations. To all intents  and purposes he became a Frenchman; from 1836 or 1837 until 1848 he  was the recipient of an annual pension of 4,800 francs from the French  government; he has even been suspected of having become a French  citizen. But he in no sense curbed his tongue when speaking of French  affairs, nor was he free from longing to be once more in his native  land.    In Germany, however, he was commonly regarded as a traitor; and at the  same time the Young Germans, with the more influential of whom he soon  quarreled, looked upon him as a renegade; so that there was a peculiar  inappropriateness in the notorious decree of the Bundesrat at  Frankfurt, voted December 10, 1835, and impotently forbidding the  circulation in Germany of the writings of the Young Germans: Heine,  Gutzkow, Laube, Wienbarg, and Mundt--in that order. But the occupants  of insecure thrones have a fine scent for the odor of sedition, and  Heine was an untiring sapper and miner in the modern army moving  against the strongholds of aristocrats and priests. A keen observer in  Hamburg who was resolved, though not in the manner of the Young  Germans, to do his part in furthering social reform, Friedrich Hebbel,  wrote to a friend in March, 1836: \"Our time is one in which action  destined to be decisive for a thousand years is being prepared. What  artillery did not accomplish at Leipzig must now be"]]]
