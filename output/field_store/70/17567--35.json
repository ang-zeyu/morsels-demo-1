O. Henry could   have been proud of it. It could well become a   minor classic._      The Last Supper    By T. D. Hamm      Hampered as she was by the child in her arms, the woman was running less  fleetly now. A wave of exultation swept over Guldran, drowning out the  uneasy feeling of guilt at disobeying orders.    The instructions were mandatory and concise: \"_No_ capture must be  attempted individually. In the event of sighting any form of human life,  the ship MUST be notified immediately. All small craft must be back at  the landing space not later than one hour before take-off. Anyone not so  reporting will be presumed lost.\"    Guldran thought uneasily of the great seas of snow and ice sweeping  inexorably toward each other since the Earth had reversed on its axis in  the great catastrophe a millennium ago. Now, summer and winter alike  brought paralyzing gales and blizzards, heralded by the sleety snow in  which the woman's skin-clad feet had left the tracks which led to  discovery.    His trained anthropologist's mind speculated avidly over the little they  had gotten from the younger of the two men found nearly a week before,  nearly frozen and half-starved. The older man had succumbed almost at  once; the other, in the most primitive sign language, had indicated  that, of several humans living in caves to the west, only he and the  other had survived to flee some mysterious terror. Guldran felt a throb  of pity for the woman and her child, left behind by the men, no doubt,  as a hindrance.    But what a stroke of fortune that there should be left a male and female  of the race to carry the seed of Terra to another planet. And what a  triumph if he, Guldran, should be the one to return at the eleventh hour  with the prize. No need of calling for help. This was no armed  war-party, but the most defenseless being in the Universe--a mother  burdened with a child.    Guldran put on another burst of speed. His previous shouts had served  only to spur the woman to greater efforts. Surely there was _some_ magic  word that had survived even the centuries of illiteracy. Something  equivalent to the \"bread and salt\" of all illiterate peoples. Cupping  his hands to his mouth, he shouted, \"Food! food!\"    Ahead of him the woman turned her head, leaped lightly in mid-stride,  and went on; slowing a little but still running doggedly.    Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled again, \"Food!\"    The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he  knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the  fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of  the human race had fled.    Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She  pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child.    \"Food!\" said the last woman on earth.
