[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#4)"],[1," between the west wall of the ancient Roman baths and the modern  skeleton construction of the roof of the human greenhouse there is  no attempt at fusion. The slender latticed columns cut unpleasantly  through the granite cornices and mouldings; the first century A.D. and  the twentieth are here in incongruous juxtaposition--a little thing,  easily overlooked, yet how revealing! How reassuring of the fact \"God  is not mocked!\"    The New York Central terminal speaks to the eye in a modern tongue,  with however French an accent. Its facade suggests a portal, reminding  the beholder that a railway station is in a very literal sense a city  gate placed just as appropriately in the center of the municipality as  in ancient times it was placed in the circuit of the outer walls.    Neither edifice will stand the acid test of Mr. Sullivan's formula,  that a building is an organism and should follow the law of organisms,  which decrees that the form must everywhere follow and express the  function, the function determining and creating its appropriate form.  Here are two eminent examples of \"arranged\" architecture. Before  organic architecture can come into being our inchoate national life  must itself become organic. Arranged architecture, of the sort we  see everywhere, despite its falsity, is a true expression of the  conditions which gave it birth.    [Illustration: PLATE V. THE NEW YORK CENTRAL TERMINAL]    The grandeur of Rome, the splendour of Paris--what just and adequate  expression do they give of modern American life? Then shall we find in  our great hotels, say, such expression? Truly they represent, in the  phrase of Henry James, \"a realized ideal\" and a study of them should  reveal that ideal. From such a study we can only conclude that it  is life without effort or responsibility, with every physical need  luxuriously gratified. But these hotels nevertheless represent  democracy, it may be urged, for the reason that every one may there  buy board and lodging and mercenary service if he has the price. The  exceeding greatness of that price, however, makes of it a badge  of nobility which converts these democratic hostelries into feudal  castles, more inaccessible to the Long Denied than as though entered  by a drawbridge and surrounded by a moat.    We need not even glance at the churches, for the tides of our  spiritual life flow no longer in full volume through their portals;  neither may the colleges long detain us, for architecturally  considered they give forth a confusion of tongues which has its  analogue in the confusion of ideas in the collective academic head.    Is our search for some sign of democracy ended, and is it vain? No,  democracy exists in the secret heart of the people, all the people,  but it is a thing so new, so strange, so secret and sacred--the ideal  of brotherhood--that it is unmanifest yet in time and space. It is  a thing born not with the Declaration of Independence, but only  yesterday, with the call to a new crusade. The National Army is its  cradle, and it is nurtured wherever communities unite to serve the  sacred cause. Although menaced by the bloody sword of Imperialism in  Europe, it perhaps stands in no less danger from the secret poison  of graft and greed and treachery here at home. But it is a spiritual  birth, and therefore it cannot perish, but will live to write itself  on space in terms of beauty such as the world has never known.          II    DURING THE WAR      The best thing that can be said about our immediate architectural  past is that it is past, for it has contributed little of value to an  architecture of democracy. During that neo-feudal period the architect  prospered, having his place at the baronial table; but now poor Tom's  a-cold on a war-swept heath, with food only for reflection. This  is but natural; the architect, in so far as he is an artist, is a  purveyor of beauty; and the abnormal conditions inevitable to a state  of war are devastating to so feminine and tender a thing, even though  war be the very soil from which new beauty springs. With Mars in  mid-heaven how afflicted is the horoscope of all artists! The skilled  hand of the musician is put to coarser uses; the eye that learned  its lessons from the sunset must learn the trick of making invisible  warships and great guns. Let the architect serve the war-god likewise,  in any capacity that offers, confident that this troubling of the  waters will bring about a new precipitation; that once the war is  over, men will turn from those \"old, unhappy, far-off things\" to  pastures beautiful and new.    In whatever way the war may complicate the architect's personal  problem, it should simplify and clarify his attitude toward his art.  With no matter what seriousness and sincerity he may have undertaken  his personal search for truth and beauty, he will come to question,  as never before, both its direction and its results. He is bound to  perceive, if he does not perceive already, that the war's arrestment  of architecture (in all but its most utilitarian and ephemeral phases)  is no great loss to the world for the reason that our architecture was  uninspired, unoriginal, done without joy, without reverence, without  conviction: a thing which any wind of a new spirit was bound to make  appear foolish to a generation with sight rendered clairvoyant through  its dedication to great and regenerative ends.    He will come to perceive that between the Civil War and the crusade  that is now upon us, we were under the evil spell of materialism. Now  materialism is the very negation of democracy, which is a government  by the _demos_, or over-soul; it is equally the negation of joy, the  negation of reverence, and it is without conviction because it cannot  believe even in itself. Reflecting thus, he can scarcely fail to  realize that materialism, everywhere entrenched, was entrenched  strongest in the camps of the rich---not the idle rich, for  materialism is so terrible a taskmaster that it makes its votaries its  slaves. These slaves, in turn, made a slave of the artist, a minister  to their pride and pretence. His art thus lacked that \"sad sincerity\"  which alone might have saved it in a crisis. When the storm broke  militant democracy turned to the engineer, who produced buildings at  record speed, by the mile, with only such architectural assistance as  could be first and easiest fished up from the dragnet of the draft.    In one direction only does there appear to be open water. Toward the  general housing problem the architectural profession has been spurred  into activity by reason of the war, and to its credit be it said, it  is now thoroughly aroused. The American Institute of Architects sent a  commissioner to England to study housing in its latest manifestations,  and some of the ablest and most influential members of that  organization have placed their services at the disposal of the  government. Moreover, there is a manifest disposition, on the part of  architects everywhere, to help in this matter all they can. The danger  dwells in the possibility that their advice will not be heeded, their  services not be fully utilized, but through chicanery, ignorance,  or inanition, we will relapse into the tentative, \"expensively  provisional\" methods which have governed the housing of workers  hitherto. Even so, architects will doubtless recapture, and more  than recapture, their imperiled prestige, but under what changed  conditions, and with what an altered attitude toward their art and  their craft!    They will find that they must unlearn certain things the schools had  taught them: preoccupation with the relative merits of Gothic and  Classic--tweedledum and tweedledee. Furthermore, they must learn  certain neglected lessons from the engineer, lessons that they will  be able immeasurably to better, for although the engineer is a very  monster of competence and efficiency within his limits, these are  sharply marked, and to any detailed knowledge of that \"beautiful  necessity\" which determines spatial rhythm and counterpoint he is a  stranger. The ideal relation between architect and engineer is that of  a happily wedded pair--strength married to beauty; in the period just  passed or passing they have been as disgruntled divorces.    [Illustration: PLATE VI. PLAN OF THE RED CROSS COMMUNITY CLUB HOUSE,  CAMP SHERMAN, OHIO]    The author has in mind one child of such a happy union brought about  by the war; the building is the Red Cross Community Club House at Camp  Sherman, which, in the pursuit of his destiny, and for the furtherance  of his education, he inhabited for two memorable weeks. He learned  there more lessons than a few, and encountered more tangled skeins of  destiny than he is ever likely to unravel. The matter has so direct a  bearing, both on the subject of architecture and of democracy, that it  is worth discussing at some length.    This club house stands, surrounded by its tributary dormitories, on a  government reservation, immediately adjacent to the camp itself,  the whole constituting what is known as the Community Center. By the  payment of a dollar any soldier is free to entertain his relatives  and friends there, and it is open to all the soldiers at all times.  Because the iron discipline of the army is relaxed as soon as the  limits of the camp are overpassed, the atmosphere is favourable to  social life.    The building occupies its acre of ground invitingly, though exteriorly  of no particular distinction. It is the interior that entitles it to  consideration as a contribution to an architecture of that new-born  democracy of which our army camps have been the cradle. The plan of  this interior is cruciform, two hundred feet in each dimension. Built  by the Red Cross of the state of Ohio, and dedicated to the larger  uses of that organization, the symbolic appropriateness of this  particular geometrical figure should not pass unremarked. The cross"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#4)"],[1,"and thought be not but two facets of the same  psychic process. The question is all the more difficult because it has  been hedged about by misunderstandings. In the first place, it is well  to observe that whether or not thought necessitates symbolism, that is  speech, the flow of language itself is not always indicative of thought.  We have seen that the typical linguistic element labels a concept. It  does not follow from this that the use to which language is put is  always or even mainly conceptual. We are not in ordinary life so much  concerned with concepts as such as with concrete particularities and  specific relations. When I say, for instance, \"I had a good breakfast  this morning,\" it is clear that I am not in the throes of laborious  thought, that what I have to transmit is hardly more than a pleasurable  memory symbolically rendered in the grooves of habitual expression. Each  element in the sentence defines a separate concept or conceptual  relation or both combined, but the sentence as a whole has no conceptual  significance whatever. It is somewhat as though a dynamo capable of  generating enough power to run an elevator were operated almost  exclusively to feed an electric door-bell. The parallel is more  suggestive than at first sight appears. Language may be looked upon as  an instrument capable of running a gamut of psychic uses. Its flow not  only parallels that of the inner content of consciousness, but parallels  it on different levels, ranging from the state of mind that is dominated  by particular images to that in which abstract concepts and their  relations are alone at the focus of attention and which is ordinarily  termed reasoning. Thus the outward form only of language is constant;  its inner meaning, its psychic value or intensity, varies freely with  attention or the selective interest of the mind, also, needless to say,  with the mind's general development. From the point of view of  language, thought may be defined as the highest latent or potential  content of speech, the content that is obtained by interpreting each of  the elements in the flow of language as possessed of its very fullest  conceptual value. From this it follows at once that language and thought  are not strictly coterminous. At best language can but be the outward  facet of thought on the highest, most generalized, level of symbolic  expression. To put our viewpoint somewhat differently, language is  primarily a pre-rational function. It humbly works up to the thought  that is latent in, that may eventually be read into, its classifications  and its forms; it is not, as is generally but naively assumed, the final  label put upon, the finished thought.    Most people, asked if they can think without speech, would probably  answer, \"Yes, but it is not easy for me to do so. Still I know it can be  done.\" Language is but a garment! But what if language is not so much a  garment as a prepared road or groove? It is, indeed, in the highest  degree likely that language is an instrument originally put to uses  lower than the conceptual plane and that thought arises as a refined  interpretation of its content. The product grows, in other words, with  the instrument, and thought may be no more conceivable, in its genesis  and daily practice, without speech than is mathematical reasoning  practicable without the lever of an appropriate mathematical symbolism.  No one believes that even the most difficult mathematical proposition is  inherently dependent on an arbitrary set of symbols, but it is  impossible to suppose that the human mind is capable of arriving at or  holding such a proposition without the symbolism. The writer, for one,  is strongly of the opinion that the feeling entertained by so many that  they can think, or even reason, without language is an illusion. The  illusion seems to be due to a number of factors. The simplest of these  is the failure to distinguish between imagery and thought. As a matter  of fact, no sooner do we try to put an image into conscious relation  with another than we find ourselves slipping into a silent flow of  words. Thought may be a natural domain apart from the artificial one of  speech, but speech would seem to be the only road we know of that leads  to it. A still more fruitful source of the illusive feeling that  language may be dispensed with in thought is the common failure to  realize that language is not identical with its auditory symbolism. The  auditory symbolism may be replaced, point for point, by a motor or by a  visual symbolism (many people can read, for instance, in a purely visual  sense, that is, without the intermediating link of an inner flow of the  auditory images that correspond to the printed or written words) or by  still other, more subtle and elusive, types of transfer that are not so  easy to define. Hence the contention that one thinks without language  merely because he is not aware of a coexisting auditory imagery is very  far indeed from being a valid one. One may go so far as to suspect that  the symbolic expression of thought may in some cases run along outside  the fringe of the conscious mind, so that the feeling of a free,  nonlinguistic stream of thought is for minds of a certain type a  relatively, but only a relatively, justified one. Psycho-physically,  this would mean that the auditory or equivalent visual or motor centers  in the brain, together with the appropriate paths of association, that  are the cerebral equivalent of speech, are touched off so lightly during  the process of thought as not to rise into consciousness at all. This  would be a limiting case--thought riding lightly on the submerged crests  of speech, instead of jogging along with it, hand in hand. The modern  psychology has shown us how powerfully symbolism is at work in the  unconscious mind. It is therefore easier to understand at the present  time than it would have been twenty years ago that the most rarefied  thought may be but the conscious counterpart of an unconscious  linguistic symbolism.    One word more as to the relation between language and thought. The point  of view that we have developed does not by any means preclude the  possibility of the growth of speech being in a high degree dependent on  the development of thought. We may assume that language arose  pre-rationally--just how and on what precise level of mental activity we  do not know--but we must not imagine that a highly developed system of  speech symbols worked itself out before the genesis of distinct concepts  and of thinking, the handling of concepts. We must rather imagine that  thought processes set in, as a kind of psychic overflow, almost at the  beginning of linguistic expression; further, that the concept, once  defined, necessarily reacted on the life of its linguistic symbol,  encouraging further linguistic growth. We see this complex process of  the interaction of language and thought actually taking place under our  eyes. The instrument makes possible the product, the product refines the  instrument. The birth of a new concept is invariably foreshadowed by a  more or less strained or extended use of old linguistic material; the  concept does not attain to individual and independent life until it has  found a distinctive linguistic embodiment. In most cases the new symbol  is but a thing wrought from linguistic material already in existence in  ways mapped out by crushingly despotic precedents. As soon as the word  is at hand, we instinctively feel, with something of a sigh of relief,  that the concept is ours for the handling. Not until we own the symbol  do we feel that we hold a key to the immediate knowledge or  understanding of the concept. Would we be so ready to die for \"liberty,\"  to struggle for \"ideals,\" if the words themselves were not ringing  within us? And the word, as we know, is not only a key; it may also be a  fetter.    Language is primarily an auditory system of symbols. In so far as it is  articulated it is also a motor system, but the motor aspect of speech is  clearly secondary to the auditory. In normal individuals the impulse to  speech first takes effect in the sphere of auditory imagery and is then  transmitted to the motor nerves that control the organs of speech. The  motor processes and the accompanying motor feelings are not, however,  the end, the final resting point. They are merely a means and a control  leading to auditory perception in both speaker and hearer.  Communication, which is the very object of speech, is successfully  effected only when the hearer's auditory perceptions are translated into  the appropriate and intended flow of imagery or thought or both  combined. Hence the cycle of speech, in so far as we may look upon it as  a purely external instrument, begins and ends in the realm of sounds.  The concordance between the initial auditory imagery and the final  auditory perceptions is the social seal or warrant of the successful  issue of the process. As we have already seen, the typical course of  this process may undergo endless modifications or transfers into  equivalent systems without thereby losing its essential formal  characteristics.    The most important of these modifications is the abbreviation of the  speech process involved in thinking. This has doubtless many forms,  according to the structural or functional peculiarities of the  individual mind. The least modified form is that known as \"talking to  one's self\" or \"thinking aloud.\" Here the speaker and the hearer are  identified in a single person, who may be said to communicate with  himself. More significant is the still further abbreviated form in which  the sounds of speech are not articulated at all. To this belong all the  varieties of silent speech and of normal thinking. The auditory centers  alone may be excited; or the impulse to linguistic expression may be  communicated as well to the motor nerves that communicate with the  organs of speech but "]]]
