It was easy to  read upon the magistrate's astounded countenance, that there was not the  slightest similarity in the two handwritings.    \"A fresh mystery had cropped up. Who, then, had made the assignation  with William Kershaw at Fenchurch Street railway station? The prisoner  gave a fairly satisfactory account of the employment of his time since  his landing in England.    \"'I came over on the _Tsarskoe Selo_,' he said, 'a yacht belonging to a  friend of mine. When we arrived at the mouth of the Thames there was  such a dense fog that it was twenty-four hours before it was thought  safe for me to land. My friend, who is a Russian, would not land at all;  he was regularly frightened at this land of fogs. He was going on to  Madeira immediately.    \"'I actually landed on Tuesday, the 10th, and took a train at once for  town. I did see to my luggage and a cab, as the porter and driver told  your Honour; then I tried to find my way to a refreshment-room, where I  could get a glass of wine. I drifted into the waiting-room, and there I  was accosted by a shabbily dressed individual, who began telling me a  piteous tale. Who he was I do not know. He _said_ he was an old soldier  who had served his country faithfully, and then been left to starve. He  begged of me to accompany him to his lodgings, where I could see his  wife and starving children, and verify the truth and piteousness of his  tale.    \"'Well, your Honour,' added the prisoner with noble frankness, 'it was  my first day in the old country. I had come back after thirty years with  my pockets full of gold, and this was the first sad tale I had heard;  but I am a business man, and did not want to be exactly \"done\" in the  eye. I followed my man through the fog, out into the streets. He walked  silently by my side for a time. I had not a notion where I was.    \"'Suddenly I turned to him with some question, and realized in a moment  that my gentleman had given me the slip. Finding, probably, that I would  not part with my money till I _had_ seen the starving wife and children,  he left me to my fate, and went in search of more willing bait.    \"'The place where I found myself was dismal and deserted. I could see no  trace of cab or omnibus. I retraced my steps and tried to find my way  back to the station, only to find myself in worse and more deserted  neighbourhoods. I became hopelessly lost and fogged. I don't wonder that  two and a half hours elapsed while I thus wandered on in the dark and  deserted streets; my sole astonishment is that I ever found the station  at all that night, or rather close to it a policeman, who showed me the  way.'    \"'But how do you account for Kershaw knowing all your movements?' still  persisted his Honour, 'and his knowing the exact date of your arrival  in England? How do you account for these two letters, in fact?'    \"'I cannot account for it or them, your Honour,' replied the prisoner  quietly. 'I have proved to you, have I not, that I never wrote those  letters, and that the man--er--Kershaw is his name?--was not murdered by  me?'    \"'Can you tell me of anyone here or abroad who might have heard of your  movements, and of the date of your arrival?'    \"'My late employes at Vladivostok, of course, knew of my departure, but  none of them could have written these letters, since none of them know a  word of English.'    \"'Then you can throw no light upon these mysterious letters? You cannot  help the police in any way towards the clearing up of this strange  affair?'    \"'The affair is as mysterious to me as to your Honour, and to the police  of this country.'    \"Francis Smethurst was discharged, of course; there was no semblance of  evidence against him sufficient to commit him for trial. The two  overwhelming points of his defence which had completely routed the  prosecution were, firstly, the proof that he had never written the  letters making the assignation, and secondly, the fact that the man  supposed to have been murdered on the 10th was seen to be alive and  well on the 16th. But then, who in the world was the mysterious  individual who had apprised Kershaw of the movements of Smethurst, the  millionaire?\"          CHAPTER III    HIS DEDUCTION      The man in the corner cocked his funny thin head on one side and looked  at Polly; then he took up his beloved bit of string and deliberately  untied every knot he had made in it. When it was quite smooth he laid it  out upon the table.    \"I will take you, if you like, point by point along the line of  reasoning which I followed myself, and which will inevitably lead you,  as it led me, to the only possible solution of the mystery.    \"First take this point,\" he said with nervous restlessness, once more  taking up his bit of string, and forming with each point raised a series  of knots which would have shamed a navigating instructor, \"obviously it  was _impossible_ for Kershaw not to have been acquainted with Smethurst,  since he was fully apprised of the latter's arrival in England by two  letters. Now it was clear to me from the first that _no one_ could have  written those two letters except Smethurst. You will argue that those  letters were proved not to have been written by the man in the dock.  Exactly. Remember, Kershaw was a careless man--he had lost both  envelopes. To him they were insignificant. Now it was never _disproved_  that those letters were written by Smethurst.\"    \"But--\" suggested Polly.    \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted, while knot number two appeared upon the  scene, \"it was proved that six days after the murder, William Kershaw  was alive, and visited the Torriani Hotel, where already he was known,  and where he conveniently left a pocket-book behind, so that there  should be no mistake as to his identity; but it was never questioned  where Mr. Francis Smethurst, the millionaire, happened to spend that  very same afternoon.\"    \"Surely, you don't mean?\" gasped the girl.    \"One moment, please,\" he added triumphantly. \"How did it come about that  the landlord of the Torriani Hotel was brought into court at all? How  did Sir Arthur Inglewood, or rather his client, know that William  Kershaw had on those two memorable occasions visited the hotel, and that  its landlord could bring such convincing evidence forward that would for  ever exonerate the millionaire from the imputation of murder?\"    \"Surely,\" I argued, \"the usual means, the police--\"    \"The police had kept the whole affair very dark until the arrest at the  Hotel Cecil. They did not put into the papers the usual: 'If anyone  happens to know of the whereabouts, etc. etc'. Had the landlord of that  hotel heard of the disappearance of Kershaw through the usual channels,  he would have put himself in communication with the police. Sir Arthur  Inglewood produced him. How did Sir Arthur Inglewood come on his track?\"    \"Surely, you don't mean?\"    \"Point number four,\" he resumed imperturbably, \"Mrs. Kershaw was never  requested to produce a specimen of her husband's handwriting. Why?  Because the police, clever as you say they are, never started on the  right tack. They believed William Kershaw to have been murdered; they  looked for William Kershaw.    \"On December the 31st, what was presumed to be the body of William  Kershaw was found by two lightermen: I have shown you a photograph of  the place where it was found. Dark and deserted it is in all conscience,  is it not? Just the place where a bully and a coward would decoy an  unsuspecting stranger, murder him first, then rob him of his valuables,  his papers, his very identity, and leave him there to rot. The body was  found in a disused barge which had been moored some time against the  wall, at the foot of these steps. It was in the last stages of  decomposition, and, of course, could not be identified; but the police  would have it that it was the body of William Kershaw.    \"It never entered their heads that it was the body of _Francis  Smethurst, and that William Kershaw was his murderer_.    \"Ah! it was cleverly, artistically conceived! Kershaw is a genius. Think  of it all! His disguise! Kershaw had a shaggy beard, hair, and  moustache. He shaved up to his very eyebrows! No wonder that even his  wife did not recognize him across the court; and remember she never saw  much of his face while he stood in the dock. Kershaw was shabby,  slouchy, he stooped. Smethurst, the millionaire, might have served in  the Prussian army.    \"Then that lovely trait about going to revisit the Torriani Hotel. Just  a few days' grace, in order to purchase moustache and beard and wig,  exactly similar to what he had himself shaved off. Making up to look  like himself! Splendid! Then leaving the pocket-book behind! He! he! he!  Kershaw was not murdered! Of course not. He called at the Torriani Hotel  six days after the murder, whilst Mr. Smethurst, the millionaire,  hobnobbed in the park with duchesses! Hang such a man! Fie!\"    He fumbled for his hat. With nervous, trembling fingers he held it  deferentially in his hand whilst he rose from the table. Polly watched  him as he strode up to the desk, and paid twopence for his glass of milk  and his bun. Soon he disappeared through the shop, whilst she still  found herself hopelessly bewildered, with a number of snap-shot  photographs before her, still staring at a long piece of string,  smothered from end to end in a series of knots, as bewildering, as  irritating, as puzzling as the man who had lately sat in the corner.          CHAPTER IV    THE ROBBERY IN PHILLIMORE TERRACE      Whether Miss Polly Burton really did expect to see the man in the corner  that Saturday afternoon, 'twere difficult to say; certain it is that  when she found her way to the table close by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#4)"],[1," other men.  It never was the meaning of his raillery  to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it seldom failed to  please and delight even those who were the objects of it.  To his  friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps  one of all his great and amiable qualities which contributed more to  endear his conversation.  And that gaiety of temper, so agreeable in  society, but which is so often accompanied with frivolous and  superficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the most  severe application, the most extensive learning, the greatest depth of  thought, and a capacity in every respect the most comprehensive.  Upon  the whole, I have always considered him, both in his lifetime and  since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly  wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will  permit.

THE BRITONS.--ROMANS.--SAXONS.--THE HEPTARCHY.--THE KINGDOM OF KENT--  OF NORTHUMBERLAND--OF EAST ANGLIA--OF MERCIA--OF ESSEX--OF SUSSEX--OF  WESSEX        [MN The Britons.]  The curiosity, entertained by all civilized nations, of inquiring into  the exploits and adventures of their ancestors, commonly excites a  regret that the history of remote ages should always be so much  involved in obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction.  Ingenious men,  possessed of leisure, are apt to push their researches beyond the  period in which literary monuments are framed or preserved; without  reflecting that the history of past events is immediately lost or  disfigured when intrusted to memory or oral tradition; and that the  adventures of barbarous nations, even if they were recorded, could  afford little or no entertainment to men born in a more cultivated  age.  The convulsions of a civilized state usually compose the most  instructive and most interesting part of its history; but the sudden,  violent, and unprepared revolutions incident to barbarians are so much  guided by caprice, and terminate so often in cruelty, that they  disgust us by the uniformity of their appearance; and it is rather  fortunate for letters that they are buried in silence and oblivion.  The only certain means by which nations can indulge their curiosity in  researches concerning their  remote origin, is to consider the  language, manners, and customs of their ancestors, and to compare them  with those of the neighbouring nations.  The fables which are commonly  employed to supply the place of true history ought entirely to be  disregarded; or if any exception be admitted to this general rule, it  can only be in favour of the ancient Grecian fictions, which are so  celebrated and so agreeable, that they will ever be the objects of the  attention of mankind.  Neglecting, therefore, all traditions, or  rather tales, concerning the more early history of Britain, we shall  only consider the state of the inhabitants as it appeared to the  Romans on their invasion of this country: we shall briefly run over  the events which attended the conquest made by that empire, as  belonging more to Roman than British story: we shall hasten through  the obscure and uninteresting period of Saxon annals: and shall  reserve a more full narration for those times when the truth is both  so well ascertained and so complete as to promise entertainment and  instruction to the reader.    All ancient writers agree in representing the first inhabitants of  Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae, who peopled that island  from the neighbouring continent.  Their language was the same; their  manners, their government, their superstition, varied only by those  small differences which time or communication with the bordering  nations must necessarily introduce.  The inhabitants of Gaul,  especially in those parts which lie contiguous to Italy, had acquired,  from a commerce with their southern neighbours, some refinement in the  arts, which gradually diffused themselves northwards, and spread but a  very faint light over this island.  The Greek and Roman navigators or  merchants (for there were scarcely any other travellers in those ages)  brought back the most shocking accounts of the ferocity of the people,  which they magnified, as usual, in order to excite the admiration of  their countrymen.  The south-east parts, however, of Britain had  already, before the age of Caesar, made the first, and most requisite  step towards a civil settlement; and the Britons, by tillage and  agriculture, had there increased to a great multitude [a].  The other  inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves by pasture:  they were clothed with skins of beasts. They dwelt in huts, which they  reared in the forests and marshes, with which the country "]]]
