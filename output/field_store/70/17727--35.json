This was the army with which I was to traverse unexplored regions  peopled, as far as we knew, by hostile tribes. But I could depend upon a  great portion of the men, and amongst them were some who had been with me  on the two former expeditions and who, although they had obtained their  emancipation as the well merited reward of their past services in the  interior, were nevertheless willing to accompany me once more. I accepted  their services on obtaining a promise from the governor that if the  expedition was successful their conditional pardons might be converted  into absolute pardons, a boon on which even some wealthy men in the  colony would probably have set a high value.    One of the most devoted of these followers was William Woods who, having  long toiled carrying my theodolite to the summits of the highest  mountains, was at length more comfortably situated than he had ever been  in his life before as overseer of a road party. This poor fellow  relinquished his place of authority over other men and in which he  received 1 shilling per diem, again put on the grey jacket, and set a  valuable example as the most willing of my followers, wherever drudgery  or difficulty were most discouraging.    LIVESTOCK.    Our cattle were lean but I took a greater number in consequence. The  pasturage was still meagre and scarcely any water remained on the face of  the earth. It was unusually low in the holes last year, but this season  very few indeed contained any. The equinox however was at hand, and I  could not suppose that it was never to rain again, however hopeless the  aspect of the country appeared at that time.    AGREEMENT WITH A NATIVE GUIDE.    In this camp of preparation I was visited by our old friends the natives;  and one who called himself John Piper and spoke English tolerably well  agreed to accompany me as far as I should go, provided he was allowed a  horse and was clothed, fed, etc.; all which I immediately agreed to. I  had not however forgotten Mr. Brown, and I reminded Burnett of that  native's desertion; but Burnett, who seemed to be on excellent terms with  Piper, assured me that after he should be some weeks' journey in the  interior dread of the savage natives would prevent him from leaving our  party, and so it turned out.    But in breaking on our stock of provisions, we commenced with due regard  to their importance on an interior journey by so reducing the weight of  our steel-yard that a five months' stock should last nearly seven months.  This arrangement was however a secret known only to Burnett and myself.    The plan of encampment was to be the same as on the former journey, only  that a greater number of carts stood in the line parallel to the  boat-carriage.    March 17.    I put the party in movement towards Buree and rode across the country on  our right with Piper. We found the earth parched and bare but, as we  bounded over hill and dale a fine cool breeze whispered through the open  forest, and felt most refreshing after the hot winds of Sydney. Dr.  Johnson's Obidah was not more free from care on the morning of his  journey than I was on this, the first morning of mine. It was also St.  Patrick's day, and in riding through the bush I had leisure to recall  past scenes and times connected with the anniversary. I remembered that  exactly on that morning, twenty-four years before, I marched down the  glacis of Elvas to the tune of St. Patrick's Day in the Morning as the  sun rose over the beleaguered towers of Badajoz. Now, without any of the  pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war, I was proceeding on a  service not very likely to be peaceful, for the natives here assured me  that the Myalls were coming up murry coola, i.e. very angry, to meet us.  At Buree I rejoined my friend Rankin who had accompanied me from Bathurst  to the camp, and Captain Raine who occupied this place with his cattle. A  hundred sheep and five fat oxen were to be furnished by this gentlemen to  complete my commissariat supplies.    CORROBORY-DANCE OF THE NATIVES.    In the evening the blacks, having assembled in some numbers, entertained  us with a corrobory, their universal and highly original dance. (See  Plate.) Like all the rest of the habits and customs of this singular race  of wild men, the corrobory is peculiar and, from its uniformity on every  shore, a very striking feature in their character. The dance always takes  place at night, by the light of blazing boughs, and to time beaten on  stretched skins, accompanied by a song.* The dancers paint themselves  white, and in such remarkably varied ways that no two individuals are at  all alike. Darkness seems essential to the effect of the whole; and the  painted figures coming forward in mystic order from the obscurity of the  background, while the singers and beaters of time are invisible, have a  highly theatrical effect. Each dance seems most tastefully progressive;  the movement being at first slow, and introduced by two persons  displaying graceful motions both of arms and legs, others one by one join  in, each imperceptibly warming into the truly savage attitude of the  corrobory jump; the legs then stride to the utmost, the head is turned  over one shoulder, the eyes glare and are fixed with savage energy all in  one direction, the arms also are raised and inclined towards the head,  the hands usually grasping waddies, boomerangs, or other warlike weapons.  The jump now keeps time with each beat, the dancers at every movement  taking six inches to one side, all being in a connected line, led by the  first. The line however is sometimes doubled or tripled according to  space and numbers; and this gives great effect, for when the front line  jumps to the LEFT, the second jumps to the RIGHT, the third to the LEFT  again, and so on; until the action acquires due intensity, when all  simultaneously and suddenly stop. The excitement which this dance  produces in the savage is very remarkable. However listless the  individual may be, laying perhaps, as usual, half asleep; set him to this  dance, and he is fired with sudden energy, and every nerve is strung to  such a degree that he is no longer to be recognised as the same person  until he ceases to dance, and comes to you again. There can be little  doubt that the corrobory is the medium through which the delights of  poetry are enjoyed, in a limited degree, even by these primitive savages  of New Holland.    (*Footnote. To this end they stretch a skin very tight over the knees,  and thus may be said to use the tympanum in its rudest form, this being  the only instance of a musical instrument that I have seen among them.  Burder says: \"By the timbrels which Miriam and the other women played  upon when dancing, we are to understand the tympanum of the ancient  Greeks and Romans, which instrument still bears in the East the name that  it is in Hebrew, namely, doff or diff, whence is derived the Spanish  adufe, the name of the Biscayan tabor. Niebuhr describes this instrument  in his Travels Part 1 page 181. It is a broad hoop, with a skin stretched  over it; on the edge there are generally thin round plates of metal,  which also make some noise when this instrument is held up in one hand  and struck with the fingers of the other hand. Probably no musical  instrument is so common in Turkey as this; for when the women dance in  the harem the time is always beat on this instrument. We find the same  instrument on all the monuments in the hands of the Bacchante. It is also  common among the negroes of the Gold Coast and Slave Coast.\" Oriental  Customs Volume 1.)    VISIT TO THE LIMESTONE CAVES.    March 18.    As it was necessary to grind some wheat with hand-mills to make up our  supply of flour, I was obliged to remain a day at Buree; and I therefore  determined on a visit to the limestone caves, by no means the least  remarkable feature in that country. The whole district consists of trap  and limestone, the former appearing in ridges, which belong to the lofty  mass of Canobolas. The limestone occurs chiefly in the sides of valleys  in different places, and contains probably many unexplored caves. The  orifices are small fissures in the rock, and they have escaped the  attention of the white people who have hitherto wandered there. I had  long been anxious to extend my researches for fossil bones among these  caves, having discovered during a cursory visit to them some years before  that many interesting remains of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#4)"],[1,"by that court or the Empress Catherine to collect  Parisian anecdotes, neither had he then been made a baron, but was  merely civil secretary of Count von Friese. Both J.J. Rousseau and  Buffon belonged at first to these societies; but the former, in great  alarm, broke off all intercourse with the people who then played the  first parts in Paris, and the other quietly retired.

Mr. Hawthorne must be well  known to our readers as a favorite of the _Athenaeum_. We rate him  as among the most original and peculiar writers of American fiction.  There in his works a mixture of Puritan reserve and wild imagination,  of passion and description, of the allegorical and the real, which  some will fail to understand, and which others will positively  reject,--but which, to ourselves, is fascinating, and which entitles  him to be placed on a level with Brockden Brown and the author of 'Rip  Van Winkle.' 'The Scarlet Letter' will increase his reputation with  all who do not shrink from the invention of the tale; but this, as  we have said, is more than ordinarily painful. When we have announced  that the three characters are a guilty wife, openly punished for her  guilt,--her tempter, whom she refuses to unmask, and who during the  entire story carries a fair front and an unblemished name among his  congregation,--and her husband, who, returning from a long absence at  the moment of her sentence, sits himself down betwixt the two in the  midst of a small and severe community to work out his slow vengeance  on both under the pretext of magnanimous forgiveness,--when we have  explained that 'The Scarlet Letter' is the badge of Hester Prynne's  shame, we ought to add that we recollect no tale dealing with crime  so sad and revenge so subtly diabolical, that is at the same time so  clear of fever and of prurient excitement. The misery of the woman  is as present in every page as the heading which in the title of  the romance symbolizes her punishment. Her terrors concerning her  strange elvish child present retribution in a form which is new and  natural:--her slow and painful purification through repentance is  crowned by no perfect happiness, such as awaits the decline of those  who have no dark and bitter past to remember. Then, the gradual  corrosion of heart of Dimmesdale, the faithless priest, under the  insidious care of the husband, (whose relationship to Hester is  a secret known only to themselves,) is appalling; and his final  confession and expiation are merely a relief, not a reconciliation.  We are by no means satisfied that passions and tragedies like these  are the legitimate subjects for fiction: we are satisfied that  novels such as 'Adam Blair,' and plays such as 'The Stranger,' maybe  justly charged with attracting more persons than they warn by their  excitement. But if Sin and Sorrow in their most fearful forms are to  be presented in any work of art, they have rarely been treated with  a loftier severity, purity, and sympathy than in Mr. Hawthorne's  'Scarlet Letter.' The touch of the fantastic befitting a period of  society in which ignorant and excitable human creatures conceived each  other and themselves to be under the direct 'rule and governance' of  the Wicked One, is most skillfully administered. The supernatural here  never becomes grossly palpable:--the thrill is all the deeper for its  action being indefinite, and its source vague and distant.\"    [Footnote 2: The Scarlet Letter: a Romance. By Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Boston: Ticknor & Co.]           *       *       *       *       *    The Emperor Nicholas has just published an ordonnance, which regulates  the pensions to which Russian and foreign actors at the imperial  theaters at St. Petersburgh shall be entitled. This ordonnance divides  the actors (national as well as foreign) into four classes. The first  class obtains, after twenty years' service, pensions averaging from  300 to 1140 silver rubles. The others, after fifteen years' service,  will receive pensions from 285 to 750 silver rubles.           *       *       *       *       *    THE HAIR    CHEMICALLY AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED.--Each hair is a tube,  containing an oil, of a color similar to its own. Hair contains  at least ten distinct substances: sulphate of lime and magnesia,  chlorides of sodium and potassium, phosphate of lime, peroxide of  iron, silica, lactate of ammonia, oxide of manganese and margaim.  Of these, _sulphur_ is the most prominent, and it is upon this that  certain metallic salts operate in changing the color of hair. Thus  when the salts of lead or of mercury are applied, they enter into  combination with the sulphur, and a black sulphuret of the metal is  formed. A common formula for a paste to dye the hair, is a mixture of  litharge, slacked lime, and bicarbonate of potash. Different shades  may be given by altering the proportions of these articles. Black  hair contains iron and manganese and no magnesia; while fair hair is  destitute of the two first substances, but possesses magnesia.    No one ever possessed all the requisites of masculine or feminine  beauty without a profusion of hair. This is one of the crowning  perfections of the human form, upon which poets of all ages have dwelt  with the most untiring satisfaction. However perfect a woman may be  in other respects; however beautiful her eyes, her mouth, teeth, lips,  nose or cheeks; however brilliant her expression, in conversation or  excitement, she is positively disagreeable without this ornament of  nature. The question is sometimes asked, \"What will cure love?\" We  answer, scissors. Let the object be shorn of hair, and you may take  the word of a physiologist, that the tender passion will lose its  distinctiveness; it may subside into respect: it is more likely to  change into a less agreeable emotion.    In man, the hair is an excellent index of character. As the beard  distinguishes man from woman, so its full and luxuriant growth often  indicates strength and nobleness, intellectual and physical; while  a meager beard suggests an uncertain character--part masculine, part  feminine. Was there ever a truly great man, or one with a generous  disposition, with a thin beard and a weazen face? On the other  hand, show me a man with \"royal locks,\" and I will trust his natural  impulses in almost every vicissitude. When we see a genuine man, upon  whom Nature has declined to set this seal of her approval, we cannot  help an involuntary emotion of admiration for the virtuous and  persevering energy with which he must have overcome his destiny.    Pertinent hereto: we have read with unusual satisfaction the arguments  for Beards in Dr. Marcy's _Theory and Practice of Medicine_ and the  pleasant essays in the same behalf which John Waters has printed in  the _Knickerbocker_. Our conservatism yields before these reformers,  who would bring custom to the proprieties of nature.           *       *       *       *       *    WHAT'S IN A NAME?--A good deal, sometimes. Thus, the truth of the  adage of \"give a dog a bad name,\" &c., has lately been exemplified in  a singular manner. Eugene Sue, you may remember, causes some of the  most terrible events in the _Mysteres de Paris_ to occur in the Allee  des Venves, a fine avenue in the Champs Elysees. This has had the  effect of giving the unfortunate Allee--though as quiet, modest,  well-behaved, moral street as need be--a detestable reputation; people  have shunned it as if it were a cavern of cutthroats--those condemned  to live in it have felt themselves _quasi_-infamous--its rents have  fallen, its shops stood empty, its business has dwindled away.  The owners of its houses, and its few remaining inhabitants and  shopkeepers, have for months past been pestering the municipality of  Paris to devise means of restoring its fallen prosperity, and removing  the monstrous stigma attached to it. At last, moved by compassion, the  municipality has given permission to have the name changed to \"Avenue  de Montaigne.\" The ex-Allee, says the writer who informs us of the  circumstance, is in great jubilation, and is crying with enthusiasm  \"_Je suis sauvee!_\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"NAMES HIGH INSCRIBED.\"--It is stated that the names of nearly every  distinguished man in every department of literature and science, from  the remotest antiquity down to the present time, are inscribed in  letters of gold on the outside of the new _Bibliotheque de Sainte  Genevieve_, which is now rapidly approaching completion. The list is  naturally one of tremendous length, and covers not less than three  whole sides of the vast building. It is impossible not to admire the  spirit in which it has been devised, and the impartiality with which  it has been executed. Altogether, it does the highest credit to the  Parisians, and especially to their municipal authorities. The names  are arranged in chronological order, but without date, and without  regard to the nationality of, or to the peculiar distinction achieved  by the individual; thus the two last names are those of Berzelius, the  Swedish _savant_, and Chateaubriand; and a little above them figures  Walter Scott, Byron, and other English immortals. Living celebrities  are of course excluded.           *       *       *       *       *    MR.
