CHAPTER TWO.    THE CANON'S PEARS,    When the little girls had left him, Napoleon remained for some moments  standing in the mouth of his grotto. His hands were clasped behind his  back, his head was bent, his eyes were fixed upon the sea.    This, as I have told you, was a favorite attitude of the little boy,  copied from his uncle the canon; it remained his favorite attitude  through life, as almost any picture of this remarkable man will convince  you.    The boy was always thoughtful. But this day he was especially so. For he  knew that it was his birthday; and while not so much notice was taken of  children's birthdays when Napoleon was a boy as is now the custom, still  a birthday _was_ a birthday.    So the day set the little fellow to thinking; and, young as he was, he  had yet much to remember.    He felt that he ought to be as rich and important as the other boys  whom he knew round about Ajaccio There were Andrew Pozzo and Charles  Abbatucci, for example. They had everything they wished, their fathers  were rich and powerful; and they made fun of him, calling him \"little  frowsy head,\" and \"down at the heel,\" just because his mother could not  always look after his clothes, and keep him neat and clean.    Napoleon could not see why they should be better off than was he. His  father, Charles Bonaparte, was, he had heard them say at home, a count,  but of what good was it to be a count, or a duke, if one had not palaces  and treasure to show for it?    Napoleon knew that the big and bare four-story house in which he lived  was by no means a palace; and so far from having any treasures to spend,  he knew, instead, that if it were not for the help of their uncle, the  Canon Lucien, they would often go hungry in the big house on the little  park.    But there was one consolation. If he was badly off, so, too, were many  other boys and girls in that Mediterranean island. For when Napoleon  Bonaparte was a boy, there was much trouble in Corsica. That rocky,  sea-washed, forest-crowned island of mountains and valleys, queer  customs and brave people, had been in rebellion, against its  masters--first, the republic of Genoa, and then against France.    [Illustration: House In Which Napoleon Was Born]    [Illustration: The Mother of Napoleon]    [Illustration: The Father of Napoleon]    [Illustration: Room In Which Napoleon Was Born]    Napoleon's father, Charles Bonaparte, had been a Corsican politician and  patriot, a follower of the great Corsican leader, Paoli, who had spent  many years of a glorious life in trying to lead his fellow-Corsicans to  liberty and self-government. But the attempt had been a failure; and  three months before the baby Napoleon was born, Charles Bonaparte had,  with other Corsican leaders, given up the struggle. He submitted to the  French power, took the oath of allegiance, and became a French citizen.  And thus it came to pass that little Napoleon Bonaparte, though an  Italian by blood and family, was really by birth a French citizen.    Still, all that did not help him much, if, indeed, he thought anything  about it as he stood in his grotto looking out to sea. He was thinking  of other things,--of how he would like to be great and strong and rich,  so that he could be a leader of other boys, rather than be teased by  them; for little Napoleon Bonaparte did not take kindly to being teased,  but would get very angry at his tormentors, and would bite and scratch  and fight like any little savage. He had, as a child, what is known as  an ungovernable temper, although he was able to keep it under control  until the moment came when he could both say and do to his own  satisfaction. He loved his father and mother; he loved his brothers and  sisters; he loved his uncle, the Canon Lucien; he loved, more than all  his other playmates and companions, his boy-uncle, fat, twelve-year-old  Joey Fesch, who had taught him his letters, and been his admirer and  follower from babyhood.    But though he loved them all, he loved his own way best; and he was  bound to have it, however much his father might talk, his mother chide,  or his uncle the canon correct him. So, as he stood in the grotto,  remembering that on that day he was seven years old, he determined to  let all his family see that he knew what he wished to become and do.  He would show them, he declared, that he was a little boy, a baby, no  longer; they should know that he was a boy who would be a man long  before other boys grew up, and would then show his family that they had  never really understood him.    At last he turned away and walked slowly toward home. The Bonaparte  house was, as I have told you, a big, bare, four-story, yellow-gray  house. It stood on a little narrow street, now called, after Napoleon's  mother, Letitia Place, in the town of Ajaccio. The street was not over  eight or ten feet wide; but opposite to the house was a little park that  allowed the Bonapartes to get both light and air--something that would  otherwise be hard to obtain in a street only ten feet wide.    Tired and thirsty from his walk through the sunshine of the hot August  afternoon, the boy started for the dining-room for a drink of water. As  he opened the door in his quick, impetuous way, he heard a noise as of  some one startled and fleeing. The swinging sash of the long French  window opposite him shut with a bang, and Napoleon had a glimpse of a  bit of white skirt, caught for an instant on the window-fastening.    \"Ah, ha! it was not a bird, then, that fluttering,\" he said. \"It was a  girl. One of my sisters. Now, which one, I wonder? and why did she run?  I do not care to catch her. It is no sport playing with girls.\"    So little curiosity did he have in the matter, that he did not follow on  the track of the fugitive, nor even go to the window to look out; but,  walking up to the sideboard, he opened it to take the water-pitcher and  get a drink.    As he did so, he started. There stood the basket of fruit which Saveria  had filled so carefully with fruit for his uncle the canon. But now the  basket was only half filled. Who had taken the fruit?    He clapped his hands together in surprise; for the fruit of his uncle  the canon was something no one in the house dared to touch. Punishment  swift and sure would descend upon the culprit.    \"But, look!\" he said half-aloud; \"who has dared to touch the fruit of  my uncle the canon? Touch it? My faith! they have taken half of it. Ah,  that skirt! Could it have been--it must have been one of my sisters. But  which one?\"    As he stood thus wondering, his eyes still fixed upon the rifled basket  of fruit, he heard behind him a voice that tried to be harsh and stern,  calling his name.    \"Napoleon!\" cried the new-comer, \"what are you doing at the sideboard?  and why have you opened it? You know we have forbidden you to take  anything to eat before mealtime. What have you done?\"    It was the voice of his uncle, the Canon Lucien. Napoleon, turning at  the question, met the glance of his uncle fastened upon him. The Canon  Lucien Bonaparte was a funny looking, fat little man, as bald as he  was good-natured,--and that was _very_ bald,--and with a smooth,  ordinary-appearing face, only remarkable for the same sharp, eagle-like  look that marked his nephew Napoleon when he, too, became a man.    Napoleon looked at his uncle the canon with indignation and denial on  his face. \"Why, my uncle, I have taken nothing!\" he declared.    Then suddenly he remembered how he had been discovered by his uncle  standing before the half-emptied basket of fruit. Could it be that the  old gentleman suspected him of pilfering? Would he dare accuse him of  the crime?    At the thought his face flushed red and hot. For you must know, boys and  girls, that sometimes the fear of being suspected of a misdeed, even  when one is absolutely innocent, brings to the face the flush that is  considered a sign of guilt, and thus people are misunderstood and  wrongfully accused. When one is high-spirited this is more liable to  occur. It was so, at this moment, with the little Napoleon. His confused  air, his flushed face, even his look of indignant denial, joined as  evidence against him so strongly that his uncle the canon said sharply,  \"Come, you, Napoleon! do not lie to me now.\"    At that remark all the boy's pride was on fire.    [Illustration: \"'I never lie uncle, you know I never lie!' said  Napoleon\"]    \"I never lie, uncle; you know I never lie!\" he cried hotly.    But Uncle Lucien was so certain of the boy's guilt that he mistook his  pride for impudence. And yet he was such a good-natured old fellow, and  loved his nieces and nephews so dearly, that he tried to soften and  belittle the theft of his precious fruit.    \"No harm is done,\" he said, \"if you but tell me what you have done. The  fruit can be replaced, and I will say nothing, though you know you are  forbidden to meddle with my fruit. But I do not love to see you doing  wrong. I will not tolerate a lie. I do not know just what you have done;  but if you will tell me the truth, I will--of course I will--pardon you.  Why did you take my fruit?\"    \"I took nothing, uncle,\" the boy declared. \"It was\"--then he stopped.  Suppose it had been taken by one of his sisters, or by Panoria, their  guest? The flutter of the departing skirt, as he came into the room,  assured him it was one of these. But which one? And why should he accuse  the little girls? It was not manly, and he wished to be a man.    More than this, he was angry to think that he had been suspected,  more angry yet to think he had been accused by good Uncle Lucien, and  furiously angry to think that his word was doubted; so he said nothing  further.    \"Ah, so! It was--you, then,\" the canon said, shaking his head in  sorrowful belief.    \"No; I did"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#3)"],[1,"that Tom Swift had taken  the money, and when asked how he knew this, he said he had seen Tom  hanging around the bank the night before the vault was burst open, and  that the young inventor had some burglar tools in his possession.  Warrants were at once sworn out for Tom and Mr. Damon, who was also  accused of being one of the robbers, and a reward of five thousand  dollars was offered.    Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp sailed on, all unaware of this, and unable  to account for being fired upon, until they accidentally read in the  paper an account of their supposed misdeeds. They lost no time in  starting back home, and on the way got on the track of the real bank  robbers, who were members of the Happy Harry gang.    How the robbers were captured in an exciting raid, how Tom recovered  most of the stolen money, and how he gave Andy Foger a deserved  thrashing for giving a false clue was told of, and there was an account  of a race in which the Red Cloud (as the airship was called) took part,  as well as details of how Tom and his friends secured the reward, which  Andy Foger hoped to collect.    Those of you who care to know how the Red Cloud was constructed, and  how she behaved in the air, even during accidents and when struck by  lightning, may learn by reading the third volume, for the airship was  one of the most successful ever constructed.    When the craft was finished, and the navigators were ready to start on  their first long trip, Mr. Swift was asked to go with them. He  declined, but would not tell why, until Tom, pressing him for an  answer, learned that his father was planning a submarine boat, which he  hoped to enter in some trials for Government prizes. Mr. Swift remained  at home to work on this submarine, while his son and Mr. Sharp were  sailing above the clouds.    On their return, however, and after the bank mystery had been cleared  up, Tom and Mr. Sharp, aided Mr. Swift in completing the submarine,  until, when the present story opens, it needed but little additional  work to make the craft ready for the water.    Of course it had to be built near the sea, as it would have been  impossible to transport it overland from Shopton.  So, before the keel  was laid, Mr. Swift rented a large cottage at a seaside place on the  New Jersey coast and there, after erecting a large shed, the work on  the Advance, as the under-water ship was called, was begun.    It was soon to be launched in a large creek that extended in from the  ocean and had plenty of water at high tide. Tom and Mr. Sharp made  several trips back and forth from Shopton in their airship, to see that  all was safe at home and occasionally to get needed tools and supplies  from the shops, for not all the apparatus could be moved from Shopton  to the coast.    It was when returning from one of these trips that Tom brought with him  the paper containing an account of the wreck of the Boldero and the  sinking of the treasure she carried.    Until late that night the three fortune-hunters discussed various  matters.    \"We'll hurry work on the ship,\" said Mr. Swift at length.  \"Tom, I  wonder if your friend, Mr. Damon, would care to try how it seems under  water? He stood the air trip fairly well.\"    \"I'll write and ask him,\" answered the lad. \"I'm sure he'll go.\"    Securing, a few days later, the assistance of two mechanics, whom he  knew he could trust, for as yet the construction of the Advance was a  secret, Mr. Swift prepared to rush work on the submarine, and for the  next three weeks there were busy times in the shed next to the seaside  cottage. So busy, in fact, were Tom and Mr. Sharp, that they only found  opportunity for one trip in the airship, and that was to get some  supplies from the shops at home.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift one night, at the close of a hard day's  work, \"another week will see our craft completed.  Then we will put it  in the water and see how it floats, and whether it submerges as I hope  it does. But come on, Tom. I want to lock up. I'm very tired to-night.\"    \"All right, dad,\" answered the young inventor coming from the darkened  rear of the shop. \"I just want to--\"    He paused suddenly, and appeared to be listening. Then he moved softly  back to where he had come from.    \"What's the matter?\" asked his father in a whisper.  \"What's up, Tom?\"    The lad did not answer Mr. Swift, with a worried look on his face,  followed his son. Mr. Sharp stood in the door of the shop.    \"I thought I heard some one moving around back here,\" went on Tom  quietly.    \"Some one in this shop!\" exclaimed the aged inventor excitedly. \"Some  one trying to steal my ideas again! Mr. Sharp, come here! Bring that  rifle! We'll teach these scoundrels a lesson!\"    Tom quickly darted back to the extreme rear of the building. There was  a scuffle, and the next minute Tom cried out:    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"Ha! I beg your pardon,\" replied a voice. \"I am looking for Mr. Barton  Swift.\"    \"My father,\" remarked Tom. \"But that's a queer place to look for him.  He's up front. Father, here's a man who wishes to see you,\" he called.    \"Yes, I strolled in, and seeing no one about I went to the rear of the  place,\" the voice went on. \"I hope I haven't transgressed.\"    \"We were busy on the other side of the shop, I guess,\" replied Tom, and  he looked suspiciously at the man who emerged from the darkness into  the light from a window. \"I beg your pardon for grabbing you the way I  did,\" went on the lad, \"but I thought you were one of a gang of men  we've been having trouble with.\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" continued the man easily. \"I know Mr. Swift,  and I think he will remember me. Ah, Mr. Swift, how do you do?\" he  added quickly, catching sight of Tom's father, who, with Mr. Sharp, was  coming to meet the lad.    \"Addison Berg!\" exclaimed the aged inventor as he saw the man's face  more plainly. \"What are you doing here?\"    \"I came to see you,\" replied the man. \"May I have a talk with you  privately?\"    \"I--I suppose so,\" assented Mr. Swift nervously. \"Come into the house.\"    Mr. Berg left Tom's side and advanced to where Mr. Swift was standing.  Together the two emerged from the now fast darkening shop and went  toward the house.    \"Who is he?\" asked Mr. Sharp of the young inventor in a whisper.    \"I don't know,\" replied the lad; \"but, whoever he is, dad seems afraid  of him. I'm going to keep my eyes open.\"          Chapter Three    Mr. Berg is Astonished      Following his father and the stranger whom the aged inventor had  addressed as Mr. Berg, Tom and Mr. Sharp entered the house, the lad  having first made sure that Garret Jackson was on guard in the shop  that contained the submarine.    \"Now,\" said Mr. Swift to the newcomer, \"I am at your service. What is  it you wish?\"    \"In the first place, let me apologize for having startled you and your  friends,\" began the man. \"I had no idea of sneaking into your workshop,  but I had just arrived here, and seeing the doors open I went in. I  heard no one about, and I wandered to the back of the place. There I  happened to stumble over a board--\"    \"And I heard you,\" interrupted Tom.    \"Is this one of your employees?\" asked Mr. Berg in rather frigid tones.    \"That is my son,\" replied Mr. Swift.    \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\" The man's manner changed quickly.  \"Well, I  guess you did hear me, young man. I didn't intend to bark my shins the  way I did, either. You must have taken me for a burglar or a sneak  thief.\"    \"I have been very much bothered by a gang of unscrupulous men,\" said  Mr. Swift, \"and I suppose Tom thought it was some of them sneaking  around again.\"    \"That's what I did,\" added the lad. \"I wasn't going to have any one  steal the secret of the submarine if I could help it.\"    \"Quite right! Quite right!\" exclaimed Mr. Berg. \"But my purpose was an  open one. As you know, Mr. Swift, I represent the firm of Bentley &  Eagert, builders of submarine boats and torpedoes. They heard that you  were constructing a craft to take part in the competitive prize tests  of the United States Government, and they asked me to come and see you  to learn when your ship would be ready. Ours is completed, but we  recognize that it will be for the best interests of all concerned if  there are a number of contestants, and my firm did not want to send in  their entry until they knew that you were about finished with your  ship. How about it? Are you ready to compete?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Swift slowly. \"We are about ready. My craft needs a few  finishing touches, and then it will be ready to launch.\"    \"Then we may expect a good contest on your part,\" suggested Mr. Berg.    \"Well,\" began the aged inventor, \"I don't know about that.\"    \"What's that?\" exclaimed Mr. Berg.    \"I said I wasn't quite sure that we would compete,\" went on Mr. Swift.  \"You see, when I first got this idea for a submarine boat I had it in  mind to try for the Government prize of fifty thousand dollars.\"    \"That's what we want, too,\" interrupted Mr. Berg with a smile.    \"But,\" went on Tom's father, \"since then certain matters have come up,  and I think, on the whole, that we'll not compete for the prize after  all.\"    \"Not compete for the prize?\" almost shouted the agent for Bentley &  Eagert. \"Why, the idea! You ought to compete. It is good for the trade.  We think we have a very fine craft, and probably we would beat you in  the tests, but--\"    \"I wouldn't be too sure of that,\" put in Tom. \"You have only seen the  outside of our boat. The inside is better yet.\"    \"Ah, I have no doubt of that,\" spoke Mr. Berg, \"but we have been at the  business longer than you have, and have had more experience. Still we  welcome competition. But I am very much surprised that you are not  going to compete for the prize, Mr. Swift. Very much surprised, indeed!  You see, I came down from Philadelphia to arrange so that we could both  enter our ships at the same time. I understand there is another firm"]]]
