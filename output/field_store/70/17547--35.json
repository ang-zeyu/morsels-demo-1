Had the  heart the Wizard gave you been a Kind Heart, you would have gone back  home and made the beautiful Munchkin girl your wife, and then brought  her here to be an Empress and live in your splendid tin castle.\"    The Tin Woodman was so surprised at this frank speech that for a time  he did nothing but stare hard at the boy Wanderer. But the Scarecrow  wagged his stuffed head and said in a positive tone:    \"This boy is right. I've often wondered, myself, why you didn't go back  and find that poor Munchkin girl.\"    Then the Tin Woodman stared hard at his friend the Scarecrow. But  finally he said in a serious tone of voice:    \"I must admit that never before have I thought of such a thing as  finding Nimmie Amee and making her Empress of the Winkies. But it is  surely not too late, even now, to do this, for the girl must still be  living in the Munchkin Country. And, since this strange Wanderer has  reminded me of Nimmie Amee, I believe it is my duty to set out and find  her. Surely it is not the girl's fault that I no longer love her, and  so, if I can make her happy, it is proper that I should do so, and in  this way reward her for her faithfulness.\"    \"Quite right, my friend!\" agreed the Scarecrow.    \"Will you accompany me on this errand?\" asked the Tin Emperor.    \"Of course,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"And will you take me along?\" pleaded Woot the Wanderer in an eager  voice.    \"To be sure,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"if you care to join our party. It  was you who first told me it was my duty to find and marry Nimmie Amee,  and I'd like you to know that Nick Chopper, the Tin Emperor of the  Winkies, is a man who never shirks his duty, once it is pointed out to  him.\"    \"It ought to be a pleasure, as well as a duty, if the girl is so  beautiful,\" said Woot, well pleased with the idea of the adventure.    \"Beautiful things may be admired, if not loved,\" asserted the Tin Man.  \"Flowers are beautiful, for instance, but we are not inclined to marry  them. Duty, on the contrary, is a bugle call to action, whether you are  inclined to act, or not. In this case, I obey the bugle call of duty.\"    \"When shall we start?\" inquired the Scarecrow, who was always glad to  embark upon a new adventure. \"I don't hear any bugle, but when do we  go?\"    \"As soon as we can get ready,\" answered the Emperor. \"I'll call my  servants at once and order them to make preparations for our journey.\"          Chapter Three    Roundabout      Woot the Wanderer slept that night in the tin castle of the Emperor of  the Winkies and found his tin bed quite comfortable. Early the next  morning he rose and took a walk through the gardens, where there were  tin fountains and beds of curious tin flowers, and where tin birds  perched upon the branches of tin trees and sang songs that sounded like  the notes of tin whistles. All these wonders had been made by the  clever Winkie tinsmiths, who wound the birds up every morning so that  they would move about and sing.    After breakfast the boy went into the throne room, where the Emperor  was having his tin joints carefully oiled by a servant, while other  servants were stuffing sweet, fresh straw into the body of the  Scarecrow.    Woot watched this operation with much interest, for the Scarecrow's  body was only a suit of clothes filled with straw. The coat was  buttoned tight to keep the packed straw from falling out and a rope was  tied around the waist to hold it in shape and prevent the straw from  sagging down. The Scarecrow's head was a gunnysack filled with bran, on  which the eyes, nose and mouth had been painted. His hands were white  cotton gloves stuffed with fine straw. Woot noticed that even when  carefully stuffed and patted into shape, the straw man was awkward in  his movements and decidedly wobbly on his feet, so the boy wondered if  the Scarecrow would be able to travel with them all the way to the  forests of the Munchkin Country of Oz.    The preparations made for this important journey were very simple. A  knapsack was filled with food and given Woot the Wanderer to carry upon  his back, for the food was for his use alone. The Tin Woodman  shouldered an axe which was sharp and brightly polished, and the  Scarecrow put the Emperor's oil-can in his pocket, that he might oil  his friend's joints should they need it.    \"Who will govern the Winkie Country during your absence?\" asked the boy.    \"Why, the Country will run itself,\" answered the Emperor. \"As a matter  of fact, my people do not need an Emperor, for Ozma of Oz watches over  the welfare of all her subjects, including the Winkies. Like a good  many kings and emperors, I have a grand title, but very little real  power, which allows me time to amuse myself in my own way. The people  of Oz have but one law to obey, which is: 'Behave Yourself,' so it is  easy for them to abide by this Law, and you'll notice they behave very  well. But it is time for us to be off, and I am eager to start because  I suppose that that poor Munchkin girl is anxiously awaiting my coming.\"    \"She's waited a long time already, seems to me,\" remarked the  Scarecrow, as they left the grounds of the castle and followed a path  that led eastward.    \"True,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"but I've noticed that the last end of  a wait, however long it has been, is the hardest to endure; so I must  try to make Nimmie Amee happy as soon as possible.\"    \"Ah; that proves you have a Kind heart,\" remarked the Scarecrow,  approvingly.    \"It's too bad he hasn't a Loving Heart,\" said Woot. \"This Tin Man is  going to marry a nice girl through kindness, and not because he loves  her, and somehow that doesn't seem quite right.\"    \"Even so, I am not sure it isn't best for the girl,\" said the  Scarecrow, who seemed very intelligent for a straw man, \"for a loving  husband is not always kind, while a kind husband is sure to make any  girl content.\"    \"Nimmie Amee will become an Empress!\" announced the Tin Woodman,  proudly. \"I shall have a tin gown made for her, with tin ruffles and  tucks on it, and she shall have tin slippers, and tin earrings and  bracelets, and wear a tin crown on her head. I am sure that will  delight Nimmie Amee, for all girls are fond of finery.\"    \"Are we going to the Munchkin Country by way of the Emerald City?\"  inquired the Scarecrow, who looked upon the Tin Woodman as the leader  of the party.    \"I think not,\" was the reply. \"We are engaged upon a rather delicate  adventure, for we are seeking a girl who fears her former lover has  forgotten her. It will be rather hard for me, you must admit, when I  confess to Nimmie Amee that I have come to marry her because it is my  duty to do so, and therefore the fewer witnesses there are to our  meeting the better for both of us. After I have found Nimmie Amee and  she has managed to control her joy at our reunion, I shall take her to  the Emerald City and introduce her to Ozma and Dorothy, and to Betsy  Bobbin and Tiny Trot, and all our other friends; but, if I remember  rightly, poor Nimmie Amee has a sharp tongue when angry, and she may be  a trifle angry with me, at first, because I have been so long in coming  to her.\"    \"I can understand that,\" said Woot gravely. \"But how can we get to that  part of the Munchkin Country where you once lived without passing  through the Emerald City?\"    \"Why, that is easy,\" the Tin Man assured him.    \"I have a map of Oz in my pocket,\" persisted the boy, \"and it shows  that the Winkie Country, where we now are, is at the west of Oz, and  the Munchkin Country at the east, while directly between them lies the  Emerald City.\"    \"True enough; but we shall go toward the north, first of all, into the  Gillikin Country, and so pass around the Emerald City,\" explained the  Tin Woodman.    \"That may prove a dangerous journey,\" replied the boy. \"I used to live  in one of the top corners of the Gillikin Country, near to Oogaboo, and  I have been told that in this northland country are many people whom it  is not pleasant to meet. I was very careful to avoid them during my  journey south.\"    \"A Wanderer should have no fear,\" observed the Scarecrow, who was  wobbling along in a funny, haphazard manner, but keeping pace with his  friends.    \"Fear does not make one a coward,\" returned Woot, growing a little red  in the face, \"but I believe it is more easy to avoid danger than to  overcome it. The safest way is the best way, even for one who is brave  and determined.\"    \"Do not worry, for we shall not go far to the north,\" said the Emperor.  \"My one idea is to avoid the Emerald City without going out of our way  more than is necessary. Once around the Emerald City we will turn south  into the Munchkin Country, where the Scarecrow and I are well  acquainted and have many friends.\"    \"I have traveled some in the Gillikin Country,\" remarked the Scarecrow,  \"and while I must say I have met some strange people there at times, I  have never yet been harmed by them.\"    \"Well, it's all the same to me,\" said Woot, with assumed carelessness.  \"Dangers, when they cannot be avoided, are often quite interesting, and  I am willing to go wherever you two venture to go.\"    So they left the path they had been following and began to travel  toward the northeast, and all that day they were in the pleasant Winkie  Country, and all the people they met saluted the Emperor with great  respect and wished him good luck on his journey. At night they stopped  at a house where they were well entertained and where Woot was given a  comfortable bed to sleep in.    \"Were the Scarecrow and I alone,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"we would  travel by night as well as by day; but with a meat person in our party,  we must halt at night to permit him to rest.\"    \"Meat tires, after a day's travel,\" added the Scarecrow, \"while straw  and tin never tire at all. Which proves,\" said he, \"that we are  somewhat superior to people made in the common way.\"    Woot could not deny that he was tired,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#3)"],[1,"about the Skeezers and Flatheads until their return, and  Dorothy promised to obey. She longed to tell her girl friends, tiny  Trot and Betsy Bobbin, of the adventure they were undertaking, but  refrained from saying a word on the subject although both these girls  lived with her in Ozma's palace.    Indeed, only Glinda the Sorceress knew they were going, until after  they had gone, and even the Sorceress didn't know what their errand  might be.    Princess Ozma took the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, although she was not  sure there was a wagon road all the way to the Lake of the Skeezers.  The Land of Oz is a pretty big place, surrounded on all sides by a  Deadly Desert which it is impossible to cross, and the Skeezer Country,  according to the map, was in the farthest northwestern part of Oz,  bordering on the north desert. As the Emerald City was exactly in the  center of Oz, it was no small journey from there to the Skeezers.    Around the Emerald City the country is thickly settled in every  direction, but the farther away you get from the city the fewer people  there are, until those parts that border on the desert have small  populations. Also those faraway sections are little known to the Oz  people, except in the south, where Glinda lives and where Dorothy has  often wandered on trips of exploration.    The least known of all is the Gillikin Country, which harbors many  strange bands of people among its mountains and valleys and forests and  streams, and Ozma was now bound for the most distant part of the  Gillikin Country.    \"I am really sorry,\" said Ozma to Dorothy, as they rode away in the Red  Wagon, \"not to know more about the wonderful Land I rule. It is my duty  to be acquainted with every tribe of people and every strange and  hidden country in all Oz, but I am kept so busy at my palace making  laws and planning for the comforts of those who live near the Emerald  City, that I do not often find time to make long journeys.\"    \"Well,\" replied Dorothy, \"we'll prob'bly find out a lot on this trip,  and we'll learn all about the Skeezers and Flatheads, anyhow. Time  doesn't make much diff'rence in the Land of Oz, 'cause we don't grow  up, or get old, or become sick and die, as they do other places; so, if  we explore one place at a time, we'll by-an'-by know all about every  nook and corner in Oz.\"    Dorothy wore around her waist the Nome King's Magic Belt, which  protected her from harm, and the Magic Ring which Glinda had given her  was on her finger. Ozma had merely slipped a small silver wand into the  bosom of her gown, for fairies do not use chemicals and herbs and the  tools of wizards and sorcerers to perform their magic. The Silver Wand  was Ozma's one weapon of offense and defense and by its use she could  accomplish many things.    They had left the Emerald City just at sunrise and the Sawhorse  traveled very swiftly over the roads towards the north, but in a few  hours the wooden animal had to slacken his pace because the farm houses  had become few and far between and often there were no paths at all in  the direction they wished to follow. At such times they crossed the  fields, avoiding groups of trees and fording the streams and rivulets  whenever they came to them. But finally they reached a broad hillside  closely covered with scrubby brush, through which the wagon could not  pass.    \"It will be difficult even for you and me to get through without  tearing our dresses,\" said Ozma, \"so we must leave the Sawhorse and the  Wagon here until our return.\"    \"That's all right,\" Dorothy replied, \"I'm tired riding, anyhow. Do you  s'pose, Ozma, we're anywhere near the Skeezer Country?\"    \"I cannot tell, Dorothy dear, but I know we've been going in the right  direction, so we are sure to find it in time.\"    The scrubby brush was almost like a grove of small trees, for it  reached as high as the heads of the two girls, neither of whom was very  tall. They were obliged to thread their way in and out, until Dorothy  was afraid they would get lost, and finally they were halted by a  curious thing that barred their further progress. It was a huge web--as  if woven by gigantic spiders--and the delicate, lacy film was fastened  stoutly to the branches of the bushes and continued to the right and  left in the form of a half circle. The threads of this web were of a  brilliant purple color and woven into numerous artistic patterns, but  it reached from the ground to branches above the heads of the girls and  formed a sort of fence that hedged them in.    \"It doesn't look very strong, though,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder if we  couldn't break through.\" She tried but found the web stronger than it  seemed. All her efforts could not break a single thread.    \"We must go back, I think, and try to get around this peculiar web,\"  Ozma decided.    So they turned to the right and, following the web found that it seemed  to spread in a regular circle. On and on they went until finally Ozma  said they had returned to the exact spot from which they had started.  \"Here is a handkerchief you dropped when we were here before,\" she said  to Dorothy.    \"In that case, they must have built the web behind us, after we walked  into the trap,\" exclaimed the little girl.    \"True,\" agreed Ozma, \"an enemy has tried to imprison us.\"    \"And they did it, too,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder who it was.\"    \"It's a spider-web, I'm quite sure,\" returned Ozma, \"but it must be the  work of enormous spiders.\"    \"Quite right!\" cried a voice behind them. Turning quickly around they  beheld a huge purple spider sitting not two yards away and regarding  them with its small bright eyes.    Then there crawled from the bushes a dozen more great purple spiders,  which saluted the first one and said:    \"The web is finished, O King, and the strangers are our prisoners.\"    Dorothy did not like the looks of these spiders at all. They had big  heads, sharp claws, small eyes and fuzzy hair all over their purple  bodies.    \"They look wicked,\" she whispered to Ozma. \"What shall we do?\"    Ozma gazed upon the spiders with a serious face.    \"What is your object in making us prisoners?\" she inquired.    \"We need someone to keep house for us,\" answered the Spider King.  \"There is sweeping and dusting to be done, and polishing and washing of  dishes, and that is work my people dislike to do. So we decided that if  any strangers came our way we would capture them and make them our  servants.\"    \"I am Princess Ozma, Ruler of all Oz,\" said the girl with dignity.    \"Well, I am King of all Spiders,\" was the reply, \"and that makes me  your master. Come with me to my palace and I will instruct you in your  work.\"    \"I won't,\" said Dorothy indignantly. \"We won't have anything to do with  you.\"    \"We'll see about that,\" returned the Spider in a severe tone, and the  next instant he made a dive straight at Dorothy, opening the claws in  his legs as if to grab and pinch her with the sharp points. But the  girl was wearing her Magic Belt and was not harmed. The Spider King  could not even touch her. He turned swiftly and made a dash at Ozma,  but she held her Magic Wand over his head and the monster recoiled as  if it had been struck.    \"You'd better let us go,\" Dorothy advised him, \"for you see you can't  hurt us.\"    \"So I see,\" returned the Spider King angrily. \"Your magic is greater  than mine. But I'll not help you to escape. If you can break the magic  web my people have woven you may go; if not you must stay here and  starve.\" With that the Spider King uttered a peculiar whistle and all  the spiders disappeared.    \"There is more magic in my fairyland than I dreamed of,\" remarked the  beautiful Ozma, with a sigh of regret. \"It seems that my laws have not  been obeyed, for even these monstrous spiders defy me by means of  Magic.\"    \"Never mind that now,\" said Dorothy; \"let's see what we can do to get  out of this trap.\"    They now examined the web with great care and were amazed at its  strength. Although finer than the finest silken hairs, it resisted all  their efforts to work through, even though both girls threw all their  weight against it.    \"We must find some instrument which will cut the threads of the web,\"  said Ozma, finally. \"Let us look about for such a tool.\"    So they wandered among the bushes and finally came to a shallow pool of  water, formed by a small bubbling spring. Dorothy stooped to get a  drink and discovered in the water a green crab, about as big as her  hand. The crab had two big, sharp claws, and as soon as Dorothy saw  them she had an idea that those claws could save them.    \"Come out of the water,\" she called to the crab; \"I want to talk to  you.\"    Rather lazily the crab rose to the surface and caught hold of a bit of  rock. With his head above the water he said in a cross voice:    \"What do you want?\"    \"We want you to cut the web of the purple spiders with your claws, so  we can get through it,\" answered Dorothy. \"You can do that, can't you?\"    \"I suppose so,\" replied the crab. \"But if I do what will you give me?\"    \"What do you wish?\" Ozma inquired.    \"I wish to be white, instead of green,\" said the crab. \"Green crabs are  very common, and white ones are rare; besides the purple spiders, which  infest this hillside, are afraid of white crabs. Could you make me  white if I should agree to cut the web for you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ozma, \"I can do that easily. And, so you may know I am  speaking the truth, I will change your color now.\"    She waved her silver wand over the pool and the crab instantly became  snow-white--all except his eyes, which remained black. The creature saw  his reflection in the water and was so delighted that he at once  climbed out of the pool and began moving slowly toward the web, by  backing away from the pool. He moved so very slowly that Dorothy cried  out impatiently: \"Dear me, this will never do!\" Caching the crab in her  hands she ran with him to the web.    She had to hold "]]]
