For an hour the swift ship fought with the waves. The oarsmen were  rowing for their lives. The master's arm was strong, and his heart was  not for a minute afraid. The wind was helping. At last they reached calm  waters.    \"Thanks be to the gods!\" cried Tetreius. \"We are out of that boiling  pot.\"    At his words fire shot out of the mountain. It glowed red in the dusty  air. It flung great red arms across the sky after the ship. Every man  and spar and oar on the vessel seemed burning in its light. Then the  fire died, and thick darkness swallowed everything. Ariston's heart  seemed smothered in his breast. He heard the slaves on the rowers'  benches scream with fear. Then he heard their leader crying to them. He  heard a whip whiz through the air and strike on bare shoulders. Then  there was a crash as though the mountain had clapped its hands. A  thicker shower of ashes filled the air. But the rowers were at their  oars again. The ship was flying.    So for two hours or more Tetreius and his men fought for safety. Then  they came out into fresher air and calmer water. Tetreius left the  rudder. \"Let the men rest and thank the gods,\" he said to his overseer.  \"We have come up out of the grave.\"    When Ariston heard that, he remembered the Death he had left painted  on his master's wall. By that time the picture was surely buried under  stones and ashes. The boy covered his face with his ragged chiton and  wept. He hardly knew what he was crying for--the slavery, the picture,  the buried city, the fear of that horrid night, the sorrows of the  people left back there, his father, his dear home in Athens. At last  he fell asleep. The night was horrible with dreams--fire, earthquake,  strangling ashes, cries, thunder, lightning. But his tired body held  him asleep for several hours. Finally he awoke. He was lying on a soft  mattress. A warm blanket covered him. Clean air filled his nostrils. The  gentle light of dawn lay upon his eyes. A strange face bent over him.    \"It is only weariness,\" a kind voice was saying. \"He needs food and rest  more than medicine.\"    Then Ariston saw Tetreius, also, bending over him. The slave leaped to  his feet. He was ashamed to be caught asleep in his master's presence.  He feared a frown for his laziness.    \"My picture is finished, master,\" he cried, still half asleep.    \"And so is your slavery,\" said Tetreius, and his eyes shone.    \"It was not a slave who carried my son out of hell on his back. It was a  hero.\" He turned around and called, \"Come hither, my friends.\"    Three Roman gentlemen stepped up. They looked kindly upon Ariston.    \"This is the lad who saved my son,\" said Tetreius. \"I call you to  witness that he is no longer a slave. Ariston, I send you from my hand a  free man.\"    He struck his hand lightly on the Greek's shoulder, as all Roman masters  did when they freed a slave. Ariston cried aloud with joy. He sank to  his knees weeping. But Tetreius went on.    \"This kind physician says that Caius will live. But he needs good air  and good nursing. He must go to some one of Aesculapius' holy places. He  shall sleep in the temple and sit in the shady porches, and walk in the  sacred groves. The wise priests will give him medicines. The god will  send healing dreams. Do you know of any such place, Ariston?\"    The Greek thought of the temple and garden of Aesculapius on the sunny  side of the Acropolis at home in Athens. But he could not speak. He  gazed hungrily into Tetreius' eyes. The Roman smiled.    \"Ariston, this ship is bound for Athens! All my life I have loved  her--her statues, her poems, her great deeds. I have wished that my son  might learn from her wise men. The volcano has buried my home, Ariston.  But my wealth and my friends and my son are aboard this ship. What do  you say, my friend? Will you be our guide in Athens?\" Ariston leaped up  from his knees. A fire of joy burned in his eyes. He stretched his hands  to the sky.    \"O blessed Herakles,\" he cried, \"again thou hast conquered Death. Thou  didst snatch us from the grave of Pompeii. Give health to this Roman  boy. O fairest Athena, shed new beauty upon our violet crowned Athens.  For there is coming to visit her the best of men, my master Tetreius.\"      [Illustration: _A Marble Table_: The lions' heads were painted yellow.  You can see a table much like this in the garden pictured later.]          VESUVIUS    So a living city was buried in a few hours. Wooded hills and green  fields lay covered under great ash heaps. Ever since that terrible  eruption Vesuvius has been restless. Sometimes she has been quiet for  a hundred years or more and men have almost forgotten that she ever  thundered and spouted and buried cities. But all at once she would move  again. She would shoot steam and ashes into the sky. At night fire  would leap out of her top. A few times she sent out dust and lava and  destroyed houses and fields. A man who lived five hundred years after  Pompeii was destroyed described Vesuvius as she was in his time. He  said:    \"This mountain is steep and thick with woods below. Above, it is very  craggy and wild. At the top is a deep cave. It seems to reach the bottom  of the mountain. If you peep in you can see fire. But this ordinarily  keeps in and does not trouble the people. But sometimes the mountain  bellows like an ox. Soon after it casts out huge masses of cinders. If  these catch a man, he hath no way to save his life. If they fall upon  houses, the roofs are crushed by the weight. If the wind blow stiff,  the ashes rise out of sight and are carried to far countries. But this  bellowing comes only every hundred years or thereabout. And the air  around the mountain is pure. None is more healthy. Physicians send  thither sick men to get well.\"    The ashes that had covered Pompeii changed to rich soil. Green vines  and shrubs and trees sprang up and covered it, and flowers made it gay.  Therefore people said to themselves:    \"After all, she is a good old mountain. There will never be another  eruption while we are alive.\"    So villages grew up around her feet. Farmers came and built little  houses and planted crops and were happy working the fertile soil. They  did not dream that they were living above a buried city, that the roots  of their vines sucked water from an old Roman house, that buried statues  lay gazing up toward them as they worked.    About three hundred years ago came another terrible eruption. Again  there were earthquakes. Again the mountain bellowed. Again black clouds  turned day into night. Lightning flashed from cloud to cloud. Tempests  of hot rain fell. The sea rushed back and forth on the shore. The whole  top of the mountain was blown out or sank into the melting pot. Seven  rivers of red-hot lava poured down the slopes. They flowed for five  miles and fell into the sea. On the way they set fire to forests and  covered five little villages. Thousands of people were killed.    Since that time Vesuvius has been very active. Almost every year there  have been eruptions with thunder and earthquakes and showers and lava.  A few of these have done much damage. [Footnote: In this year, 1922,  Vesuvius has been very active for the first time since 1906. It has been  causing considerable alarm in Naples. A new cone, 230 feet high, has  developed.--Ed.] And even on her calmest days a cloud has always hung  above the mountain top. Sometimes it has been thin and white--a cloud of  steam. Sometimes it has been black and curling--a cloud of dust.    Vesuvius is a dangerous thing, but very beautiful. It stands tall and  pointed and graceful against a lovely sky. Its little cloud waves from  it like a plume. At night the mountain is swallowed by the dark. But  the red rivers down its slopes glare in the sky. It is beautiful and  terrible like a tiger. Thousands of people have loved it. They have  climbed it and looked down its crater. It is like looking into the heart  of the earth. One of these travelers wrote of his visit in 1793. He  said:    \"For many days Vesuvius has been in action. I have watched it from  Naples. It is wonderfully beautiful and always changing. On one day huge  clouds poured out of the top. They hung in the sky far above, white as  snow. Suddenly a cloud of smoke rushed out of another mouth. It was as  black as ink. The black column rose tall and curling beside the snowy  clouds. That was a picture in black and white. But at another time I saw  one in bright colors.    \"On a certain night there were towers and curls and waves and spires of  flames leaping from the top of the mountain. Millions of red-hot stones  were shot into the sky. They sailed upward for hundreds of feet, then  curved and fell like skyrockets. I looked through my telescope and saw  liquid lava boiling and bubbling over the crater's edge. I could see it  splash upon the rocks and glide slowly down the sides of the cone. The  whole top of the mountain was red with melted rock. And above it waved  the changing flames of red, orange, yellow, blue.    \"On another night, as I was getting into bed, I felt an earthquake. I  looked out of my window toward Vesuvius. All the top was glowing with  red-hot matter. A terrible roaring came from the mountain. In an instant  fire shot high into the air. The red column curved and showered the  whole cone. In half a minute came another earthquake shock. My doors and  windows rattled. Things were shaken from my table to the floor. Then  came the thunder of an explosion from the mountain and another shower  of fire. After a few seconds there were noises like the trampling of  horses' hoofs. It was, of course, the noise of the shot-out stones  falling upon the rocks of the mountainsides eight miles away.    \"I decided to ascend the volcano and see the crater from which all these  interesting things came. A few friends went with me. For most of the way  we traveled on horses."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#3)"],[1," the other by thick  box-bushes, laurels, and other evergreens. The ground was almost bare of  grass and dark of aspect. Remains of rustic seats and an old and  corrugated oak post somewhere near the middle of the clearing had given  rise to Mr Anstruther's conjecture that a summer-house had once stood  there.    Clearly Collins had not been put in possession of his mistress's  intentions with regard to this plot of ground: and when he learnt them  from Mr Anstruther he displayed no enthusiasm.    'Of course I could clear them seats away soon enough,' he said. 'They  aren't no ornament to the place, Mr Anstruther, and rotten too. Look  'ere, sir,'--and he broke off a large piece--'rotten right through. Yes,  clear them away, to be sure we can do that.'    'And the post,' said Mr Anstruther, 'that's got to go too.'    Collins advanced, and shook the post with both hands: then he rubbed his  chin.    'That's firm in the ground, that post is,' he said. 'That's been there a  number of years, Mr Anstruther. I doubt I shan't get that up not quite so  soon as what I can do with them seats.'    'But your mistress specially wishes it to be got out of the way in an  hour's time,' said Mr Anstruther.    Collins smiled and shook his head slowly. 'You'll excuse me, sir, but you  feel of it for yourself. No, sir, no one can't do what's impossible to  'em, can they, sir? I could git that post up by after tea-time, sir, but  that'll want a lot of digging. What you require, you see, sir, if you'll  excuse me naming of it, you want the soil loosening round this post 'ere,  and me and the boy we shall take a little time doing of that. But now,  these 'ere seats,' said Collins, appearing to appropriate this portion of  the scheme as due to his own resourcefulness, 'why, I can get the barrer  round and 'ave them cleared away in, why less than an hour's time from  now, if you'll permit of it. Only--'    'Only what, Collins?'    'Well now, it ain't for me to go against orders no more than what it is for  you yourself--or anyone else' (this was added somewhat hurriedly), 'but  if you'll pardon me, sir, this ain't the place I should have picked out  for no rose garden myself. Why look at them box and laurestinus, 'ow they  reg'lar preclude the light from--'    'Ah yes, but we've got to get rid of some of them, of course.'    'Oh, indeed, get rid of them! Yes, to be sure, but--I beg your pardon, Mr  Anstruther--'    'I'm sorry, Collins, but I must be getting on now. I hear the car at the  door. Your mistress will explain exactly what she wishes. I'll tell her,  then, that you can see your way to clearing away the seats at once, and  the post this afternoon. Good morning.'    Collins was left rubbing his chin. Mrs Anstruther received the report  with some discontent, but did not insist upon any change of plan.    By four o'clock that afternoon she had dismissed her husband to his golf,  had dealt faithfully with Collins and with the other duties of the day,  and, having sent a campstool and umbrella to the proper spot, had just  settled down to her sketch of the church as seen from the shrubbery, when  a maid came hurrying down the path to report that Miss Wilkins had  called.    Miss Wilkins was one of the few remaining members of the family from whom  the Anstruthers had bought the Westfield estate some few years back. She  had been staying in the neighbourhood, and this was probably a farewell  visit. 'Perhaps you could ask Miss Wilkins to join me here,' said Mrs  Anstruther, and soon Miss Wilkins, a person of mature years, approached.    'Yes, I'm leaving the Ashes to-morrow, and I shall be able to tell my  brother how tremendously you have improved the place. Of course he can't  help regretting the old house just a little--as I do myself--but the  garden is really delightful now.'    'I am so glad you can say so. But you mustn't think we've finished our  improvements. Let me show you where I mean to put a rose garden. It's  close by here.'    The details of the project were laid before Miss Wilkins at some length;  but her thoughts were evidently elsewhere.    'Yes, delightful,' she said at last rather absently. 'But do you know,  Mrs Anstruther, I'm afraid I was thinking of old times. I'm _very_ glad  to have seen just this spot again before you altered it. Frank and I had  quite a romance about this place.'    'Yes?' said Mrs Anstruther smilingly; 'do tell me what it was. Something  quaint and charming, I'm sure.'    'Not so very charming, but it has always seemed to me curious. Neither of  us would ever be here alone when we were children, and I'm not sure that  I should care about it now in certain moods. It is one of those things  that can hardly be put into words--by me at least--and that sound rather  foolish if they are not properly expressed. I can tell you after a  fashion what it was that gave us--well, almost a horror of the place when  we were alone. It was towards the evening of one very hot autumn day,  when Frank had disappeared mysteriously about the grounds, and I was  looking for him to fetch him to tea, and going down this path I suddenly  saw him, not hiding in the bushes, as I rather expected, but sitting on  the bench in the old summer-house--there was a wooden summer-house here,  you know--up in the corner, asleep, but with such a dreadful look on his  face that I really thought he must be ill or even dead. I rushed at him  and shook him, and told him to wake up; and wake up he did, with a  scream. I assure you the poor boy seemed almost beside himself with  fright. He hurried me away to the house, and was in a terrible state all  that night, hardly sleeping. Someone had to sit up with him, as far as I  remember. He was better very soon, but for days I couldn't get him to say  why he had been in such a condition. It came out at last that he had  really been asleep and had had a very odd disjointed sort of dream. He  never _saw_ much of what was around him, but he _felt_ the scenes most  vividly. First he made out that he was standing in a large room with a  number of people in it, and that someone was opposite to him who was  \"very powerful\", and he was being asked questions which he felt to be  very important, and, whenever he answered them, someone--either the  person opposite to him, or someone else in the room--seemed to be, as he  said, making something up against him. All the voices sounded to him very  distant, but he remembered bits of the things that were said: \"Where were  you on the 19th of October?\" and \"Is this your handwriting?\" and so on. I  can see now, of course, that he was dreaming of some trial: but we were  never allowed to see the papers, and it was odd that a boy of eight  should have such a vivid idea of what went on in a court. All the time he  felt, he said, the most intense anxiety and oppression and hopelessness  (though I don't suppose he used such words as that to me). Then, after  that, there was an interval in which he remembered being dreadfully  restless and miserable, and then there came another sort of picture, when  he was aware that he had come out of doors on a dark raw morning with a  little snow about. It was in a street, or at any rate among houses, and  he felt that there were numbers and numbers of people there too, and that  he was taken up some creaking wooden steps and stood on a sort of  platform, but the only thing he could actually see was a small fire  burning somewhere near him. Someone who had been holding his arm left  hold of it and went towards this fire, and then he said the fright he was  in was worse than at any other part of his dream, and if I had not  wakened him up he didn't know what would have become of him. A curious  dream for a child to have, wasn't it? Well, so much for that. It must  have been later in the year that Frank and I were here, and I was sitting  in the arbour just about sunset. I noticed the sun was going down, and  told Frank to run in and see if tea was ready while I finished a chapter  in the book I was reading. Frank was away longer than I expected, and the  light was going so fast that I had to bend over my book to make it out.  All at once I became conscious that someone was whispering to me inside  the arbour. The only words I could distinguish, or thought I could, were  something like \"Pull, pull. I'll push, you pull.\"    'I started up in something of a fright. The voice--it was little more  than a whisper--sounded so hoarse and angry, and yet as if it came from a  long, long way off--just as it had done in Frank's dream. But, though I  was startled, I had enough courage to look round and try to make out  where the sound came from. And--this sounds very foolish, I know, but  still it is the fact--I made sure that it was strongest when I put my ear  to an old post which was part of the end of the seat. I was so certain of  this that I remember making some marks on the post--as deep as I could  with the scissors out of my work-basket. I don't know why. I wonder, by  the way, whether that isn't the very post itself.... Well, yes, it might  be: there _are_ marks and scratches on it--but one can't be sure. Anyhow,  it was just like that post you have there. My father got to know that  both of us had had a fright in the arbour, and he went down there himself  one evening after dinner, and the arbour was pulled down at very short  notice. I recollect hearing my father talking about it to an old man who  used to do odd jobs in the place, and the old man saying, \"Don't you fear  for that, sir: he's fast enough in there without no one don't take and  let him out.\" But when I asked who it was, I could get no satisfactory  answer. Possibly my father or mother might have told me more about it  when I grew up, but, as you know, they both died when we were still quite  children. I must say it has always seemed very odd to me, and I've often  asked the older people in the village whether they knew of anything  strange: but either"]]]
