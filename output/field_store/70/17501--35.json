Geta, who, according to Jul.  Capitolinus [74], was so curious, so whimsical, as to order the  dishes at his dinners to consist of things which all began with the  same letters. Sardanapalus again as we have it in Athenæus [75], gave  a _præmium_ to any one that invented and served him with some novel  cate; and Sergius Orata built a house at the entrance of the Lucrine  lake, purposely for the pleasure and convenience of eating the  oysters perfectly fresh. Richard II is certainly not represented in  story as resembling any such epicures, or capriccioso's, as these  [76]. It may, however, be fairly presumed, that good living was not  wanting among the luxuries of that effeminate and dissipated reign.    [Addenda: after _ninth Iliad_, add, 'And Dr. _Shaw_ writes, p. 301,  that even now in the East, the greatest prince is not ashamed to  fetch a lamb from his herd and kill it, whilst the princess is  impatient till she hath prepared her fire and her kettle to dress  it.']    [Addenda: after _heretofore_ add, 'we have some good families in  England of the name of _Cook_ or _Coke_. I know not what they may  think; but we may depend upon it, they all originally sprang from  real and professional cooks; and they need not be ashamed of their  extraction, any more than the _Butlers_, _Parkers_, _Spencers_, &c.']    My next observation is, that the messes both in the roll and the  Editor's MS, are chiefly soups, potages, ragouts, hashes, and the  like hotche-potches; entire joints of meat being never _served_, and  animals, whether fish or fowl, seldom brought to table whole, but  hacked and hewed, and cut in pieces or gobbets [77]; the mortar also  was in great request, some messes being actually denominated from it,  as _mortrews_, or _morterelys_ as in the Editor's MS. Now in this  state of things, the general mode of eating must either have been  with the spoon or the fingers; and this perhaps may have been the  reason that spoons became an usual present from gossips to their  god-children at christenings [78]; and that the bason and ewer, for  washing before and after dinner, was introduced, whence the _ewerer_  was a great officer [79], and the _ewery_ is retained at Court to  this day [80]; we meet with _damaske water_ after dinner [81], I  presume, perfumed; and the words _ewer_ &c. plainly come from the  Saxon eþe or French eau, _water_.    Thus, to return, in that little anecdote relative to the Conqueror  and William Fitz-Osbern, mentioned above, not the crane, but _the  flesh of the crane_ is said to have been under-roasted. Table, or  case-knives, would be of little use at this time [82], and the art of  carving so perfectly useless, as to be almost unknown. In about a  century afterwards, however, as appears from archbishop Neville's  entertainment, many articles were served whole, and lord Wylloughby  was the carver [83]. So that carving began now to be practised, and  the proper terms devised. Wynken de Worde printed a _Book of  Kervinge_, A. 1508, wherein the said terms are registered [84]. 'The  use of _forks_ at table, says Dr. Percy, did not prevail in England  land till the reign of James I. as we learn from a remarkable passage  in _Coryat_ [85]'; the passage is indeed curious, but too long to be  here transcribed, where brevity is so much in view; wherefore I shall  only add, that forks are not now used in some parts of Spain [86].  But then it may be said, what becomes of the old English hospitaliy  in this case, the _roast-beef of Old England_, so much talked of? I  answer, these bulky and magnificent dishes must have been the product  of later reigns, perhaps of queen Elizabeth's time, since it is plain  that in the days of Rich. II. our ancestors lived much after the  French fashion. As to hospitality, the households of our Nobles were  immense, officers, retainers, and servants, being entertained almost  without number; but then, as appears from the Northumberland Book,  and afterwards from the household establisliment of the prince of  Wales, A. 1610, the individuals, or at least small parties, had their  _quantum_, or ordinary, served out, where any good oeconomy was kept,  apart to themselves [87]. Again, we find in our Roll, that great  quantities of the respective viands of the hashes, were often made at  once, as No. 17, _Take hennes or conynges_. 24, _Take hares_. 29,  _Take pygges_. And 31, _Take gees_, &c. So that hospitality and  plentiful housekeeping could just as well be maintained this way, as  by the other of cumbrous unwieldy messes, as much as a man could  carry.    As the messes and sauces are so complex, and the ingredients  consequently so various, it seems necessary that a word should be  spoken concerning the principal of them, and such as are more  frequently employed, before we pass to our method of proceeding in  the publication.    Butter is little used. 'Tis first mentioned No. 81, and occurs but  rarely after [88]; 'tis found but once in the Editor's MS, where it  is written _boter_. The usual substitutes for it are oil-olive and  lard; the latter is frequently called _grees_, or _grece_, or  _whitegrece_, as No. 18. 193. _Capons in Grease_ occur in Birch's  Life of Henry prince of Wales, p. 459, 460. and see Lye in Jun. Etym.  v. _Greasie_. Bishop Patrick has a remarkable passage concerning  this article: 'Though we read of cheese in _Homer_, _Euripides_,  _Theocritus_, and others, yet they never mention _butter_: nor hath  Aristotle a word of it, though he hath sundry observations about  cheese; for butter was not a thing then known among the _Greeks_;  though we see by this and many other places, it was an ancient food  among the eastern people [89].' The Greeks, I presume, used oil  instead of it, and butter in some places of scripture is thought to  mean only cream. [90]    Cheese. See the last article, and what is said of the old Britons  above; as likewise our Glossary.    Ale is applied, No. 113, et alibi; and often in the Editor's MS. as  6, 7, &c. It is used instead of wine, No. 22, and sometimes along  with bread in the Editor's MS. [91] Indeed it is a current opinion  that brewing with hops was not introduced here till the reign of king  Henry VIII. [92] _Bere_, however, is mentioned A. 1504. [93]    Wine is common, both red, and white, No. 21. 53. 37. This article  they partly had of their own growth, [94] and partly by importation  from France [95] and Greece [96]. They had also Rhenish [97], and  probably several other sorts. The _vynegreke_ is among the sweet  wines in a MS of Mr. Astle.    Rice. As this grain was but little, if at all, cultivated in England,  it must have been brought from abroad. Whole or ground-rice enters  into a large number of our compositions, and _resmolle_, No. 96, is a  direct preparation of it.    Alkenet. _Anchusa_ is not only used for colouring, but also fried and  yfoundred, 62. yfondyt, 162. i. e. dissolved, or ground. 'Tis thought  to be a species of the _buglos_.    Saffron. Saffrwm, Brit. whence it appears, that this name ran through  most languages. Mr. Weever informs us, that this excellent drug was  brought hither in the time of Edward III. [98] and it may be true;  but still no such quantity could be produced here in the next reign  as to supply that very large consumption which we see made of it in  our Roll, where it occurs not only as an ingredient in the processes,  but also is used for colouring, for flourishing, or garnishing. It  makes a yellow, No. 68, and was imported from Egypt, or Cilicia, or  other parts of the Levant, where the Turks call it Safran, from the  Arabic Zapheran, whence the English, Italians, French, and Germans,  have apparently borrowed their respective names of it. The Romans  were well acquainted with the drug, but did not use it much in the  kitchen [99]. Pere Calmet says, the Hebrews were acquainted with  anise, ginger, saffron, but no other spices [100].    Pynes. There is some difficulty in enucleating the meaning of this  word, though it occurs so often. It is joined with dates, No. 20. 52.  with honey clarified, 63. with powder-fort, saffron, and salt, 161.  with ground dates, raisins, good powder, and salt, 186. and lastly  they are fried, 38. Now the dish here is _morree_, which in the  Editor's MS. 37, is made of mulberries (and no doubt has its name  from them), and yet there are no mulberries in our dish, but pynes,  and therefore I suspect, that mulberries and pynes are the same, and  indeed this fruit has some resemblance to a pynecone. I conceive  _pynnonade_, the dish, No. 51, to be so named from the pynes therein  employed; and quære whether _pyner_ mentioned along with powder-fort,  saffron, and salt, No. 155, as above in No. 161, should not be read  _pynes_. But, after all, we have cones brought hither from Italy full  of nuts, or kernels, which upon roasting come out of their _capsulæ_,  and are much eaten by the common people, and these perhaps may be the  thing intended.    [Addenda: after _intended_. add, 'See _Ray_, Trav. p. 283. 407. and  _Wright's_ Trav. p. 112.']    Honey was the great and universal sweetner in remote antiquity, and  particularly in this island, where it was the chief constituent of  _mead_ and _metheglin_. It is said, that at this day in _Palestine_  they use honey in the greatest part of their ragouts [101]. Our cooks  had a method of clarifying it, No. 18. 41. which was done by putting  it in a pot with whites of eggs and water, beating them well together;  then setting it over the fire, and boiling it; and when it was ready  to boil over to take it and cool it, No. 59. This I presume is called  _clere honey_, No. 151. And, when honey was so much in use, it  appears from Barnes that _refining_ it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8106"],[0,"Captain Cook's Journal During His First Voyage Round the World (#3)"],[1,"ion, and returned to England in 1759.    By Palliser's interest Cook was now appointed master of the Mercury. It  is therefore evident that his qualifications as a navigator recommended  themselves to Palliser.    The Mercury went to North America, and here Cook did his first good  service recorded, namely, taking soundings in the St. Lawrence, to enable  the fleet then attacking Quebec to take up safe positions in covering the  army under Wolfe. This he accomplished with great skill, under many  difficulties, in the face of the enemy, much of it being done at night.  He was immediately employed in making a survey of the intricate channels  of the river below Quebec, and for many years his chart was the guide for  navigation. Cook was indeed a born surveyor. Before his day charts were  of the crudest description, and he must have somehow acquired a  considerable knowledge of trigonometry, and possessed an intuitive  faculty for practically applying it, to enable him to originate, as it  may truly be said he did, the art of modern marine surveying.    The expedition to Quebec concluded, Cook was appointed master of the  Northumberland, bearing Admiral Lord Colville's flag, and during that  ship's winter at Halifax he applied himself to further study of  mathematics and astronomy.    In 1762, the Northumberland being at Newfoundland during the capture of  that island from the French, Cook again was employed in surveys. This  attracted the attention of Captain Graves, the Governor, who conceived a  high opinion of his abilities in this respect.    In the latter part of 1762 Cook returned to England and married Elizabeth  Batts, daughter of a man in business at Wapping; but a few months  afterwards he was called upon by Captain Graves to go again to  Newfoundland to make marine surveys.    In this important work he was engaged until 1767, Captain Palliser, who  succeeded Captain Graves as Governor, being only too glad to avail  himself of Cook's services.    The charts he made during these years in the schooner Grenville were  admirable. The best proof of their excellence is that they are not yet  wholly superseded by the more detailed surveys of modern times. Like all  first surveys of a practically unknown shore, and especially when that  shore abounds in rocks and shoals, and is much indented with bays and  creeks, they are imperfect, in the sense of having many omissions; but  when the amount of the ground covered, and the impediments of fogs and  bad weather on that coast is considered, and that Cook had at the most  only one assistant, their accuracy is truly astonishing. The originals of  these surveys form part of the most precious possessions of the  Hydrographic Office of the Admiralty.    We now approach the crowning achievements of Cook's life.    After many years' neglect the exploration of the Pacific was awaking  interest. This great ocean, which very few, even to this day, realise  occupies nearly one half of the surface of the globe, had been, since the  first voyage of Magellan, crossed by many a vessel.    Notwithstanding, very little was known of the islands occupying its  central portion.    For this there were two reasons. First, the comparatively small area  covered by islands; secondly, the fact that nearly all who traversed it  had followed Magellan's track, or, if they started, as many did, from  Central America, they made straight for Magellan's discovery, the Ladrone  Islands. For this, again, there was a reason.    Few sailed for the purpose of exploration pure and simple; and even those  who started with that view found, when embarked on that vast expanse,  that prudence dictated that they should have a moderate certainty of, by  a certain time, falling in with a place of sure refreshment. The  provisions they carried were bad at starting, and by the time they had  fought their way through the Straits of Magellan were already worse;  water was limited, and would not hold out more than a given number of  days. Every voyage that is pursued tells the same story--short of water,  and eagerly looking out for an opportunity of replenishing it. The winds  were found to blow in fixed directions, and each voyager was fearful of  deviating from the track on which it was known they would be fair, for  fear of delays. And ever present in each captain's mind was the dread of  the terrible scourge, scurvy. Every expedition suffered from it. Each  hoped they would be exempt, and each in turn was reduced to impotence  from its effects.    It was the great consideration for every leader of a protracted  expedition, How can I obviate this paralyzing influence? And one after  another had to confess his failure.    It is yearly becoming more difficult for us to realise these obstacles.    The prevailing winds and currents in each part of the ocean are well  known to us: the exact distance and bearing from one point to another are  laid down in the chart; steam bridges over calm areas, and in many cases  conducts us on our entire journey at a speed but little inferior to that  of land travelling by railroad; modern science preserves fresh and  palatable food for an indefinite period; and, in a word, all the  difficulties and most of the dangers of long voyages have disappeared.    Take one element alone in long voyages--the time required. The average  progress of a ship in the eighteenth century was not more than fifty  miles a day. Nowadays we may expect as much as four hundred miles in a  full powered steamer, and not less than one hundred and fifty in a  well-fitted sailing ship.    But navigation, and more especially the navigation of the unknown  Pacific, was very different in Cook's days, when all the obstacles above  mentioned impeded the explorers, and impelled them to follow a common  track.    There were a few who had deviated from the common track.    The Spaniards, Mendana, Quiros, Torres, in the latter part of the  sixteenth century, starting first from their colonies in Peru, had  ventured along the central line of the Pacific, discovering the  Marquesas, certain small coral islands, the Northern New Hebrides, and  the Solomon Islands; but their voyages, mainly for fear of Drake and his  successors, were kept so secret that no one quite knew where these  islands lay.    Abel Tasman, in 1642, coming across the Indian Ocean from the westward,  had touched at Tasmania, or, as he called it, Van Diemen's Land, had  skirted the western coast of the north island of New Zealand without  landing, and had stretched away to the north-east, and found the Tonga  Group.    The English Buccaneers were not among these discoverers; Dampier, Woods  Rogers, and others, all went from Acapulco to the Ladrones, looking out  for the valuable Spanish galleons from  Manila, and they added little or nothing to the knowledge of the Pacific  and what it contained.    It was not therefore strange that the imagination of geographers ran riot  amongst the great unknown areas. They were impressed, as they looked at  the globes of the day, with the fact that, while the northern hemisphere  contained much land, the southern showed either water or blank spaces;  and starting with the ill-founded idea that the solid land in either  hemisphere should balance, they conceived that there must be a great  unknown continent in the southern part of the Pacific to make up the  deficiency. This was generally designated Terra Australis Incognita, and  many is the ancient chart that shows it, sketched with a free and  uncontrolled hand, around the South Pole. It was held by many that Tasman  had touched it in New Zealand; that Quiros had seen it near his island of  Encarnacion, and again at Espiritu Santo (New Hebrides), but no one had  been to see.    In George III's reign the desire to know more of this unknown ocean arose  in England. The king himself took great interest in it, and for the first  time since Queen Elizabeth's age, when Davis, Frobisher, Drake,  Narborough, and others, had gone on voyages of discovery, the pursuit was  renewed.    In 1764 the Dolphin and Tamor, under the command of Commodore Byron and  Captain Mouat, sailed on a voyage round the world. They spent some time,  as ordered, in exploring the Falkland Islands, and, after a two months'  passage through Magellan Strait, they stood across the Pacific. They,  however, also followed near the well-beaten track, and passing north of  the Paumotus, of which they sighted a few small islands, they too made  for the Ladrones. As usual, they suffered much from scurvy, and the one  idea was to get to a known place to recover. Byron returned in May 1766,  having added but little to the knowledge of the Pacific, and the Dolphin  was again sent in the August of the same year, with the Swallow, under  the command of Captains Wallis and Carteret, on a similar voyage.    They did somewhat better. After the usual struggle through the long and  narrow Strait of Magellan, against the strong and contrary winds that  continually blow, and which occupied four months, they got into the  Pacific.    As they passed out they separated, the Dolphin outsailing the Swallow,  and a dispassionate reader cannot well escape the conclusion that the  senior officers unnecessarily parted company.    The Dolphin kept a little south of the usual route, fell in with some of  the Paumotu Group, and finally discovered Tahiti, where she anchored at  Royal Bay, after grounding on a reef at its entrance, with her people, as  usual, decimated by scurvy. They were almost immediately attacked by the  natives, who, however, received such a reception that they speedily made  friends, and fast friends too. The remainder of the month of the Dolphin  stay was marked with the most friendly intercourse, and she sailed with a  high opinion of Tahiti and the Tahitians; the Queen, Cook's Obereia,  being especially well disposed to them. Their communication with the  natives must, however, have been limited, as they"]]]
