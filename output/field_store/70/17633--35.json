In the form of fritters, or farces, or in soups, it is  frequently brought to table in all the southern parts of Europe, and  forms a pleasant variety of esculent.--Ibid.    _Vinegar Made From Black Ants._    It is singular enough, that a discovery of modern chemistry should long  have been practically employed in some parts of Norway, for the purpose  of making vinegar from a large species of black ant. The method employed  in Norlanden is simply this: they first collect a sufficient quantity of  these little animals, by plunging a bottle partly filled with water up  to the neck in one of the large ant-hills; into which they naturally  creep, and are drowned. The contents are then boiled together, and the  acid thus produced is made use of by the inhabitants as _vinegar_, being  strong and good.    _Soil For Fruit Trees._    Low grounds that form the banks of rivers are, of all others, the best  adapted for the growth of fruit trees; the alluvial soil of which they  are composed, being an intermixture of the richest and most soluble  parts of the neighbouring lands, with a portion of animal and vegetable  matter, affording an inexhaustible store of nourishment--_Trans.

Instead of  encumbering a watch designed to be worn in the pocket with the striking  apparatus, (by which it would be increased to double the ordinary  thickness), this ingenious invention has the alarum or striking part  detached, and forming a bed on which the watch is to be laid; a  communication being made by a lever, projecting through the watch case,  to connect the works. This appendage is described to be applicable to  any watch of the usual construction, and is by no means expensive.           *       *       *       *       *      THE MONTHS.    [Illustration]    NOVEMBER.      November is associated with gloom, inasmuch as its days and nights are,  for the most part, sullen and sad. But the transition to this gloom is  slow, gradual, and almost imperceptible. The mornings of the month are  generally foggy, and are thus described by a modern poet:--     \"Not pleasureless the morn, when dismal fog    Rolls o'er the dewy plain, or thin mist drives;    When the lone timber's saturated branch    Drips freely.\"    In the progress of day,     \"Shorn of his glory through the dim profound,    With melancholy aspect looks the orb    Of stifled day, and while he strives to pierce    And dissipate the slow reluctant gloom,    Seems but a rayless globe, an autumn moon,    That gilds opaque the purple zone of eve,    And yet distributes of her thrifty beam.    Lo! now he conquers; now, subdued awhile,    Awhile subduing, the departed mist    Yields in a brighter beam, or darker clouds    His crimson disk obscure.\"    The country has now exchanged its refreshing varieties of greens for the  hues of saffron, russet, and dark brown. \"The trees,\" says an amusing  observer of nature, \"generally lose their leaves in the following  succession:--walnut, mulberry, horse-chestnut, sycamore, lime, ash,  then, after an interval, elm:      \"----'To him who walks    Now in the sheltered mead, loud roars above,    Among the naked branches of the elm,    Still freshening as the hurried cloud departs,    The strong Atlantic gale.'    \"Then beech and oak, then apple and peach trees, sometimes not till the  end of November; and lastly, pollard-oaks and young beeches, which  retain their withered leaves till pushed off by the new ones in spring.\"    The rural economy of the month is thus described by the same  writer:--\"The farmer endeavours to finish his ploughing this month, and  then lays up his instruments for the spring. Cattle are kept in the yard  or stable, sheep turned into the turnip-field, or in bad weather fed  with hay, bees moved under shelter, and pigeons fed in the dove-house.\"    The gardens, for the most part, begin to show the wear of desolation,  and but little of their floral pride remains without doors. Meanwhile, a  mimic garden is displayed within, and the hyacinth, narcissus, &c. are  assembled there to gladden us with anticipations of the coming spring.    Though sombre and drear, a November day is a _carnival_ for the  reflective observer; the very falling of the leaves, intercepted in  their descent by a little whirl or hurricane, is to him a feast of  meditation, and \"the soul, dissolving, as it were, into a spirit of  melancholy enthusiasm, acknowledges that silent pathos, which governs  without subduing the heart.\"--\"This season, so sacred to the enthusiast,  has been, in all ages, selected by the poet and the moralist, as a theme  for poetic description and moral reflection;\" and we may add that amidst  such scenes, Newton drew the most glorious problem of his philosophy,  and Bishop Horne his simple but pathetic lines on the \"Fall of the  Leaf,\"--lessons of nature which will still find their way to the hearts  of mankind, when the more subtle workings of speculative philosophy  shall be forgotten with their promoters.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      THE ROBBER SPATOLINO.      The history of Spatolino exhibits rather the character of a man bred  where men are in a state of nature, than of one born in the midst of an  old European state. This extraordinary character, furiously irritated  against the French, who had invaded Italy, desperately bent himself upon  revenge, and directed his attacks unceasingly upon their battalions. He  might perhaps have become a great general, had he entered the military  profession: had he received a competent education, he might have been a  virtuous and eminent citizen. His first crime was an act of vengeance,  and all his following delinquencies flowed from the same source. An  enthusiastic feeling placed the blade in his hand against the invaders  of the Roman States, and a superior sagacity aided his terrible  energies. He died stigmatised with the titles of brigand and assassin;  but the French, on whom he had exercised the most striking acts of  revenge, were his judges, his accusers, and executioners. In all his  acts the man of courage could be distinguished, finding resources, in  whatever dangers, in his own genius. He never was a traitor himself,  although often betrayed by his most intimate friends. His vindictive  exploits were prompt and terrible. The French greatly dreaded him. His  life presents traits truly romantic; sometimes they may appear  exaggerated; but his history is from an authentic source, and from his  voluntary confession.    The reader may wish to know something of the person of Spatolino. He was  of low stature, long visage, fair skin, but his face of an olive pale  hue; his eyes of a light blue, and full of animation; his aspect fierce;  hair light; long whiskers; lips pale; broad back; swift of foot; and  particularly animated in his action. He wore a jerkin lined with red, a  dark yellow waistcoat, blue breeches, a breast-pouch with fifty  cartridges, four pistols, and a small hanger by his side. In his  breeches-pocket he kept a small stiletto. He also bore a long gun. On  his head he wore continually a net, and upon that his hat. His wife  followed him in all his excursions, and he greatly esteemed and loved  her. He remained some time in the mountains near Rome, and with his  associates laid in a store of whatever was necessary for their new  avocation. He then resolved upon proceeding to Sonnino, the common  rendezvous of the greater part of the banditti in the papal states. In  Sonnino he found some followers, who, going deeply into his notions, did  not scruple to join him. They swore to entertain an eternal friendship  for each other, implacable hatred against the French, and laid it down  as a duty to rob and kill them. Spatolino, before commencing his career  as brigand, repaired to the curate of Sonnino, and requested absolution  for all the crimes he had or might commit; the curate, surprised at this  request, observed to him, that absolution was only given after sins were  committed. Spatolino very soon quieted the scruples of the curate, by  making him a present of a very handsome watch; upon which he immediately  raised his hands and gave him the desired absolution. Sonnino may be  compared with Pontus, where Ovid was in exile, and which is thus  described by that celebrated author:--\"The men I meet with are not even  worthy of the name; they are more fierce than wolves; have no laws, as  with them armed force constitutes justice, and injury rights. They live  by rapine, but seek it not without peril, and sword in hand. Every other  way of purveying for their necessities they view as base and  ignominious. It is enough for them to be seen to be hated and dreaded.  The sound of their voice is ferocious; their physiognomy horrible, and  their complexion cadaverous.\" Just such are the inhabitants of Sonnino  and its vicinity at present, and among such Spatolino came to complete  his band, which, when formed in Rome, consisted of seven only.    Before proceeding on his expedition, and to attach his wife more closely  to his person by proving his strong affection, he left his band and  proceeded to Civita Vecchia, and seeking a sailor who had seduced her,  he expressed a wish to speak with him a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#4)"],[1,"glass  was illustrated by a description of the doublet of Steinheil, the parent  of the large family of rapid doublets now known under various names. The  effect of thickness of lenses was shown by a diagram of the ingenious  method of Mr. F. Wenham, who had long ago by this means corrected  spherical aberration in microscopic objective. The construction of  portrait lenses was next gone into, the influence of the negative  element of the back lens being especially noted. A method was then  referred to of making a rapid portrait lens cover a very large angle by  pivoting at its optical center and traversing the plate in the manner of  the pantoscopic camera.

Ehrmann, Esq., for the improved formulas given  below as translated by him for the _Photographic Times_.    Dr. Eder has for a considerable time directed especial attention to the  soda and potash developers, either of which seems to offer certain  advantages over the ammoniacal pyrogallol. This advantage becomes  particularly apparent with emulsions prepared with ammonia, which  frequently show with ammoniacal developer green or red fog, or a fog of  clayish color by reflected, and of pale purple by transmitted light.  Ferrous oxalate works quite well with plates of that kind; so do soda  and potassa developers.    For soda developers, Eder uses a solution of 10 parts of pure  crystallized soda in 100 parts of water. For use, 100 c.c. of this  solution are mixed with 6 c.c. of a pyrogallic solution of 1:10, without  the addition of any bromide.    More pleasant to work with is Dr. Stolze's potassa developer. No. 1:  Water, 200 c.c.; chem. pure potassium carbonate, 90 gr.; sodium  sulphite, 25 gr. No. 2: Water 100 c.c.; citric, 11/2 gr.; sodium sulphite,  25 gr.; pyrogallol., 12 gr. Solution No. 2 is for its better keeping  qualities preferable to Dr. Stolze's solution.[A] The solutions when in  well stoppered bottles keep well for some time. To develop, mix 100 c.c.  of water with 40 min. of No. 1 and 50 min. of No. 2. The picture appears  quickly and more vigorously than with iron oxalate. If it is desirable  to decrease the density of the negatives, double the quantity of water.  The negatives have a greenish brown to olive-green tone. A very fine  grayish-black can be obtained by using a strong alum bath between  developing and fixing. The same bath after fixing does not act as  effectual in producing the desired tone. A bath of equal volumes of  saturated solutions of alum and ferrous sulphate gives the negative a  deep olive-brown color and an extraordinary intensity, which excludes  all possible necessities of an after intensification.    [Footnote A: 100 c.c. water; 10 c.c. alcohol; 10 gr. pyrogallol; 1 gr.  salicylic acid.]    The sensitiveness with this developer is at least equal to that when  iron developer is used, frequently even greater.    The addition of bromides is superfluous, sometimes injurious. Bromides  in quantities, as added to ammoniacal pyro, would reduce the  sensitiveness to 1/10 or 1/20; will even retard the developing power  almost entirely.    Must a restrainer be resorted to, 1 to 3 min. of a 1:10 solution of  potassium bromide is quite sufficient.           *       *       *       *       *          THE PREPARATION OF LARD FOR USE IN PHARMACY.    [Footnote: Read at an evening meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society of  Great Britain, November 7, 1883.]    By Professor REDWOOD.      I have read with much, interest the paper on \"Ointment Bases,\"  communicated by Mr. Willmott to the Pharmaceutical Conference at its  recent meeting, but the part of the subject which has more particularly  attracted my attention is that which relates to prepared lard. Reference  is made by Mr. Willmott to lard prepared in different ways, and it  appears from the results of his experiments that when made according to  the process of the British Pharmacopoeia it does not keep free from  rancidity for so long a time as some of the samples do which have been  otherwise prepared. The general tendency of the discussion, as far as  related to this part of the subject, seems to have been also in the same  direction; but neither in the paper nor in the discussion was the  question of the best mode of preparing lard for use in pharmacy so  specially referred to or fully discussed as I think it deserves to be.    When, in 1860, Mr. Hills, at a meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society,  suggested a process for the preparation of lard, which consisted in  removing from the \"flare\" all matter soluble in water, by first  thoroughly washing it in a stream of cold water after breaking up the  tissues and afterward melting and straining the fat at a moderate heat,  this method of operating seemed to be generally approved. It was adopted  by men largely engaged in \"rendering\" fatty substances for use in  pharmacy and for other purposes for which the fat was required to be as  free as possible from flavor and not unduly subject to become rancid. It  became the process of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1868. In 1869 it  formed the basis of a process, which was patented in Paris and this  country by Hippolite Mege, for the production of a fat free from taste  and odor, and suitable for dietetic use as a substitute for butter.  Mege's process consists in passing the fat between revolving rollers,  together with a stream of water, and then melting at \"animal heat.\" This  process has been used abroad in the production of the fatty substance  called oleomargarine.    But while there have been advocates for this process, of whom I have  been one, opinions have been now and then expressed to the effect that  the washing of the flare before melting the fat was rather hurtful than  beneficial. I have reason to believe that this opinion has been gaining  ground among those who have carefully inquired into the properties of  the products obtained by the various methods which have been suggested  for obtaining animal fat in its greatest state of purity.    I have had occasion during the last two or three years to make many  experiments on the rendering and purification of animal fat, and at the  same time have been brought into communication with manufacturers of  oleomargarine on the large scale; the result of which experience has  been that I have lost faith in the efficacy of the Pharmacopeia process.  I have found that in the method now generally adopted by manufacturers  of oleomargarine, which is produced in immense quantities, the use of  water, for washing the fat before melting it, is not only omitted but  specially avoided. The parts of the process to which most importance is  attached are: First, the selection of fresh and perfectly sweet natural  fat, which is hung up and freely exposed to air and light. It thus  becomes dried and freed from an odor which is present in the freshly  slaughtered carcass. It is then carefully examined, and adhering  portions of flesh or membrane as far as possible removed; after which it  is cut up and passed through a machine in which it is mashed so as to  completely break up the membraneous vesicles in which the fat is  inclosed. The magma thus produced is put into a deep jacketed pan heated  by warm water, and the fat is melted at a temperature not exceeding  130 deg.F.    If the flare has been very effectually mashed, the fat may be easily  melted away from the membraneous matter at 120 deg.F., or even below that,  and no further continuance of the heat is required beyond what is  necessary for effecting a separation of the melted fat from the  membraneous or other suspended matter. Complete separation of all  suspended matter is obviously important, and therefore nitration seems  desirable, where practicable; which however is not on the large scale.    My experiments tend to indicate that the process just described is that  best adapted for the preparation of lard for use in pharmacy. There is,  however, a point connected with this or any other method of preparing  lard which is deserving of more attention than it has, I believe,  usually received, and that is, the source from which the flare has been  derived. Everybody knows how greatly the quality of pork depends upon  the manner in which the pig has been fed, and this applies to the fat as  well as other parts of the animal. Some time ago I had some pork  submitted to me for the expression of opinion upon it, which had a  decided fishy flavor, both in taste and smell. This flavor was present  in every part, fat and lean, and it is obvious that lard prepared from  that fat would not be fit for use in pharmacy. The pig had been  prescribed a fish diet. Barley meal would, no doubt, have produced a  better variety of lard.           *       *       *       *       *          ANTI-CORROSION PAINT.      The _Neueste Erfinderung_ describes an anti-corrosion paint for iron. It  states that if 10 per cent. of burnt magnesia, or even baryta, or  strontia, is mixed (cold) with ordinary linseed-oil paint, and then  enough mineral oil to envelop the alkaline earth, the free acid of the  paint will be neutralized, while the iron will be protected by the  permanent alkaline action of the paint. Iron to be buried in damp earth  may be painted with a mixture of 100 parts of resin (colophony), 25  parts of gutta-percha, and 50 parts of paraffin, to which 20 parts of  magnesia and some mineral oil have been added.           *       *       *       *       *          CARBON IN STEEL.
