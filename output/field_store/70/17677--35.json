[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#4)"],[1,"was his philosophy of life. He was range-bred--as purely Western  as were the cattle he tended--but he was not altogether ignorant of  the ways of the world, past or present. He had that smattering of  education which country schools and those of \"the county seat\" may  give a boy who loves a horse better than books, and who, sitting  hunched behind his geography, dreams of riding afar, of shooting wild  things and of sleeping under the stars.    From the time he was sixteen he had lived chiefly in tents and  line-camp cabins, his world the land of far horizons, of big sins, and  virtues bigger. One creed he owned: to live \"square,\" fight square,  and to be loyal to his friends and his \"outfit.\" Little things did  not count much with him, and for that reason he was the more enraged  against the Pilgrim, because he did not quite know what it was all  about. So far as he had heard or seen, the Pilgrim had offered no  insult to Miss Bridger--\"the girl,\" as he called her simply in  his mind. Still, he had felt all along that the mere presence of the  Pilgrim was an offense to her, no less real because it was intangible  and not to be put into words; and for that offense the Pilgrim must  pay.    But for the presence of the Pilgrim, he told himself ill-temperedly,  they might have waited for breakfast; but he had been so anxious to  get her away from under the man's leering gaze that he had not thought  of eating. And if the Pilgrim had been a _man_, he might have sent him  over to Bridger's for her father and a horse. But the Pilgrim would  have lost himself, or have refused to go, and the latter possibility  would have caused a scene unfit for the eyes of a young woman.    So he rode slowly and thought of many things he might have done which  would have been better than what he did do; and wondered what the  girl thought about it and if she blamed him for not doing something  different. And for every mile of the way he cursed the Pilgrim anew.    In that unfriendly mood he opened the door of the cabin, stood a  minute just inside, then closed it after him with a slam. The cabin,  in contrast with the bright light of sun shining on new-fallen snow,  was dark and so utterly cheerless and chill that he shrugged shoulders  impatiently at its atmosphere, which was as intangibly offensive as  had been the conduct of the Pilgrim.    The Pilgrim was sprawled upon the bunk with his face in his arms,  snoring in a peculiarly rasping way that Billy, heavy-eyed as he was,  resented most unreasonably. Also, the untidy table showed that the  Pilgrim had eaten unstintedly--and Billy was exceedingly hungry.  He went over and lifted a snowy boot to the ribs of the sleeper and  commanded him bluntly to \"Come alive.\"    \"What-yuh-want?\" mumbled the Pilgrim thickly, making one word of the  three and lifting his red-rimmed eyes to the other. He raised to an  elbow with a lazy doubling of his body and stared dully for a space  before he grinned unpleasantly. \"Took 'er home all right, did yuh?\" he  leered, as if they two were in possession of a huge joke of the kind  which may not be told in mixed company.    If Charming Billy Boyle had needed anything more to stir him to the  fighting point, that one sentence admirably supplied the lack. \"Yuh  low-down skunk!\" he cried, and struck him full upon the insulting,  smiling mouth. \"If I was as rotten-minded as you are, I'd go drown  myself in the stalest alkali hole I could find. I dunno why I'm  dirtying my hands on yuh--yuh ain't fit to be clubbed to death with a  tent pole!\" He was, however, using his hands freely and to very good  purpose, probably feeling that, since the Pilgrim was much bigger than  he, there was need of getting a good start.    But the Pilgrim was not the sort to lie on his bunk and take a  thrashing. He came up after the second blow, pushing Billy back with  the very weight of his body, and they were fighting all over the  little cabin, surging against the walls and the table and knocking the  coffee-pot off the stove as they lurched this way and that. Not much  was said after the first outburst of Billy's, save a panting curse now  and then between blows, a threat gasped while they wrestled.    It was the dog, sneaking panther-like behind Billy and setting  treacherous teeth viciously into his leathern chaps, that brought the  crisis. Billy tore loose and snatched his gun from the scabbard at his  hip, held the Pilgrim momentarily at bay with one hand while he took a  shot at the dog, missed, kicked him back from another rush, and turned  again on the Pilgrim.    \"Get that dawg outdoors, then,\" he panted, \"or I'll kill him sure.\"  The Pilgrim, for answer, struck a blow that staggered Billy, and tried  to grab the gun. Billy, hooking a foot around a table-leg, threw it  between them, swept the blood from his eyes and turned his gun once  more on the dog that was watching treacherously for another chance.    \"That's the time I got him,\" he gritted through the smoke, holding  the Pilgrim quiet before him with the gun. \"But I've got a heap more  respect for him than I have for you, yuh damn', low-down brute. I'd  ought to kill yuh like I would a coyote. Yuh throw your traps together  and light out uh here, before I forget and shoot yuh up. There ain't  room in this camp for you and me no more.\"    The Pilgrim backed, eying Billy malevolently. \"I never done nothing,\"  he defended sullenly. \"The boss'll have something to say about  this--and I'll kill you first chance I get, for shooting my dog.\"    \"It ain't what yuh done, it's what yuh woulda done if you'd had the  chance,\" answered Billy, for the first time finding words for what was  surging bitterly in the heart of him. \"And I'm willing to take a whirl  with yuh any old time; any dawg that'll lick the boots of a man like  you had ought to be shot for not having more sense. I ain't saying  anything about him biting me--which I'd kill him for, anyhow. Now,  git! I want my breakfast, and I can't eat with any relish whilst  you're spoiling the air in here for me.\"    At heart the Pilgrim was a coward as well as a beast, and he packed  his few belongings hurriedly and started for the door.    \"Come back here, and drag your dawg outside,\" commanded Billy, and the  Pilgrim obeyed.    \"You'll hear about this later on,\" he snarled. \"The boss won't stand  for anything like this. I never done a thing, and I'm going to tell  him so.\"    \"Aw, go on and tell him, yuh--!\" snapped Billy. \"Only yuh don't want  to get absent-minded enough to come back--not whilst I'm here; things  unpleasant might happen.\" He stood in the doorway and watched while  the Pilgrim saddled his horse and rode away. When not even the  pluckety-pluck of his horse's feet came back to offend the ears of  him, Charming Billy put away his gun and went in and hoisted the  overturned table upon its legs again. A coarse, earthenware plate,  which the Pilgrim had used for his breakfast, lay unbroken at the feet  of him. Billy picked it up, went to the door and cast it violently  forth, watching with grim satisfaction the pieces when they scattered  over the frozen ground. \"No white man'll ever have to eat after  _him_,\" he muttered. To ease his outraged feelings still farther,  he picked up the Pilgrim's knife and fork, and sent them after the  plate--and knives and forks were not numerous in that particular  camp, either. After that he felt better and picked up the coffee-pot,  lighted a fire and cooked himself some breakfast, which he ate  hungrily, his wrath cooling a bit with the cheer of warm food and  strong coffee.    The routine work of the line-camp was performed in a hurried,  perfunctory manner that day. Charming Billy, riding the high-lines  to make sure the cattle had not drifted where they should not, was  vaguely ill at ease. He told himself it was the want of a smoke that  made him uncomfortable, and he planned a hurried trip to Hardup, if  the weather held good for another day, when he would lay in a supply  of tobacco and papers that would last till roundup. This running out  every two or three weeks, and living in hell till you got more, was  plumb wearisome and unnecessary.    On the way back, his trail crossed that of a breed wolfer on his way  into the Bad Lands. Billy immediately asked for tobacco, and the breed  somewhat reluctantly opened his pack and exchanged two small sacks for  a two-bit piece. Billy, rolling a cigarette with eager fingers,  felt for the moment a deep satisfaction with life. He even felt some  compunction about killing the Pilgrim's dog, when he passed the body  stiffening on the snow. \"Poor devil! Yuh hadn't ought to expect much  from a dawg--and he was a heap more white-acting than what his owner  was,\" was his tribute to the dead.    It seemed as though, when he closed the cabin door behind him, he  somehow shut out his newborn satisfaction. \"A shack with one window is  sure unpleasant when the sun is shining outside,\" he said fretfully  to himself. \"This joint looks a heap like a cellar. I wonder what the  girl thought of it; I reckon it looked pretty sousy, to her--and them  with everything shining. Oh, hell!\" He took off his chaps and his  spurs, rolled another cigarette and smoked it meditatively. When it  had burned down so that it came near scorching his lips, he lighted a  fire, carried water from the creek, filled the dishpan and set it  on the stove to heat. \"Darn a dirty shack!\" he muttered, half  apologetically, while he was taking the accumulation of ashes out of  the hearth.    For the rest of that day he was exceedingly busy, and he did not  attempt further explanations to himself. He overhauled the bunk  and spread the blankets out on the wild rose bushes to sun while  he cleaned the floor. Billy's way of cleaning the floor was  characteristic of the man, and calculated to be effectual in the main  without descending to petty details. All superfluous objects that  were small enough, he merely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#4)"],[1,"would  never behold it. Only by toil, sweat, endurance and pain could any  man ever look at Nonnezoshe. It seemed well to realize that the great  things of life had to be earned. Nonnezoshe would always be alone,  grand, silent, beautiful, unintelligible; and as such I bade it a  mute, reverent farewell.          CHAPTER II      COLORADO TRAILS    Riding and tramping trails would lose half their charm if the motive  were only to hunt and to fish. It seems fair to warn the reader who  longs to embark upon a bloody game hunt or a chronicle of fishing  records that this is not that kind of story. But it will be one for  those who love horses and dogs, the long winding dim trails, the wild  flowers and the dark still woods, the fragrance of spruce and the  smell of camp-fire smoke. And as well for those who love to angle in  brown lakes or rushing brooks or chase after the baying hounds or  stalk the stag on his lonely heights.    [Illustration: PACK HORSES ON A SAGE SLOPE IN COLORADO]    We left Denver on August twenty-second over the Moffet road and had a  long wonderful ride through the mountains. The Rockies have a sweep, a  limitless sweep, majestic and grand. For many miles we crossed no  streams, and climbed and wound up barren slopes. Once across the divide,  however, we descended into a country of black forests and green valleys.  Yampa, a little hamlet with a past prosperity, lay in the wide valley of  the Bear River. It was picturesque but idle, and a better name for it  would have been Sleepy Hollow. The main and only street was very wide  and dusty, bordered by old board walks and vacant stores. It seemed a  deserted street of a deserted village. Teague, the guide, lived there.  He assured me it was not quite as lively a place as in the early days  when it was a stage center for an old and rich mining section. We stayed  there at the one hotel for a whole day, most of which I spent sitting on  the board walk. Whenever I chanced to look down the wide street it  seemed always the same--deserted. But Yampa had the charm of being old  and forgotten, and for that reason I would like to live there a while.    [Illustration: THE GRASSY UPLANDS, WITH WHITELEY'S PEAK IN THE  DISTANCE]    On August twenty-third we started in two buckboards for the foothills,  some fifteen miles westward, where Teague's men were to meet us with  saddle and pack horses. The ride was not interesting until the Flattop  Mountains began to loom, and we saw the dark green slopes of spruce,  rising to bare gray cliffs and domes, spotted with white banks of  snow. I felt the first cool breath of mountain air, exhilarating and  sweet. From that moment I began to live.    We had left at six-thirty. Teague, my guide, had been so rushed with  his manifold tasks that I had scarcely seen him, let alone gotten  acquainted with him. And on this ride he was far behind with our load  of baggage. We arrived at the edge of the foothills about noon. It  appeared to be the gateway of a valley, with aspen groves and ragged  jack-pines on the slopes, and a stream running down. Our driver called  it the Stillwater. That struck me as strange, for the stream was in  a great hurry. R.C. spied trout in it, and schools of darkish,  mullet-like fish which we were informed were grayling. We wished for  our tackle then and for time to fish.    Teague's man, a young fellow called Virgil, met us here. He did not  resemble the ancient Virgil in the least, but he did look as if he had  walked right out of one of my romances of wild riders. So I took a  liking to him at once.    But the bunch of horses he had corralled there did not excite any  delight in me. Horses, of course, were the most important part of our  outfit. And that moment of first seeing the horses that were to carry  us on such long rides was an anxious and thrilling one. I have felt  it many times, and it never grows any weaker from experience. Many a  scrubby lot of horses had turned out well upon acquaintance, and some  I had found hard to part with at the end of trips. Up to that time,  however, I had not seen a bear hunter's horses; and I was much  concerned by the fact that these were a sorry looking outfit, dusty,  ragged, maneless, cut and bruised and crippled. Still, I reflected,  they were bunched up so closely that I could not tell much about them,  and I decided to wait for Teague before I chose a horse for any one.    In an hour Teague trotted up to our resting place. Beside his own  mount he had two white saddle horses, and nine pack-animals, heavily  laden. Teague was a sturdy rugged man with bronzed face and keen  gray-blue eyes, very genial and humorous. Straightway I got the  impression that he liked work.    \"Let's organize,\" he said, briskly. \"Have you picked the horses you're  goin' to ride?\"    Teague led from the midst of that dusty kicking bunch a rangy powerful  horse, with four white feet, a white face and a noble head. He had  escaped my eye. I felt thrillingly that here at least was one horse.    The rest of the horses were permanently crippled or temporarily lame,  and I had no choice, except to take the one it would be kindest to  ride.    \"He ain't much like your Silvermane or Black Star,\" said Teague,  laughing.    \"What do you know about them?\" I asked, very much pleased at this from  him.    \"Well, I know all about them,\" he replied. \"I'll have you the best horse  in this country in a few days. Fact is I've bought him, an' he'll come  with my cowboy, Vern.... Now, we're organized. Let's move.\"    [Illustration: A SPRUCE-SHADED, FLOWER-SKIRTED LAKE]    [Illustration: LOOKING DOWN UPON CLOUD-FILLED VALLEYS]    [Illustration: SEARCHING BURNED-OVER RANGES FOR GAME]    We rode through a meadow along a spruce slope above which towered the  great mountain. It was a zigzag trail, rough, boggy, and steep in  places. The Stillwater meandered here, and little breaks on the water  gave evidence of feeding trout. We had several miles of meadow, and  then sheered off to the left up into the timber. It was a spruce  forest, very still and fragrant. We climbed out up on a bench, and  across a flat, up another bench, out of the timber into the patches of  snow. Here snow could be felt in the air. Water was everywhere. I saw  a fox, a badger, and another furry creature, too illusive to name. One  more climb brought us to the top of the Flattop Pass, about eleven  thousand feet. The view in the direction from which we had come was  splendid, and led the eye to the distant sweeping ranges, dark and dim  along the horizon. The Flattops were flat enough, but not very wide  at this pass, and we were soon going down again into a green gulf  of spruce, with ragged peaks lifting beyond. Here again I got the  suggestion of limitless space. It took us an hour to ride down to  Little Trappers Lake, a small clear green sheet of water. The larger  lake was farther down. It was big, irregular, and bordered by spruce  forests, and shadowed by the lofty gray peaks.    The Camp was on the far side. The air appeared rather warm, and  mosquitoes bothered us. However, they did not stay long. It was after  sunset and I was too tired to have many impressions.    Our cook appeared to be a melancholy man. He had a deep quavering  voice, a long drooping mustache and sad eyes. He was silent most of  the time. The men called him Bill, and yelled when they spoke, for he  was somewhat deaf. It did not take me long to discover that he was a  good cook.    Our tent was pitched down the slope from the cook tent. We were too  tired to sit round a camp-fire and talk. The stars were white and  splendid, and they hung over the flat ridges like great beacon lights.  The lake appeared to be inclosed on three sides by amphitheatric  mountains, black with spruce up to the gray walls of rock. The night  grew cold and very still. The bells on the horses tinkled distantly.  There was a soft murmur of falling water. A lonesome coyote barked,  and that thrilled me. Teague's dogs answered this prowler, and some of  them had voices to make a hunter thrill. One, the bloodhound Cain, had  a roar like a lion's. I had not gotten acquainted with the hounds, and  I was thinking about them when I fell asleep.    Next morning I was up at five-thirty. The air was cold and nipping and  frost shone on grass and sage. A red glow of sunrise gleamed on the  tip of the mountain and slowly grew downward.    The cool handle of an axe felt good. I soon found, however, that I  could not wield it long for lack of breath. The elevation was close to  ten thousand feet and the air at that height was thin and rare. After  each series of lusty strokes I had to rest. R.C., who could handle  an axe as he used to swing a baseball bat, made fun of my efforts.  Whereupon I relinquished the tool to him, and chuckled at his  discomfiture.    After breakfast R.C. and I got out our tackles and rigged up fly rods,  and sallied forth to the lake with the same eagerness we had felt when  we were boys going after chubs and sunfish. The lake glistened green  in the sunlight and it lay like a gem at the foot of the magnificent  black slopes.    The water was full of little floating particles that Teague called  wild rice. I thought the lake had begun to work, like eastern lakes  during dog days. It did not look propitious for fishing, but Teague  reassured us. The outlet of this lake was the head of White River. We  tried the outlet first, but trout were not rising there. Then we  began wading and casting along a shallow bar of the lake. Teague had  instructed us to cast, then drag the flies slowly across the surface  of the water, in imitation of a swimming fly or bug. I tried this, and  several times, when the leader was close to me and my rod far back, I  had strikes. With my rod in that position I could not hook the trout.  Then I cast my own way, letting the flies sink a little. To my  surprise and dismay I had only a few strikes and could not hook the"]]]
