[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#4)"],[1," in  peaceable and friendly sort, Love has constrained me to take from you in  this high-handed fashion and by force of arms; to whom I mean to be even  such as would have been your Pasimondas: wherefore give her to me, and go  your way, and God's grace go with you.\"    Yielding rather to force than prompted by generosity, the Rhodians  surrendered Iphigenia, all tears, to Cimon; who, marking her tears, said  to her:--\"Grieve not, noble lady; thy Cimon am I, who, by my long love,  have established a far better right to thee than Pasimondas by the faith  that was plighted to him.\" So saying, he sent her aboard his ship,  whither he followed her, touching nought that belonged to the Rhodians,  and suffering them to go their way. To have gotten so dear a prize made  him the happiest man in the world, but for a time 'twas all he could do  to assuage her grief: then, after taking counsel with his comrades, he  deemed it best not to return to Cyprus for the present: and so, by common  consent they shaped their course for Crete, where most of them, and  especially Cimon, had alliances of old or recent date, and friends not a  few, whereby they deemed that there they might tarry with Iphigenia in  security. But Fortune, that had accorded Cimon so gladsome a capture of  the lady, suddenly proved fickle, and converted the boundless joy of the  enamoured gallant into woeful and bitter lamentation. 'Twas not yet full  four hours since Cimon had parted from the Rhodians, when with the  approach of night, that night from which Cimon hoped such joyance as he  had never known, came weather most turbulent and tempestuous, which  wrapped the heavens in cloud, and swept the sea with scathing blasts;  whereby 'twas not possible for any to see how the ship was to be worked  or steered, or to steady himself so as to do any duty upon her deck.  Whereat what grief was Cimon's, it boots not to ask. Indeed it seemed to  him that the gods had granted his heart's desire only that it might be  harder for him to die, which had else been to him but a light matter. Not  less downcast were his comrades; but most of all Iphigenia, who, weeping  bitterly and shuddering at every wave that struck the ship, did cruelly  curse Cimon's love and censure his rashness, averring that this tempest  was come upon them for no other cause than that the gods had decreed,  that, as 'twas in despite of their will that he purposed to espouse her,  he should be frustrate of his presumptuous intent, and having lived to  see her expire, should then himself meet a woeful death.    While thus and yet more bitterly they bewailed them, and the mariners  were at their wits' end, as the gale grew hourly more violent, nor knew  they, nor might conjecture, whither they went, they drew nigh the island  of Rhodes, albeit that Rhodes it was they wist not, and set themselves,  as best and most skilfully they might, to run the ship aground. In which  enterprise Fortune favoured them, bringing them into a little bay, where,  shortly before them, was arrived the Rhodian ship that Cimon had let go.  Nor were they sooner ware that 'twas Rhodes they had made, than day  broke, and, the sky thus brightening a little, they saw that they were  about a bow-shot from the ship that they had released on the preceding  day. Whereupon Cimon, vexed beyond measure, being apprehensive of that  which in fact befell them, bade make every effort to win out of the bay,  and let Fortune carry them whither she would, for nowhere might they be  in worse plight than there. So might and main they strove to bring the  ship out, but all in vain: the violence of the gale thwarted them to such  purpose as not only to preclude their passage out of the bay but to drive  them, willing nilling, ashore. Whither no sooner were they come, than  they were recognized by the Rhodian mariners, who were already landed. Of  whom one ran with all speed to a farm hard by, whither the Rhodian  gallants were gone, and told them that Fortune had brought Cimon and  Iphigenia aboard their ship into the same bay to which she had guided  them. Whereat the gallants were overjoyed, and taking with them not a few  of the farm-servants, hied them in hot haste to the shore, where, Cimon  and his men being already landed with intent to take refuge in a  neighbouring wood, they took them all (with Iphigenia) and brought them  to the farm. Whence, pursuant to an order of the Senate of Rhodes, to  which, so soon as he received the news, Pasimondas made his complaint,  Cimon and his men were all marched off to prison by Lysimachus, chief  magistrate of the Rhodians for that year, who came down from the city for  the purpose with an exceeding great company of men at arms. On such wise  did our hapless and enamoured Cimon lose his so lately won Iphigenia  before he had had of her more than a kiss or two. Iphigenia was  entertained and comforted of the annoy, occasioned as well by her recent  capture as by the fury of the sea, by not a few noble ladies of Rhodes,  with whom she tarried until the day appointed for her marriage. In  recompense of the release of the Rhodian gallants on the preceding day  the lives of Cimon and his men were spared, notwithstanding that  Pasimondas pressed might and main for their execution; and instead they  were condemned to perpetual imprisonment: wherein, as may be supposed,  they abode in dolorous plight, and despaired of ever again knowing  happiness.    However, it so befell that, Pasimondas accelerating his nuptials to the  best of his power, Fortune, as if repenting her that in her haste she had  done Cimon so evil a turn, did now by a fresh disposition of events  compass his deliverance. Pasimondas had a brother, by name Hormisdas, his  equal in all respects save in years, who had long been contract to marry  Cassandra, a fair and noble damsel of Rhodes, of whom Lysimachus was in  the last degree enamoured; but owing to divers accidents the marriage had  been from time to time put off. Now Pasimondas, being about to celebrate  his nuptials with exceeding great pomp, bethought him that he could not  do better than, to avoid a repetition of the pomp and expense, arrange,  if so he might, that his brother should be wedded on the same day with  himself. So, having consulted anew with Cassandra's kinsfolk, and come to  an understanding with them, he and his brother and they conferred  together, and agreed that on the same day that Pasimondas married  Iphigenia, Hormisdas should marry Cassandra. Lysimachus, getting wind of  this arrangement, was mortified beyond measure, seeing himself thereby  deprived of the hope which he cherished of marrying Cassandra himself, if  Hormisdas should not forestall him. But like a wise man he concealed his  chagrin, and cast about how he might frustrate the arrangement: to which  end he saw no other possible means but to carry Cassandra off. It did not  escape him that the office which he held would render this easily  feasible, but he deemed it all the more dishonourable than if he had not  held the office; but, in short, after much pondering, honour yielded  place to love, and he made up his mind that, come what might, he would  carry Cassandra off. Then, as he took thought what company he should take  with him, and how he should go about the affair, he remembered Cimon,  whom he had in prison with his men, and it occurred to him that he could  not possibly have a better or more trusty associate in such an enterprise  than Cimon. Wherefore the same night he caused Cimon to be brought  privily to him in his own room, and thus addressed him:--\"Cimon, as the  gods are most generous and liberal to bestow their gifts on men, so are  they also most sagacious to try their virtue; and those whom they find to  be firm and steadfast in all circumstances they honour, as the most  worthy, with the highest rewards. They have been minded to be certified  of thy worth by better proofs than thou couldst afford them, as long as  thy life was bounded by thy father's house amid the superabundant wealth  which I know him to possess: wherefore in the first place they so wrought  upon thee with the shrewd incitements of Love that from an insensate  brute, as I have heard, thou grewest to be a man; since when, it has been  and is their intent to try whether evil fortune and harsh imprisonment  may avail to change thee from the temper that was thine when for a short  while thou hadst joyance of the prize thou hadst won. And so thou prove  the same that thou wast then, they have in store for thee a boon  incomparably greater than aught that they vouchsafed thee before: what  that boon is, to the end thou mayst recover heart and thy wonted  energies, I will now explain to thee. Pasimondas, exultant in thy  misfortune and eager to compass thy death, hastens to the best of his  power his nuptials with thy Iphigenia; that so he may enjoy the prize  that Fortune, erstwhile smiling, gave thee, and forthwith, frowning, reft  from thee. Whereat how sore must be thy grief, if rightly I gauge thy  love, I know by my own case, seeing that his brother Hormisdas addresses  himself to do me on the same day a like wrong in regard of Cassandra,  whom I love more than aught else in the world. Nor see I that Fortune has  left us any way of escape from this her unjust and cruel spite, save what  we may make for ourselves by a resolved spirit and the might of our right  hands: take we then the sword, and therewith make we, each, prize of his  lady, thou for the second, I for the first time: for so thou value the  recovery, I say not of thy liberty, for without thy lady I doubt thou  wouldst hold it cheap, but of thy lady, the gods have placed it in thine  own hands, if thou art but minded to join me in my enterprise.\"    These words restored to Cimon all that he had lost of heart and hope, nor  pondered he long, before he replied:--\"Lysimachus, comrade stouter or  more staunch than I thou mightst not have in such an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13111"],[0,"The Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song (#4)"],[1,"spine can be seen, and the slope of the surface of the ribs is shown, so  that when elevation and rotation occur the chest will be increased in  diameter laterally.]    [Illustration: FIG 3]    [Description: FIG 3.--Diagram after Barth to illustrate the changes in the  diaphragm, the chest, and abdomen in ordinary inspiration _b-b_', and  expiration _a-a_', and in voluntary inspiration _d-d_' and expiration  _c-c_', for vocalisation In normal breathing the position of the chest and  abdomen in inspiration and expiration is represented respectively by the  lines _b_ and _a_; the position of the diaphragm is represented by _b_' and  _a_'. In breathing for vocalisation the position of the chest and abdomen  is represented by the lines _d_ and _e_, and the diaphragm by _d_' and  _c_'; it will be observed that in voluntary costal breathing _d-d_ the  expansion of the chest is much greater and also the diaphragm _d_' sinks  deeper, but by the contraction of the abdominal muscles the protrusion of  the belly wall _d_ is much less than in normal breathing _b_.]    A glance at the diagram (fig. 3) shows the changes in the shape of the  thorax in normal subconscious automatic breathing, and the changes in the  voluntary conscious breathing of vocalisation. It will be observed that  there are marked differences: when voluntary control is exercised, the  expansion of the chest is greater in all directions; moreover, by voluntary  conscious effort the contraction of the chest is much greater in all  directions; the result is that a larger amount of air can be taken into the  bellows and a larger amount expelled. The mind can therefore bring into  play at will more muscular forces, and so control and regulate those forces  as to produce infinite variations in the pressure of the air in the  sound-pipe of the vocal instrument. But the forces which tend to contract  the chest and drive the air out of the lungs would be ineffective if there  were not simultaneously the power of closing the sound-pipe; this we shall  see is accomplished by the synergic action of the muscles which make tense  and approximate the vocal cords. Although the elastic recoil of the lungs  and the structure of the expanded thorax is the main force employed in  normal breathing and to some extent in vocalisation (for it keeps up a  constant steady pressure), the mind, by exercising control over the  continuance of elevation of the ribs and contraction of the abdominal  muscles, regulates the force of the expiratory blast of air so as to employ  the bellows most efficiently in vocalisation. Not only does the contraction  of the abdominal muscles permit of control over the expulsion of the air,  but by fixing the cartilages of the lowest six ribs it prevents the  diaphragm drawing them upwards and _inwards_ (_vide_ fig. 2). The greatest  expansion is just above the waistband (_vide_ fig. 3). We are not conscious  of the contraction of the diaphragm; we are conscious of the position of  the walls of the chest and abdomen; the messages the mind receives relating  to the amount of air in the bellows at our disposal come from sensations  derived from the structures forming the wall of the chest and abdomen, viz.  the position of the ribs, their degree of elevation and forward protrusion  combined with the feeling that the ribs are falling back into the position  of rest; besides there is the feeling that the abdominal muscles can  contract no more--a feeling which should never be allowed to arise before  we become conscious of the necessity of replenishing the supply of air.  This should be effected by quickly drawing in air through the nostrils  without apparent effort and to as full extent as opportunity offers between  the phrases. By intelligence and perseverance the guiding sense which  informs the singer of the amount of air at his disposal, and when and how  it should be replenished and voluntarily used, is of fundamental importance  to good vocalisation. Collar-bone breathing is deprecated by some  authorities, but I see no reason why the apices of the lungs should not be  expanded, and seeing the frequency with which tubercle occurs in this  region, it might by improving the circulation and nutrition be even  beneficial. The proper mode of breathing comes almost natural to some  individuals; to others it requires patient cultivation under a teacher who  understands the art of singing and the importance of the correct methods of  breathing.    The more powerfully the abdominal muscles contract the laxer must become  the diaphragm muscle; and by the law of the reciprocal innervation of  antagonistic muscles it is probable that with the augmented innervation  currents to the expiratory centre of the medulla there is a corresponding  inhibition of the innervation currents to the inspiratory centre (_vide_  fig. 18, page 101). These centres in the medulla preside over the centres  in the spinal cord which are in direct relation to the inspiratory and  expiratory muscles. It is, however, probable that there is a direct  relation between the brain and the spinal nerve centres which control the  costal and abdominal muscles independently of the respiratory centres of  the medulla oblongata (_vide_ fig. 18). The best method of breathing is  that which is most natural; there should not be a protruded abdomen on the  one hand, nor an unduly inflated chest on the other hand; the maximum  expansion should involve the lower part of the chest and the uppermost part  of the abdomen on a level of an inch or more below the tip of the  breastbone; the expansion of the ribs should be maintained as long as  possible. In short phrases the movement may be limited to an ascent of the  diaphragm, over which we have not the same control as we have of the  elevation of the ribs; but it is better to reserve the costal air, over  which we have more voluntary control, for maintaining a continuous pressure  and for varying the pressure.          II. THE REED      I will now pass on to the consideration of the voice-box, or larynx,  containing the reed portion of the vocal instrument.    [Illustration: FIG. 4 From Behnke's \"Mechanism of the Human Voice\"]    [Description: FIG. 4.--The cartilages of the larynx or voice-box. A large  portion of the shield cartilage on the right side has been cut away, in  order to show the two pyramid cartilages; these are seen jointed by their  bases with the ring cartilage; anteriorly are seen the two vocal processes  which give attachment to the two vocal cords (white ligaments), which  extend across the voice-box to be inserted in front in the angle of the  shield cartilage. Groups of muscles pull upon these cartilages in such a  manner as to increase, or diminish, the chink between the vocal cord in  ordinary inspiration and expiration; in phonation a group of muscles  approximate the cords, while another muscle makes them tense.]    _The Larynx_.--The larynx is situated at the top of the sound-pipe (trachea  or windpipe), and consists of a framework of cartilages articulated or  jointed with one another so as to permit of movement (_vide_ fig. 4). The  cartilages are called by names which indicate their form and shape: (1)  shield or thyroid, (2) the ring or cricoid, and (3) a pair of pyramidal or  arytenoid cartilages. Besides these there is the epiglottis, which from its  situation above the glottis acts more or less as a lid. The shield  cartilage is attached by ligaments and muscles to the bone (hyoid) in the  root of the tongue, a pair of muscles also connect this cartilage with the  sternum or breastbone. The ring cartilage is attached to the windpipe by  its lower border; by its upper border in front it is connected with the  inner surface of the shield cartilage by a ligament; it is also jointed on  either side with the shield cartilage. The posterior part of the ring  cartilage is much wider than the anterior portion, and seated upon its  upper and posterior rim and articulated with it by separate joints are the  two pyramidal cartilages (_vide_ fig. 4). The two vocal cords as shown in  the diagram are attached to the shield cartilage in front, their  attachments being close together; posteriorly they are attached to the  pyramidal cartilages. It is necessary, however, to describe a little more  fully these attachments. Extending forwards from the base of the pyramids  are processes termed the \"vocal processes,\" and these processes give  attachment to the elastic fibres of which the vocal cords mainly consist.  There are certain groups of muscles which by their attachment to the  cartilages of the larynx and their action on the joints are able to  separate the vocal cords or approximate them; these are termed respectively  abductor and adductor muscles (figs. 5 and 6). In normal respiration the  posterior ring-pyramidal muscles contract synergically with the muscles of  inspiration and by separating the vocal cords open wide the glottis,  whereby there is a free entrance of air to the windpipe; during expiration  this muscle ceases to contract and the aperture of the glottis becomes  narrower (_vide_ fig. 10). But when the pressure is required to be raised  in the air passages, as in the simple reflex act of coughing or in  vocalisation, the glottis must be closed by approximation of the vocal  cords, and this is effected by a group of muscles termed the adductors,  which pull on the pyramid cartilages in such a way that the vocal processes  are drawn towards one another in the manner shown in fig. 7. Besides the  abductor and adductor groups of muscles, there is a muscle which acts in  conjunction with the adductor group, and by its attachments to the shield  cartilage above and the ring cartilage below makes tense the vocal cords  (_vide_ fig. 5); it is of interest to note that this muscle has a separate  nerve supply to that of the abductor and adductor muscles.
