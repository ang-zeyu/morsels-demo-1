Neither Mahomet's father  nor mother are known to us in any detail; they are merely the passive  instruments of Mahomet's prophetic mission. His real parents are his  grandfather and his uncle Abu Talib; but more than these, the desert  that nurtured him, physically and mentally, that bounded his horizon  throughout his life and impressed its mighty mysteries upon his  unconscious childhood and his eager, imaginative youth.          CHAPTER II      CHILDHOOD    \"Paradise lies at the feet of mothers.\"--MAHOMET.    No more beautiful and tender legends cluster round Mahomet than those  which grace his life in the desert under the loving care of his  foster-mother Hailima. She was a woman of the tribe of Beni Sa'ad, who  for generations had roamed the desert, tent-dwellers, who visited cities  but rarely, and kept about them the remoteness and freedom of their  adventurous life beneath the sun and stars.    About the time of Mahomet's birth a famine fell upon the Beni Sa'ad,  which left nothing of all their stores, and the women of the tribe  journeyed,[28] weary and stricken with hunger, into the city of Mecca  that they might obtain foster-children whose parents would give them  money and blessings if they could but get their little ones taken away  from that unhealthy place. Among these was Hailima, who, according to  tradition, has left behind her the narrative of that dreadful journey  across the desert with her husband and her child, and with only an ass  and a she-camel for transport. Famine oppressed them sorely, together  with the heat of desert suns, until there was no sustenance for any  living creature; then, faint and travel-weary, they reached the city and  began their quest.    Mahomet was offered to every woman of the tribe, but they rejected him  as he had no father, and there was little hope of much payment from the  mothers of these children. Those of rich parents were eagerly spoken  for, but no one would care for the little fatherless child. And it  happened that Hailima also was unsuccessful in her search, and was like  to have returned to her people disconsolate, but when she saw  Mahomet she bethought herself and said to her husband:    \"By the God of my fathers, I will not go back to my companions without  foster-child. I will take this orphan.\"    And her husband replied: \"It cannot harm thee to do this, and if thou  takest him it may be that through him God will bless us.\"    So Hailima took him, and she relates how good fortune attended her from  that day. Her camels gave abundant milk during the homeward journey, and  in the unfruitful land of the Beni Sa'ad her cattle were always fattest  and yielded most milk, until her neighbours besought her to allow them  to pasture their cattle with hers. But, adds the chronicler naively, in  spite of this their cattle returned to them thin and yielding little,  while Hailima's waxed fat and fruitful. These legends are the translation  into poetic fact of the peace and love surrounding Mahomet during the five  years he spent with Hailima; for in all primitive communities every  experience must pass through transmutation into the definite and tangible  and be given a local habitation and a name.    When Mahomet was two years old and the time had come to restore him to  his mother, Hailima took him back to Mecca; but his mother gave him to  her again because he had thriven so well under desert skies, and she  feared the stifling air of Mecca for her only son. So Hailima returned  with him and brought him up as one of her children until he was five,  when the first signs of his nervous, highly-strung nature showed  themselves in a kind of epileptic fit. The Arabians, unskilled as they  were in any medical science, attributed manifestations of this kind to  evil spirits, and it is not surprising that we find Hailima bringing him  back to his grandfather in great alarm. So ended his fostering by the  desert and by Hailima.    Of these five years spent among the Beni Sa'ad chroniclers have spoken  in much detail, but their confused accounts are so interwoven with  legend that it is impossible to re-create events, and we can only obtain  a general idea of his life as a tiny child among the children of the  tribe, sharing their fortunes, playing and quarrelling with them, and at  moments, when the spirit seemed to advance beyond its dwelling-place,  gazing wide-eyed upon the limitless desert under the blaze of sun or  below the velvet dark, with swift, half-conscious questionings uttering  the universal why and how [31] of childhood. Legend regards even this  early time as one of preparation for his mission, and there are stories  of the coming of two men clothed in white and shining garments, who  ripped open his body, took out his heart, and having purged it of all  unrighteousness, returned it, symbolically cleansing him of sin that he  might forward the work of God. It was an imaginative rightness that  decreed that Mahomet's most impressionable years should be spent in the  great desert, whose twin influences of fierceness and fatalism he felt  throughout his life, and which finally became the key-notes of his  worship of Allah.    Hailima, convinced that her foster-son was possessed by evil spirits,  resolved to return him to Abd al Muttalib, but as she journeyed through  Upper Mecca, the child wandered away and was lost for a time. Hailima  hurried, much agitated, to his grandfather, who immediately sent his  sons to search, and after a short time they returned with the boy,  unharmed and unfrightened by his adventure. The legend--it is quite a  late accretion--is interesting, as showing an acquaintance with, and a  parallelism to, the story of the losing of Jesus among the Passover  crowds, and the search for Him by His kindred. Mahomet was at last  lodged with his mother, who indignantly explained to Hailima the real  meaning of his malady, and spoke of his future glory as manifested to  her by the light that enfolded her before his birth. Not long after,  Amina decided to visit her [32] husband's tomb at Medina, and thither  Mahomet accompanied her, travelling through the rocky, desolate valleys  and hills that separate the two, with just his mother and a slave girl.      Mahomet was too young to remember much about the journey to Medina,  except that it was hot and that he was often tired, and since his father  was but a name to him, the visit to his tomb faded altogether from his  mind. But on the homeward journey a calamity overtook him which he  remembered all his life. Amina, weakened by journeying and much  sorrow, and perhaps feeling her desire for life forsake her after the  fulfillment of her pilgrimage, sickened and died at Abwa, and Mahomet  and the slave girl continued their mournful way alone.    Amina is drawn by tradition in very vague outline, and Mahomet's memory  of her as given in the Kuran does not throw so much light upon the woman  herself as upon her child's devotion and affectionate memory of the  mother he lost almost before he knew her. His grief for her was very  real; she remained continually in his thoughts, and in after years  he paid tribute at her tomb to her tenderness and love for him.    \"This is the grave of my mother ... the Lord hath permitted me to visit  it.... I called my mother to remembrance, and the tender memory of her  overcame me and I wept.\"    The sensitive, over-nervous child, left thus solitary, away from all his  kindred, must have brought back with him to Mecca confused but vivid  impressions of the long journey and of the catastrophe which lay at the  end of it. The uncertainty of his future, and the joys of gaining at  last a foster-father in Abd al Muttalib, finds reflection in the Kuran  in one little burst of praise to God: \"Did He not find thee an orphan,  and furnish thee with a refuge?\"    Life for two years as the foster-child of Abd al Muttalib, the venerable,  much honoured chief of the house of Hashim, passed very pleasantly for  Mahomet. He was the darling of his grandfather's last years of life; for,  perhaps having pity on his defencelessness, perhaps divining with that  prescience which often marks old age, something of the revelation this  child was to be to his countrymen, he protected him from the harshness of  his uncles. A rug used to be placed in the shadow of the Kaaba, and there  the aged ruler rested during the heat of the day, and his sons sat around  him at respectful distance, listening to his words. But the child  Mahomet, who loved his grandfather, ran fearlessly up, and would have  seated himself by Abd al Muttalib's side. Then the sons sought to  punish him for his lack of reverence, but their father prevented them:    \"Leave the child in peace. By the God of my fathers, I swear he will one  day be a mighty prophet.\"    So Mahomet remained in close attendance upon the old man, until he died  in the eighth year after the Year of the Elephant, and there was mourning  for him in the houses of his sons.    When Abd al Muttalib knew his end was near he sent for his daughters, and  bade them make lamentation over him. We possess traditional accounts of  these funeral songs; they are representative of the wild rhetorical  eloquence of the poetry of the day. They lose immensely in translation,  and even in reading with the eye instead of hearing, for they were never  meant to find immortality in the written words, but in the speech of men.    \"When in the night season a voice of loud lament proclaimed the sorrowful  tidings I wept, so that the tears ran down my face like pearls.

It was not a loud noise, but rather like that which a boat  makes jostling against another at sea, only there was something deeper  and more hollow about it. We boys looked at each other, for we knew what  was under the church, and that the sound could only come from the Mohune  Vault. No one at Moonfleet had ever seen the inside of that vault; but  Ratsey was told by his father, who was clerk before him, that it underlay  half the chancel, and that there were more than a score of Mohunes lying  there. It had not been opened for over forty years, since Gerald Mohune,  who burst a blood-vessel drinking at Weymouth races, was buried there;  but there was a tale that one Sunday afternoon, many years back, there  had come from the vault so horrible and unearthly a cry, that parson and  people got up and fled from the church, and would not worship there for  weeks afterwards.    We thought of these stories, and huddled up closer to the brazier, being  frightened at the noise, and uncertain whether we should not turn tail  and run from the church. For it was certain that something was moving in  the Mohune vault, to which there was no entrance except by a ringed stone  in the chancel floor, that had not been lifted for forty years.    However, we thought better of it, and did not budge, though I could see  when standing up and looking over the tops of the seats that others  beside ourselves were ill at ease; for Granny Tucker gave such starts  when she heard the sounds, that twice her spectacles fell off her nose  into her lap, and Master Ratsey seemed to be trying to mask the one noise  by making another himself, whether by shuffling with his feet or by  thumping down his prayer-book. But the thing that most surprised me was  that even Elzevir Block, who cared, men said, for neither God nor Devil,  looked unquiet, and gave a quick glance at Ratsey every time the sound  came. So we sat till Mr. Glennie was well on with the sermon. His  discourse interested me though I was only a boy, for he likened life to  the letter 'Y', saying that 'in each man's life must come a point where  two roads part like the arms of a \"Y\", and that everyone must choose for  himself whether he will follow the broad and sloping path on the left or  the steep and narrow path on the right. For,' said he, 'if you will look  in your books, you will see that the letter \"Y\" is not like the Mohunes',  with both arms equal, but has the arm on the left broader and more  sloping than the arm on the right; hence ancient philosophers hold that  this arm on the left represents the easy downward road to destruction,  and the arm on the right the narrow upward path of life.' When we heard  that we all fell to searching our prayer-books for a capital 'Y'; and  Granny Tucker, who knew not A from B, made much ado in fumbling with her  book, for she would have people think that she could read. Then just at  that moment came a noise from below louder than those before, hollow and  grating like the cry of an old man in pain. With that up jumps Granny  Tucker, calling out loud in church to Mr. Glennie--    'O Master, however can'ee bide there preaching when the Moons be rising  from their graves?' and out from the church.    That was too much for the others, and all fled, Mrs. Vining crying,  'Lordsakes, we shall all be throttled like Cracky Jones.'    So in a minute there were none left in the church, save and except Mr.  Glennie, with me, Ratsey, and Elzevir Block. I did not run: first, not  wishing to show myself coward before the men; second, because I thought  if Blackbeard came he would fall on the men rather than on a boy; and  third, that if it came to blows, Block was strong enough to give account  even of a Mohune. Mr. Glennie went on with his sermon, making as though  he neither heard any noise nor saw the people leave the church; and when  he had finished, Elzevir walked out, but I stopped to see what the  minister would say to Ratsey about the noise in the vault. The sexton  helped Mr. Glennie off with his gown, and then seeing me standing by and  listening, said--    'The Lord has sent evil angels among us; 'tis a terrible thing, Master  Glennie, to hear the dead men moving under our feet.'    'Tut, tut,' answered the minister, 'it is only their own fears that make  such noises terrible to the vulgar. As for Blackbeard, I am not here to  say whether guilty spirits sometimes cannot rest and are seen wandering  by men; but for these noises, they are certainly Nature's work as is the  noise of waves upon the beach. The floods have filled the vault with  water, and so the coffins getting afloat, move in some eddies that we  know not of, and jostle one another. Then being hollow, they give forth  those sounds you hear, and these are your evil angels. 'Tis very true the  dead do move beneath our feet, but 'tis because they cannot help  themselves, being carried hither and thither by the water. Fie, Ratsey  man, you should know better than to fright a boy with silly talk of  spirits when the truth is bad enough.'    The parson's words had the ring of truth in them to me, and I never  doubted that he was right. So this mystery was explained, and yet it was  a dreadful thing, and made me shiver, to think of the Mohunes all adrift  in their coffins, and jostling one another in the dark. I pictured them  to myself, the many generations, old men and children, man and maid, all  bones now, each afloat in his little box of rotting wood; and Blackbeard  himself in a great coffin bigger than all the rest, coming crashing into  the weaker ones, as a ship in a heavy sea comes crashing down sometimes  in the trough, on a small boat that is trying to board her. And then  there was the outer darkness of the vault itself to think of, and the  close air, and the black putrid water nearly up to the roof on which such  sorry ships were sailing.    Ratsey looked a little crestfallen at what Mr. Glennie said, but put a  good face on it, and answered--    'Well, master, I am but a plain man, and know nothing about floods and  these eddies and hidden workings of Nature of which you speak; but,  saving your presence, I hold it a fond thing to make light of such  warnings as are given us. 'Tis always said, \"When the Moons move, then  Moonfleet mourns\"; and I have heard my father tell that the last time  they stirred was in Queen Anne's second year, when the great storm blew  men's homes about their heads. And as for frighting children, 'tis well  that heady boys should learn to stand in awe, and not pry into what does  not concern them--or they may come to harm.' He added the last words with  what I felt sure was a nod of warning to myself, though I did not then  understand what he meant. So he walked off in a huff with Elzevir, who  was waiting for him outside, and I went with Mr. Glennie and carried his  gown for him back to his lodging in the village.    Mr. Glennie was always very friendly, making much of me, and talking to  me as though I were his equal; which was due, I think, to there being no  one of his own knowledge in the neighbourhood, and so he had as lief talk  to an ignorant boy as to an ignorant man. After we had passed the  churchyard turnstile and were crossing the sludgy meadows, I asked him  again what he knew of Blackbeard and his lost treasure.    'My son,' he answered, 'all that I have been able to gather is, that this  Colonel John Mohune (foolishly called Blackbeard) was the first to impair  the family fortunes by his excesses, and even let the almshouses fall to  ruin, and turned the poor away. Unless report strangely belies him, he  was an evil man, and besides numberless lesser crimes, had on his hands  the blood of a faithful servant, whom he made away with because chance  had brought to the man's ears some guilty secret of the master. Then, at  the end of his life, being filled with fear and remorse (as must always  happen with evil livers at the last), he sent for Rector Kindersley of  Dorchester to confess him, though a Protestant, and wished to make amends  by leaving that treasure so ill-gotten from King Charles (which was all  that he had to leave) for the repair and support of the almshouses. He  made a last will, which I have seen, to this effect, but without  describing the treasure further than to call it a diamond, nor saying  where it was to be found. Doubtless he meant to get it himself, sell it,  and afterwards apply the profit to his good purpose, but before he could  do so death called him suddenly to his account. So men say that he cannot  rest in his grave, not having made even so tardy a reparation, and never  will rest unless the treasure is found and spent upon the poor.'    I thought much over what Mr. Glennie had said and fell to wondering where  Blackbeard could have hid his diamond, and whether I might not find it  some day and make myself a rich man. Now, as I considered that noise we  had heard under the church, and Parson Glennie's explanation of it, I was  more and more perplexed; for the noise had, as I have said, something  deep and hollow-booming in it, and how was that to be made by decayed  coffins. I had more than once seen Ratsey, in digging a grave, turn up  pieces of coffins, and sometimes a tarnished name-plate would show that  they had not been so very long underground, and yet the wood was quite  decayed and rotten. And granting that such were in the earth, and so  might more easily perish, yet when the top was taken off old Guy's brick  grave to put his widow beside him, Master Ratsey gave me a peep in, and  old Guy's coffin had cracks and warps in it, and looked as if a sound  blow would send it to pieces. Yet here were the Mohune coffins that had  been put away for generations, and must be rotten as tinder, tapping  against each other with a sound like a drum, as if they were still sound  and air-tight. Still, Mr. Glennie must be right;"]]]
