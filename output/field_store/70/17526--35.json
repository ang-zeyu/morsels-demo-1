[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#3)"],[1,"dge, name unknown, he thanks him for being \"a good  watchman to admonish that the hours of the night pass on, for so I  call my life as yet obscure and unserviceable to mankind, and that the  day with me is at hand, wherein Christ commands all to labour.\" Milton  has no misgivings. He knows that what he is doing with himself is the  best he can do. His aim is far above bread-winning, and therefore his  probation must be long. He destines for himself no indolent tarrying  in the garden of Armida. His is a \"mind made and set wholly on the  accomplishment of greatest things.\" He knows that the looker-on will  hardly accept his apology for \"being late,\" that it is in order to  being \"more fit.\" Yet it is the only apology he can offer. And he is  dissatisfied with his own progress. \"I am something suspicious of  myself, and do take notice of a certain belatedness in me.\"    Of this frame of mind the record is the second sonnet, lines which are  an inseparable part of Milton's biography--        How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,          Stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!          My hasting days fly on with full career,      But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.      Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth          That I to manhood am arrived so near,          And inward ripeness doth much less appear,      That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.      Yet, be it less or more, or soon or slow,          It shall be still in strictest measure even          To that same lot, however mean or high,      Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven.          All is, if I have grace to use it so,          As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.    With aspirations thus vast, though unformed, with \"amplitude of mind  to greatest deeds,\" Milton retired to his father's house in the  country. Five more years of self-education, added to the seven years  of academical residence, were not too much for the meditation of  projects such as Milton was already conceiving. Years many more than  twelve, filled with great events and distracting interests, were to  pass over before the body and shape of _Paradise Lost_ was given to  these imaginings.    The country retirement in which the elder Milton had fixed himself was  the little village of Horton, situated in that southernmost angle of  the county of Buckingham, which insinuates itself between Berks and  Middlesex. Though London was only about seventeen miles distant, it  was the London of Charles I., with its population of some 300,000  only; before coaches and macadamised roads; while the Colne, which  flows through the village, was still a river, and not the kennel of a  paper-mill. There was no lack of water and woods meadow and pasture,  closes and open field, with the regal towers of Windsor--\"bosom'd high  in tufted trees,\" to crown the landscape. Unbroken leisure, solitude,  tranquillity of mind, surrounded by the thickets and woods, which  Pliny thought indispensable to poetical meditation (Epist.9.10), no  poet's career was ever commenced under more favourable auspices. The  youth of Milton stands in strong contrast with the misery, turmoil,  chance medley, struggle with poverty, or abandonment to dissipation,  which blighted the early years of so many of our men of letters.    Milton's life is a drama in three acts. The first discovers him in  the calm and peaceful retirement of Horton, of which _L'Allegro_, _Il  Penseroso_, and _Lycidas_ are the expression. In the second act he  is breathing the foul and heated atmosphere of party passion and  religious hate, generating the lurid fires which glare in the  battailous canticles of his prose pamphlets. The three great poems,  _Paradise Lost_, _Paradise Regained_, and _Samson Agonistes_, are the  utterance of his final period of solitary and Promethean grandeur,  when, blind, destitute, friendless, he testified of righteousness,  temperance, and judgment to come, alone before a fallen world.    In this delicious retirement of Horton, in alternate communing with  nature and with books, for five years of persevering study he laid in  a stock, not of learning, but of what is far above learning, of wide  and accurate knowledge. Of the man whose profession is learning, it  is characteristic that knowledge is its own end, and research its own  reward. To Milton all knowledge, all life, virtue itself, was already  only a means to a further end. He will know only \"that which is of use  to know,\" and by useful, he meant that which conduced to form him for  his vocation of poet.    From a very early period Milton had taken poetry to be his vocation,  in the most solemn and earnest mood. The idea of this devotion was the  shaping idea of his life. It was, indeed, a bent of nature, with roots  drawing from deeper strata of character than any act of reasoned will,  which kept him out of the professions, and now fixed him, a seeming  idler, but really hard at work, in his father's house at Horton. The  intimation which he had given of his purpose in the sonnet above  quoted had become, in 1641, \"an inward prompting which grows daily  upon me, that by labour and intent study, which I take to be my  portion in this life, joined with the strong propensity of nature,  I might perhaps leave something so written to after times, as they  should not willingly let it die.\"    What the ultimate form of his poetic utterance shall be, he is in no  hurry to decide. He will be \"long choosing,\" and quite content to be  \"beginning late.\" All his care at present is to qualify himself  for the lofty function to which he aspires. No lawyer, physician,  statesman, ever laboured to fit himself for his profession harder  than Milton strove to qualify himself for his vocation of poet.  Verse-making is, to the wits, a game of ingenuity; to Milton, it is  a prophetic office, towards which the will of heaven leads him. The  creation he contemplates will not flow from him as the stanzas of the  _Gerusalemme_ did from Tasso at twenty-one. Before he can make a poem,  Milton will make himself. \"I was confirmed in this opinion, that he  who would not be frustrated of his hope to write well hereafter in  laudable things ought himself to be a true poem.... not presuming to  sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities, unless he have  in himself the experience and practise of all that which is  praiseworthy.\"    Of the spontaneity, the abandon, which are supposed to be  characteristic of the poetical nature, there is nothing here; all  is moral purpose, precision, self-dedication. So he acquires ail  knowledge, not for knowledge' sake, from the instinct of learning, the  necessity for completeness, but because he is to be a poet. Nor will  he only have knowledge, he will have wisdom; moral development shall  go hand in hand with intellectual. A poet's soul should \"contain of  good, wise, just, the perfect shape.\" He will cherish continually a  pure mind in a pure body. \"I argued to myself that, if unchastity in  a woman, whom St. Paul terms the glory of man, be such a scandal and  dishonour, then certainly in a man, who is both the image and glory of  God, it must, though commonly not so thought, be much more deflouring  and dishonourable.\" There is yet a third constituent of the poetical  nature; to knowledge and to virtue must be added religion. For it is  from God that the poet's thoughts come. \"This is not to be obtained  but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit that can enrich with all  utterance and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim with the hallowed  fire of his altar, to touch and purify the life of whom he pleases. To  this must be added industrious and select reading, steady observation,  and insight into all seemly and generous acts and affairs; till which  in some measure be compast, I refuse not to sustain this expectation.\"  Before the piety of this vow, Dr. Johnson's morosity yields for a  moment, and he is forced to exclaim, \"From a promise like this, at  once fervid, pious, and rational, might be expected the _Paradise  Lost_.\"    Of these years of self-cultivation, of conscious moral architecture,  such as Plato enacted for his ideal State, but none but Milton ever  had the courage to practise, the biographer would gladly give a minute  account. But the means of doing so are wanting. The poet kept no diary  of his reading, such as some great students, e.g. Isaac Casaubon, have  left. Nor could such a record, had it been attempted, have shown us  the secret process by which the scholar's dead learning was transmuted  in Milton's mind into living imagery. \"Many studious and contemplative  years, altogether spent in the search of religious and civil  knowledge\" is his own description of the period. \"You make many  inquiries as to what I am about;\" he writes to Diodati--\"what am I  thinking of? Why, with God's help, of immortality! Forgive the word, I  only whisper it in your ear! Yes, I am pluming my wings for a flight.\"  This was in 1637, at the end of five years of the Horton probation.  The poems, which, rightly read, are strewn with autobiographical  hints, are not silent as to the intention of this period. In _Paradise  Regained_ (i. 196), Milton reveals himself. And in _Comus_, written  at Horton, the lines 375 and following are charged with the same  sentiment,--                            And wisdom's self      Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,      Where, with her best nurse, contemplations      She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,      That in the various bustle of resort      Were all-to ruffled and sometimes impair'd.    That at Horton Milton \"read all the Greek and Latin writers\" is one of  Johnson's careless versions of Milton's own words, \"enjoyed a complete  holiday in turning over Latin and Greek authors.\" Milton read, not as  a professional philologian, but as a poet and scholar, and always in  the light of his secret purpose. It was not in his way to sit down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#3)"],[1,"you not know that all this while Jurgen does his own sewing, and  is once more making eyes at Countess Dorothy?\"    Dame Lisa shuddered; but she only said, \"Follow me!\"    And the notary's wife followed her to Amneran Heath, and across the  heath, to where a cave was. This was a place of abominable repute. A  lean hound came to meet them there in the twilight, lolling his  tongue: but the notary's wife struck thrice with her wand, and the  silent beast left them. And Dame Lisa passed silently into the cave,  and her sister turned and went home to her children, weeping.    So the next evening Jurgen himself came to Morven, because all his  wife's family assured him this was the manly thing to do. Jurgen  left the shop in charge of Urien Villemarche, who was a highly  efficient clerk. Jurgen followed his wife across Amneran Heath until  they reached the cave. Jurgen would willingly have been elsewhere.    For the hound squatted upon his haunches, and seemed to grin at  Jurgen; and there were other creatures abroad, that flew low in the  twilight, keeping close to the ground like owls; but they were  larger than owls and were more discomforting. And, moreover, all  this was just after sunset upon Walburga's Eve, when almost anything  is rather more than likely to happen.    So Jurgen said, a little peevishly: \"Lisa, my dear, if you go into  the cave I will have to follow you, because it is the manly thing to  do. And you know how easily I take cold.\"    The voice of Dame Lisa, now, was thin and wailing, a curiously  changed voice. \"There is a cross about your neck. You must throw  that away.\"    Jurgen was wearing such a cross, through motives of sentiment,  because it had once belonged to his dead mother. But now, to  pleasure his wife, he removed the trinket, and hung it on a barberry  bush; and with the reflection that this was likely to prove a  deplorable business, he followed Dame Lisa into the cave.          2.    Assumption of a Noted Garment      The tale tells that all was dark there, and Jurgen could see no one.  But the cave stretched straight forward, and downward, and at the  far end was a glow of light. Jurgen went on and on, and so came  presently to a centaur: and this surprised him not a little, because  Jurgen knew that centaurs were imaginary creatures.    Certainly they were curious to look at: for here was the body of a  fine bay horse, and rising from its shoulders, the sun-burnt body of  a young fellow who regarded Jurgen with grave and not unfriendly  eyes. The Centaur was lying beside a fire of cedar and juniper wood:  near him was a platter containing a liquid with which he was  anointing his hoofs. This stuff, as the Centaur rubbed it in with  his fingers, turned the appearance of his hoofs to gold.    \"Hail, friend,\" says Jurgen, \"if you be the work of God.\"    \"Your protasis is not good Greek,\" observed the Centaur, \"because in  Hellas we did not make such reservations. Besides, it is not so much  my origin as my destination which concerns you.\"    \"Well, friend, and whither are you going?\"    \"To the garden between dawn and sunrise, Jurgen.\"    \"Surely, now, but that is a fine name for a garden! and it is a  place I would take joy to be seeing.\"    \"Up upon my back, Jurgen, and I will take you thither,\" says the  Centaur, and heaved to his feet. Then said the Centaur, when the  pawnbroker hesitated: \"Because, as you must understand, there is no  other way. For this garden does not exist, and never did exist, in  what men humorously called real life; so that of course only  imaginary creatures such as I can enter it.\"    \"That sounds very reasonable,\" Jurgen estimated: \"but as it happens,  I am looking for my wife, whom I suspect to have been carried off by  a devil, poor fellow!\"    And Jurgen began to explain to the Centaur what had befallen.    The Centaur laughed. \"It may be for that reason I am here. There is,  in any event, only one remedy in this matter. Above all devils--and  above all gods, they tell me, but certainly above all centaurs--is  the power of Koshchei the Deathless, who made things as they are.\"    \"It is not always wholesome,\" Jurgen submitted, \"to speak of  Koshchei. It seems especially undesirable in a dark place like  this.\"    \"None the less, I suspect it is to him you must go for justice.\"    \"I would prefer not doing that,\" said Jurgen, with unaffected  candor.    \"You have my sympathy: but there is no question of preference where  Koshchei is concerned. Do you think, for example, that I am frowzing  in this underground place by my own choice? and knew your name by  accident?\"    Jurgen was frightened, a little. \"Well, well! but it is usually the  deuce and all, this doing of the manly thing. How, then, can I come  to Koshchei?\"    \"Roundabout,\" says the Centaur. \"There is never any other way.\"    \"And is the road to this garden roundabout?\"    \"Oh, very much so, inasmuch as it circumvents both destiny and  common-sense.\"    \"Needs must, then,\" says Jurgen: \"at all events, I am willing to  taste any drink once.\"    \"You will be chilled, though, traveling as you are. For you and I  are going a queer way, in search of justice, over the grave of a  dream and through the malice of time. So you had best put on this  shirt above your other clothing.\"    \"Indeed it is a fine snug shining garment, with curious figures on  it. I accept such raiment gladly. And whom shall I be thanking for  his kindness, now?\"    \"My name,\" said the Centaur, \"is Nessus.\"    \"Well, then, friend Nessus, I am at your service.\"    And in a trice Jurgen was on the Centaur's back, and the two of them  had somehow come out of the cave, and were crossing Amneran Heath.  So they passed into a wooded place, where the light of sunset yet  lingered, rather unaccountably. Now the Centaur went westward. And  now about the pawnbroker's shoulders and upon his breast and over  his lean arms glittered like a rainbow the many-colored shirt of  Nessus.    For a while they went through the woods, which were composed of big  trees standing a goodish distance from one another, with the  Centaur's gilded hoofs rustling and sinking in a thick carpet of  dead leaves, all gray and brown, in level stretches that were  unbroken by any undergrowth. And then they came to a white roadway  that extended due west, and so were done with the woods. Now  happened an incredible thing in which Jurgen would never have  believed had he not seen it with his own eyes: for now the Centaur  went so fast that he gained a little by a little upon the sun, thus  causing it to rise in the west a little by a little; and these two  sped westward in the glory of a departed sunset. The sun fell full  in Jurgen's face as he rode straight toward the west, so that he  blinked and closed his eyes, and looked first toward this side, then  the other. Thus it was that the country about him, and the persons  they were passing, were seen by him in quick bright flashes, like  pictures suddenly transmuted into other pictures; and all his  memories of this shining highway were, in consequence, always  confused and incoherent.    He wondered that there seemed to be so many young women along the  road to the garden. Here was a slim girl in white teasing a great  brown and yellow dog that leaped about her clumsily; here a girl sat  in the branches of a twisted and gnarled tree, and back of her was a  broad muddied river, copper-colored in the sun; and here shone the  fair head of a tall girl on horseback, who seemed to wait for  someone: in fine, the girls along the way were numberless, and  Jurgen thought he recollected one or two of them.    But the Centaur went so swiftly that Jurgen could not be sure.          3.    The Garden between Dawn and Sunrise      Thus it was that Jurgen and the Centaur came to the garden between  dawn and sunrise, entering this place in a fashion which it is not  convenient to record. But as they passed over the bridge three fled  before them, screaming. And when the life had been trampled out of  the small furry bodies which these three had misused, there was none  to oppose the Centaur's entry into the garden between dawn and  sunrise.    This was a wonderful garden: yet nothing therein was strange.  Instead, it seemed that everything hereabouts was heart-breakingly  familiar and very dear to Jurgen. For he had come to a broad lawn  which slanted northward to a well-remembered brook: and  multitudinous maples and locust-trees stood here and there,  irregularly, and were being played with very lazily by an irresolute  west wind, so that foliage seemed to toss and ripple everywhere like  green spray: but autumn was at hand, for the locust-trees were  dropping a Danae's shower of small round yellow leaves. Around the  garden was an unforgotten circle of blue hills. And this was a place  of lucent twilight, unlit by either sun or stars, and with no  shadows anywhere in the diffused faint radiancy that revealed this  garden, which is not visible to any man except in the brief interval  between dawn and sunrise.    \"Why, but it is Count Emmerick's garden at Storisende,\" says Jurgen,  \"where I used to be having such fine times when I was a lad.\"    \"I will wager,\" said Nessus, \"that you did not use to walk alone in  this garden.\"    \"Well, no; there was a girl.\"    \"Just so,\" assented Nessus. \"It is a local by-law: and here are  those who comply with it.\"    For now had come toward them, walking together in the dawn, a  handsome boy and girl. And the girl was incredibly beautiful,  because everybody in the garden saw her with the vision of the boy  who was with her. \"I am Rudolph,\" said this boy, \"and she is Anne.\"    \"And are you happy here?\" asked Jurgen.    \"Oh, yes, sir, we are tolerably happy: but Anne's father is very  rich, and my mother is poor, so that we cannot be quite happy until  I have gone into foreign lands and come back with a great many lakhs  of rupees and pieces of eight.\"    \"And what will you do"]]]
