We have remitted to the knights of the Temple the money we had resolved  to send you.  We have, besides, reimbursed the Count of Vermandois the  three thousand livres he had lent us for your service.  Your land and  your people are in the enjoyment, for the present, of a happy peace.  You  will find your houses and your palaces in good condition through the care  we have taken to have them repaired.  Behold me now in the decline of  age: and I dare to say that the occupations in which I have engaged for  the love of God and through attachment to your person have added many to  my years.  In respect of the queen, your consort, I am of opinion that  you should conceal the displeasure she causes you, until, restored to  your dominions, you can calmly deliberate upon that and upon other  subjects.\"    On once more entering his kingdom, Louis, who, at a distance, had  sometimes lent a credulous ear to the complaints of the discontented or  to the calumnies of Suger's enemies, did him full justice and was the  first to give him the name of Father of the country.  The ill success of  the crusade and the remembrance of all that France had risked and lost  for nothing, made a deep impression upon the public; and they honored  Suger for his far-sightedness whilst they blamed St. Bernard for the  infatuation which he had fostered and for the disasters which had  followed it.  St. Bernard accepted their reproaches in a pious spirit:  \"If,\" said he, \"there must be murmuring against God or against me, I  prefer to see the murmurs of men falling upon me rather than upon the  Lord.  To me it is a blessed thing that God should deign to use me as a  buckler to shield Himself.  I shrink not from humiliation, provided that  His glory be unassailed.\"  But at the same time St. Bernard himself was  troubled, and he permitted himself to give expression to his troubled  feelings in a singularly free and bold strain of piety.  \"We be fallen  upon very grievous times,\" he wrote to Pope Eugenius III.; \"the Lord,  provoked by our sins, seemeth in some sort to have determined to judge  the world before the time, and to judge it, doubtless, according to His  equity, but not remembering His mercy.  Do not the heathen say, 'Where is  now their God?'  And who can wonder?  The children of the Church, those  who be called Christian, lie stretched upon the desert, smitten with the  sword or dead of famine.  Did we undertake the work rashly?  Did we  behave ourselves lightly?  How patiently God heareth the sacrilegious  voices and the blasphemies of these Egyptians!  Assuredly His judgments  be righteous; who doth not know it?  But in the present judgment there is  so profound a depth, that I hesitate not to call him blessed whosoever is  not surprised and offended by it.\"    The soul of man, no less than the shifting scene of the world, is often a  great subject of surprise.  King Louis, on his way back to France, had  staid some days at Rome; and there, in a conversation with the pope, he  had almost promised him a new crusade to repair the disasters of that  from which he had found it so difficult to get out.  Suger, when he  became acquainted with this project, opposed it as he had opposed the  former; but, at the same time, as he, in common with all his age,  considered the deliverance of the Holy Land to be the bounden duty of  Christians, he conceived the idea of dedicating the large fortune and  great influence he had acquired to the cause of a new crusade, to be  undertaken by himself and at his own expense, without compromising either  king or state.  He unfolded his views to a meeting of bishops assembled  at Chartres; and he went to Tours, and paid a visit to the tomb of St.  Martin to implore his protection.  Already more than ten thousand  pilgrims were in arms at his call, and already he had himself chosen a  warrior, of ability and renown, to command them, when he fell ill, and  died at the end of four months, in 1152, aged seventy, and \"thanking the  Almighty,\" says his biographer, \"for having taken him to Him, not  suddenly, but little by little, in order to bring him step by step to the  rest needful for the weary man.\"  It is said that, in his last days and  when St. Bernard was exhorting him not to think any more save only of the  heavenly Jerusalem, Suger still expressed to him his regret at dying  without having succored the city which was so dear to them both.    Almost at the very moment when Suger was dying, a French council,  assembled at Beaugency, was annulling on the ground of prohibited  consanguinity, and with the tacit consent of the two persons most  concerned, the marriage of Louis VII. and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  Some  months afterwards, at Whitsuntide in the same year, Henry Plantagenet,  Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, espoused Eleanor, thus adding to his  already great possessions Poitou and Aquitaine, and becoming, in France,  a vassal more powerful than the king his suzerain.  Twenty months later,  in 1154, at the death of King Stephen, Henry Plantagenet became King of  England; and thus there was a recurrence, in an aggravated form, of the  position which had been filled by William the Conqueror, and which was  the first cause of rivalry between France and England and of the  consequent struggles of considerably more than a century's duration.    Little more than a year after Suger, on the 20th of April, 1153,  St. Bernard died also.  The two great men, of whom one had excited and  the other opposed the second crusade, disappeared together from the  theatre of the world.  The crusade had completely failed.  After a lapse  of scarce forty years, a third crusade began.  When a great idea is  firmly fixed in men's minds with the twofold sanction of duty and  feeling, many generations live and die in its service before efforts are  exhausted and the end reached or abandoned.    During this forty years' interval between the end of the second and  beginning of the third crusade, the relative positions of West and East,  Christian Europe and Mussulman Asia, remained the same outwardly and  according to the general aspect of affairs; but in Syria and in Palestine  there was a continuance of the struggle between Christendom and Islamry,  with various fortunes on either side.  The Christian kingdom of Jerusalem  still stood; and after Godfrey de Bouillon, from 1100 to 1180, there had  been a succession of eight kings; some energetic and bold, aspiring to  extend their young dominion, others indolent and weak upon a tottering  throne.  The rivalries and often the defections and treasons of the petty  Christian princes and lords who were set up at different points in  Palestine and Syria endangered their common cause.  Fortunately similar  rivalries, dissensions, and treasons prevailed amongst the Mussulman  emirs, some of them Turks and others Persians or Arabs, and at one time  foes, at another dependants, of the Khalifs of Bagdad or of Egypt.  Anarchy and civil war harassed both races and both religions with almost  equal impartiality.  But, beneath this surface of simultaneous agitation  and monotony, great changes were being accomplished or preparing for  accomplishment in the West.  The principal sovereigns of the preceding  generation, Louis VII., King of France, Conrad III., Emperor of Germany,  and Henry II., King of England, were dying; and princes more juvenile and  more enterprising, or simply less wearied out,--Philip Augustus,  Frederick Barbarossa, and Richard Coeur de Lion,--were taking their  places.  In the East the theatre of policy and events was being enlarged;  Egypt was becoming the goal of ambition with the chiefs, Christian or  Mussulman, of Eastern Asia; and Damietta, the key of Egypt, was the  object of their enterprises, those of Amaury I., the boldest of the kings  of Jerusalem, as well as those of the Sultans of Damascus and Aleppo.  Noureddin and Saladin (Nour-Eddyn and Sala-Eddyn), Turks by origin, had  commenced their fortunes in Syria; but it was in Egypt that they  culminated, and, when Saladin became the most illustrious as well as the  most powerful of Mussulman sovereigns, it was with the title of Sultan of  Egypt and of Syria that he took his place in history.    In the course of the year 1187, Europe suddenly heard tale upon tale  about the repeated disasters of the Christians in Asia.  On the 1st of  May, the two religious and warlike orders which had been founded in the  East for the defence of Christendom--the Hospitallers of St. John of  Jerusalem and the Templars--lost, at a brush in Galilee, five hundred of  their bravest knights.  On the 3d and 4th of July, near Tiberias, a  Christian army was surrounded by the Saracens, and also, ere long, by the  fire which Saladin had ordered to be set to the dry grass which covered  the plain.  The flames made their way and spread beneath the feet of men  and horses.  \"There,\" say the Oriental chroniclers, \"the sons of Paradise  and the children of fire settled their terrible quarrel.  Arrows hurtled  in the air like a noisy flight of sparrows, and the blood of warriors  dripped upon the ground like rain-water.\"  \"I saw,\" adds one of them who  was present at the battle, \"hill, plain, and valley covered with their  dead; I saw their banners stained with dust and blood; I saw their heads  laid low, their limbs scattered, their carcasses piled on a heap like  stones.\"  Four days after the battle of Tiberias, on the 8th of July,  1187, Saladin took possession of St. Jean d'Acre, and, on the 4th of  September following, of Ascalon.  Finally, on the 18th of September, he  laid siege to Jerusalem, wherein refuge had been sought by a multitude of  Christian families driven from their homes by the ravages of the infidels  throughout Palestine; and the Holy City contained at this time, it is  said, nearly one hundred thousand Christians.  On approaching its walls,  Saladin sent for the principal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#4)"],[1,"were present were of the same opinion.  The  king, without further waiting, thanked his uncles for the care they had  taken of his dominions and of himself, and begged them to continue their  affection for him.  Neither the Duke of Burgundy nor the Duke of Berry  had calculated upon this resolution; they submitted, without making any  objection, but not without letting a little temper leak out.  The Duke of  Berry even said that he and his brother would beg the king to confer with  them more maturely on the subject when he returned to Paris.  Hereupon  the council broke up; the king's two uncles started for their own  dominions; and a few weeks afterwards the Cardinal-bishop of Laon died  of a short illness.  \"It was generally believed,\" says the monk of St.  Denis, \"that he died of poison.\"  At his own dying wish, no inquiry was  instituted on this subject.  The measure adopted in the late council was,  however, generally approved of.  The king was popular; he had a good  heart, and courteous and gentle manners; he was faithful to his friends,  and affable to all; and the people liked to see him passing along the  streets.  On taking in hand the government, he recalled to it the former  advisers of his father, Charles V., Bureau de la Riviere, Le Mercier de  Noviant, and Le Begue de Vilaine, all men of sense and reputation.  The  taxes were diminished; the city of Paris recovered a portion of her  municipal liberties; there was felicitation for what had been obtained,  and there was hope of more.    Charles VI.  was not content with the satisfaction of Paris only; he  wished all his realm to have cognizance of and to profit by his  independence.  He determined upon a visit to the centre and the south of  France.  Such a trip was to himself, and to the princes and cities that  entertained him, a cause of enormous expense.  \"When the king stopped  anywhere, there were wanted for his own table, and for the maintenance of  his following, six oxen, eighty sheep, thirty calves, seven hundred  chickens, two hundred pigeons, and many other things besides.  The  expenses for the king were set down at two hundred and thirty livres a  day, without counting the presents which the large towns felt bound to  make him.\"  But Charles was himself magnificent even to prodigality, and  he delighted in the magnificence of which he was the object, without  troubling himself about their cost to himself.  Between 1389 and 1390,  for about six months, he travelled through Burgundy, the banks of the  Rhone, Languedoc, and the small principalities bordering on the Pyrenees.  Everywhere his progress was stopped for the purpose of presenting to him  petitions or expressing wishes before him.  At Nimes and Montpellier, and  throughout Languedoc, passionate representations were made to him  touching the bad government of his two uncles, the Dukes of Anjou and  Berry.  \"They had plundered and ruined,\" he was told, \"that beautiful and  rich province; there were five or six talliages a year; one was no sooner  over than another began; they had levied quite three millions of gold  from Villeneuve-d'Avignon to Toulouse.\"  Charles listened with feeling,  and promised to have justice done, and his father's old councillors, who  were in his train, were far from dissuading him.  The Duke of Burgundy,  seeing him start with them in his train, had testified his spite and  disquietude to the Duke of Berry, saying, \"Aha! there goes the king on a  visit to Languedoc, to hold an inquiry about those who have governed it.  For all his council be takes with him only La Riviere, Le Mercier,  Montaigu, and Le Begue de Vilaine.  What say you to that, my brother?\"  \"The king, our nephew, is young,\" answered the Duke of Berry: \"if he  trusts the new councillors he is taking, he will be deceived, and it will  end ill, as you will see.  As for the present, we must support him.  The  time will come when we will make those councillors, and the king himself,  rue it.  Let them do as they please, by God: we will return to our own  dominions.  We are none the less the two greatest in the kingdom, and so  long as we are united, none can do aught against us.\"    The future is a blank, as well to the anxieties as to the hopes of men.  The king's uncles were on the point of getting back the power which they  believed to be lost to them.  On the 13th of June, 1392, the constable,  Oliver de Clisson, was waylaid as he was returning home after a banquet  given by the king at the hostel of St. Paul.  The assassin was Peter de  Craon, cousin of John IV., Duke of Brittany.  He believed De Clisson to  be dead, and left him bathed in blood at a baker's door in the street  called Culture-Sainte-Catherine.  The king was just going to bed, when  one of his people came and said to him, \"Ah! sir, a great misfortune has  happened in Paris.\"  \"What, and to whom?\" said the king.  \"To your  constable, sir, who has just been slain.\"  \"Slain!\" cried Charles; \"and  by whom?\"  \"Nobody knows; but it was close by here, in St. Catherine  Street.\"  \"Lights! quick!\" said the king; \"I will go and see him;\" and he  set off, without waiting for his following.  When he entered the baker's  shop, De Clisson, grievously wounded, was just beginning to recover his  senses.  \"Ah! constable,\" said the king, \"and how do you feel?\"  \"Very  poorly, dear sir.\"  \"And who brought you to this pass?\"  \"Peter de Craon  and his accomplices; traitorously and without warning.\"  \"Constable,\"  said the king, \"never was anything so punished or dearly paid for as this  shall be; take thought for yourself, and have no further care; it is my  affair.\"  Orders were immediately given to seek out Peter de Craon, and  hurry on his trial.  He had taken refuge, first in his own castle of  Sable, and afterwards with the Duke of Brittany, who kept him concealed,  and replied to the king's envoys that he did not know where he was.  The  king proclaimed his intention of making war on the Duke of Brittany until  Peter de Craon should be discovered, and justice done to the constable.  Preparations for war were begun; and the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy  received orders to get ready for it, themselves and their vassals.  The  former, who happened to be in Paris at the time of the attack, did not  care to directly oppose the king's project; but he evaded, delayed, and  predicted a serious war.  According to Froissart, he had been warned, the  morning before the attack, by a simple cleric, of Peter de Craon's  design; but, \"It is too late in the day,\" he had said; \"I do not like to  trouble the king to-day; to-morrow, without fail, we will see to it.\"  He  had, however, forgotten or neglected to speak to his nephew.  Neither he  nor his brother, the Duke of Burgundy, there is reason to suppose, were  accomplices in the attack upon De Clisson, but they were not at all sorry  for it.  It was to them an incident in the strife begun between  themselves, princes of the blood royal, and those former councillors of  Charles V., and now, again, of Charles VI., whom, with the impertinence  of great lords, they were wont to call the marinosettes.  They left  nothing undone to avert the king's anger and to preserve the Duke of  Brittany from the war which was threatening him.    Charles VI.'s excitement was very strong, and endured forever.  He  pressed forward eagerly his preparations for war, though attempts were  made to appease him.  He was recommended to take care of himself; for he  had been ill, and could scarcely mount his horse; and the Duke of  Burgundy remonstrated with him several times on the fatigue he was  incurring.  \"I find it better for me,\" he answered, \"to be on horseback,  or working at my council, than to keep resting.  Whoso wishes to persuade  me otherwise is not of my friends, and is displeasing to me.\"  A letter  from the Queen of Arragon gave some ground for supposing that Peter de  Craon had taken refuge in Spain; and the Duke of Burgundy took advantage  of it to dissuade the king from his prompt departure for the war in  Brittany.  \"At the very least,\" he said, \"it was right to send to Arragon  to know the truth of the matter, and to thank the queen for her  courtesy.\"  \"We are quite willing, uncle,\" answered Charles: \"you need  not be vexed; but for my own part I hold that this traitor of a Peter de  Craon is in no other prison and no other Barcelona than there is in being  quite comfortable at the Duke of Brittany's.\"  There was no way of  deterring him from his purpose.  He had got together his uncles and his  troops at Le Mans; and, after passing three weeks there, he gave the word  to march for Brittany.  The tragic incident which at that time occurred  has nowhere been more faithfully or better narrated than in M. de  Barante's History of the Dukes of Burgundy.  \"It was,\" says he, \"the  beginning of August, 1392, during the hottest days of the year.  The sun  was blazing, especially in those sandy districts.  The king was on  horseback, clad in a short and tight dress called a jacket.  His was of  black velvet, and very oppressive.  On his head he wore a cap of scarlet  velvet, ornamented with a chaplet of large pearls, which the queen had  given him at his departure.  Behind him were two pages on horseback.  In  order not to incommode the king with dust, he was left to march almost  alone.  To the left of him were the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, some  paces in front, conversing together.  The Duke of Orleans, the Duke of  Bourbon, Sire de Coney, and some others were also in front, forming  another group.  Behind were Sires de Navarre, de Bar, d'Albret, d'Artois,  and many others in one pretty large troop.  They rode along in this  order, and had just entered the great forest of Le Mans, when all at once  there started from behind a tree by the road-side a tall man, with bare  head and feet, clad in a common white smock, who, dashing forward and  seizing the king's horse by the bridle, cried, 'Go no farther;"]]]
