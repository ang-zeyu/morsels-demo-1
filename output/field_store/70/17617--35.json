Every evening the clouds were piled upon one  another in such a way that we were continually expecting to see a  water-spout; it was generally not before midnight that the heavens  would gradually clear up, and allow us to admire the beautiful and  dazzling constellations of the South.    The captain told us that this was the fourteenth voyage he had made  to the Brazils, during which time he had always found the heat very  easily borne, and had never seen the sky otherwise than dull and  lowering.  He said that this was occasioned by the damp, unhealthy  coast of Guinea, the ill effects of which were perceptible much  further than where we then were, although the distance between us  was 350 miles.    In the tropics the quick transition from day to night is already  very perceptible; 35 or 40 minutes after the setting of the sun the  deepest darkness reigns around.  The difference in the length of day  and night decreases more and more the nearer you approach the  Equator.  At the Equator itself the day and night are of equal  duration.    All the 14th and 15th of August we sailed parallel with the Cape de  Verde Islands, from which we were not more than 23 miles distant,  but which, on account of the hazy state of the weather, we could not  see.    During this period we used to be much amused by small flocks of  flying-fish, which very often rose from the water so near the ship's  side that we were enabled to examine them minutely.  They are  generally of the size and colour of a herring; their side fins,  however, are longer and broader, and they have the power of  spreading and closing them like little wings.  They raise themselves  about twelve or fifteen feet above the water, and then, after flying  more than a distance of a hundred feet, dive down again for a moment  beneath the waves, to recommence directly afterwards:  this occurs  most frequently when they are pursued by bonitos or other foes.  When they were flying at some distance from the ship they really  looked like elegant birds.  We very frequently saw the bonitos also,  who were pursuing them, endeavour to raise themselves above the  water, but they seldom succeeded in raising more than their head.    It is very difficult to catch one of these little denizens of the  air, as they are to be secured neither by nets or hooks; but  sometimes the wind will drive them, during the night, upon the deck,  where they are discovered, in the morning, dead, not having  sufficient strength to raise themselves from dry places; in this way  I obtained a few specimens.    Today, August 15th, we enjoyed a most interesting sight.  We  happened, exactly at 12 o'clock, to be in the sun's zenith, and the  sunbeams fell so perpendicularly that every object was perfectly  shadowless.  We put books, chairs, ourselves in the sun, and were  highly delighted with this unusual kind of amusement.  Luckily we  had chanced to be at the right spot at the right time; had we, at  the same hour, been only one degree nearer or one degree further, we  should have lost the entire sight; when we saw it we were 14 degrees  6' (a minute is equal to a nautical mile).    All observations with the sextant {9} were out of the question until  we were once more some degrees from the zenith.    17th August.  Shoals of tunny-fish, (fish four and five feet long,  and belonging to the dolphin tribe,) were seen tumbling about the  ship.  A harpoon was quickly procured, and one of the sailors sent  out with it on the bowsprit; but whether he had bad luck, or was  unskilled in the art of harpooning, he missed his mark.  The most  wonderful part of the story, though, was that all the fish  disappeared as if by magic, and did not appear again for some days;  it seemed as if they had whispered and warned each other of the  threatened danger.    All the oftener, however, did we see another inhabitant of the sea,  namely, that beautiful mollusca, the physolida, called by the  sailors Portugiesisches Segel-schiff; (Portuguese sailing-ship.)  When floating upon the surface of the sea, with its long crest,  which it can elevate or depress at pleasure, it really resembles a  delicate tiny little sailing vessel.  I was very desirous of  catching one of these little creatures, but this could only be  effected by means of a net, which I had not got, nor had I either  needle or twine to make one.  Necessity, however, is the mother of  invention; so I manufactured a knitting needle of wood, unravelled  some thick string, and in a few hours possessed a net.  Very soon  afterwards a mollusca had been captured, and placed in a tub filled  with sea water.  The little creature's body is about six inches long  and two inches high; the crest extends over the whole of the back,  and in the middle, where it is highest, measures about an inch and a  half.  Both the crest and body are transparent, and appear as if  tinged with rose colour; from the belly, which is violet, are  suspended a number of threads or arms of the same colour.    I hung the little thing up to dry at the stern, outside the ship;  some of the threads reached down into the water (a depth of at least  twelve feet), but most of them fell off.  After the animal was dead,  the crest remained erect, and the body perfectly filled out, but the  beautiful rose colour gradually changed to white.    18th August.  Today we had a heavy thunder-storm, for which we were  very grateful, as it cooled the air considerably.  Between 1 and 2  degrees, or 3 degrees North latitude, frequent changes in the  weather are very common.  For instance, on the morning of the 20th  we were overtaken by a strong wind, which lashed up the sea to a  great height, and continued until evening, when it gave way to a  tropical shower, which we at home should call a perfect water-spout.  The deck was instantaneously transformed into a lake, while at the  same time the wind had so completely fallen that even the rudder  enjoyed a holiday.    This rain cost me a night's rest, for when I went to take possession  of my berth, I found the bed-clothes drenched through and through,  and was fain to content myself with a wooden bench for a couch.    On the 27th of August we got beyond these hostile latitudes, and  were received by the anxiously desired south-east trade wind, which  hurried us quickly on our voyage.    We were now very near the Equator, and, like all other travellers,  wished very much to see the celebrated constellations of the south.  I myself was most interested in the Southern Cross; and, as I could  not find it among the stars, I begged the captain to point it out to  me.  Both he and the first mate, however, said that they had never  heard of it, and the second mate was the only one to whom it did not  appear entirely unknown.  With his help, we really did discover in  the spangled firmament four stars, which had something of the form  of a somewhat crooked cross, but were certainly not remarkable in  themselves, nor did they excite the least enthusiasm amongst us.  A  most magnificent spectacle was, on the contrary, formed by Orion,  Jupiter, and Venus; the latter, indeed, shone so brilliantly that  her gleams formed a silver furrow across the waves.    The great frequency of falling stars is another fact that I cannot  corroborate.  They are, perhaps, more frequent than in cold  climates, but are far from being as common as is said:  and as for  their size, I saw only one which surpassed ours; and this appeared  about three times as large as an ordinary star.    For some days also we had now seen the Cape, or Magellan's Clouds,  and also the so-called Black Cloud.  The first are bright, and, like  the Milky Way, are formed of numberless small stars, invisible to  the naked eye; the latter presents a black appearance, and is said  to be produced by the absence of all stars whatever from this part  of the heavens.    All these different signs prepared us for the most interesting  moment of our voyage--namely, passing the line.    On the 29th of August, at 10 o'clock P.M., we saluted the southern  hemisphere for the first time.  A feeling nearly allied to pride  excited every one, but more especially those who crossed the line  for the first time.  We shook each other by the hand, and  congratulated one another mutually, as if we had done some great and  heroic deed.  One of the passengers had brought with him a bottle or  two of champagne to celebrate the event:  the corks sprang gaily in  the air, and with a joyful \"huzza,\" the health of the new hemisphere  was drunk.    No festivities took place among the crew.  This is at present the  case in most vessels, as such amusements seldom end without  drunkenness and disorder.  The sailors, however, could not let the  cabin-boy, who passed the line for the first time, go quite scot-  free; so he was well christened in a few buckets of salt water.    Long before passing the line, we passengers had frequently spoken of  all the sufferings and tortures we should be subjected to at the  Equator.  Every one had read or heard something exceedingly  horrible, which he duly communicated to all the rest.  One expected  headache or colic; a second had pictured to himself the sailors  falling down from exhaustion; a third dreaded such a fearful degree  of heat, that it would not only melt the pitch, {11} but would so  dry up the ship, that nothing but continual throwing water over it  could prevent its catching fire; while a fourth feared that all the  provisions would be spoilt, and ourselves nearly starved to death.    For my own part, I had already congratulated myself on the tragical  stories I should be able to present to my readers; I beheld them  shedding tears at the narration of the sufferings we had  experienced, and I already appeared to myself half a martyr.  Alas!  I was sadly deceived.  We all remained in perfectly good health; not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#4)"],[1,"led, lasting hospitality even in a hotel; this one did not; and as I  was accustomed to work in the room I slept in, at least when visiting, a  slight frown must have crept between my eyes.    \"Mabel has fitted a work-room for you just out of the library,\" said the  clairvoyant Frances.    \"No one will disturb you there, and you'll have fifteen thousand books  all catalogued within easy reach. There's a private staircase too. You  can breakfast in your room and slip down in your dressing gown if you  want to.\" She laughed. My spirits took a turn upwards as absurdly as  they had gone down.    \"And how are you?\" I asked, giving her a belated kiss. \"It's jolly to be  together again. I did feel rather lost without you, I'll admit.\"    \"That's natural,\" she laughed. \"I'm so glad.\"    She looked well and had country color in her cheeks. She informed me  that she was eating and sleeping well, going out for little walks with  Mabel, painting bits of scenery again, and enjoying a complete change  and rest; and yet, for all her brave description, the word somehow did  not quite ring true. Those last words in particular did not ring true.  There lay in her manner, just out of sight, I felt, this suggestion of  the exact reverse--of unrest, shrinking, almost of anxiety. Certain  small strings in her seemed over-tight. \"Keyed-up\" was the slang  expression that crossed my mind. I looked rather searchingly into her  face as she was telling me this.    \"Only--the evenings,\" she added, noticing my query, yet rather avoiding  my eyes, \"the evenings are--well, rather heavy sometimes, and I find it  difficult to keep awake.\"    \"The strong air after London makes you drowsy,\" I suggested, \"and you  like to get early to bed.\"    Frances turned and looked at me for a moment steadily. \"On the contrary,  Bill, I dislike going to bed--here. And Mabel goes so early.\" She said  it lightly enough, fingering the disorder upon my dressing table in such  a stupid way that I saw her mind was working in another direction  altogether. She looked up suddenly with a kind of nervousness from the  brush and scissors.    \"Billy,\" she said abruptly, lowering her voice, \"isn't it odd, but I  hate sleeping alone here? I can't make it out quite; I've never felt  such a thing before in my life. Do you--think it's all nonsense?\"    And she laughed, with her lips but not with her eyes; there was a note  of defiance in her I failed to understand.    \"Nothing a nature like yours feels strongly is nonsense, Frances,\" I  replied soothingly.    But I, too, answered with my lips only, for another part of my mind was  working elsewhere, and among uncomfortable things. A touch of  bewilderment passed over me. I was not certain how best to continue. If  I laughed she would tell me no more, yet if I took her too seriously the  strings would tighten further. Instinctively, then, this flashed rapidly  across me: that something of what she felt, I had also felt, though  interpreting it differently. Vague it was, as the coming of rain or  storm that announce themselves hours in advance with their hint of  faint, unsettling excitement in the air. I had been but a short hour in  the house--big, comfortable, luxurious house--but had experienced this  sense of being unsettled, unfixed, fluctuating--a kind of impermanence  that transient lodgers in hotels must feel, but that a guest in a  friend's home ought not to feel, be the visit short or long. To Frances,  an impressionable woman, the feeling had come in the terms of alarm. She  disliked sleeping alone, while yet she longed to sleep. The precise idea  in my mind evaded capture, merely brushing through me, three-quarters  out of sight; I realized only that we both felt the same thing, and that  neither of us could get at it clearly.    Degrees of unrest we felt, but the actual thing did not disclose itself.  It did not happen.    I felt strangely at sea for a moment. Frances would interpret hesitation  as endorsement, and encouragement might be the last thing that could  help her.    \"Sleeping in a strange house,\" I answered at length, \"is often difficult  at first, and one feels lonely. After fifteen months in our tiny flat  one feels lost and uncared-for in a big house. It's an uncomfortable  feeling--I know it well. And this is a barrack, isn't it? The masses of  furniture only make it worse. One feels in storage somewhere  underground--the furniture doesn't furnish. One must never yield to  fancies, though--\"    Frances looked away towards the windows; she seemed disappointed a  little.    \"After our thickly-populated Chelsea,\" I went on quickly, \"it seems  isolated here.\"    But she did not turn back, and clearly I was saying the wrong thing. A  wave of pity rushed suddenly over me. Was she really frightened,  perhaps? She was imaginative, I knew, but never moody; common sense was  strong in her, though she had her times of hypersensitiveness. I caught  the echo of some unreasoning, big alarm in her. She stood there, gazing  across my balcony towards the sea of wooded country that spread dim and  vague in the obscurity of the dusk. The deepening shadows entered the  room, I fancied, from the grounds below. Following her abstracted gaze a  moment, I experienced a curious sharp desire to leave, to escape. Out  yonder was wind and space and freedom. This enormous building was  oppressive, silent, still.    Great catacombs occurred to me, things beneath the ground, imprisonment  and capture. I believe I even shuddered a little.    I touched her shoulder. She turned round slowly, and we looked with a  certain deliberation into each other's eyes.    \"Fanny,\" I asked, more gravely than I intended, \"you are not frightened,  are you? Nothing has happened, has it?\"    She replied with emphasis, \"Of course not! How could it--I mean, why  should I?\" She stammered, as though the wrong sentence flustered her a  second. \"It's simply--that I have this ter--this dislike of sleeping  alone.\"    Naturally, my first thought was how easy it would be to cut our visit  short. But I did not say this. Had it been a true solution, Frances  would have said it for me long ago.    \"Wouldn't Mabel double-up with you?\" I said instead, \"or give you an  adjoining room, so that you could leave the door between you open?  There's space enough, heaven knows.\"    And then, as the gong sounded in the hall below for dinner, she said, as  with an effort, this thing:    \"Mabel did ask me--on the third night--after I had told her. But I  declined.\"    \"You'd rather be alone than with her?\" I asked, with a certain relief.    Her reply was so gravely given, a child would have known there was more  behind it: \"Not that; but that she did not really want it.\"    I had a moment's intuition and acted on it impulsively. \"She feels it  too, perhaps, but wishes to face it by herself--and get over it?\"    My sister bowed her head, and the gesture made me realize of a sudden  how grave and solemn our talk had grown, as though some portentous thing  were under discussion. It had come of itself--indefinite as a gradual  change of temperature. Yet neither of us knew its nature, for apparently  neither of us could state it plainly. Nothing happened, even in our  words.    \"That was my impression,\" she said, \"--that if she yields to it she  encourages it. And a habit forms so easily. Just think,\" she added with  a faint smile that was the first sign of lightness she had yet betrayed,  \"what a nuisance it would be--everywhere--if everybody was afraid of  being alone--like that.\"    I snatched readily at the chance. We laughed a little, though it was a  quiet kind of laughter that seemed wrong. I took her arm and led her  towards the door.    \"Disastrous, in fact,\" I agreed.    She raised her voice to its normal pitch again, as I had done. \"No doubt  it will pass,\" she said, \"now that you have come. Of course, it's  chiefly my imagination.\" Her tone was lighter, though nothing could  convince me that the matter itself was light--just then. \"And in any  case,\" tightening her grip on my arm as we passed into the bright  enormous corridor and caught sight of Mrs. Franklyn waiting in the  cheerless hall below, \"I'm very glad you're here, Bill, and Mabel, I  know, is too.\"    \"If it doesn't pass,\" I just had time to whisper with a feeble attempt  at jollity, \"I'll come at night and snore outside your door. After that  you'll be so glad to get rid of me that you won't mind being alone.\"    \"That's a bargain,\" said Frances.    I shook my hostess by the hand, made a banal remark about the long  interval since last we met, and walked behind them into the great dining  room, dimly lit by candles, wondering in my heart how long my sister and  I should stay, and why in the world we had ever left our cozy little  flat to enter this desolation of riches and false luxury at all. The  unsightly picture of the late Samuel Franklyn, Esq., stared down upon me  from the farther end of the room above the mighty mantelpiece.    He looked, I thought, like some pompous Heavenly Butler who denied to  all the world, and to us in particular, the right of entry without  presentation cards signed by his hand as proof that we belonged to his  own exclusive set. The majority, to his deep grief, and in spite of all  his prayers on their behalf, must burn and \"perish everlastingly.\"          Chapter IV      With the instinct of the healthy bachelor I always try to make myself a  nest in the place I live in, be it for long or short.
