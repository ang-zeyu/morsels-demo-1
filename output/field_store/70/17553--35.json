You're the first man I've ever seen who could make me stop  and look twice. I need a fellow like you, but first I've got to make  you my man. The best colt in the world is no good until he learns to  take the whip without bucking. I'm going to get you used to the whip.  This is frank talk, eh? Well, I'm a frank man. You're in the harness  now, Harrigan; make up your mind: Will you pull or will you balk? Answer  me!\"    \"I'll see you damned!\"    \"Good. You've started to balk, so now you'll have to feel the whip.\"    He pulled a cord, and while they waited, the relentless duel of the  eyes continued. A flash of instinct like a woman's intuition told  Harrigan what impulse was moving McTee. He knew it was the same thing  which makes the small schoolboy fight with the stranger; the same  curiosity as to the unknown power, the same relentless will to be  master, but now intensified a thousandfold in McTee, who looked for the  first time, perhaps, on a man who might be his master. Harrigan knew,  and smiled. He was confident. He half rejoiced in looking forward to  the long struggle.    A knock came and the door opened.    \"Masters,\" said McTee to the boatswain, \"we're three hands short.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Here are the three hands. Take them forward.\"          CHAPTER 3      Masters looked at Harrigan, started to laugh, looked again, and then  silently held the door open. Harrigan stepped through it and followed  to the forecastle, a dingy retreat in the high bow of the ship. He had  to bend low to pass through the door, and inside he found that he could  not stand erect. It was his first experience of working aboard a ship,  and he expected to find a scrupulous neatness, and hammocks in place of  beds. Instead he looked on a double row of bunks heaped with swarthy  quilts, and the boatswain with a silent gesture indicated that one of  these belonged to Harrigan. He went to it without a word and sat down  cross-legged to survey his new quarters. It was more like the bunkhouse  of a western ranch than anything else he had been in, but all reduced  to a miniature, cramped and confined.    Now his eyes grew accustomed to the dim, unpleasant light which came  from a single lantern hanging on the central post, and he began to make  out the faces of the sailors. An oily-skinned Greek squatted on the  bunk to his left. To his right was a Chinaman, marvelously emaciated;  his lips pulled back in a continual smile, meaningless, like the grin  of a corpse.    Opposite was the inevitable Englishman, slender, good-looking, with  pale hair and bright, active eyes. Harrigan had traveled over half the  world and never failed to find at least one subject of John Bull in any  considerable group of men. This young fellow was talking with a giant  Negro, his neighbor. The black man chattered with enthusiasm while the  Englishman listened, nodding, intent.    One thing at least was certain about this crew: the Negro, the  Chinaman, the Greek, even the Englishman, despite his slender build,  they were all hard, strong men.    The cook brought out supper in buckets--stews, chunks of stale bread,  tea. As they ate, the sailors grew talkative.    \"Slide the slum this way,\" said the Englishman.    The Negro pushed the bucket across the deck with his foot.    \"A hard trip,\" went on the first speaker.    \"All trips on the _Mary Rogers_ is hard,\" rumbled a voice.    \"Aye, but Black McTee is blacker'n ever today.\"    \"He belted the bos'n with a rope end,\" commented the Negro.    \"He ain't human. This is my last trip with him. How about you, John?  You got a lump on your jaw yet where he cracked you for breakin' that  truck.\"    This was to the Chinaman, who answered in a soft guttural as if there  were bubbling oil in his throat: \"Me sail two year Black McTee, an'--\"    To finish his speech he passed a tentative hand across his swollen jaw.    \"And you'll sail with him till you die, John,\" said the Englishman.  \"When a man has had Black McTee for a boss, he'll want no other. He's  to other captains what whisky is to beer.\"    The white teeth of the Negro showed. \"Maybe Black McTee won't live  long,\" he suggested.    There was a long silence. It lasted until the supper was finished. It  lasted until the men slid into their bunks. And Harrigan knew that  every man was repeating slowly to himself: \"Maybe Black McTee won't  live long.\"    \"Not if this gang goes after him,\" muttered Harrigan, \"and yet--\"    He remembered the fight in Ivilei and the heaving shoulders which  showed above the heads of the swarming soldiers. With that picture in  his mind he went to sleep.    They were far out of sight of land in the morning and loafing south  before the trade wind, with a heavy ground swell kicking them along  from behind. Harrigan saw the _Mary Rogers_ plainly for the first time.  She was small, not more than fifteen hundred or two thousand tons, and  the dingiest, sootiest of all tramp freighters. He had little time to  make observations.    In the first place all hands washed down the decks, some of the men in  rubber boots, the others barefooted, with their trousers rolled up  above the knees. Harrigan was one of this number. The cool water from  the hose swished pleasantly about his toes. He began to think better of  life at sea as the wind blew from his nostrils the musty odors of the  forecastle. Then the bos'n, with the suggestion of a grin in his eyes,  ordered him up to scrub the bridge. He climbed the steps with a bucket  in one hand and a brush in the other. There stood McTee leaning against  the wheelhouse and staring straight ahead across the bows. He seemed  quite oblivious of his presence until, having finished his job,  Harrigan started back down the steps.    \"D'you call this clean?\" rumbled McTee. \"All over again!\"    And Harrigan dropped to his knees without protest and commenced  scrubbing again. As he worked, he hummed a tune and saw the narrow jaw  of McTee jut out. Harrigan smiled.    He had scarcely finished stowing his bucket and brush away when the  bos'n brought him word that he was wanted in the fireroom. Masters's  face was serious.    \"What's the main idea?\" asked Harrigan.    The bos'n cast a worried eye fore and aft.    \"Black McTee's breakin' you,\" he said; \"you're getting the whip.\"    \"Well?\"    \"God help you, that's all. Now get below.\"    There was a certain fervency about this speech which impressed even  Harrigan. He brooded over it on his way to the fireroom. There he was  set to work passing coal. He had to stand in a narrow passage scarcely  wide enough for him to turn about in. On either side was a towering  black heap which slanted down to his feet. Midway between the piles was  the little door through which he shoveled the coal into the fireroom.    All was stifling hot, with a breath of coal dust and smoke to choke the  lungs. Even the Greek firemen sweated and cursed, though they were used  to that environment. An ordinary man might have succumbed simply to  that fiery, foul atmosphere. It was like a glimpse of hell, dark,  hopeless.    It was not the heat or the atmosphere which troubled Harrigan, but his  hands. His skin was puffed and soft from the scrubbing of the bridge.  Now as he grasped the rough wood of the short-handled scoop the  epidermis wore quickly and left his palms half raw. For a time he  managed to shift his grip, bringing new portions of his hands to bear  on the wood, but even this skin was worn away in time. When he finished  his shift, his hands were bleeding in places and raw in the palms.    As he came on deck, he tied them up with bits of soft waste in lieu of  a bandage and made no complaint, yet his fingers were trembling when he  ate supper that night. He caught the eyes of the rest of the crew  studying him with a cold calculation. They were estimating the strength  of his endurance and he knew at once that they had been through the  same trial one by one until they were broken.    He could see that they hated the captain and he wondered why they would  ship with him time and again. He watched their expressions when Black  McTee was mentioned, and then he understood. They were waiting for the  time when the captain should weaken. Then they would have their  revenge.    The second day was a repetition of the first. He began with scrubbing  down the bridge. The suds, strong with lye, ate shrewdly at his raw  hands. Still he hummed as he worked and watched McTee's frown grow  dark. When he was ordered below to the fireroom, he wrapped his hands  in the soft waste again. That helped him for a time, but after the  first two hours the waste matted and grew hard with perspiration and  blood. He had to throw it away and take the shovel handle against his  bare skin. He told himself that it was only a matter of time before  calluses would form, but what chance was there for a formation of  calluses when the water and suds softened his hands every morning?    On the third day he was a little more used to the torture. His hands  were hopelessly raw now, but still he made no complaint and stuck with  his task. That night he secured a rag and retreated to the stretch of  deck between the wheelhouse and the after-cabin, where he squatted  beside a bucket of water and washed his hands carefully. Both hands  were puffed and red; one of the creases in the left palm bled a steady  trickle. He washed them slowly, with infinite relish of the cool water,  until he felt that peculiar sensation which warns us that we are  watched by another eye.    He looked up to see a young woman standing above him at the rail of the  after-cabin. She had been watching him by the light from the window of  the wheelhouse.          CHAPTER 4      \"Let me bandage your hands,\" she said. \"I have some salve in my room.\"    Her voice was a balm to the troubled heart of Harrigan. His knotted  forehead relaxed.    \"Are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#3)"],[1,"in favor of the Jews  of Cyrene; but he initiated the worship of the Emperors, which  necessitated a conflict between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of  Caesar, and in the end destroyed the religious liberty that Julius  Caesar had given to the Empire. His aim was at once to foster the  veneration of the Imperial power and establish an Imperial worship that  should replace the effete paganism of his subjects. He made no attempt  to force this worship on the Jews, but its existence fanned the  prejudice against the one nation that refused to participate. And the  Jews could not but look with distrust on a government that \"derived its  authority from the deification of might, whereof the Emperor was the  incarnate principle.\"[3]    [Footnote 1: Philo, De Leg. ii. 507.]    [Footnote 2: Suetonius, Aug. 93.]    [Footnote 3: Schechter, Aspects of Rabbinic Theology, p. 108.]    Marcus Agrippa, the trusted minister of Augustus, was also an intimate  friend of Herod, and served to link the two courts. But on the death of  Herod, in 4 C.E., the friendship of Rome for the Idumean royal house was  modified. Archelaus, who claimed the whole succession, was appointed  simply as ethnarch of Judea, while Herod's two other sons, Philip and  Herod Antipas, divided the rest of his dominions. The Zealots, rid of  the powerful tyrant who had held them down, sought again to throw off  the hated yoke of Idumea, which, not without reason, they identified  with the yoke of Rome. With their watchword, \"No king but God,\" they  attempted to make Judea independent, and a fierce struggle, known as the  War of Varus, ensued. Jerusalem was stormed once again by Roman legions  before the Zealots were subdued. Archelaus was deposed by his masters  after a few years, and the province of Judea was placed under direct  Roman administration. The Roman procurator was at first less detested  than the Idumean tyrant, since he interfered less with the legal  institutions, such as the Sanhedrin and the Bet Din; but his presence  with the legionaries in the Holy City and his constant, though often  involuntary, affronts to the religious sentiments of the people roused  the hostility of the nationalist party, who looked forward to the day  when Israel should \"tread on the neck of the Eagle.\" The Pharisees, who  were anxious for the spiritual rather than the political independence of  the Jews, counseled submission to Rome, and were willing \"to render unto  Caesar the things that are Caesar's,\" so long as they were not compelled  to give up the Torah. But the Zealots desired political as well as  religious freedom, and they fomented rebellion. They have been compared  by Merivale to the Montagnards of the French Revolution, driven by their  own indomitable passion to assert the truths that possessed them with a  ferocity that no possession could justify. They were continually rousing  the people to expel the foreign rulers, and in the northern province of  Galilee, where they found shelter amid the wild tracts of heath and  mountain, they maintained a constant state of insurrection.[1]    [Footnote 1: It is important to notice that much of our knowledge of the  Zealots is derived from Josephus, who, as will be seen, set himself to  misrepresent them, and repeated the calumnies of hostile Roman writers  against them. The Talmud contains several references to them, describing  them as Kannaim (the Hebrew equivalent of Zealots), and it would appear  that they were in their outlook successors of the former Hasidim,  distinguished as much for their religious rigidity as their patriotic  fervor. See Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. Zealots.]    The Romans, on their side, accustomed to the ready submission of all the  peoples under their sway, could not understand or tolerate the Jews. To  them this people with its dour manners, its refusal to participate in  the religious ideas, the social life, and the pleasures of its  neighbors, its eruptions of passion and violence on account of abstract  ideas, and its rigid exclusion of the insignia of Roman majesty from the  capital, seemed the enemies of the human race. In their own religion  they had freely found a place for Greek and Egyptian deities, but the  Jewish faith, in its uncompromising opposition to all pagan worship,  seemed, in the words that Anatole France has put into the mouth of one  of the Roman procurators, to be rather an _ab_ligion than a _re_ligion,  an institution designed rather to sever the bond that united peoples,  than bind them together. Every other civilized people had accepted their  dominion; the Jews and the Parthians alone stood in the way of universal  peace. The near-Eastern question, which, then as now, continually  threatened war and violence, irritated the Romans beyond measure, and  they came to feel towards Jerusalem as their ancestors had felt two  hundred years before towards Carthage, the great Semitic power of the  West, _delenda est Hierosolyma_. As time went on they realized that this  stubborn nation was resolved to dispute with them for the mastery, and  every agitation was regarded as an outrage on the Roman power, which  must be wiped out in blood. It was the inevitable conflict, not only  between the Imperial and the national principle, but between the ideas  of the kingdom of righteousness and the ideas of the kingdom of might.    During the reign of Tiberius, however, the Roman governors were held in  check to some extent by strong central control from Rome, and their  extortion was comparatively moderate. The worst of them was Pontius  Pilate, and the _odium theologicum_ has, perhaps, had its part in  blackening his reputation. Nevertheless, the broad religious tolerance  initiated by the first Caesar was being continually impaired. The Jewish  public worship was prohibited in Rome, and the Jews were expelled from  the city in 19 C.E.; while at Alexandria an anti-Jewish persecution was  instigated by Sejanus, the upstart freedman, who became the chief  minister of Tiberius. In Palestine, though we hear of no definite  movement, it is clear from after-events that the bitterness of feeling  between the Hellenized Syrians and the Jewish population was steadily  fomented. The Romans were naturally on the side of the Greek-speaking  people, whom they understood, and whose religion they could appreciate.  The situation may best be paralleled by the condition of Ireland in the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when England supported the  Protestant population of Ulster against the hated Roman Catholics, who  formed the majority of the people.    It had been the aim of Tiberius to consolidate the unwieldy mass of the  Empire by the gradual absorption of the independent kingdoms inclosed  within its limits. In pursuance of this policy, Judea, Chalcis, and  Abilene, all parts of Herod's kingdom, had been placed under Roman  governors. But when Gaius Caligula succeeded Tiberius in 32 C.E., and  brought to the Imperial throne a capricious irresponsibility, he  reverted to the older policy of encouraging client-princes, and doled  out territories to his Oriental favorites. Prominent among them was  Agrippa, a grandson of Herod, who had passed his youth in the company of  the Roman prince in Italy. He received as the reward of his loyal  extravagance not only Judea but Galilee and Perea, together with the  title of king. He was not, however, given permission to repair to his  kingdom, since his patron desired his attentions at Rome. Later he was  detained by a sterner call. Gaius, who had passed from folly to lunacy,  was not content with the customary voluntary worship paid to the  Emperors, but imagined himself the supreme deity, and demanded  veneration from all his subjects. He ordered his image to be set up in  all temples, and, irritated by the petition of the Jews to be exempted  from what would be an offense against the first principle of their  religion, he insisted upon their immediate submission. In Alexandria the  Greek population made a violent attempt to carry out the Imperial order;  a sharp conflict took place, and the Jews in their dire need sent a  deputation, with Philo at its head, to supplicate the Emperor. In the  East the governor of Syria, Petronius, was directed to march on  Jerusalem and set up the Imperial statue in the Holy of Holies, whatever  it might cost. Petronius understood, and it seems respected, the  faithfulness of the Jews to their creed, and he hesitated to carry out  the command. From East and West the Jews gathered to resist the decree;  the multitude, says Philo, covered Phoenicia like a cloud. Meantime King  Agrippa at Rome interceded with the Emperor for his people, and induced  him to relent for a little. But the infatuation again came over Gaius;  he ordered Petronius peremptorily to do his will, and, when the legate  still dallied, sent to remove him from his office. But, as Philo says,  God heard the prayer of His people: Gaius was assassinated by a Roman  whom he had wantonly insulted, and the death-struggle with Rome, which  had threatened in Judea, was postponed. The year of trial, however, had  brought home to the whole of the Jewish people that the incessant moral  conflict with Rome might at any moment be resolved into a desperate  physical struggle for the preservation of their religion. And the  warlike party gained in strength.    The date of the death of Gaius (Shebat 22) was appointed as a day of  memorial in the Jewish calendar; and for a little time the Jews had a  respite from tyranny. Agrippa, who, after the murder of Gaius, played a  large part in securing for Claudius the succession to the Imperial  throne, was confirmed in the grant of his kingdom, and, despite his  antecedents and his upbringing, proved himself a model national king.  Perhaps he had seen through the rottenness of Rome, perhaps the trial of  Gaius' mad escapades had deepened his nature, and led him to honor the  burning faith of the"]]]
