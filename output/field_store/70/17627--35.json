The  parish oil lamps were like light-houses on the ocean; guides, not  lights; the gas has become a perpetual full moon; and it may assuredly  be pronounced one of the most splendid and valuable applications of  chemistry. Why has not old Murdoch his statue? He deserves it even  better than his master; for the master was well paid in solid pudding.  In other days, that statue would have equalled the Colossus at Rhodes,  and the demi-philosopher would have breathed flame like the Chimera; in  the fabulous ages before that, he would have come down to us a god, or a  demi-god, the rival of Prometheus, Hercules, and Atlas. Why not cast him  in Achillean brass, the rival of the great hero of gunpowder and  Waterloo, and make him breathe gas like the Dragon of Wantley, to  illuminate the triumphal arch. Ingrata Patria!    The new light! yes, much has been heard of its power and influence; but  what has the new light of all the preachers done for the morality and  order of London, compared to what has been effected by this new light.  Old Murdoch alone, has suppressed more vice than the Suppression  Society; and has been a greater police officer into the bargain than old  Colquhoun and Sir Richard Birnie united. It is not only that men are  afraid to be wicked when light is looking at them, but they are ashamed  also; the reformation is applied to the right place. Where does vice  resort? Where it can hide; in darkness, says the preacher, because its  deeds are deeds of darkness. Seek it in Pudding-lane, and Dyot-street,  and the abysses of Westminster. Why was not this new light preached to  them long ago: twenty bushels of it would have been of more value than  as many chaldrons of sermons, and taking even the explosions of the  inspector into the bargain. But it is well, that this is at length to be  compulsory; since it is never too late. Thieves and rogues are like  moths in blankets: bring the sun to shine on them, and they can neither  live nor breed. Let the Duke of Wellington place a gas-lamp at every  door of these infernal abodes; and since they cannot be smoked out, make  their houses as much like glass, on the principle of the old Roman, as  we can compass. This is the remedy; at least till common sense will  condescend to the better expedient of pulling down and laying open all  these retreats of misery and vice; the disgrace and the nuisance of  London, and not less a standing inhumanity to the poor  themselves.--_Westminster Review._           *       *       *       *       *      CAPE WINES.      The commerce at the Cape is wine; and the vine has already increased  tenfold, since the colony became British. But unfortunately more  attention has been hitherto paid to quantity than to quality, except on  the farms which yield Constantia. The latter have an eastern exposure,  and are sheltered from the south-west, the only injurious blast. The  soil being a deposit from the neighbouring mountains, is light, but  enriched by manure. The subsoil, which is even more important, is still  lighter, being mixed with sand and broken stone; on the contrary, in  Drachenstein, where the chief vineyards are at present, the subsoil  being clay, the wine receives an unpleasant flavour, the idea of which  is inseparably associated with the very name of Cape wine. It is  unnecessary to enter into the subject of its manufacture. If the subsoil  be bad, so will the wine be. The vine does not require a rich subsoil.  In Italy, flags are laid to prevent the roots from penetrating into  clay; and in England, rubbish is thrown in to make a subsoil that shall  not be so rich as to produce leaves, instead of fruit. It would be  advantageous were premiums offered for wine that had not been produced  from clay of subsoil, but had been reared in trellis, as requiring less  labour than the standard, and made on a pure and good system, instead of  being mixed with Cape brandy, or sulphuric acid, &c. Notwithstanding all  these disadvantages, Cape wine is generally sold in England under the  names, and at the prices, of Madeira, Sherry, Teneriffe, Stem, Pontac,  and above all, Hock.--_Gill's Repository._           *       *       *       *       *      A VIEW OF LONDON.      The finest view in London is from the top of Whitehall Place, looking  towards the river; but then you must see it as I did, at the same hour,  and under similar circumstances.    It was about a fortnight since I beheld that memorable spectacle. I was  on my way home, having dined with a friend, who, though not an habitual  votary of Bacchus, occasionally sacrifices to the god with intense and  absorbing zeal. After dinner we adjourned to the Opera, having only  determined to renew at supper our intimacy with certain flasks of  Champagne, which lay in their icy baths coolly expecting our return. We  carried our determination into effect to the fullest extent; and at  half-past three o'clock we parted, deeply impressed with a sense of each  other's good qualities, and with as keen and lively an appetite for the  sublime and beautiful as an X of Champagne[2] usually imparts to its  warm-hearted admirers. My way led me through Whitehall, at least I found  myself there, as \"Charles,\" the guardian of the night, was announcing  the fourth hour. As my good fortune would have it, I happened to look  towards the river, and never, while memory holds her seat, shall I  forget the sight which presented itself. Six distinct St. Pauls lifted  themselves through the cloudless morning air (so pure, that the smoke of  a single cigar would defile it: I extinguished mine in awe) towards the  blue transparent sky; nearer, and beneath this stately city of temples,  were four Waterloo Bridges, piling their long arcades in graceful and  harmonious regularity one above the other, with the chaste and lofty  symmetry of a mighty aqueduct; while far away, in the dim distance, a  dome of gigantic dimensions was faintly visible, as if presiding over  the scene, linking shadow and substance, uniting the material with the  intellectual world, like the realization of a grand architectural dream.  Talk not to me of the Eternal City--in her proudest days of imperial  magnificence she could not furnish such a view--thrice be that Champagne  lauded!--_Monthly Magazine._        [2] _Reader_--What does he mean by an X of Champagne?        _Editor_--An unknown quantity, you fool.           *       *       *       *       *      NEW YORK.      The distant view of New York, almost free from smoke, is singularly  bright and lively; in some respects it refreshes a recollection of the  sea-bound cities of the Mediterranean. The lower parts of the interior,  next to the warehouses, resemble Liverpool; but the boast of the city is  Broadway, a street that, for extent and beauty, the Trongate of Glasgow,  which it somewhat resembles in general effect, alone excels. The style  of the Trongate is, if the expression may be used, of a more massy and  magnificent character, but there is a lightness in that of Broadway  which most people will prefer. Those who compare the latter with  Oxford-street, in London, do it injustice; for, although the shops in  Oxford-street display a richer show of merchandize, the buildings are  neither of equal consequence nor magnitude. Regent-street in London, is  of course always excepted from comparisons of this kind.    The portico of the Bowery Theatre is immeasurably the finest _morceau_  of architecture in the city. It resembles that of Covent-Garden, but  seems to be nobler and greater; and yet I am not sure if, in point of  dimensions, it is larger, or so large as that of Covent-Garden. The only  objection to it--and my objection is stronger against the London  theatre--is the unfitness. In both cases, the style and order are of the  gravest Templar character, more appropriate to the tribunals of criminal  justice, than to the haunts of Cytherea and the Muses.--_New Monthly  Mag._           *       *       *       *       *      THE TRUE FORNARINA.      The account of a journey which was taken in the year 1664, by Cosmo, the  son of Ferdinand II. de Medici, was written at the time, by Philip  Pizzichi, his travelling chaplain. This work was published for the first  time at Florence, about seven months ago. It contains some curious  notices of persons and things, and among them, what will interest every  lover of the fine arts. It is this--speaking of Verona, he mentions the  Curtoni gallery of paintings, and says, \"The picture most worthy of  attention is the lady of Raffaello, so carefully finished by himself,  and so well preserved that it surpasses every other.\" The editor of  these travels has satisfactorily shown that Raffaelo's lady here  described is the true Fornarina; so that of the three likenesses of her  said to be executed by this eminent artist, the genuine one is the  Veronese, belonging to the Curtoni gallery, now in the possession of a  lady Cavellini Brenzoni, who obtained it by inheritance.--_Monthly  Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      ITALIAN SCENERY.      Happy is the man, who, leaving the Alps behind him, has the plains of  Lombardy on his right hand and on his left, the Apennines in view, and  Florence as the city towards which he directs his steps. His way is  through a country where corn grows under groves of fruit trees, whose  tops are woven into green arcades by thickly-clustering garlands of  vines; the dark masses of foliage and verdure which every where appear,  melt insensibly, as he advances, into a succession of shady bowers that  invite him to their depths; the scenery is monotonous, and yet ever  various from the richness of its sylvan beauty, possessing all the  softness of forest glades without their gloom.

And yesterday--was she out then?\"    \"No, I think not. Indeed, she goes out very little--her health is usually  bad. She was indoors, too, at the time of the Heath robbery, since you  ask. But come, now, I don't like this. It's ridiculous to suppose that  _she_ knows anything of it.\"    \"I don't suppose it, as I have said. I am only asking for information.  That is all your resident family, I take it, and you know nothing of  anybody else's movements--except, perhaps, Mr. Lloyd's?\"    \"Lloyd? Well, you know yourself that he was out with the ladies when the  first robbery took place. As to the others, I don't remember. Yesterday he  was probably in his room, writing. I think that acquits _him_, eh?\" Sir  James looked quizzically into the broad face of the affable detective, who  smiled and replied:    \"Oh, of course nobody can be in two places at once, else what would become  of the _alibi_ as an institution? But, as I have said, I am only setting  my facts in order. Now, you see, we get down to the servants--unless some  stranger is the party wanted. Shall we go outside now?\"    Lenton Croft was a large, desultory sort of house, nowhere more than three  floors high, and mostly only two. It had been added to bit by bit, till it  zigzagged about its site, as Sir James Norris expressed it, \"like a game  of dominoes.\" Hewitt scrutinized its external features carefully as they  strolled around, and stopped some little while before the windows of the  two bed-rooms he had just seen from the inside. Presently they approached  the stables and coach-house, where a groom was washing the wheels of the  dog-cart.    \"Do you mind my smoking?\" Hewitt asked Sir James. \"Perhaps you will take a  cigar yourself--they are not so bad, I think. I will ask your man for a  light.\"    Sir James felt for his own match-box, but Hewitt had gone, and was  lighting his cigar with a match from a box handed him by the groom. A  smart little terrier was trotting about by the coach-house, and Hewitt  stooped to rub its head. Then he made some observation about the dog,  which enlisted the groom's interest, and was soon absorbed in a chat with  the man. Sir James, waiting a little way off, tapped the stones rather  impatiently with his foot, and presently moved away.    For full a quarter of an hour Hewitt chatted with the groom, and, when at  last he came away and overtook Sir James, that gentleman was about  re-entering the house.    \"I beg your pardon, Sir James,\" Hewitt said, \"for leaving you in that  unceremonious fashion to talk to your groom, but a dog, Sir James--a good  dog--will draw me anywhere.\"    \"Oh!\" replied Sir James, shortly.    \"There is one other thing,\" Hewitt went on, disregarding the other's  curtness, \"that I should like to know: There are two windows directly  below that of the room occupied yesterday by Mrs. Cazenove--one on each  floor. What rooms do they light?\"    \"That on the ground floor is the morning-room; the other is Mr.  Lloyd's--my secretary. A sort of study or sitting-room.\"    \"Now you will see at once, Sir James,\" Hewitt pursued, with an affable  determination to win the baronet back to good-humor--\"you will see at once  that, if a ladder had been used in Mrs. Heath's case, anybody looking from  either of these rooms would have seen it.\"    \"Of course! The Scotland Yard man questioned everybody as to that, but  nobody seemed to have been in either of the rooms when the thing occurred;  at any rate, nobody saw anything.\"    \"Still, I think I should like to look out of those windows myself; it  will, at least, give me an idea of what _was_ in view and what was not, if  anybody had been there.\"    Sir James Norris led the way to the morning-room. As they reached the door  a young lady, carrying a book and walking very languidly, came out. Hewitt  stepped aside to let her pass, and afterward said interrogatively: \"Miss  Norris, your daughter, Sir James?\"    \"No, my niece. Do you want to ask her anything? Dora, my dear,\" Sir James  added, following her in the corridor, \"this is Mr. Hewitt, who is  investigating these wretched robberies for me. I think he would like to  hear if you remember anything happening at any of the three times.\"    The lady bowed slightly, and said in a plaintive drawl: \"I, uncle? Really,  I don't remember anything; nothing at all.\"    \"You found Mrs. Armitage's door locked, I believe,\" asked Hewitt, \"when  you tried it, on the afternoon when she lost her brooch?\"    \"Oh, yes; I believe it was locked. Yes, it was.\"    \"Had the key been left in?\"    \"The key? Oh, no! I think not; no.\"    \"Do you remember anything out of the common happening--anything whatever,  no matter how trivial--on the day Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet?\"    \"No, really, I don't. I can't remember at all.\"    \"Nor yesterday?\"    \"No, nothing. I don't remember anything.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Hewitt, hastily; \"thank you. Now the morning-room, Sir  James.\"    In the morning-room Hewitt stayed but a few seconds, doing little more  than casually glance out of the windows. In the room above he took a  little longer time. It was a comfortable room, but with rather effeminate  indications about its contents. Little pieces of draped silk-work hung  about the furniture, and Japanese silk fans decorated the mantel-piece.  Near the window was a cage containing a gray parrot, and the writing-table  was decorated with two vases of flowers.    \"Lloyd makes himself pretty comfortable, eh?\" Sir James observed. \"But it  isn't likely anybody would be here while he was out, at the time that  bracelet went.\"    \"No,\" replied Hewitt, meditatively. \"No, I suppose not.\"    He stared thoughtfully out of the window, and then, still deep in thought,  rattled at the wires of the cage with a quill toothpick and played a  moment with the parrot. Then, looking up at the window again, he said:  \"That is Mr. Lloyd, isn't it, coming back in a fly?\"    \"Yes, I think so. Is there anything else you would care to see here?\"    \"No, thank you,\" Hewitt replied; \"I don't think there is.\"    They went down to the smoking-room, and Sir James went away to speak to  his secretary. When he returned, Hewitt said quietly: \"I think, Sir  James--I _think_ that I shall be able to give you your thief presently.\"    \"What! Have you a clue? Who do you think? I began to believe you were  hopelessly stumped.\"    \"Well, yes. I have rather a good clue, although I can't tell you much  about it just yet. But it is so good a clue that I should like to know now  whether you are determined to prosecute when you have the criminal?\"    \"Why, bless me, of course,\" Sir James replied, with surprise. \"It doesn't  rest with me, you know--the property belongs to my friends. And even if  they were disposed to let the thing slide, I shouldn't allow it--I  couldn't, after they had been robbed in my house.\"    \"Of course, of course! Then, if I can, I should like to send a message to  Twyford by somebody perfectly trustworthy--not a servant. Could anybody  go?\"    \"Well, there's Lloyd, although he's only just back from his journey. But,  if it's important, he'll go.\"    \"It is important. The fact is we must have a policeman or two here this  evening, and I'd like Mr. Lloyd to fetch them without telling anybody  else.\"    Sir James rang, and, in response to his message, Mr. Lloyd appeared. While  Sir James gave his secretary his instructions, Hewitt strolled to the door  of the smoking-room, and intercepted the latter as he came out.    \"I'm sorry to give you this trouble, Mr. Lloyd,\" he said, \"but I must stay  here myself for a little, and somebody who can be trusted must go. Will  you just bring back a police-constable with you? or rather two--two would  be better. That is all that is wanted. You won't let the servants know,  will you? Of course there will be a female searcher at the Twyford  police-station? Ah--of course. Well, you needn't bring her, you know. That  sort of thing is done at the station.\" And, chatting thus confidentially,  Martin Hewitt saw him off.    When Hewitt returned to the smoking-room, Sir James said, suddenly: \"Why,  bless my soul, Mr. Hewitt, we haven't fed you! I'm awfully sorry. We came  in rather late for lunch, you know, and this business has bothered me so I  clean forgot everything else. There's no dinner till seven, so you'd  better let me give you something now. I'm really sorry. Come along.\"    \"Thank you, Sir James,\" Hewitt replied; \"I won't take much. A few  biscuits, perhaps, or something of that sort. And, by the by, if you don't  mind, I rather think I should like to take it alone. The fact is I want to  go over this case thoroughly by myself. Can you put me in a room?\"    \"Any room you like. Where will you go? The dining-room's rather large, but  there's my study, that's pretty snug, or----\"    \"Perhaps I can go into Mr. Lloyd's room for half an hour or so; I don't  think he'll mind, and it's pretty comfortable.\"    \"Certainly, if you'd like. I'll tell them to send you whatever they've  got.\"    \"Thank you very much. Perhaps they'll also send me a lump of sugar and a  walnut; it's--it's a little fad of mine.\"    \"A--what? A lump of sugar and a walnut?\" Sir James stopped for a moment,  with his hand on the bell-rope. \"Oh, certainly, if you'd like it;  certainly,\" he added, and stared after this detective with curious tastes  as he left the room.    When the vehicle, bringing back the secretary and the policeman, drew up  on the drive, Martin Hewitt left the room on the first floor and proceeded  down-stairs. On the landing he met Sir James Norris and Mrs. Cazenove, who  stared with astonishment on perceiving that the detective carried in his  hand the parrot-cage.    \"I think our business is about brought to a head now,\" Hewitt remarked, on  the stairs. \"Here are the police officers from Twyford.\" The men were  standing"]]]
