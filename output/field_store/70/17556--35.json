It was near the close of the year 1780 that a solitary traveler was seen  pursuing his way through one of the numerous little valleys of  Westchester. [Footnote: As each state of the American Union has its own  counties, it often happens that there are several which bear the same  name. The scene of this tale is in New York, whose county of Westchester  is the nearest adjoining to the city.] The easterly wind, with its  chilling dampness and increasing violence, gave unerring notice of the  approach of a storm, which, as usual, might be expected to continue for  several days; and the experienced eye of the traveler was turned in  vain, through the darkness of the evening, in quest of some convenient  shelter, in which, for the term of his confinement by the rain that  already began to mix with the atmosphere in a thick mist, he might  obtain such accommodations as his purposes required. Nothing whatever  offered but the small and inconvenient tenements of the lower order of  the inhabitants, with whom, in that immediate neighborhood, he did not  think it either safe or politic to trust himself.    The county of Westchester, after the British had obtained possession of  the island of New York, [Footnote: The city of New York is situated on  an island called Manhattan: but it is at one point separated from the  county of Westchester by a creek of only a few feet in width. The bridge  at this spot is called King's Bridge. It was the scene of many  skirmishes during the war, and is alluded to in this tale. Every  Manhattanese knows the difference between \"Manhattan Island\" and the  \"island of Manhattan.\" The first is applied to a small District in the  vicinity of Corlaer's Hook, while the last embraces the Whole island; or  the city and county of New York as it is termed in the laws.] became  common ground, in which both parties continued to act for the remainder  of the war of the Revolution. A large proportion of its inhabitants,  either restrained by their attachments, or influenced by their fears,  affected a neutrality they did not feel. The lower towns were, of  course, more particularly under the dominion of the crown, while the  upper, finding a security from the vicinity of the continental troops,  were bold in asserting their revolutionary opinions, and their right to  govern themselves. Great numbers, however, wore masks, which even to  this day have not been thrown aside; and many an individual has gone  down to the tomb, stigmatized as a foe to the rights of his countrymen,  while, in secret, he has been the useful agent of the leaders of the  Revolution; and, on the other hand, could the hidden repositories of  divers flaming patriots have been opened to the light of day, royal  protections would have been discovered concealed under piles of  British gold.    At the sound of the tread of the noble horse ridden by the traveler, the  mistress of the farmhouse he was passing at the time might be seen  cautiously opening the door of the building to examine the stranger; and  perhaps, with an averted face communicating the result of her  observations to her husband, who, in the rear of the building, was  prepared to seek, if necessary, his ordinary place of concealment in the  adjacent woods. The valley was situated about midway in the length of  the county, and was sufficiently near to both armies to make the  restitution of stolen goods no uncommon occurrence in that vicinity. It  is true, the same articles were not always regained; but a summary  substitute was generally resorted to, in the absence of legal justice,  which restored to the loser the amount of his loss, and frequently with  no inconsiderable addition for the temporary use of his property. In  short, the law was momentarily extinct in that particular district, and  justice was administered subject to the bias of personal interests and  the passions of the strongest.    The passage of a stranger, with an appearance of somewhat doubtful  character, and mounted on an animal which, although unfurnished with any  of the ordinary trappings of war, partook largely of the bold and  upright carriage that distinguished his rider, gave rise to many  surmises among the gazing inmates of the different habitations; and in  some instances, where conscience was more than ordinarily awake, to no  little alarm.    Tired with the exercise of a day of unusual fatigue, and anxious to  obtain a speedy shelter from the increasing violence of the storm, that  now began to change its character to large drops of driving rain, the  traveler determined, as a matter of necessity, to make an application  for admission to the next dwelling that offered. An opportunity was not  long wanting; and, riding through a pair of neglected bars, he knocked  loudly at the outer door of a building of a very humble exterior,  without quitting his saddle. A female of middle age, with an outward  bearing but little more prepossessing than that of her dwelling,  appeared to answer the summons. The startled woman half closed her door  again in affright, as she saw, by the glare of a large wood fire, a  mounted man so unexpectedly near its threshold; and an expression of  terror mingled with her natural curiosity, as she required his pleasure.    Although the door was too nearly closed to admit of a minute scrutiny of  the accommodations within, enough had been seen to cause the horseman to  endeavor, once more, to penetrate the gloom, with longing eyes, in  search of a more promising roof, before, with an ill-concealed  reluctance, he stated his necessities and wishes. His request was  listened to with evident unwillingness, and, while yet unfinished, it  was eagerly interrupted by the reply:    \"I can't say I like to give lodgings to a stranger in these ticklish  times,\" said the female, in a pert, sharp key. \"I'm nothing but a  forlorn lone body; or, what's the same thing, there's nobody but the old  gentleman at home; but a half mile farther up the road is a house where  you can get entertainment, and that for nothing. I am sure 'twill be  much convenienter to them, and more agreeable to me--because, as I said  before, Harvey is away; I wish he'd take advice, and leave off  wandering; he's well to do in the world by this time; and he ought to  leave off his uncertain courses, and settle himself, handsomely, in  life, like other men of his years and property. But Harvey Birch will  have his own way, and die vagabond after all!\"    The horseman did not wait to hear more than the advice to pursue his  course up the road; but he had slowly turned his horse towards the bars,  and was gathering the folds of an ample cloak around his manly form,  preparatory to facing the storm again, when something in the speech of  the female suddenly arrested the movement.    \"Is this, then, the dwelling of Harvey Birch?\" he inquired, in an  involuntary manner, apparently checking himself, as he was about to  utter more.    \"Why, one can hardly say it is his dwelling,\" replied the other, drawing  a hurried breath, like one eager to answer; \"he is never in it, or so  seldom, that I hardly remember his face, when he does think it worth his  while to show it to his poor old father and me. But it matters little to  me, I'm sure, if he ever comes back again, or not;--turn in the first  gate on your left;--no, I care but little, for my part, whether Harvey  ever shows his face again or not--not I\"--and she closed the door  abruptly on the horseman, who gladly extended his ride a half mile  farther, to obtain lodgings which promised both more comfort and  greater security.    Sufficient light yet remained to enable the traveler to distinguish the  improvements [Footnote: Improvements is used by the Americans to express  every degree of change in converting land from its state of wilderness  to that of cultivation. In this meaning of the word, it is an  improvement to fell the trees; and it is valued precisely by the  supposed amount of the cost.] which had been made in the cultivation,  and in the general appearance of the grounds around the building to  which he was now approaching. The house was of stone, long, low, and  with a small wing at each extremity. A piazza, extending along the  front, with neatly turned pillars of wood, together with the good order  and preservation of the fences and outbuildings, gave the place an air  altogether superior to the common farmhouses of the country. After  leading his horse behind an angle of the wall, where it was in some  degree protected from the wind and rain, the traveler threw his valise  over his arm, and knocked loudly at the entrance of the building for  admission. An aged black soon appeared; and without seeming to think it  necessary, under the circumstances, to consult his superiors,--first  taking one prying look at the applicant, by the light of the candle in  his hand,--he acceded to the request for accommodations. The traveler  was shown into an extremely neat parlor, where a fire had been lighted  to cheer the dullness of an easterly storm and an October evening. After  giving the valise into the keeping of his civil attendant, and politely  repeating his request to the old gentleman, who arose to receive him,  and paying his compliments to the three ladies who were seated at work  with their needles, the stranger commenced laying aside some of the  outer garments which he had worn in his ride.    On taking an extra handkerchief from his neck, and removing a cloak of  blue cloth, with a surtout of the same material, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9882"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 262, July (#3)"],[1,"is closely allied with envy, and  Robespierre was one of the most envious and vindictive men that ever  lived. He never was known to pardon any opposition, affront, or even  rivalry; and to be marked in his tablets on such an account was a sure,  though perhaps not an immediate, sentence of death. Danton was a hero,  compared with this cold, calculating, creeping miscreant; for his  passions, though exaggerated, had at least some touch of humanity, and  his brutal ferocity was supported by brutal courage.--(_Continued at  page 17. [Note: See Mirror 263.])           *       *       *       *       *      THE EPICUREAN.    _By T. Moore, Esq._      The following is described by Alciphron, the hero of the tale, at the  termination of a festival, in a tone which strongly reminds us of  Rasselas:--    \"The sounds of the song and dance had ceased, and I was now left in  those luxurious gardens alone. Though so ardent and active a votary of  pleasure, I had, by nature, a disposition full of melancholy;--an  imagination that presented sad thoughts even in the midst of mirth and  happiness, and threw the shadow of the future over the gayest illusions  of the present. Melancholy was, indeed, twin-born in my soul with  passion; and, not even in the fullest fervour of the latter were they  separated. From the first moment that I was conscious of thought and  feeling, the same dark thread had run across the web; and images of  death and annihilation mingled themselves with the most smiling scenes  through which my career of enjoyment led me. My very passion for  pleasure but deepened these gloomy fancies. For, shut out, as I was by  my creed, from a future life, and having no hope beyond the narrow  horizon of this, every minute of delight assumed a mournful preciousness  in my eyes, and pleasure, like the flower of the cemetery, grew but more  luxuriant from the neighbourhood of death. This very night my triumph,  my happiness, had seemed complete. I had been the presiding genius of  that voluptuous scene. Both my ambition and my love of pleasure had  drunk deep of the cup for which they thirsted. Looked up to by the  learned, and loved by the beautiful and the young, I had seen, in every  eye that met mine, either the acknowledgment of triumphs already won, or  the promise of others, still brighter, that awaited me. Yet, even in the  midst of all this, the same dark thoughts had presented themselves; the  perishableness of myself and all around me every instant recurred to my  mind. Those hands I had prest--those eyes, in which I had seen sparkling  a spirit of light and life that should never die--those voices that had  talked of eternal love--all, all, I felt, were but a mockery of the  moment, and would leave nothing eternal but the silence of their dust!        \"Oh, were it not for this sad voice,        Stealing amid our mirth to say,      That all in which we most rejoice,        Ere night may be the earth-worm's prey:      _But_ for this bitter--only this--      Full as the world is brimm'd with bliss,      And capable as feels my soul      Of draining to its depth the whole,      I should turn earth to heaven, and be,      If bliss made gods, a deity!\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.      I had already seen some of the most celebrated works of nature in  different parts of the globe; I had seen Etna and Vesuvius; I had seen  the Andes almost at their greatest elevation; Cape Horn, rugged and  bleak, buffeted by the southern tempest; and, though last not least, I  had seen the long swell of the Pacific; but nothing I had ever beheld or  imagined could compare in grandeur with the Falls of Niagara. My first  sensation was that of exquisite delight at having before me the greatest  wonder of the world. Strange as it may appear, this feeling was  immediately succeeded by an irresistible melancholy. Had this not  continued, it might perhaps have been attributed to the satiety incident  to the complete gratification of \"hope long deferred;\" but so far from  diminishing, the more I gazed, the stronger and deeper the sentiment  became. Yet this scene of sadness was strangely mingled with a kind of  intoxicating fascination. Whether the phenomenon is peculiar to Niagara  I know not, but certain it is, that the spirits are affected and  depressed in a singular manner by the magic influence of this stupendous  and eternal fall. About five miles above the cataract the river expands  to the dimensions of a lake, after which it gradually narrows. The  Rapids commence at the upper extremity of Goat Island, which is half a  mile in length, and divides the river at the point of precipitation into  two unequal parts; the largest is distinguished by the several names of  the Horseshoe, Crescent, and British Fall, from its semi-circular form  and contiguity to the Canadian shore. The smaller is named the American  Fall. A portion of this fall is divided by a rock from Goat Island, and  though here insignificant in appearance, would rank high among  European cascades....    The current runs about six miles an hour; but supposing it to be only  five miles, the quantity which passes the falls in an hour is more than  eighty-five millions of tuns avoirdupois; if we suppose it to be six, it  will be more than one hundred and two millions; and in a day would  exceed two thousand four hundred millions of tuns....    The next morning, with renewed delight, I beheld from my window--I may  say, indeed, from my bed--the stupendous vision. The beams of the rising  sun shed over it a variety of tints; a cloud of spray was ascending from  the crescent; and as I viewed it from above, it appeared like the steam  rising from the boiler of some monstrous engine....    This evening I went down with one of our party to view the cataract by  moonlight. I took my favourite seat on the projecting rock, at a little  distance from the brink of the fall, and gazed till every sense seemed  absorbed in contemplation. Although the shades of night increased the  sublimity of the prospect and \"deepened the murmur of the falling  floods,\" the moon in placid beauty shed her soft influence upon the  mind, and mitigated the horrors of the scene. The thunders which  bellowed from the abyss, and the loveliness of the falling element,  which glittered like molten silver in the moonlight, seemed to complete  in absolute perfection the rare union of the beautiful with the  sublime....    While reflecting upon the inadequacy of language to express the feelings  I experienced, or to describe the wonders which I surveyed, an American  gentleman, to my great amusement, tapped me on the shoulder, and  \"guessed\" that it was \"_pretty droll!_\" It was difficult to avoid  laughing in his face; yet I could not help envying him his vocabulary,  which had so eloquently released me from my dilemma....    Though earnestly dissuaded from the undertaking, I had determined to  employ the first fine morning in visiting the cavern beneath the fall.  The guide recommended my companion and myself to set out as early as six  o'clock, that we might have the advantage of the morning sun upon the  waters. We came to the guide's house at the appointed hour, and  disencumbered ourselves of such garments as we did not wish to have  wetted; descending the circular ladder, we followed the course of the  path running along the top of the _debris_ of the precipice, which I  have already described. Having pursued this track for about eighty  yards, in the course of which we were completely drenched, we found  ourselves close to the cataract. Although enveloped in a cloud of spray,  we could distinguish without difficulty the direction of our path, and  the nature of the cavern we were about to enter. Our guide warned us of  the difficulty in respiration which we should encounter from the spray,  and recommended us to look with exclusive attention to the security of  our footing. Thus warned, we pushed forward, blown about and buffeted by  the wind, stunned by the noise, and blinded by the spray. Each  successive gust penetrated us to the very bones with cold. Determined to  proceed, we toiled and struggled on, and having followed the footsteps  of the guide as far as was possible consistently with safety, we sat  down, and having collected our senses by degrees, the wonders of the  cavern slowly developed themselves. It is impossible to describe the  strange unnatural light reflected through its crystal wall, the roar of  the waters, and the blasts of the hurried hurricane which perpetually  rages in its recesses. We endured its fury a sufficient time to form a  notion of the shape and dimensions of this dreadful place. The cavern  was tolerably light, though the sun was unfortunately enveloped in  clouds. His disc was invisible, but we could clearly distinguish his  situation through the watery barrier. The fall of the cataract is nearly  perpendicular. The bank over which it is precipitated is of concave  form, owing to its upper stratum being composed of lime-stone, and its  base of soft slate-stone, which has been eaten away by the constant  attrition of the recoiling waters. The cavern is about one hundred and  twenty feet in height, fifty in breadth, and three hundred in length.  The entrance was completely invisible. By screaming in our ears, the  guide contrived to explain to us that there was one more point which we  might have reached had the wind been in any other direction. Unluckily  it blew full upon the sheet of the cataract, and drove it in so as to  dash upon the rock over which we must have passed. A few yards beyond  this, the precipice becomes perpendicular, and, blending with the water,  forms the extremity of the cave. After a stay of nearly ten minutes in  this most horrible purgatory, we gladly left it to its loathsome  inhabitants the eel and the water-snake, who crawl about its recesses in  considerable numbers,--and returned to the"]]]
