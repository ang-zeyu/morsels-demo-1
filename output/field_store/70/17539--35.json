[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#3)"],[1,"the mental and social relationship that existed between us.  Some time during this association (I cannot recall the exact night now)  I had a strange dream, in which my chum appeared to me with outstretched hand,  asking me to shake, saying, `I shall not see you any more.'  With that,  the dream lapsed and was over.  I thought nothing of the occurrence, and had  almost forgotten it, when one day, about a week later, during which time I had  not had a glimpse of my chum, while he was out hunting with another friend,  W. McC., in following him over a rail fence, the latter's gun was accidentally  discharged in Willie's face and neck, resulting in instant death.  With this shocking news the memory of the dream I had had came back to me  vividly and puzzled me very greatly, and indeed has puzzled me to this day.''  Signed ``G.''    The recipients of the above dreams are living to-day and their names  and address may be obtained, none of them are credulous fanatics  or predisposed to a belief in psychic or spirit phenomena.    The above dreams, except two, cannot be explained by telepathy,  because the mental picture cast on the dream mind had not in either  instance taken place in waking life.  This would account for  the dream perception of ``D,'' which did not, in all probability,  take place until after the murder had been committed.    The vision of ``F'' might be disposed of in the same way.  In this instance ``F'' saw the white-robed specter open the door,  walk around the room and finally, taking his position as if  to depart, say:  ``I have taken all you have.''  No doubt this  vision took place at the exact moment of the child's death.    There are thousands of similar experiences occurring daily in the lives  of honest, healthy and sane human beings, that rival the psychic  manifestations of Indian Yogism or Hebrew records.    Still men go on doubting this true and loving subjective intelligence  that is constantly wooing for entrance into the soul and is ever  vigilant in warning the material life of approaching evils.  They prefer the Witch of Endor, and the Black Magicians of ancient  Egypt to the higher, or Christ self, that has been seen and heard  by the sages and saints of all ages, assuming appropriate symbols,  as in the case of the vision of ``F,'' where the angel of  death was assumed.    To Paul it appeared as a great personal truth whom he was  relentlessly persecuting.  To many a wayward son or daughter  of the present time, it appears as a dead relative or friend,  in order to approach the material mind and make its  warning more effective.    To those who were interested in the teachings of Christ, but who after  his death were inclined to doubt him, this higher self materialized  in the form of the Great Master in order to impress on their material  minds the spiritual import of his teachings.  So, to this day, when doubt  and temptation mar the moral instinct, God, through the spiritual self,  as Job says, approaches man while in deep sleep upon the bed to impress  his instructions that he may change man from his purpose.    The spiritual world always fixes its orbit upon a  straight line, while the material world is fonder of curves.  We find man struggling through dreadful marshes and deserts  of charlatanism in order to get a glimpse into his future,  instead of solicitously following the straight line of inner  consciousness that connects with the infinite mind, from which,  aided by his Church and the healthy action of his own judgment,  he may receive those helpful spiritual impressions and messages  necessary to solace the longings of the searching soul.    The philosophy of the True Master is the straight line.  Pythagoras, Plato and Christ created angles by running vertical lines  through the ecclesiastical and hypocritical conventionalities of their day.  The new angles and curves thus produced by the bold philosophy  of the humble Nazarene have confronted with impregnable firmness  during the intervening ages the sophistry of the Pharisees.    ``In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,  in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth  their instruction.  That he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide  pride from man.''--JOB 33:15.    ``Man cannot contradict the laws of Nature.  But, are all the laws  of Nature yet understood?''    ``Real philosophy seeks rather to solve than to deny.''--LYTTON.    Those who live active lives exclude spiritual thought and  fill their minds with the fascinations of worldly affairs,  pleasure and business, dream with less frequency than  those who regard objective matters with lighter concern.  The former depend alone upon the voluptuous warmth of the world  for contentment; they look to money, the presence of some one,  or to other external sources for happiness, and are often disappointed;  while the latter, with a just appreciation of temporal wants,  depend alone upon the inner consciousness for that peace  which passeth all carnal understanding.    They are strengthened, as were Buddha and Christ, by suppressing  the sensual fires for forty days and nights in the wilderness of trial  and temptation.  They number a few, and are never disappointed,  while the former number millions.    Nature is three-fold, so is man; male and female, son or soul.  The union of one and two produce the triad or the trinity  which underlies the philosophy of the ancients.    Man has a physical or visible body, an atom of the physical or visible earth.  He has a soul the exact counterpart of his body, but invisible and subjective;  incomplete and imperfect as the external man, or _vice versa_.    The soul is not only the son or creation of man, but it is the real man.  It is the inner imperishable double or imprint of what has outwardly  and inwardly transpired.  All thoughts, desires and actions enter the soul  through the objective mind.    The automaton of the body responds as quickly to the bat  of the eye as it does to the movement of the whole body.  By it the foot-steps of man and the very hairs of his head are numbered.  Thus it becomes his invisible counterpart.  It is therefore the book  of life or death, and by it he judges himself or is already judged.  When it is complete nothing can be added or taken from its personnel.  It is sometimes partly opened to him in his dreams, but in death  is clearly revealed.    Man has also a spiritual body, subjective to, and more ethereal  than the soul.  It is an infinitesimal atom, and is related  in substance to the spiritual or infinite mind of the universe.  Just as the great physical sun, the center of visible light,  life and heat, is striving to purify the foul miasma of the marsh  and send its luminous messages of love into the dark crevices  of the earth, so the Great Spiritual Sun, of which the former  is a visible prototype or reflection, is striving to illuminate  with Divine Wisdom the personal soul and mind of man, thus enabling  him to become cognizant of the spiritual or Christ presence within.    The heresy and Herod of wanton flesh, degenerate victim of  the sensuous filth and fermentation of self-indulgence, is ever  striving to exile and suppress, from the wilderness of sin,  the warning cry of the Nazarite voice by intriguing with the cunning,  incestuous daughters of unholy thoughts and desires.    The objective mind is most active when the body is awake.  The subjective influences are most active, and often fill  the mind with impressions, while the physical body is asleep.  The spiritual intelligence can only intrude itself when  the human will is suspended, or passive to external states.  A man who lives only on the sensual plane will receive his  knowledge through the senses, and will not, while in that state,  receive spiritual impressions or warning dreams.    Men and women rarely ever degrade themselves so low that  the small voice of the desert does not bring them a message.  Sodom and Gomorrah, vile with the debauchery of a nameless crime,  were not deserted by the angel of love until the fire  which they had lighted in their souls had consumed them.  The walls of Jericho did not fall until Rahab, the harlot,  had been saved and the inmates had heard for several days  the ram's-horn and the tramp of Joshua's infantry.    The evangelist Jonah, the Sam Jones of Hebrew theology,  exhorted the adulterous Nineveh many times to repentance  before it fell.    David, while intoxicated with the wine of love, from languishing  in the seductive embrace of the beautiful bathing nymph, Bathsheba,  heard the voice of Nathan.  Surely God is no respecter of persons,  and will speak to all classes if the people will not stiffen their  necks or harden their hearts.    Women dream more often and more vividly than men, because their dream  composition is less influenced and allied to external environments.    All dreams possess an element of warning or prescience;  some more than others.  This is unknown to the many, but is known  to the observing few.  There are many people who have no natural  taste for music, and who do not know one note from another.  There are also those who cannot distinguish one color from another.  To the former there is no harmony of sound, and to the latter  there is no blending of colors.    They are heard and seen, but there is no artistic recognition of the same.  Still it would be absurd to say to either the musician or the artist:  your art is false and is only an illusion of the senses.    One man apparently never dreams; another dreams occasionally,  and still another more frequently; none atttempt{sic} to interpret  their dream, or to observe what follows; therefore, the verdict is,  ``There is nothing in dreams.''  (Schopenhauer aptly says:  ``No man can see over his own height.... Intellect is invisible  to the man who has none.'') The first is like the blind man who  denies the existence of light,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1,"s.    One night, as he was eating supper at an inn, four men came in and sat  down at the table with him. By his magical power, Hugh knew that they  were robbers and meant to kill him that night, in order to get his  money.    So, to divert their attention, Hugh made something like a horn to grow  up out of the table, and then laid a spell on the robbers, so that  they were kept gazing at the curious thing all night long, while he  went to bed and slept soundly.    When he rose in the morning, he paid his bill and went away, while the  robbers were still gazing at the horn. Only when the officers arrived  to take them to prison did they come to themselves.    Now at Bettws-y-Coed-that pretty place which has a name that sounds so  funny to us Americans and suggests a girl named Betty the Co-ed at  college--there was a hotel, named the \"Inn of Three Kegs.\" The shop  sign hung out in front. It was a bunch of grapes gilded and set below  three small barrels.    This inn was kept by two respectable ladies, who were sisters.    Yet in that very hotel, several travelers, while they were asleep, had  been robbed of their money. They could not blame anyone nor tell how  the mischief was done. With the key in the keyhole, they had kept  their doors locked during the night. They were sure that no one had  entered the room. There were no signs of men's boots, or of anyone's  footsteps in the garden, while nothing was visible on the lock or  door, to show that either had been tampered with. Everything was in  order as when they went to bed.    Some people doubted their stories, but when they applied to Hugh the  conjurer, he believed them and volunteered to solve the mystery. His  motto was \"Go anywhere and everywhere, but catch the thief.\"    When Hugh applied one night for lodging at the inn, nothing could be  more agreeable than the welcome, and fine manners of his two  hostesses.    At supper time, and during the evening, they all chatted together  merrily. Hugh, who was never at a loss for news or stories, told about  the various kinds of people and the many countries he had visited, in  imagination, just as if he had seen them all, though he had never set  foot outside of Wales.    When he was ready to go to bed, he said to the ladies:    \"It is my custom to keep a light burning in my room, all night, but I  will not ask for candles, for I have enough to last me until sunrise.\"  So saying, he bade them good night.    Entering his room and locking the door, he undressed, but laid his  clothes near at hand. He drew his trusty sword out of its sheath and  laid it upon the bed beside him, where he could quickly grasp it. Then  he pretended to be asleep and even snored.    It was not long before, peeping between his eyelids, only half closed,  he saw two cats come stealthily down the chimney.    When in the room, the animals frisked about, and then gamboled and  romped in the most lively way. Then they chased each other around the  bed, as if they were trying to find out whether Hugh was asleep.    Meanwhile, the supposed sleeper kept perfectly motionless. Soon the  two cats came over to his clothes and one of them put her paw into the  pocket that contained his purse.    At this, with one sweep of his sword, Hugh struck at the cat's paw.  The beast howled frightfully, and both animals ran for the chimney and  disappeared. After that, everything was quiet until breakfast time.    At the table, only one of the sisters was present. Hugh politely  inquired after the other one. He was told that she was not well, for  which Hugh said he was very sorry.    After the meal, Hugh declared he must say good-by to both the sisters,  whose company he had so enjoyed the night before. In spite of the  other lady's many excuses, he was admitted to the sick lady's room.    After polite greetings and mutual compliments, Hugh offered his hand  to say \"good-by.\" The sick lady smiled at once and put out her hand,  but it was her left one.    \"Oh, no,\" said Hugh, with a laugh. \"I never in all my life have taken  any one's left hand, and, beautiful as yours is, I won't break my  habit by beginning now and here.\"    Reluctantly, and as if in pain, the sick lady put out her hand. It was  bandaged.    The mystery was now cleared up. The two sisters were cats.    By the help of bad fairies they had changed their forms and were the  real robbers.    Hugh seized the hand of the other sister and made a little cut in it,  from which a few drops of blood flowed, but the spell was over.    \"Henceforth,\" said Hugh, \"you are both harmless, and I trust you will  both be honest women.\"    And they were. From that day they were like other women, and kept one  of the best of those inns--clean, tidy, comfortable and at modest  prices--for which Wales is, or was, noted.    Neither as cats with paws, nor landladies, with soaring bills, did  they ever rob travelers again.          IV      HOW THE CYMRY LAND BECAME INHABITED      In all Britain to-day, no wolf roams wild and the deer are all tame.    Yet in the early ages, when human beings had not yet come into the  land, the swamps and forests were full of very savage animals. There  were bears and wolves by the thousand besides lions and the woolly  rhinoceros, tigers, with terrible teeth like sabres.    Beavers built their dams over the little rivers, and the great horned  oxen were very common. Then the mountains were higher, and the woods  denser. Many of the animals lived in caves, and there were billions of  bees and a great many butterflies. In the bogs were ferns of giant  size, amid which terrible monsters hid that were always ready for a  fight or a frolic.    In so beautiful a land, it seemed a pity that there were no men and  women, no boys or girls, and no babies.    Yet the noble race of the Cymry, whom we call the Welsh, were already  in Europe and lived in the summer land in the South. A great  benefactor was born among them, who grew up to be a wonderfully wise  man and taught his people the use of bows and arrows. He made laws, by  which the different tribes stopped their continual fighting and  quarrels, and united for the common good of all. He persuaded them to  take family names. He invented the plow, and showed them how to use  it, making furrows, in which to plant grain.    When the people found that they could get things to eat right out of  the ground, from the seed they had planted, their children were wild  with joy.    No people ever loved babies more than these Cymry folk and it was they  who invented the cradle. This saved the hard-working mothers many a  burden, for each woman had, besides rearing the children, to work for  and wait on her husband.    He was the warrior and hunter, and she did most of the labor, in both  the house and the field. When there were many little brats to look  after, a cradle was a real help to her. In those days, \"brat\" was the  general name for little folks. There were good laws, about women  especially for their protection. Any rough or brutish fellow was fined  heavily, or publicly punished, for striking one of them.    By and by, this great benefactor encouraged his people to the brave  adventure, and led them, in crossing the sea to Britain. Men had not  yet learned to build boats, with prow or stern, with keels and masts,  or with sails, rudders, or oars, or much less to put engines in their  bowels, or iron chimneys for smoke stacks, by which we see the mighty  ships driven across the ocean without regard to wind or tide.    This great benefactor taught his people to make coracles, and on these  the whole tribe of thousands of Cymric folk crossed over into Britain,  landing in Cornwall. The old name of this shire meant the Horn of  Gallia, or Wallia, as the new land was later named. We think of  Cornwall as the big toe of the Mother Land. These first comers called  it a horn.    It was a funny sight to see these coracles, which they named after  their own round bodies. The men went down to the riverside or the sea  shore, and with their stone hatchets, they chopped down trees. They  cut the reeds and osiers, peeled the willow branches, and wove great  baskets shaped like bowls. In this work, the women helped the men.    The coracle was made strong by a wooden frame fixed inside round the  edge, and by two cross boards, which also served as seats. Then they  turned the wicker frame upside down and stretched the hides of animals  over the whole frame and bottom. With pitch, gum, or grease, they  covered up the cracks or seams. Then they shaped paddles out of wood.  When the coracle floated on the water, the whole family, daddy, mammy,  kiddies, and any old aunts or uncles, or granddaddies, got into it.  They waited for the wind to blow from the south over to the northern  land.    At first the coracle spun round and round, but by and by each daddy  could, by rowing or paddling, make the thing go straight ahead. So  finally all arrived in the land now called Great Britain.    Though sugar was not then known, or for a thousand years later, the  first thing they noticed was the enormous number of bees. When they  searched, they found the rock caves and hollow trees full of honey,  which had accumulated for generations. Every once in a while the  bears, that so like sweet things, found out the hiding place of the  bees, and ate up the honey. The children were very happy in sucking  the honey comb and the mothers made candles out of the beeswax. The  new comers named the country Honey Island.    The brave Cymry men had battles with the darker skinned people who  were already there. When any one, young or old, died, their friends  and relatives sat up all night guarding the body against wild beasts  or savage men. This grew to be a settled custom and such a meeting was  called a \"wake.\" Everyone present did keep awake, and often in a very  lively way.    As the Cymry multiplied, they built many _don_, or towns. All  over the land to-day are names"]]]
