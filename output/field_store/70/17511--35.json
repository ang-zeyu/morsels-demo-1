This may be very clever too.    \"But the gods play with a strange scheme.    \"I will send jests into the world and a little mirth. And while  Death seems to thee as far away as the purple rim of hills; or  sorrow as far off as rain in the blue days of summer, then pray to  Limpang-Tung. But when thou growest old, or ere thou diest, pray  not of Limpang-Tung, for thou becomest part of a scheme that he  doth not understand.    \"Go out into the starry night, and Limpang-Tung will dance with  thee who danced since the gods were young, the god of mirth and of  melodious minstrels. Or offer up a jest to Limpang-Tung; only pray  not in thy sorrow to Limpang-Tung, for he saith of sorrow: 'It may  be very clever of the gods,' but he doth not understand.\"    And Limpang-Tung said: \"I am lesser than the gods; pray,  therefore, to the small gods and not to Limpang-Tung.    \"Natheless between Pegana and the Earth flutter ten thousand  thousand prayers that beat their wings against the face of Death,  and never for one of them hath the hand of the Striker been  stayed, nor yet have tarried the feet of the Relentless One.    \"Utter thy prayer! It may accomplish where failed ten thousand  thousand.    \"Limpang-Tung is lesser than the gods, and doth not understand.\"    And Limpang-Tung said: \"Lest men grow weary down on the great  Worlds through gazing always at a changeless sky, I will paint my  pictures in the sky. And I will paint them twice in every day for  so long as days shall be. Once as the day ariseth out of the homes  of dawn will I paint the Blue, that men may see and rejoice; and  ere day falleth under into the night will I paint upon the Blue  again, lest men be sad.    \"It is a little,\" said Limpang-Tung, \"it is a little even for a  god to give some pleasure to men upon the Worlds.\"    And Limpang-Tung hath sworn that the pictures that he paints shall  never be the same for so long as the days shall be, and this he  hath sworn by the oath of the gods of Pegana that the gods may  never break, laying his hand upon the shoulder of each of the gods  and swearing by the light behind Their eyes.    Limpang-Tung hath lured a melody out of the stream and stolen its  anthem from the forest; for him the wind hath cried in lonely places  and the ocean sung its dirges. There is music for Limpang-Tung in  the sounds of the moving of grass and in the voices of the people  that lament or in the cry of them that rejoice.    In an inner mountain land where none hath come he hath carved his  organ pipes out of the mountains, and there when the winds, his  servants, come in from all the world he maketh the melody of  Limpang-Tung. But the song, arising at night, goeth forth like a  river, winding through all the world, and here and there amid the  peoples of earth one heareth, and straightaway all that hath voice  to sing crieth aloud in music to his soul.    Or sometimes walking through the dusk with steps unheard by men,  in a form unseen by the people, Limpang-Tung goeth abroad, and,  standing behind the minstrels in cities of song, waveth his hands  above them to and fro, and the minstrels bend to their work, and  the voice of the music ariseth; and mirth and melody abound in  that city of song, and no one seeth Limpang-Tung as he standeth  behind the minstrels.    But through the mists towards morning, in the dark when the  minstrels sleep and mirth and melody have sunk to rest, Limpang-Tung  goeth back again to his mountain land.        OF YOHARNETH-LAHAI    (The God of Little Dreams and Fancies)      Yaoharneth-Lahai is the god of little dreams and fancies.    All night he sendeth little dreams out of Pegana to please the  people of Earth.    He sendeth little dreams to the poor man and to The King.    He is so busy to send his dreams to all before the night be ended  that oft he forgetteth which be the poor man and which be The  King.    To whom Yoharneth-Lahai cometh not with little dreams and sleep he  must endure all night the laughter of the gods, with highest  mockery, in Pegana.    All night long Yoharneth-Lahai giveth peace to cities until the  dawn hour and the departing of Yoharneth-Lahai, when it is time  for the gods to play with men again.    Whether the dreams and the fancies of Yoharneth-Lahai be false and  the Things that are done in the Day be real, or the Things that  are done in the Day be false and the dreams and the fancies of  Yoharneth-Lahai be true, none knoweth saving only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI,  who hath not spoken.        OF ROON, THE GOD OF GOING, AND THE THOUSAND HOME GODS      Roon said: \"There be gods of moving and gods of standing still,  but I am the god of Going.\"    It is because of Roon that the worlds are never still, for the  moons and the worlds and the comet are stirred by the spirit of  Roon, which saith: \"Go! Go! Go!\"    Roon met the Worlds all in the morning of Things, before there was  light upon Pegana, and Roon danced before them in the Void, since  when they are never still, Roon sendeth all streams to the Sea,  and all the rivers to the soul of Slid.    Roon maketh the sign of Roon before the waters, and lo! they have  left the hills; and Roon hath spoken in the ear of the North Wind  that he may be still no more.    The footfall of Roon hath been heard at evening outside the houses  of men, and thenceforth comfort and abiding know them no more.  Before them stretcheth travel over all the lands, long miles, and  never resting between their homes and their graves--and all at the  bidding of Roon.    The Mountains have set no limit against Roon nor all the seas a  boundary.    Whither Roon hath desired there must Roon's people go, and the  worlds and their streams and the winds.    I heard the whisper of Roon at evening, saying: \"There are islands  of spices to the South,\" and the voice of Roon saying: \"Go.\"    And Roon said: \"There are a thousand home gods, the little gods  that sit before the hearth and mind the fire--there is one Roon.\"    Roon saith in a whisper, in a whisper when none heareth, when the  sun is low: \"What doeth MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI?\" Roon is no god that  thou mayest worship by thy hearth, nor will he be benignant to thy  home.    Offer to Roon thy toiling and thy speed, whose incense is the  smoke of the camp fire to the South, whose song is the sound of  going, whose temples stand beyond the farthest hills in his lands  behind the East.    Yarinareth, Yarinareth, Yarinareth, which signifieth Beyond--these  words be carved in letters of gold upon the arch of the great portal  of the Temple of Roon that men have builded looking towards the East  upon the Sea, where Roon is carved as a giant trumpeter, with his  trumpet pointing towards the East beyond the Seas.    Whoso heareth his voice, the voice of Roon at evening, he at once  forsaketh the home gods that sit beside the hearth. These be the  gods of the hearth: Pitsu, who stroketh the cat; Hobith who calms  the dog; and Habaniah, the lord of glowing embers; and little  Zumbiboo, the lord of dust; and old Gribaun, who sits in the heart  of the fire to turn the wood to ash--all these be home gods, and  live not in Pegana and be lesser than Roon.    There is also Kilooloogung, the lord of arising smoke, who taketh  the smoke from the hearth and sendeth it to the sky, who is  pleased if it reacheth Pegana, so that the gods of Pegana,  speaking to the gods, say: \"There is Kilooloogung doing the work  on earth of Kilooloogung.\"    All these are gods so small that they be lesser than men, but  pleasant gods to have beside the hearth; and often men have prayed  to Kilooloogung, saying: \"Thou whose smoke ascendeth to Pegana  send up with it our prayers, that the gods may hear.\" And  Kilooloogung, who is pleased that men should pray, stretches  himself up all grey and lean, with his arms above his head, and  sendeth his servant the smoke to seek Pegana, that the gods of  Pegana may know that the people pray.    And Jabim is the Lord of broken things, who sitteth behind the  house to lament the things that are cast away. And there he  sitteth lamenting the broken things until the worlds be ended, or  until someone cometh to mend the broken things. Or sometimes he  sitteth by the river's edge to lament the forgotten things that  drift upon it.    A kindly god is Jabim, whose heart is sore if anything be lost.    There is also Triboogie, the Lord of Dusk, whose children are the  shadows, who sitteth in a corner far off from Habaniah and  speaketh to none. But after Habaniah hath gone to sleep and old  Gribaun hath blinked a hundred times, until he forgetteth which be  wood or ash, then doth Triboogie send his children to run about  the room and dance upon the walls, but never disturb the silence.    But when there is light again upon the worlds, and dawn comes  dancing down the highway from Pegana, then does Triboogie retire  into his corner, with his children all around him, as though they  had never danced about the room. And the slaves of Habaniah and  old Gribaun come and awake them from their sleep upon the hearth,  and Pitsu strokes the cat, and Hobith calms the dog, and  Kilooloogung stretches aloft his arms towards Pegana, and  Triboogie is very still, and his children asleep.    And when it is dark, all in the hour of Triboogie, Hish creepeth  from the forest, the Lord of Silence, whose children are the bats,  that have broken the command of their father, but in a voice that  is ever so low. Hish husheth the mouse and all the whispers in the  night; he maketh all noises still. Only the cricket rebelleth. But  Hish hath set against him such a spell that after he hath cried a  thousand times his voice may be heard no more but becometh part of  the silence.    And when he hath slain all sounds Hish boweth low to the ground;  then cometh into the house, with never a sound of feet, the god  Yoharneth-Lahai.    But away in the forest whence Hish hath come Wohoon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#3)"],[1,"by one man, Sultan  Kin, who had a deputy called Wurrah, renowned alike for his ferocity  of character and his ability to govern.    For some years Darud and his Arab followers led a quiet, peaceable  life, gaining the confidence of his host, and inspiring Kin's subjects  with reverence for their superior talents. In process of time, by  intermarriage and proselytising, these Mussulmans increased in number,  and gained such strength, that they began to covet, and finally  determined to take the country from the race that had preceded them.  This project, by various intrigues and machinations, was easily  effected; and Kin, with all his Christians, was driven back to his  native highlands in Ethiopia.[5] Darud now was paramount in all this  land, and reigned until he died, when an only son by his Asyri wife  succeeded to him. This man's name was Kabl Ullah, who had a son called  Harti. On succeeding his father, Harti had three sons, called  respectively, in order of birth, Warsingali, Dulbahanta, and  Mijjertaine. Amongst these three he divided his kingdom, which to this  day retains the names. The Mijjertaine dispersed over the eastern  portions of the land, the Warsingali held the central, and the  Dulbahantas the western territories.[6]    Subsequently to this period, an Arab called Ishak came across from  Southern Arabia and established himself forcibly at Méit, and founded  the three different nations who now occupy all the coast-line from Ras  Galwéni on the eastward to Zeyleh on the extreme west of the Somali  country. Ishak, it appears, had three wives, who gave in issue three  sons, and among these three men was divided the whole country which he  subdued.    Forming themselves into tribes, the senior or Habr Gerhajis, by  constant feuds and other causes, are much distributed about the  country, but mostly occupy the hilly grounds to the southward of the  coast-line; whilst the Habr Owel, or second in order of birth, possess  all the coast of Berbera between Zeyleh and Kurrum; and the third, or  Habr Teljala, hold all the rest thence eastwards to Héis.    The Somali have been chiefly known to us since the time of our taking  occupation of Aden, whither many of them resort with their wives and  families to carry on trade, or do the more menial services of  porterage and donkey-driving. They are at once easily recognised by  the overland traveller by their singular appearance and boisterous  manner, as well as by their cheating and lying propensities, for which  they are peculiarly notorious; indeed, success in fraud is more  agreeable to them than any other mode of gaining a livelihood, and the  narration of such acts is their greatest delight in conversation. They  excel as donkey-boys even the Egyptians. As may be concluded from  their history, they are a mixed Ham-Shemitic race, but differing  considerably from both in their general appearance, though retaining  certain characteristics of both these breeds. They are a tall, slender  people, light and agile as deer; slightly darker than, though much the  colour of Arabs, with thin lip, and noses rather Grecian when compared  with those of blacks, but with woolly heads like the true negroes.  Their natures are so boisterous and warlike, that at Aden it has been  found necessary to disarm them. When they first arrived there, it was  not an unusual sight to see the men of different tribes, on the  hillsides that form the face of the \"crater,\" fighting battles-royal  with their spears and shields; and even to this day, they, without  their arms, sometimes have hot contests, by pelting one another with  sticks and stones. There is scarcely a man of them who does not show  some scars of wounds received in these turmoils, some apparently so  deep that it is marvellous how they ever recovered from them.    Their costume is very simple. The men, who despise trousers, wear a  single sheet of long-cloth, eight cubits long, thrown over the  shoulder, much after the fashion of the Scotsman's plaid. Some shave  their head, leaving it bare; others wear the mane of a lion as a wig,  which is supposed by them to give the character of ferocity and  courage to the wearer, while those who affect the dandy allow their  hair to grow, and jauntily place some sticks in it resembling the  Chinaman's joss-sticks, which, when arranging their toilette, they use  as a comb, and all carry as weapons of defence a spear and shield, a  shillelagh, and a long two-edged knife. The women clothe more  extensively, though not much so. Fastening a cloth tightly round the  body immediately under their arms, they allow it to fall evenly down  to the ground, and effectually cover their legs. The married ones  encase their hair in a piece of blue cloth, gathering it up at the  back of the head in the fashion of English women of the present day;  this is a sign of wedlock. The virgins wear theirs loose, plaited in  small plaits of three, which, being parted in the centre, allows the  hair to fall evenly down all round the head like a well-arranged mop.  On approaching these fairs, they seductively give their heads a cant  backwards, with a half side-jerk, which parts the locks in front, and  discloses a pretty little smiling face, with teeth as white as pearls,  and lips as red as rubies. Pretty as they are when young, this beauty  fades at once after bearing children, and all their fair proportions  go with it. After that marked peculiarity of female negroes, they  swell about the waist, and have that large development behind, which,  in polite language, is called steatopyga. Although they are  Mussulmans, none wear the yashmac. Beads are not so much in request  here as in other parts of Africa, though some do wear necklaces of  them, with large rings of amber. This description, however, applies to  the Somali in his own land. When he comes over to Aden he takes shame  at his nakedness, dons the Arab's gown and trousers, and becomes the  merchant complete.[7]    In consequence of the poorness of their land, almost all the Somali  are wandering pastorals, which of itself is enough to account for  their turbulent natures. The system of government they maintain is  purely patriarchal, and is succeeded to by order of birth generally in  a regular and orderly manner, attributable, it would appear, to the  reverence they feel for preserving their purity of blood. The head of  each clan is called Gerad or Sultan, who would be powerless in himself  were he not supported by the united influence of all the royal family.  When any disturbances or great disputes arise, the sultan is  consulted, who collects his elders in parliament to debate the matter  over, and, through them, ascertain the people's feelings. Petty  disputes are settled by the elders without any further reference. In  most cases war arises from blood-feuds, when a member of one clan  kills the subject of another, and will not pay the recognised  valuation of the party injured, or allow himself to be given up to the  vengeance of the family who has sustained the loss. In such cases as  these, whole tribes voluntarily march out to revenge the deed by  forcibly taking as many cattle from the aggressor as the market  valuation may amount to.    Thus a war, once contracted, does not subside for years, as by  repeated deaths among the contending parties the balance of  blood-money never can be settled. Moreover, the inflicted punishment  seldom falls on the party immediately concerned; added to which, in  wars of tribes, everybody helps himself to his enemy's cattle in the  best way he can, and men formerly poor now suddenly become rich, which  gives a zest to the extension of the contest nothing else could  produce. Indeed, the poorer orders of Somali are only too glad to have  a good pretext for a fight, as a means of bettering their condition,  by adding a few more head of cattle to their stock. Were this not the  case, there would be no fighting whatever, as the sultan would be  powerless to raise an army against the inclination of the people. War  only ceases when both sides become exhausted, and withdraw as by  mutual consent. The great object in these encounters is to steal away  as many cattle as possible without risk of person, and such feats are  boasted of with rapture by those returning home with any prize. In the  administration of justice they consult the Mosaic law, as given in the  Koran, taking life for life, and kind for kind.    The northern Somali have no permanent villages in the interior of the  country, as the ground is not cultivated; but they scatter about,  constantly moving with their flocks and herds to any place within  their limited districts where water is to be found, and erect  temporary huts of sticks, covered with grass mats; or, when  favourable, they throw up loose stone walls like the dykes in  Scotland. But on the sea-coast, wherever there are harbours for  shipping, they build permanent villages on a very primitive scale.  These are composed of square mat walls, supported by sticks, and all  huddled together, and partitioned off for the accommodation of the  various families, near which there are usually one or more square  box-shaped stone buildings, the property of the chief of the place,  which are designated forts, though there is nothing in their artless  construction to deserve this name. They are all composed of blocks of  coralline, cemented together with mortar extracted from the same  material.    Like nearly all places within the tropics, beyond the equatorial rainy  zone, this country is visited by regular monsoons, or seasons in which  the winds prevail constantly in one direction; consequently vessels  can only come into the harbours of the northern coast when the sun is  in the south, or during five months of the year, from the 15th  November to the 15th April, to trade with the people; and then the  Somali bring the products of their country, such as sheep, cows, ghee,  mats"]]]
