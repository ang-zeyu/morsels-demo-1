This demonstrates the comparatively late date of  the final redaction of this chapter.  By the middle of the ninth  century it formed a part of the treatise _Abot_.  It was added to the  prayer-book to be read on the sixth Sabbath of the period between  Passover and the Festival of Weeks (_Shebuot_) (17).          (15) A _Baraita_ contains traditions and opinions of        authorities of the _Mishnah_ which are not embodied in the        _Mishnah_ or Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi.  See Mielziner,        _Introduction to the Talmud_, pp. 20-21, Strack, _Einleitung        in den Talmud_, p. 3, and the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, _s.v._  A        _gemara_ (Talmudical commentary) to the _Baraita de-Abot_ was        published from a MS. by Coronel in _Chamishah Kuntresin_        (Vienna, 1864).  This _baraita_ is found also in the        seventeenth chapter of _Tanna de-Be Eliyahu Sutta_, but with        different textual readings.  See Ginzberg, in the _Jewish        Encyclopedia_, II, pp. 516-517.          (16) Known thus because Rabbi Meir's name is found in the        first verse.          (17) See next section.  The sixth chapter is found in some        editions of the _Mishnah_.                 ABOT IN THE LITURGY (18)          (18) On the subject-matter of this section, see the citation        from the Sar Shalom Gaon, in the _Siddur_ of R. Amram, 30a;        _Midrash Shemual_, pp. 3-4; Zunz, _Die Ritus_, pp. 85-86;        Strack, _Die Spruche der Vater_, p. 5, and _Siddur_, ed. Baer,        p. 271, note.  Other portions of the _Mishnah_ and also of the        _Talmud_ that are included in the liturgy are, in the morning        service, _Zebachim_ V (_Siddur_, ed. Singer, p. 11); in the        evening service for the Sabbath, _Sabbat_, II (pp. 120-122),        and, from the _Talmud_, end of _Berachot_ (p. 122); in the        additional service for Sabbath and festivals, from the _Talmud        Keritot_, 6a, from the _Mishnah_, end of _Tamid_, and from the        _Talmud_, end of _Berachot_ (pp. 167-168).    As Taylor has said, \"Its simplicity and intrinsic excellence have  secured for _Abot_ a widespread and lasting popularity, and have led  to its being excerpted from the _Talmud_ and used liturgically in the  Synagogue, at certain seasons, from an early period\" (19).  Thus, the  _Abot_ is found not only in all editions of the _Mishnah_ and the  _Talmud_, but also in the prayer-books of the Ashkenazic rite (20).  The practice of reading a chapter from _Abot_, on Saturday, after the  afternoon prayer (_Minchah_), originated as early as Gaonic times  (seventh to eleventh centuries).  During the middle of the ninth  century, _Abot_ and its _Baraita_ were thus liturgically used.  In  Spanish communities it was recited in the morning of the Sabbath, and  not in the afternoon.  By the eleventh century, this custom was  universally a part of the synagogal service.          (19) Taylor, _loc. cit._          (20) German and Polish.      Originally, _Abot_ was probably read only from Passover to _Shebuot;_  and, since this period has generally six Sabbaths, and there are only  five chapters of _Abot_, the chapter _Kinyan Torah_ was appointed to  be read on the sixth Sabbath.  Later, the period of the year in which  _Abot_ was read varied in different communities.  In Germany, there  were _kehillot_ in which it was recited during the winter as well as  during the summer.  In some communities it was read from Passover to  the Feast of Tabernacles (_Sukkot_), in others from the Sabbath of  _Parashah Yitro_ (Ex. XVIII, 1-XX, 26) to the Sabbath of _Parashah  Masse'e_ (Num. XXXIII, 1-XXXVI, 13), that is, from the Sabbath on  which is read an account of the giving of the Law until the Sabbath  preceding the beginning of the reading of the \"repetition of the Law,\"  _i.e._, Deuteronomy.  In many orthodox congregations to-day this  practice is still adhered to, and _Abot_ is read on Sabbath afternoons  during the summer, or from the Sabbath after Passover to the Sabbath  before the New Year (_Rosh ha-Shanah_).    A number of reasons have been suggested for the custom of reading the  _Abot_ in the synagogue, the most likely being that it was introduced  to occupy the minds of worshippers during the long wait, on a summer's  day, between the afternoon and evening services.  Whatever the reason  for this custom may have been is immaterial and unimportant; but what  is of importance is that, by this excellent practice, a whole body of  moral dicta--each one summing up with remarkable conciseness a life's  experience and philosophy, each one breathing the spirit of piety,  saintliness, justice, and love for humanity--has sunk deeply into the  innermost heart and consciousness of the Jewish people, exerting such  an influence that the principles set forth in the _Abot_ have been  eternally wrought into the moral fibre of the descendants of the  Rabbis.  To the lips of the Jew, these maxims spring spontaneously; to  those who know them they are a safe and secure guide through life;  they are not only heard in the synagogue, but are quoted and applied  at home and abroad.  Such are the fruits of a benign custom, which  Israel will do well to prize and preserve.                 BIBLIOGRAPHY    Because of its great popularity, the _Pirke Abot_ has appeared in many  editions.  There is no _Gemara_ (Talmudic commentary) on the _Abot_,  which undoubtedly accounts for the numerous commentaries on it (21).  Because of the attractiveness of its contents, and since it forms a  part of the ritual, it has been translated many times into many  tongues (22), and a great deal has been written on it.  The following  bibliography will be helpful to the general reader and to the student  who wish to get a more detailed and intimate knowledge of the _Abot_  than can be imparted in this work.

He certainly  hesitated at no cruelty of the sort at times, but we can clearly enough  see reasons of policy in most at least of the cases, which may have made  the action seem to him necessary. Nearly all are instances either of  defensive action or of vengeance, but that he should systematically  ravage the country when events were carrying out his plan as rapidly as  could be expected, we have no reason to consider in accordance with  William's policy or temper. In the meantime, as the invading army was  slowly drawing near to London, opinion there had settled, for the time at  least, upon a line of policy. Surviving leaders who had been defeated in  the great battle, men high in rank who had been absent, some purposely  standing aloof while the issue was decided, had gathered in the city.  Edwin and Morcar, the great earls of north and middle England, heads of  the house that was the rival of Harold's, who seem to have been willing  to see him and his power destroyed, had now come in, having learned the  result of the battle. The two archbishops were there, and certain of the  bishops, though which they were we cannot surely tell. Other names we do  not know, unless it be that of Esegar, Harold's staller and portreeve of  London, the hero of a doubtful story of negotiations with the approaching  enemy. But other nobles and men of influence in the state were certainly  there, though their names are not recorded. Nor was a military force  lacking, even if the \"army\" of Edwin and Morcar was under independent and  not trustworthy command. It is clear that the tone of public opinion was  for further resistance, and the citizens were not afraid to go out to  attack the Conqueror on his first approach to their neighbourhood. But  from all our sources of information the fatal fact stands out plainly, of  divided counsels and lack of leadership. William of Malmesbury believed,  nearly two generations later, and we must agree with him, that if the  English could have put aside \"the discord of civil strife,\" and have  \"united in a common policy, they could have amended the ruin of the  fatherland.\" But there was too much self-seeking and a lack of  patriotism. Edwin and Morcar went about trying to persuade people that  one or the other of them should be made king. Some of the bishops appear  to have opposed the choice of any king. No dominating personality arose  to compel agreement and to give direction and power to the popular  impulse. England was conquered, not by the superior force and genius of  the Norman, but by the failure of her own men in a great crisis of her  history.    The need of haste seems an element in the situation, and under the  combined pressure of the rapid approach of the enemy and of the public  opinion of the city--citizens and shipmen are both mentioned--the leaders  of Church and State finally came to an agreement that Edgar atheling  should be made king. It was the only possible step except that of  immediate submission. Grandson of Edmund Ironside, the king who had  offered stubborn and most skilful resistance to an earlier foreign  invader, heir of a house that had been royal since the race had had a  history, all men could unite upon him, and upon him alone, if there must  be a king. But there was no other argument in his favour. Neither the  blood of his grandfather nor the school of adversity had made of him the  man to deal with such a situation. In later life he impressed people as a  well-mannered, agreeable, and frank man, but no one ever detected in him  the stuff of which heroes are made. He was never consecrated king, though  the act would have strengthened his position, and one wonders if the fact  is evidence that the leaders had yielded only to a popular pressure in  agreeing upon him against their own preference, or merely of the haste  and confusion of events. One act of sovereignty only is attributed to  him, the confirmation of Brand, who had been chosen by the monks Abbot  of Peterborough, in succession to Leofric, of the house of Edwin and  Morcar, who had been present at the battle of Hastings and had died  soon after. William interpreted this reference of the election to Edgar  for confirmation as an act of hostility to himself, and fined the new  abbot heavily, but to us the incident is of value as evidence of the  character of the movement, which tried to find a national king in this  last male of Cerdic's line.    From Canterbury the invading army advanced directly upon London, and took  up a position in its neighbourhood. From this station a body of five  hundred horsemen was sent forward to reconnoitre the approaches to the  city, and the second battle of the conquest followed, if we may call that  a battle which seems to have been merely one-sided. At any rate, the  citizens intended to offer battle, and crossed the river and advanced  against the enemy in regular formation, but the Norman knights made short  work of the burgher battalions, and drove them back into the city with  great slaughter. The suburb on the south bank of the Thames fell into the  hands of the enemy, who burned down at least a part of it. William  gained, however, no further success at this point. London was not yet  ready to submit, and the river seems to have been an impassable barrier.  To find a crossing the Norman march was continued up the river, the  country suffering as before from the foraging of the army. The desired  crossing was found at Wallingford, not far below Oxford and nearly fifty  miles above London. That he could have crossed the river nearer the city  than this, if he had wished, seems probable, and considerations of  strategy may very likely have governed William's movements. Particularly  might this be the case if he had learned that Edwin and Morcar, with  their army, had abandoned the new king and retired northward, as some of  the best of modern scholars have believed, though upon what is certainly  not the best of evidence. If this was so, a little more time would surely  convince the Londoners that submission was the best policy, and the best  position for William to occupy would be between the city and this army in  the north, a position which he could easily reach, as he did, from his  crossing at Wallingford. If the earls had not abandoned London, this was  still the best position, cutting them off from their own country and the  city from the region whence reinforcements must come if they came at all.  A long sweep about a hostile city was favourite strategy of William's.    From some point along this line of march between Dover and Wallingford,  William had detached a force to secure the submission of Winchester. This  city was of considerable importance, both because it was the old royal  residence and still the financial centre of the state, and because it  was the abode of Edith, the queen of Edward the Confessor, to whom it  had been assigned as part of her dower. The submission of the city seems  to have been immediate and entirely satisfactory to William, who confirmed  the widowed Lady of England in her rights and showed later some favour to  the monks of the new minster. William of Poitiers, the duke's chaplain,  who possibly accompanied the army on this march,[2] and wrote an account  of these events not long afterwards, tells us that at Wallingford Stigand,  Archbishop of Canterbury, came in and made submission to his master. There  is no reason to doubt this statement, though it has been called in  question. The best English chroniclers omit his name from the list of  those who submitted when London surrendered. The tide of success had been  flowing strongly one way since the Normans landed. The condition of things  in London afforded no real hope that this tide could be checked. A man of  Stigand's type could be depended upon to see that if William's success was  inevitable, an early submission would be better than a late one. If  Stigand went over to William at Wallingford, it is a clear commentary on  the helplessness of the party of resistance in London.    From Wallingford William continued his leisurely march, leaving a trail  of devastation behind him through Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and  Hertfordshire, where he turned south towards London. But the city was  now convinced of the impossibility of resistance and was ready to yield  to the inevitable. How near the enemy was allowed to approach before  the step of actual surrender was taken is not quite certain. The  generally accepted opinion, on the authority of English chroniclers, is  that the embassy from London went to meet William at Berkhampsted,  thirty miles away, but if we could accept the suggestion which has been  made that Little Berkhampsted was the place intended, the distance  would agree better with the express statement of the chaplain, William  of Poitiers, that the city was in sight from the place of conference.  It is hard to avoid accepting William's statement, for it is precisely  the kind of thing which the men of the duke's army--which had been so  long approaching the city and thinking of its capture--would be likely  to notice and remember. It also agrees better with the probabilities  of the case. Thirty miles was still a safe distance, especially in  those days, and would allow much time for further debate and for the  unexpected to happen. Wherever the act of submission occurred, it was  in form complete and final for the city and for the chief men of  England. Edgar came to offer his useless and imperfect crown; Aldred,  Archbishop of York, was there to complete the submission of the Church;  bishops of several sees were also present, and chief men of the state,  among whom Edwin and Morcar are mentioned by one of the chroniclers who  had earlier sent them home to the north. Possibly he is right in both  statements, and the earls"]]]
