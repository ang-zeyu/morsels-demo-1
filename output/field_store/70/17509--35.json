[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#3)"],[1,"of  which is denied by Gaston Paris in \"Journal des Savants\", 1902, pp. 297  f.), \"Erec and Enide\", \"Cliges\", \"Lancelot\", \"Yvain\", \"Perceval\". The  arguments for this chronology, based upon external as well as internal  criticism, may be found in the Introductions to Professor Foerster's  recent editions. When we speculate upon the development of Chretien's  moral ideas we are not on such sure ground. As we have seen, his  standards vary widely in the different romances. How much of this  variation is due to chance circumstance imposed by the nature of  his subject or by the taste of his public, and how much to changing  conviction it is easy to see, when we consider some contemporary  novelist, how dangerous it is to judge of moral convictions as reflected  in literary work. \"Lancelot\" must be the keystone of any theory  constructed concerning the moral evolution of Chretien. The following  supposition is tenable, if the chronology of Foerster is correct. After  the works of his youth, consisting of lyric poems and translations  embodying the ideals of Ovid and of the school of contemporary  troubadour poets, Chretien took up the Arthurinn material and started  upon a new course. \"Erec\" is the oldest Arthurinn romance to have  survived in any language, but it is almost certainly not the first to  have been written. It is a perfectly clean story: of love, estrangement,  and reconciliation in the persons of Erec and his charming sweetheart  Enide. The psychological analysis of Erec's motives in the rude testing  of Enide is worthy of attention, and is more subtle than anything  previous in French literature with which we are acquainted. The poem is  an episodical romance in the biography of an Arthurinn hero, with the  usual amount of space given to his adventures. \"Cliges\" apparently  connects a Byzantine tale of doubtful origin in an arbitrary fashion  with the court of Arthur. It is thought that the story embodies the same  motive as the widespread tale of the deception practised upon Solomon by  his wife, and that Chretien's source, as he himself claims, was literary  (cf. Gaston Paris in \"Journal des Savants\", 1902, pp. 641-655). The  scene where Fenice feigns death in order to rejoin her lover is a  parallel of many others in literary history, and will, of course,  suggest the situation in Romeo and Juliet. This romance well illustrates  the drawing power of Arthur's court as a literary centre, and its use as  a rallying-point for courteous knights of whatever extraction. The poem  has been termed an \"Anti-Tristan\", because of its disparaging reference  to the love of Tristan and Iseut, which, it is generally supposed,  had been narrated by Chretien in his earlier years. Next may come  \"Lancelot\", with its significant dedication to the Countess of  Champagne. Of all the poet's work, this tale of the rescue of Guinevere  by her lover seems to express most closely the ideals of Marie's court  ideals in which devotion and courtesy but thinly disguise free love.  \"Yvain\" is a return to the poet's natural bent, in an episodical  romance, while \"Perceval\" crowns his production with its pure and  exalted note, though without a touch of that religious mysticism  which later marked Wolfram yon Eschenbach's \"Parzival\". \"Guillaime  d'Angleterre\" is a pseudo-historical romance of adventure in which the  worldly distresses and the final reward of piety are conventionally  exposed. It is uninspired, its place is difficult to determine, and  its authorship is questioned by some. It is aside from the Arthurian  material, and there is no clue to its place in the evolution of  Chretien's art, if indeed it be his work.    A few words must be devoted to Chretien's place in the history of  mediaeval narrative poetry. The heroic epic songs of France, devoted  either to the conflict of Christendom under the leadership of France  against the Saracens, or else to the strife and rivalry of French  vassals among themselves, had been current for perhaps a century before  our poet began to write. These epic poems, of which some three score  have survived, portray a warlike, virile, unsentimental feudal society,  whose chief occupation was fighting, and whose dominant ideals were  faith in God, loyalty to feudal family ties, and bravery in battle.  Woman's place is comparatively obscure, and of love-making there is  little said. It is a poetry of vigorous manhood, of uncompromising  morality, and of hard knocks given and taken for God, for Christendom,  and the King of France. This poetry is written in ten- or twelve-  syllable verses grouped, at first in assonanced, later in rhymed,  \"tirades\" of unequal length. It was intended for a society which was  still homogeneous, and to it at the outset doubtless all classes of the  population listened with equal interest. As poetry it is monotonous,  without sense of proportion, padded to facilitate memorisation by  professional reciters, and unadorned by figure, fancy, or imagination.  Its pretention to historic accuracy begot prosaicness in its approach  to the style of the chronicles. But its inspiration was noble, its  conception of human duties was lofty. It gives a realistic portrayal of  the age which produced it, the age of the first crusades, and to this  day we would choose as our models of citizenship Roland and Oliver  rather than Tristan and Lancelot. The epic poems, dealing with the  pseudo-historical characters who had fought in civil and foreign wars  under Charlemagne, remained the favourite literary pabulum of the middle  classes until the close of the thirteenth century. Professor Bedier  is at present engaged in explaining the extraordinary hold which these  poems had upon the public, and in proving that they exercised a distinct  function when exploited by the Church throughout the period of  the crusades to celebrate local shrines and to promote muscular  Christianity. But the refinement which began to penetrate the ideals of  the French aristocracy about the middle of the twelfth century craved a  different expression in narrative literature. Greek and Roman mythology  and history were seized upon with some effect to satisfy the new demand.  The \"Roman de Thebes\", the \"Roman d'Alexandre\", the \"Roman de  Troie\", and its logical continuation, the \"Roman d'Eneas\", are all  twelfth-century attempts to clothe classic legend in the dress of  mediaeval chivalry. But better fitted to satisfy the new demand was the  discovery by the alert Anglo-Normans perhaps in Brittany, perhaps in the  South of England, of a vast body of legendary material which, so far as  we know, had never before this century received any elaborate literary  treatment. The existence of the literary demand and this discovery of  the material for its prompt satisfaction is one of the most remarkable  coincidences in literary history. It would seem that the pride of the  Celtic populations in a Celtic hero, aided and abetted by Geoffrey of  Monmouth, who first showed the romantic possibilities of the material,  made of the obscure British chieftain Arthur a world conqueror. Arthur  thus became already in Geoffrey's \"Historia regum Britaniae\" a conscious  protagonist of Charlemagne and his rival in popularity. This grandiose  conception of Arthur persisted in England, but this conception of the  British chieftain did not interest the French. For Chretien Arthur had  no political significance. He is simply the arbiter of his court in all  affairs of justice and courtesy. Charlemagne's very realistic entourage  of virile and busy barons is replaced by a court of elegant chevaliers  and unemployed ladies. Charlemagne's setting is historical and  geographical; Arthur's setting is ideal and in the air. In the oldest  epic poems we find only God-fearing men and a few self-effacing women;  in the Arthurian romances we meet gentlemen and ladies, more elegant and  seductive than any one in the epic poems, but less fortified by  faith and sense of duty against vice because breathing an enervating  atmosphere of leisure and decadent morally. Though the Church made the  attempt in \"Parzival\", it could never lay its hands so effectively upon  this Celtic material, because it contained too many elements which  were root and branch inconsistent with the essential teachings of  Christianity. A fleeting comparison of the noble end of Charlemagne's  Peers fighting for their God and their King at Ronceval with the futile  and dilettante careers of Arthur's knights in joust and hunt, will show  better than mere words where the difference lies.    The student of the history of social and moral ideals will find much to  interest him in Chretien's romances. Mediaeval references show that he  was held by his immediate successors, as he is held to-day when fairly  viewed, to have been a master of the art of story-telling. More than any  other single narrative poet, he was taken as a model both in France and  abroad. Professor F. M. Warren has set forth in detail the finer points  in the art of poetry as practised by Chretien and his contemporary  craftsmen (see \"Some Features of Style in Early French Narrative Poetry,  1150-1170 in \"Modern Philology\", iii., 179-209; iii., 513-539; iv.,  655-675). Poets in his own land refer to him with reverence, and foreign  poets complimented him to a high degree by direct translation and by  embroidering upon the themes which he had made popular. The knights made  famous by Chretien soon crossed the frontiers and obtained rights of  citizenship in counties so diverse as Germany, England, Scandinavia,  Holland, Italy, and to a lesser extent in Spain and Portugal. The  inevitable tendency of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to reduce  poetry to prose affected the Arthurian material; vast prose compilations  finally embodied in print the matter formerly expressed in verse, and it  was in this form that the stories were known to later generations until  revived interest in the Middle Ages "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#3)"],[1,"med, for their eyes met; then  hers were hastily averted.    \"Blinder's\" quick eye followed those of Rob. \"A fair maid, that,\" he  said smilingly, \"and one more worthy the golden arrow than the Sheriff's  haughty miss.\"    Rob looked at him swiftly, and saw naught but kindliness in his glance.    \"You are a shrewd fellow and I like you well,\" was his only comment.    Now the archers prepared to shoot again, each with some little care. The  target seemed hardly larger than the inner ring had looked, at the first  trial. The first three sped their shafts, and while they were fair shots  they did not more than graze the inner circle.    Rob took his stand with some misgiving. Some flecking clouds overhead  made the light uncertain, and a handful of wind frolicked across the  range in a way quite disturbing to a bowman's nerves. His eyes wandered  for a brief moment to the box wherein sat the dark-eyed girl. His heart  leaped! she met his glance and smiled at him reassuringly. And in that  moment he felt that she knew him despite his disguise and looked to him  to keep the honor of old Sherwood. He drew his bow firmly and, taking  advantage of a momentary lull in the breeze, launched the arrow straight  and true-singing across the range to the center of the target.    \"The beggar! the beggar! a bull! a bull!\" yelled the fickle mob,  who from jeering him were now his warm friends. \"Can you beat that,  Blinder?\"    The last archer smiled scornfully and made ready. He drew his bow with  ease and grace and, without seeming to study the course, released the  winged arrow. Forward it leaped toward the target, and all eyes followed  its flight. A loud uproar broke forth when it alighted, just without the  center and grazing the shaft sent by Rob. The stranger made a gesture  of surprise when his own eyes announced the result to him, but saw his  error. He had not allowed for the fickle gust of wind which seized the  arrow and carried it to one side. But for all that he was the first to  congratulate the victor.    \"I hope we may shoot again,\" quoth he. \"In truth I care not for the  golden bauble and wished to win it in despite of the Sheriff for whom I  have no love. Now crown the lady of your choice.\" And turning suddenly  he was lost in the crowd, before Rob could utter what it was upon his  lips to say, that he would shoot again with him.    And now the herald summoned Rob to the Sheriff's box to receive the  prize.    \"You are a curious fellow enough,\" said the Sheriff, biting his lip  coldly; \"yet you shoot well. What name go you by?\"    Marian sat near and was listening intently.    \"I am called Rob the Stroller, my Lord Sheriff,\" said the archer.    Marian leaned back and smiled.    \"Well, Rob the Stroller, with a little attention to your skin and  clothes you would not be so bad a man,\" said the Sheriff. \"How like you  the idea of entering my service.    \"Rob the Stroller has ever been a free man, my Lord, and desires no  service.\"    The Sheriff's brow darkened, yet for the sake of his daughter and the  golden arrow, he dissembled.    \"Rob the Stroller,\" said he, \"here is the golden arrow which has been  offered to the best of archers this day. You are awarded the prize. See  that you bestow it worthily.\"    At this point the herald nudged Rob and half inclined his head toward  the Sheriff's daughter, who sat with a thin smile upon her lips. But Rob  heeded him not. He took the arrow and strode to the next box where sat  Maid Marian.    \"Lady,\" he said, \"pray accept this little pledge from a poor stroller  who would devote the best shafts in his quiver to serve you.\"    \"My thanks to you, Rob in the Hood,\" replied she with a roguish twinkle  in her eye; and she placed the gleaming arrow in her hair, while the  people shouted, \"The Queen! the Queen!\"    The Sheriff glowered furiously upon this ragged archer who had refused  his service, taken his prize without a word of thanks, and snubbed his  daughter. He would have spoken, but his proud daughter restrained him.  He called to his guard and bade them watch the beggar. But Rob had  already turned swiftly, lost himself in the throng, and headed straight  for the town gate.    That same evening within a forest glade a group of men--some twoscore  clad in Lincoln green--sat round a fire roasting venison and making  merry. Suddenly a twig crackled and they sprang to their feet and seized  their weapons.    \"I look for the widow's sons,\" a clear voice said, \"and I come alone.\"    Instantly the three men stepped forward.    \"Tis Rob!\" they cried; \"welcome to Sherwood Forest, Rob!\" And all the  men came and greeted him; for they had heard his story.    Then one of the widow's sons, Stout Will, stepped forth and said:    \"Comrades all, ye know that our band has sadly lacked a leader--one of  birth, breeding, and skill. Belike we have found that leader in this  young man. And I and my brothers have told him that the band would  choose that one who should bring the Sheriff to shame this day and  capture his golden arrow. Is it not so?\"    The band gave assent.    Will turned to Rob. \"What news bring you from Nottingham town?\" asked  he.    Rob laughed. \"In truth I brought the Sheriff to shame for mine own  pleasure, and won his golden arrow to boot. But as to the prize ye must  e'en take my word, for I bestowed it upon a maid.\"    And seeing the men stood in doubt at this, he continued: \"But I'll  gladly join your band, and you take me, as a common archer. For there  are others older and mayhap more skilled than I.\"    Then stepped one forward from the rest, a tall swarthy man. And Rob  recognized him as the man with the green blinder; only this was now  removed, and his freed eye gleamed as stoutly as the other one.    \"Rob in the Hood--for such the lady called you,\" said he, \"I can vouch  for your tale. You shamed the Sheriff e'en as I had hoped to do; and we  can forego the golden arrow since it is in such fair hands. As to your  shooting and mine, we must let future days decide. But here I, Will  Stutely, declare that I will serve none other chief save only you.\"    Then good Will Stutely told the outlaws of Rob's deeds, and gave him his  hand of fealty. And the widow's sons did likewise, and the other members  every one, right gladly; because Will Stutely had heretofore been the  truest bow in all the company. And they toasted him in nut brown ale,  and hailed him as their leader, by the name of Robin Hood. And he  accepted that name because Maid Marian had said it.    By the light of the camp-fire the band exchanged signs and passwords.  They gave Robin Hood a horn upon which he was to blow to summon them.  They swore, also, that while they might take money and goods from the  unjust rich, they would aid and befriend the poor and the helpless; and  that they would harm no woman, be she maid, wife, or widow. They swore  all this with solemn oaths, while they feasted about the ruddy blaze,  under the greenwood tree.    And that is how Robin Hood became an outlaw.          CHAPTER II    HOW ROBIN HOOD MET LITTLE JOHN         \"O here is my hand,\" the stranger reply'd,       \"I'll serve you with all my whole heart.       My name is John Little, a man of good mettle,       Ne'er doubt me for I'll play my part.\"         \"His name shall be altered,\" quoth William Stutely,       \"And I will his godfather be:       Prepare then a feast, and none of the least,       For we will be merry,\" quoth he.    All that summer Robin Hood and his merry men roamed in Sherwood Forest,  and the fame of their deeds ran abroad in the land. The Sheriff of  Nottingham waxed wroth at the report, but all his traps and excursions  failed to catch the outlaws. The poor people began by fearing them, but  when they found that the men in Lincoln green who answered Robin Hood's  horn meant them no harm, but despoiled the oppressor to relieve the  oppressed, they 'gan to have great liking for them. And the band  increased by other stout hearts till by the end of the summer fourscore  good men and true had sworn fealty.    But the days of quiet which came on grew irksome to Robin's adventurous  spirit. Up rose he, one gay morn, and slung his quiver over his  shoulders.    \"This fresh breeze stirs the blood, my lads,\" quoth he, \"and I would  be seeing what the gay world looks like in the direction of Nottingham  town. But tarry ye behind in the borders of the forest, within earshot  of my bugle call.\"    Thus saying he strode merrily forward to the edge of the wood, and  paused there a moment, his agile form erect, his brown locks flowing  and his brown eyes watching the road; and a goodly sight he made, as the  wind blew the ruddy color into his cheeks.    The highway led clear in the direction of the town, and thither he  boldly directed his steps. But at a bend in the road he knew of a  by-path leading across a brook which made the way nearer and less open,  into which he turned. As he approached the stream he saw that it had  become swollen by recent rains into quite a pretty torrent. The log  foot-bridge was still there, but at this end of it a puddle intervened  which could be crossed only with a leap, if you would not get your feet  wet.    But Robin cared little for such a handicap. Taking a running start, his  nimble legs carried him easily over and balanced neatly upon the end of  the broad log. But he was no sooner started across than he saw a tall  stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon Robin quickened his pace,  and the stranger did likewise, each thinking to cross first. Midway they  met, and neither would yield an inch.    \"Give way, fellow!\" roared Robin, whose leadership of a band, I am  afraid, had not tended to mend his manners.    The stranger smiled. He was almost a head taller than the other.    \"Nay,\" he retorted, \"fair and softly! I give way only to a better man  than myself.\"    \"Give way, I say\", repeated Robin, \"or I shall have to show you a better  man.\"    His"]]]
