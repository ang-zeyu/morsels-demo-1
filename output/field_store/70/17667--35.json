But it is the path of _bhakti_ or devotion to a personal God which  commands Krishna's strongest approval and leads him to make his startling  revelation. 'Have your mind in Me, be devoted to Me. To Me shall you come.  What is true I promise. Dear are you to Me. They who make Me their supreme  object, they to Me are dear. Though I am the unborn, the changeless Self,  I condition my nature and am born by my power. To save the good and  destroy evildoers, to establish the right, I am born from age to age. He  who knows this when he comes to die is not reborn but comes to Me.' He  speaks, in fact, as Vishnu himself.    This declaration is to prove the vital clue to Krishna's character. It is  to be expanded in later texts and is to account for the fervour with which  he is soon to be adored. For the present, however, his claim is in the  nature of an aside. After the battle, he resumes his life as a prince and  it is more for his shrewdness as a councillor than his teaching as God  that he is honoured and revered. Yet special majesty surrounds him and  when, thirty-six years after the conflict, a hunter mistakes him for a  deer and kills him by shooting him in the right foot[8], the Pandavas are  inconsolable. They retreat to the Himalayas, die one by one and are  translated to Indra's heaven[9].    Such an account is obviously a great advance on the _Chandogya Upanishad_.  Yet, as we ponder its intricate drama, we are faced with several  intractable issues. It is true that a detailed character has emerged, a  figure who is identified with definite actions and certain clear-cut  principles. It is true also that his character as Vishnu has been  asserted. But it is Krishna the feudal hero who throughout the story  takes, by far, the leading part. Between this hero and Krishna the God,  there is no very clear connection. The circumstances in which Vishnu has  taken form as Krishna are nowhere made plain. Except on the two occasions  mentioned, Krishna is apparently not recognized as God by others and does  not himself claim this status. Indeed it is virtually only as an  afterthought that the epic is used to transmit his great sermon, and  almost by accident that he becomes the most significant figure in the  story. Even the sermon at first sight seems at variance with his actions  as a councillor--his repeated recourse to treachery ill consorting with  the paramountcy of duty. In point of fact, such a conflict can be easily  reconciled for if God is supreme, he is above and beyond morals. He can  act in any way he pleases and yet, as God, can expect and receive the  highest reverence. God, in fact, is superior to ethics. And this viewpoint  is, in fact, to prove a basic assumption in later versions of the story.  Here it is sufficient to note that while the _Mahabharata_ describes these  two contrasting modes of behaviour, no attempt is made to face the exact  issue. Krishna as God has been introduced rather than explained and we are  left with the feeling that much more than has been recorded remains to be  said.    This feeling may well have dogged the writers who put the _Mahabharata_  into its present shape for, a little later, possibly during the sixth  century A.D., an appendix was added. This appendix was called the  _Harivansa_ or Genealogy of Krishna[10] and in it were provided all those  details so manifestly wanting in the epic itself. The exact nature of  Krishna is explained--the circumstances of his birth, his youth and  childhood, the whole being welded into a coherent scheme. In this story  Krishna the feudal magnate takes a natural place but there is no longer  any contradiction between his character as a prince and his character as  God. He is, above all, an incarnation of Vishnu and his immediate purpose  is to vanquish a particular tyrant and hearten the righteous. This  viewpoint is maintained in the _Vishnu Purana_, another text of about the  sixth century and is developed and illustrated in the tenth and eleventh  books of the _Bhagavata Purana_. It is this latter text--a vast compendium  of perhaps the ninth or tenth century--which affords the fullest account  in literature of Krishna's story.

The king is the successor of the Pandavas but is doomed to die  within a week for having by accident insulted a holy ascetic. To ensure  his salvation, he spends the week listening to the _Bhagavata Purana_ and  concentrating his mind on Krishna whom he declares to be his helper.[11]    Book Ten begins by describing the particular situation which leads to  Krishna's birth. The scene is Mathura, a town in northern India, adjoining  the kingdom of the Kauravas. The surrounding country is known as Braj and  its ruling families are the Yadavas. Just outside Mathura is the district  of Gokula which is inhabited by cowherds. These are on friendly terms with  the Yadavas, but are inferior to them in caste and status. The time is  some fifty years or more before the battle of Kurukshetra and the ruling  king is Ugrasena. Ugrasena's queen is Pavanarekha and a mishap to her sets  in train a series of momentous events.    One day she is taking the air in a park, when she misses her way and finds  herself alone. A demon, Drumalika, is passing and, entranced by her grace,  decides to ravish her. He takes the form of her husband, Ugrasena, and  despite Pavanarekha's protests proceeds to enjoy her. Afterwards he  assumes his true shape. Pavanarekha is dismayed but the demon tells her  that he has given her a son who will 'vanquish the nine divisions of the  earth, rule supreme and fight Krishna.' Pavanarekha tells her maids that a  monkey has been troubling her. Ten months later a son is born. He is named  Kansa and the court rejoices.    As Kansa grows up he reveals his demon's nature. He ignores his father's  words, murders children and defeats in battle King Jarasandha of  Magadha.[12] The latter gives him two daughters in marriage. He then  deposes his father, throws him into prison, assumes his powers and bans  the worship of Vishnu. As his crimes increase, he extends his conquests.  At last Earth can bear the burden no longer and appeals to the gods to  approach the supreme Deity, Brahma, to rid her of the load. Brahma as  Creator can hardly do this, but Vishnu as Preserver agrees to intervene  and plans are laid. Among the Yadava nobility are two upright persons. The  first is Devaka, the younger brother of King Ugrasena and thus an uncle to  the tyrant. The second is a certain Vasudeva. Devaka has six daughters,  all of whom he marries to Vasudeva. The seventh is called Devaki. Vishnu  announces that Devaki will also be married to Vasudeva, and plucking out  two of his hairs--one black and one white--he declares that these will be  the means by which he will ease Earth's burden. The white hair is part of  Sesha, the great serpent, which is itself a part of Vishnu and this will  be impersonated as Devaki's seventh child. The black hair is Vishnu's own  self which will be impersonated as Devaki's eighth child. The child from  the white hair will be known as Balarama and the child from the black hair  as Krishna. As Krishna, Vishnu will then kill Kansa. Earth is gratified  and retires and the stage is set for Krishna's coming.    Devaki, with Kansa's approval, is now married to Vasudeva. The wedding is  being celebrated in the grandest manner when a voice from heaven is heard  saying, 'Kansa, the eighth son of her whom you are now escorting will  cause your destruction. You shall die at his hand.' Kansa is greatly  alarmed and is about to slay Devaki when Vasudeva agrees to yield him all  their sons. Kansa accordingly spares her. Each of Devaki's first six sons,  however, is delivered up at birth and each is slaughtered.    As the time for fulfilling the prophecy approaches, Kansa grows fearful.  He learns that gods and goddesses are being born as cowherds and cowgirls  and, interpreting this as a sign that Krishna's birth is near, he commands  his men to slaughter every cowherd in the city. A great round-up ensues  and many cowherds are killed. The leading cowherd is a wealthy herdsman  named Nanda, who lives with his wife Yasoda in the country district of  Gokula. Although of lower caste, he is Vasudeva's chief friend and in view  of the imminent dangers confronting his family, it is to Nanda that  Vasudeva now sends one of his other wives, Rohini. Devaki has meanwhile  conceived her seventh son, the white hair of Vishnu, and soon to be  recognized as Krishna's brother. To avoid his murder by Kansa, Vishnu has  the foetus transferred from Devaki's womb to that of Rohini, and the  child, named Balarama, is born to Rohini, Kansa being informed that Devaki  has miscarried. The eighth pregnancy now occurs. Kansa increases his  precautions. Devaki and Vasudeva are handcuffed and manacled. Guards are  mounted and besides these, elephants, lions and dogs are placed outside.  The unborn child, however, tells them not to fear and Devaki and Vasudeva  compose their minds.    Krishna is now born, dark as a cloud and with eyes like lotuses. He is  clad in a yellow vest and wears a crown. He takes the form of Vishnu and  commands Vasudeva to bear him to Nanda's house in Gokula and substitute  him for the infant daughter who has just been born to Yasoda, Nanda's  wife."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11930"],[0,"More Fables (#4)"],[1," the Hurry-Up Wagon. Under which Circumstances  the Colonel had the Rabies.    [Illustration: MR. WINFIELD]    At the Police Station he was dragged before a Magistrate and was charged  with Disorderly Conduct, Carrying Concealed Weapons, Assault and  Battery, Assault with Intent to Kill, and Resisting an Officer.    The Magistrate was a White Man, and to him the Colonel appealed for  Justice, claiming Brotherhood as a Caucasian. He told what would have  happened in Apahatchie if any Coon had dared to lay a finger on a  Colonel.    Here was an opening for the Court. It must be known that the Court lived  in a Ward that was Dark in one End, and he was out for the Colored Vote  in case he ran for Judge. This was his Chance to make a Grand-Stand  Play.    He handed down a Decision to the Effect that all Men are Free and Equal,  with incidental References to the Emancipation Proclamation and Striking  the Shackles from Four Millions of Human Beings. He Ratified the  Constitution and Permitted the Negro to stand in the Free Sunlight. In  Apahatchie County he would have been used for Target Practice, but  Apahatchie County was still Eight Hundred Miles away.    In Conclusion he Soaked the Colonel for $32.75 in Fines and Costs,  Confiscating the Weapon, which he afterward presented to Officer Otis  Beasley as a Slight Token of Esteem.    Next Morning, as a south-bound Passenger Train was crossing the Ohio  River, the Colored Porter on the Atlanta Sleeper jumped eighty feet from  the Trestle into the Water in order to Escape with his Life.    MORAL: _A Head Waiter must be Ruled by Kindness_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ CORPORATION DIRECTOR _AND THE_ MISLAID AMBITION      One of the Most Promising Boys in a Graded School had a Burning Ambition  to be a Congressman. He loved Politics and Oratory. When there was a  Rally in Town he would carry a Torch and listen to the Spellbinder with  his Mouth open.    The Boy wanted to grow up and wear a Black String Tie and a Bill Cody  Hat and walk stiff-legged, with his Vest unbuttoned at the Top, and be  Distinguished.    On Friday Afternoons he would go to School with his Face scrubbed to a  shiny pink and his Hair roached up on one side, and he would Recite the  Speeches of Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster and make Gestures.    When he Graduated from the High School he delivered an Oration on \"The  Duty of the Hour,\" calling on all young Patriots to leap into the Arena  and with the Shield of Virtue quench the rising Flood of Corruption. He  said that the Curse of Our Times was the Greed for Wealth, and he  pleaded for Unselfish Patriotism among those in High Places.    He boarded at Home for a while without seeing a chance to jump into the  Arena, and finally his Father worked a Pull and got him a Job with a  Steel Company. He proved to be a Handy Young Man, and the Manager sent  Him out to make Contracts. He stopped roaching his Hair, and he didn't  give the Arena of Politics any serious Consideration except when the  Tariff on Steel was in Danger.    [Illustration: AMBITIOUS YOUTH]    In a little while he owned a few Shares, and after that he became a  Director. He joined several Clubs and began to enjoy his Food. He drank  a Small Bottle with his Luncheon each Day, and he couldn't talk Business  unless he held a Scotch High Ball in his Right Hand.    With the return of Prosperity and the Formation of the Trust and the  Whoop in all Stocks he made so much Money that he was afraid to tell the  Amount.    His Girth increased--he became puffy under the Eyes--you could see the  little blue Veins on his Nose.    He kept his Name out of the Papers as much as possible, and he never  gave Congress a Thought except when he talked to his Lawyer of the  Probable Manner in which they would Evade any Legislation against  Trusts. He took two Turkish Baths every week and wore Silk Underwear.  When an Eminent Politician would come to his Office to shake him down he  would send out Word by the Boy in Buttons that he had gone to Europe.  That's what he thought of Politics.    One day while rummaging in a lower Drawer in his Library, looking for a  Box of Poker Chips, he came upon a Roll of Manuscript and wondered what  it was. He opened it and read how it was the Duty of all True Americans  to hop into the Arena and struggle unselfishly for the General Good. It  came to him in a Flash--this was his High School Oration!    Then suddenly he remembered that for several Years of his Life his  consuming Ambition had been--to go to Congress!    With a demoniacal Shriek he threw himself at full length on a Leather  Couch and began to Laugh.    He rolled off the Sofa and tossed about on a $1,200 Rug in a Paroxysm of  Merriment.    His Man came running into the Library and saw the Master in Convulsions.  The poor Trust Magnate was purple in the Face.    They sent for a Great Specialist, who said that his Dear Friend had  ruptured one of the smaller Arteries, and also narrowly escaped Death by  Apoplexy.    [Illustration: THE MAGNATE]    He advised Rest and Quiet and the avoidance of any Great Shock.    So they took the High School Oration and put it on the Ice, and the  Magnate slowly recovered and returned to his nine-course Dinners.    MORAL: _Of all Sad Words of Tongue or Pen, the Saddest are these, \"It  Might Have Been.\"_          _THE_ FABLE _OF_ WHAT HAPPENED _THE_ NIGHT THE MEN CAME _TO THE_ WOMEN'S  CLUB      In a Progressive Little City claiming about twice the Population that  the Census Enumerators could uncover, there was a Literary Club. It was  one of these Clubs guaranteed to fix you out with Culture while you  wait. Two or three Matrons, who were too Heavy for Light Amusements, but  not old enough to remain at Home and Knit, organized the Club. Nearly  every Woman in town rushed to get in, for fear somebody would say she  hadn't been Asked.    The Club used to Round Up once a week at the Homes of Members. There  would be a Paper, followed by a Discussion, after which somebody would  Pour.    The Organization seemed to be a Winner. One Thing the Lady Clubbers were  Dead Set On. They were going to have Harmony with an Upper Case H. They  were out to cut a seven-foot Swath through English Literature from  Beowulf to Bangs, inclusive, and no petty Jealousies or Bickerings would  stand in the Way.    So while they were at the Club they would pull Kittenish Smiles at each  other, and Applaud so as not to split the Gloves. Some times they would  Kiss, too, but they always kept their Fingers crossed.    Of course, when they got off in Twos and Threes they would pull the  little Meat-Axes out of the Reticules and hack a few Monograms, but that  was to have been expected.    [Illustration: WYCLIF]    Everything considered, the Club was a Tremendous Go. At each Session the  Lady President would announce the Subject for the next Meeting. For  instance, she would say that Next Week they would take up Wyclif. Then  every one would romp home to look in the Encyclopedia of Authors and  find out who in the world Wyclif was. On the following Thursday they  would have Wyclif down Pat, and be primed for a Discussion. They would  talk about Wyclif as if he had been down to the House for Tea every  evening that Week.    After the Club had been running for Six Months it was beginning to be  Strong on Quotations and Dates. The Members knew that Mrs. Browning was  the wife of Mr. Browning, that Milton had Trouble with his Eyes, and  that Lord Byron wasn't all that he should have been, to say the Least.  They began to feel their Intellectual Oats. In the meantime the  Jeweler's Wife had designed a Club Badge.    The Club was doing such Notable Work that some of the Members thought  they ought to have a Special Meeting and invite the Men. They wanted to  put the Cap-Sheaf on a Profitable Season, and at the same time hand the  Merited Rebuke to some of the Husbands and Brothers who had been making  Funny Cracks.    It was decided to give the Star Programme at the Beadle Home, and after  the Papers had been read then all the Men and Five Women who did not  hold Office could file through the Front Room and shake Hands with the  President, the Vice-President, the Recording Secretary, the  Corresponding Secretary, the Treasurer, and the members of the various  Committees, all of whom were to line up and Receive.    The reason the Club decided to have the Brain Barbecue at the Beadle  Home was that the Beadles had such beautiful big Rooms and Double Doors.  There was more or less quiet Harpoon Work when the Announcement was  made. Several of the Elderly Ones said that Josephine Beadle was not a  Representative Member of the Club. She was Fair to look upon, but she  was not pulling very hard for the Uplifting of the Sex. It was suspected  that she came to the Meetings just to Kill Time and see what the Others  were Wearing. She refused to buckle down to Literary Work, for she was a  good deal more interested in the Bachelors who filled the Windows of the  new Men's Club than she was in the Butler who wrote \"Hudibras.\" So why  should she have the Honor of entertaining the Club at the Annual  Meeting? Unfortunately, the Members who had the most Doing under their  Bonnets were not the ones who could come to the Front with large Rooms  that could be Thrown together, so the Beadle Home got the Great Event.    [Illustration: THE MEN]    Every one in Town who carried a Pound of Social Influence showed up in  his or her Other Clothes. Extra Chairs had to be brought in, and what  with the Smilax and Club Colors it was very Swell, and the Maiden in the  Lace Mitts who was going to write about it for the Weekly threw a couple  of Spasms.    The Men were led in pulling at the Halters and with their Ears laid  back. After they got into the Dressing Room they Stuck there until they  had to be Shooed out. They did not know what they were going against,  but they had their Suspicions. They managed to get Rear Seats or stand  along"]]]
