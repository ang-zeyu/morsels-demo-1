neither make thyself over wise:             why shouldest thou destroy thyself?    21:007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why             shouldest thou die before thy time?    21:007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also             from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God             shall come forth of them all.    21:007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which             are in the city.    21:007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and             sinneth not.    21:007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou             hear thy servant curse thee:    21:007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself             likewise hast cursed others.    21:007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but             it was far from me.    21:007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it             out?    21:007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out             wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness             of folly, even of foolishness and madness:    21:007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is             snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God             shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.    21:007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by             one, to find out the account:    21:007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a             thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not             found.    21:007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;             but they have sought out many inventions.    21:008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of             a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the             boldness of his face shall be changed.    21:008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in             regard of the oath of God.    21:008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil             thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.    21:008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say             unto him, What doest thou?    21:008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a             wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.    21:008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore             the misery of man is great upon him.    21:008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him             when it shall be?    21:008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the             spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there             is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver             those that are given to it.    21:008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work             that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man             ruleth over another to his own hurt.    21:008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the             place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where             they had so done: this is also vanity.    21:008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed             speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set             in them to do evil.    21:008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be             prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them             that fear God, which fear before him:    21:008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he             prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth             not before God.    21:008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be             just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the             wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth             according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also             is vanity.    21:008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing             under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for             that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,             which God giveth him under the sun.    21:008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the             business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that             neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)    21:008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out             the work that is done under the sun: because though a man             labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;             though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able             to find it.    21:009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all             this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are             in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by             all that is before them.    21:009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the             righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,             and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that             sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that             sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.    21:009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,             that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the             sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart             while they live, and after that they go to the dead.    21:009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for             a living dog is better than a dead lion.    21:009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not             any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory             of them is forgotten.    21:009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now             perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any             thing that is done under the sun.    21:009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a             merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.    21:009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no             ointment.    21:009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of             the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the             sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in             this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.    21:009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for             there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in             the grave, whither thou goest.    21:009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the             swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the             wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour             to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.    21:009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are             taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the             snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it             falleth suddenly upon them.    21:009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed             great unto me:    21:009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came             a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great             bulwarks against it:    21:009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his             wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same             poor man.    21:009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the             poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.    21:009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of             him that ruleth among fools.    21:009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner             destroyeth much good.    21:010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth             a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in             reputation for wisdom and honour.    21:010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at             his left.    21:010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his             wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a             fool.    21:010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy             place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.    21:010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error             which proceedeth from the ruler:    21:010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.    21:010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as             servants upon the earth.    21:010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh             an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.    21:010:009"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#3)"],[1,"  me.

Nothing, I trust, that you will ever have reason to    repent.  (Offering to embrace her.)         CAS. (withdrawing from him).  Nay, Luiz, it may not be.  I    have embraced you for the last time.         LUIZ (amazed).  Casilda!         CAS.  I have just learnt, to my surprise and indignation,    that I was wed in babyhood to the infant son of the King of    Barataria!         LUIZ.  The son of the King of Barataria?

Why, I have often told you that my    mother was the nurse to whose charge he was entrusted!         CAS.  True.  I had forgotten.  Well, he has been discovered,    and my father has brought me here to claim his hand.         LUIZ.  But you will not recognize this marriage?  It took    place when you were too young to understand its import.         CAS.  Nay, Luiz, respect my principles and cease to torture    me with vain entreaties.  Henceforth my life is another's.         LUIZ.  But staythe present and the futurethey are    another's; but the pastthat at least is ours, and none can take    it from us.  As we may revel in naught else, let us revel in    that!         CAS.  I don't think I grasp your meaning.         LUIZ.  Yet it is logical enough.  You say you cease to love    me?         CAS. (demurely).  I say I may not love you.         LUIZ.  Ah, but you do not say you did not love me?         CAS.  I loved you with a frenzy that words are powerless to    expressand that but ten brief minutes since!         LUIZ.  Exactly.  My ownthat is, until ten minutes since,    my ownmy lately loved, my recently adoredtell me that until,    say a quarter of an hour ago, I was all in all to thee!    (Embracing her.)         CAS.  I see your idea.  It's ingenious, but don't do that.    (Releasing herself.)         LUIZ.  There can be no harm in revelling in the past.         CAS.  None whatever, but an embrace cannot be taken to act    retrospectively.         LUIZ.  Perhaps not!         CAS.  We may recollect an embraceI recollect manybut we    must not repeat them.         LUIZ.  Then let us recollect a few!  (A moment's pause, as    they recollect, then both heave a deep sigh.)         LUIZ.  Ah, Casilda, you were to me as the sun is to the    earth!         CAS.  A quarter of an hour ago?         LUIZ.  About that.         CAS.  And to think that, but for this miserable discovery,    you would have been my own for life!         LUIZ.

How greedily my thirsty ears would have drunk the    golden melody of those sweet words a quarterwell, it's now    about twenty minutes since.  (Looking at her watch.)         LUIZ.  About that.  In such a matter one cannot be too    precise.         CAS.  And now our love, so full of life, is but a silent,    solemn memory!         LUIZ.  Must it be so, Casilda?         CAS.  Luiz, it must be so!                           DUETCASILDA and LUIZ.      LUIZ.          There was a time                        A time for ever goneah, woe is me!                   It was no crime                        To love but thee aloneah, woe is me!

Oh, bury, bury love that all condemn,              And let the whirlwind mourn its requiem!      CAS.           Dead as the last year's leaves                        As gathered flowersah, woe is me!                   Dead as the garnered sheaves,                        That love of oursah, woe is me!                   Born but to fade and die                        When hope was high,                   Dead and as far away                        As yesterday!ah, woe is me!      BOTH.     Oh, bury, burylet the grave close o'er, etc.      (Re-enter from the Ducal Palace the Duke and Duchess, followed by    Don Alhambra del Bolero, the Grand Inquisitor.)           DUKE.

Distinctly jimp.  Allow me!  (Offers his hand.  She    turns away scornfully.)  Naughty temper!         DUKE.  You must make some allowance.  Her Majesty's head is    a little turned by her access of dignity.         DON AL.  I could have wished that Her Majesty's access of    dignity had turned it in this direction.         DUCH.
