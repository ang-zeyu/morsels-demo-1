If we do not attempt to realize this ideal we      are guilty of a dereliction of the highest moral trust that can      devolve upon a nation.\"    I will now ask the attention of the House for a moment while I examine  a group of communications from officers of the Indian Government, and  if the House will allow me I will tell them what to my mind is the  result of all these communications as to the general feeling in India.  That, after all, is what most concerns us. For this unrest in the  Punjab and Bengal sooner or later--and sooner, rather than later, I  hope--will pass away. What is the situation of India generally in the  view of these experienced officers at this moment? Even now when we  are passing through all the stress and anxiety, it is a mistake not to  look at things rather largely. They all admit that there is a fall in  the influence of European officers over the population. They all, or  nearly all, admit that there is estrangement--I ought to say, perhaps,  refrigeration--between officers and people. There is less sympathy  between the Government and the people. For the last few years--and  this is a very important point--the doctrine of administrative  efficiency has been pressed too hard. The wheels of the huge machine  have been driven too fast. Our administration--so shrewd observers  and very experienced observers assure me--would be a great deal more  popular if it was a trifle less efficient, a trifle more elastic  generally. We ought not to put mechanical efficiency at the head of  our ideas. I am leading up to a practical point. The district officers  representing British rule to the majority of the people of India, are  overloaded with work in their official relations, and I know there are  highly experienced gentlemen who say that a little of the looseness of  earlier days is better fitted than the regular system of latter days,  to win and to keep personal influence, and that we are in danger of  creating a pure bureaucracy. Honourable, faithful, and industrious the  servants of the State in India are and will be, but if the present  system is persisted in, there is a risk of its becoming rather  mechanical, perhaps I might even say rather soulless; and attention to  this is urgently demanded. Perfectly efficient administration, I need  not tell the House, has a tendency to lead to over-centralisation. It  is inevitable. The tendency in India is to override local authority,  and to force administration to run in official grooves. For my own  part I would spare no pains to improve our relations with native  Governments, and more and more these relations may become of potential  value to the Government of India. I would use my best endeavours to  make these States independent in matters of administration. Yet all  evidence tends to show we are rather making administration less  personal, though evidence also tends to show that the Indian people  are peculiarly responsive to sympathy and personal influence. Do not  let us waste ourselves in controversy, here or elsewhere, or in mere  anger; let us try to draw to our side the men who now influence the  people. We have every good reason to believe that most of the people  of India are on our side. I do not say for a moment that they like us.  It does not come easy, in west or east, to like foreign rule. But in  their hearts they know that their solid interest is bound up with the  law and order that we preserve.    There is a Motion on the Paper for an inquiry by means of a  Parliamentary Committee or Royal Commission into the causes at the  root of the dissatisfaction. Now, I have often thought, while at  the India Office, whether it would be a good thing to have the  old-fashioned parliamentary inquiry by committee or commission. I have  considered this, I have discussed it with others; and I have come  to the conclusion that such inquiry would not produce any of the  advantages such as were gained in the old days of old committees, and  certainly would be attended by many drawbacks. But I have determined,  after consulting with the Viceroy, that considerable advantage might  be gained by a Royal Commission to examine, with the experience we  have gained over many years, into this great mischief--for all the  people in India who have any responsibility know that it is a great  mischief--of over-centralisation. It seemed a great mischief to so  acute a man as Sir Henry Maine, who, after many years' experience,  wrote expressing agreement with what Mr. Bright said just before or  just after the Mutiny, that the centralised government of India was  too much power for any one man to work. Now, when two men, singularly  unlike in temperament and training, agreed as to the evil of  centralisation on this large scale, it compels reflection. I will not  undertake at the present time to refer to the Commission the large  questions that were spoken of by Maine and Bright, but I think that  much might be gained by an inquiry on the spot into the working of  centralisation of government in India, and how in the opinions of  trained men here and in India, the mischief might be alleviated. That,  however, is not a question before us now.    You often hear people talk of the educated section of the people of  India as a mere handful, an infinitesimal fraction. So they are,  in numbers; but it is fatally idle to say that this infinitesimal  fraction does not count. This educated section is making and will make  all the difference. That they would sharply criticise the British  system of government has been long known. It was inevitable. There  need be no surprise in the fact that they want a share in political  influence, and want a share in the emoluments of administration. Their  means--many of them--are scanty; they have little to lose and much to  gain from far-reaching changes. They see that the British hand works  the State machine surely and smoothly, and they think, having no fear  of race animosities, that their hand could work the machine as surely  and as smoothly as the British hand.    And now I come to my last point. Last autumn the Governor-General  appointed a Committee of the Executive Council to consider the  development of the administrative machinery, and at the end of March  last he publicly informed his Legislative Council that he had sent  home a despatch to the Secretary of State proposing suggestions for  a move in advance. The Viceroy with a liberal and courageous mind  entered deliberately on the path of improvement. The public in India  were aware of it. They waited, and are now waiting the result with  the liveliest interest and curiosity. Meanwhile the riots happened  in Rawalpindi, in Lahore. After these riots broke out, what was the  course we ought to take? Some in this country lean to the opinion--and  it is excusable--that riots ought to suspend all suggestions and talk  of reform. Sir, His Majesty's Government considered this view, and in  the end they took, very determinedly, the opposite view. They held  that such a withdrawal would, of course, have been construed as a  triumph for the party of sedition. They held that, to draw back on  account of local and sporadic disturbances, however serious, anxious,  and troublesome they might be, would have been a really grave  humiliation. To hesitate to make a beginning with our own policy of  improving the administrative machinery of the Indian Government, would  have been taken as a sign of nervousness, trepidation, and fear; and  fear, that is always unworthy in any Government, is in the Indian  Government, not only unworthy, but extremely dangerous. I hope the  House concurs with His Majesty's Government.    In answer to a Question the other day, I warned one or two of my  hon. friends that, in resisting the employment of powers to suppress  disturbances, under the Regulation of 1818 or by any other lawful  weapon we could find, they were promoting the success of that  disorder, which would be fatal to the very projects with which they  sympathise. The despatch from India reached us in due course. It was  considered by the Council of India and by His Majesty's Government,  and our reply was sent about a fortnight ago. Someone will ask--Are  you going to lay these two despatches on the Table to-day? I hope the  House will not take it amiss if I say that at this stage--perhaps at  all stages--it would be wholly disadvantageous to lay the despatches  on the Table. We are in the middle of the discussion to-day, and it  would break up steady continuity if we had a premature discussion  _coram populo_. Everyone will understand that discussions of this kind  must be very delicate, and it is of the utmost importance that they  should be conducted with entire freedom. But, to employ a word that  I do not often use, I might adumbrate the proposals. This is how  the case stands. The despatch reached His Majesty's Government, who  considered it. We then set out our views upon the points raised in  the despatch. The Government of India will now frame what is called a  Resolution. That draft Resolution, when framed by them in conformity  with the instructions of His Majesty's Government, will in due course  be sent here. We shall consider that draft, and then it will be my  duty to present it to this House if legislation is necessary, as it  will be; and it will be published in India to be discussed there by  all those concerned....    The main proposal is the acceptance of the general principle of  a substantial enlargement of Legislative Councils, both the  Governor-General's Legislative Council and the Provincial Legislative  Councils. Details of this reform have to be further discussed in  consultation with the local Governments in India, but so far it is  thought best in India that an official majority must be maintained.  Again, in the discussion of the Budget in the Viceroy's Council the  subjects are to be grouped and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#4)"],[1,"time the thought ever haunted me as to what should be  done for young children. At length the germ was developed at one of  the Sunday Schools, which were then rising into general notice. For  years I attended one of these in London, and here circumstances again  befriended me, regarding the matter so frequently in my thoughts. The  teachers mostly preferred having a class to superintend that knew  something, and I being then a junior, it fell to my lot to have a  class that knew little or nothing. I mean nothing that it was the  object of the Sunday-school to teach. It soon appeared clear to me,  that such a class required different treatment to those more advanced,  and especially the _young_ children. Nobody wanted this class, it was  always \"to let,\" if I did not take it. The result was, I always had  it. Others looked to the post of honour, the Bible-class. I soon found  that to talk to such children as I had to teach, in the manner the  others did to the older and more advanced children, was useless, and  thus I was forced to simplify my mode of teaching to suit their state  of apprehension, and now and then even to amuse them. This succeeded  so well, that in the end my class became the popular class, and I  became still further convinced of the desirableness of an _especial  plan for teaching the very young_. I, however, still thought that the  alphabet should be taught first, with the usual things in their order.  At length, shortly after my marriage, which was rather early in life,  an opportunity presented itself for trying an experiment on a larger  scale; from having explained my views on early education to a friend,  I was solicited to take the superintendence of an asylum for young  children, about to be formed in a populous part of London. Having thus  an opportunity of carrying out my wishes, thoughts, and feelings, in  a way that I could not have anticipated, I gave up my connexion with  business, and devoted myself to the object. Great and unforseen  difficulties however had to be encountered. The first week was  dreadful. I began with too many children, and we had six whom the  mothers afterwards confessed they sent to _wean_. These not only cried  themselves, but set all the others crying also, and we regretted  having begun the experiment. At length, driven almost to despair, it  became evident that something new must be done to still the tumult. As  an expedient, I elevated a cap on a pole, which immediately attracted  their attention and occasioned silence. Thus I obtained a clue to  guide me, and my mind instantly perceived one of the most fundamental  principles in infant teaching, in fact of most teaching, and which  long experience has proved true, and that is, to appeal to the SENSES  of the children. After this, every day developed something new to me,  the children became happy beyond my expectations, and my course  onward was gradually progressive. Children and teachers became happy  together; difficulties vanished as we proceeded, and at length my wife  and I made up our minds to devote our whole lives to the perfecting of  our plans, and the carrying them out extensively. The novelty of the  thing drew numbers of visitors to a district, where the carriages of  the nobility and gentry had not been seen before; but the labour to us  was so greatly increased by this, that my wife sunk under it, and I  was left with four young children, to prosecute my plans alone in the  world.    From the day I caught the idea, that a great secret in teaching the  young was to teach through the _senses_, the various implements now in  such general use in infant schools, were step by step invented by me.  Objects of all kinds were introduced, and oral lessons given upon  them, to teach their qualities and properties, and amongst the various  visitors most frequently present at such times, was the gentleman who  has acquired fame by publishing \"Lessons on Objects,\" which little  work has elsewhere been highly commended by me, albeit it came forth  into the world several years after the period I now speak of. To give  such lessons I found it requisite to have the children altogether, so  as better to attract their attention simultaneously. This was first  attempted by placing them at one end of the room, but it was found  inconvenient; then parallel lines were chalked across the floor, and  they sat down in order on these; but though attention was gained, the  posture was unsuitable. Cords were then stretched across to keep them  in proper rank, and various experiments tried with seats, until they  ended in the construction of a permanently fixed gallery of regularly  ascending seats. This implement or structure has now come into almost  universal use in infant schools, and, in fact, they are considered  incomplete without one; and also they are in much request in schools  for children of every age. To give an idea of number through the eye,  I had recourse at first to buttons strung on strings across a frame,  and this led to the substitution of wooden balls on wires, and other  improvements through experience, until the arithmeticon, hereafter  described, was fully formed. It having been found a useful instrument,  the credit of contriving it has been impugned, by liking it to the  Roman Abacus and Chinese Swanpan; but were those instruments like in  structure, or designed especially to teach the multiplication table?  if not, they are no more similar than \"a hawk to a hand-saw.\" The  former I have never seen, and the first time I saw one of the Chinese  instruments was some five or six years ago in the Museum at Hull. The  clapping of hands, the moving of arms, marching in order, and  various other motions, all of which are now become the especial  characteristics of an infant-school, were gradually introduced as  circumstances or nature dictated, partly to obtain simultaneous action  and obedience, and partly to provide that physical exercise which  beings so young perpetually require, and which they are constantly  taking when left free and unrestrained. It is not requisite to make  mention here of the swing--the play grounds--the flower borders--and  various other matters which are fully treated of in the following  portions of this work, further than to add, that they are now  generally adopted in schools, and especially in some of the principal  training establishments in the British Empire. As these plans and  instruments are used by a certain religious infant-school society,  which professes to have imported its system from Switzerland,  where such things never had their origin, I feel it necessary most  emphatically to repeat, that they are entirely of my own invention.    After the severe bereavement mentioned above, I still persevered in  my favourite study, and learned more from my own children than I did  before, having to act in the double capacity of father and mother. I  am well aware of the loss my children sustained by the above calamity.  In the matter of training, nothing can replace a good mother,--and  such indeed she eminently was! I felt the heavy stroke more severely,  and my children did also; but I consoled myself with the reflection,  that my loss was her gain, and that she had lived to witness fruits of  her unparalleled labours, to the thorough abandonment of self, and the  glory of her Maker. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these  little ones, ye have done it unto me.\" Night and day, when I had time  to think, such promises as these cheered and sustained me in doing  what I could for my own motherless children, and more and more  cemented my affections on the children of others, and, finally,  enabled me to mature my plans, and gave me strength and courage to  carry them out, first in the villages and places near London, and,  ultimately, single-handed and alone, through more than a quarter of  a century, in many of the chief cities, towns, and villages of the  United Kingdom. Simply to state this fact is all that is requisite  here to answer my present purpose, and to enlarge more upon it is  needless, as a full detail of the whole career is given in my \"Early  Discipline Illustrated; or, the Infant System Progressing and  Successful,\" third edition, published in 1840, and to which much  more would require adding to bring it down to the present time, if a  further edition should be called for.    That prejudice should assail me, and objections be started as I came  more out into the world, was to be expected. I knew my own intentions,  but the world did not, and I came in for a full share of obloquy and  persecution. This did me much good, and was a preparatory discipline,  to make me careless of the opinion of mankind in the matter, so long  as I felt that I was in the right, and had the approval of my own  conscience. The more I was opposed, the more were my energies lighted  up and strengthened; opposition always sharpened my faculties, instead  of overcoming and depressing me. The whole gradually prospered from  the first, under every disadvantage and notwithstanding the strenuous  efforts of the short-sighted and bigoted. These things laid my first  patrons prostrate, and the Society of great names which followed, was  soon dissolved. Every effort was made by the enemies of true training  and education, to crush the thing in the bud, and not only the thing,  but also the man who developed it and worked it out. Thank God, these  inimical aims did not succeed. Though worldly patrons failed, I had  one Patron who never deserted me, but Who upheld and encouraged me  from first to last, until the end was gained. Not, however, all that  was aimed at, but much of it, and the rest will follow or I am greatly  mistaken. I have in various places seen things that I earnestly  contended for, but which were rejected at the time, at length  established and their value seen.
