During the  greater part of the seventeenth century, intrepid Jesuit priests are  associated with some of the most heroic incidents of Canadian history.    When Champlain died, on Christmas-day, 1635, the French population of  Canada did not exceed 150 souls, all dependent on the fur-trade. Canada  so far showed none of the elements of prosperity; it was not a colony  of settlers but of fur-traders. Still Champlain, by his indomitable  will, gave to France a footing in America which she was to retain for a  century and a quarter after his death. His courage amid the difficulties  that surrounded him, his fidelity to his church and country, his ability  to understand the Indian character, his pure unselfishness, are among  the remarkable qualities of a man who stands foremost among the pioneers  of European civilization in America.    From the day of Champlain's death until the arrival of the Marquis de  Tracy, in 1665, Canada was often in a most dangerous and pitiable  position. That period of thirty years was, however, also distinguished  by the foundation of those great religious communities which have always  exercised such an important influence upon the conditions of life  throughout French Canada. In 1652 Montreal was founded under the name of  Ville-Marie by Paul Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, and a number of  other religious enthusiasts. In 1659, the Abbe de Montigny, better known  to Canadians as Monseigneur de Laval, the first Roman Catholic bishop,  arrived in the colony and assumed charge of ecclesiastical affairs under  the titular name of Bishop of Petraea. Probably no single man has ever  exercised such powerful and lasting influence on Canadian institutions  as that famous divine. Possessed of great tenacity of purpose, most  ascetic in his habits, regardless of all worldly considerations, always  working for the welfare and extension of his church, Bishop Laval was  eminently fitted to give it that predominance in civil as well as  religious affairs which it so long possessed in Canada.    While the Church of Rome was perfecting its organization throughout  Canada, the Iroquois were constantly making raids upon the unprotected  settlements, especially in the vicinity of Montreal. The Hurons in the  Georgian Bay district were eventually driven from their comfortable  villages, and now the only remnants of a powerful nation are to be found  in the community of mixed blood at Lorette, near Quebec, or on the  banks of the Detroit River, where they are known as Wyandots. The Jesuit  mission of Sainte-Marie in their country was broken up, and Jean de  Brebeuf and Gabriel Lalemant suffered torture and death.    Such was the pitiable condition of things in 1663, when Louis XIV made  of Canada a royal government. At this time the total population of the  province did not exceed 2500 souls, grouped chiefly in and around  Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal. In 1665 the Marquis de Tracy and  Governor de Courcelles, with a brilliant retinue of officers and a  regiment of soldiers, arrived in the colony, and brought with them  conditions of peace and prosperity. A small stream of immigration flowed  steadily into the country for some years, as a result of the new policy  adopted by the French government. The Mohawks, the most daring and  dangerous nation of the Iroquois confederacy, were humbled by Tracy in  1667, and forced to sue for peace. Under the influence of Talon, the  ablest intendant who ever administered Canadian affairs, the country  enjoyed a moderate degree of prosperity, although trade continued  entirely dependent on the orders and regulations of the King and his  officials.    Among the ablest governors of Canada was undoubtedly Louis de la Buade,  Count de Frontenac, who administered public affairs from 1672-1687 and  from 1689-1698. He was certainly impatient, choleric and selfish  whenever his pecuniary interests were concerned; but, despite his faults  of character, he was a brave soldier, dignified and courteous on  important occasions, a close student of the character of the Indians,  always ready when the necessity arose to adapt himself to their foibles  and at the same time able to win their confidence. He found Canada weak,  and left it a power in the affairs of America. He infused his own  never-failing confidence into the hearts of the struggling colonists on  the St. Lawrence, repulsed Sir William Phipps and his New England  expedition when they attacked Quebec in 1690, wisely erected a fort on  Lake Ontario as a fur-trading post and a bulwark against the Iroquois,  encouraged the fur-trade, and stimulated exploration in the west and in  the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi. The settlements of New  England trembled at his name, and its annals contain many a painful  story of the misery inflicted by his cruel bands of Frenchmen and  Indians.    Despite all the efforts of the French government for some years, the  total immigration from 1663 until 1713, when the great war between  France and the Grand Alliance came to an end by the treaty of Utrecht,  did not exceed 6000 souls, and the whole population of the province in  that year was only 20,000, a small number for a century of colonization.  For some years after the formation of the royal government, a large  number of marriageable women were brought to the country under the  auspices of the religious communities, and marriages and births were  encouraged by exhortations and bounties. A considerable number of the  officers and soldiers of the Carignan-Salieres regiment, who followed  the Marquis de Tracy into Canada, were induced to remain and settle new  seigniories, chiefly in palisaded villages in the Richelieu district for  purposes of defence against Iroquois expeditions. Despite all the  paternal efforts of the government to stimulate the growth of a large  population, the natural increase was small during the seventeenth  century. The disturbing influence, no doubt, was the fur-trade, which  allured so many young men into the wilderness, made them unfit for a  steady life, and destroyed their domestic habits. The emigrants from  France came chiefly from Anjou, Saintonge, Paris and its suburbs,  Normandy, Poitou, Beauce, Perche, and Picardy. The Carignan-Salieres  regiment brought men from all parts of the parent state. It does not  appear that any number of persons ever came from Brittany. The larger  proportion of the settlers were natives of the north-western provinces  of France, especially from Perche and Normandy, and formed an excellent  stock on which to build up a thrifty, moral people. The seigniorial  tenure of French Canada was an adaptation of the feudal system of France  to the conditions of a new country, and was calculated in some respects  to stimulate settlement. Ambitious persons of limited means were able to  form a class of colonial _noblesse_. But unless the seignior cleared a  certain portion of his grant within a limited time, he would forfeit it  all. The conditions by which the _censitaires_ or tenants of the  seigniorial domain held their grants of land were by no means  burdensome, but they signified a dependency of tenure inconsistent with  the free nature of American life. A large portion of the best lands of  French Canada were granted under this seigniorial system to men whose  names frequently occur in the records of the colony down to the present  day: Rimouski, Bic and Metis, Kamouraska, Nicolet, Vercheres,  Lotbiniere, Berthier, Beloeil, Rouville, Juliette, Terrebonne,  Champlain, Sillery, Beaupre, Bellechasse, Portneuf, Chambly, Sorel,  Longueuil, Boucherville, Chateauguay, Lachine, are memorials of the  seigniorial grants of the seventeenth century.    The whole population of the Acadian Peninsula in 1710-13, was not more  than 1500 souls, nearly all descendants of the people brought to the  country by Poutrincourt and his successors Razilly and Charnisay. At no  time did the French government interest itself in immigration to  neglected Acadia. Of the total population, nearly 1000 persons were  settled in the beautiful country which the industry and ingenuity of the  Acadian peasants, in the course of many years, reclaimed from the  restless tides of the Bay of Fundy at Grand Pre and Minas. The remaining  settlements were at Beau Bassin, Annapolis, Piziquit (now Windsor),  Cobequit (now Truro), and Cape Sable. Some small settlements were also  founded on the banks of the St. John River and on the eastern bays of  the present province of New Brunswick.      SECTION 3.--French exploration in the great valleys of North America.    The hope of finding a short route to the rich lands of Asia by the St.  Lawrence River and its tributary lakes and streams, influenced French  voyagers and explorers well into the middle of the eighteenth century.  When Cartier stood on Mount Royal and saw the waters of the Ottawa there  must have flashed across his mind the thought that perhaps by this river  would be found that passage to the western sea of which he and other  sailors often dreamed both in earlier and later times. L'Escarbot tells  us that Champlain in his western explorations always hoped to reach Asia  by a Canadian route. He was able, however, long before his death to  make valuable contributions to the geography of Canada. He was the first  Frenchman to ascend the River of the Iroquois, now the Richelieu, and to  see the beautiful lake which still bears his name. In 1615 he found his  way to Georgian Bay by the route of the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers, Lake  Nipissing and French River. Here he visited the Huron villages which  were situated in the district now known as Simcoe county in the province  of Ontario. Father le Caron, a Recollet, had preceded the French  explorer, and was performing missionary duties among the Indians, who  probably numbered 20,000 in all.

Far violet hills, horizons filmed with showers,        The murmur of cool streams, the forest's gloom,        The voices of the breathing grass, the hum      Of ancient gardens overbanked with flowers:      Thus, with a smile as golden as the dawn,        And cool fair fingers radiantly divine,        The mighty mother brings us in her hand,      For all tired eyes and foreheads pinched and wan,      Her restful cup, her beaker of bright wine:        Drink, and be filled, and ye shall understand!          AT THE FERRY          On such a day the shrunken stream        Spends its last water and runs dry;      Clouds like far turrets in a dream        Stand baseless in the burning sky.      On such a day at every rod        The toilers in the hay-field halt,      With dripping brows, and the parched sod        Yields to the crushing foot like salt.        But here a little wind astir,        Seen waterward in jetting lines,      From yonder hillside topped with fir        Comes pungent with the breath of pines;      And here when all the noon hangs still,        White-hot upon the city tiles,      A perfume and a wintry chill        Breathe from the yellow lumber-piles.        And all day long there falls a blur        Of noises upon listless ears,      The rumble of the trams, the stir        Of barges at the clacking piers;      The champ of wheels, the crash of steam,        And ever, without change or stay,      The drone, as through a troubled dream,        Of waters falling far away.        A tug-boat up the farther shore        Half pants, half whistles, in her draught;      The cadence of a creaking oar        Falls drowsily; a corded raft      Creeps slowly in the noonday gleam,        And wheresoe'er a shadow sleeps      The men lie by, or half a-dream,        Stand leaning at the idle sweeps.        And all day long in the quiet bay        The eddying amber depths retard,      And hold, as in a ring, at play,        The heavy saw-logs notched and scarred;      And yonder between cape and shoal,        Where the long currents swing and shift,      An aged punt-man with his pole        Is searching in the parted drift.        At moments from the distant glare        The murmur of a railway steals      Round yonder jutting point the air        Is beaten with the puff of wheels;      And here at hand an open mill,        Strong clamor at perpetual drive,      With changing chant, now hoarse, now shrill,        Keeps dinning like a mighty hive.        A furnace over field and mead,        The rounding noon hangs hard and white;      Into the gathering heats recede        The hollows of the Chelsea height;      But under all to one quiet tune,        A spirit in cool depths withdrawn,      With logs, and dust, and wrack bestrewn,        The stately river journeys on.        I watch the swinging currents go        Far down to where, enclosed and piled,      The logs crowd, and the Gatineau        Comes rushing from the northern wild.      I see the long low point, where close        The shore-lines, and the waters end,      I watch the barges pass in rows        That vanish at the tapering bend.        I see as at the noon's pale core--        A shadow that lifts clear and floats--      The cabin'd village round the shore,        The landing and the fringe of boats;      Faint films of smoke that curl and wreathe,        And upward with the like desire      The vast gray church that seems to breathe        In heaven with its dreaming spire.        And there the last blue boundaries rise,        That guard within their compass furled      This plot of earth: beyond them lies        The mystery of the echoing world;      And still my thought goes on, and yields        New vision and new joy to me,      Far peopled hills, and ancient fields,        And cities by the crested sea.        I see no more the barges pass,        Nor mark the ripple round the pier,      And all the uproar, mass on mass,        Falls dead upon a vacant ear.      Beyond the tumult of the mills,        And all the city's sound and strife,      Beyond the waste, beyond the hills,        I look far out and dream of life.          SEPTEMBER          Now hath the summer reached her golden close,        And, lost amid her corn-fields, bright of soul,      Scarcely perceives from her divine repose        How near, how swift, the inevitable goal:      Still, still, she smiles, though from her careless feet        The bounty and the fruitful strength are gone,        And through the soft long wondering days goes on      The silent sere decadence sad and sweet.        The kingbird and the pensive thrush are fled,        Children of light, too fearful of the gloom;      The sun falls low, the secret word is said,        The mouldering woods grow silent as the tomb;      Even the fields have lost their sovereign grace,        The cone-flower and the marguerite; and no more,        Across the river's shadow-haunted floor,      The paths of skimming swallows interlace.        Already in the outland wilderness        The forests echo with unwonted dins;      In clamorous gangs the gathering woodmen press        Northward, and the stern winter's toil begins.      Around the long low shanties, whose rough lines        Break the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake,        Already in the frost-clear morns awake      The crash and thunder of the falling pines.        Where the tilled earth, with all its fields set free,        Naked and yellow from the harvest lies,      By many a loft and busy granary,        The hum and tumult of the thrashers rise;      There the tanned farmers labor without slack,        Till twilight deepens round the spouting mill,        Feeding the loosened sheaves, or with fierce will,      Pitching waist-deep upon the dusty stack.        Still a brief while, ere the old year quite pass,        Our wandering steps and wistful eyes shall greet      The leaf, the water, the beloved grass;        Still from these haunts and this accustomed seat      I see the wood-wrapt city, swept with light,        The blue long-shadowed distance, and, between,        The dotted farm-lands with their parcelled green,      The dark pine forest and the watchful height.        I see the broad rough meadow stretched away        Into the crystal sunshine, wastes of sod,      Acres of withered vervain, purple-gray,        Branches of aster, groves of goldenrod;      And yonder, toward the sunlit summit, strewn        With shadowy boulders, crowned and swathed with weed,        Stand ranks of silken thistles, blown to seed,      Long silver fleeces shining like the noon.        In far-off russet corn-fields, where the dry        Gray shocks stand peaked and withering, half concealed      In the rough earth, the orange pumpkins lie,        Full-ribbed; and in the windless pasture-field      The sleek red horses o'er the sun-warmed ground        Stand pensively about in companies,        While all around them from the motionless trees      The long clean shadows sleep without a sound.        Under cool elm-trees floats the distant stream,        Moveless as air; and o'er the vast warm earth      The fathomless daylight seems to stand and dream,        A liquid cool elixir--all its girth      Bound with faint haze, a frail transparency,        Whose lucid purple barely veils and fills        The utmost valleys and the thin last hills,      Nor mars one whit their perfect clarity.        Thus without grief the golden days go by,        So soft we scarcely notice how they wend,      And like a smile half happy, or a sigh,        The summer passes to her quiet end;      And soon, too soon, around the cumbered eaves        Sly frosts shall take the creepers by surprise,        And through the wind-touched reddening woods shall rise      October with the rain of ruined leaves.          A RE-ASSURANCE          With what doubting eyes, oh sparrow,          Thou regardest me,      Underneath yon spray of yarrow,          Dipping cautiously.        Fear me not, oh little sparrow,          Bathe and never fear,      For to me both pool and yarrow          And thyself are dear.          THE POET'S POSSESSION          Think not, oh master of the well-tilled field,      This earth is only thine; for after thee,      When all is sown and gathered and put by,      Comes the grave poet with creative eye,      And from these silent acres and clean plots,      Bids with his wand the fancied after-yield,      A second tilth and second harvest, be,      The crop of images and curious thoughts.          AN AUTUMN LANDSCAPE          No wind there is that either pipes or moans;        The fields are cold and still; the sky          Is covered with a blue-gray sheet          Of motionless cloud; and at my feet        The river, curling softly by,      Whispers and dimples round its quiet gray stones.        Along the chill green slope that dips and heaves        The road runs rough and silent, lined          With plum-trees, misty and blue-gray,          And poplars pallid as the day,        In masses spectral, undefined,      Pale greenish stems half hid in dry gray leaves.        And on beside the river's sober edge        A long fresh field lies black. Beyond,          Low thickets gray and reddish stand,          Stroked white with birch; and near at hand,        Over a little steel-smooth pond,      Hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge.
