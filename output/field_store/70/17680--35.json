The Egyptian language furnishes us with indisputable proof of the  Semitic affinity, as Professor Adolf Erman showed years ago.  The  anatomical examination by Professor Elliot Smith of a large  number of skeletons, dated by careful excavations, has given us a  further clue.  There is a prehistoric race found in the earliest  cemeteries--neither Negroid nor Asiatic in characteristics.  In  the late predynastic and the early dynastic periods, when the  great development began, this primitive race had become modified  by an infiltration of broad-headed people from the north.  In the  Old Empire, this broad-headed people had become predominant, and  remain so throughout all Lower and Middle Egypt until the present  day.  This intruding race, whose advent marks the beginning of  Egyptian civilization, I believe to have been Semitic.    Remember this--the texts show clearly older ideas in conflict  with the Osiris belief.  The primitive race was not, I believe, a  race of Osiris followers.  Professor Erman has stated that the  Osiris belief is as early as 4200 B.C.  That I am certain is  absolutely untenable.  It is a question of Egyptian chronology in  which I beg to differ radically both from Eduard Meyer and  Professor Erman.  In the formal calendar year of three hundred and  sixty-five days, there are twelve months of thirty days and five  intercalary days.  These intercalary days are called the birthdays  of Osiris, Horus, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys--the five most  important figures in the Osiris myth.  According to Professor  Meyer and Professor Erman, this formal calendar was introduced in  4200 B.C., one of the occasions when the heliacal rising of the  star Sothis fell on the first of the month Thoth of the calendar.  However, if we accept with them the date 3300 B.C. as the date of  the First dynasty, then in 4200 B.C. the Egyptians were just  emerging from a neolithic state.  They were culturally incapable  of making a formal calendar and could have no possible use for  one.  Either the calendar did not originate in Egypt, or it was  introduced in 2780 B.C., when again the heliacal rising Sothis  fell on the first of Thoth.  At this time the Osiris story was  dominant, in the religion.  We have a race almost certainly  Semitic, fusing the primitive race during the period 3500-3000,  and a few centuries later we have a new religious idea dominating  the fused race.  When we examine this new idea, the Osiris belief,  we find its earliest form nothing more nor less than the common  tammuz or Adonis story of the Semites.  The conclusion lies very  near at hand, that the Osiris story is in fact the Tammuz story,  brought into Egypt by the earliest Semitic tribes.  In any case it  was a race with a large Semitic mixture which utilized this story  in working out a theory of immortality; and in all probability we  have in the Osiris-Isis religion a third great religion due to  the Semitic race.    However this may be, it is clear that the craving of the king for  a special immortality, for an exalted future life, found its  justification through the Osiris-Isis myth.  Horus was the  successor of Osiris as lord of the earth and the living.  The  kings of Egypt were the successors of Horus.  The chief name of  the king was his Horus name; Menes was the Horus Aha, Cheops the  Horus Mejeru.  When the king died, he became Osiris, and passed to  the kingdom of Osiris.  He passed through the underworld with the  sun-god, abode there as Osiris, the god-king, or sped to the  heavens to the celestial gods.  Thus comes the entering wedge  of a great change in the conception of immortality--an ordinary  immortality for the common man, a special divine immortality  for the divine man, the king.  [It appears probable that the  deification of the king and the assumption of a divine immortality  for him was prior in time to the statement of these beliefs in  the terms of the Osiris story.]  Even at this early age, it  was, of course, clearly stated that the king must be righteous,  morally satisfactory in the eyes of the world and of the gods.  The gods, as always, were on the side of the moral code, and  especially on the side of the organized religion.  It is  perhaps significant that the chief sins of the kings of the  Fourth dynasty, so execrated by the Egyptian priests in the  Ptolemaic period, were sins against the great gods.  The other  charges are for the most part plainly slanders.  In practice every  king whose family remained in power was justified before gods and  men, and took his place among the gods in the islands of the  blessed in the northern part of the heavens.    The dead body was laid in the grave, supplied with all these  magic texts which were to restore and revive the soul and guide  it across waters and through dangers to the place of Osiris.  But  the chapel was not wanting, the cult of the _ka_ was maintained,  the statues were placed in the hidden room, the food and drink  were brought daily to the door of the grave.  Thus, while a  special immortality was evolved for the king, the funeral customs  continue to show the same service of the _ka_ as in the earlier  period.    In the Sixth Dynasty, there is a return to the older practice of  placing objects in the grave itself.  At present we are unable to  point out the reasons for this.  Possibly experience had taught  men that endowments and craved walls left to the care of  descendants were insecure supports for a life after death which  was to last forever.  At any rate, the custom arose of making  small models in wood or stone or metal of those scenes and  objects which were carved in relief on the walls of the chapel,  --models of houses, granaries, of kitchens, of brickyards;  models of herds and servants and soldiers; models of boats and  ships; models of dance-halls with the man seated drinking wine,  around him musicians, before him dancing girls; models of swords,  of vessels, of implements.  Poorer people must be contented with  poorer things, down to the peasant who is buried with the few  little necessary pots and pans of his daily life.  But always, in  every grave, the chapel, small or great, is there.  The endowment  of funerary priests continues.  Every man, I suppose, however  poor, had some one to make at least one offering at his grave.  And so it was down to the New Empire.          VI. THE MIDDLE EMPIRE      During the Middle Empire, the burial and offering customs show  the persistence of the old belief in life after death as on  earth.  Pots, vessels, tools, weapons, ornaments, clothing, and  models of scenes from life, continue to be placed in the burial  chamber.  The walls of the offering chambers of the nobles, at  this time cut in the rock, still bear representations from life  carved in relief.  The symbolical doors and the offering formulas  still mark the spot where the dead receive the necessities of  life from the living.  All graves of every class testify to the  faith in a life after death similar to life on earth.  Yet certain  modifications are apparent which are significant for the future  development of the conception of immortality: (1) the pyramid  texts are used by the provincial nobles for their own benefit;  (2) Abydos assumes a great importance as the burial place of  Osiris; (3) the swathed mummy comes into general use in burials.    The first identification of the king with Osiris in the pyramid  texts marks the conception of a better immortality for him.  So,  as the possibility of a better immortality was claimed by wider  and wider circles of men, the use of the pyramid texts, or  similar texts, also became wider.  In the Middle Empire, texts  practically identical with the pyramid texts, but furnished with  illustrations somewhat like those of the later books of the dead,  are found in the coffins of provincial nobles.    The power of the monarchy had been weakening during the Fifth and  Sixth Dynasties, partly owing to the dissipation of national  resources by royal extravagance, partly owing to other causes.  After the Sixth Dynasty, the country was clearly in a period of  economic depression; and the government was broken up into a  series of nearly independent baronies corresponding roughly to  the later division into provinces or nomes.  Our material is  scanty.  The tombs of very few great men have been found.  But when  in the Twelfth Dynasty an abundance of material is at hand, we  see, alongside the old forms of the burial customs, the use of  the pyramid texts on the inside walls of the coffins of the great  man.  It was now possible for the _ba_ of the great landed noble  to seek refuge with the gods in the northwest heavens and share  their life.    The increasing importance of Abydos as the burial place of Osiris  is of still greater significance.  The tomb of a king of the First  Dynasty was identified by the priests as the actual burial place  of Osiris.  Many great people made graves for themselves in the  same field; or, if they lived at a distance, built empty  cenotaphs there.  A great temple of Osiris stood near by, and  became the centre of the celebration of mysteries illustrating  the death and revival of Osiris.  Fortunately, a certain high  official named I-kher-nofret has left us an account of the Osiris  passion-play as performed under his oversight in the nineteenth  year of Sesostris III, nearly two thousand years before Christ  [See Schafer's article, \"Die Osiris-mysterien,\" in Sethe's  _Untersuchungen zur Geshichte Aegyptens_, IV, 2, pp 1-42.].  The  play began by the procession of the statue of the jackal-god  Wep-wawet (the road-opener) going forth to help his father  Osiris.  Then the statue of Osiris himself in the Neshemet boat  came forth as triumphant king of the earth.  Sham battles took  place referring to the conquest of the earth by Osiris."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#4)"],[1,"him for a question he had  a mind to ask us. After leave to ask what he pleased, it was if we  wanted any money for our journey, and pulled out two pistoles, which  he offered either to give or lend us.    I mention this exceeding courtesy of the curate because, though  civility is very much in use in France, and especially to strangers,  yet 'tis a very unusual thing to have them part with their money.    We let the priest know, first, that we did not want money, and next  that we were very sensible of the obligation he had put upon us; and  I told him in particular, if I lived to see him again, I would  acknowledge it.    This accident of our horse was, as we afterwards found, of some use  to us. We had left our two servants behind us at Calais to bring our  baggage after us, by reason of some dispute between the captain of the  packet and the custom-house officer, which could not be adjusted, and  we were willing to be at Paris. The fellows followed as fast as they  could, and, as near as we could learn, in the time we lost our way,  were robbed, and our portmanteaus opened. They took what they pleased;  but as there was no money there, but linen and necessaries, the loss  was not great.    Our guide carried us to Amiens, where we found the express and our two  servants, who the express meeting on the road with a spare horse, had  brought back with him thither.    We took this for a good omen of our successful journey, having escaped  a danger which might have been greater to us than it was to our  servants; for the highwaymen in France do not always give a traveller  the civility of bidding him stand and deliver his money, but  frequently fire on him first, and then take his money.    We stayed one day at Amiens, to adjust this little disorder, and  walked about the town, and into the great church, but saw nothing  very remarkable there; but going across a broad street near the great  church, we saw a crowd of people gazing at a mountebank doctor, who  made a long harangue to them with a thousand antic postures, and gave  out bills this way, and boxes of physic that way, and had a great  trade, when on a sudden the people raised a cry, \"_Larron, Larron_!\"  (in English, \"Thief, thief\"), on the other side the street, and all  the auditors ran away, from Mr Doctor to see what the matter was.  Among the rest we went to see, and the case was plain and short  enough. Two English gentlemen and a Scotchman, travellers as we were,  were standing gazing at this prating doctor, and one of them catched  a fellow picking his pocket. The fellow had got some of his money, for  he dropped two or three pieces just by him, and had got hold of  his watch, but being surprised let it slip again. But the reason of  telling this story is for the management of it. This thief had his  seconds so ready, that as soon as the Englishman had seized him they  fell in, pretended to be mighty zealous for the stranger, takes the  fellow by the throat, and makes a great bustle; the gentleman not  doubting but the man was secured let go his own hold of him, and left  him to them. The hubbub was great, and 'twas these fellows cried,  \"_Larron, larron_!\" but with a dexterity peculiar to themselves had  let the right fellow go, and pretended to be all upon one of their own  gang. At last they bring the man to the gentleman to ask him what the  fellow had done, who, when he saw the person they seized on, presently  told them that was not the man. Then they seemed to be in more  consternation than before, and spread themselves all over the street,  crying, \"_Larron, larron_!\" pretending to search for the fellow; and  so one one way, one another, they were all gone, the noise went over,  the gentlemen stood looking one at another, and the bawling doctor  began to have the crowd about him again. This was the first French  trick I had the opportunity of seeing, but I was told they have a  great many more as dexterous as this.    We soon got acquaintance with these gentlemen, who were going to  Paris, as well as we; so the next day we made up our company with  them, and were a pretty troop of five gentlemen and four servants.    As we had really no design to stay long at Paris, so indeed, excepting  the city itself, there was not much to be seen there. Cardinal  Richelieu, who was not only a supreme minister in the Church, but  Prime Minister in the State, was now made also General of the King's  Forces, with a title never known in France before nor since, viz.,  Lieutenant-General \"au place du Roi,\" in the king's stead, or, as some  have since translated it, representing the person of the king.    Under this character he pretended to execute all the royal powers in  the army without appeal to the king, or without waiting for orders;  and having parted from Paris the winter before had now actually begun  the war against the Duke of Savoy, in the process of which he restored  the Duke of Mantua, and having taken Pignerol from the duke, put it  into such a state of defence as the duke could never force it out of  his hands, and reduced the duke, rather by manage and conduct than  by force, to make peace without it; so as annexing it to the crown of  France it has ever since been a thorn in his foot that has always  made the peace of Savoy lame and precarious, and France has since made  Pignerol one of the strongest fortresses in the world.    As the cardinal, with all the military part of the court, was in the  field, so the king, to be near him, was gone with the queen and all  the court, just before I reached Paris, to reside at Lyons. All these  considered, there was nothing to do at Paris; the court looked like a  citizen's house when the family was all gone into the country, and  I thought the whole city looked very melancholy, compared to all the  fine things I had heard of it.    The queen-mother and her party were chagrined at the cardinal, who,  though he owed his grandeur to her immediate favour, was now grown too  great any longer to be at the command of her Majesty, or indeed in her  interest; and therefore the queen was under dissatisfaction and her  party looked very much down.    The Protestants were everywhere disconsolate, for the losses they had  received at Rochelle, Nimes, and Montpelier had reduced them to an  absolute dependence on the king's will, without all possible hopes of  ever recovering themselves, or being so much as in a condition to  take arms for their religion, and therefore the wisest of them plainly  foresaw their own entire reduction, as it since came to pass. And I  remember very well that a Protestant gentleman told me once, as we  were passing from Orleans to Lyons, that the English had ruined them;  and therefore, says he, \"I think the next occasion the king takes to  use us ill, as I know 'twill not be long before he does, we must all  fly over to England, where you are bound to maintain us for having  helped to turn us out of our own country.\" I asked him what he meant  by saying the English had done it? He returned short upon me: \"I do  not mean,\" says he, \"by not relieving Rochelle, but by helping to ruin  Rochelle, when you and the Dutch lent ships to beat our fleet, which  all the ships in France could not have done without you.\"    I was too young in the world to be very sensible of this before, and  therefore was something startled at the charge; but when I came to  discourse with this gentleman, I soon saw the truth of what he said  was undeniable, and have since reflected on it with regret, that the  naval power of the Protestants, which was then superior to the royal,  would certainly have been the recovery of all their fortunes, had it  not been unhappily broke by their brethren of England and Holland,  the former lending seven men-of-war, and the latter twenty, for the  destruction of the Rochellers' fleet; and by these very ships the  Rochellers' fleet were actually beaten and destroyed, and they never  afterwards recovered their force at sea, and by consequence sunk under  the siege, which the English afterwards in vain attempted to prevent.    These things made the Protestants look very dull, and expected the  ruin of all their party, which had certainly happened had the cardinal  lived a few years longer.    We stayed in Paris, about three weeks, as well to see the court and  what rarities the place afforded, as by an occasion which had like to  have put a short period to our ramble.    Walking one morning before the gate of the Louvre, with a design to  see the Swiss drawn up, which they always did, and exercised just  before they relieved the guards, a page came up to me, and speaking  English to me, \"Sir,\" says he, \"the captain must needs have your  immediate assistance.\" I, that had not the knowledge of any person  in Paris but my own companion, whom I called captain, had no room to  question, but it was he that sent for me; and crying out hastily to  him, \"Where?\" followed the fellow as fast as 'twas possible. He led  me through several passages which I knew not, and at last through a  tennis-court and into a large room, where three men, like gentlemen,  were engaged very briskly two against one. The room was very dark, so  that I could not easily know them asunder, but being fully possessed  with an opinion before of my captain's danger, I ran into the room  with my sword in my hand. I had not particularly engaged any of them,  nor so much as made a pass at any, when I received a very dangerous  thrust in my thigh, rather occasioned by my too hasty running in,  than a real design of the person; but enraged at the hurt, without  examining who it was hurt me, I threw myself upon him, and run my  sword quite through his body.    The novelty of the adventure, and the unexpected fall of the man by  a stranger come in nobody knew how, had becalmed the other two, that  they really stood gazing at me. By this time I had discovered that my  captain was not there, and that 'twas some strange"]]]
