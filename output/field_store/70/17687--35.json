Build the slices up one above the other,  alternating brown and white, and placing the unbuttered slice on top.  Before serving, slice down as you would a layer cake.      EGG AND OLIVE SANDWICHES    Chop four eggs which have been boiled fifteen minutes, add two  tablespoons of chopped olives, season and moisten with olive oil and  vinegar. Spread between thin slices of buttered bread.      RUSSIAN SANDWICHES    Spread bread with thin slices of Neufchatel cheese, cover with finely  chopped olives moistened with mayonnaise dressing.      SURPRISE SANDWICHES    Take orange marmalade, pecan nuts and cream cheese in equal quantities  and after mixing thoroughly spread on thin slices of buttered bread.      CHICKEN SANDWICHES    Mince some cold roast or boiled chicken in a chopping bowl, then mix the  gravy with it, adding a few hard-boiled eggs, which have been minced to  a powder. Mix all into a soft paste. Then cut thin slices of bread,  spread the chicken between the slices (if desired you may add a little  mustard); press the pieces gently together.      CHICKEN SANDWICHES WITH MAYONNAISE    Grind up chicken in meat chopper. To each cup of chicken add one  tablespoon of mayonnaise, and one tablespoon of chicken soup. Mix into  soft paste, and put in finger-rolls.      DEVILED TONGUE SANDWICHES    Grind up tongue (root will do) in meat chopper; to a cup of ground  tongue add one teaspoon of mustard, one tablespoon of soup, and one  teaspoon of mayonnaise. Mix into soft paste; spread on white bread cut  very thin.      MINCED GOOSE SANDWICHES    Take either boiled or roast goose (which has been highly seasoned) and  mince in a chopping bowl, add one or two pickles, according to quantity,  or a teaspoon of catsup. Spread thin slices of bread or nice fresh  rolls, with a thin coating of goose oil, slightly salted, then spread  the minced goose and cover with a layer of bread which has been  previously spread.      VEAL SANDWICHES    May be prepared as above, or slice the veal in thin slices and spread  with mustard.      BOILED, SMOKED, OR PICKLED TONGUE SANDWICHES    Remove the crust from the bread (unless it is very soft), place the  slices of tongue (cut very thin) and lettuce leaves between the  slices.          *SOUPS*      Soups are wholesome and palatable and should form part of the meal  whenever possible. It is a good plan to have some sort of vegetable or  meat stock always at hand, as this renders the making of the soup both  easy and economical. With milk at hand, cream soups are easily made.      SOUP STOCK    In making soup, bring the cold water in the soup pot with the meat and  bones to a boil slowly, and let it simmer for hours, never boiling and  never ceasing to simmer. If clear soup is not desired soup may be  allowed to boil. Bones, both fresh and those partly cooked, meats of all  kinds, vegetables of various sorts, all may be added to the stock pot,  to give flavor and nutriment to the soup.    One quart of cold water is used to each pound of meat for soup; to four  quarts of water, one each of vegetables of medium size and a bouquet.    Make the soup in a closely covered kettle used for no other purpose.  Remove scum when it first appears; after soup has simmered for four or  five hours add vegetables and a bouquet.    Parsley wrapped around peppercorn, bayleaf, six cloves and other herbs,  excepting sage, and tied, makes what is called a bouquet and may be  easily removed from the soup.    Root celery, parsley, onions, carrots, asparagus and potatoes are the  best vegetables to add to the soup stock. Never use celery leaves for  beef soup. You may use celery leaves in potato soup, but sparingly, with  chopped parsley leaves.    Vegetables, spices and salt should always be added the last hour of  cooking. Strain into an earthen bowl and let cool uncovered, by so doing  stock is less apt to ferment.    A cake of fat forms on the stock when cold, which excludes air and  should not be removed until stock is used. To remove fat run a knife  around edge of bowl and carefully remove the same. A small quantity will  remain, which should be removed by passing a cloth, wrung out of hot  water, around edge and over top of stock. This fat should be clarified  and used for drippings. If time cannot be allowed for stock to cool  before using, take off as much fat as possible with a spoon, and remove  the remainder by passing tissue or any absorbent paper over the surface.    Bouillon should always be thickened with _yolks_ of eggs, beat up with a  spoon of cold water. Ordinary beef soup or tomato soup may be thickened  with flour. To do this properly heat a scant spoon of soup drippings,  stir in briskly a spoon of flour, and add gradually a large quantity of  soup to prevent it becoming lumpy.      WHITE STOCK    Veal, turkey, chicken and fish are used.      BROWN STOCK    Follow directions given for bouillon, adding a slice of beef and  browning some of the meat in the marrow from the bone.      BEET SOUP--RUSSIAN STYLE (FLEISCHIG)    Cut one large beet and one-half pound of onion in thick pieces and put  in kettle with one pound of fat brisket of beef; cover with water and  let cook slowly two hours; add three-fourths of a cup of sugar and a  little citric acid to make it sweet and sour and let cook another hour;  season and serve hot.      BORSHT    Take some red beetroots, wash thoroughly and peel, and then boil in a  moderate quantity of water from two to three hours over a slow fire, by  which time a strong red liquor should have been obtained. Strain off the  liquor, adding lemon juice, sugar, and salt to taste, and when it has  cooled a little, stir in sufficient yolks of eggs to slightly thicken  it. May be used either cold or hot. In the latter case a little  home-made beef stock may be added to the beet soup.    If after straining off the soup the remaining beetroot is not too much  boiled away, it may be chopped fine with a little onion, vinegar and  dripping, flavored with pepper and salt, and used as a vegetable.      SCHALET OR TSCHOLNT (SHABBAS SOUP)    Wash one pint of white haricot beans and one pint of coarse barley and  put them into a covered pot or pan with some pieces of fat meat and some  pieces of marrow bone, or the backs of two fat geese which have been  skinned and well spiced with ginger and garlic. Season with pepper and  salt and add sufficient water to cover. Cover the pot up tightly. If one  has a coal range it can be placed in the oven on Friday afternoon and  let remain there until Saturday noon. The heat of the oven will be  sufficient to bake the Schalet if there was a nice clear fire when the  porridge was put in the oven. If this dish cannot be baked at home it  may be sent to a neighboring baker to be placed in the oven there to  remain until Saturday noon, when it is called for. This takes the place  of soup for the Sabbath dinner.      BOUILLON    Put on one three-pound chicken to boil in six quarts cold water. Take  one and one-half or two pounds of beef and the same quantity thick part  of veal, put in a baking-pan, set in the stove and brown quickly with  just enough water to keep from burning. When brown, cut the meat in  pieces, add this with all the juice it has drawn, to the chicken soup.  Set on the back of the stove, and cook slowly all day. Set in a cold  place, or on ice over night, and next morning after it is congealed,  skim off every particle of fat.    Melt and season to taste when ready to serve. Excellent for the sick.  When used for the table, cut up carrots and French peas already cooked  can be added while heating.    If cooked on gas stove, cook over the simmering flame the same number of  hours.      CONSOMME    Take three pounds of beef, cut in dice and cover with three quarts of  cold water. Simmer slowly for four hours. The last hour add one-half cup  each of carrots, celery, onion, and season with one-half teaspoon of  peppercorns and one tablespoon of salt. Strain, cool, remove fat and  clear (allowing one egg-shell broken fine and the slightly beaten white  of one egg to each quart of stock). Add to the stock, stir constantly  until it has reached the boiling point. Boil two minutes and serve.      CHICKEN SOUP, No. 1    Take one large chicken, cook with four quarts of water for two or three  hours. Skim carefully, when it begins to boil add parsley root, an  onion, some asparagus, cut into bits. Season with salt, strain and beat  up the yolk of an egg with one tablespoon of cold water, add to soup  just before serving. This soup should not be too thin. Rice, barley,  noodles or dumplings may be added. Make use of the chicken, either for  salad or stew.      CHICKEN SOUP, No. 2    Take the carcass of a cold, cooked chicken and break into small pieces.  Add one-half cup of chopped celery and one onion chopped fine. Cover  with cold water; simmer slowly for two hours. Strain, add salt and  pepper to taste.      CHICKEN BROTH    Cut the chicken into small pieces and place it in a deep earthen dish;  add one quart of water; cover it and set over a kettle of boiling water,  letting it steam until the meat of the chicken has become very tender.  Strain off the broth and let it stand over night. In the morning remove  the fat and return the liquid to the original earthen dish.      JULIENNE SOUP    Have soup stock ready. Boil in water until tender one cup green peas,  three carrots cut up in small pieces, and some cabbage chopped fine.  Brown two tablespoons of flour in a skillet in hot fat, then stir in the  vegetables. Fry some livers and gizzards of fowls, if handy, and add,  then stir in the strained soup stock.      RICE BROTH    May be made either of beef or mutton, adding all kinds of vegetables.  Boil one-half cup of rice separately in a farina kettle. Strain the beef  or mutton broth. Add the rice and boil one-half hour longer, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#4)"],[1,"law of contradiction, i. e., with the assumption  that nothing can have at the same time and at the same place  contradictory and inconsistent qualities or elements. For Hegel, on the  contrary, contradiction is the very moving principle of the world, the  pulse of its life. _Alle Dinge sind an sich selbst widersprechend_, as  he drastically says. The deeper reason why Hegel invests contradiction  with a positive value lies in the fact that, since the nature of  everything involves the union of discrepant elements, nothing can bear  isolation and independence. Terms, processes, epochs, institutions,  depend upon one another for their meaning, expression, and existence; it  is impossible to take anything in isolation. But this is just what one  does in dealing with the world in art or in science, in religion or in  business; one is always dealing with error and contradiction, because  one is dealing with fragments or bits of life and experience. Hence--and  this is Hegel's crowning thought--anything short of the whole universe  is inevitably contradictory. In brief, contradiction has the same sting  for Hegel as it has for any one else. Without losing its nature of  \"contradictoriness,\" contradiction has logically this positive meaning.  Since it is an essential element of every partial, isolated, and  independent view of experience and thought, one is necessarily led to  transcend it and to see the universe in organic wholeness.    Thus, as Hegel puts his fundamental idea, \"the truth is the whole.\"  Neither things nor categories, neither histories nor religions, neither  sciences nor arts, express or exhaust by themselves the whole essence of  the universe. The essence of the universe is the _life_ of the totality  of all things, not their _sum_. As the life of man is not the sum of his  bodily and mental functions, the whole man being present in each and all  of these, so must the universe be conceived as omnipresent in each of  its parts and expressions. This is the significance of Hegel's  conception of the universe as an organism. The World-Spirit--Hegel's  God--constitutes, thinks, lives, wills, and is _all_ in unity. The  evolution of the universe is thus the evolution of God himself.    The task of philosophy, then, as Hegel conceives it, is to portray in  systematic form the evolution of the World-Spirit in all its necessary  ramifications. These ramifications themselves are conceived as  constituting complete wholes, such as logic, nature, mind, society,  history, art, religion, philosophy, so that the universe in its onward  march through these is represented as a Whole of Wholes--_ein Kreis von  Kreisen_. In Hegel's complete philosophy each of these special spheres  finds its proper place and elaborate treatment.    Whether Hegel has well or ill succeeded in the task of exhibiting in  each and all of these spheres the one universal movement, whether or no  he was justified in reading into logic the same kind of development  manifested by life, or in making life conform to one logical  formula--these and other problems should arouse an interest in Hegel's  writings. The following selections may give some glimpse of their  spirit.    In conclusion, some bare suggestions must suffice to indicate the reason  for Hegel's great influence. Hegel has partly, if not wholly, created  the modern historical spirit. Reality for him, as even this inadequate  sketch has shown, is not static, but is essentially a process. Thus  until the history of a thing is known, the thing is not understood at  all. It is the becoming and not the being of the world that constitutes  its reality. And thus in emphasizing the fact that everything has a  \"past,\" the insight into which alone reveals its significant meaning,  Hegel has given metaphysical expression and impetus to the awakening  modern historical sense. His idea of evolution also epitomizes the  spirit of the nineteenth century with its search everywhere for geneses  and transformations--in religion, philology, geology, biology. Closely  connected with the predominance of the historical in Hegel's philosophy  is its explicit critique of individualism and particularism. According  to his doctrine, the individual as individual is meaningless. The  particular--independent and unrelated--is an abstraction. The isolation  of anything results in contradiction. It is only the whole that animates  and gives meaning to the individual and the particular. This idea of  subordinating the individual to universal ends, as embodied particularly  in Hegel's theory of the State, has left its impress upon political,  social, and economic theories of his century. Not less significant is  the glorification of reason of which Hegel's complete philosophy is an  expression. Reason never spoke with so much self-confidence and  authority as it did in Hegel. To the clear vision of reason the universe  presents no dark or mysterious corners, nay, the very negations and  contradictions in it are marks of its inherent rationality. But Hegel's  rationalism is not of the ordinary shallow kind. Reason he himself  distinguishes from understanding. The latter is analytical, its function  is to abstract, to define, to compile, to classify. Reason, on the other  hand, is synthetic, constructive, inventive. Apart from Hegel's special  use of the term, it is this synthetic and creative and imaginative  quality pervading his whole philosophy which has deepened men's insight  into history, religion, and art, and which has wielded its general  influence on the philosophic and literary constellation of the  nineteenth century.           *       *       *       *       *        GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL    INTRODUCTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY[1] (1837)    TRANSLATED BY J. SIBREE, M.A.      The subject of this course of lectures is the Philosophical History of  the World. And by this must be understood, not a collection of general  observations respecting it, suggested by the study of its records and  proposed to be illustrated by its facts, but universal history itself.  To gain a clear idea, at the outset, of the nature of our task, it seems  necessary to begin with an examination of the other methods of treating  history. The various methods may be ranged under three heads:       I. Original History.    II. Reflective History.   III. Philosophical History.    I. Of the first kind, the mention of one or two distinguished names will  furnish a definite type. To this category belong Herodotus, Thucydides,  and other historians of the same order, whose descriptions are for the  most part limited to deeds, events, and states of society, which they  had before their eyes and whose spirit they shared. They simply  transferred what was passing in the world around them to the realm of  re-presentative intellect; an external phenomenon was thus translated  into an internal conception. In the same way the poet operates upon the  material supplied him by his emotions, projecting it into an image for  the conceptive faculty.    These original historians did, it is true, find statements and  narratives of other men ready to hand; one person cannot be an  eye-and-ear witness of everything. But, merely as an ingredient, they  make use only of such aids as the poet does of that heritage of an  already-formed language to which he owes so much; historiographers bind  together the fleeting elements of story, and treasure them up for  immortality in the temple of Mnemosyne. Legends, ballad-stories, and  traditions must be excluded from such original history; they are but dim  and hazy forms of historical apprehension, and therefore belong to  nations whose intelligence is but half awakened. Here, on the contrary,  we have to do with people fully conscious of what they were and what  they were about. The domain of reality--actually seen, or capable of  being so-affords a very different basis in point of firmness from that  fugitive and shadowy element in which were engendered those legends and  poetic dreams whose historical prestige vanishes as soon as nations have  attained a mature individuality.    Such original historians, then, change the events, the deeds, and the  states of society with which they are conversant, into an object for the  conceptive faculty; the narratives they leave us cannot, therefore, be  very comprehensive in their range. Herodotus, Thucydides, Guicciardini,  may be taken as fair samples of the class in this respect. What is  present and living in their environment is their proper material. The  influences that have formed the writer are identical with those which  have molded the events that constitute the matter of his story. The  author's spirit and that of the actions he narrates are one and the  same. He describes scenes in which he himself has been an actor, or at  any rate an interested spectator. It is short periods of time,  individual shapes of persons and occurrences, single, unreflected  traits, of which he makes his picture. And his aim is nothing more than  the presentation to posterity of an image of events as clear as that  which he himself possessed in virtue of personal observation, or  lifelike descriptions. Reflections are none of his business, for he  lives in the spirit of his subject; he has not attained an elevation  above it. If, as in Caesar's case, he belongs to the exalted rank of  generals or statesmen, it is the prosecution of his own aims that  constitutes the history.    Such speeches as we find in Thucydides, for example, of which we can  positively assert that they are not _bona fide_ reports, would seem to  make against our statement that a historian of his class presents us no  reflected picture, that persons and people appear in his works in  _propria persona_ ... Granted that such orations as those of  Pericles--that most profoundly accomplished, genuine, noble  statesman--were elaborated by Thucydides, it must yet be maintained that  they were not"]]]
