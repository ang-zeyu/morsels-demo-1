The following vessels were at length contracted for, and assembled in the  River to fit, and take in stores and provisions, _viz_ the _Alexander_,  _Scarborough_, _Charlotte_, _Lady Penrhyn_, and _Friendship_, as  transports; and the _Fishbourn_, _Golden Grove_, and _Borrowdale_, as  store-ships. The _Prince of Wales_ was afterwards added to the number of  transports, on a representation being made to the Treasury Board that  such an addition was necessary. The transports were immediately prepared  for the reception of the convicts, and the store-ships took on board  provisions for two years, with tools, implements of agriculture, and such  other articles as were considered necessary to a colonial establishment.    October.] On the 24th of October, Captain Arthur Phillip hoisted a  pendant on board his Majesty's ship the _Sirius_ of 20 guns, then lying  at Deptford. This ship was originally called the _Berwick_, and intended  for the East India Company; but having, while on the stocks, met with  some accident by fire, was purchased by Government for a store-ship, and  as such had performed one voyage to America. Her burden was about 520  tons; and being, from her construction, well-calculated for this  expedition, she was taken into the service as a man of war, and with her  capacity changed also her name.    As the government of the intended colony, as well as the command of the  _Sirius_, was given to Captain Phillip, it was thought necessary to  appoint another captain to her, who might command her on any service in  which she might be employed for the colony, while Captain Phillip should  be engaged in his government. For this purpose an order was signed by his  Majesty in Council, directing the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to  appoint John Hunter esquire (then a master and commander) second captain  of the Sirius, with the rank of post. Although this ship mounted only 20  guns, and those but six-pounders, yet on this particular service her  establishment was not confined to what is usual in a ship of that class;  but, with a first and second captain, she had also three lieutenants, a  master, purser, surgeon and two mates, a boatswain, a gunner, and a  subaltern's detachment of marines.    The _Supply_ brig was also put into commission, and the command given to  Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball. This vessel was to accompany the Sirius  as an armed tender; and both ships, having completed their equipment at  Deptford-yard, dropped down on the 10th of December to Long Reach, where  they took in their guns, powder, and other stores.    1787.]  January.] They were here joined by some of the transports, and continued  waiting for orders until the 30th of January 1787, when they sailed for  Spithead; which port, however, they were prevented from reaching, by  heavy and contrary gales of wind, which they continued to experience both  in the Downs and on their passage, until the latter end of the following  month.    One or two of the transports had in the mean time arrived at Portsmouth,  and the _Charlotte_ and _Alexander_ proceeded to Plymouth, where they  were to receive the male and female convicts that were ready for them.    March.] On the 5th of March, the order for their embarkation, together  with that of the detachment of marines provided as an escort, was sent  from the Secretary of State's office, with directions for their  immediately joining the other ships of the expedition at the Motherbank.  This was done accordingly; and, every necessary arrangement having taken  place, the troops intended for the garrison embarked, and the convicts,  male and female, were distributed in the different transports.    May.] On Monday the 7th of May Captain Phillip arrived at Portsmouth, and  took the command of his little fleet, then lying at the Motherbank.  Anxious to depart, and apprehensive that the wind, which had for a  considerable time been blowing from the quarter favourable to his passage  down the Channel, might desert him at the moment when he most wished for  its continuance, he on the Thursday following made the signal to prepare  for sailing. But here a demur arose among the sailors on board the  transports, who refused to proceed to sea unless they should be paid  their wages up to the time of their departure, alleging as a ground for  this refusal, that they were in want of many articles necessary for so  long a voyage, which this money, if paid, would enable them to purchase.  The custom of their employ, however, being against a demand which yet  appeared reasonable, Captain Phillip directed the different masters to  put such of their people as refused to proceed with them to sea, on board  of the _Hyaena_ frigate, and to receive an equal number of her seamen,  who should afterwards be re-exchanged at sea, her captain being directed  to accompany the fleet to a certain distance.    This difficulty being removed, and the ship's companies of the _Sirius_  and the _Supply_ having received the usual advance of two months' wages,  on Saturday the 12th the men of war and some of the transports got under  sail, with a view of dropping down to St. Helen's, and thence proceeding  to sea; but the wind falling short, and proving unfavourable, they  brought up at Spithead for the night, and at day-break next morning the  whole fleet weighed with a fresh breeze, and, having a leading wind,  passed without any accident through the Needles.    The transports were of the following tonnage, and had on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#4)"],[1," there, hungry and  forsaken, until they were fetched away.    Josenhans' house was taken by the mortgagee, and the payment the  deceased had made upon it was lost; for the value of houses had  decreased enormously through emigration; many houses in the village  stood empty, and Josenhans' dwelling also remained unoccupied. All the  movable property had been sold, and a small sum had thus been realized  for the children, but it was not nearly enough to pay for their board;  they were consequently parish children, and as such were placed with  those who would take them at the cheapest rate.    One day Amrei announced gleefully to her brother that she knew where  their parents' cuckoo-clock was--Coaly Mathew had bought it. And that  very evening the children stood outside the house and waited for the  cuckoo to sing; and when it did, they laughed aloud.    And every morning the children went to the old house, and knocked, and  played beside the pond, as we saw them doing today. Now they listen, for  they hear a sound that is not often heard at this season of the year--the  cuckoo at Coaly Mathew's is singing eight times.    \"We must go to school,\" said Amrei, and she turned quickly with her  brother through the garden-path back into the village. As they passed  Farmer Rodel's barn, Damie said:    \"They've threshed a great deal at our guardian's today.\" And he pointed  to the bands of threshed sheaves that hung over the half-door of the  barn, as evidence of accomplished work. Amrei nodded silently.          CHAPTER II    THE DISTANT SOUL      Farmer Rodel, whose house with its red beams and its pious text in a  large heart over the door, was not far from Josenhans's had let himself  be appointed guardian of the orphan children by the Village Council. He  made the less objection for the reason that Josenhans had, in former  days, served as second-man on his farm. His guardianship, however, was  practically restricted to his taking care of the father's unsold  clothes, and to his occasionally asking one of the children, as he  passed by: \"Are you good?\"--whereupon he would march off without even  waiting for an answer. Nevertheless a strange feeling of pride came over  the children when they heard that the rich farmer was their guardian,  and they looked upon themselves as very fortunate people, almost  aristocratic. They often stood near the large house and looked up at it  expectantly, as if they were waiting for something and knew not what;  and often, too, they sat by the plows and harrows near the barn and read  the biblical text on the house over and over again. The house seemed to  speak to them, if no one else did.    It was the Sunday before All Souls' Day, and the children were again  playing before the locked house of their parents,--they seemed to love  the spot,--when Farmer Landfried's wife came down the road from  Hochdorf, with a large red umbrella under her arm, and a hymn-book in  her hand. She was paying a final visit to her native place; for the day  before the hired-man had already carried her household furniture out of  the village in a four-horse wagon, and early the next morning she was to  move with her husband and her three children to the farm they had just  bought in distant Allgau. From way up by the mill Dame Landfried was  already nodding to the children--for to meet children on first going out  is, they say, a good sign--but the children could not see her nodding,  nor could they see her sorrowful features. At last, when she drew near  to them, she said:    \"God greet ye, children! What are you doing here so early? To whom do  you belong?\"    \"To Josenhans--there!\" answered Amrei, pointing to the house.    \"Oh, you poor children!\" cried the woman, clasping her hands. \"I should  have known you, my girl, for your mother, when she went to school with  me, looked just as you do--we were good companions; and your father  served my cousin, Farmer Rodel. I know all about you. But tell me,  Amrei, why have you no shoes on? You might take cold in such weather as  this! Tell Marianne that Dame Landfried of Hochdorf told you to say, it  is not right of her to let you run about like this! But no--you needn't  say anything--I will speak to her myself. But, Amrei, you are a big girl  now, and must be sensible and look out for yourself. Just think--what  would your mother say, if she knew that you were running about barefoot  at this season of the year?\"    The child looked at the speaker with wide-open eyes, as if to say:  \"Doesn't my mother know anything about it?\"    But the woman continued:    \"That's the worst of it, that you poor children cannot know what  virtuous parents you had, and therefore older people must tell you.  Remember that you will give real, true happiness to your parents, when  they hear, yonder in heaven, how the people down here on earth are  saying 'The Josenhans children are models of all goodness--one can see  in them the blessing of honest parents.'\"    The tears poured down the woman's cheeks as she spoke these last words.  The feeling of grief in her soul, arising from quite another cause,  burst out irresistibly at these words and thoughts; there was sorrow for  herself mingled with pity for others. She laid her hand upon the head of  the girl, who, when she saw the woman weeping, also began to weep  bitterly; she very likely felt that this was a good soul inclining  toward her, and a dawning consciousness began to steal over her that she  had really lost her parents.    Suddenly the woman's face seemed irradiated. She raised her still  tearful eyes to heaven, and said:    \"Gracious God, Thou givest me the thought.\" Then, turning to the child,  she went on: \"Listen--I will take you with me. My Lisbeth was just your  age when she was taken from me. Tell me, will you go with me to Allgau  and live with me?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Amrei, decidedly.    Then she felt herself nudged and seized from behind. \"You must not!\"  cried Damie, throwing his arms around her--and he was trembling all  over.    \"Be still,\" said Amrei, to soothe him. \"The kind woman will take you  too. Damie is to go with us, is he not?\"    \"No, child, that cannot be--I have boys enough.\"    \"Then I'll not go either,\" said Amrei, and she took Damie by the hand.    There is a kind of shudder, wherein a fever and a chill seem to be  quarreling--the joy of doing something and the fear of doing it. One of  these peculiar shudders passed through the strange woman, and she looked  down upon the child with a certain sense of relief. In a moment of  sympathy, urged on by a pure impulse to do a kind deed, she had proposed  to undertake a task and to assume a responsibility, the significance  and weight of which she had not sufficiently considered; and,  furthermore, she had not taken into account what her husband would think  of her taking such a step without her having spoken to him about it.  Consequently when the child herself refused, a reaction set in, and it  all became clear to her; so that she at once acquiesced, with a certain  sense of relief, in the refusal of her offer. She had obeyed an impulse  of her heart by wishing to do this thing, and now that obstacles stood  in the way, she felt rather glad that it was to be left undone, and  without her having been obliged to retract her promise.    \"As you like,\" said the woman. \"I will not try to persuade you. Who  knows?--perhaps it is better that you should grow up first anyway. To  learn to bear sorrow in youth is a good thing, and we easily get  accustomed to better times; all those who have turned out really well,  were obliged to suffer some heavy crosses in their youth. Only be good,  and keep this in remembrance, that, so long as you are good, and so long  as God grants me life, there shall always be, for your parents' sake, a  shelter for you with me. But now, it's just as well as it is. Wait! I  will give you something to remember me by.\" She felt in her pockets; but  suddenly she put her hand up to her neck and said: \"No, you shall have  this!\" Then she blew on her fingers, which were stiff with the cold,  until they were nimble enough to permit her to unclasp from her neck a  necklace of five rows of garnets, with a Swedish ducat hanging from  them; and she fastened the ornament around the child's neck, kissing her  at the same time.    Amrei watched all this as if spell-bound.    \"For you I unfortunately have nothing,\" said the good woman to Damie,  who was breaking a switch he had in his hand into little pieces. \"But I  will send you a pair of leather breeches belonging to my John--they are  quite good still and you can wear them when you grow bigger. And now,  God keep you, dear children. If possible, I shall come to you again,  Amrei. At any rate, send Marianne to me after church. Be good children,  both of you, and pray heartily for your parents in eternity. And don't  forget that you still have protectors, both in heaven and on earth.\"    The farmer's wife, who, to walk the faster, had tucked her dress up all  around, let it down now that she was at the entrance of the village.  With hurried steps she went along the street, and did not look back  again.    Amrei put her hands up to her neck and bent down her face, wishing to  examine the coin; but she could not quite succeed. Damie was chewing on  the last piece of his switch; when his sister looked at him and saw  tears in his eyes, she said:    \"You shall see--you'll get the finest pair of breeches in the village!\"    \"And I won't take them!\" cried Damie, and he spat out a bit of wood.    \"And I'll tell her that she must buy you a knife too. I shall stay home  all day today--she's coming to see us.\"    \"Yes, if she were only there already,\" replied Damie without knowing  what he said; for a feeling that he had been slighted made him jealous  and reproachful.    The first bell was ringing, and the children hastened back to the  village. Amrei, with a brief explanation, gave the newly-acqu"]]]
