STRONG DRINK.--There is the habit of strong drink. It is only the  lack of self-control that brings men into the depths of degradation;  on account of the cup, the habit of taking drink occasionally in  its milder forms--of playing with a small appetite that only needs  sufficient playing with to make you a demon or a dolt. You think you  are safe; I know you are not safe, if you drink at all; and when you  get offended with the good friends that warn you of your danger,  you are a fool. I know that the grave swallows daily, by scores,  drunkards, every one of whom thought he was safe while he was forming  his appetite. But this is old talk. A young man in this age who forms  the habit of drinking, or puts himself in danger of forming the habit,  is usually so weak that he does not realize the consequences.    [Illustration: LOST SELF-CONTROL.]             *       *       *       *       *    HABIT.      It is almost as difficult to make a man unlearn his Errors as his  Knowledge.--COLTON.    There are habits contracted by bad example, or bad management, before  we have judgment to discern their approaches, or because the eye of  Reason is laid asleep, or has not compass of view sufficient to look  around on every quarter.--TUCKER.      1. HABIT.--Our real strength in life depends upon habits formed in  early life. The young man who sows his wild oats and indulges in the  social cup, is fastening chains upon himself that never can be broken.  The innocent youth by solitary practice of self-abuse will fasten upon  himself a habit which will wreck his physical constitution and bring  suffering and misery and ruin. Young man and young woman, beware of  bad habits formed in early life.    2. A BUNDLE OF HABITS.--Man, it has been said, is a bundle of habits;  and habit is second nature. Metastasio entertained so strong an  opinion as to the power of repetition in act and thought, that he  said, \"All is habit in mankind, even virtue itself.\" Evil habits  must be conquered, or they will conquer us and destroy our peace and  happiness.    3. VICIOUS HABITS.--Vicious habits, when opposed, offer the most  vigorous resistence on the first attack. At each successive encounter  this resistence grows fainter and fainter, until finally it ceases  altogether and the victory is achieved. Habit is man's best friend and  worst enemy; it can exalt him to the highest pinnacle of virtue, honor  and happiness, or sink him to the lowest depths of vice, shame and  misery.    4. HONESTY, OR KNAVERY.--We may form habits of honesty, or knavery;  truth, or falsehood; of industry, or idleness; frugality,  or extravagance; of patience, or impatience; self-denial, or  self-indulgence; of kindness, cruelty, politeness, rudeness, prudence,  perseverance, circumspection. In short, there, is not a virtue, nor a  vice; not an act of body, nor of mind, to which we may not be chained  down by this despotic power.    5. BEGIN WELL.--It is a great point for young men to begin well; for  it is the beginning of life that that system of conduct is adopted  which soon assumes the force of habit. Begin well, and the habit  of doing well will become quite easy, as easy as the habit of doing  badly. Pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent, and  habit will render it the most delightful.             *       *       *       *       *    A GOOD NAME.      1. THE LONGING FOR A GOOD NAME.--The longing for a good name is one  of those laws of nature that were passed for the soul and written down  within to urge toward a life of action, and away from small or wicked  action. So large is this passion that it is set forth in poetic  thought, as having a temple grand as that of Jupiter or Minerva, and  up whose marble steps all noble minds struggle--the temple of Fame.    2. CIVILIZATION.--Civilization is the ocean of which the millions of  individuals are the rivers and torrents. These rivers and torrents  swell with those rains of money and home and fame and happiness,  and then fall and run almost dry, but the ocean of civilization has  gathered up all these waters, and holds them in sparkling beauty  for all subsequent use. Civilization is a fertile delta made by the  drifting souls of men.    3. FAME.--The word \"fame\" never signifies simply notoriety. The  meaning of the direct term may be seen from its negation or opposite,  for only the meanest of men are called infamous. They are utterly  without fame, utterly nameless; but if fame implied only notoriety,  then infamous would possess no marked significance. Fame is an  undertaker that pays but little attention to the living, but who  bedizens the dead, furnishes out their funerals and follows them to  the grave.    4. LIFE-MOTIVE.--So in studying that life-motive which is called a  \"good name,\" we must ask the large human race to tell us the high  merit of this spiritual longing. We must read the words of the sage,  who said long centuries ago that \"a good name was rather chosen than  great riches.\" Other sages have said as much. Solon said that \"He that  will sell his good name will sell the State.\" Socrates said, \"Fame is  the perfume of heroic deeds.\" Our Shakespeare said, \"He lives in fame  who died in virtue's cause.\"    5. INFLUENCES OF OUR AGE.--Our age is deeply influenced by the motives  called property and home and pleasure, but it is a question whether  the generation in action today and the generation on the threshold  of this intense life are conscious fully of the worth of an honorable  name.    6. BEAUTY OF CHARACTER.--We do not know whether with us all a good  name is less sweet than it was with our fathers, but this is painfully  evident that our times do not sufficiently behold the beauty of  character--their sense does not detect quickly enough or love deeply  enough this aroma of heroic deeds.    7. SELLING OUT THEIR REPUTATION.--It is amazing what multitudes there  are who are willing to sell out their reputation, and amazing at what  a low price they will make the painful exchange. Some king remarked  that he would not tell a lie for any reward less than an empire. It  is not uncommon in our world for a man to sell out all his honor and  hopes for a score or a half score of dollars.    8. PRISONS OVERFLOWING.--Our prisons are all full to overflowing of  those who took no thought of honor. They have not waited for an empire  to be offered them before they would violate the sacred rights of man,  but many of them have even murdered for a cause that would not have  justified even an exchange of words.    9. INTEGRITY THE PRIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.--If integrity were made the  pride of the government, the love of it would soon spring up among the  people. If all fraudulent men should go straight to jail, pitilessly,  and if all the most rigid characters were sought out for all political  and commercial offices, there would soon come a popular honesty just  as there has come a love of reading or of art. It is with character as  with any new article--the difficulty lies in its first introduction.    10. A NEW VIRTUE.--May a new virtue come into favor, all our high  rewards, those from the ballot-box, those from employers, the rewards  of society, the rewards of the press, should be offered only to  the worthy. A few years of rewarding the worthy would result in a  wonderful zeal in the young to build up, not physical property, but  mental and spiritual worth.    11. BLESSING THE FAMILY GROUP.--No young man or young woman can by  industry and care reach an eminence in study or art or character,  without blessing the entire family group. We have all seen that the  father and mother feel that all life's care and labor were at last  perfectly rewarded in the success of their child. But had the child  been reckless or indolent, all this domestic joy--the joy of a large  group--would have been blighted forever.    12. AN HONORED CHILD.--There have been triumphs at old Rome, where  victors marched along with many a chariot, many an elephant, and many  spoils of the East; and in all times money has been lavished in the  efforts of States to tell their pleasure in the name of some general;  but more numerous and wide-spread and beyond expression, by chariot  or cannon or drum, have been those triumphal hours, when some son or  daughter has returned to the parental hearth beautiful in the wreaths  of some confessed excellence, bearing a good name.    13. RICH CRIMINALS.--We looked at the utter wretchedness of the men  who threw away reputation, and would rather be rich criminals in exile  than be loved friends and persons at home.    14. AN EMPTY, OR AN EVIL NAME.--Young and old cannot afford to bear  the burden of an empty or an evil name. A good name is a motive of  life. It is a reason for that great encampment we call an existence.  While you are building the home of to-morrow, build up also that kind  of soul that can sleep sweetly on home's pillow, and can feel that God  is not near as an avenger of wrong, but as the Father not only of the  verdure and the seasons, but of you.    [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN DANCER.]             *       *       *       *       *    THE MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.        Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you,    Many a Summer the grass has grown green,    Blossomed and faded, our faces between;    Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,    Long I to-night for your presence again.    --_Elizabeth Akers Allen._        A mother is a mother still,    The holiest thing alive.    --_Coleridge._        There is none,    In all this cold and hollow world, no fount    Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within    A mother's heart.    --_Mrs. Hemans._        And all my mother came into mine eyes,    And gave me up to tears.    --_Shakespeare._      1. HER INFLUENCE.--It is true to nature, although it be expressed in  a figurative form, that a mother is both the morning and the evening"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13468"],[0,"The New Jerusalem (#4)"],[1,"relics  which even the war had never touched at all; I felt the change  as much in the changeless East as in the ever-changing West.  I felt it when I crossed another great square in Paris to look  at a certain statue, which I had last seen hung with crape  and such garlands as we give the dead; but on whose plain  pedestal nothing now is left but the single word \"Strasbourg.\"  I felt it when I saw words merely scribbled with a pencil on a wall  in a poor street in Brindisi; _Italia vittoriosa_.  But I felt it  as much or even more in things infinitely more ancient and remote;  in those monuments like mountains that still seem to look down  upon all modern things.  For these things were more than a trophy  that had been raised, they were a palladium that had been rescued.  These were the things that had again been saved from chaos,  as they were saved at Salamis and Lepanto; and I knew what had  saved them or at least in what formation they had been saved.  I knew that these scattered splendours of antiquity would hardly  have descended to us at all, to be endangered or delivered,  if all that pagan world had not crystallised into Christendom.    Crossing seas as smooth as pavements inlaid with turquoise  and lapis lazuli, and relieved with marble mountains as clear  and famous as marble statues, it was easy to feel all that had  been pure and radiant even in the long evening of paganism;  but that did not make me forget what strong stars had comforted  the inevitable night.  The historical moral was the same whether  these marble outlines were merely \"the isles\" seen afar off like  sunset clouds by the Hebrew prophets, or were felt indeed as Hellas,  the great archipelago of arts and arms praised by the Greek poets;  the historic heritage of both descended only to the Greek Fathers.  In those wild times and places, the thing that preserved both was  the only thing that would have permanently preserved either.  It was but part of the same story when we passed the hoary  hills that held the primeval culture of Crete, and remembered  that it may well have been the first home of the Philistines.  It mattered the less by now whether the pagans were best  represented by Poseidon the deity or by Dagon the demon.  It mattered the less what gods had blessed the Greeks in their youth  and liberty; for I knew what god had blessed them in their despair.  I knew by what sign they had survived the long slavery under  Ottoman orientalism; and upon what name they had called in the darkness,  when there was no light but the horned moon of Mahound.  If the glory of Greece has survived in some sense, I knew why it  had ever survived in any sense.  Nor did this feeling of our fixed  formation fail me when I came to the very gates of Asia and of Africa;  when there rose out of the same blue seas the great harbour of Alexandria;  where had shone the Pharos like the star of Hellas, and where men  had heard from the lips of Hypatia the last words of Plato.  I know the Christians tore Hypatia in pieces; but they did not tear  Plato in pieces.  The wild men that rode behind Omar the Arab would  have thought nothing of tearing every page of Plato in pieces.  For it is the nature of all this outer nomadic anarchy that it is  capable sooner or later of tearing anything and everything in pieces;  it has no instinct of preservation or of the permanent needs of men.  Where it has passed the ruins remain ruins and are not renewed;  where it has been resisted and rolled back, the links of our long  history are never lost.  As I went forward the vision of our  own civilisation, in the form in which it finally found unity,  grew clearer and clearer; nor did I ever know it more certainly  than when I had left it behind.    For the vision was that of a shape appearing and reappearing among  shapeless things; and it was a shape I knew.  The imagination was forced  to rise into altitudes infinitely ancient and dizzy with distance,  as if into the cold colours of primeval dawns, or into the upper  strata and dead spaces of a daylight older than the sun and moon.  But the character of that central clearance still became clearer  and clearer.  And my memory turned again homewards; and I thought it  was like the vision of a man flying from Northolt, over that little  market-place beside my own door; who can see nothing below him  but a waste as of grey forests, and the pale pattern of a cross.        CHAPTER II    THE WAY OF THE DESERT    It may truly be said, touching the type of culture at least,  that Egypt has an Egyptian lower class, a French middle class and an  English governing class.  Anyhow it is true that the civilisations  are stratified in this formation, or superimposed in this order.  It is the first impression produced by the darkness and density  of the bazaars, the line of the lighted cafes and the blaze  of the big hotels.  But it contains a much deeper truth in all  three cases, and especially in the case of the French influence.  It is indeed one of the first examples of what I mean by the divisions  of the West becoming clearer in the ancient centres of the East.  It is often said that we can only appreciate the work of England in a  place like India.  In so far as this is true, it is quite equally true  that we can only appreciate the work of France in a place like Egypt.  But this work is of a peculiar and even paradoxical kind.  It is too practical to be prominent, and so universal that  it is unnoticed.    The French view of the Rights of Man is called visionary;  but in practice it is very solid and even prosaic.  The French have a unique and successful trick by which French  things are not accepted as French.  They are accepted as human.  However many foreigners played football, they would still consider  football an English thing.  But they do not consider fencing  a French thing, though all the terms of it are still French.  If a Frenchman were to label his hostelry an inn or a public house  (probably written publicouse) we should think him a victim of rather  advanced Anglomania.  But when an Englishman calls it an hotel,  we feel no special dread of him either as a dangerous foreigner  or a dangerous lunatic.  We need not recognise less readily  the value of this because our own distinction is different;  especially as our own distinction is being more distinguished.  The spirit of the English is adventure; and it is the essence of adventure  that the adventurer does remain different from the strange tribes  or strange cities, which he studies because of their strangeness.  He does not become like them, as did some of the Germans,  or persuade them to become like him, as do most of the French.  But whether we like or dislike this French capacity, or merely  appreciate it properly in its place, there can be no doubt  about the cause of that capacity.  The cause is in the spirit  that is so often regarded as wildly Utopian and unreal.  The cause is in the abstract creed of equality and citizenship;  in the possession of a political philosophy that appeals to all men.  In truth men have never looked low enough for the success  of the French Revolution.  They have assumed that it claims  to be a sort of divine and distant thing, and therefore have  not noticed it in the nearest and most materialistic things.  They have watched its wavering in the senate and never seen it  walking in the streets; though it can be seen in the streets of Cairo  as in the streets of Paris.    In Cairo a man thinks it English to go into a tea-shop;  but he does not think it French to go into a cafe. And the people  who go to the tea-shop, the English officers and officials,  are stamped as English and also stamped as official.  They are generally genial, they are generally generous, but they  have the detachment of a governing group and even a garrison.  They cannot be mistaken for human beings.  The people going to a cafe  are simply human beings going to it because it is a human place.  They have forgotten how much is French and how much Egyptian  in their civilisation; they simply think of it as civilisation.  Now this character of the older French culture must be grasped because  it is the clue to many things in the mystery of the modern East.  I call it an old culture because as a matter of fact it runs back  to the Roman culture.  In this respect the Gauls really continue  the work of the Romans, in making something official which comes  at last to be regarded as ordinary.  And the great fundamental fact  which is incessantly forgotten and ought to be incessantly remembered,  about these cities and provinces of the near East, is that they  were once as Roman as Gaul.    There is a frivolous and fanciful debate I have often had with a friend,  about whether it is better to find one's way or to lose it, to remember  the road or to forget it.  I am so constituted as to be capable  of losing my way in my own village and almost in my own house.  And I am prepared to maintain the privilege to be a poetic one.  In truth I am prepared to maintain that both attitudes are valuable,  and should exist side by side.  And so my friend and I walk side by side  along the ways of the world, he being full of a rich and humane sentiment,  because he remembers passing that way a few hundred times since  his childhood; while to me existence is a perpetual fairy-tale,  because I have forgotten all about it.  The lamp-post which moves  him to a tear of reminiscence wrings from me a cry of astonishment;  and the wall which to him is as historic as a pyramid is to me  as arresting and revolutionary as a barricade.  Now in this,  I am glad to say, my temperament is very English; and the difference  is very typical of the two functions of the English and the French.  But in practical politics the French have a certain advantage in knowing  where they are, and knowing it is where they have been before.  It is in the Roman Empire.    The position of the English"]]]
