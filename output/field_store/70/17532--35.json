[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#3)"],[1," that be the _casus belli_, the drawn weapon between herself  and Egbert.    What did she want--what did she want? Her mother once said to her, with  that characteristic touch of irony: 'Well, dear, if it is your fate to  consider the lilies, that toil not, neither do they spin, that is one  destiny among many others, and perhaps not so unpleasant as most. Why do  you take it amiss, my child?'    The mother was subtler than her children, they very rarely knew how to  answer her. So Winifred was only more confused. It was not a question of  lilies. At least, if it were a question of lilies, then her children were  the little blossoms. They at least _grew_. Doesn't Jesus say: 'Consider  the lilies _how they grow_.' Good then, she had her growing babies. But  as for that other tall, handsome flower of a father of theirs, he was  full grown already, so she did not want to spend her life considering him  in the flower of his days.    No, it was not that he didn't earn money. It was not that he was idle. He  was _not_ idle. He was always doing something, always working away, down  at Crockham, doing little jobs. But, oh dear, the little jobs--the garden  paths--the gorgeous flowers--the chairs to mend, old chairs to mend!    It was that he stood for nothing. If he had done something  unsuccessfully, and _lost_ what money they had! If he had but striven  with something. Nay, even if he had been wicked, a waster, she would have  been more free. She would have had something to resist, at least. A  waster stands for something, really. He says: 'No, I will not aid and  abet society in this business of increase and hanging together, I will  upset the apple-cart as much as I can, in my small way.' Or else he says:  'No, I will _not_ bother about others. If I have lusts, they are my own,  and I prefer them to other people's virtues.' So, a waster, a scamp,  takes a sort of stand. He exposes himself to opposition and final  castigation: at any rate in story-books.    But Egbert! What are you to do with a man like Egbert? He had no vices.  He was really kind, nay generous. And he was not weak. If he had been  weak Winifred could have been kind to him. But he did not even give her  that consolation. He was not weak, and he did not want her consolation or  her kindness. No, thank you. He was of a fine passionate temper, and of a  rarer steel than she. He knew it, and she knew it. Hence she was only the  more baffled and maddened, poor thing. He, the higher, the finer, in his  way the stronger, played with his garden, and his old folk-songs and  Morris-dances, just played, and let her support the pillars of the future  on her own heart.    And he began to get bitter, and a wicked look began to come on his face.  He did not give in to her; not he. There were seven devils inside his  long, slim, white body. He was healthy, full of restrained life. Yes,  even he himself had to lock up his own vivid life inside himself, now she  would not take it from him. Or rather, now that she only took it  occasionally. For she had to yield at times. She loved him so, she  desired him so, he was so exquisite to her, the fine creature that he  was, finer than herself. Yes, with a groan she had to give in to her own  unquenched passion for him. And he came to her then--ah, terrible, ah,  wonderful, sometimes she wondered how either of them could live after the  terror of the passion that swept between them. It was to her as if pure  lightning, flash after flash, went through every fibre of her, till  extinction came.    But it is the fate of human beings to live on. And it is the fate of  clouds that seem nothing but bits of vapour slowly to pile up, to pile up  and fill the heavens and blacken the sun entirely.    So it was. The love came back, the lightning of passion flashed  tremendously between them. And there was blue sky and gorgeousness for a  little while. And then, as inevitably, as inevitably, slowly the clouds  began to edge up again above the horizon, slowly, slowly to lurk about  the heavens, throwing an occasional cold and hateful shadow: slowly,  slowly to congregate, to fill the empyrean space.    And as the years passed, the lightning cleared the sky more and more  rarely, less and less the blue showed. Gradually the grey lid sank down  upon them, as if it would be permanent.    Why didn't Egbert do something, then? Why didn't he come to grips with  life? Why wasn't he like Winifred's father, a pillar of society, even if  a slender, exquisite column? Why didn't he go into harness of some sort?  Why didn't he take _some_ direction?    Well, you can bring an ass to the water, but you cannot make him drink.  The world was the water and Egbert was the ass. And he wasn't having any.  He couldn't: he just couldn't. Since necessity did not force him to work  for his bread and butter, he would not work for work's sake. You can't  make the columbine flowers nod in January, nor make the cuckoo sing in  England at Christmas. Why? It isn't his season. He doesn't want to. Nay,  he _can't_ want to.    And there it was with Egbert. He couldn't link up with the world's work,  because the basic desire was absent from him. Nay, at the bottom of him  he had an even stronger desire: to hold aloof. To hold aloof. To do  nobody any damage. But to hold aloof. It was not his season.    Perhaps he should not have married and had children. But you can't stop  the waters flowing.    Which held true for Winifred, too. She was not made to endure aloof. Her  family tree was a robust vegetation that had to be stirring and  believing. In one direction or another her life _had_ to go. In her own  home she had known nothing of this diffidence which she found in Egbert,  and which she could not understand, and which threw her into such dismay.  What was she to do, what was she to do, in face of this terrible  diffidence?    It was all so different in her own home. Her father may have had his own  misgivings, but he kept them to himself. Perhaps he had no very profound  belief in this world of ours, this society which we have elaborated with  so much effort, only to find ourselves elaborated to death at last. But  Godfrey Marshall was of tough, rough fibre, not without a vein of  healthy cunning through it all. It was for him a question of winning  through, and leaving the rest to heaven. Without having many illusions  to grace him, he still _did_ believe in heaven. In a dark and  unquestioning way, he had a sort of faith: an acrid faith like the sap of  some not-to-be-exterminated tree. Just a blind acrid faith as sap is  blind and acrid, and yet pushes on in growth and in faith. Perhaps he was  unscrupulous, but only as a striving tree is unscrupulous, pushing its  single way in a jungle of others.    In the end, it is only this robust, sap-like faith which keeps man going.  He may live on for many generations inside the shelter of the social  establishment which he has erected for himself, as pear-trees and currant  bushes would go on bearing fruit for many seasons, inside a walled  garden, even if the race of man were suddenly exterminated. But bit by  bit the wall-fruit-trees would gradually pull down the very walls that  sustained them. Bit by bit every establishment collapses, unless it is  renewed or restored by living hands, all the while.    Egbert could not bring himself to any more of this restoring or renewing  business. He was not aware of the fact: but awareness doesn't help much,  anyhow. He just couldn't. He had the stoic and epicurean quality of his  old, fine breeding. His father-in-law, however, though he was not one bit  more of a fool than Egbert, realized that since we are here we may as  well live. And so he applied himself to his own tiny section of the  social work, and to doing the best for his family, and to leaving the  rest to the ultimate will of heaven. A certain robustness of blood made  him able to go on. But sometimes even from him spurted a sudden gall of  bitterness against the world and its make-up. And yet--he had his own  will-to-succeed, and this carried him through. He refused to ask himself  what the success would amount to. It amounted to the estate down in  Hampshire, and his children lacking for nothing, and himself of some  importance in the world: and _basta!--Basta! Basta!_    Nevertheless do not let us imagine that he was a common pusher. He was  not. He knew as well as Egbert what disillusion meant. Perhaps in his  soul he had the same estimation of success. But he had a certain acrid  courage, and a certain will-to-power. In his own small circle he would  emanate power, the single power of his own blind self. With all his  spoiling of his children, he was still the father of the old English  type. He was too wise to make laws and to domineer in the abstract. But  he had kept, and all honour to him, a certain primitive dominion over the  souls of his children, the old, almost magic prestige of paternity. There  it was, still burning in him, the old smoky torch or paternal godhead.    And in the sacred glare of this torch his children had been brought up.  He had given the girls every liberty, at last. But he had never really  let them go beyond his power. And they, venturing out into the hard white  light of our fatherless world, learned to see with the eyes of the world.  They learned to criticize their father, even, from some effulgence of  worldly white light, to see him as inferior. But this was all very well  in the head. The moment they forgot their tricks of criticism, the old  red glow of his authority came over them again. He was not to be  quenched.    Let the psycho-analyst talk about father complex. It is just a word  invented. Here was a man who had kept alive the old red flame of  fatherhood, fatherhood that had even the right to sacrifice the child to  God, like Isaac. Fatherhood that had life-and-death authority over the  children: a great natural power.

[Illustration]    In 1854 he received a commission from the _Societe d'etudes du Canal de  Suez_ at Paris to negotiate with Saeid Pacha for the construction of the  canal projected in 1816. Accordingly, toward the close of that year, we  again find him on the Isthmus, preparing for his great work. This time  he came to conquer. His mission was crowned with success, and the  necessary concession made in November of that year. A palace and a  retinue of servants were assigned to his use, and he was treated, as  a guest of the Viceroy, with the utmost respect. Great opposition  followed, especially from England; and it was not till January, 1856,  that the second and fuller concession was granted by Saeid Pacha, and a  _Compagnie International_ fully organized.    In 1858 M. Lesseps succeeded in raising two hundred millions of francs  in France, and in 1859 he proceeded to Egypt and planted the Egyptian  flag in the harbor of the ancient Pelusium, the great sea-port of Egypt  thirty centuries ago, where Port Saeid now stands. He laid, at the same  time, the foundation of a lighthouse, and proudly proclaimed the  work commenced. Fresh difficulties--chiefly of a political  nature--interposed, but the indefatigable Lesseps never despaired. In  1859 he had the satisfaction of seeing his company and work placed upon  a firm footing, though the final decision of the French Emperor was not  given till July, 1864. From that time to the present hour the Canal has  steadily progressed toward completion.    The personal appearance of M. de Lesseps is very striking. Though long  past middle age, he has a fresh and even youthful appearance. Both face  and figure are well preserved; his slightly curling gray hair sets off  in pleasing contrast his bronzed yet clear complexion, his bright eye,  and genial smile. He is somewhat over the medium stature, possessed of  a compact and well-knit frame, carries his head erect, and moves about  with a buoyancy and animation perfectly marvelous in one of his years  and experience. His address is that of the well-bred, well-educated  French gentleman that he is. His manner is winning, his voice clear and  under most excellent control, as all those who have listened to his  admirable lectures on the Canal at the late Paris Exposition cannot  fail to remember. What is perhaps most remarkable in a man so bred and  constituted, is that with great gentleness of speech and suavity of  manner he combines a strength of will and fixity of purpose worthy of  Napoleon or Caesar himself. Beneath that calm exterior lay a power which  needed but the stimulus of a great idea to develop.    Though beset by difficulties, laughed at, and maligned, he has never for  a moment swerved from his purpose or relaxed his efforts to accomplish  it. Neither the sneers of Stevenson and his associate engineers, the  heavy broadside of the \"Thunderer,\" or the squibs of _Punch_, ever made  any visible impression on the purpose or action of Lesseps.--\"My purpose  from the commencement was to have confidence,\" said he.    How bravely he has maintained his principle and redeemed his pledge let  the ceremonies which marked the completion and inauguration of his great  work tell--when sea sent greeting to sea; and let the keels of richly  laden argosies from Cathay and from Ind, which plow the waters of the  Canal, declare.           *       *       *       *       *          AN INGENIOUS VENT PEG.      The engraving illustrates an English invention of value in that it  provides a means of giving vent to casks from which liquids are to  be drawn, at the same time excluding the air when the drawing is  discontinued, and thus preventing deterioration in the liquid by undue  exposure to air.    [Illustration]    The principle on which it operates is that of admitting just so much air  as may be required to fill the vacant space produced by the withdrawal  of the liquor from time to time, and affording this air no egress, thus  hermetically sealing the barrel. This is effected by means of a valve  opening inward, at the upper portion of the peg, so long as the density  of the exterior air is in excess of that within. This action takes place  at the very instant of the flow of the liquid, and ceases with it; for  at that instant all further supply is shut off, there being no further  pressure.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LARGE TREES OF TEXAS.--The large court-house of Navarro county is  said to have been covered with shingles made from a single cedar tree.  The oaks, pecans, and cedars of that section of the country attain  an immense size. A pecan tree in Navarro county, on the banks of the  Trinity, measured twenty-three feet in circumference. The cedars are  often more than 100 feet high.           *       *       *       *       *    ELECTRIC MESSAGES.--Although it may require an hour, or two or three  hours, to transmit a telegraphic message to a distant city, yet it  is the mechanical adjustment by the sender and receiver which really  absorbs this time; the actual transit is practically instantaneous,  and so it would be from here to China, so far as the current itself is  concerned.           *       *       *       *       *          A New English Patent Pulley Block.      The following description of a new pulley block, which we take from the  _Ironmonger_, does not give as clear an idea of the invention as could  be desired, but it shows that invention in this field has not yet  exhausted itself:    [Illustration]    \"The block is made on the differential principle. The lifting chain is  passed over two sheaves, each of which is geared internally, the one  having one or more teeth in excess of the other. Revolving around these  internal teeth is a pinion, actuated by an eccentric, which is keyed on  to a shaft passing through the center of the block, with a bearing at  each end in the outside frame of the block. At one end of this shaft  is a wheel with an endless hand chain passing over it; this gives the  motion to the eccentric shaft. The teeth of the internal pinion are  broad enough to gear into the teeth of both the sheaves, but as there is  more teeth in one than in the other, they (the teeth) are not exactly  opposite each other, and therefore will not admit the teeth of the  revolving pinion without moving; but the tooth of the pinion, acting as  a wedge, and entering with great power, pushes the one tooth forward and  the other tooth back; and this continually occurring, a continual rotary  motion is given to the sheaves, in opposite directions, with a power  which is proportioned to the number of the teeth, the throw of  eccentric, and the leverage gained by the diameter of the hand wheel.  The lifting chain is passed over the one sheave, then down, and up over  the other, the two ends being attached to a powerful cross bar, to which  is connected the lifting hook. By this means the weight is distributed  over the two sheaves and the two parts of the chain, increasing the  safety and diminishing the friction of the block.    \"The blocks are very simple in construction, and are not at all liable  to get out of order; the construction being such that the weight cannot  run down, though the men lifting let go the chain. They hang quite plumb  when in action, and the men are able to stand clear away from under the  load, as the hand-wheel chain can be worked at any angle.\"           *       *       *       *       *          Plants In Sleeping Rooms.      The following from the able pen of Dr. J.C. Draper, in the January  number of the _Galaxy_, will answer some inquiries lately received on  the subject, and is a brief, but clear exposition of the injurious  effects of plants in sleeping apartments:    \"Though the air is dependent for the renewal of its oxygen on the action  of the green leaves of plants, it must not be forgotten that it is only  in the presence and under the stimulus of light that these organisms  decompose carbonic acid. All plants, irrespective of their kind or  nature, absorb oxygen and exhale carbonic acid in the dark. The quantity  of noxious gas thus eliminated is, however, exceedingly small when  compared with the oxygen thrown out during the day. When they are  flowering, plants exhale carbonic acid in considerable quantity, and at  the same time evolve heat. In this condition, therefore, they resemble  animals as regards their relation to the air; and a number of plants  placed in a room would, under these circumstances, tend to vitiate the  air.    \"While the phanerogamia, or flowering plants, depend on the air almost  entirely for their supply of carbon, and are busy during the day in  restoring to it the oxygen that has been removed by animals, many of the  inferior cryptogamia, as the fungi and parasitic plants, obtain their  nourishment from material that has already been organized. They do not  absorb carbonic acid, but, on the contrary, they act like animals,  absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbonic acid at all times. It is,  therefore, evident that their presence in a room cannot be productive of  good results.    \"Aside from the highly deleterious action that plants may exert on the  atmosphere of a sleeping room, by increasing the proportion of carbonic  acid during the night, there is another and more important objection to  be urged against their presence in such apartments. Like animals, they  exhale peculiar volatile organic principles, which in many instances  render the air unfit for the purposes of respiration. Even in the days  of Andronicus this fact was recognized, for he says, in speaking of  Arabia Felix, that 'by reason of myrrh, frankincense, and hot spices  there growing, the air was so obnoxious to their brains, that the"]]]
