He chose philosophy, to the chagrin of the Virgin, who  reproached him in mild and sorrowful accents that he had not made a  better choice. She, however, granted his request that he should become  the most excellent philosopher of the age; but set this drawback to his  pleasure, that he should relapse, when at the height of his fame, into  his former incapacity and stupidity. Albertus never took the trouble to  contradict the story, but prosecuted his studies with such unremitting  zeal that his reputation speedily spread over all Europe. In the year  1244, the celebrated Thomas Aquinas placed himself under his tuition.  Many extraordinary stories are told of the master and his pupil. While  they paid all due attention to other branches of science, they never  neglected the pursuit of the philosopher's stone and the elixir vitae.  Although they discovered neither, it was believed that Albert had seized  some portion of the secret of life, and found means to animate a brazen  statue, upon the formation of which, under proper conjunctions of the  planets, he had been occupied many years of his life. He and Thomas  Aquinas completed it together, endowed it with the faculty of speech,  and made it perform the functions of a domestic servant. In this  capacity it was exceedingly useful; but, through some defect in  the machinery, it chattered much more than was agreeable to either  philosopher. Various remedies were tried to cure it of its garrulity,  but in vain; and one day Thomas Aquinas was so enraged at the noise it  made, when he was in the midst of a mathematical problem, that he seized  a ponderous hammer and smashed it to pieces. [Naude, \"Apologie des  Grands Hommes accuses de Magie;\" chap. xviii.] He was sorry afterwards  for what he had done, and was reproved by his master for giving way  to his anger, so unbecoming in a philosopher. They made no attempt to  re-animate the statue.    Such stories as these show the spirit of the age. Every great man who  attempted to study the secrets of nature was thought a magician; and it  is not to be wondered at that, when philosophers themselves pretended to  discover an elixir for conferring immortality, or a red stone which was  to create boundless wealth, that popular opinion should have enhanced  upon their pretensions, and have endowed them with powers still more  miraculous. It was believed of Albertus Magnus that he could even change  the course of the seasons; a feat which the many thought less difficult  than the discovery of the grand elixir. Albertus was desirous of  obtaining a piece of ground on which to build a monastery, in the  neighbourhood of Cologne. The ground belonged to William, Count of  Holland and King of the Romans, who, for some reason or other, did not  wish to part with it. Albertus is reported to have gained it by the  following extraordinary method:--He invited the Prince, as he was  passing through Cologne, to a magnificent entertainment prepared for him  and all his court. The Prince accepted it, and repaired with a lordly  retinue to the residence of the sage. It was in the midst of winter; the  Rhine was frozen over, and the cold was so bitter that the knights could  not sit on horseback without running the risk of losing their toes by  the frost. Great, therefore, was their surprise, on arriving at Albert's  house, to find that the repast was spread in his garden, in which  the snow had drifted to the depth of several feet. The Earl, in high  dudgeon, remounted his steed; but Albert at last prevailed upon him  to take his seat at the table. He had no sooner done so, than the dark  clouds rolled away from the sky--a warm sun shone forth--the cold north  wind veered suddenly round, and blew a mild breeze from the south--the  snows melted away--the ice was unbound upon the streams, and the trees  put forth their green leaves and their fruit--flowers sprang up beneath  their feet, while larks, nightingales, blackbirds, cuckoos, thrushes,  and every sweet song-bird, sang hymns from every tree. The Earl and  his attendants wondered greatly; but they ate their dinner, and in  recompence for it, Albert got his piece of ground to build a convent  on. He had not, however, shown them all his power. Immediately that the  repast was over, he gave the word, and dark clouds obscured the sun--the  snow fell in large flakes--the singing-birds fell dead--the leaves  dropped from the trees, and the winds blew so cold, and howled so  mournfully, that the guests wrapped themselves up in their thick cloaks,  and retreated into the house to warm themselves at the blazing fire in  Albert's kitchen. [Lenglet, \"Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique.\" See  also, Godwin's \"Lives of the Necromancers.\"]    Thomas Aquinas also could work wonders as well as his master. It is  related of him, that he lodged in a street at Cologne, where he was much  annoyed by the incessant clatter made by the horses' hoofs, as they were  led through it daily to exercise by their grooms. He had entreated  the latter to select some other spot where they might not disturb a  philosopher, but the grooms turned a deaf ear to all his solicitations.  In this emergency he had recourse to the aid of magic. He constructed  a small horse of bronze, upon which he inscribed certain cabalistic  characters, and buried it at midnight in the midst of the highway. The  next morning, a troop of grooms came riding along as usual; but the  horses, as they arrived at the spot where the magic horse was  buried, reared and plunged violently--their nostrils distended with  terror--their manes grew erect, and the perspiration ran down their  sides in streams. In vain the riders applied the spur--in vain they  coaxed or threatened, the animals would not pass the spot. On the  following day, their success was no better. They were at length  compelled to seek another spot for their exercise, and Thomas Aquinas  was left in peace. [Naude, \"Apologie des Grands Hommes accuses de  Magie;\" chap. xvii.]    Albertus Magnus was made Bishop of Ratisbon in 1259; but he occupied  the See only four years, when he resigned, on the ground that its  duties occupied too much of the time which he was anxious to devote  to philosophy. He died in Cologne in 1280, at the advanced age of  eighty-seven. The Dominican writers deny that he ever sought the  philosopher's stone, but his treatise upon minerals sufficiently proves  that he did.      ARTEPHIUS.    Artephius, a name noted in the annals of alchymy, was born in the early  part of the twelfth century. He wrote two famous treatises; the one upon  the philosopher's stone, and the other on the art of prolonging human  life. In the latter he vaunts his great qualifications for instructing  mankind on such a matter, as he was at that time in the thousand and  twenty-fifth year of his age! He had many disciples who believed in his  extreme age, and who attempted to prove that he was Apollonius of Tyana,  who lived soon after the advent of Jesus Christ, and the particulars  of whose life and pretended miracles have been so fully described by  Philostratus. He took good care never to contradict a story, which  so much increased the power he was desirous of wielding over his  fellow-mortals. On all convenient occasions, he boasted of it; and  having an excellent memory, a fertile imagination, and a thorough  knowledge of all existing history, he was never at a loss for an answer  when questioned as to the personal appearance, the manners, or the  character of the great men of antiquity. He also pretended to have  found the philosopher's stone; and said that, in search of it, he had  descended to hell, and seen the devil sitting on a throne of gold, with  a legion of imps and fiends around him. His works on alchymy have been  translated into French, and were published in Paris in 1609 or 1610.      ALAIN DE LISLE.    Contemporary with Albertus Magnus was Alain de Lisle, of Flanders,  who was named, from his great learning, the \"universal doctor.\" He was  thought to possess a knowledge of all the sciences, and, like Artephius,  to have discovered the elixir vitae. He became one of the friars of  the abbey of Citeaux, and died in 1298, aged about one hundred and ten  years. It was said of him, that he was at the point of death when in his  fiftieth year; but that the fortunate discovery of the elixir enabled  him to add sixty years to his existence. He wrote a commentary on the  prophecies of Merlin.      ARNOLD DE VILLENEUVE.    This philosopher has left a much greater reputation. He was born in the  year 1245, and studied medicine with great success in the University of  Paris. He afterwards travelled for twenty years in Italy and Germany,  where he made acquaintance with Pietro d'Apone; a man of a character  akin to his own, and addicted to the same pursuits. As a physician, he  was thought, in his own lifetime, to be the most able the world had ever  seen. Like all the learned men of that day, he dabbled in astrology and  alchymy, and was thought to have made immense quantities of gold from  lead and copper. When Pietro d'Apone was arrested in Italy, and brought  to trial as a sorcerer, a similar accusation was made against Arnold;  but he managed to leave the country in time and escape the fate of his  unfortunate friend. He lost some credit by predicting the end of the  world, but afterwards regained it. The time of his death is not exactly  known; but it must have been prior to the year 1311, when Pope Clement  V. wrote a circular letter to all the clergy of Europe who lived under  his obedience, praying them to use their utmost efforts to discover the  famous treatise of Arnold on \"The Practice of Medicine.\" The author had  promised, during his lifetime, to make a present of the work to the Holy  See, but died without fulfilling it.    In a very curious work by Monsieur Longeville Harcouet, entitled \"The  History of the Persons who have lived several "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#3)"],[1,"twelve Disciples. In the Book of Revelation alone the  number 7 is repeated twenty-four times, and the number 12 fourteen  times.        THE TWELVE THOUSAND YEAR CYCLE.    In determining the duration of the period within which were to occur  the events taught in the doctrines of the Exoteric Creed, the ancient  Astrologers dedicated a thousand years to each of the signs of the  Zodiac, and thus inaugurating the cycle of twelve thousand years,  taught that, at its conclusion, the heaven and the earth, which they  believed to be composed of the indestructible elements of fire, air,  earth and water, would, through the agency of the first of these, be  reduced to chaos, as a preliminary to the reorganization of a new  heaven and a new earth at the beginning of the succeeding cycle. Such  was the origin of the grand cycle of the ancient Astrolatry, and it  must be borne in mind that its authors made its conclusion to  correspond in time and circumstance to the doctrines relating to the  finale of the plan of redemption.        THE ANCIENT TRIAD.    After conceiving the idea of a primeval chaos, constituted of four  indestructible elements of which fire was the leading one, the Oriental  astrologers began to indulge in speculations relative to the agencies  which were engaged in its organization. Having no knowledge of the  forces inherent in nature, they imputed this work to three  intelligences, which, embodying the All in All, they personified by the  figure of a man with three heads, and to this trinity gave the names of  Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Such a figure, carved in stone, may be seen in  the island Cave of Elephanta, near Bombay, India, and is popularly  believed to represent the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer; but, in  determining their true signification, we must be governed by the  ancient teachings that \"All things were made by one god-head with three  names, and this God is all things.\" Hence the conclusion is  irresistible that the first person represents neither the creator nor  organizer of chaos, but chaos itself; the second person, its organizer  and governor; and the third person, the agent in nature which impresses  all her parts with life and motion; the latter being the imaginary  great soul or spirit inculcated in the Esoteric philosophy. In support  of this opinion it will be found that the Egyptian Triad of Father, Son  and Spirit is virtually the same we have assigned to its Oriental  prototype. Thus we see that to the ancient Astrolatry Christendom is  indebted for the Trinity of                \"God the Father, God the Son,               God the Spirit--three in one.\"    But, having ascribed supreme intelligence or reason to its second  person, under the name of the Logos, or Word, and designating its third  person as the Holy Ghost, the ancient Triad was usually formulated as  the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost, as may be seen by reference to  the text in the allegories which we find recorded in I John v. 7, which  reads that \"There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the  Word and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.\"    Considered in some forms of Astrolatry as too sacred to attach a name  to the triune Deity, he was called \"the One,\" and we find him thus  designated in the 4th chapter of Revelation, where, like Zeus and  Jupiter, of the Grecian and Roman mythologies, he is represented as  seated above the firmament, upon a throne from which \"proceeded  lightnings and thunderings,\" and to whom all, the subordinate  divinities were made to pay homage. As the hurler of thunderbolts he  was called \"the Thunderer,\" and as the opener of the windows of heaven,  when it rained, he was designated \"Jupiter Pluvius.\" Such was the  ancient Triad made to say of himself, in an inscription found in the  ruins of the temple at Sais in Egypt, \"I am all that has been, all that  is, and all that shall be, and no mortal has lifted yet the veil that  covers me;\" and such was the Triunity referred to as the God Universe  by Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist, who, flourishing in the  first century of the Christian era, wrote that he is \"An infinite God  which has never been created, and which shall never come to an end. To  look for something else beyond it is useless labor for man and out of  his reach. Behold that truly sacred Being, eternal and immense, which  includes within itself everything; it is All in All, or rather itself  is All. It is the work of nature, and itself is nature.\"    Thus we see that, although inculcating homage to a multitude of  subordinate divinities, the ancient Astrolatry was only an apparent  Polytheism; its enlightened votaries, recognizing the dogma of the  unity of God, were in reality Monotheists, paying supreme adoration to  the mythical genius of the Sun, to whom we will now direct attention.        GOD SOL.    In determining the characteristics of the supreme divinity of astral  worship, it must be borne in mind that its founders taught that he was  evolved or engendered by the Father, or first person in the sacred  Triad, from his pure substance, which as we have shown was constituted  of chaos or the primeval fire into which they supposed all things were  reduced through the agency of that element at the conclusion of 12,000  year cycles. Hence, designating that mythical being as the only  begotten of the Father, they personified him as God the Son, or second  person in the sacred Triad; and recognizing the Sun as the ruling star,  very appropriately made him the presiding genius of that luminary,  under the title of God Sol. According homage to light as his chief  attribute, he is referred to in the allegories as \"The true Light,  which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,\" John i., 9; and,  although designated as the only begotten of the Father, his  co-existence with him, under the title of the Logos or Word, is shown  in the text which reads, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word  was with God, and the Word was God,\" John i., 1.    Personifying the principles of Good and Evil in God Sol, the ancient  Astrologers consecrated the six divisions of the 12,000 year cycle,  corresponding to the reproductive months of Spring and Summer, to him  as Lord of Good, and symbolizing him by the constellation of the Zodiac  in which the Vernal Equinox successively occurred, as explained  hereafter, they dedicated the six divisions of that cycle,  corresponding to the destructive months of Autumn and Winter, to him as  Lord of Evil, and as such, symbolizing him by the serpent, marked the  beginning of his reign by the constellation \"Serpens,\" placed in  conjunction with the Autumnal Equinox. Personifying in him the opposing  principles of Good and Evil, he was to the ancients both God and Devil,  or the varied God, who, in relation to the seasons, was described as  beautiful in Spring, powerful in Summer, beneficent in Autumn and  terrible in Winter. Thus under various names, intended to represent God  Sol in relation to the diversified seasons, we find recorded in the  Scriptures, or solar fables, numerous portrayals of imaginary  conflicts, in which the Evil principle, triumphing during Autumn and  Winter, is conquered at the Vernal Equinox by the Good principle, who,  bringing back equal days and nights, restores the harmony of nature.    The eternal enmity between the principles of Good and Evil, as  manifested in the diversity of the seasons, we find portrayed in the  Constellations Hercules and Draco, placed in the northern heavens, in  which the heel of the former, representing one of the most ancient of  the imaginary incarnations of God Sol, to which we will refer  hereafter, is resting upon the head of the latter, as referred to in  Genesis iii., 15, which makes God Sol, or the Lord God, say to the  serpent, \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy  seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his  heel.\" The woman alluded to in this text is the Virgo of the Zodiac, as  will be made apparent hereafter.    [See plate2.gif]    Of all the divinities of the ancient mythology God Sol was the only one  distinguished by the exalted title of Lord or Lord God, for the reason  that he was made the organizer of chaos and governor of heaven and  earth. Hence, having constituted him the lord of light and darkness, as  well as good and evil, the ancient astrologers in composing the solar  fables made him say of himself, \"I form the light and create darkness;  I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things,\" Isaiah  xlv., 7. \"Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done  it?\" Amos iii., 6. Besides the title of Lord or Lord God, the solar  divinity is also designated in the allegories as the Lord of Lords and  the King of Kings, the Invincible, the Mighty God, etc.    Subjecting the mythical genius of the sun, in his apparent annual  revolution round the earth, to the four stages of human life from  infancy to old age, the ancient Magi fixed the natal day of the young  God Sol at the winter solstice, the Virgo of the Zodiac was made his  mother, and the constellation in conjunction with her, which is now  known as Bootes, but anciently called Arcturus, his foster father. He  is represented as holding in leash two hunting dogs and driving Ursa  Major, or the Great Bear, around the north pole, thus showing that the  original occupation of the celestial foster father of the young God Sol  was that of a bear driver, and that his sons, referred to in job  xxxviii., 32, are the dogs Asterion and Chara. It will be observed that  Virgo is represented in our illustration with a child in her arms, for  the reason that she is so represented in the ancient Zodiacs, and the  fact will be readily conceded that she is the only Virgin who could  give birth to a child and be a virgin still.
