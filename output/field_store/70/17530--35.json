In such marshy ground as  the Skunk Cabbage lives in, many small flies and gnats live in embryo  under the fallen leaves during the winter. But even before they are  warmed into active life, the hive-bees, natives of Europe, and with  habits not perfectly adapted as yet to our flora, are out after pollen.    After the flowering time come the vivid green crowns of leaves that at  least please the eye. Lizards make their home beneath them, and many a  yellowthroat, taking advantage of the plant's foul odor, gladly puts up  with it herself and builds her nest in the hollow of the cabbage as a  protection for her eggs and young from four-footed enemies. Cattle let  the plant alone because of the stinging acrid juices secreted by it,  although such tender, fresh, bright foliage must be especially tempting,  like the hellebore's, after a dry winter diet. Sometimes tiny insects  are found drowned in the wells of rain water that accumulate at the base  of the grooved leafstalks.          SPIDERWORT FAMILY _(Commelinaceae)_      Virginia, or Common Day-flower    _Commelina virginica_    _Flowers_--Blue, 1 in. broad or less, irregular, grouped at end of stem,  and upheld by long leaf-like bracts. Calyx of 3 unequal sepals; 3  petals, 1 inconspicuous, 2 showy, rounded. Perfect stamens 3; the anther  of 1 incurved stamen largest; 3 insignificant and sterile stamens; 1  pistil. _Stem:_ Fleshy, smooth, branched, mucilaginous. _Leaves:_  Lance-shaped, 3 to 5 in. long, sheathing the stem at base; upper leaves  in a spathe-like bract folding like a hood about flowers. _Fruit:_ A  3-celled capsule, 1 seed in each cell.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist, shady ground.    _Flowering Season_--June-September.    _Distribution_--\"Southern New York to Illinois and Michigan, Nebraska,  Texas, and through tropical America to Paraguay.\"--Britton and Browne.    Delightful Linnaeus, who dearly loved his little joke, himself confesses  to have named the day-flowers after three brothers Commelyn, Dutch  botanists, because two of them--commemorated in the two showy blue  petals of the blossom--published their works; the third, lacking  application and ambition, amounted to nothing, like the inconspicuous  whitish third petal! Happily Kaspar Commelyn died in 1731, before the  joke was perpetrated in \"Species Plantarum.\" Soon after noon, the  day-flower's petals roll up, never to open again.          PICKEREL-WEED FAMILY _(Pontederiaceae)_      Pickerel Weed    _Pontederia cordata_    _Flowers_--Bright purplish blue, including filaments, anthers, and  style; crowded in a dense spike; quickly fading; unpleasantly odorous.  Perianth tubular, 2-lipped, parted into 6 irregular lobes, free from  ovary; middle lobe of upper lip with 2 yellow spots at base within.  Stamens 6, placed at unequal distances on tube, 3 opposite each lip.  Pistil 1, the stigma minutely toothed. _Stem_: Erect, stout, fleshy, 1  to 4 ft. tall, not often over 2 ft. above water line. _Leaves_: Several  bract-like, sheathing stem at base; 1 leaf only, midway on flower-stalk,  thick, polished, triangular, or arrow-shaped, 4 to 8 in. long, 2 to 6  in. across base.    _Preferred Habitat_--Shallow water of ponds and streams.    _Flowering Season_--June-October.    _Distribution_--Eastern half of United States and Canada.    Grace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of ragged  flowers above rich, glossy leaves give a charm to this vigorous wader.  Backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay their eggs among the  leaves; but so they do among the sedges, arums, wild rice, and various  aquatic plants, like many another fish. Bees and flies, that congregate  about the blossoms to feed, may sometimes fly too low, and so give a  plausible reason for the pickerel's choice of haunt. Each blossom lasts  but a single day; the upper portion, withering, leaves the base of the  perianth to harden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed. But as  the gradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession of  bloom for months, more than ample provision is made for the perpetuation  of the race--a necessity to any plant that refuses to thrive unless it  stands in water. Ponds and streams have an unpleasant habit of drying up  in summer, and often the Pickerel Weed looks as brown as a bullrush  where it is stranded in the baked mud in August. When seed falls on such  ground, if indeed it germinates at all, the young plant naturally  withers away.    Of the three kinds of blossoms, one raises its stigma on a long style  reaching to the top of the flower; a second form reaches its stigma only  half-way up, and the third keeps its stigma in the bottom of the tube.  The visiting bee gets his abdomen, his chest, and his tongue dusted with  pollen from long, middle-length, and short stamens respectively. When he  visits another flower, these parts of his body coming in contact with  the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where the stamens were in  other individuals, he brushes off each lot of pollen just where it will  do the most good.          LILY FAMILY _(Liliaceae)_      American White Hellebore; Indian Poke; Itch-weed    _Veratrum viride_    _Flowers_--Dingy, pale yellowish or whitish green, growing greener with  age, 1 in. or less across, very numerous, in stiff-branching,  spike-like, dense-flowered panicles. Perianth of 6 oblong segments; 6  short curved stamens; 3 styles. _Stem:_ Stout, leafy, 2 to 8 ft. tall.  _Leaves:_ Plaited, lower ones broadly oval, pointed, 6 to 12 in. long;  parallel ribbed, sheathing the stem where they clasp it; upper leaves  gradually narrowing; those among flowers small.    _Preferred Habitat_--Swamps, wet woods, low meadows.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--British Possessions from ocean to ocean; southward in  the United States to Georgia, Tennessee, and Minnesota.      \"Borage and hellebore fill two scenes--    Sovereign plants to purge the veins    Of melancholy, and cheer the heart    Of those black fumes which make it smart.\"    Such are the antidotes for madness prescribed by Burton in his \"Anatomie  of Melancholy.\" But like most medicines, so the homoeopaths have taught  us, the plant that heals may also poison; and the coarse, thick  rootstock of this hellebore sometimes does deadly work. The shining  plaited leaves, put forth so early in the spring they are especially  tempting to grazing cattle on that account, are too well known by most  animals, however, to be touched by them--precisely the end desired, of  course, by the hellebore, nightshade, aconite, cyclamen, Jamestown weed,  and a host of others that resort, for protection, to the low trick of  mixing poisonous chemicals with their cellular juices. Pliny told how  the horses, oxen, and swine of his day were killed by eating the foliage  of the black hellebore. But the flies which cross-fertilize this plant  seem to be uninjured by its nectar.      Wild Yellow, Meadow, or Field Lily; Canada Lily    _Lilium canadense_    _Flowers_--Yellow to orange-red, of a deeper shade within, and speckled  with dark, reddish-brown dots. One or several (rarely many) nodding on  long peduncles from the summit. Perianth bell-shaped, of 6 spreading  segments 2 to 3 in. long, their tips curved backward to the middle; 6  stamens, with reddish-brown linear anthers; 1 pistil, club-shaped; the  stigma 3-lobed. _Stem_: 2 to 5 ft. tall, leafy, from a bulbous rootstock  composed of numerous fleshy white scales. _Leaves_: Lance-shaped to  oblong; usually in whorls of fours to tens, or some alternate. _Fruit_:  An erect, oblong, 3-celled capsule, the flat, horizontal seeds packed in  2 rows in each cavity.    _Preferred Habitat_--Swamps, low meadows, moist fields.    _Flowering Season_--June-July.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Georgia, westward beyond the Mississippi.    Not our gorgeous lilies that brighten the low-lying meadows in early  summer with pendent, swaying bells; possibly not a true lily at all was  chosen to illustrate the truth which those who listened to the Sermon on  the Mount, and we, equally anxious, foolishly overburdened folk of  to-day, so little comprehend.    \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither  do they spin:    \"And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not  arrayed like one of these.\"    Opinions differ as to the lily of Scripture. Eastern peoples use the  same word interchangeably for the tulip, anemone, ranunculus, iris, the  water-lilies, and those of the field. The superb scarlet Martagon Lily  _(L. chalcedonicum)_, grown in gardens here, is not uncommon wild in  Palestine; but whoever has seen the large anemones there \"carpeting  every plain and luxuriantly pervading the land\" is inclined to believe  that Jesus, who always chose the most familiar objects in the daily life  of His simple listeners to illustrate His teachings, rested His eyes on  the slopes about Him glowing with anemones in all their matchless  loveliness. What flower served Him then matters not at all. It is enough  that scientists--now more plainly than ever before--see the universal  application of the illustration the more deeply they study nature, and  can include their \"little brothers of the air\" and the humblest flower  at their feet when they say with Paul, \"In God we live and move and have  our being.\"    Tallest and most prolific of bloom among our native lilies, as it is the  most variable in color, size, and form, the Turk's Cap, or Turban Lily  _(L. superbum)_, sometimes nearly merges its identity into its Canadian  sister's. Travellers by rail between New York and Boston know how  gorgeous are the low meadows and marshes in July or August, when its  clusters of deep yellow, orange, or flame-colored lilies tower above the  surrounding vegetation.

Volume 1 (#3)"],[1,"his nakedness--to shelter himself from  the inclemencies of the weather, first with artlessly constructed huts,  and the skins of the beasts of the forest; by degrees he mends their  appearance, renders them more convenient: he establishes manufactories  to supply his immediate wants; he digs clay, gold, and other fossils  from the bowels of the earth; converts them into bricks for his house,  into vessels for his use, gradually improves their shape, and augments  their beauty. To a being exalted above our terrestrial globe, man would  not appear less subjected to the laws of Nature when naked in the forest  painfully seeking his sustenance, than when living in civilized society  surrounded with ease, or enriched with greater experience, plunged in  luxury, where he every day invents a thousand new wants and discovers  a thousand new modes of supplying them. All the steps taken by man to  regulate his existence, ought only to be considered as a long succession  of causes and effects, which are nothing more than the development of  the first impulse given him by nature.    The same animal, by virtue of his organization, passes successively from  the most simple to the most complicated wants; it is nevertheless the  consequence of his nature. The butterfly whose beauty we admire, whose  colours are so rich, whose appearance is so brilliant, commences as  an inanimate unattractive egg; from this, heat produces a worm, this  becomes a chrysalis, then changes into that beautiful insect adorned  with the most vivid tints: arrived at this stage he reproduces,  he generates; at last despoiled of his ornaments, he is obliged to  disappear, having fulfilled the task imposed on him by Nature, having  performed the circle of transformation marked out for beings of his  order.    The same course, the same change takes place in the vegetable world. It  is by a series of combinations originally interwoven with the energies  of the aloe, that this plant is insensibly regulated, gradually  expanded, and at the end of a number of years produces those flowers  which announce its dissolution.    It is equally so with man, who in all his motion, all the changes  he undergoes, never acts but according to the laws peculiar to his  organization, and to the matter of which he is composed.    The _physical man_, is he who acts by the causes our faculties make us  understand.    The _moral man_, is he who acts by physical causes, with which our  prejudices preclude us from becoming perfectly acquainted.    The _wild man_ is a child destitute of experience, incapable of  proceeding in his happiness, because he has not learnt how to oppose  resistance to the impulses he receives from those beings by whom he is  surrounded.    The _civilized man_, is he whom experience and sociality have enabled to  draw from nature the means of his own happiness, because he has learned  to oppose resistance to those impulses he receives from exterior beings,  when experience has taught him they would be destructive to his welfare.    The _enlightened man_ is man in his maturity, in his perfection; who  is capable of advancing his own felicity, because he has learned to  examine, to think for himself, and not to take that for truth upon  the authority of others, which experience has taught him a critical  disquisition will frequently prove erroneous.    The _happy man_ is he who knows how to enjoy the benefits bestowed  upon him by nature: in other words, he who thinks for himself; who is  thankful for the good he possesses; who does not envy the welfare of  others, nor sigh after imaginary benefits always beyond his grasp.    The _unhappy man_ is he who is incapacitated to enjoy the benefits of  nature; that is, he who suffers others to think for him; who neglects  the absolute good he possesses, in a fruitless search after ideal  benefits; who vainly sighs after that which ever eludes his pursuit.    It necessarily results, that man in his enquiry ought always to  contemplate experience, and natural philosophy: These are what he should  consult in his religion,--in his morals,--in his legislation,--in  his political government,--in the arts,--in the sciences,--in his  pleasures,--above all, in his misfortunes. Experience teaches that  Nature acts by simple, regular, and invariable laws. It is by his  senses, man is bound to this universal Nature; it is by his perception  he must penetrate her secrets; it is from his senses he must draw  experience of her laws. Therefore, whenever he neglects to acquire  experience or quits its path, he stumbles into an abyss; his imagination  leads him astray.    All the errors of man are physical: he never deceives himself but when  he neglects to return back to nature, to consult her laws, to call  practical knowledge to his aid. It is for want of practical knowledge  he forms such imperfect ideas of matter, of its properties, of its  combinations, of its power, of its mode of action, and of the energies  which spring from its essence. Wanting this experience, the whole  universe, to him, is but one vast scene of error. The most ordinary  results appear to him the most astonishing phenomena; he wonders at  every thing, understands nothing, and yields the guidance of his actions  to those interested in betraying his interests. He is ignorant of  Nature, and he has mistaken her laws; he has not contemplated the  necessary routine which she has marked out for every thing she holds.  Mistaken the laws of Nature, did I say? He has mistaken himself: the  consequence is, that all his systems, all his conjectures, all his  reasonings, from which he has banished experience, are nothing more than  a tissue of errors, a long chain of inconsistencies.    Error is always prejudicial to man: it is by deceiving himself, the  human race is plunged into misery. He neglected Nature; he did not  comprehend her laws; he formed gods of the most preposterous and  ridiculous kinds: these became the sole objects of his hope, and the  creatures of his fear: he was unhappy, he trembled under these visionary  deities; under the supposed influence of visionary beings created by  himself; under the terror inspired by blocks of stone; by logs of  wood; by flying fish; or the frowns of men, mortal as himself, whom  his disturbed fancy had elevated above that Nature of which alone he  is capable of forming any idea. His very posterity laughs at his folly,  because experience has convinced them of the absurdity of his groundless  fears--of his misplaced worship. Thus has passed away the ancient  mythology, with all the trifling and nonsensical attributes attached to  it by ignorance.    Not understanding that Nature, equal in her distributions, entirely  destitute of malice, follows only necessary and immutable laws, when  she either produces beings or destroys them, when she causes those to  suffer, whose construction creates sensibility; when she scatters among  them good and evil; when she subjects them to incessant change--he did  not perceive it was in the breast of Nature herself, that it was in her  exuberance he ought to seek to satisfy his deficiencies; for remedies  against his pains; for the means of rendering himself happy: he expected  to derive these benefits from fantastic beings, whom he supposed to  be above Nature; whom he mistakingly imagined to be the authors of his  pleasures, and the cause of his misfortunes. From hence it appears that  to his ignorance of Nature, man owes the creation of those illusive  powers; under which he has so long trembled with fear; that  superstitious worship, which has been the source of all his misery, and  the evils entailed upon posterity.    For want of clearly comprehending his own peculiar nature, his proper  course, his wants, and his rights, man has fallen in society, from  FREEDOM into SLAVERY. He had forgotten the purpose of his existence, or  else he believed himself obliged to suppress the natural desires of his  heart, to sacrifice his welfare to the caprice of chiefs, either elected  by himself, or submitted to without examination. He was ignorant of the  true policy of association--of the object of government; he disdained to  listen to the voice of Nature, which loudly proclaimed the price of all  submission to be protection and happiness: the end of all government  is the benefit of the governed, not the exclusive advantage of the  governors. He gave himself up without enquiry to men like himself, whom  his prejudices induced him to contemplate as beings of a superior order,  as Gods upon earth, they profited by his ignorance, took advantage of  his prejudices, corrupted him, rendered him vicious, enslaved him, and  made him miserable. Thus man, intended by Nature for the full enjoyment  of liberty, to patiently search out her laws, to investigate her  secrets, to cling to his experience; has, from a neglect of her salutary  admonitions, from an inexcusable ignorance of his own peculiar essence,  fallen into servility: has been wickedly governed.    Having mistaken himself, he has remained ignorant of the indispensable  affinity that subsists between him, and the beings of his own species:  having mistaken his duty to himself, it consequently follows, he has  mistaken his duty to others. He made a calculation in error of what his  happiness required; he did not perceive, what he owed to himself, the  excesses he ought to avoid, the desires he ought to resist, the impulses  he ought to follow, in order to consolidate his felicity, to promote his  comfort, and to further his advantage. In short, he was ignorant of his  true interests; hence his irregularities, his excesses, his shameful  extravagance, with that long train of vices, to which he has abandoned  himself, at the expense of his preservation, at the hazard of his  permanent prosperity.    It is, therefore, ignorance of himself that has hindered man from  enlightening his morals. The corrupt authorities to which he had"]]]
