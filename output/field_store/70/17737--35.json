Some of us got some fence rails and piled them  together and worried through the night as best we could.  The next  morning we were ordered to march again, but we soon began to get hungry,  and we had about half halted and about not halted at all.  Some of the  boys were picking blackberries.  The main body of the regiment was  marching leisurely along the road, when bang, debang, debang, bang,  and a volley of buck and ball came hurling right through the two advance  companies of the regiment--companies H and K.  We had marched into a  Yankee ambuscade.    All at once everything was a scene of consternation and confusion;  no one seemed equal to the emergency.  We did not know whether to run or  stand, when Captain Field gave the command to fire and charge the bushes.  We charged the bushes and saw the Yankees running through them, and we  fired on them as they retreated.  I do not know how many Yankees were  killed, if any.  Our company (H) had one man killed, Pat Hanley, an  Irishman, who had joined our company at Chattanooga.  Hugh Padgett and  Dr. Hooper, and perhaps one or two others, were wounded.    After the fighting was over, where, O where, was all the fine rigging  heretofore on our officers?  They could not be seen.  Corporals,  sergeants, lieutenants, captains, all had torn all the fine lace off  their clothing.  I noticed that at the time and was surprised and hurt.  I asked several of them why they had torn off the insignia of their rank,  and they always answered, \"Humph, you think that I was going to be a  target for the Yankees to shoot at?\"  You see, this was our first battle,  and the officers had not found out that minnie as well as cannon balls  were blind; that they had no eyes and could not see.  They thought that  the balls would hunt for them and not hurt the privates.  I always shot  at privates.  It was they that did the shooting and killing, and if I  could kill or wound a private, why, my chances were so much the better.  I always looked upon officers as harmless personages.  Colonel Field,  I suppose, was about the only Colonel of the war that did as much  shooting as the private soldier.  If I shot at an officer, it was at long  range, but when we got down to close quarters I always tried to kill  those that were trying to kill me.      SEWELL MOUNTAIN    From Cheat Mountain we went by forced marches day and night, over hill  and everlasting mountains, and through lovely and smiling valleys,  sometimes the country rich and productive, sometimes rough and broken,  through towns and villages, the names of which I have forgotten, crossing  streams and rivers, but continuing our never ceasing, unending march,  passing through the Kanawha Valley and by the salt-works, and nearly back  to the Ohio river, when we at last reached Sewell Mountain.  Here we  found General John B. Floyd strongly entrenched and fortified and facing  the advance of the Federal army.  Two days before our arrival he had  charged and captured one line of the enemy's works.  I know nothing of  the battle.  See the histories for that.  I only write from memory,  and that was twenty years ago, but I remember reading in the newspapers  at that time of some distinguished man, whether he was captain, colonel  or general, I have forgotten, but I know the papers said \"he sought the  bauble, reputation, at the cannon's mouth, and went to glory from the  death-bed of fame.\"  I remember it sounded gloriously in print.  Now,  reader, this is all I know of this grand battle.  I only recollect what  the newspapers said about it, and you know that a newspaper always tells  the truth.  I also know that beef livers sold for one dollar apiece in  gold; and here is where we were first paid off in Confederate money.  Remaining here a few days, we commenced our march again.    Sewell Mountain, Harrisonburg, Lewisburg, Kanawha Salt-works, first four,  forward and back, seemed to be the programme of that day.  Rosecrans,  that wiley old fox, kept Lee and Jackson both busy trying to catch him,  but Rosey would not be caught.  March, march, march; tramp, tramp, tramp,  back through the valley to Huntersville and Warm Springs, and up through  the most beautiful valley--the Shenandoah--in the world, passing towns  and elegant farms and beautiful residences, rich pastures and abundant  harvests, which a Federal General (Fighting Joe Hooker), later in the war,  ordered to be so sacked and destroyed that a \"crow passing over this  valley would have to carry his rations.\"  Passing on, we arrived at  Winchester.  The first night we arrived at this place, the wind blew a  perfect hurricane, and every tent and marquee in Lee's and Jackson's army  was blown down.  This is the first sight we had of Stonewall Jackson,  riding upon his old sorrel horse, his feet drawn up as if his stirrups  were much too short for him, and his old dingy military cap hanging well  forward over his head, and his nose erected in the air, his old rusty  sabre rattling by his side.  This is the way the grand old hero of a  hundred battles looked.  His spirit is yonder with the blessed ones that  have gone before, but his history is one that the country will ever be  proud of, and his memory will be cherished and loved by the old soldiers  who followed him through the war.      ROMNEY    Our march to and from Romney was in midwinter in the month of January,  1862.  It was the coldest winter known to the oldest inhabitant of these  regions.  Situated in the most mountainous country in Virginia, and away  up near the Maryland and Pennsylvania line, the storm king seemed to rule  in all of his majesty and power.  Snow and rain and sleet and tempest  seemed to ride and laugh and shriek and howl and moan and groan in  all their fury and wrath.  The soldiers on this march got very much  discouraged and disheartened.  As they marched along icicles hung from  their clothing, guns, and knapsacks; many were badly frost bitten,  and I heard of many freezing to death along the road side.  My feet  peeled off like a peeled onion on that march, and I have not recovered  from its effects to this day.  The snow and ice on the ground being  packed by the soldiers tramping, the horses hitched to the artillery  wagons were continually slipping and sliding and falling and wounding  themselves and sometimes killing their riders.  The wind whistling with  a keen and piercing shriek, seemed as if they would freeze the marrow  in our bones.  The soldiers in the whole army got rebellious--almost  mutinous--and would curse and abuse Stonewall Jackson; in fact, they  called him \"Fool Tom Jackson.\"  They blamed him for the cold weather;  they blamed him for everything, and when he would ride by a regiment they  would take occasion, _sotto voce_, to abuse him, and call him \"Fool Tom  Jackson,\" and loud enough for him to hear.  Soldiers from all commands  would fall out of ranks and stop by the road side and swear that they  would not follow such a leader any longer.    When Jackson got to Romney, and was ready to strike Banks and Meade in a  vital point, and which would have changed, perhaps, the destiny of the  war and the South, his troops refused to march any further, and he turned,  marched back to Winchester and tendered his resignation to the  authorities at Richmond.  But the great leader's resignation was not  accepted.  It was in store for him to do some of the hardest fighting  and greatest generalship that was done during the war.    One night at this place (Romney), I was sent forward with two other  soldiers across the wire bridge as picket.  One of them was named  Schwartz and the other Pfifer--he called it Fifer, but spelled it with a  P--both full-blooded Dutchmen, and belonging to Company E, or the German  Yagers, Captain Harsh, or, as he was more generally called, \"God-for-dam.\"    When we had crossed the bridge and taken our station for the night,  I saw another snow storm was coming.  The zig-zag lightnings began to  flare and flash, and sheet after sheet of wild flames seemed to burst  right over our heads and were hissing around us.  The very elements  seemed to be one aurora borealis with continued lightning.  Streak after  streak of lightning seemed to be piercing each the other, the one from  the north and the other from the south.  The white clouds would roll up,  looking like huge snow balls, encircled with living fires.  The earth and  hills and trees were covered with snow, and the lightnings seemed to be  playing \"King, King Canico\" along its crusted surface.  If it thundered  at all, it seemed to be between a groaning and a rumbling sound.  The  trees and hills seemed white with livid fire.  I can remember that storm  now as the grandest picture that has ever made any impression on my  memory.  As soon as it quit lightning, the most blinding snow storm fell  that I ever saw.  It fell so thick and fast that I got hot.  I felt like  pulling off my coat.  I was freezing.  The winds sounded like sweet  music.  I felt grand, glorious, peculiar; beautiful things began to play  and dance around my head, and I supposed I must have dropped to sleep or  something, when I felt Schwartz grab me, and give me a shake, and at the  same time raised his gun and fired, and yelled out at the top of his  voice, \"Here is your mule.\"  The next instant a volley of minnie balls  was scattering the snow all around us.  I tried to walk, but my pants and  boots were stiff and frozen, and the blood had ceased to circulate in my  lower limbs.  But Schwartz kept on firing, and at every fire he would  yell out, \"Yer is yer mool!\"  Pfifer could not speak English, and I  reckon he said \"Here is your mule\" in Dutch.  About the same time we were  hailed from three Confederate officers, at full gallop right toward us,  not to shoot.  And as they galloped up to us and thundered right across  the bridge, we discovered it was Stonewall Jackson and two of his staff."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13213"],[0,"The Night Before Christmas and Other Popular Stories For Children (#4)"],[1,"and maybe we'll catch Santa Claus before he rides off.\"    Hand in hand they tiptoed to the dining-room and peeped out the big  window;--surely, surely, that was something climbing up the roof of  cousin Nellie's house; it must be old Santa. Fred gave a chuckle of  delight; to be sure the reindeer were very queer looking objects, and  the sleigh such a funny shape, but the children were satisfied.    The old fir tree, whose high branches almost touched the roof,  knew all about those shadows, but it was so old no one could ever  understand a word of the many tales it told.    \"There's something scratching on the door,\" whispered Jessie; but  it was only a mouse, who had sniffed the delightful odors of the  Christmas goodies and was trying his best to find a way into the  pantry and test them with his sharp teeth.    \"Come,\" said Jessie, \"we'll turn to icicles if we stay here much,  longer\"; so up-stairs they quickly scampered.    Papa had been to town on an errand, so it was quite late when he came  home. As he was hunting in his pockets for his key, he heard a pitiful  cry, and looking down he saw a big, white cat carrying a tiny kitten  in her mouth.    \"Poor thing,\" said papa, \"you shall come inside till morning.\"    Santa Claus had been there with the nicest wagon for Fred and a warm,  seal-skin cap that lay right in the middle of it. When papa left the  room, puss and her kitty were curled up comfortably on the rug singing  their sleepy song.    The sun was shining brightly in the dining-room window when Jessie and  Fred made their appearance; then Fred just laughed with delight, for  right in the crown of his new cap lay the cutest white kitten, with  big, blue eyes and wee pink nose, while standins close by as if to  guard her darling from danger, was good old mother puss.    \"I never had a live Christmas present before,\" said Fred, \"now I know  Santa Claus read the letter I threw up the chimney because I told him  to bring me a kitten and here it is.\"    Papa smiled and looked at mamma, and then everybody said \"Merry  Christmas\" at once.    OLIVER HERFOLD.          SUSY'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT.      \"Tell us a story, nursie; please do\", begged two little golden-haired  girls, as they snuggled on the soft rug before the fire. \"Did you ever  have just what you wished for at Christmas, when you were a little  girl?\"    \"Yes, I did once. I was the oldest, and had two brothers and three  little sisters. We did not have a beautiful home like this. We lived  in a little cottage. It was pretty, though, in the summer time, when  the roses and pinks were in bloom. My father was dead, and mother  worked for the rich people around the village. There was plenty to do  about holiday times.    \"It was the day before Christmas. Mother was at the house of a  very rich and kind lady. She was going to have a grand party in the  evening.    \"Mother told me, when she went away, to mind the children, and perhaps  I might have a nice Christmas present. I knew we should have plenty of  candy and cake, and other nice things, from Mrs. Reid's. We often had  pretty clothes, too, that Mamie and Robbie Reid had outgrown.    \"I had been wishing for a muff; but I knew Mother could not afford to  buy me one. It was hard enough even to get shoes for us all. I thought  I should have to be satisfied with mittens.    \"It was quite dark, and we all sat around the fire. I had rocked Tilly  to sleep and put her to bed. Willie and Joe were playing cat's-cradle.  The rest of us were making believe we were rich and could have all we  wanted for Christmas.    \"All at once there was a heavy step on the porch, and a knock at the  door. I opened it, with Margie and Amy clinging to my dress. A boy  shoved a big box into the room and shouted, 'A merry Christmas to  you!' He then ran out at the gate.    \"The box had all our names on the cover, and the children were wild to  see what was inside.    \"'Wait till mother comes,' I said; and pretty soon we heard her at  the gate, She seemed surprised, and said Santa Claus had remembered us  early.    \"Mother advised us to go to bed and wait until morning to see our  presents. It was pretty hard; but we had some oranges and candy, and I  put the boys to bed. Margie and I wondered and guessed what was in the  box; but at last we fell asleep.    \"You may be sure we were up early in the morning. There were dolls and  toys for the little ones, with hoods and mittens, and for me a lovely  squirrel muff, lined with blue, with a soft little boa for my neck. I  was a happy girl that Christmas, I can tell you.    \"And now, my dears, you must go to bed, or Santa Claus will not be  able to find your stockings.\"    \"Oh! I hope I shall have what I want to-morrow!\" said Gracie.    \"And I, too,\" echoed Helen. \"And your story was very nice, nursie.\"    \"Good-night, and call us early in the morning.\"          SANTA CLAUS'S LETTER.      Christmas was coming. Jamie and Ted had already begun to write long  letters to Santa Claus. But one thing was rather queer: both boys  asked him for the same things.    Each little letter ended with,--\"Just like Brother's.\"    They agreed to ask for only one sled. They would rather ride together.  Now was not this very sweet and loving?    One night, after they had gone to bed, Jamie said, \"Ted, if Santa  Claus brings us skates, Jim can teach us how to use them.\"    \"Oh, yes; and if we get fur mittens it will be such fun to make a  fort.\"    \"And a snow-man,\" Jamie answered.    Ted went oh: \"I'll always ride the sled down a hill, and you can ride  it up.\"    \"I guess you won't,\" Jamie said, speaking loudly.    \"Why not?\" Ted asked.    \"Because it'll be as much my sled as yours.\"    \"Yes, of course,\" Ted replied; \"but I chose it first.\"    \"You are a selfish boy!\" said Jamie.    \"Well, then, so are you!\"    \"I don't care. I won't sleep with you. I'll ask mamma if I can't have  the first pick; I'm the biggest,\" roared Jamie, bounding out of bed.    \"You're a big, cross cry baby,\" Ted shouted, jumping out after his  brother.    Away ran Jamie to mamma, with Ted at his heels. Both were angry. Both  talked at once.    Mamma was grieved. Her dear little boys had never been so unkind to  each other before. She kissed their hot faces and stroked their pretty  hair. She told them how their naughty words hurt her. She showed them  how displeased God was to see two little brothers quarrel.    That night they went to sleep in each other's arms, full of love and  forgiveness.    Christmas morning came at last. Very early the boys crept out of bed,  just to \"feel\" their stockings.    Papa heard them, and, remembering that he was once a boy lighted the  gas.    Each little red stocking was full from toe to top. Boxes and paper  parcels were piled around them. Such shouting! Such a good time! It  seemed as if all their letters had been answered.    Suddenly Jamie cried, \"O Ted, here's a letter!\"    They put their little heads together, and with papa's help spelled  this out:--        \"My dear Boys,--No sled this year. It quarrelled so I was      afraid to bring it. I dropped it off the load about a week      ago. Get ready for it next year. Merry Christmas! SANTA      CLAUS.\"          A RAGGED CHRISTMAS FEAST.      On Christmas day there is a great feast in Dublin. This, you know, is  the chief city of Ireland. The feast is made for the children. There  are in that city a great many little ones who are very very poor.  There are kind people there, also, who look after these poor children.  They have what they call \"ragged schools,\" where many of them are  taught to read, and to sew, and other useful things.    Dr. Nelaton is a famous minister in Dublin, and every year he, with  other good people, gets up this great feast for the children.  About eight hundred of them came last year. Some of these were only  half-clad, and all were very ragged. They were seated at long, narrow  tables, which were covered with a white cloth, The children from the  ragged schools wore aprons in bright colors, to hide their rags. Each  school had a color of its own. These aprons were only lent them for  the day, and the children felt very fine in them. But there were two  long rows without any aprons. These were little ones who had been  picked up along the streets. Each ragged scholar had permission to  bring all the children he could find. And, oh, how ragged and dirty  these two rows were!    But they brightened up, just like the children with aprons, when they  saw the feast. A huge mug of steaming tea and an immense bun to each  child! Rarely did they have such a treat as this. And how they did  eat! Each child had all he wanted. It would have done you good to see  their poor, pinched faces beam with delight. During the meal a large  throng of orphan children in the gallery sung some sweet songs. Then,  after the feast, there were small gifts, and little speeches and  prayers, and more songs. The little ragged ones seemed like new beings  in this atmosphere of love. Such a glad day as that Christmas was a  rare event in their sad lives. Children who live in happy homes know  little about the sufferings of the poor. Perhaps, if they knew more,  such little ones would try harder, by gifts and kind acts, to carry  sunshine to sorrowful hearts."]]]
