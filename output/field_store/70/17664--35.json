This metallic system did not however succeed; the poor  bird drooped gradually, his strength just lasted him to walk with a  stately step into the court of the Consulate, and he died in about an  hour afterwards. On a _post mortem_ examination, at which I was  present, about three pounds of iron were taken from his stomach. A  considerable portion of the hardest parts, such as the blades of the  knives and razor, was dissolved; and it is possible that the whole  might in time have been digested, as the death of the animal was in  part accidental, being immediately occasioned by a sharp  boat-builder's nail, three or four inches long, which he had  swallowed, and which had penetrated quite through the stomach, and  produced mortification.\"    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *      EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND AIR ON PLANTS.      The importance of light and air to plants is well known. When  unassisted by these agents, plants lose their colour, and are deprived  of many of their properties. Colour is thus evidently produced by the  absorption of carbonic acid gas: and the colouring matter may be  detected by a powerful microscope, lodged in the cellular substance of  the leaf. How this colour is formed, and why it assumes different  tints in different plants, are, however, questions which it is at  present impossible to decide. The secretions of plants depend upon  light, and their flavour and nutritious qualities are materially  altered by their exclusion from it. The importance of this knowledge  to a practical horticulturist is proved by the fact, that sea-kale, so  well known as a wholesome and palatable vegetable, is not eatable in  its original state; and that any part of the cultivated plant, if  accidentally left exposed to the action of the air and light, becomes  tough, and so strong in flavour as to be extremely unpleasant to the  taste. Celery, also, in its native state, is poisonous; and it is only  the parts that are blanched that are perfectly fitted for the table.  Though colour is generally supposed to depend principally on the  plant's being exposed to the light, some portion of colouring matter  appears to be occasionally absorbed by the root. This colouring  substance is, however, never a deep green. Red and yellow, as may be  seen in forced rhubarb, &c., are the most common hues. Succulent  plants are less susceptible of the influence of light than any others.  As they are always natives of hot countries, nature, to prevent the  danger they would be exposed to from excessive evaporation, has  provided them with leaves almost destitute of pores; and the moisture  they absorb by their roots thus remains for the nourishment of the  plant. It is for this reason that cactuses, mesembryanthemums, and  other plants of a similar description, require very little water when  kept in pots. Scarcely any carbon is found in plants grown in the  dark. Many experiments have been tried to show the stimulus afforded  to vegetation by light; trees of the same species and variety have  been planted in the same garden and the same soil, but against walls  with different aspects, and differently situated with regard to shade.  The effect has been, not only a difference in the growth and  appearance of the tree, but also in the size, colour, and flavour of  the fruit which it produced. The contrast between plants grown in  hot-houses with wooden sash frames, and those grown in hot-houses with  iron sash-frames, has been found equally striking; the difference of  light between the two kinds of houses being as seven to twenty-seven,  or, sometimes, as three to twenty-three. Light is required at an early  period of vegetation; but, as its properties are to give strength and  flavour, it must be admitted with caution, as it is sometimes  injurious. Too much light renders the skin of fruits tough, and will  make cucumbers bitter. Berard of Montpelier found that the ripening of  fruits is merely the turning the acid which they contain into sugar,  by exposure to the light; and that too much light and heat, before  they have attained their proper size, will bring on premature  ripening, and make them insipid.    _Lindley's Lectures, reported in the Gardeners' Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      PLANTS IN ROOMS.      It is very difficult to make plants grow in rooms. They must  necessarily be deficient in the three important auxiliaries to  vegetable life, light, air, and moisture; the latter of which cannot  be maintained in apartments that are daily occupied. In large towns,  plants cannot thrive even in the open air, as the minute particles of  soot, which are constantly floating about, settle upon their leaves,  and choke up their pores. The gases produced by the combustion of  coal, &c., are also injurious to plants. Sulphurous acid, which  abounds in the atmosphere of London, turns the leaves yellow; and the  want of evaporation and absorption by the leaves prevents the proper  elaboration of the sap, and makes the trees stunted and unproductive.    _Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *      THE CHLAMYPHORUS.      In our account of _the Nine-banded Armadillo_, at page 57 of the  present volume, we noticed the curious fact of the whole series of  armadillos offering a notable example of one genus being confined to a  particular country, viz. South America; of their standing perfectly  insulated, and exhibiting all the characters of a creation entirely  distinct, and, except as to the general character of mammiferous  quadrupeds, perfectly of its own kind.    The nearest resemblance to the armadillo is, we believe, to be traced  in a very curious little quadruped which is occasionally to be seen in  the district of Cuyo, at the foot of the Andes, on the eastern side.  The first instance of its being brought to Europe was a specimen  preserved in spirit, which was added to the Museum of the Zoological  Society, about four years since, by the Hon. Capt. Percy, R.N. who  received it from Woodbine Parish, Esq. British consul at Buenos Ayres.  It had been previously known only by the figures and description given  by Dr. Harlan, in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New  York. His specimen was, however, deprived of the skeleton and internal  parts, which are perfect in the specimen, in one of the lower rooms of  the Museum in Bruton-street. It is called the _Chlamyphorus_, and may  be said to unite the habits of the mole with the appearance of the  armadillo. Its upper parts and sides are defended by a coat, or rather  cloak, of mail, of a coriaceous nature, but exceeding in inflexibility  sole-leather of equal thickness. This cloak does not adhere, like that  of the armadillo, to the whole surface, occupying the place of the  skin--but is applied over the skin and fur, forming an additional  covering, which is attached only along the middle of the back and on  the head. The hinder parts of the animal are also protected by it, to  cover which, it is suddenly bent downwards at nearly a right angle.  The tail is short, and is directed forwards along the under surface of  the body. Owing to the rigidity of the case which so nearly encloses  the animal, its motions must be limited almost entirely to those of  mere progression, and even for these, the structure of its fore-feet  is ill suited. The anterior limbs are, indeed, scarcely fitted for any  other purpose than that of burrowing. For this operation, the long and  broad claws with which they are furnished are truly admirably adapted;  and their sharp points and cutting lower edges must materially assist  in clearing through the entangled roots which the animal may encounter  in its subterranean travels. Its teeth resemble those of the sloth  more nearly than any other animal's; and it seems to represent,  beneath the earth, that well-known and singular inhabitant of  trees--for its motions, so far as can be conjectured from its  conformation, must also be executed with extreme slowness.    [Illustration: (The Chlamyphorus.)]    The dimensions of the specimen in the Museum are as follow: length  from tip of nose to root of tail, 5-1/2 inches; ditto tail, 1-1/4 in.;  height at shoulder, 1-3/4 in. A more detailed account of the internal  structure and economy of this extraordinary little animal will be  found in the _Zoological Journal_, vols. ii. and iii.           *       *       *       *       *      ARROW ROOT.      [Mr. Andrew Mathews, of Lima, has communicated to the _Gardeners'  Magazine_ the following account of the Otaheitan method of preparing  the excellent farinaceous substance termed _Arrow Root_, so  extensively used in this country.]    The root (_Tacca_ pinnatifida _Lin._, the _Pea_ of the natives) grows  in the greatest abundance in all the islands which we visited; viz.,  in Otaheite, Eimeo, Huaheine, Raiatea, and Otaha. Its favourite  situation is on the sides and ridges of the hills which rise directly  from the sea, and which are generally covered with a coarse grass, on  a red sandy loam. The root is round, white, smooth, full of eyes like  a potato, and from 2 to 3 in. in diameter. The flower-stem rises  directly from the root, simple; from 2 to 4 ft. in height, as thick as  a man's finger, bearing its flowers in a loose simple umbel on the  summit; and, when large and full blown, it presents a beautiful and  delicate appearance. The leaf is large, tri-pinnatifid, segments  acute, of a rich shining green: it is subject to great variation in  the size of the segments, some leaves being much more cut, and having  the segments narrower, than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#4)"],[1," heart was cold within her. \"I told Mr. Raut it was just  possible you might come back,\" she said in a voice that never quivered.    Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little  work-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes  under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes  went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then  back to the woman.    By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another.  Yet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.    It was the husband's voice that broke the silence at last.    \"You wanted to see me?\" he said to Raut.    Raut started as he spoke. \"I came to see you,\" he said, resolved to lie to  the last.    \"Yes,\" said Horrocks.    \"You promised,\" said Raut, \"to show me some fine effects of moonlight and  smoke.\"    \"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,\"  repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.    \"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the  works,\" proceeded Raut, \"and come with you.\"    There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did  he, after all, know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the  moment when they heard the door, their attitudes ... Horrocks glanced at  the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he  glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. \"Of course,\" he  said, \"I promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic  conditions. It's odd how I could have forgotten.\"    \"If I am troubling you--\" began Raut.    Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry  gloom of his eyes. \"Not in the least.\" he said.    \"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow  you think so splendid?\" said the woman, turning now to her husband for  the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her voice just one  half-note too high--\"that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is  beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I thought he would not  spare you, Mr. Raut. It's his great theory, his one discovery in art.\"    \"I am slow to make discoveries,\" said Horrocks grimly, damping her  suddenly. \"But what I discover ...\" He stopped.    \"Well?\" she said.    \"Nothing;\" and suddenly he rose to his feet.    \"I promised to show you the works,\" he said to Raut, and put his big,  clumsy hand on his friend's shoulder. \"And you are ready to go?\"    \"Quite,\" said Raut, and stood up also.    There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness of  the dusk at the other two.    Horrocks' hand still rested on Raut's shoulder. Raut half fancied still  that the incident was trivial after all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her  husband better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in  her mind took a vague shape of physical evil. \"Very well,\" said Horrocks,  and, dropping his hand, turned towards the door.    \"My hat?\" Raut looked round in the half-light.    \"That's my work-basket,\" said Mrs. Horrocks with a gust of hysterical  laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. \"Here it  is!\" he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she  could not frame a word. \"Don't go!\" and \"Beware of him!\" struggled in her  mind, and the swift moment passed.    \"Got it?\" said Horrocks, standing with the door half open.    Raut stepped towards him. \"Better say goodbye to Mrs. Horrocks,\" said the  ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.    Raut started and turned. \"Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks,\" he said, and their  hands touched.    Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him  towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her  husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut's light footfall and her  husband's heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage  together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving  slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared for a  moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were  hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a  moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling  nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know.  Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her  eyes-wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that  flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude  scarcely changed.    The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They  went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into the  cinder-made byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley.    A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery.  Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by  the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there a gas-lit  window, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or crowded  public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the evening  sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few  smokeless during a season of \"play.\" Here and there a pallid patch and  ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank or a  wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery  where they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at hand was the  broad stretch of railway, and half-invisible trains shunted--a steady  puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing concussion and a rhymthic  series of impacts, and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam  across the further view. And to the left, between the railway and the  dark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view, colossal,  inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great  cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of  the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and  threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten  iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the  steam-hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and  thither. Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the  giants, and the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black  dust came boiling upwards towards the sky.    \"Certainly you get some colour with your furnaces,\" said Raut, breaking a  silence that had become apprehensive.    Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at  the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as if he  were thinking out some knotty problem.    Raut glanced at him and away again. \"At present your moonlight effect is  hardly ripe,\" he continued, looking upward; \"the moon is still smothered  by the vestiges of daylight.\"    Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly  awakened. \"Vestiges of daylight? ... Of course, of course.\" He too looked  up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. \"Come along,\" he said  suddenly, and gripping Raut's arm in his hand, made a move towards the  path that dropped from them to the railway.    Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that  their lips came near to say. Horrocks's hand tightened and then relaxed.  He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in arm, and  walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.    \"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,\" said  Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and tightening  the grip of his elbow the while--\"little green lights and red and white  lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It's fine.  And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come down  the hill. That to the right is my pet--seventy feet of him. I packed him  myself, and he's boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five  long years. I've a particular fancy for _him_. That line of red  there--a lovely bit of warm orange you'd call it, Raut--that's the  puddlers' furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three black figures--did  you see the white splash of the steam-hammer then?--that's the rolling  mills. Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor!  Sheet tin, Raut,--amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it when that  stuff comes from the mill. And, squelch! there goes the hammer again. Come  along!\"    He had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into Raut's  with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards  the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had  simply hung back against Horrocks's pull with all his strength.    \"I say,\" he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undertone of snarl  in his voice, \"why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and  dragging me along like this?\"    At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. \"Nipping your  arm off?\" he said. \"Sorry. But it's you taught me the trick of walking  in that friendly way.\"    \"You haven't learnt the refinements of it yet then,\" said Raut, laughing  artificially again. \"By Jove! I'm black and blue.\" Horrocks offered no  apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence  that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out  with their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of  down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with  their descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a notice-board, bearing,  still dimly visible, the words, \"BEWARE OF THE TRAINS,\" half hidden by  splashes of coaly mud.    \"Fine"]]]
