Volume 10, No. 275, (#4)"],[1,"st, notwithstanding the pumps had  been kept constantly going.--\"Well,\" said Thomson, in a low tone, not  to be heard by the crew, \"we'll do our best, as long as she floats,  but that cannot now be much longer--it's all over with us, depend upon  it!\" There was no time for argument; the pumps were now the chief  object of our attention; and Thomson and myself, with the secunnies,  plied them incessantly, until we were ready to drop down with fatigue.    In a short time we found that the water brought up by the pumps bore a  brownish colour, and, on tasting it, that it was sweet; so that it was  evident we were pumping up the sugar, which being contained in  baskets, was but ill protected against water. Such is the fondness for  life, that on the appearance of any sudden or immediate cause of  dissolution, any consideration unconnected with the paramount one of  preservation, is set at naught; thus, although I was sensible that my  valuable cargo was momentarily diminishing, and my property wasting  away, I then felt no disposition to regret my loss, the powers of my  mind, and the affections of my heart, being all engaged on higher  objects.    Those lascars who could at all be brought to the pumps were in so  wretched and debilitated a state, as to require constant reliefs. For  one day and two nights, except a few short intervals, Thomson and  myself, with the secunnies, were at the pumps: at the end of that  time, our hands were blistered to such a degree, that the skin having  peeled off, the raw flesh appeared; our arms, thighs, and legs were so  dreadfully swelled, and our loins in such tormenting pain, as to make  it impossible for us to continue the exertion, without suffering  extreme agony; and nothing but the melancholy conviction that we must  continue our labour, or perish, could possibly have sustained us under  such hardships--hardships, however, which we had the heartfelt  satisfaction to find were so far from being useless, that on perusing  the sounding-rod, when pulled up from the well, (which we did under  feelings of extreme anxiety and eagerness,) we were convinced that the  water did not gain upon us. Our spirits, however, received no  encouragement from the appearance of the elements; the clouds were  black and frowning, and all around still bore a threatening  appearance, the hurricane indeed having rather increased than in the  slightest degree abated.    The circumstance of our having on board so perishable and light a  cargo as soft sugar, it is remarkable, was the very means of our  preservation. Had it consisted of almost any other article, either of  pepper or of dead wood, we must inevitably have perished. To have  thrown overboard any heavy cargo, would, from the constant and heavy  breaches which the sea made over us, have been impossible. Neither  could the masts have been cut away, for the purpose of lightening the  vessel, in consequence of the imbecile condition of the crew; a  recourse to so hazardous a measure would, under our circumstances,  most likely have proved the cause of our destruction. As it was, from  constant pumping for three days, we found our vessel as light and  buoyant as a cork, and, with the exception of the baskets in which the  sugar had been stowed, as empty as when I first purchased her.    Night approached, bringing with it additional horrors. The secunnies,  who had hitherto borne their hardships with admirable fortitude, now  began to droop, and to express a violent inclination for more rum,  although as much had been given them as they could possibly bear;  indeed, rum, with dough, half-baked, had formed their only sustenance  during the whole period of our sufferings. As for the pumps, we were  now so lightened, they did not require to be worked at all; but the  greatest dread we laboured under was from the dangerous condition of  the main and fore masts, that tottered to and fro, threatening to go  by the board every minute. Before the hour of sunset, a large bird,  called the albatross, with wings the length of four to five feet each,  skimmed along the surface of the waves, close to and around us; this  inspired the crew with hopes, as they supposed it to be a good omen.  It remained hovering near our unfortunate wreck for some minutes,  until it alighted on the waves, where it was seen riding perfectly at  ease, and with the majesty of a fine large swan, now on the summit of  a tremendous mountain of waters, and now in the ravines of a wide and  deep abyss. At length darkness once more encompassed us around, and  seemed to shut us out from even a ray of hope; the desponding few,  whose senses were still left them, apparently felt with more acuteness  than before, the desperation and horrors of their condition. At the  hour of eight P.M., however, the wind suddenly changed from south-east  to south-west, and soon appeared to be dying away. At this happy  circumstance, whereby a prospect of deliverance from the very depths  of despair was opened to us, the feelings manifested by the crew were  as singular as they were various; some shouted for joy--some  cried--others muttered prayers--while a few were still despondent,  presenting wild and savage-looking features, and seeming to regret  that the billows had not swallowed them up.--_Adventures of  Naufragus_.           *       *       *       *       *      DAMP BEDS.      Clean sheets are not remarkably common at common inns, where, I am  informed, that the practice is to take them from the bed, sprinkle  them with water, to fold them down, and then put them in a press. When  they are wanted again, they are, literally speaking, shewn to the  fire, and in a reeking state laid on the bed. The traveller is tired  and sleepy, dreams of that pleasure or that business which brought him  from home, and the remotest thing from his mind is, that from the very  repose which he fancies has refreshed him, he has received the  rheumatism. The receipt, therefore, to sleep comfortably at inns, is  to take your own sheets, to have plenty of flannel gowns, and to  promise, and take care to pay, a handsome consideration for the  liberty of choosing your beds. Damp beds are oftenest found in inns  that are least visited; they ought to be carefully avoided, for they  not only produce dreadful disorders, but have often proved the death  of the person who has had the misfortune to sleep in them. Especially  in winter, not only examine the beds, to see whether they are quite  dry, but have the bedclothes in your presence put before the fire.  Just before you go to bed, order a pan of hot coals to be run through  it, then place a clean tumbler inverted between the sheets, and let it  remain there for a few minutes;--if on withdrawing it the slightest  cloud is observable on the inner surface, be certain that either the  bed or the sheets are damp: sleeping in the blankets is a  disagreeable, but the safest way of escaping such danger: there are  many persons in the habit of travelling, who make it a constant  practice. A wash leather sheet, about 8 feet by 5, is not an  unpleasant substitute for linen. But the only absolutely safe plan is,  to sleep in a bed which you are sure has been occupied the night  before; and that, must be the best-aired bed which was slept in by the  best-aired person!--Qy. The cook?--_The Traveller's Oracle_.           *       *       *       *       *      BURMAN THIEVES.      The Burmans used to approach, on dark nights, on their hands and  knees, and often crawled close up to the sentinels, before they were  discovered; sometimes they carried off knapsacks and arms, and went  away with their booty unperceived.    A laughable instance of their dexterity took place in the Great  Pagoda, on the night of the 2nd July. The soldiers, for several nights  previous, had missed some arms, although a sentry was before the door,  and they generally slept with their firelocks by their sides. This  evening, every one was on the alert, extra sentries were posted, and  every precaution taken to secure the marauders. When, on a sudden, the  alarm being given, the officer on duty, who was reposing in one of the  little temples, ran to the door and inquired what had occurred,--but  hearing that only a knapsack had been found in the grass, and that no  other traces existed of the depredators, he turned round to lie down  again, and, to his infinite astonishment, found his bed had vanished!  A light was in the room, and a servant sleeping near it, yet,  notwithstanding, the impudent thieves had also ransacked a basket, and  escaped with the contents! We since heard that the robbers were Burman  soldiers belonging to the camp at Kumaroot, whither they carried their  spoils. They certainly deserved infinite credit for the ingenuity they  manifested, and for the manner in which they turned the laugh against  us, by showing, that the very moment they chose for their  depredations, was one when a strict search was making after them.    _Two Years in Ava_.           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.

Having had charge of the erection of a large number of these mills for  power purposes, I will refer to a few of them in different States,  giving the actual results accomplished, and leaving you to form your own  opinion as to the power developed.    In 1877 a 25-foot diameter mill was erected at Dover, Kansas, a few  miles southwest of Topeka. It was built to do custom flour and feed  grinding, also corn shelling, and is in successful operation at the  present time. We have letters frequently from the owner; one of recent  date states that it has stood all of the \"Kansas zephyrs,\" never having  been damaged as yet. On an average it shells and grinds from 6 to 10  bushels of corn per hour, and runs a 14 inch burr stone, grinding wheat  at the same time. During strong winds it has shelled and ground as high  as 30 bushels of corn per hour. Plate 2 is from a photograph of this  mill and building as it stands. One bevel pinion is all the repairs this  mill has required.    In the spring of 1880 there was erected a 25-foot diameter mill at  Harvard, Clay County, Neb. After this mill had been running nineteen  months, we received the following report from the owner:    \"During the nineteen months we have been running the wind mill, it has  cost us nothing for repairs. We run it with a two-hole corn sheller, a  set of 16-inch burr stones, and an elevator. We grind all kinds of feed,  also corn meal and Graham flour. We have ground 8,340 bushels, and would  have ground much more if corn had not been a very poor crop here for the  past two seasons; besides, we have our farm to attend to, and cannot  keep it running all the time that we have wind. We have not run a full  day at any time, but have ground 125 bushels in a day. When the burr is  in good shape we can grind 20 bushels an hour, and shell at the same  time in the average winds that we have. The mill has withstood storms  without number, even one that blew down a house near it, and another  that blew down many smaller mills. It is one of the best investments any  one can make.\"    The writer saw this mill about sixty days ago, and it is in good shape,  and doing the work as stated. The only repairs that it has required  during four years was one bevel pinion put on this spring.    The owner of a 16-foot diameter mill, erected at Blue Springs. Neb.,  says that \"with a fair wind it grinds easily 15 bushels of corn per hour  with a No. 3 grinder, also runs a corn-sheller and pump at the same  time, and that it works smoothly and is entirely self-regulating.\"    The No. 3 grinder referred to has chilled iron burrs, and requires from  3 to 4 horse-power to grind 15 bushels of corn per hour. Of one of these  16-foot mills that has been running since 1875 in Northern Illinois, the  owner writes: \"In windy days I saw cord-wood as fast as the wood can be  handled, doing more work than I used to accomplish with five horses.\"    The owner of one of these mills, 20 feet in diameter, running in the  southwestern part of this State, writes that he has a corn-sheller and  two iron grinding mills with 8-inch burrs attached to it; also a bolting  device; that this mill is more profitable to him than 80 acres of good  corn land, and that it is easily handled and has never been out of  order. The following report on one of these 16-foot mills, running in  northern Illinois, may be of interest: This mill stands between the  house and barn. A connection is made to a pump in a well-house 25 feet  distant, and is also arranged to operate a churn and washing machine. By  means of sheaves and wire cable, power is transmitted to a circular saw  35 feet distant. In this same manner power is transmitted to the barn  200 feet distant, where connection is made to a thrasher, corn-sheller,  feed-cutter, and fanning-mill. The corn-sheller is a three horse-power,  with fan and sacker attached. Three hundred bushels per day has been  shelled, cleaned, and sacked. The thrashing machine is a two horsepower  with vibrating attachment for separating straw from grain. One man has  thrashed 300 bushels of oats per day, and on windy days says the mill  would run a thrasher of double this capacity. The saw used is 18 inches  diameter, and on windy days saws as much wood as can be done by six  horses working on a sweep power. The owner furnishes the following  approximate cost of mill with the machinery attached and now in use on  his place:      1 16-foot power wind mill, shafting, and tower.    $385    1 Two horse thrasher.                                70    1 Three horse sheller.                               38    1 Feed grinder.                                      50    1 18-inch saw, frame and arbor.                      40    1 Fanning mill.                                      25    1 Force pump.                                        27    1 Churn.                                              5    1 Washing machine.                                   15    Belting, cables, and pulleys.                        45                                                       ----                                         Total.        $700    The following facts and figures furnished by the owner will give a fair  idea of the economic value of this system, as compared with the usual  methods of doing the same work. On the farm where it is used, there are  raised annually an average of sixty acres of oats, fifty acres of corn,  twenty acres of rye, ten acres of buckwheat.                                                       Bushels.    The oats average, say 30 bushels per acre.        1,800    Corn        \"         30    \"        \"            1,500    Rye         \"         20    \"        \"              400    Buckwheat   \"         20    \"        \"              200    Grinding for self and others.                     1,000      It will cost to thrash this grain, shell the corn, and      grind the feed with steam power.                 $285    And sawing wood, 121/2 cords.                          18    Pumping, one hour per day, 365 days.                 36    Churning, half hour per day, 200 days.               10    Washing, half day per week, 26 days.                 26                                                       ----                                       Total.          $375    This amount is saved, and more too, as one man, by the aid of the wind  mill, will do this work in connection with the chores of the farm, and  save enough in utilizing foul weather to more than offset his extra  labor, cost of oil, etc., for the machinery. The amount saved each year  is just about equal to the cost of a good man. Cost of outfit,  $700--just about equal to the cost of a good man for two years,  consequently, it will pay for itself in two years. Fifteen years is a  fair estimate for the lifetime of mill with ordinary repairs.    The solid-wheel wind mill has never been built larger than 30 feet in  diameter. For mills larger than this, the latest improved American mill  is the \"Warwick\" pattern.    A 30-foot mill of this pattern, erected in 1880, in northwestern Iowa,  gave the following results, as reported by the owner:    \"Attachments as follows: One 22-inch burr; one No. 4 iron feed-mill; one  26-inch circular saw; one two-hole corn-sheller; one grain elevater; a  bolting apparatus for fine meal, buckwheat and graham, all of which are  run at the same time in good winds, except the saw or the iron mill;  they being run from the same pulley can run but one at a time. With all  attached and working up to their full capacity, the sails are often  thrown out of the wind by the governors, which shows an immense power.  The machines are so arranged that I can attach all or separately,  according to the wind. With the burr alone I have ground 500 bushels in  48 consecutive hours, 100 bushels of it being fine meal. I have also  ground 24 full bushels of fine meal for table use in two hours. This  last was my own, consequently was not tolled. This was before I bought  the iron mill, and now I can nearly double that amount. I saw my fire  wood for three fires; all my fence posts, etc. My wood is taken to the  mill from 12 to 15 feet long, and as large as the saw will cut by  turning the stick, consequently the saw requires about the same power as  the burrs. With a good sailing breeze I have all the power I need, and  can run all the machinery with ease. Last winter I ground double the  amount of any water mill in this vicinity. I have no better"]]]
