"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#4)"],[1,"of Saint Edmund, I  will hang him forty cubits high!  But if no man in Nottingham dare win  fourscore angels, I will send elsewhere, for there should be men of  mettle somewhere in this land.\"    Then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust, and bade  him saddle his horse and make ready to go to Lincoln Town to see whether  he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward.  So that same morning the messenger started forth upon his errand.    Bright shone the sun upon the dusty highway that led from Nottingham to  Lincoln, stretching away all white over hill and dale. Dusty was the  highway and dusty the throat of the messenger, so that his heart was  glad when he saw before him the Sign of the Blue Boar Inn, when somewhat  more than half his journey was done. The inn looked fair to his eyes,  and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and  pleasant, so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time,  calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat.    There he saw a party of right jovial fellows seated beneath the  spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door. There was  a tinker, two barefoot friars, and a party of six of the King's  foresters all clad in Lincoln green, and all of them were quaffing  humming ale and singing merry ballads of the good old times. Loud  laughed the foresters, as jests were bandied about between the singing,  and louder laughed the friars, for they were lusty men with beards that  curled like the wool of black rams; but loudest of all laughed the  Tinker, and he sang more sweetly than any of the rest. His bag and his  hammer hung upon a twig of the oak tree, and near by leaned his good  stout cudgel, as thick as his wrist and knotted at the end.    \"Come,\" cried one of the foresters to the tired messenger, \"come join us  for this shot.  Ho, landlord!  Bring a fresh pot of ale for each man.\"    The messenger was glad enough to sit down along with the others who were  there, for his limbs were weary and the ale was good.    \"Now what news bearest thou so fast?\" quoth one, \"and whither ridest  thou today?\"    The messenger was a chatty soul and loved a bit of gossip dearly;  besides, the pot of ale warmed his heart; so that, settling himself in  an easy corner of the inn bench, while the host leaned upon the doorway  and the hostess stood with her hands beneath her apron, he unfolded his  budget of news with great comfort.  He told all from the very first: how  Robin Hood had slain the forester, and how he had hidden in the  greenwood to escape the law; how that he lived therein, all against the  law, God wot, slaying His Majesty's deer and levying toll on fat abbot,  knight, and esquire, so that none dare travel even on broad Watling  Street or the Fosse Way for fear of him; how that the Sheriff had a mind  to serve the King's warrant upon this same rogue, though little would he  mind warrant of either king or sheriff, for he was far from being a law-  abiding man. Then he told how none could be found in all Nottingham Town  to serve this warrant, for fear of cracked pates and broken bones, and  how that he, the messenger, was now upon his way to Lincoln Town to find  of what mettle the Lincoln men might be.    \"Now come I, forsooth, from good Banbury Town,\" said the jolly Tinker,  \"and no one nigh Nottingham--nor Sherwood either, an that be the mark--  can hold cudgel with my grip.  Why, lads, did I not meet that mad wag  Simon of Ely, even at the famous fair at Hertford Town, and beat him in  the ring at that place before Sir Robert of Leslie and his lady? This  same Robin Hood, of whom, I wot, I never heard before, is a right merry  blade, but gin he be strong, am not I stronger? And gin he be sly, am  not I slyer?  Now by the bright eyes of Nan o' the Mill, and by mine own  name and that's Wat o' the Crabstaff, and by mine own mother's son, and  that's myself, will I, even I, Wat o' the Crabstaff, meet this same  sturdy rogue, and gin he mind not the seal of our glorious sovereign  King Harry, and the warrant of the good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, I  will so bruise, beat, and bemaul his pate that he shall never move  finger or toe again! Hear ye that, bully boys?\"    \"Now art thou the man for my farthing,\" cried the messenger. \"And back  thou goest with me to Nottingham Town.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, shaking his head slowly from side to side. \"Go  I with no man gin it be not with mine own free will.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" said the messenger, \"no man is there in Nottinghamshire  could make thee go against thy will, thou brave fellow.\"    \"Ay, that be I brave,\" said the Tinker.    \"Ay, marry,\" said the messenger, \"thou art a brave lad; but our good  Sheriff hath offered fourscore angels of bright gold to whosoever shall  serve the warrant upon Robin Hood; though little good will it do.\"    \"Then I will go with thee, lad.  Do but wait till I get my bag and  hammer, and my cudgel.  Ay, let' me but meet this same Robin Hood, and  let me see whether he will not mind the King's warrant.\"  So, after  having paid their score, the messenger, with the Tinker striding beside  his nag, started back to Nottingham again.    One bright morning soon after this time, Robin Hood started off to  Nottingham Town to find what was a-doing there, walking merrily along  the roadside where the grass was sweet with daisies, his eyes wandering  and his thoughts also. His bugle horn hung at his hip and his bow and  arrows at his back, while in his hand he bore a good stout oaken staff,  which he twirled with his fingers as he strolled along.    As thus he walked down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming, trolling a  merry song as he drew nigh.  On his back hung his bag and his hammer,  and in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long,  and thus sang he:     \"_In peascod time, when hound to horn       Gives ear till buck be killed,   And little lads with pipes of corn       Sit keeping beasts afield_--\"    \"Halloa, good friend!\" cried Robin.    \"I WENT TO GATHER STRAWBERRIES--\"    \"Halloa!\" cried Robin again.    \"BY WOODS AND GROVES FULL FAIR--\"    \"Halloa!  Art thou deaf, man?  Good friend, say I!\"  \"And who art thou dost so boldly check a fair song?\" quoth the Tinker,  stopping in his singing.  \"Halloa, shine own self, whether thou be good  friend or no.  But let me tell thee, thou stout fellow, gin thou be a  good friend it were well for us both; but gin thou be no good friend it  were ill for thee.\"    \"And whence comest thou, my lusty blade?\" quoth Robin.    \"I come from Banbury,\" answered the Tinker.    \"Alas!\" quoth Robin, \"I hear there is sad news this merry morn.\"    \"Ha!  Is it indeed so?\" cried the Tinker eagerly. \"Prythee tell it  speedily, for I am a tinker by trade, as thou seest, and as I am in my  trade I am greedy for news, even as a priest is greedy for farthings.\"    \"Well then,\" quoth Robin, \"list thou and I will tell, but bear thyself  up bravely, for the news is sad, I wot.  Thus it is: I hear that two  tinkers are in the stocks for drinking ale and beer!\"    \"Now a murrain seize thee and thy news, thou scurvy dog,\" quoth the  Tinker, \"for thou speakest but ill of good men. But sad news it is  indeed, gin there be two stout fellows in the stocks.\"    \"Nay,\" said Robin, \"thou hast missed the mark and dost but weep for the  wrong sow.  The sadness of the news lieth in that there be but two in  the stocks, for the others do roam the country at large.\"    \"Now by the pewter platter of Saint Dunstan,\" cried the Tinker, \"I have  a good part of a mind to baste thy hide for thine ill jest. But gin men  be put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer, I trow thou wouldst not  lose thy part.\"    Loud laughed Robin and cried, \"Now well taken, Tinker, well taken! Why,  thy wits are like beer, and do froth up most when they grow sour! But  right art thou, man, for I love ale and beer right well. Therefore come  straightway with me hard by to the Sign of the Blue Boar, and if thou  drinkest as thou appearest--and I wot thou wilt not belie thy looks--I  will drench thy throat with as good homebrewed as ever was tapped in all  broad Nottinghamshire.\"    \"Now by my faith,\" said the Tinker, \"thou art a right good fellow in  spite of thy scurvy jests.  I love thee, my sweet chuck, and gin I go  not with thee to that same Blue Boar thou mayst call me a heathen.\"    \"Tell me thy news, good friend, I prythee,\" quoth Robin as they trudged  along together, \"for tinkers, I ween, are all as full of news as an egg  of meat.\"    \"Now I love thee as my brother, my bully blade,\" said the Tinker, \"else  I would not tell thee my news; for sly am I, man, and I have in hand a  grave undertaking that doth call for all my wits, for I come to seek a  bold outlaw that men, hereabouts, call Robin Hood.  Within my pouch I  have a warrant, all fairly written out on parchment, forsooth, with a  great red seal for to make it lawful. Could I but meet this same Robin  Hood I would serve it upon his dainty body, and if he minded it not I  would beat him till every one of his ribs would cry Amen.  But thou  livest hereabouts, mayhap thou knowest Robin Hood thyself, good fellow.\"    \"Ay, marry, that I do somewhat,\" quoth Robin, \"and I have seen him this  very morn.  But, Tinker, men say that he is but a sad, sly thief. Thou  hadst better watch thy warrant, man, or else he may steal it out of thy  very pouch.\"    \"Let him but try!\" cried the Tinker.  \"Sly may he be, but sly am I, too.  I would I had him here now, man to man!\" And he made his heavy cudgel to  spin again.  \"But what manner of man is he, lad?    \"Much like myself,\" said Robin, laughing, \"and in height and build and  age nigh the same; and he hath blue eyes, too.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, \"thou art but a green youth. I thought him to  be a great bearded man.  Nottingham men feared him so.\"    \"Truly, he is not so old nor so stout as thou art,\" said Robin.  \"But"]]]
