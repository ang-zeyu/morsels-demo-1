A trade in horses required to remount the Indian cavalry had  commenced, and the disadvantageous navigation of Torres Straits had been  injurious to it: that drawback was to be avoided by any overland route  from Sydney to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria.    But other considerations, not less important to the colonists of New  South Wales, made it very desirable that a way should be opened to the  shores of the Indian Ocean. That sea was already connected with England  by steam navigation, and to render it accessible to Sydney by land, was  an object in itself worthy of an exploratory expedition. In short, the  commencement of such a journey seemed the first step in the direct road  home to England, for it was not to be doubted that on the discovery of a  good overland route between Sydney and the head of the Gulf of  Carpentaria, a line of steam communication would thereupon be introduced  from that point to meet the English line at Singapore.    In this view of the subject, it seemed more desirable to open a way to  the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the nearest part of the sea, than to  the settlement at Port Essington, on a presque-ile forming the furthest  point of the land; and, that the journey would terminate at the Gulf was  therefore most probable. The map of Australia, when compared with that of  the world, suggested reasonable grounds for believing that a considerable  river would be found to lead to the Gulf of Carpentaria.    My department having been reduced to a state of inactivity in 1843, I  submitted a plan of exploration to Sir George Gipps, the Governor, when  His Excellency promised, that if the Legislative Council made such  reductions as they seemed disposed to make in the public expenditure, he  should be able to spare money for such an expedition. The Legislative  Council not only made reductions in the estimates to save much more money  than His Excellency had named, but even voted 1000L. towards the expense  of the journey, and petitioned the Governor to sanction it. His  Excellency, however, then thought it necessary to refer the subject to  the Secretary for the Colonies. Much time was thus lost, and, what was  still worse, the naturalist to whom I had explained my plan, and invited  to join my party, Dr. Leichardt. This gentleman, tempted by the general  interest taken by the colonists at the time in a journey of discovery,  which afforded a cheering prospect amid the general gloom and  despondency, raised and equipped a small party by public subscription,  and proceeded by water to Moreton Bay. Dr. Leichardt, and the six persons  who finally accompanied him thence to the northward, had not been heard  of, and were supposed to have either perished or been destroyed by  natives. [* Dr. Leichhardt returned afterwards to Sydney from Port  Essington by sea; and the journal of his journey, recently published,  shows what difficulties may be surmounted by energy and perseverance.]    The reply of Lord Stanley was, as might have been anticipated, favourable  to the undertaking; but the Governor of the colony still declined to  allow the journey to be undertaken, without assigning any reason for  keeping it back. This was the more regretted by me, when it became known  in New South Wales that Captain Sturt was employed, with the express  sanction of Lord Stanley, to lead an exploring expedition from Adelaide  into the northern interior of Australia, and that he was actually then in  New South Wales. Sir George Gipps had expressed, in one of his early  despatches to the British Government, his readiness to encourage such an  undertaking as that, and stated that \"no one came forward to claim the  honour of such an enterprise;\" yet now that Lord Stanley had sanctioned  the plan of the Surveyor General, whose duty it was to survey the  country, he refused to allow this officer to proceed. The Legislative  Council, however, renewed the petition for this undertaking, to which the  Governor at length assented, in 1845; and the sum of 2000L. was  unanimously voted for the outfit of the party, but with the clear  understanding on the part of the Council, that the plan of the Surveyor  General should be adopted.    The idea of a river flowing to the northward, was not, however, new. The  journey in 1831 was undertaken chiefly in consequence of a report that a  large river had been followed down to the coast by a bushranger,  accompanied by the natives: and the ultimate course of the Condamine,  still a question, was a subject of controversy in some of the first  papers published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. My  suggestions on the subject are detailed at length in the London  Geographical Journal, Vol. VII., Part 2., page 282., and accompanied by a  map showing the line of exploration then recommended.    In making preparations for this expedition, the means of conveyance by  land and water required the earliest consideration. These were strong  bullock-drays and portable boats. Horses and light carts had been  preferred by me: but the longer column of march, and necessity for a  greater number of men, were considered objections; while many experienced  persons suggested that the bullocks, though slow, were more enduring than  horses. [* The results of this journey proved quite the reverse.] Eight  drays were therefore ordered to be made of the best seasoned wood: four  of these by the best maker in the colony, and four by the prisoners in  Cockatoo Island. Two iron boats were made by Mr. Struth, each in two  parts, on a plan of my own, and on the 17th of November the whole party  moved off from Paramatta on their way to the proposed camp at Buree.    I joined the party encamped at Buree on the 13th of December, having rode  there from Sydney in four and a half days, and on the following Monday,  15th of December, 1845, I put it in motion towards the interior. The  Exploring party now consisted of the following persons:--    SIR T. L. MITCHELL, Kt., Surveyor General, Chief of the Expedition.  EDMUND B. KENNEDY, Esq. Assistant Surveyor, Second in command. W.  STEPHENSON, M.R.C.S.L. Surgeon and Collector of objects of Natural  History. PETER M'AVOY, Mounted Videttes. Charles Niblett, William Graham,  ANTHONY BROWN, Tent-keeper. WILLIAM BALDOCK, In charge of the horses.  John Waugh Drysdale, Store-keeper. Allan Bond, Bullock-drivers. Edward  Taylor, William Bond, William Mortimer, George Allcot, John Slater,  Richard Horton, Felix Maguire, James Stephens, Carpenters. Job Stanley,  Edward Wilson, Blacksmith. George Fowkes, Shoemaker. John Douglas,  Barometer carrier. Isaac Reid, Sailor and Chainman. Andrew Higgs,  Chainman. William Hunter, With the horses. Thomas Smith, Patrick Travers,  Carter and Pioneer. Douglas Arnott, Shepherd and Butcher. Arthur Bristol,  Sailmaker and Sailor.    8 drays, drawn by 80 bullocks; 2 boats; 13 horses; 4 private do.; and 3  light carts, comprised the means of conveyance; and the party was  provided with provisions for a year:--250 sheep (to travel with the  party), constituting the chief part of the animal food. The rest  consisted of gelatine, and a small quantity of pork.    With the exception of a few whose names are printed in italics, the party  consisted of prisoners of the Crown in different stages of probation,  with whom the prospect of additional liberty was an incentive so  powerful, that no money payment was asked by them or expected, while,  from experience, I knew that for such an enterprise as this I could rely  on their zealous services. The patience and resolution of such men in the  face of difficulties, I had already witnessed; and I had hired three of  the old hands, in order the more readily to introduce my accustomed camp  arrangements. Volunteers of all classes had certainly come eagerly  forward, offering their gratuitous services on this expedition of  discovery; but discipline and implicit obedience were necessary in such a  party to ensure the objects in view, as well as its own preservation; and  it was not judged expedient, where some prisoners were indispensable as  mechanics, to mix with them men of a different class, over whom the same  kind of authority could not be exercised.    Following the same road by which I quitted Buree, in 1835, my former line  of route across Hervey's Range lay to the left. The party thus arrived at  Bramadura, a sheep station occupied by Mr. Boyd. It was on the same chain  of ponds crossed by me on the journey of 1835, and then named Dochendoras  Creek, but now known as the Mundadgery chain of ponds. These ponds had  been filled by heavy rains which fell on Tuesday the 9th December--the  day on which I left Sydney, where the weather had been clear and sultry.  A tornado or hurricane had, on the same day, levelled part of the forest  near this place, laying prostrate the largest trees, one side of which  was completely barked by the hailstones. Many branches of trees along the  line of route, showed that the wind had been very violent to a  considerable distance.    16TH DECEMBER.--Some of the bullocks missing: the party could not,  therefore, quit the camp until 11 o'clock. The passage of the bed of the  chain of ponds (which we travelled up) was frequently necessary, and  difficult for heavily laden drays, which I found ours were, owing,  chiefly to a superabundance of flour, above the quantity I intended to  have taken, but supplied to my party, and brought forty miles by my drays  before my arrival at the camp.    We halted at another sheep station of Mr. Boyd's. Here I perceived that  Horehound grew abundantly; and I was assured by Mr. Parkinson, a  gentleman in charge of these stations, that this plant springs up at all  sheep and cattle stations throughout the colony, a remarkable fact, which  may assist to explain another, namely, the appearance of the Couchgrass,  or Dog's-tooth-grass, wherever the white man sets his foot, although"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#3)"],[1,"just as we have been, you and I together? I would consult your  happiness before my own, for it lies very near my heart, my precious  one. I can never forgive myself for all I have made you suffer, and  when you were restored to me almost from the grave, I made a vow to do  all in my power to make your future life bright and happy.\"    His tones were full of deep feeling, and as he spoke he drew her  closer and closer to him and kissed her tenderly again and again.    \"Speak, daughter, and tell me what you wish,\" he said, as she still  remained silent.    At last she spoke, and he bent down to catch the words. \"Dear papa,\"  she whispered, \"would it make you happy? and do you think mamma knows,  and that she would like it?\"    \"Your mamma loves us both too well not to be pleased with anything  that would add to our happiness,\" he replied gently.    \"Dear papa, you won't be angry if I ask another question?'\"'    \"No, darling; ask as many as you wish.\"    \"Then, papa, will I have to call her mamma? and do you think my own  mamma would like it?\"    \"If Miss Allison consents to take a mother's place to you, I am sure  your own mamma, if she could speak to you, would tell you she deserved  to have the title; and it would hurt us both very much if you refused  to give it. Indeed, my daughter, I cannot ask her to come to us unless  you will promise to do so, and to love and obey, her just as you do  me. Will you?\"    \"I will try to obey her, papa; and I shall love her very dearly, for I  do already; but I can not love anybody quite so well as I love you, my  own dear, dear father!\" she said, throwing her arms around his neck.    He returned her caress, saying tenderly, \"That is all I can ask,  dearest; I must reserve the first place in your heart for myself.\"    \"Do you think she will come, papa?\" she asked anxiously.    \"I don't know, daughter; I have not asked her yet. But shall I tell  her that it will add to your happiness if she will be your mamma?\"    \"Yes, sir; and that I will call her mamma, and obey her and love her  dearly. Oh, papa, ask her very soon, won't you?\"    \"Perhaps; but don't set your heart too much on it, for she may not be  quite so willing to take such a troublesome charge as Miss Stevens  seems to be,\" he said, returning to his playful tone.    Elsie looked troubled and anxious.    \"I hope she will, papa,\" she said; \"I think she might be very glad to  come and live with you; and in such a beautiful home, too.\"    \"Ah! but everyone does not appreciate my society as highly as you do,\"  he replied, laughing and pinching her cheek; \"and besides, you forget  about the troublesome little girl. I have heard ladies say they would  not marry a man who had a child.\"    \"But Miss Rose loves me, papa; I am sure she does,\" she said,  flushing, and the tears starting to her eyes.    \"Yes, darling, I know she does,\" he answered soothingly. \"I am only  afraid she loves you better than she does me.\"    A large party of equestrians were setting out from the hotel that  evening soon after tea, and Elsie, in company with several other  little girls, went out upon the veranda to watch them mount and ride  away. She was absent but a few moments from the parlor, where she had  left her father, but when she returned to it he was not there. Miss  Rose, too, was gone, she found upon further search, and though she had  not much difficulty in conjecturing why she had thus, for the first  time, been left behind, she could not help feeling rather lonely and  desolate.    She felt no disposition to renew the afternoon's conversation with  Annie Hart, so she went quietly upstairs to their private parlor and  sat down to amuse herself with a book until Chloe came in from eating  her supper. Then the little girl brought a stool, and seating herself  in the old posture with her head in her nurse's lap, she drew her  mother's miniature from her bosom, and fixing her eyes lovingly upon  it, said, as she had done hundreds of times before: \"Now, mammy,  please tell me about my dear, dear mamma.\"    The soft eyes were full of tears; for with all her joy at the thought  of Rose, mingled a strange sad feeling that she was getting farther  away from that dear, precious, unknown mother, whose image had been,  since her earliest recollection, enshrined in her very heart of  hearts.          CHAPTER II      O lady! there be many things    That seem right fair above;    But sure not one among them all    Is half so sweet as love;--    Let us not pay our vows alone,    But join two altars into one.      --O. W. HOLMES      Here still is the smile that no cloud can o'ercast,    And the heart, and the hand, all thy own to the last.      --MOORE.      Mr. Horace Dinsmore was quite remarkable for his conversational  powers, and Rose, who had always heretofore found him a most  entertaining companion, wondered greatly at his silence on this  particular evening. She waited in vain for him to start some topic of  conversation, but as he did not seem disposed to do so, she at length  made the attempt herself, and tried one subject after another.  Finding, however, that she was answered only in monosyllables, she too  grew silent and embarrassed, and heartily wished for the relief of  Elsie's presence.    She had proposed summoning the child to accompany them as usual, but  Mr. Dinsmore replied that she had already had sufficient exercise, and  he would prefer having her remain at home.    They had walked some distance, and coming to a rustic seat where they  had often rested, they sat down. The moon was shining softly down upon  them, and all nature seemed hushed and still. For some moments neither  of them spoke, but at length Mr. Dinsmore broke the silence.    \"Miss Allison,\" he said, in his deep, rich tones, \"I would like to  tell you a story, if you will do me the favor to listen.\"    It would have been quite impossible for Rose to tell why her heart  beat so fast at this very commonplace remark, but so it was; and she  could scarcely steady her voice to reply, \"I always find your stories  interesting, Mr. Dinsmore.\"    He began at once.    \"Somewhere between ten and eleven years ago, a wild, reckless boy  of seventeen, very much spoiled by the indulgence of a fond, doting  father, who loved and petted him as the only son of his departed  mother, was spending a few months in one of our large Southern cities,  where he met, and soon fell desperately in love with, a beautiful  orphan heiress, some two years his junior.    \"The boy was of too ardent a temperament, and too madly in love, to  brook for a moment the thought of waiting until parents and guardians  should consider them of suitable age to marry, in addition to which he  had good reason to fear that his father, with whom family pride was a  ruling passion, would entirely refuse his consent upon learning that  the father of the young lady had begun life as a poor, uneducated boy,  and worked his way up to wealth and position by dint of hard labor and  incessant application to business.    \"The boy, it is true, was almost as proud himself, but it was not  until the arrows of the boy-god had entered into his heart too  deeply to be extracted, that he learned the story of his charmer's  antecedents. Yet I doubt if the result would have been different had  he been abundantly forewarned; for oh, Miss Rose, if ever an angel  walked the earth in human form it was she!--so gentle, so good, so  beautiful!\"    He heaved a deep sigh, paused a moment, and then went on:    \"Well, Miss Rose, as you have probably surmised, they were privately  married. If that sweet girl had a fault, it was that she was too  yielding to those she loved, and she did love her young husband with  all the warmth of her young guileless heart; for she had neither  parents nor kinsfolk, and he was the one object around which her  affections might cling. They were all the world to each other, and for  a few short months they were very happy.    \"But it could not last; the marriage was discovered--her guardian and  the young man's father were both furious, and they were torn asunder;  she carried away to a distant plantation, and he sent North to attend  college.    \"They were well-nigh distracted, but cherished the hope that when  they should reach their majority and come into possession of their  property, which was now unfortunately entirely in the hands of their  guardians, they would be reunited.    \"But--it is the old story--their letters were intercepted, and the  first news the young husband received of his wife was that she had  died a few days after giving birth to a little daughter.\"    Again Mr. Dinsmore paused, then continued:    \"It was a terrible stroke! For months, reason seemed almost ready to  desert her throne; but time does wonders, and in the course of years  it did much to heal his wounds. You would perhaps suppose that he  would at once--or at least as soon as he was his own master--have  sought out his child, and lavished upon it the wealth of his  affections: but no; he had conceived almost an aversion to it; for he  looked upon it as the cause--innocent, it is true--but still the cause  of his wife's death. He did not know till long years afterwards  that her heart was broken by the false story of his desertion and  subsequent death. Her guardian was a hard, cruel man, though faithful  in his care of her property.    \"With him the child remained until she was about four years old when  a change was made necessary by his death, and she, with her faithful  nurse, was received into her paternal grandfather's family until her  father, who had then gone abroad, should return. But my story is  growing very long, and you will be weary of listening. I will try to  be as brief as possible.    \"The little girl, under the care of her nurse and the faithful  instructions of a pious old Scotchwoman--who had come over with the  child's maternal grandparents, and followed the fortunes of the  daughter and"]]]
