Let us go out to the bench in the grove and talk there.\"    It was still daylight in the open, but under the spreading cottonwoods  shadows were obscuring the lanes. Venters drew Jane off from one of  these into a shrub-lined trail, just wide enough for the two to walk  abreast, and in a roundabout way led her far from the house to a knoll  on the edge of the grove. Here in a secluded nook was a bench from  which, through an opening in the tree-tops, could be seen the sage-slope  and the wall of rock and the dim lines of canyons. Jane had not spoken  since Venters had shocked her with his first harsh speech; but all the  way she had clung to his arm, and now, as he stopped and laid his rifle  against the bench, she still clung to him.    \"Jane, I'm afraid I must leave you.\"    \"Bern!\" she cried.    \"Yes, it looks that way. My position is not a happy one--I can't feel  right--I've lost all--\"    \"I'll give you anything you--\"    \"Listen, please. When I say loss I don't mean what you think. I mean  loss of good-will, good name--that which would have enabled me to stand  up in this village without bitterness. Well, it's too late.... Now, as to  the future, I think you'd do best to give me up. Tull is implacable.  You ought to see from his intention to-day that--But you can't see. Your  blindness--your damned religion!... Jane, forgive me--I'm sore within and  something rankles. Well, I fear that invisible hand will turn its hidden  work to your ruin.\"    \"Invisible hand? Bern!\"    \"I mean your Bishop.\" Venters said it deliberately and would not release  her as she started back. \"He's the law. The edict went forth to ruin me.  Well, look at me! It'll now go forth to compel you to the will of the  Church.\"    \"You wrong Bishop Dyer. Tull is hard, I know. But then he has been in  love with me for years.\"    \"Oh, your faith and your excuses! You can't see what I know--and if you  did see it you'd not admit it to save your life. That's the Mormon  of you. These elders and bishops will do absolutely any deed to go on  building up the power and wealth of their church, their empire. Think  of what they've done to the Gentiles here, to me--think of Milly Erne's  fate!\"    \"What do you know of her story?\"    \"I know enough--all, perhaps, except the name of the Mormon who brought  her here. But I must stop this kind of talk.\"    She pressed his hand in response. He helped her to a seat beside him  on the bench. And he respected a silence that he divined was full of  woman's deep emotion beyond his understanding.    It was the moment when the last ruddy rays of the sunset brightened  momentarily before yielding to twilight. And for Venters the outlook  before him was in some sense similar to a feeling of his future, and  with searching eyes he studied the beautiful purple, barren waste of  sage. Here was the unknown and the perilous. The whole scene impressed  Venters as a wild, austere, and mighty manifestation of nature. And  as it somehow reminded him of his prospect in life, so it suddenly  resembled the woman near him, only in her there were greater beauty and  peril, a mystery more unsolvable, and something nameless that numbed his  heart and dimmed his eye.    \"Look! A rider!\" exclaimed Jane, breaking the silence. \"Can that be  Lassiter?\"    Venters moved his glance once more to the west. A horseman showed dark  on the sky-line, then merged into the color of the sage.    \"It might be. But I think not--that fellow was coming in. One of your  riders, more likely. Yes, I see him clearly now. And there's another.\"    \"I see them, too.\"    \"Jane, your riders seem as many as the bunches of sage. I ran into five  yesterday 'way down near the trail to Deception Pass. They were with the  white herd.\"    \"You still go to that canyon? Bern, I wish you wouldn't. Oldring and his  rustlers live somewhere down there.\"    \"Well, what of that?\"    \"Tull has already hinted to your frequent trips into Deception Pass.\"    \"I know.\" Venters uttered a short laugh. \"He'll make a rustler of me  next. But, Jane, there's no water for fifty miles after I leave here,  and the nearest is in the canyon. I must drink and water my horse.  There! I see more riders. They are going out.\"    \"The red herd is on the slope, toward the Pass.\"    Twilight was fast falling. A group of horsemen crossed the dark line  of low ground to become more distinct as they climbed the slope. The  silence broke to a clear call from an incoming rider, and, almost like  the peal of a hunting-horn, floated back the answer. The outgoing riders  moved swiftly, came sharply into sight as they topped a ridge to show  wild and black above the horizon, and then passed down, dimming into the  purple of the sage.    \"I hope they don't meet Lassiter,\" said Jane.    \"So do I,\" replied Venters. \"By this time the riders of the night shift  know what happened to-day. But Lassiter will likely keep out of their  way.\"    \"Bern, who is Lassiter? He's only a name to me--a terrible name.\"    \"Who is he? I don't know, Jane. Nobody I ever met knows him. He talks a  little like a Texan, like Milly Erne. Did you note that?\"    \"Yes. How strange of him to know of her! And she lived here ten years  and has been dead two. Bern, what do you know of Lassiter? Tell me what  he has done--why you spoke of him to Tull--threatening to become another  Lassiter yourself?\"    \"Jane, I only heard things, rumors, stories, most of which I  disbelieved. At Glaze his name was known, but none of the riders or  ranchers I knew there ever met him. At Stone Bridge I never heard him  mentioned. But at Sterling and villages north of there he was spoken of  often. I've never been in a village which he had been known to visit.  There were many conflicting stories about him and his doings. Some said  he had shot up this and that Mormon village, and others denied it. I'm  inclined to believe he has, and you know how Mormons hide the truth. But  there was one feature about Lassiter upon which all agree--that he was  what riders in this country call a gun-man. He's a man with a marvelous  quickness and accuracy in the use of a Colt. And now that I've seen him  I know more. Lassiter was born without fear. I watched him with eyes  which saw him my friend. I'll never forget the moment I recognized him  from what had been told me of his crouch before the draw. It was then I  yelled his name. I believe that yell saved Tull's life. At any rate, I  know this, between Tull and death then there was not the breadth of the  littlest hair. If he or any of his men had moved a finger downward--\"    Venters left his meaning unspoken, but at the suggestion Jane shuddered.    The pale afterglow in the west darkened with the merging of twilight  into night. The sage now spread out black and gloomy. One dim star  glimmered in the southwest sky. The sound of trotting horses had  ceased, and there was silence broken only by a faint, dry pattering of  cottonwood leaves in the soft night wind.    Into this peace and calm suddenly broke the high-keyed yelp of a coyote,  and from far off in the darkness came the faint answering note of a  trailing mate.    \"Hello! the sage-dogs are barking,\" said Venters.    \"I don't like to hear them,\" replied Jane. \"At night, sometimes when I  lie awake, listening to the long mourn or breaking bark or wild howl, I  think of you asleep somewhere in the sage, and my heart aches.\"    \"Jane, you couldn't listen to sweeter music, nor could I have a better  bed.\"    \"Just think! Men like Lassiter and you have no home, no comfort, no  rest, no place to lay your weary heads. Well!... Let us be patient.  Tull's anger may cool, and time may help us. You might do some service  to the village--who can tell? Suppose you discovered the long-unknown  hiding-place of Oldring and his band, and told it to my riders? That  would disarm Tull's ugly hints and put you in favor. For years my riders  have trailed the tracks of stolen cattle. You know as well as I how  dearly we've paid for our ranges in this wild country. Oldring drives  our cattle down into the network of deceiving canyons, and somewhere far  to the north or east he drives them up and out to Utah markets. If you  will spend time in Deception Pass try to find the trails.\"    \"Jane, I've thought of that. I'll try.\"    \"I must go now. And it hurts, for now I'll never be sure of seeing you  again. But to-morrow, Bern?\"    \"To-morrow surely. I'll watch for Lassiter and ride in with him.\"    \"Good night.\"    Then she left him and moved away, a white, gliding shape that soon  vanished in the shadows.    Venters waited until the faint slam of a door assured him she had  reached the house, and then, taking up his rifle, he noiselessly slipped  through the bushes, down the knoll, and on under the dark trees to the  edge of the grove. The sky was now turning from gray to blue; stars had  begun to lighten the earlier blackness; and from the wide flat sweep  before him blew a cool wind, fragrant with the breath of sage. Keeping  close to the edge of the cottonwoods, he went swiftly and silently  westward. The grove was long, and he had not reached the end when he  heard something that brought him to a halt. Low padded thuds told  him horses were coming this way. He sank down in the gloom, waiting,  listening. Much before he had expected, judging from sound, to his  amazement he descried horsemen near at hand. They were riding along the  border of the sage, and instantly he knew the hoofs of the horses were  muffled. Then the pale starlight afforded him indistinct sight of the  riders. But his eyes were keen and used to the dark, and by peering  closely he recognized the huge bulk and black-bearded visage of Oldring  and the lithe, supple form of the rustler's lieutenant, a masked rider.  They passed on; the darkness swallowed them. Then, farther out on the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#4)"],[1," from the Arctic to the Antarctic, but not  till about 1553 did the scholars and adventurers of England show  themselves fully alive to the gigantic importance of this New World.  Between 1530 and 1553 their attention was distracted from geography  and over-sea adventure by the religious troubles of the Reformation.]    The Portuguese monarchy had begun to take possession of the Azores  archipelago from the year 1432. These islands were probably known to  the Phoenicians, and even to the Arabs of the Middle Ages; between the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries they had been rediscovered by  Catalans, Genoese, Flemings, and Portuguese; and after 1444 the Azores  began to prove very useful to the sea adventurers of this wonderful  fifteenth century, as they became a shelter and a place of call for  fresh water and provisions almost in the middle of the Atlantic, 800  to 1000 miles due west of Portugal. Portuguese vessels sailed  northwards from the Azores in search of fishing grounds, and thus  reached Iceland, which they called Terra do Bacalhao.[10] They may  even before Cabot have visited in an unrecorded fashion the wonderful  banks of Newfoundland--an immense area of shallow sea swarming with  codfish.    [Footnote 10: _Bacalhao_ in Portuguese (and a similar word in Spanish,  old French, and Italian) means dried, salted fish. It comes from a  Latin word meaning \"a small stick\", because the fish were split open  and held up flat to dry by means of a cross or framework of small  sticks, the Norse name \"stokfiske\" meant the same: stockfish or  stickfish.]    As soon as the news of the Cabot voyages reached the King of Portugal  he arranged to send an expedition of discovery to the far north-west,  perhaps to find a northern sea route to Eastern Asia. He gave the  command to Gaspar Corte-Real, a Portuguese noble connected through  family property with the Azores. Starting from the Azores in the  summer of 1500, Corte-Real discovered Newfoundland, and called it  \"Terra Verde\" from its dense woods of fir trees, which are now being  churned into wood pulp to make paper for British books and newspapers.  He then sailed along the coast of Labrador,[11] and thence crossed  over to Greenland, the southern half of which he mapped with fair  accuracy. His records of this voyage take particular note of the great  icebergs off the coast of Greenland. His men were surprised to find  that sea water frozen becomes perfectly fresh--all the salt is left  out in the process. So that his two ships could supply themselves  with fresh water of the purest, by hacking ice from the masses  floating in these Greenland summer seas. The next year he started  again, but on a more westerly course. His two ships reached the coasts  of New Jersey and Massachusetts, and sailed north once more to  Labrador. They captured a number of Amerindian aborigines, but only  one of the two ships (with seven of these savages on board) reached  Portugal; Gaspar Corte-Real was never heard of again. His brother  Miguel went out in search of him, but he likewise disappeared without  a trace.    [Footnote 11: _Labrador_ (_Lavrador_ in Portuguese) means a labourer,  a serf. The Portuguese are supposed to have brought some Red Indians  from this coast to be sold as slaves.]    Nevertheless these Portuguese expeditions to North America have left  ineffaceable traces in the geography of the Newfoundland coast, of  which (under the name of Terra Nova[12]) the governorship was made  hereditary in the Corte-Real family. Cape Race for example--the most  prominent point of the island--is really the Portuguese _Cabo  Raso_--the bare or \"shaved\" cape--and this was by the Spaniards  regarded as the westernmost limit of Portuguese sovereignty in that  direction. For the Spaniards were by no means pleased at the intrusion  of other nations into a New World which they desired to monopolize  entirely for the Spanish Crown. They did not so much mind sharing it,  along the line agreed upon in the Treaty of Tordesillas, with the  Portuguese, but the ingress of the English and French infuriated them.  The Basque people of the north-east corner of Spain were a hardy  seafaring folk, especially bold in the pursuit of whales in the Bay of  Biscay, and eager to take a share in the salt-fish trade. This desire  took them in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to Ireland and  Iceland. They began to fish off the Newfoundland coasts perhaps as  early as 1525. About this time also the Emperor Charles V, King of  Spain, having through one great Portuguese sea captain--Magalhaes  (Magellan)--discovered the passage from Atlantic to Pacific across  the extremity of South America, thought by employing another  Portuguese--Estevao Gomez--to find a similar sea route through North  America, which would prove a short cut from Europe to China. This was  the famous \"North-west Passage\" the search for which drew so many  great and brave adventurers into the Arctic sea of America between  1500 and 1853, to be revealed at last by our fellow countrymen, but to  prove useless to navigation on account of the enormous accumulation of  ice.    [Footnote 12: Corte-Real's name of Terra Verde (\"Greenland\") was soon  dropped in favour of the older English name \"New Land\" (Newfoundland,  Terra Nova). This was at once adopted by the French seamen as \"Terre  Neuve\".]    Gomez left Corunna in the winter of 1524-5, and reached the  North-American coast somewhere about Florida. He probably only began  to investigate closely after he passed into the broad gulf of Maine,  between Cape Cod and Nova Scotia. Here he sighted from the sea the  lofty mountains of New Hampshire, and steered for the mouth of the  Penobscot River (which he named the River of Deer), a title which  sticks to the locality--in Deer Island--at the present day. But this  being no opening of a broad strait, he passed on into the Bay of Fundy  (from Portuguese word, _Fundo_, the bottom of a sack or passage),  explored its two terminal gulfs, then returned along the coast of Nova  Scotia,[13] past Cape Sable, and so to the \"gut\" or Canal of Canso.  Gomez realized that Cape Breton was an island (we now know that it is  two islands separated by a narrow watercourse), but thought that Cabot  Strait was a great bay, and guessed nothing of the Gulf of St.  Lawrence, and the chance of securing for Spain the possession of this  mighty waterway into the heart of North America.    [Footnote 13: The name Nova Scotia was not applied to this peninsula  until 1621, by the British Government. It was at first included with  New Brunswick under the Spanish name of Norumbega, and after 1603 was  called by the French \"Acadie\".]    From Cape North he crossed over to the south coast of Newfoundland,  and followed this more or less till he came to Cape Race. Newfoundland  was a \"very cold and savage land\", and Gomez decided it was no use  prosecuting any farther his enquiry as to a water passage across North  America, because, if it existed, it must lie in latitudes of frozen  sea and be unnavigable.    At different places along the east coast of North America he kidnapped  natives, and eventually returned to Spain (via Florida and Cuba) with  a cargo of Amerindian slaves.    He had been preceded, by seven or eight months, in his explorations  along the same coast by GIOVANNI DA VERRAZANO, a native of Florence,  who as a navigator and explorer had visited the East, and had  associated himself a good deal with the shipowners of Dieppe. Ever  since the issue of Cabot's voyages was known--at any rate from  1504--ships from Brittany and Normandy had made their way to Cape  Breton Island and Newfoundland for the cod fisheries. In 1508 a Norman  named Aubert was sent out by Jean Ango--a great merchant of Dieppe of  that day--to found a colony in Newfoundland. Aubert failed to do this,  but he captured and brought away at least seven of the natives, no  doubt of the Beothik tribe, from Newfoundland to Rouen, with their  canoe, clothing, and weapons. A good many ships also went out from La  Rochelle on the west coast of France, and took part in the fishing off  the coast of Newfoundland: together with the ships of Brittany and  Dieppe there may have been a French fishing fleet of seventy to eighty  ships plying every summer season between France, Newfoundland, and  Cape Breton. So that when \"John from Verrazano\" offered his services  to Francis I to make discoveries across the ocean, which should become  possessions of the French Crown, he was quickly provided with the  requisite funds and ships.    Verrazano started on the 17th of January, 1524, for the coast of  North America, but I shall say little about his expedition here,  because it resulted chiefly in the discovery and mapping of what is  now the east coast of the United States. He reached as far as the  south coast of Newfoundland, it is true; he also gave the names of  Nova Gallia and Francesca to the coast regions of eastern North  America, and distinctly intended to take possession of these on behalf  of the French Crown. But his work in this direction did not lead  directly to the creation of the French colony of Canada, because, when  he returned from America, Francis I was at war with Spain, and could  pay no attention to Verrazano's projects. His voyage is worth  recording in the present volume only for these two reasons: he  certainly put it into the minds of French people that they might found  an empire in North America; and he inspired geographers for another  hundred years with the false idea that the great North American  Continent had a very narrow waist, like the Isthmus of Panama, and  that the Pacific Ocean covered the greater part of what is now called  the United States. This mistake arose from his looking across the  narrow belts or peninsulas of sand in North Carolina and Virginia, and  seeing vast stretches of open water to the west. These were found, a  hundred years afterwards, to be merely"]]]
