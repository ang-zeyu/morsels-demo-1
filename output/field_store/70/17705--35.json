The meagre grant of the Commons  had by no means put an end to his financial distresses. It was to be  feared that his services were not appreciated by the nation. His debts  continued to grow. For many years he had lived upon L7000 a year;  but now his expenses were exactly doubled; he could make no further  reductions; as it was, there was not a single servant in his meagre  grant establishment who was idle for a moment from morning to night. He  poured out his griefs in a long letter to Robert Owen, whose sympathy  had the great merit of being practical. \"I now candidly state,\" he  wrote, \"that, after viewing the subject in every possible way, I am  satisfied that, to continue to live in England, even in the quiet way  in which we are going on, WITHOUT SPLENDOUR, and WITHOUT SHOW, NOTHING  SHORT OF DOUBLING THE SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS WILL DO, REDUCTION BEING  IMPOSSIBLE.\" It was clear that he would be obliged to sell his house for  L51,300, if that failed, he would go and live on the Continent. \"If my  services are useful to my country, it surely becomes THOSE WHO HAVE THE  POWER to support me in substantiating those just claims I have for the  very extensive losses and privations I have experienced, during the very  long period of my professional servitude in the Colonies; and if this  is not attainable, IT IS A CLEAR PROOF TO ME THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE NOT  APPRECIATED; and under that impression I shall not scruple, in DUE time,  to resume my retirement abroad, when the Duchess and myself shall have  fulfilled our duties in establishing the ENGLISH birth of my child, and  giving it material nutriment on the soil of Old England; and which we  shall certainly repeat, if Providence destines, to give us any further  increase of family.\"    In the meantime, he decided to spend the winter at Sidmouth, \"in order,\"  he told Owen, \"that the Duchess may have the benefit of tepid  sea bathing, and our infant that of sea air, on the fine coast of  Devonshire, during the months of the year that are so odious in London.\"  In December the move was made. With the new year, the Duke remembered  another prophecy. In 1820, a fortune-teller had told him, two members  of the Royal Family would die. Who would they be? He speculated on  the various possibilities: The King, it was plain, could not live much  longer; and the Duchess of York had been attacked by a mortal disease.  Probably it would be the King and the Duchess of York; or perhaps the  King and the Duke of York; or the King and the Regent. He himself was  one of the healthiest men in England. \"My brothers,\" he declared, \"are  not so strong as I am; I have lived a regular life. I shall outlive them  all. The crown will come to me and my children.\" He went out for a  walk, and got his feet wet. On coming home, he neglected to change his  stockings. He caught cold, inflammation of the lungs set in, and on  January 22 he was a dying man. By a curious chance, young Dr. Stockmar  was staying in the house at the time; two years before, he had stood  by the death-bed of the Princess Charlotte; and now he was watching  the Duke of Kent in his agony. On Stockmar's advice, a will was hastily  prepared. The Duke's earthly possessions were of a negative character;  but it was important that the guardianship of the unwitting child,  whose fortunes were now so strangely changing, should be assured to  the Duchess. The Duke was just able to understand the document, and to  append his signature. Having inquired whether his writing was perfectly  clear, he became unconscious, and breathed his last on the following  morning! Six days later came the fulfilment of the second half of the  gipsy's prophecy. The long, unhappy, and inglorious life of George the  Third of England was ended.    II    Such was the confusion of affairs at Sidmouth, that the Duchess found  herself without the means of returning to London. Prince Leopold hurried  down, and himself conducted his sister and her family, by slow and  bitter stages, to Kensington. The widowed lady, in her voluminous  blacks, needed all her equanimity to support her. Her prospects were  more dubious than ever. She had L6000 a year of her own; but her  husband's debts loomed before her like a mountain. Soon she learnt that  the Duchess of Clarence was once more expecting a child. What had she to  look forward to in England? Why should she remain in a foreign country,  among strangers, whose language she could not speak, whose customs she  could not understand? Surely it would be best to return to Amorbach,  and there, among her own people, bring up her daughters in economical  obscurity. But she was an inveterate optimist; she had spent her life  in struggles, and would not be daunted now; and besides, she adored her  baby. \"C'est mon bonheur, mes delices, mon existence,\" she declared;  the darling should be brought up as an English princess, whatever lot  awaited her. Prince Leopold came forward nobly with an offer of an  additional L3000 a year; and the Duchess remained at Kensington.    The child herself was extremely fat, and bore a remarkable resemblance  to her grandfather. \"C'est l'image du feu Roi!\" exclaimed the Duchess.  \"C'est le Roi Georges en jupons,\" echoed the surrounding ladies, as the  little creature waddled with difficulty from one to the other.    Before long, the world began to be slightly interested in the nursery at  Kensington. When, early in 1821, the Duchess of Clarence's second child,  the Princess Elizabeth, died within three months of its birth, the  interest increased. Great forces and fierce antagonisms seemed to be  moving, obscurely, about the royal cradle. It was a time of faction  and anger, of violent repression and profound discontent. A powerful  movement, which had for long been checked by adverse circumstances, was  now spreading throughout the country. New passions, new desires, were  abroad; or rather old passions and old desires, reincarnated with a new  potency: love of freedom, hatred of injustice, hope for the future  of man. The mighty still sat proudly in their seats, dispensing their  ancient tyranny; but a storm was gathering out of the darkness, and  already there was lightning in the sky. But the vastest forces must  needs operate through frail human instruments; and it seemed for many  years as if the great cause of English liberalism hung upon the life of  the little girl at Kensington. She alone stood between the country and  her terrible uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, the hideous embodiment of  reaction. Inevitably, the Duchess of Kent threw in her lot with her  husband's party; Whig leaders, Radical agitators, rallied round her; she  was intimate with the bold Lord Durham, she was on friendly terms with  the redoubtable O'Connell himself. She received Wilberforce-though, to  be sure, she did not ask him to sit down. She declared in public that  she put her faith in \"the liberties of the People.\" It was certain that  the young Princess would be brought up in the way that she should go;  yet there, close behind the throne, waiting, sinister, was the Duke of  Cumberland. Brougham, looking forward into the future in his scurrilous  fashion, hinted at dreadful possibilities. \"I never prayed so heartily  for a Prince before,\" he wrote, on hearing that George IV had been  attacked by illness. \"If he had gone, all the troubles of these villains  (the Tory Ministers) went with him, and they had Fred. I (the Duke of  York) their own man for his life. He (Fred. I) won't live long either;  that Prince of Blackguards, 'Brother William,' is as bad a life, so  we come in the course of nature to be ASSASSINATED by King Ernest I or  Regent Ernest (the Duke of Cumberland).\" Such thoughts were not peculiar  to Brougham; in the seething state of public feeling, they constantly  leapt to the surface; and, even so late as the year previous to her  accession, the Radical newspapers were full of suggestions that the  Princess Victoria was in danger from the machinations of her wicked  uncle.    But no echo of these conflicts and forebodings reached the little  Drina--for so she was called in the family circle--as she played with  her dolls, or scampered down the passages, or rode on the donkey her  uncle York had given her along the avenues of Kensington Gardens  The fair-haired, blue-eyed child was idolised by her nurses, and her  mother's ladies, and her sister Feodora; and for a few years there was  danger, in spite of her mother's strictness, of her being spoilt. From  time to time, she would fly into a violent passion, stamp her little  foot, and set everyone at defiance; whatever they might say, she would  not learn her letters--no, she WOULD NOT; afterwards, she was very  sorry, and burst into tears; but her letters remained unlearnt. When  she was five years old, however, a change came, with the appearance  of Fraulein Lehzen. This lady, who was the daughter of a Hanoverian  clergyman, and had previously been the Princess Feodora's governess,  soon succeeded in instilling a new spirit into her charge. At first,  indeed, she was appalled by the little Princess's outbursts of temper;  never in her life, she declared, had she seen such a passionate  and naughty child. Then she observed something else; the child was  extraordinarily truthful; whatever punishment might follow, she never  told a lie. Firm, very firm, the new governess yet had the sense to see  that all the firmness in the world would be useless, unless she could  win her way into little Drina's heart. She did so, and there were no  more difficulties. Drina learnt her letters like an angel; and she  learnt other things as well. The Baroness de Spath taught her how  to make little board boxes and decorate them with tinsel and painted  flowers; her mother taught her religion.

These can be easily  repaired by inserting in the neck a piece of match, toothpick or  splinter of wood and tying the hanging string to it.    [Illustration: Repaired Decoration]        ** Homemade Scroll Saw [11]    A scroll saw, if once used, becomes indispensable in any home  carpenter chest, yet it is safe to say that not one in ten  contains it. A scroll saw is much more useful than a keyhole saw  for sawing small and irregular holes, and many fancy knick-knacks,  such as brackets, bookracks and shelves can be made with one.    A simple yet serviceable scroll saw frame can be made from a piece  of cold-rolled steel rod, 3/32 or 1/4 in. in diameter, two 1/8-in.  machine screws, four washers and four square nuts. The rod should  be 36 or 38 in. long, bent as shown in Fig. 1. Place one washer on  each screw and put the screws through the eyelets, AA, then place  other washers on and fasten in place by screwing one nut on each  screw, clamping the washers against the frame as tightly as  possible. The saw, which can be purchased at a local hardware  store, is fastened between the clamping nut and another nut as  shown in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: Frame Made of a Rod]    If two wing nuts having the same number and size of threads are  available, use them in place of the outside nuts. They are easier  to turn when inserting a saw blade in a hole or when removing  broken blades.  --Contributed by W. A.

Silver is the most desirable but,  of course, the most expensive. The buckle is to be purchased. The  connection is to be of leather of a color to harmonize with that  of the fixtures. The body of the fob may be of leather of suitable  color or of silk. Of the leathers, green and browns are the most  popular, though almost any color may be obtained.    Make full size drawings of the outline and design of the fixtures.  With carbon paper trace these on the metal. Pierce the metal of  the parts that are to be removed with a small hand drill to make a  place for the leather or silk. With a small metal saw cut out  these parts and smooth up the edges, rounding them slightly so  they will not cut the leather or silk. Next cut out the outlines  with the metal shears. File these edges, rounding and smoothing  with emery paper. The best way of handling the decorative design  is to etch it and, if copper or brass, treat it with color.    For etching, first cover the metal with black asphaltum varnish,  on the back and all the parts that are not to be touched with the  acid. In the design shown, the unshaded parts should not be etched  and should, therefore, be covered the same as the back. Apply two  coats, allowing each time to dry, after which immerse the metal in  a solution prepared as follows: 3 parts water, 1 part nitric acid,  1 part sulphuric acid. Allow the metal to remain in this until the  acid has eaten to a depth of 1/32 in., then remove it and clean in  a turpentine bath, using a swab and an old stiff brush. The amount  of time required to do the etching will depend upon the strength  of the liquid, as well as the depth of etching desired.    [Illustration: Watch Fob]    For coloring silver, as well as brass and copper, cover the metal  with a solution of the following: 1/2 pt. of water in which  dissolve, after breaking up, five cents worth of sulphureted  potassium. Put a teaspoonful of this into a tin with 2 qt. of  water. Polish a piece of scrap metal and dip it in the solution.  If it colors the metal red, it has the correct strength. Drying  will cause this to change to purple. Rub off the highlights,  leaving them the natural color of the metal and apply a coat of  banana-oil lacquer.        ** An Austrian Top [12]    All parts of the top are of wood and they are simple to make. The  handle is a piece of pine, 5-1/4 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide and 3/4  in. thick. A handle, 3/4 in. in diameter, is formed on one end,  allowing only 1-1/4 in. of the other end to remain rectangular in  shape. Bore a 3/4-in. hole in this end for the top. A 1/16-in.  hole is bored in the edge to enter the large hole as shown. The  top can be cut from a broom handle or a round stick of hardwood.    [Illustration: Parts of the Top]    To spin the top, take a piece of stout cord about 2 ft. long, pass  one end through the 1/16-in. hole and wind it on the small part of  the top in the usual way, starting at the bottom and winding  upward. When the shank is covered, set the top in the 3/4-in.  hole. Take hold of the handle with the left hand and the end of  the cord with the right hand, give a good quick pull on the cord  and the top will jump clear of the handle and spin vigorously.  --Contributed by J.F.

The dimensions may be varied to admit any number or size  of spools. Each pocket is made to take a certain size spool, the  end of the thread being run through the cloth front for obtaining  the length for threading a needle. This will keep the thread from  becoming tangled and enable it always to be readily drawn out to  the required length.  --Contributed by Miss L. Alberta Norrell, Augusta, Ga.    [Illustration: Pockets for Thread]        ** Cleaning Leather on Furniture [13]    Beat up the whites of three eggs carefully and use a piece of  flannel to rub it well into the leather which will become clean  and lustrous. For black leathers, some lampblack may be added and  the mixture applied in the same way.        ** A Baking Pan [13]    When making cookies, tarts or similar pastry, the housewife often  wishes for something by which to lift the baked articles from the  pan. The baking tray or pan shown in the sketch not only protects  the hands from burns but allows the baked articles easily to slip  from its surface. The pan is made from a piece of sheet iron  slightly larger than the baking space desired. Each end of the  metal is cut so that a part may be turned up and into a roll to  make handles for the pan.    [Illustration: Baking Pan without Sides]    A wire or small rod is placed between the handles as shown. This  wire is fastened at each end and a loop made in the center. The  pan can be removed from the oven by placing a stick through the  loop and lifting it out without placing the hands inside the hot  oven. The baking surface, having no sides, permits the baked  articles to be slid off at each side with a knife or fork. --A. A.  Houghton, Northville, Mich.        ** A Broom Holder [13]    [Illustration: Broom Holder]    A very simple and effective device for holding a broom when it is  not in use is shown in the sketch. It is made of heavy wire and  fastened to the wall with two screw eyes, the eyes forming  bearings for the wire. The small turn on the end of the straight  part is to hold the hook out far enough from the wall to make it  easy to place the broom in the hook. The weight of the broom keeps  it in position.  --Contributed by Irl Hicks, Centralia, Mo.        **Stringing Wires [13]    A string for drawing electric wires into bent fixtures can be  easily inserted by rolling it into a small ball and blowing it  through while holding one end.        ** A Darkroom Lantern [14]    Procure an ordinary 2-qt. glass fruit jar, break out the porcelain  lining in the cover and cut a hole through the metal, just large  enough to fit over the socket of an incandescent electric globe,  then solder cover and socket together, says Studio Light. Line the  inside of the jar with two thicknesses of good orange post office  paper. The best lamp for the purpose is an 8-candlepower showcase  lamp, the same as shown in the illustration. Screw the lamp into  the socket and screw the cover onto the jar, and you have a safe  light of excellent illuminating power.    When you desire to work by white light, two turns will remove the  jar.    [Illustration: Darkroom Lantern]    If developing papers are being worked, obtain a second jar and  line with light orange paper, screw into the cover fastened to the  lamp and you have a safe and pleasant light for loading and  development. By attaching sufficient cord to the lamp, it can be  moved to any part of the darkroom, and you have three lamps at a  trifling cost.        ** Preventing Vegetables from Burning in a Pot [14]    Many housekeepers do not know that there is a simple way to  prevent potatoes from burning and sticking to the bottom of the  pot. An inverted pie pan placed in the bottom of the pot avoids  scorching potatoes. The water and empty space beneath the pan  saves the potatoes. This also makes the work of cleaning pots  easier as no adhering parts of potatoes are left to be scoured  out.        ** A Clothes Rack [14]    A clothes-drying rack that has many good features can be made as  shown in the illustration. When the rack is    [Illustration: Folding Clothes Rack]    closed it will fit into a very small space and one or more wings  can be used at a time as the occasion or space permits, and not  tip over. The rack can be made of any hard wood and the material  list is as follows:    1 Center post. 1-1/4 in. square by 62 in. 4 Braces. 1-1/4 in.  square by 12 in. 16 Horizontal bars. 1 by 1-1/4 by 24 in. 4  Vertical pieces. 1/4 by 1 by 65 in.    Attach the four braces for the feet with finishing nails after  applying a good coat of glue.    The horizontal bars are fastened to the vertical pieces with  rivets using washers on both sides. The holes are bored a little  large "]]]
