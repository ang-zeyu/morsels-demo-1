To a man who, like Bismarck, was  accustomed to the truer freedom of the country, it was only a passing  phase; as we shall see, it was not easy to tie him down to the drudgery  of an office. He did not even form many friendships which he continued  in later years; his associates in his corps must have been chiefly young  Hanoverians; few of his comrades in Prussia were to be found at  Goettingen; his knowledge of English enabled him to make the  acquaintance of the Americans and English with whom Goettingen has always  been a favourite university; among his fellow-students almost the only  one with whom in after life he continued the intimacy of younger days  was Motley. We hear little of his work; none of the professors seem to  have left any marked influence on his mind or character; indeed they had  little opportunity for doing so, for after the first term his attendance  at lectures almost entirely ceased. Though never a student, he must have  been at all times a considerable reader; he had a retentive memory and  quick understanding; he read what interested him; absorbed, understood,  and retained it. He left the university with his mind disciplined indeed  but not drilled; he had a considerable knowledge of languages, law,  literature, and history; he had not subjected his mind to the dominion  of the dominant Hegelian philosophy, and to this we must attribute that  freshness and energy which distinguishes him from so many of his ablest  contemporaries; his brain was strong, and it worked as easily and as  naturally as his body; his knowledge was more that of a man of the world  than of a student, but in later life he was always able to understand  the methods and to acquire the knowledge of the subjects he required in  his official career. History was his favourite study; he never  attempted, like some statesmen, to write; but if his knowledge of  history was not as profound as that of a professed historian, he was  afterwards to shew as a parliamentary debater that he had a truer  perception of the importance of events than many great scholars who  have devoted their lives to historical research, and he was never at a  loss for an illustration to explain and justify the policy he had  assumed. For natural science he shewed little interest, and indeed at  that time it scarcely could be reckoned among the ordinary subjects of  education; philosophy he pursued rather as a man than as a student, and  we are not surprised to find that it was Spinoza rather than Kant or  Fichte or Hegel to whom he devoted most attention, for he cared more for  principles of belief and the conduct of life than the analysis of the  intellect.    His university career does not seem to have left any mark on his  political principles; during just those years, the agitation of which  the universities had long been the scene had been forcibly repressed; it  was the time of deep depression which followed the revolution of 1830,  and the members of the aristocratic corps to which he belonged looked  with something approaching contempt on this _Burschenschaft_, as the  union was called, which propagated among the students the national  enthusiasm.    After spending little more than a year at Goettingen, he left in  September, 1833; in May of the following year he entered as a student at  Berlin, where he completed his university course; we have no record as  to the manner in which he spent the winter and early spring, but we find  that when he applied to Goettingen for permission to enter at Berlin, it  was accorded on condition that he sat out a term of imprisonment which  he still owed to the university authorities. During part of his time in  Berlin he shared a room with Motley. In order to prepare for the final  examination he engaged the services of a crammer, and with his  assistance, in 1835, took the degree of Doctor of Law and at once passed  on to the public service.    He had, as we have seen, been destined for the Diplomatic Service from  early life; he was well connected; his cousin Count Bismarck-Bohlen  stood in high favour at Court. He was related to or acquainted with all  the families who held the chief posts both in the military and civil  service; with his great talents and social gifts he might therefore look  forward to a brilliant career. Any hopes, however, that his mother might  have had were destined to be disappointed; his early official life was  varied but short. He began in the judicial department and was appointed  to the office of Auscultator at Berlin, for in the German system the  judicature is one department of the Civil Service. After a year he was  at his own request transferred to the administrative side and to  Aix-la-Chapelle; it is said that he had been extremely pained and  shocked by the manner in which the officials transacted the duties of  their office and especially by their management of the divorce matters  which came before the court. The choice of Aix-la-Chapelle was probably  owing to the fact that the president of that province was Count Arnim of  Boytzenburg, the head of one of the most numerous and distinguished  families of the Mark, with so many members of which Bismarck was in  later years to be connected both for good and evil. Count Arnim was a  man of considerable ability and moderate liberal opinions, who a few  years later rose to be the first Minister-President in Prussia. Under  him Bismarck was sure to receive every assistance. He had to pass a  fresh examination, which he did with great success. His certificate  states that he shewed thoroughly good school studies, and was well  grounded in law; he had thought over what he had learnt and already had  acquired independent opinions. He had admirable judgment, quickness in  understanding, and a readiness in giving verbal answers to the questions  laid before him; we see all the qualities by which he was to be  distinguished in after life. He entered on his duties at Aix-la-Chapelle  at the beginning of June; at his own request Count Arnim wrote to the  heads of the department that as young Bismarck was destined for a  diplomatic career they were to afford him every opportunity of becoming  acquainted with all the different sides of the administrative work and  give him more work than they otherwise would have done; he was to be  constantly occupied. His good resolutions did not, however, continue  long; he found himself in a fashionable watering-place, his knowledge of  languages enabled him to associate with the French and English visitors,  he made excursions to Belgium and the Rhine, and hunting expeditions to  the Ardennes, and gave up to society the time he ought to have spent in  the office. The life at Aix was not strict and perhaps his amusements  were not always edifying, but he acquired that complete ease in  cosmopolitan society which he could not learn at Goettingen or Berlin,  and his experiences during this year were not without use to him when  he was afterwards placed in the somewhat similar society of Frankfort.  This period in his career did not last long; in June, 1837, we find him  applying for leave of absence on account of ill-health. He received  leave for eight days, but he seems to have exceeded this, for four  months afterwards he writes from Berne asking that his leave may be  prolonged; he had apparently gone off for a long tour in Switzerland and  the Rhine. His request was refused; he received a severe reprimand, and  Count Arnim approved his resolution to return to one of the older  Prussian provinces, \"where he might shew an activity in the duties of  his office which he had in vain attempted to attain in the social  conditions of Aachen.\"    He was transferred to Potsdam, but he remained here only a few weeks; he  had not as yet served in the army, and he now began the year as a  private soldier which was required from him; he entered the Jaeger or  Rifles in the _Garde Corps_ which was stationed at Potsdam, but after a  few weeks was transferred to the Jaeger at Stettin. The cause seems to  have been partly the ill-health of his mother; she was dying, and he  wished to be near her; in those days the journey from Berlin to  Pomerania took more than a day; besides this there were pecuniary  reasons. His father's administration of the family estates had not been  successful; it is said that his mother had constantly pressed her  husband to introduce innovations, but had not consistently carried them  out; this was a not unnatural characteristic in the clever and ambitious  woman who wished to introduce into agricultural affairs those habits  which she had learnt from the bureaucrats in Berlin. However this may  be, matters had now reached a crisis; it became necessary to sell the  larger part of the land attached to the house at Schoenhausen, and in  the next year, after the death of Frau von Bismarck, which took place on  January 1, 1839, it was decided that Herr von Bismarck should in future  live at Schoenhausen with his only daughter, now a girl of twelve years  of age, while the two brothers should undertake the management of the  Pomeranian estates.    So it came about that at the age of twenty-four all prospect of an  official career had for the time to be abandoned, and Otto settled down  with his brother to the life of a country squire. It is curious to  notice that the greatest of his contemporaries, Cavour, went through a  similar training. There was, however, a great difference between the two  men: Cavour was in this as in all else a pioneer; when he retired to his  estate he was opening out new forms of activity and enterprise for his  countrymen; Bismarck after the few wild years away from home was to go  back to the life which all his ancestors had lived for five hundred  years, to become steeped in the traditions of his country and his caste.  Cavour always points the way to what is new, Bismarck again brings into  honour what men had hastily thought was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#4)"],[1,"ience, promised Tycho the first canonry that should fall vacant in the  cathedral chapter of Roskilde, so that he might be assured of an income  while devoting himself to financially unproductive work. In 1568 Tycho  left Rostock, and matriculated at Basle, but soon moved on to Augsburg,  where he found more enthusiasm for astronomy, and induced one of his new  friends to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant of heavy  oak beams. This was the first of the series of great instruments  associated with Tycho's name, and it remained in use for five years,  being destroyed by a great storm in 1574. Tycho meanwhile had left  Augsburg in 1570 and returned to live with his father, now governor of  Helsingborg Castle, until the latter's death in the following year.  Tycho then joined his mother's brother, Steen Bille, the only one of his  relatives who showed any sympathy with his desire for a scientific  career.    On 11th November, 1572, Tycho noticed an unfamiliar bright star in the  constellation of Cassiopeia, and continued to observe it with a sextant.  It was a very brilliant object, equal to Venus at its brightest for the  rest of November, not falling below the first magnitude for another four  months, and remaining visible for more than a year afterwards. Tycho  wrote a little book on the new star, maintaining that it had practically  no parallax, and therefore could not be, as some supposed, a comet.  Deeming authorship beneath the dignity of a noble he was very reluctant  to publish, but he was convinced of the importance of increasing the  number and accuracy of observations, though he was by no means free from  all the erroneous ideas of his time. The little book contained a certain  amount of astrology, but Tycho evidently did not regard this as of very  great importance. He adopted the view that the very rarity of the  phenomenon of a new star must prevent the formulation and adoption of  definite rules for determining its significance. We gather from lectures  which he was persuaded to deliver at the University of Copenhagen that,  though in agreement with the accepted canons of astrology as to the  influence of planetary conjunctions and such phenomena on the course of  human events, he did not consider the fate predicted by anyone's  horoscope to be unavoidable, but thought the great value of astrology  lay in the warnings derived from such computations, which should enable  the believer to avoid threatened calamities. In 1575 he left Denmark  once more and made his way to Cassel, where he found a kindred spirit in  the studious Landgrave, William IV. of Hesse, whose astronomical  pursuits had been interrupted by his accession to the government of  Hesse, in 1567. Tycho observed with him for some time, the two forming a  firm friendship, and then visited successively Frankfort, Basle, and  Venice, returning by way of Augsburg, Ratisbon, and Saalfeld to  Wittenberg; on the way he acquired various astronomical manuscripts,  made friends among practical astronomers, and examined new instruments.  He seemed to have considered the advantages of the several places thus  visited and decided on Basle, but on his return to Denmark to fetch his  family with the object of transferring them to Basle, he found that his  friend the Landgrave had written to King Frederick on his behalf,  urging him to provide the means to enable Tycho to pursue his  astronomical work, promising that not only should credit result for the  king and for Denmark but that science itself would be greatly advanced.  The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various  offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of  Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large  sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far  removed from the distractions of court life. Here Tycho built his  celebrated observatory of Uraniborg and began observations in December,  1576, using the large instruments then found necessary in order to  attain the accuracy of observation which within the next half-century  was to be so greatly facilitated by the invention of the telescope. Here  also he built several smaller observing rooms, so that his pupils should  be able to observe independently. For more than twenty years he  continued his observations at Uraniborg, surrounded by his family, and  attracting numerous pupils. His constant aim was to accumulate a large  store of observations of a high order of accuracy, and thus to provide  data for the complete reform of astronomy. As we have seen, few of the  Danish nobles had any sympathy with Tycho's pursuits, and most of them  strongly resented the continual expense borne by the King's treasury.  Tycho moreover was so absorbed in his scientific pursuits that he would  not take the trouble to be a good landlord, nor to carry out all the  duties laid upon him in return for certain of his grants of income. His  buildings included a chemical laboratory, and he was in the habit of  making up elixirs for various medical purposes; these were quite  popular, particularly as he made no charge for them. He seems to have  been something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulphur to cure  infectious diseases \"brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora  Borealis\"!    King Frederick, in consideration of various grants to Tycho, relied  upon his assistance in scientific matters, and especially in  astrological calculations; such as the horoscope of the heir apparent,  Prince Christian, born in 1577, which has been preserved among Tycho's  writings. There is, however, no known copy in existence of any of the  series of annual almanacs with predictions which he prepared for the  King. In November, 1577, appeared a bright comet, which Tycho carefully  observed with his sextant, proving that it had no perceptible parallax,  and must therefore be further off than the moon. He thus definitely  overthrew the common belief in the atmospheric origin of comets, which  he had himself hitherto shared. With increasing accuracy he observed  several other comets, notably one in 1585, when he had a full equipment  of instruments and a large staff of assistants. The year 1588, which saw  the death of his royal benefactor, saw also the publication of a volume  of Tycho's great work \"Introduction to the New Astronomy\". The first  volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the  reduction of the observations involved so much research to correct the  star places for refraction, precession, etc.; it was not completed in  fact until Tycho's death, but the second volume, dealing with the comet  of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588.  Besides the comet observations it included an account of Tycho's system  of the world. He would not accept the Copernican system, as he  considered the earth too heavy and sluggish to move, and also that the  authority of Scripture was against such an hypothesis. He therefore  assumed that the other planets revolved about the sun, while the sun,  moon, and stars revolved about the earth as a centre. Geometrically this  is much the same as the Copernican system, but physically it involves  the grotesque demand that the whole system of stars revolves round our  insignificant little earth every twenty-four hours. Since his previous  small book on the comet, Tycho had evidently considered more fully its  possible astrological significance, for he foretold a religious war,  giving the date of its commencement, and also the rising of a great  Protestant champion. These predictions were apparently fulfilled almost  to the letter by the great religious wars that broke out towards the end  of the sixteenth century, and in the person of Gustavus Adolphus.    King Frederick's death did not at first affect Tycho's position, for the  new king, Christian, was only eleven years old, and for some years the  council of regents included two of his supporters. After their deaths,  however, his emoluments began to be cut down on the plea of economy, and  as he took very little trouble to carry out any other than scientific  duties it was easy enough for his enemies to find fault. One after  another source of income was cut off, but he persevered with his  scientific work, including a catalogue of stars. He had obtained plenty  of good observations of 777 stars, but thought his catalogue should  contain 1000 stars, so he hastily observed as many more as he could up  to the time of his leaving Hveen, though even then he had not completed  his programme. About the time that King Christian reached the age of  eighteen, Tycho began to look about for a new patron, and to consider  the prospects offered by transferring himself with his instruments and  activities to the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II. In 1597, when  even his pension from the Royal treasury was cut off, he hurriedly  packed up his instruments and library, and after a few weeks' sojourn at  Copenhagen, proceeded to Rostock, in Mecklenburg, whence he sent an  appeal to King Christian. It is possible that had he done this before  leaving Hveen it might have had more effect, but it can be readily seen  from the tone of the king's unfavourable reply that his departure was  regarded as an aggravation of previous shortcomings. Driven from Rostock  by the plague, Tycho settled temporarily at Wandsbeck, in Holstein, but  towards the end of 1598 set out to meet the Emperor at Prague. Once  more plague intervened and he spent some time at Dresden, afterwards  going to Wittenberg for the winter. He ultimately reached Prague in  June, 1599. Rudolph granted him a salary of at least 3000 florins,  promising also to settle on him the first hereditary estate that should  lapse to the Crown. He offered, moreover, the choice between three  castles outside Prague, of which Tycho chose Benatek. There he set about  altering the buildings in readiness"]]]
