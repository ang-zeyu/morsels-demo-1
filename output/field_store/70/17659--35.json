In theoretical  investigations it may be convenient to assume both these pressures exactly  equal, and this has been done in the paper \"On Screw Propellers\" already  referred to; but this brings in an error of no importance so far as general  principles are involved, but one which destroys much of the value such  researches might, otherwise possess for those who are engaged in the  practical construction of screw propellers or turbines. The downward impact  pressure, AB, is always somewhat greater than the horizontal reaction, BC,  and any proportions between these two can only be accurately ascertained by  trials. In these particular experiments the jet of water flowed 40 ft. per  second through an orifice of 0.05 square inch area, and in every case its  course was bent to a right angle. The pressures for impact and reaction  were weighed coincidently, with results given by columns 1 and 2, Table II.

The fourth column gives the  inclination ABS, at which the line of impact must incline toward a plane  surface RS, Fig. 3, so as to produce this maximum resultant perpendicularly  upon it; as the resultant given in column 3 indicates the full practical  effect of impact and reaction. When a stream has its direction changed to  one at right angles to its original course, and as such a changed direction  is all that can be hoped for by ordinary screw propellers, the figures in  column 3 should bear some relationship to such cases. Therefore, it becomes  an inquiry of some interest as to what angle of impact has been found best  in those screw propellers which have given the best results in practical  work. Taking one of the most improved propellers made by the late Mr.  Robert Griffiths, its blades do not conform to the lines of a true screw,  but it is an oblique paddle, where the acting portions of its blades were  set at 48 deg. to the keel of the ship or 42 deg. to the plane of rotation.  Again, taking a screw tug boat on the river Thames, with blades of a  totally different form to those used by Mr. Griffiths, we still find them  set at the same angle, namely, 48 deg. to the keel or 42 deg. to the plane  of rotation. An examination of other screws tends only to confirm these  figures, and they justify the conclusion that the inclinations of blades  found out by practice ought to be arrived at, or at any rate approached, by  any sound and reliable theory; and that blades of whatever form must not  transgress far from this inclination if they are to develop any  considerable efficiency. Indeed, many favorable results obtained by  propellers are not due to their peculiarities, but only to the fact that  they have been made with an inclination of blade not far from 42 deg. to  the plan of rotation. Referring to column 4, and accepting the case of  water flowing through a smooth tube as analogous to that of a current  flowing within a large body of water, it appears that the inclination  necessary to give the highest resultant pressure is an angle of 49 deg.,  and this corresponds closely enough with the angle which practical  constructors of screw propellers have found to give the best results.  Until, therefore, we can deal with currents after they have been  discharged from the blades of a propeller, it seems unlikely that anything  can be done by alterations in the pitch of a propeller. So far as concerns  theory, the older turbines were restricted to such imperfect results of  impact and reaction as might be obtained by turning a stream at right  angles to its original course; and the more scientific of modern turbine  constructors may fairly claim credit for an innovation by which practice  gave better results than theory seemed to warrant; and the consideration of  this aspect of the question will form the concluding subject of the present  paper. Referring again to Fig. 3, when a current passes round such a curve  as the quadrant of a circle, its horizontal reaction appears as a pressure  along _c_ B, which is the result of the natural integration of all the  horizontal components of pressures, all of which act perpendicularly to  each element of the concave surface along which the current flows. If, now,  we add another quadrant of a circle to the curve, and so turn the stream  through two right angles, or 180 deg., as shown by Fig. 4, then such a  complete reversal of the original direction represents the carrying of it  back again to the highest point; it means the entire destruction of its  velocity, and it gives the maximum pressure obtainable from a jet of water  impinging upon a surface of any form whatsoever. The reaction noticed in  Fig. 3 as acting along _c_ B is now confronted by an impact of the now  horizontal stream as it is turned round the second 90 deg. of curvature,  and reacts also vertically downward. It would almost seem as if the first  reaction from B to F should be exactly neutralized by the second impact  from F to D. But such is not the case, as experiment shows an excess of the  second impact over the first reaction amounting to six units, and shows  also that the behavior of the stream through its second quadrant is  precisely similar in kind to the first, only less in degree. Also the  impact takes place vertically in one case and horizontally in the other.  The total downward pressure given by the stream when turned 180 deg. is  found by experiment thus: Total impact and reaction from 180 deg. change in  direction of current = 132 units; and by deducting the impact 71 units, as  previously measured, the new reaction corresponds with an increase of 61  units above the first impact. It also shows an increase of 37.75 units  above the greatest resultant obtained by the same stream turned through 90  deg. only. Therefore, in designing a screw propeller or turbine, it would  seem from these experiments desirable to aim at changing the direction of  the stream, so far as possible, into one at 180 deg. to its original  course, and it is by carrying out this view, so far as the necessities of  construction will permit, that the scientifically designed modern turbine  has attained to that prominence which it holds at present over all  hydraulic motors. Much more might be written to extend and amplify the  conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments described in the present  paper, and from many others made by the writer, but the exigencies of time  and your patience alike preclude further consideration of this interesting  and important subject.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED TEXTILE MACHINERY.      [Illustration: THE TEXTILE EXHIBITION, ISLINGTON.]    In the recent textile exhibition at Islington, one of the most extensive  exhibits was that, of Messrs. James Farmer and Sons, of Salford. The  exhibit consists of a Universal calender, drying machines, patent creasing,  measuring, and marking machines, and apparatus for bleaching, washing,  chloring, scouring, soaping, dunging, and dyeing woven fabrics. The purpose  of the Universal calender is, says the _Engineer_, to enable limited  quantities of goods to be finished in various ways without requiring  different machines. The machine consists of suitable framing, to which is  attached all the requisite stave rails, batching apparatus, compound  levers, top and bottom adjusting screws, and level setting down gear, also  Stanley roller with all its adjustments. It is furthermore supplied with  chasing arrangement and four bowls; the bottom one is of cast iron, with  wrought iron center; the next is of paper or cotton; the third of chilled  iron fitted for heating by steam or gas, and the top of paper or cotton. By  this machine are given such finishes as are known as \"chasing finish\" when  the thready surface is wanted; \"frictioning,\" or what is termed \"glazing  finish,\" \"swigging finish,\" and \"embossing finish;\" the later is done by  substituting a steel or copper engraved roller in place of the friction  bowl. This machine is also made to I produce the \"Moire luster\" finish. The  drying machine consists of nineteen cylinders, arranged with stave rails  and plaiting down apparatus. These cylinders are driven by bevel wheels, so  that each one is independent of its neighbor, and should any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11740"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The first approach of her lover is thus told:      He came--admired the pure and peaceful scene,    And offer'd money for our humble cot.    Oh! justly burn'd my father's cheek, I ween,    \"His sires by honest toil the dwelling got;    _Their_ home was not for sale.\" It matters not    How, after that, Lord Arthur won my love.    He smiled contemptuous on my humble lot,    Yet left no means untried my heart to move,    And call'd to witness _his_ the glorious heavens above.      Oh! dimmed are now the eyes he used to praise,    Sad is the laughing brow where hope was beaming,    The cheek that blushed at his impassioned gaze    Wan as the waters where the moon is gleaming;    For many a tear of sorrow hath been streaming    Down the changed face, which knew no care before;    And my sad heart, awakened from its dreaming,    Recalls those days of joy, untimely o'er,    And mourns remembered bliss, which can return no more.      It was upon a gentle summer's eve,    When Nature lay all silently at rest--    When none but I could find a cause to grieve,    I sought in vain to soothe my troubled breast,    And wander'd forth alone, for well I guess'd    That Arthur would be lingering in the bower    Which oft with summer garlands I had drest;    Where blamelessly I spent full many an hour    Ere yet I felt or love's or sin's remorseless power.      No joyful step to welcome me was there;    For slumber had her transient blessing sent    To him I loved--the still and balmy air,    The blue and quiet sky, repose had lent,    Deep as her own--above that form I bent,    The rich and clustering curls I gently raised,    And, trembling, kissed his brow--I turned and went--    Softly I stole away, nor, lingering, gazed;    Fearful and wondering still, at my own deed amazed.    Her first pangs of sorrow at quitting home:      \"Oh, Arthur! stay\"--he turned, and all was o'er--    My sorrow, my repentance--all was vain--    I dreamt the dream of life and love once more,    To wake to sad reality of pain.    He spoke, but to my ear no sound was plain,    Until the little wicket-gate we passed--    _That sound of home_ I never heard again,    And then \"drive on--drive faster--yet more fast.\"    I raised my weeping head--Oh! I had looked my last.    One of those precious moments in which remorse overtakes the victims of  crime, is thus finely drawn:      Months passed: one evening, as of early days,    When first my bosom thrilled _his_ voice to hear,    And thought upon the gentle words of praise    Which forced my lips to smile, and chased my fear:    I sang--a sob, deep, single, struck my ear;    Wondering, I gazed on Arthur, bending low--    His features were concealed, but many a tea,    Quick gushing forth, continued fast to flow,    Stood where they fell, then sank like dew-drops on the snow.      Oh yes! however cold in after years,    At least it cost thee sorrow _then_ to leave me;    And for those few sincere, remorseful tears,    I do forgive (though thou couldst thus deceive me)    The years of peace of which thou didst bereave me.    Yes--as I saw those gushing life-drops come    Back to the heart which yet delayed to grieve me,    Thy love returned a moment to its home,    Far, far away from me for ever then to roam.    He deserts her:      Still hope was left me, and each tedious hour    Was counted as it brought his coming near;    And joyfully I watched each fading flower;    Each tree, whose shadowy boughs grew red and sear;    And hailed sad Autumn, favourite of the year.    At length my time of sorrow came--'twas over,    A beauteous boy was brought me, doubly dear,    For all the Tears that promise caused to hover    Round him--'twas past--I claimed a husband in my lover.    On her return to her paternal cottage:      \"My father' oh, my father!\" vain the cry--    I had no father now; no need to say    \"Thou art alone!.\" I _felt_ my misery--    My father, yet return,--_return_! the day    When sorrow had availed is passed away:    Tears cannot raise the dead, grief cannot call    Back to the earthy corse the spirit's ray--    Vainly eternal tears of blood might fall;    One short year since, he lived--my hopes now perished all!    The tale then concludes:      Years have gone by--my thoughts have risen higher--    I sought for refuge at the Almighty's throne;    And when I sit by this low mould'ring fire,    With but my Bible, feel not quite alone.    Lingering in peace, till I can lay me down,    Quiet and cold in that last dwelling place,    By him o'er whose young head the grass is grown--    By him who yet shall rise with angel face,    Pleading for me, the lost and sinful of my race.    And if I still heave one reluctant sigh--    If earthly sorrows still will cross my heart--    If still to my now dimmed and sunken eye    The bitter tear, half checked, in vain will start;    I hid the dreams of other days depart,    And turn, with clasping hands, and lips compress'd,    To pray that Heaven will soothe sad memory's smart;    Teach me to bear and calm my troubled breast;    And grant _her_ peace in Heaven who not on earth may rest.

Of the numerous pilgrims who arrive at Mekka before the caravan, some are  professed merchants; many others bring a few articles for sale, which  they dispose of without trouble. They then pass the interval of time  before the Hadj, or pilgrimage, very pleasantly; free from cares and  apprehensions, and enjoying that supreme happiness of an Asiatic, the  _dolce far niente_. Except those of a very high rank, the pilgrims live  together in a state of freedom and equality. They keep but few servants;  many, indeed, have none, and divide among themselves the various duties  of housekeeping, such as bringing the provisions from market and cooking  them, although accustomed at home to the services of an attendant. The  freedom and oblivion of care which accompany travelling, render it a  period of enjoyment among the people of the East as among Europeans; and  the same kind of happiness results from their residence at Mekka, where  reading the Koran, smoking in the streets or coffee-houses, praying or  conversing in the mosque, are added to the indulgence of their pride in  being near the holy house, and to the anticipation of the honours  attached to the title of hadjy for the remainder of their lives; besides  the gratification of religious feelings, and the hopes of futurity, which  influence many of the pilgrims. The hadjys who come by the caravans pass  their time very differently. As soon as they have finished their tedious  journey, they must undergo the fatiguing ceremonies of visiting the Kaaba  and Omra; immediately after which, they are hurried away to Arafat and  Mekka, and, still heated from the effects of the journey, are exposed to  the keen air of the Hedjaz mountains under the slight and inadequate  covering of the ihram: then returning to Mekka, they have only a few days  left to recruit their strength, and to make their repeated visits to the  Beitullah, when the caravan sets off on its return; and thus the whole  pilgrimage is a severe trial of bodily strength, and a continual series  of fatigues and privations. This mode of visiting the holy city is,  however, in accordance with the opinions of many most learned Moslem  divines, who thought that a long residence in the Hedjaz, however  meritorious the intention, is little conducive to true belief, since the  daily sight of the holy places weakened the first impressions made by  them. Notwithstanding the general decline of Musselman zeal, there are  still found Mohammedans whose devotion induces them to visit repeatedly  the holy places.--_Burckhardt's Travels in Arabia_.           *       *       *       *       *      RUSSIAN BOTANICAL GARDEN.

The south line  contains green-house plants in the centre, and hot-house plants at each  end; the middle line has hot-house plants only, and the north line is  filled with green-house plants. The connecting corridors are two hundred  and forty-five feet. The north and south line contain respectively five  different compartments of one hundred toises each, that is to say, they  are together six thousand feet.
