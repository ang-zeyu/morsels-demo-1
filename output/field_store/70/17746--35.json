Before  proceeding further, it may be as well to take a hasty glance at the  Nervous System.    The Nervous System of man is divided into two great systems, viz., the  Cerebro-Spinal System and the Sympathetic System. The Cerebro-Spinal  System consists of all that part of the Nervous System contained  within the cranial cavity and the spinal canal, viz., the brain and  the spinal cord, together with the nerves which branch off from the  same. This system presides over the functions of animal life known as  volition, sensation, etc. The Sympathetic System includes all that  part of the Nervous System located principally in the thoracic,  abdominal and pelvic cavities, and which is distributed to the  internal organs. It has control over the involuntary processes, such  as growth, nutrition, etc.    The Cerebro-Spinal System attends to all the seeing, hearing, tasting,  smelling, feeling, etc. It sets things in motion; it is used by the  Ego to think--to manifest consciousness. It is the instrument with  which the Ego communicates with the outside world. This system may be  likened to a telephone system, with the brain as the central office,  and the spinal column and nerves as cable and wires respectively.    The brain is a great mass of nerve tissue, and consists of three  parts, viz., the Cerebrum or brain proper, which occupies the upper,  front, middle and back portion of the skull; the Cerebellum, or  \"little brain,\" which fills the lower and back portion of the skull;  and the Medulla Oblongata, which Is the broadened commencement of the  spinal cord, lying before and in front of the Cerebellum.    The Cerebrum is the organ of that part of the mind which manifests  itself in intellectual action. The Cerebellum regulates the movements  of the voluntary muscles. The Medulla Oblongata is the upper enlarged  end of the spinal cord, and from it and the Cerebrum branch forth the  Cranial Nerves which reach to various parts of the head, to the organs  of special sense, and to some of the thoracic and abdominal organs,  and to the organs of respiration.    The Spinal Cord, or spinal marrow, fills the spinal canal in the  vertebral column, or \"backbone.\" It is a long mass of nerve tissue,  branching off at the several vertebrae to nerves communicating with  all parts of the body. The Spinal Cord is like a large telephone  cable, and the emerging nerves are like the private wires connecting  therewith.    The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of a double chain of Ganglia  on the side of the Spinal column, and scattered ganglia in the head,  neck, chest and abdomen. (A ganglion is a mass of nervous matter  including nerve cells.) These ganglia are connected with each other by  filaments, and are also connected with the Cerebro-Spinal System by  motor and sensory nerves. From these ganglia numerous fibers branch  out to the organs of the body, blood vessels, etc. At various points,  the nerves meet together and form what are known as plexuses. The  Sympathetic System practically controls the involuntary processes,  such as circulation, respiration and digestion.    The power or force transmitted from the brain to all parts of the body  by means of the nerves, is known to Western science as \"nerve force,\"  although the Yogi knows it to be a manifestation of Prana. In  character and rapidity it resembles the electric current. It will be  seen that without this \"nerve force\" the heart cannot beat; the blood  cannot circulate; the lungs cannot breathe; the various organs cannot  function; in fact the machinery of the body comes to a stop without  it. Nay more, even the brain cannot think without Prana be present.  When these facts are considered, the importance of the absorption of  Prana must be evident to all, and the Science of Breath assumes an  importance even greater than that accorded it by Western science.    The Yogi teachings go further than does Western science, in one  important feature of the Nervous System. We allude to what Western  science terms the \"Solar Plexus,\" and which it considers as merely one  of a series of certain matted nets of sympathetic nerves with their  ganglia found in various parts of the body. Yogi science teaches that  this Solar Plexus is really a most important part of the Nervous  System, and that it is a form of brain, playing one of the principal  parts in the human economy. Western science seems to be moving  gradually towards a recognition of this fact which has been known to  the Yogis of the East for centuries, and some recent Western writers  have termed the Solar Plexus the \"Abdominal Brain.\" The Solar Plexus  is situated in the Epigastric region, just back of the \"pit of the  stomach\" on either side of the spinal column. It is composed of white  and gray brain matter, similar to that composing the other brains of  man. It has control of the main internal organs of man, and plays a  much more important part than is generally recognized. We will not go  into the Yogi theory regarding the Solar Plexus, further than to say  that they know it as the great central store-house of Prana. Men have  been known to be instantly killed by a severe blow over the Solar  Plexus, and prize fighters recognize its vulnerability and frequently  temporarily paralyze their opponents by a blow over this region.    The name \"Solar\" is well bestowed on this \"brain,\" as it radiates  strength and energy to all parts of the body, even the upper brains  depending largely upon it as a storehouse of Prana. Sooner or later  Western science will fully recognize the real function of the Solar  Plexus, and will accord to it a far more important place then it now  occupies in their text-books and teachings.          CHAPTER VI.      NOSTRIL-BREATHING VS. MOUTH-BREATHING.    One of the first lessons in the Yogi Science of Breath, Is to learn  how to breathe through the nostrils, and to overcome the common  practice of mouth-breathing.    The breathing mechanism of Man is so constructed that he may breathe  either through the mouth or nasal tubes, but it is a matter of vital  importance to him which method he follows, as one brings health and  strength and the other disease and weakness.    It should not be necessary to state to the student that the proper  method of breathing is to take the breath through the nostrils, but  alas! the ignorance among civilized people regarding this simple  matter is astounding. We find people in all walks of life habitually  breathing through their mouths, and allowing their children to follow  their horrible and disgusting example.    Many of the diseases to which civilized man is subject are undoubtedly  caused by this common habit of mouth-breathing. Children permitted to  breathe in this way grow up with impaired vitality and weakened  constitutions, and in manhood and womanhood break down and become  chronic invalids. The mother of the savage race does better, being  evidently guided by her intuition. She seems to instinctively  recognize that the nostrils are the proper channels for the conveyal  of air to the lungs, and she trains her infant to close its little  lips and breathe through the nose. She tips its head forward when it  is asleep, which attitude closes the lips and makes nostril-breathing  imperative. If our civilized mothers were to adopt the same plan, it  would work a great good for the race.    Many contagious diseases are contracted by the disgusting habit of  mouth-breathing, and many cases of cold and catarrhal affections are  also attributable to the same cause. Many persons who, for the sake of  appearances, keep their mouth closed during the day, persist in  mouth-breathing at night and often contract disease in this way.    Carefully conducted scientific experiments have shown that soldiers  and sailors who sleep with their mouths open are much more liable to  contract contagious diseases than those who breathe properly through  the nostrils. An instance is related in which small-pox became  epidemic on a man-of-war in foreign parts, and every death which  resulted was that of some sailor or marine who was a mouth-breather,  not a single nostril-breather succumbing.    The organs of respiration have their only protective apparatus,  filter, or dust-catcher, in the nostrils. When the breath is taken  through the mouth, there is nothing from mouth to lungs to strain the  air, or to catch the dust and other foreign matter in the air. From  mouth to lungs the dirt or impure substance has a clear track, and the  entire respiratory system is unprotected. And, moreover, such  incorrect breathing admits cold air to the organs, thereby injuring  them. Inflammation of the respiratory organs often results from the  inhalation of cold air through the mouth. The man who breathes through  the mouth at night, always awakens with a parched feeling in the mouth  and a dryness in the throat. He is violating one of nature's laws, and  is sowing the seeds of disease.    Once more, remember that the mouth affords no protection to the  respiratory organs, and cold air, dust and impurities and germs  readily enter by that door. On the other hand, the nostrils and nasal  passages show evidence of the careful design of nature in this  respect. The nostrils are two narrow, tortuous channels, containing  numerous bristly hairs which serve the purpose of a filter or sieve to  strain the air of its impurities, etc., which are expelled when the  breath is exhaled. Not only do the nostrils serve this important  purpose, but they also perform an important function in warming the  air inhaled. The long narrow winding nostrils are filled with warm  mucous membrane, which coming in contact with the inhaled air Warms it  so that it can do no damage to the delicate organs of the throat, or  to the lungs.    No animal, excepting man, sleeps with the mouth open or breathes  through the mouth, and in fact it is believed that it is only"]]]
