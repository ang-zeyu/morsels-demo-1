In Owl Bear's lodge there was a great feast, and when they had finished he  said to his people: \"Here is the man whose scalp I took. Did I say I killed  him? No. I gave him my knife and told him to kill me. He would not do it;  and he gave me his knife, but I would not kill him. So we talked together  what we should do, and now we have made peace. And now (turning to the  Snake) this is your lodge, also all the things in it. My horses, too, I  give you. All are yours.\"    So it was. The Piegan took the Snake's wife, lodge, and horses, and the  Snake took the Piegan's, and they camped side by side. All the people  camped together, and feasted each other and made presents. So the peace was  made.      V    For many days they camped side by side. The young men kept hunting, and the  women were always busy drying meat and tanning robes and cowskins. Buffalo  were always close, and after a while the people had all the meat and robes  they could carry. Then, one day, the Snake chief said to Owl Bear: \"Now, my  friend, we have camped a long time together, and I am glad we have made  peace. We have dug a hole in the ground, and in it we have put our anger  and covered it up, so there is no more war between us. And now I think it  time to go. To-morrow morning the Snakes break camp and go back south.\"    \"Your words are good,\" replied Owl Bear. \"I too am glad we have made this  peace. You say you must go south, and I feel lonesome. I would like you to  go with us so we could camp together a long time, but as you say, so it  shall be done. To-morrow you will start south. I too shall break camp, for  I would be lonesome here without you; and the Piegans will start in the  home direction.\"    The lodges were being taken down and packed. The men sat about the  fireplaces, taking a last smoke together.    They were now great friends. Many Snakes had married Piegan women, and many  Piegans had married Snake women. At last all was ready. The great chiefs  mounted their horses and started out, and soon both parties were strung out  on the trail.    Some young men, however, stayed behind to gamble a while. It was yet early  in the morning, and by riding fast it would not take them long to catch up  with their camps. All day they kept playing; and sometimes the Piegans  would win, and sometimes the Snakes.    It was now almost sunset. \"Let us have one horse race,\" they said, \"and we  will stop.\" Each side had a good horse, and they ran their best; but they  came in so close together it could not be told who won. The Snakes claimed  that their horse won, and the Piegans would not allow it. So they got  angry and began to quarrel, and pretty soon they began to fight and to  shoot at each other, and some were killed.    Since that time the Snakes and Piegans have never been at peace.        THE LOST WOMAN      I    A long time ago the Blackfeet were camped on Backfat Creek. There was in  the camp a man who had but one wife, and he thought a great deal of her. He  never wanted to have two wives. As time passed they had a child, a little  girl. Along toward the end of the summer, this man's wife wanted to get  some berries, and she asked her husband to take her to a certain place  where berries grew, so that she could get some. The man said to his wife:  \"At this time of the year, I do not like to go to that place to pick  berries. There are always Snake or Crow war parties travelling about  there.\" The woman wanted very much to go, and she coaxed her husband about  it a great deal; and at last he said he would go, and they started, and  many women followed them.    When they came to where the berries grew, the man said to his wife: \"There  are the berries down in that ravine. You may go down there and pick them,  and I will go up on this hill and stand guard. If I see any one coming, I  will call out to you, and you must all get on your horses and run.\" So the  women went down to pick berries.    The man went up on the hill and sat down and looked over the country. After  a little time, he looked down into another ravine not far off, and saw that  it was full of horsemen coming. They started to gallop up towards him, and  he called out in a loud voice, \"Run, run, the enemy is rushing on us.\" The  women started to run, and he jumped on his horse and followed them. The  enemy rushed after them, and he drew his bow and arrows, and got ready to  fight and defend the women. After they had gone a little way, the enemy had  gained so much that they were shooting at the Blackfeet with their arrows,  and the man was riding back and forth behind the women, and whipping up the  horses, now of one, now of another, to make them go faster. The enemy kept  getting closer, and at last they were so near that they were beginning to  thrust at him with their lances, and he was dodging them and throwing  himself down, now on one side of his horse, and then on the other.    At length he found that he could no longer defend all the women, so he made  up his mind to leave those that had the slowest horses to the mercy of the  enemy, while he would go on with those that had the faster ones. When he  found that he must leave the women, he was excited and rode on ahead; but  as he passed, he heard some one call out to him, \"Don't leave me,\" and he  looked to one side, and saw that he was leaving his wife. When he heard his  wife call out thus to him, he said to her: \"There is no life for me  here. You are a fine-looking woman. They will not kill you, but there is no  life for me.\" She answered: \"No, take pity on me. Do not leave me. My horse  is giving out. Let us both get on one horse and then, if we are caught, we  will die together.\" When he heard this, his heart was touched and he said:  \"No, wife, I will not leave you. Run up beside my horse and jump on behind  me.\" The enemy were now so near that they had killed or captured some of  the women, and they had come up close enough to the man so that they got  ready to hit at him with their war clubs. His horse was now wounded in  places with arrows, but it was a good, strong, fast horse.    His wife rode up close to him, and jumped on his horse behind him. When he  started to run with her, the enemy had come up on either side of him, and  some were behind him, but they were afraid to shoot their arrows for fear  of hitting their own people, so they struck at the man with their war  clubs. But they did not want to kill the woman, and they did not hurt  him. They reached out with their hands to try to pull the woman off the  horse; but she had put her arms around her husband and held on tight, and  they could not get her off, but they tore her clothing off her. As she held  her husband, he could not use his arrows, and could not fight to defend  himself. His horse was now going very slowly, and all the enemy had caught  up to them, and were all around them.    The man said to his wife: \"Never mind, let them take you: they will not  kill you. You are too handsome a woman for them to kill you.\" His wife  said, \"No, it is no harm for us both to die together.\" When he saw that his  wife would not get off the horse and that he could not fight, he said to  her: \"Here, look out! You are crowding me on to the neck of the horse. Sit  further back.\" He began to edge himself back, and at last, when he got his  wife pretty far back on the horse, he gave a great push and shoved her off  behind. When she fell off, his horse had more speed and began to run away  from the enemy, and he would shoot back his arrows; and now, when they  would ride up to strike him with their hatchets, he would shoot them and  kill them, and they began to be afraid of him, and to edge away from  him. His horse was very long-winded; and now, as he was drawing away from  the enemy, there were only two who were yet able to keep up with him. The  rest were being left behind, and they stopped, and went back to where the  others had killed or captured the women; and now only two men were  pursuing.    After a little while, the Blackfoot jumped off his horse to fight on foot,  and the two enemies rode up on either side of him, but a long way off, and  jumped off their horses. When he saw the two on either side of him, he took  a sheaf of arrows in his hand and began to rush, first toward the one on  the right, and then toward the one on the left. As he did this, he saw that  one of the men, when he ran toward him and threatened to shoot, would draw  away from him, while the other would stand still. Then he knew that one of  them was a coward and the other a brave man. But all the time they were  closing in on him. When he saw that they were closing in on him, he made a  rush at the brave man. This one was shooting arrows all the time; but the  Blackfoot did not shoot until he got close to him, and then he shot an  arrow into him and ran up to him and hit him with his stone axe and killed  him. Then he turned to the cowardly one and ran at him. The man turned to  run, but the Blackfoot caught him and hit him with his axe and killed him.    After he had killed them, he scalped them and took their arrows, their  horses, and the stone knives that they had. Then he went home, and when he  rode into the camp he was crying over the loss of his wife. When he came to  his lodge and got off his horse, his friends went up to him and asked what  was the matter. He told them how all the women had been killed, and how he  had been pursued by two enemies, and had fought with them and killed them  both, and he showed them the arrows and the horses and the scalps. He told  the women's relations that they had all been killed; and all were in great  sorrow, and crying over the loss of their friends.    The next morning they held a council, and it was decided that a party  should go out and see where the battle had been, and find out what had  become of the women. When they got"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#4)"],[1,"word of our God shall stand forever.\"_    _\"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not  return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it  shall prosper in the things whereto I sent it.\"_           *       *       *       *       *          ANSWERS TO PRAYER      A WONDERFUL ANSWER TO PRAYER AND PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE HOLY  SPIRIT.      A trustful Christian, whose heart had been deeply touched with thoughts  of religion, was one day thinking and pondering and wishing that he  might be more truly convinced of the actual existence of the Holy  Spirit. \"If,\" thought he, \"there is a Holy Spirit, a Superior Mind and  Will, I reverently and sincerely wish that I may be convinced of it  beyond all doubt; that I may indeed know God is a living reality and  daily guide and mighty among the plans and ways of men.\" Though having  all the needed mental, historic and heart belief and trust in God--still  there was desired that special satisfaction which can only come by  _personal evidence._    With reverent feeling one morning, he asked the Lord humbly, in Prayer,  \"_What can thy servant, do for thee this day? Teach him, that he may  gladly minister to any one in thy name_.\" In the course of the day there  came to him the thought of the revival services then proceeding in  Brooklyn, and feeling a cordial sympathy, he sat down and wrote a letter  to _Mr. Moody_, with these words: \"_I know not how you are supported, or  anything of your needs; but I feel like helping you in your good work.  Enclosed find check for $25; take it and use it if you need it for  yourself; if not, then do some good with it_.\" The circumstance was  almost forgotten, when the day after there came this wonderful reply  from Mr. Moody:         \"_Your letter came to hand in the_ SAME MAIL, _at the_ SAME       INSTANT _of_ TIME, _with a letter from a brother in distress_       WANTING THE SAME AMOUNT. _And now you have made him happy, and       my heart glad, and the Lord will bless you for it.\"_           D.L. MOODY.    Had there been a direct revelation from heaven, it could not have been  more astounding than this, to the heart of that Christian. His own  prayer was answered, as to his search for the evidences of the Holy  Spirit, but oh, how wonderfully!    None but a Superior, Higher, Overruling Spirit, could have known the  thoughts and desires of each heart. Nothing but an Omnipotent hand of  Power and Wisdom could have brought these two letters together at that  identical instant of time. None but an All-knowing Father could have  fixed the amount of money which the one was to give and the other was to  pray for.    This was a wonderful conjuncture of time, desire and amount, and could  never have happened by any chance operation of Nature or the natural  heart and will. Strangest of all, neither of the parties had ever met,  known or corresponded with each other before. Neither did Mr. Moody know  of the desire of the one, nor the necessity of the other, until in the  act of opening the two letters side by side. In the one envelope was the  prayer; in the other the answer.    That check, those letters, with all signatures and endorsements and  those persons are this day living and can testify to the authenticity of  the circumstance.      THE PRAYER OF FAITH.      The family of Mr. James R. Jordan has resided in Lake View, Chicago,  since the spring of 1871. They are members of Lincoln Park  Congregational Church. The father, Mr. James R. Jordan, died in October,  1882, aged eighty-four years. Through a long series of financial trials,  sorrows, afflictions by death and pressing cares, this family learned to  depend on God for their daily prosperity; and the cures wrought in them,  according to God's Word, are only a small portion of the remarkable  answers to prayer with which their history is filled.    It is an instructive fact for Christian meditation, that when the  exercise of intelligent faith was necessary to their cures, the faith  was there _ready for exercise._ They had not to begin, as, alas! so many  do, at the very foundation, and find out first, what faith is, and next,  how to exercise it. They had learned long before what faith is and what  faith is not; that _faith is trustful obedience to the Word of God;_  that it _is not_ a determination to have one's own way, nor to expect  the immediate gratification of a desire, simply because the desire has  been made known to God. They knew that faith obediently accepts God's  commands and promises, expects to comply with the conditions of those  commands and promises, and, so complying, expects to receive the results  of such obedience at such times and in such ways as God appoints; all of  which truths they found, and all of which may be found in the Holy  Scriptures.    Thus living in the hopes of the Gospel, realizing as much that their  \"home is in heaven\" as that their \"rest is not here,\" they have, through  the years, performed the daily duties of their pilgrimage.    The writer has known them for thirteen years, and gratefully testifies  that their faith has strengthened her's, and that their cheerful hope in  the Lord has been a strong consolation to many who were in trouble.    After the sudden death of the youngest son of the family, in 1880, the  care of the family devolved entirely upon the two daughters, Mrs. H.J.  Furlong and Miss Addie S. Jordan.    In April, 1876, Mrs. Jordan fell and badly fractured her hip. She was  then seventy-seven years old. On account of her age she could not well  be etherized, nor endure the repeated necessary resetting of the bones,  and consequently they grew together irregularly. Her hip-joint was  stiff, so that she was never able to walk without the support of a cane  or crutch. For eight years she could not leave her own little yard, nor  climb into a carriage, nor walk without support.    Through this misfortune her afflictions grew worse. In January, 1884,  she fell and broke one bone and dislocated another in the left wrist.  Notwithstanding all that medical help could do, the shock brought on a  severe sickness, and when, after eight weeks, she left her bed to move  around feebly, she had almost lost her sight and hearing, her hand was  useless, and her mind greatly impaired.    On her birthday, June 10, 1884, when she was eighty-five years old, she  greatly mourned that she had outlived her usefulness; that she could no  longer feed herself, nor read her Bible, nor remember the desirable  subjects for her prayers, and she hoped that she should not linger here  long in such a helpless and useless condition.    During the latter part of this time the two daughters were sick, Mrs.  Furlong with paralysis and Miss Jordan with consumption.    In the latter part of 1882 Miss Jordan, then in feeble health, was  needed at home to attend the father's last sickness, and Mrs. Furlong  was left to conduct their business alone. 'The extraordinary exertion  brought on paralysis. It began in her right arm, which became so  insensible that the strongest ammonia produced no sensation or apparent  effect. Gradually her whole right side lost power, her foot dragged, and  though she did manage to move about, she was comparatively helpless.  Physicians spoke not hopefully; and protracted rest was recommended as a  _possible_ relief. She planned to take electric treatment, though not  very hopeful about the result. She failed once to meet her physician,  and while planning the second time to take the treatment, and  considering Christ's miracles of healing, and the Bible's promises to  the sick, and having a feeling that possibly she might be doing wrong in  not relying entirely on the Lord, who had hitherto so much helped them,  she delayed a little, and failed again to meet the appointment. It was a  Saturday evening in January, 1883.    She went home and sat down that evening alone, in the dining-room,  depressed. The enfeebled family--the aged crippled mother, the sick  sister and her own young son--had retired. As she thought the subject  through, she became convinced that it was not good to spend time and  money in the way proposed. Instantly the words THE SAVIOUR filled her  soul with indescribable hope, and as she thought of His miracles, and  how _the same Jesus_, on earth, healed paralyzed ones, the hope grew  that He would heal her.    With the well hand she stretched out her paralyzed hand on the table and  said: \"Dear Lord, will you heal me?\" Like an electric shock the life  began to move in her arm, and the continued sensation was as though  something that, previously, had not moved was set in motion. The feeling  passed up to the head, and down the body to the foot. _She was healed!  and she was grateful!_ She did not speak of her experience to the  family, but retired. She rose early the next morning, and awoke her  son,--a prayerful, dutiful young man,--and said to him, \"I'm going to  church, to-day.\" He replied, \"Then I'll get up and go with you,\"  expecting that she must ride.    Her soul was solemnly full that day of the felt presence of the Holy  Spirit, and she did not like to talk. Her son watched her movements,  astonished.    She went to the church, took a class again in Sunday School, and; in  going back and forth to church that day and evening, walked about sixty  blocks without weariness.    We are not permitted, here, to draw aside the curtain, to dwell upon the  surprises and the grateful joy of that ever-to-be-remembered, sacred  day.    A few days after this healing, she, with a consciousness that she was  running a risk, lifted a heavy weight, and a numbness returned. She  confessed the sin to the Lord, and asked Him that, when she had been  sufficiently chastened, He would take the trouble away. Gradually,  within two days, it disappeared, and has never returned.    At the time when Mrs. Furlong was healed, in answer to prayer, Miss.  Jordan's case was"]]]
