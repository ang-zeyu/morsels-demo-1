For a long time she was enabled to govern and controul her feelings, and  was silent, and, to outward seeming, resigned. She often remarked to her  father, that she could, and did, say daily upon her knees, \"Thy will be  done,\"--but that tears always followed that sincere, but mournful,  exercise. However her frame at last gave way--she sunk into great  weakness of body, and her mind became affected.    Her father watched her with unceasing solicitude throughout her  sufferings; but he was often driven from her chamber by the agony of his  emotions, as she read over the fatal letter, or sung, which she did  continually, that mournful song of Thecla.      The world it is empty, the heart will die,    There's nothing to wish for beneath the sky:    Thou Holy One, call Thy child away--    I've lived and loved; and that was to-day--      Make ready my grave-clothes to-morrow.      Such was the early and melancholy close of a young life of the loveliest  promise. The severe and sudden horror struck hard upon her fine mind,  and drove it mournfully astray. Her heart was so broken that she could  not live on. But Julius Alvinzi did not then or so perish: for seventeen  weeks he lay upon a hospital bed in Mantua, helpless as an infant;  and finally recovered so much of health as gave him again the common  promise of life. He was afterwards sent to pass the long period of his  convalescence at Venice; but the Julius Alvinzi, who rode forth from  Salzburgh, was no longer to be recognised: crippled in his limbs--his  fine countenance disfigured by deep and unsightly scars--his complexion  pale--his hair turned grey with suffering. He had already stepped on  twenty years in as many weeks, and he was already, to the eye, a worn  and broken-down officer of veterans. He could not stir a pace without  crutches; and his hip had been so shattered and distorted that it was  painful to see him move. It was well that Beatrice was in her grave. No  doubt she would have exhibited the noble constancy of a pure, angelic,  and true love;--but she was spared that longer and heavier trial.    Alvinzi, like a stricken deer, betook himself, with decayed hopes and an  aching bosom, to a retired valley near Burgersdorf, about ten miles from  Vienna. Here he took a small fishing cottage, near a lone and lovely  stream, which flowed across a few velvet meadows, amid deep dells  and still woods; and here he threw himself on the beautiful bosom of  nature as on that of a mother. Here, for the first time, he was made  acquainted, by a letter and a packet from the aged and desolate Adony,  of the melancholy end of the lovely Beatrice. The packet contained a  small cross which she had always worn, her miniature, and her psalter.    The traveller who may now wander into the little valley, near  Burgersdorf, where Alvinzi dwelt, will find the cypress, planted upon  his grave the day after his funeral, only three years' growth; and if he  go and sit under the tree, beneath which Alvinzi reposed his withered  and broken frame for thirty summers, will perhaps agree with the  narrator of this mournful story, that mercy was mingled in his bitter  cup, and that      Society is all but rude,    To that delicious solitude.      The peasants of that valley tell, with a superstitious awe, that Alvinzi  was wont to discourse for hours together with departed spirits; and  that they have stolen near his tree at sunset, and in the gloom of the  evening, and by moonlight, and have distinctly heard him talking with  some one whom he called \"Beatrice.\"    [The Embellishments of the _Souvenir_ are nearly on a par with  those of previous years, with a light sprinkling of originality in the  subjects.]           *       *       *       *       *          FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *    CROSSES.[3]      [Illustration: (_In Devonshire_,)]    The subjoined are two specimens of rude workmanship, in comparison with  the ingenuity displayed in the Crosses already illustrated in our pages.  They are engraved from a drawing made by Mr. Britton, about thirty years  since. The first was in Devonshire, at the village of Alphington, about  one mile west of Exeter, on the side of the road leading from that city  to Plymouth. It represents the Calvary cross of heraldry, and consists  of a block of granite, which has been cut in an octagon shape, and fixed  in a large base.    [Illustration: (_In Cornwall_,)]    The second cross stood in Cornwall, on the wide waste of Caraton Down.  It consists of one block with a rounded head, bearing the couped cross.  This solitary pillar, evidently a Christian monument, is situate near a  Druidical temple called \"the Hurlers.\" Crosses of this shape abound in  Cornwall. One has been found in Burian churchyard, and another in  Callington churchyard, bearing rude sculptures of the crucifixion;  others have been found in the county with holes perforated near the top,  and some with various ornaments on the shafts.          [3] We thank \"an old Subscriber and a native of Holbeach\" for his          testimony to the accuracy of our Engraving of Holbeach Cross, at          page 329 of the present volume. We shall feel further obliged to          him for the view of Holbeach Church.            We may here remark that the Cross described at page 115, at          Wheston, is now in the courtyard of Wheston Hall. Probably our          Correspondent _E.T.B.A_. will oblige us with a drawing of that          interesting structure.             *       *       *       *       *          DOMESTIC HINTS.           *       *       *       *       *      OLIVE OIL.      Few articles differ more in quality than olive oil; not that the  different kinds are produced from different fruit, but in the different  stages of the pressure of the olives. Thus, by means of gentle pressure,  the best or _virgin_ oil flows first; a second, and afterwards a  third quality of oil is obtained, by moistening the residuum, breaking  the kernels, &c. and increasing the pressure. When the fruit is not  sufficiently ripe, the recent oil has a bitterish taste; and when too  ripe it is fatty. After the oil has been drawn, it deposits a white,  fibrous, and albuminous matter; but when this deposition has taken  place, if it be put into clean flasks, it undergoes no further  alteration. The common oil cannot, however, be preserved in casks above  a year and a half or two years. The consumption of olive oil as food is  not surprising if we remember, that it is the lightest and most delicate  of all the fixed oils.           *       *       *       *       *      CARDS.      Some misconception has arisen respecting the legality of _Second-hand  Cards_. It appears, however, that they may be sold by any person, if  sold without the wrapper of a licensed maker; and in packs containing  not more than 52 cards, including an ace of spades duly stamped, and  enclosed in a wrapper with the words \"Second-hand Cards\" printed or  written in distinct characters on the outside: penalty for selling  Second-hand Cards in any other manner, 20l.           *       *       *       *       *      CINNAMON AND CASSIA.      Cassia bark resembles Cinnamon in appearance, smell, and taste, and is  very often substituted for it; but it may be readily distinguished: it  is thicker in substance, less quilled, breaks shorter, and is more  pungent. It should be chosen in thin pieces: the best being that which  approaches nearest to Cinnamon in flavour; but that which is small and  broken should be rejected.           *       *       *       *       *      COLOURING CHEESE.      The fine, bright, red colour of some Gloucester cheese has been  fraudulently produced by red lead, which, we need scarcely observe, is a  violent poison. The ingredient now employed for this purpose, (to the  exclusion of every thing else) in Cheshire and Gloucestershire, is  annatto, a dye prepared from the seeds of a tree of South America. It is  perfectly harmless in the proportion in which it is used; an ounce of  genuine annatto being sufficient to colour a hundred weight of cheese.  It may, however, be questioned whether annatto is not sometimes  adulterated with red lead.    Gouda cheese, the best made in Holland, is prized for its soundness,  which is referable to muriatic acid being used in curdling the milk  instead of rennet. This renders it pungent, and preserves it from  mites. Parmesan cheese, so called from Parma in Italy, where it is  manufactured, and highly prized, is merely a skim-milk cheese, which  owes its rich flavour to the fine herbage of the meadows along the  Po, where the cows feed.           *       *       *       *       *      BASKET SALT.

When this girl comes down  to steal sugar-cane she takes off her star dress and appears as a  beautiful maiden; [28] she becomes enamored with Aponitolau and takes  him to the sky, where he lives with her. They have a child, who later  marries in Kadalayapan and thereafter stays below. Upon the occasion  when Aponitolau visits his first wife and fails to return to the sky  at the appointed time, a great company of stars are sent to fetch him,  with orders to devour him if he refuses to obey (p. 109, ff.).    In the first tale Aponitolau himself appears as \"the sun,\" \"the  man who makes the sun,\" as \"a round stone which rolls,\" but when  it is established that he is the son of a couple in Kadalayapan he  apparently relinquishes his duties in the sky and goes to live in  the village of his people. With him goes his wife Aponibolinayen, who  had been carried above by a vine. While at his post in the heavens,  Aponitolau is closely associated with the big star, whose duty it is  to follow him in the sky. Again we are told that Aponitolau is taken  up by the spirit Kabkabaga-an, whom he marries and by whom he has a son  (p. 114). In some instances this hero and his son Kanag converse with  thunder and lightning, which appear at times not unlike human beings  (p. 100); but in the eighth relation the two kinds of lightning are  pictured as dogs who guard the town of Dona.    These people enjoy unusual relations with inanimate things, and we find  them conversing with spears and with jars. [29] In one case the latter  appear to be pastured like animals, and surround Aponitolau when he  goes to feed them with _lawed_ [30] leaves and salt (p. 51). Weapons  weep blood and oil when taken down for the purpose of injuring certain  persons (p. 43). A nose flute, when played by a youth, tells him of  his mother's plight (p. 152), while a bamboo Jew's harp summons the  brothers of its owner (p. 162). Animals and birds are frequently in  communication with them: The hawk flies away and spreads the news of  the fight at Adasin [31] (p. 90); at the bidding of Dalonagan a spider  spins a web about the town (p. 124); and Aponitolau is enabled to  fulfill the labors assigned him by the ten-headed giant only through  the aid of spiders, ants, and flies (p. 101). [32] During certain  dances the water from the river flows over the town and fish come  up and bite the feet of the dancers (p. 59). Crocodiles are left to  guard the sister of Aponibalagen, and when they fail to explain their  negligence they are whipped and sent away by their master (p. 87). A  great bird is pleased with Aponitolau and carries him away [33] to its  home, where it forces him to marry a woman it had previously captured  (p. 92). In one instance an animal gives birth to a human child; a frog  laps up the spittle of Aponitolau, and as a result becomes pregnant  [34] and gives birth to a maiden who is taken away by the spirits  (p. 105). Another account states that the three sons of Aponitolau  and Aponibolinayen are born as pigs, but later assume human form  (p. 116). Kanag becomes a snake when he tries to secure the perfume  of Baliwan, but is restored to human form when he bathes in a magic  well (p. 137). These and other mysterious happenings, many of which  are not explained as being due to their own volition, befall them;  thus Ingiwan, while walking, is confronted by an impassable hill and  is compelled to cross the ocean, where he finds his future wife, but  upon his return the hill has vanished (p. 86). In other instances the  finger rings of people meeting for the first time exchange themselves  (p. 92). The headband of Ligi flies away without his knowledge and  alights on the skirt of a girl who is bathing in the river. As a  result she becomes pregnant, and when the facts become known Ligi is  recognized as the child's father (p. 144). It seems probable that  the superior powers are responsible for these occurrences, for in  at least one instance the great spirit Kaboniyan steals a maiden and  turns her into a flock of birds, who talk with and assist the owner  of a rice field (p. 151).    While they thus appear to be to a certain extent under the control  of the spirits and to be surrounded by animals and inanimate things  with human intelligence and speech, the people of these \"first times\"  possess great power over nature: Time and space are annihilated, for  at their will daylight comes at once (p. 150), or they are transported  to a place in an instant (p. 92). At their command people appear:  Kanag creates betel-nut trees, then cuts the fruit into bits, which he  sows on the ground. From these come many people who are his neighbors,  and one of whom he marries (p. 121). The course of nature is changed:  A field is planted in an instant; the crops mature in a few days, and  the grain and fruits take themselves to the store-house (p. 150). A  strike-a-light turns into a hill which impedes pursuers [35] (p. 75),  while a belt or headaxe serves as a ferry across a body of water  (p. 84). A storm is called upon to carry a person or a building to  a distance (p. 121), and a spring is created by killing an old man  (p. 60). [36] Prepared food appears at a word; a stick when cooked  becomes a fish, and though it is repeatedly broken and served it  always appears ready for service at meal time (p. 33); a small jar  containing a single grain of rice supplies an abundance of food;  another jar no larger than a fist furnishes drink for a company and  still remains a third full; while a single earring fills a pot with  gold [37] (pp. 47, 119, 123).    Quite as easy as the creation of beings is the causing of sleep or  death. All the people of a village are put to sleep at the will of a  single person (p. 145) and Albaga--while still at a distance--causes  the death of Aponibolinayen (p. 44). At a word of command the  spears and headaxes of the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan go out  and kill great numbers of the enemy, and the heads and booty take  themselves in orderly fashion to towns of their new owners (pp. 66,  75). Many methods of restoring the dead to life are employed; spittle  is applied to the wounds, or the victim is placed in a magic well,  but the common method is for the hero \"to whip his perfume,\" [38]  whereupon the dead follow his commands (pp. 152, 157).    The birth of a child, to a woman of these times, is generally preceded  by an intense itching between the third and last fingers, and when this  spot is pricked the child pops out \"like popped rice.\" [39] Its growth  is always magical, for at each bath its stature increases by a span  (p. 102). Within a few days the baby is a large child and then begins  deeds of valor worthy of the most renowned warriors (pp. 95, 96).    The power of assuming animal forms appears to be a common possession,  and we find the different characters changing themselves into  fire-flies, ants, centipedes, omen birds, and in one case into oil [40]  (pp. 85, 99).    One of the most peculiar yet constantly used powers of these people  is their ability to send betel-nuts on various missions. Whenever  an invitation to a ceremony or celebration is to be extended, nuts  covered with gold are oiled and sent out. They go to the intended  guest, state their errand, and, if refused, forthwith proceed to grow  on his knee, forehead, or pet pig, until pain or pity compels him to  accept (p. 146). In some cases it appears that the nuts themselves  possess the magic properties, for we find Aponitolau demanding that  his conquered foes give him their betel-nuts with magic power (p. 91).    Relationships can be readily ascertained by the chewing of these nuts,  for when the quids are laid down they are transformed into agate and  golden beads and lie in such a manner that the associations are fully  established (pp. 35, 36, 41).    Enough has been mentioned to show how important a part magic and  magical practices play in the life of this people, but one further  reference should be made, since it is found in nearly every tale. When  the marriage price is settled upon, the mother of the groom exercises  her power and at once fills the spirit house with valuable jars and the  like; this is repeated until enough are gathered to meet the demands  of the girl's people (p. 133). Even when the agreed sum has been  delivered we often find the girl's mother herself practicing magic,  to secure additional payment, and by raising her elbows or eyebrows  causing a part of the jars to vanish (pp. 133, 143).    Despite their great gifts we find that these people are not  all-powerful and that they deem it wise to consult the omens before  starting on a task or a journey. The gall sack and liver of a pig are  eagerly examined, [41] while the calls of birds, actions of animals,  or signs received from the thunder and lightning regulate their  conduct. In cases where these warnings are disregarded misfortune or  death always overtakes the individual (pp. 48, 49, 100 ff).    Death comes to them, but apparently is only a temporary state. The  deceased are often revived by some magical process (p. 152), but if  not the corpse is placed on a raft and is set adrift on the river. [42]  The streams and rivers, we are told, all flow past Nagbotobotan before  they empty into the hole where all streams go. In this place lives the  old woman Alokotan, who is related to the people of Kadalayapan and  Kaodanan. Her duty it is to watch for dead relatives, to secure them,  and make them alive again (p. 132). She is the owner of a magic pool,  the waters of which revive the dead and renew youth.    _Comparison of the Reconstructed Culture with Present Day  Conditions_.--Before passing to a consideration of the tales in the  last two divisions of our material, it may be well to compare the life  and beliefs of these \"people of the first times\" with those of the  living Tinguian.
