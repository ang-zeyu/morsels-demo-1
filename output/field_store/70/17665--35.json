But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your uncle will  wonder what has become of us.\"    He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon  furtively running in order to keep up with him.          CHAPTER IV--THE LADY ARABELLA MARCH      \"Now, there is no hurry, but so soon as you are both ready we shall  start,\" Mr. Salton said when breakfast had begun.  \"I want to take you  first to see a remarkable relic of Mercia, and then we'll go to Liverpool  through what is called 'The Great Vale of Cheshire.'  You may be  disappointed, but take care not to prepare your mind\"--this to Adam--\"for  anything stupendous or heroic.  You would not think the place a vale at  all, unless you were told so beforehand, and had confidence in the  veracity of the teller.  We should get to the Landing Stage in time to  meet the _West African_, and catch Mr. Caswall as he comes ashore.  We  want to do him honour--and, besides, it will be more pleasant to have the  introductions over before we go to his _fete_ at the Castle.\"    The carriage was ready, the same as had been used the previous day, but  there were different horses--magnificent animals, and keen for work.  Breakfast was soon over, and they shortly took their places.  The  postillions had their orders, and were quickly on their way at an  exhilarating pace.    Presently, in obedience to Mr. Salton's signal, the carriage drew up  opposite a great heap of stones by the wayside.    \"Here, Adam,\" he said, \"is something that you of all men should not pass  by unnoticed.  That heap of stones brings us at once to the dawn of the  Anglian kingdom.  It was begun more than a thousand years ago--in the  latter part of the seventh century--in memory of a murder.  Wulfere, King  of Mercia, nephew of Penda, here murdered his two sons for embracing  Christianity.  As was the custom of the time, each passer-by added a  stone to the memorial heap.  Penda represented heathen reaction after St.  Augustine's mission.  Sir Nathaniel can tell you as much as you want  about this, and put you, if you wish, on the track of such accurate  knowledge as there is.\"    Whilst they were looking at the heap of stones, they noticed that another  carriage had drawn up beside them, and the passenger--there was only  one--was regarding them curiously.  The carriage was an old heavy  travelling one, with arms blazoned on it gorgeously.  The men took off  their hats, as the occupant, a lady, addressed them.    \"How do you do, Sir Nathaniel?  How do you do, Mr. Salton?  I hope you  have not met with any accident.  Look at me!\"    As she spoke she pointed to where one of the heavy springs was broken  across, the broken metal showing bright.  Adam spoke up at once:    \"Oh, that can soon be put right.\"    \"Soon?  There is no one near who can mend a break like that.\"    \"I can.\"    \"You!\"  She looked incredulously at the dapper young gentleman who spoke.  \"You--why, it's a workman's job.\"    \"All right, I am a workman--though that is not the only sort of work I  do.  I am an Australian, and, as we have to move about fast, we are all  trained to farriery and such mechanics as come into travel--I am quite at  your service.\"    \"I hardly know how to thank you for your kindness, of which I gladly  avail myself.  I don't know what else I can do, as I wish to meet Mr.  Caswall of Castra Regis, who arrives home from Africa to-day.  It is a  notable home-coming; all the countryside want to do him honour.\"  She  looked at the old men and quickly made up her mind as to the identity of  the stranger.  \"You must be Mr. Adam Salton of Lesser Hill.  I am Lady  Arabella March of Diana's Grove.\"  As she spoke she turned slightly to  Mr. Salton, who took the hint and made a formal introduction.    So soon as this was done, Adam took some tools from his uncle's carriage,  and at once began work on the broken spring.  He was an expert workman,  and the breach was soon made good.  Adam was gathering the tools which he  had been using--which, after the manner of all workmen, had been  scattered about--when he noticed that several black snakes had crawled  out from the heap of stones and were gathering round him.  This naturally  occupied his mind, and he was not thinking of anything else when he  noticed Lady Arabella, who had opened the door of the carriage, slip from  it with a quick gliding motion.  She was already among the snakes when he  called out to warn her.  But there seemed to be no need of warning.  The  snakes had turned and were wriggling back to the mound as quickly as they  could.  He laughed to himself behind his teeth as he whispered, \"No need  to fear there.  They seem much more afraid of her than she of them.\"  All  the same he began to beat on the ground with a stick which was lying  close to him, with the instinct of one used to such vermin.  In an  instant he was alone beside the mound with Lady Arabella, who appeared  quite unconcerned at the incident.  Then he took a long look at her, and  her dress alone was sufficient to attract attention.  She was clad in  some kind of soft white stuff, which clung close to her form, showing to  the full every movement of her sinuous figure.  She wore a close-fitting  cap of some fine fur of dazzling white.  Coiled round her white throat  was a large necklace of emeralds, whose profusion of colour dazzled when  the sun shone on them.  Her voice was peculiar, very low and sweet, and  so soft that the dominant note was of sibilation.  Her hands, too, were  peculiar--long, flexible, white, with a strange movement as of waving  gently to and fro.    She appeared quite at ease, and, after thanking Adam, said that if any of  his uncle's party were going to Liverpool she would be most happy to join  forces.    \"Whilst you are staying here, Mr. Salton, you must look on the grounds of  Diana's Grove as your own, so that you may come and go just as you do in  Lesser Hill.  There are some fine views, and not a few natural  curiosities which are sure to interest you, if you are a student of  natural history--specially of an earlier kind, when the world was  younger.\"    The heartiness with which she spoke, and the warmth of her words--not of  her manner, which was cold and distant--made him suspicious.  In the  meantime both his uncle and Sir Nathaniel had thanked her for the  invitation--of which, however, they said they were unable to avail  themselves.  Adam had a suspicion that, though she answered regretfully,  she was in reality relieved.  When he had got into the carriage with the  two old men, and they had driven off, he was not surprised when Sir  Nathaniel spoke.    \"I could not but feel that she was glad to be rid of us.  She can play  her game better alone!\"    \"What is her game?\" asked Adam unthinkingly.    \"All the county knows it, my boy.  Caswall is a very rich man.  Her  husband was rich when she married him--or seemed to be.  When he  committed suicide, it was found that he had nothing left, and the estate  was mortgaged up to the hilt.  Her only hope is in a rich marriage.  I  suppose I need not draw any conclusion; you can do that as well as I  can.\"    Adam remained silent nearly all the time they were travelling through the  alleged Vale of Cheshire.  He thought much during that journey and came  to several conclusions, though his lips were unmoved.  One of these  conclusions was that he would be very careful about paying any attention  to Lady Arabella.  He was himself a rich man, how rich not even his uncle  had the least idea, and would have been surprised had he known.    The remainder of the journey was uneventful, and upon arrival at  Liverpool they went aboard the _West African_, which had just come to the  landing-stage.  There his uncle introduced himself to Mr. Caswall, and  followed this up by introducing Sir Nathaniel and then Adam.  The new-  comer received them graciously, and said what a pleasure it was to be  coming home after so long an absence of his family from their old seat.  Adam was pleased at the warmth of the reception; but he could not avoid a  feeling of repugnance at the man's face.  He was trying hard to overcome  this when a diversion was caused by the arrival of Lady Arabella.  The  diversion was welcome to all; the two Saltons and Sir Nathaniel were  shocked at Caswall's face--so hard, so ruthless, so selfish, so dominant.  \"God help any,\" was the common thought, \"who is under the domination of  such a man!\"    Presently his African servant approached him, and at once their thoughts  changed to a larger toleration.  Caswall looked indeed a savage--but a  cultured savage.  In him were traces of the softening civilisation of  ages--of some of the higher instincts and education of man, no matter how  rudimentary these might be.  But the face of Oolanga, as his master  called him, was unreformed, unsoftened savage, and inherent in it were  all the hideous possibilities of a lost, devil-ridden child of the forest  and the swamp--the lowest of all created things that could be regarded as  in some form ostensibly human.  Lady Arabella and Oolanga arrived almost  simultaneously, and Adam was surprised to notice what effect their  appearance had on each other.  The woman seemed as if she would not--could  not--condescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature.  On  the other hand, the negro's bearing was such as in itself to justify her  pride.  He treated her not merely as a slave treats his master, but as a  worshipper would treat a deity.  He knelt before her with his hands out-  stretched and his forehead in the dust.  So long as she remained he did  not move; it was only when she went over to Caswall that he relaxed his  attitude of devotion and stood by respectfully.    Adam spoke to his own man,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#4)"],[1,"?\"    \"It sure is,\" replied Ronicky Doone instantly. \"Not a bit of a doubt  about it.\"    \"It starts you doubting things,\" went on Gregg bitterly, \"and pretty  soon you're even doubting yourself.\" Here he cast an envious glance at  the smooth brow of his companion. \"But I guess that never happened to  you, Ronicky?\"    \"You'd be surprised if I told you,\" said Ronicky.    \"Well,\" went on Bill Gregg, \"I got so darned tired of my own thoughts  and of myself that I decided something had ought to be done; something  to give me new things to think about. So I sat down and went over the  whole deal.    \"I had to get new ideas. Then I thought of what a gent had told me  once. He'd got pretty interested in mining and figured he wanted to  know all about how the fancy things was done. So he sent off to some  correspondence schools. Well, they're a great bunch. They say: 'Write  us a lot of letters and ask us your questions. Before you're through  you'll know something you want to know.' See?\"    \"I see.\"    \"I didn't have anything special I wanted to learn except how to use  myself for company when I got tired of solitaire. So I sat down and  wrote to this here correspondence school and says: 'I want to do  something interesting. How d'you figure that I had better begin?' And  what d'you think they answered back?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky, his interest steadily increasing.    \"Well, sir, the first thing they wrote back was: 'We have your letter  and think that in the first place you had better learn how to write.'  That was a queer answer, wasn't it?\"    \"It sure was.\" Ronicky swallowed a smile.    \"Every time I looked at that letter it sure made me plumb mad. And I  looked at it a hundred times a day and come near tearing it up every  time. But I didn't,\" continued Bill.    \"Why not?\"    \"Because it was a woman that wrote it. I told by the hand, after a  while!\"    \"A woman? Go on, Bill. This story sure sounds different from most.\"    \"It ain't even started to get different yet,\" said Bill gloomily.  \"Well, that letter made me so plumb mad that I sat down and wrote  everything I could think of that a gent would say to a girl to let her  know what I thought about her. And what d'you think happened?\"    \"She wrote you back the prettiest letter you ever seen,\" suggested  Ronicky, \"saying as how she'd never meant to make you mad and that if  you--\"    \"Say,\" broke in Bill Gregg, \"did I show that letter to you?\"    \"Nope; I just was guessing at what a lot of women would do. You see?\"    \"No, I don't. I could never figure them as close as that. Anyway  that's the thing she done, right enough. She writes me a letter that  was smooth as oil and suggests that I go on with a composition course  to learn how to write.\"    \"Going to have you do books, Bill?\"    \"I ain't a plumb fool, Ronicky. But I thought it wouldn't do me no  harm to unlimber my pen and fire out a few words a day. So I done it.  I started writing what they told me to write about, the things that  was around me, with a lot of lessons about how you can't use the same  word twice on one page, and how terrible bad it is to use too many  passive verbs.\"    \"What's a passive verb, Bill?\"    \"I didn't never figure it out, exactly. However, it seems like they're  something that slows you up the way a muddy road slows up a hoss.  And then she begun talking about the mountains, and then she begun  asking--    \"About you!\" suggested Ronicky with a grin.    \"Confound you,\" said Bill Gregg. \"How come you guessed that?\"    \"I dunno. I just sort of scented what was coming.\"    \"Well, anyways, that's what she done. And pretty soon she sent me a  snapshot of herself. Well--\"    \"Lemme see it,\" said Ronicky Doone calmly.    \"I dunno just where it is, maybe,\" replied Bill Gregg.    \"Ill tell you. It's right around your neck, in that nugget locket you  wear there.\"    For a moment Bill Gregg hated the other with his eyes, and then he  submitted with a sheepish grin, took off the locket, which was made of  one big nugget rudely beaten into shape, and opened it for the benefit  of Ronicky Doone. It showed the latter not a beautiful face, but a  pretty one with a touch of honesty and pride that made her charming.    \"Well, as soon as I got that picture,\" said Bill Gregg, as he took  back the locket, \"I sure got excited. Looked to me like that girl was  made for me. A lot finer than I could ever be, you see, but simple; no  fancy frills, no raving beauty, maybe, but darned easy to look at.    \"First thing I done I went in and got a copy of my face made and  rushed it right back at her and then--\" He stopped dolefully. \"What  d'you think, Ronicky?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky; \"what happened then?\"    \"Nothing, not a thing. Not a word came back from her to answer that  letter I'd sent along.\"    \"Maybe you didn't look rich enough to suit her, Bill.\"    \"I thought that, and I thought it was my ugly face that might of made  her change her mind. I thought of pretty near everything else that was  bad about me and that she might of read in my face. Sure made me sick  for a long time. Somebody else was correcting my lessons, and that  made me sicker than ever.    \"So I sat down and wrote a letter to the head of the school and told  him I'd like to get the address of that first girl. You see, I didn't  even know her name. But I didn't get no answer.\"    Ronicky groaned. \"It don't look like the best detective in the world  could help you to find a girl when you don't know her name.\" He added  gently: \"But maybe she don't want you to find her?\"    \"I thought that for a long time. Then, a while back, I got a letter  from San Francisco, saying that she was coming on a train through  these parts and could I be in Stillwater because the train stopped  there a couple of minutes. Most like she thought Stillwater was just  sort of across the street from me. Matter of fact, I jumped on a hoss,  and it took me three days of breaking my neck to get near Stillwater  and then--\" He stopped and cast a gloomy look on his companion.    \"I know,\" said Ronicky. \"Then I come and spoiled the whole party. Sure  makes me sick to think about it.\"    \"And now she's plumb gone,\" muttered Bill Gregg. \"I thought maybe the  reason I didn't have her correcting my lessons any more was because  she'd had to leave the schools and go West. So, right after I got this  drilling through the leg, you remember, I wrote a letter?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"It was to her at the schools, but I didn't get no answer. I guess she  didn't go back there after all. She's plumb gone, Ronicky.\"    The other was silent for a moment. \"How much would you give to find  her?\" he asked suddenly.    \"Half my life,\" said Bill Gregg solemnly.    \"Then,\" said Ronicky, \"we'll make a try at it. I got an idea how we  can start on the trail. I'm going to go with you, partner. I've messed  up considerable, this little game of yours; now I'm going to do what  I can to straighten it out. Sometimes two are better than one. Anyway  I'm going to stick with you till you've found her or lost her for  good. You see?\"    Bill Gregg sighed. \"You're pretty straight, Ronicky,\" he said, \"but  what good does it do for two gents to look for a needle in a haystack?  How could we start to hit the trail?\"    \"This way. We know the train that she took. Maybe we could find the  Pullman conductor that was on it, and he might remember her. They got  good memories, some of those gents. We'll start to find him, which had  ought to be pretty easy.\"    \"Ronicky, I'd never of thought of that in a million years!\"    \"It ain't thinking that we want now, it's acting. When can you start  with me?\"    \"I'll be fit tomorrow.\"    \"Then tomorrow we start.\"          Chapter Five      _Macklin's Library_    Robert Macklin, Pullman conductor, had risen to that eminent position  so early in life that the glamour of it had not yet passed away. He  was large enough to have passed for a champion wrestler or a burly  pugilist, and he was small enough to glory in the smallest details of  his work. Having at the age of thirty, through a great deal of luck  and a touch of accident, secured his place, he possessed, at least,  sufficient dignity to fill it.    He was one of those rare men who carry their dignity with them past  the doors of their homes. Robert Macklin's home, during the short  intervals when he was off the trains, was in a tiny apartment. It was  really one not overly large room, with a little alcove adjoining; but  Robert Macklin had seized the opportunity to hang a curtain across  the alcove, and, since it was large enough to contain a chair and a  bookshelf, he referred to it always as his \"library.\"    He was this morning seated in his library, with his feet protruding  through the curtains and resting on the foot of his bed, when the  doorbell rang. He surveyed himself in his mirror before he answered  it. Having decided that, in his long dressing gown, he was imposing  enough, he advanced to the door and slowly opened it.    He saw before him two sun-darkened men whose soft gray hats proclaimed  that they were newly come out of the West. The one was a fellow whose  face had been made stern by hard work and few pleasures in life. The  other was one who, apparently, had never worked at all. There was  something about him that impressed Robert Macklin. He might be a young  Western millionaire, for instance. Aside from his hat he was dressed  with elaborate care. He wore gray spats, and his clothes were  obviously well tailored, and his necktie was done in a bow. On the  whole he was a very cool, comfortable looking chap. The handkerchief,  which protruded from his breast pocket and showed an edging of red,  was a trifle noisy; and the soft gray hat was hardly in keeping, but,  on the whole, he was a dashing-looking chap. The bagging trousers  and the blunt-toed shoes of his companion were to Robert Macklin a  distinct shock. He centered all of his attention instantly on the  younger of his"]]]
