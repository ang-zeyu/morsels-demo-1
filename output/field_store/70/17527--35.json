[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell. (#3)"],[1,"well I knew  Suspended in that Limbo many a soul  Of mighty worth.  \"O tell me, sire rever'd!  Tell me, my master!\"  I began through wish  Of full assurance in that holy faith,  Which vanquishes all error; \"say, did e'er  Any, or through his own or other's merit,  Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?\"    Piercing the secret purport of my speech,  He answer'd: \"I was new to that estate,  When I beheld a puissant one arrive  Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.  He forth the shade of our first parent drew,  Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,  Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,  Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,  Israel with his sire and with his sons,  Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,  And others many more, whom he to bliss  Exalted.  Before these, be thou assur'd,  No spirit of human kind was ever sav'd.\"    We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,  Still passing through the wood; for so I name  Those spirits thick beset.  We were not far  On this side from the summit, when I kenn'd  A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere  Prevailing shin'd.  Yet we a little space  Were distant, not so far but I in part  Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high  That place possess'd.  \"O thou, who every art  And science valu'st! who are these, that boast  Such honour, separate from all the rest?\"    He answer'd: \"The renown of their great names  That echoes through your world above, acquires  Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd.\"  Meantime a voice I heard: \"Honour the bard  Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!\"  No sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld  Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,  Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.    When thus my master kind began: \"Mark him,  Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,  The other three preceding, as their lord.  This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:  Flaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;  The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.  Because they all that appellation own,  With which the voice singly accosted me,  Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.\"    So I beheld united the bright school  Of him the monarch of sublimest song,  That o'er the others like an eagle soars.  When they together short discourse had held,  They turn'd to me, with salutation kind  Beck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:  Nor was this all; but greater honour still  They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;  And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.    Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd  Speaking of matters, then befitting well  To speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot  Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,  Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round  Defended by a pleasant stream.  O'er this  As o'er dry land we pass'd.  Next through seven gates  I with those sages enter'd, and we came  Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.    There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around  Majestically mov'd, and in their port  Bore eminent authority; they spake  Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.    We to one side retir'd, into a place  Open and bright and lofty, whence each one  Stood manifest to view.  Incontinent  There on the green enamel of the plain  Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight  I am exalted in my own esteem.    Electra there I saw accompanied  By many, among whom Hector I knew,  Anchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye  Caesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there  Penthesilea.  On the other side  Old King Latinus, seated by his child  Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,  Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife  Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;  And sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.    Then when a little more I rais'd my brow,  I spied the master of the sapient throng,  Seated amid the philosophic train.  Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence due.  There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,  Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,  Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,  With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,  And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,  Zeno, and Dioscorides well read  In nature's secret lore.  Orpheus I mark'd  And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,  Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,  Galenus, Avicen, and him who made  That commentary vast, Averroes.    Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;  For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes  My words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two  The six associates part.  Another way  My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,  Into a climate ever vex'd with storms:  And to a part I come where no light shines.          CANTO V    FROM the first circle I descended thus  Down to the second, which, a lesser space  Embracing, so much more of grief contains  Provoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands  Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all  Who enter, strict examining the crimes,    Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,  According as he foldeth him around:  For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,  It all confesses; and that judge severe  Of sins, considering what place in hell  Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft  Himself encircles, as degrees beneath  He dooms it to descend.  Before him stand  Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn  Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears  His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.    \"O thou! who to this residence of woe  Approachest?\"  when he saw me coming, cried  Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,  \"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom  Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad  Deceive thee to thy harm.\"  To him my guide:  \"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way  By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd  Where will and power are one.  Ask thou no more.\"    Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.  Now am I come where many a plaining voice  Smites on mine ear.  Into a place I came  Where light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd  A noise as of a sea in tempest torn  By warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell  With restless fury drives the spirits on  Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.    When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,  There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,  And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.    I understood that to this torment sad  The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom  Reason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops  And multitudinous, when winter reigns,  The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;  So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.  On this side and on that, above, below,  It drives them: hope of rest to solace them  Is none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,  Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,  Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld  Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on  By their dire doom.  Then I: \"Instructor! who  Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?\"--\"The first  'Mong those, of whom thou question'st,\" he replied,  \"O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice  Of luxury was so shameless, that she made  Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,  To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.  This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,  That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;  And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.  The next in amorous fury slew herself,  And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:  Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.\"    There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long  The time was fraught with evil; there the great  Achilles, who with love fought to the end.  Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside  A thousand more he show'd me, and by name  Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.    When I had heard my sage instructor name  Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd  By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind  Was lost; and I began: \"Bard! willingly  I would address those two together coming,  Which seem so light before the wind.\"  He thus:  \"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.\"    \"Then by that love which carries them along,  Entreat; and they will come.\"  Soon as the wind  Sway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:  \"O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse  With us, if by none else restrain'd.\"  As doves  By fond desire invited, on wide wings  And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,  Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;  Thus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,  They through the ill air speeding; with such force  My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.    \"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st  Visiting, through this element obscure,  Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;  If for a friend the King of all we own'd,  Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,  Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.  ()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse  It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that  Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,  As now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,  Is situate on the coast, where Po descends  To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.    \"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,  Entangled him by that fair form, from me  Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:  Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,  Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,  That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.    \"Love brought us to one death: Caina waits  The soul, who spilt our life.\"  Such were their words;  At hearing which downward I bent my looks,  And held them there so long, that the bard cried:  \"What art thou pond'ring?\"  I in answer thus:  \"Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire  Must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!\"    Then turning, I to them my speech address'd.  And thus began: \"Francesca! your sad fate  Even to tears my grief and pity moves.  But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,  By what, and how love granted, that ye knew  Your yet uncertain wishes?\"  She replied:  \"No greater grief than to remember days  Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens  Thy learn'd"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#3)"],[1,"centre drawn.  I wearied thus began: \"Parent belov'd!  Turn, and behold how I remain alone,  If thou stay not.\"--\" My son!\"  He straight reply'd,  \"Thus far put forth thy strength;\" and to a track  Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round  Circles the hill.  His words so spurr'd me on,  That I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,  Till my feet press'd the circuit plain beneath.  There both together seated, turn'd we round  To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft  Many beside have with delight look'd back.    First on the nether shores I turn'd my eyes,  Then rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd  That from the left it smote us.  Soon perceiv'd  That Poet sage now at the car of light  Amaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north  Its course it enter'd.  Whence he thus to me:  \"Were Leda's offspring now in company  Of that broad mirror, that high up and low  Imparts his light beneath, thou might'st behold  The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears  Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.  How that may be if thou would'st think; within  Pond'ring, imagine Sion with this mount  Plac'd on the earth, so that to both be one  Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,  Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew  To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see  How of necessity by this on one  He passes, while by that on the' other side,  If with clear view shine intellect attend.\"    \"Of truth, kind teacher!\"  I exclaim'd, \"so clear  Aught saw I never, as I now discern  Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb  Of the supernal motion (which in terms  Of art is called the Equator, and remains  Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause  Thou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north  Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land  Inhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.  But if it please thee, I would gladly know,  How far we have to journey: for the hill  Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.\"    He thus to me: \"Such is this steep ascent,  That it is ever difficult at first,  But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.  When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much  That upward going shall be easy to thee.  As in a vessel to go down the tide,  Then of this path thou wilt have reach'd the end.  There hope to rest thee from thy toil.  No more  I answer, and thus far for certain know.\"  As he his words had spoken, near to us  A voice there sounded: \"Yet ye first perchance  May to repose you by constraint be led.\"  At sound thereof each turn'd, and on the left  A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I  Nor he before was ware.  Thither we drew,  find there were some, who in the shady place  Behind the rock were standing, as a man  Thru' idleness might stand.  Among them one,  Who seem'd to me much wearied, sat him down,  And with his arms did fold his knees about,  Holding his face between them downward bent.    \"Sweet Sir!\"  I cry'd, \"behold that man, who shows  Himself more idle, than if laziness  Were sister to him.\"  Straight he turn'd to us,  And, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observ'd,  Then in these accents spake: \"Up then, proceed  Thou valiant one.\"  Straight who it was I knew;  Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath  Still somewhat urg'd me) hinder my approach.  And when I came to him, he scarce his head  Uplifted, saying \"Well hast thou discern'd,  How from the left the sun his chariot leads.\"    His lazy acts and broken words my lips  To laughter somewhat mov'd; when I began:  \"Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.  But tell, why thou art seated upright there?  Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?  Or blame I only shine accustom'd ways?\"  Then he: \"My brother, of what use to mount,  When to my suffering would not let me pass  The bird of God, who at the portal sits?  Behooves so long that heav'n first bear me round  Without its limits, as in life it bore,  Because I to the end repentant Sighs  Delay'd, if prayer do not aid me first,  That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.  What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?\"'    Before me now the Poet up the mount  Ascending, cried: \"Haste thee, for see the sun  Has touch'd the point meridian, and the night  Now covers with her foot Marocco's shore.\"          CANTO V    Now had I left those spirits, and pursued  The steps of my Conductor, when beheld  Pointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:  \"See how it seems as if the light not shone  From the left hand of him beneath, and he,  As living, seems to be led on.\"  Mine eyes  I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze  Through wonder first at me, and then at me  And the light broken underneath, by turns.  \"Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?\"  my guide  Exclaim'd, \"that thou hast slack'd thy pace? or how  Imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?  Come after me, and to their babblings leave  The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,  Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!  He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,  Still of his aim is wide, in that the one  Sicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength.\"    What other could I answer save \"I come?\"  I said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd  Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.    Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,  A little way before us, some who sang  The \"Miserere\" in responsive Strains.  When they perceiv'd that through my body I  Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song  Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;  And two of them, in guise of messengers,  Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:  \"Of your condition we would gladly learn.\"    To them my guide.  \"Ye may return, and bear  Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame  Is real flesh.  If, as I deem, to view  His shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them.  Him let them honour, they may prize him well.\"    Ne'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed  Cut through the serene air at fall of night,  Nor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,  That upward these did not in shorter space  Return; and, there arriving, with the rest  Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.    \"Many,\" exclaim'd the bard, \"are these, who throng  Around us: to petition thee they come.  Go therefore on, and listen as thou go'st.\"    \"O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness  With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.\"  Shouting they came, \"a little rest thy step.  Look if thou any one amongst our tribe  Hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there  Thou mayst report.  Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?  Ah wherefore tarriest thou not?  We all  By violence died, and to our latest hour  Were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,  So that, repenting and forgiving, we  Did issue out of life at peace with God,  Who with desire to see him fills our heart.\"    Then I: \"The visages of all I scan  Yet none of ye remember.  But if aught,  That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!  Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,  Which on the steps of guide so excellent  Following from world to world intent I seek.\"    In answer he began: \"None here distrusts  Thy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;  So as the will fail not for want of power.  Whence I, who sole before the others speak,  Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,  Which lies between Romagna and the realm  Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray  Those who inhabit Fano, that for me  Their adorations duly be put up,  By which I may purge off my grievous sins.  From thence I came.  But the deep passages,  Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,  Upon my bosom in Antenor's land  Were made, where to be more secure I thought.  The author of the deed was Este's prince,  Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath  Pursued me.  Had I towards Mira fled,  When overta'en at Oriaco, still  Might I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,  And in the mire and rushes tangled there  Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.\"    Then said another: \"Ah! so may the wish,  That takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,  As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.  Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:  Giovanna nor none else have care for me,  Sorrowing with these I therefore go.\"  I thus:  \"From Campaldino's field what force or chance  Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?\"    \"Oh!\"  answer'd he, \"at Casentino's foot  A stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung  In Apennine above the Hermit's seat.  E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,  Pierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,  And bloodying the plain.  Here sight and speech  Fail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name  I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.  I will report the truth; which thou again  Tell to the living.  Me God's angel took,  Whilst he of hell exclaim'd: \"O thou from heav'n!  Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me?  Thou of him  Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away  For one poor tear that he deprives me of.  But of the other, other rule I make.\"    \"Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects  That vapour dank, returning into water,  Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.  That evil will, which in his intellect  Still follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind  And smoky mist, by virtue of the power  Given by his nature.  Thence the valley, soon  As day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud  From Pratomagno to the mountain range,  And stretch'd the sky above, so that the air  Impregnate chang'd to water.  Fell the rain,  And to the fosses came all that the land  Contain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,  To the great river with such headlong sweep  Rush'd, that nought stay'd its course.  My stiffen'd frame  Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,  And dash'd it into Arno, from my breast  Loos'ning the cross, that of myself I made  When overcome with pain.  He hurl'd me on,  Along the banks and bottom of his course;  Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.\"    \"Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,  And rested after thy long road,\" so spake  "]]]
