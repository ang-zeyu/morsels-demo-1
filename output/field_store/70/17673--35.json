Thou art decked with a pair of well-made ears graced with excellent  rings. O Goddess, thou shinest with a face that challengeth the moon in  beauty. With an excellent diadem and beautiful braid with robes made of  the bodies of snakes, and with also the brilliant girdle round thy hips,  thou shinest like the Mandara mountain encircled with snakes. Thou  shinest also with peacock-plumes standing erect on thy head, and thou  hast sanctified the celestial regions by adopting the vow of perpetual  maiden-hood. It is for this, O thou that hast slain the  _Mahishasura_,[9] that thou art praised and worshipped by the gods for  the protection of the three worlds. O thou foremost of all deities,  extend to me thy grace, show me thy mercy, and be thou the source of  blessings to me. Thou art _Jaya_ and _Vijaya_, and it is thou that  givest victory in battle. Grant me victory, O Goddess, and give me boons  also at this hour of distress. Thy eternal abode is on Vindhya--that  foremost of mountains. O _Kali_, O _Kali_, thou art the great _Kali_,  ever fond of wine and meat and animal sacrifice. Capable of going  everywhere at will, and bestowing boons on thy devotees, thou art ever  followed in thy journeys by Brahma and the other gods. By them that call  upon thee for the relief of their burdens, and by them also that bow to  thee at daybreak on Earth, there is nothing that cannot be attained in  respect either of offspring or wealth. And because thou rescuest people  from difficulties whether when they are afflicted in the wilderness or  sinking in the great ocean, it is for this that thou art called  _Durga_[10] by all. Thou art the sole refuge of men when attacked by  robbers or while afflicted in crossing streams and seas or in wilderness  and forests. Those men that remember thee are never prostrated, O great  Goddess. Thou art Fame, thou art Prosperity, thou art Steadiness, thou  art Success; thou art the Wife, thou art men's Offspring, thou art  Knowledge, and thou art the Intellect. Thou art the two Twilights, the  Night Sleep, Light--both solar and lunar, Beauty, Forgiveness, Mercy,  and every other thing. Thou dispellest, worshipped by the devotees their  fetters, ignorance, loss of children and loss of wealth, disease, death,  and fear. I, who have been deprived of my kingdom, seek thy protection.  And as I bow to thee with bended head, O Supreme Goddess, grant me  protection, O thou of eyes like lotus leaves. And be thou as boon-giving  Truth unto us that are acting according to Truth. And, O Durga, kind as  thou art unto all that seek thy protection, and affectionate unto all  thy devotees, grant me protection!'\"        [9] _Mahishasura_, the son of Rambhasura. Durga had to fight for      many years before she could slay this formidable _Asura_.      The story occurs in the _Markandeya Purana_. To this day, Bengal      during the great Durga Puja festival in autumn, worships the      goddess with great veneration.        [10] Literally, one that rescues from difficulty.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus praised by the son of Pandu, the Goddess  showed herself unto him. And approaching the king, she addressed him in  these words, 'O mighty armed king, listen, O Lord, to these words of  mine. Having vanquished and slain the ranks of the Kauravas through my  grace, victory in battle will soon be thine. Thou shalt again lord it  over the entire Earth, having made thy dominions destitute of thorns.  And, O king, thou shalt also, with thy brothers, obtain great happiness.  And through my grace, joy and health will be thine. And they also in the  world who will recite my attributes and achievements will be freed from  their sins, and gratified. I will bestow upon them kingdom, long life,  beauty of person, and offspring. And they, O king, who will invoke me,  after thy manner, in exile or in the city, in the midst of battle or of  dangers from foes, in forests or in inaccessible deserts, in seas or  mountain fastnesses, there is nothing that they will not obtain in this  world. And ye sons of Pandu, he will achieve success in every business  of his that will listen to, or himself recite with devotion, this  excellent hymn. And through my grace neither the Kuru's spies, nor those  that dwell in the country of the Matsyas, will succeed in recognising  you all as long as ye reside in Virata's city!' And having said these  words unto Yudhishthira, that chastiser of foes, and having arranged for  the protection of the sons of Pandu, the Goddess disappeared there and  then.\"      SECTION VII    Vaisampayana said, \"Then tying up in his cloth dice made of gold and set  with _lapis lazuli_, and holding them below his arm-pit, king  Yudhishthira,--that illustrious lord of men--that high-souled  perpetuator of the Kuru race, regarded by kings, irrepressible in might,  and like unto a snake of virulent poison,--that bull among men, endued  with strength and beauty and prowess, and possessed of greatness, and  resembling in form a celestial though now like unto the sun enveloped in  dense clouds, or fire covered with ashes, first made his appearance when  the famous king Virata was seated in his court. And beholding with his  followers that son of Pandu in his court, looking like the moon hid in  clouds and possessed of a face beautiful as the full moon, king Virata  addressed his counsellors and the twice-born ones and the charioteers  and the Vaisyas and others, saying, 'Enquire ye who it is, so like a  king that looketh on my court for the first time. He cannot be a  Brahmana. Methinks he is a man of men, and a lord of earth. He hath  neither slaves, nor cars, nor elephants with him, yet he shineth like  the very Indra. The marks on his person indicate him to be one whose  coronal locks have undergone the sacred investiture. Even this is my  belief. He approacheth me without any hesitation, even as an elephant in  rut approacheth an assemblage of lotuses!'    \"And as the king was indulging in these thoughts, that bull among men,  Yudhishthira, came before Virata and addressed him, saying, 'O great  king, know me for a Brahmana who, having lost his all hath come to thee  for the means of subsistence. I desire, O sinless one, to live here  beside thee acting under thy commands,[11] O lord.' The king then,  well-pleased, replied unto him saying, 'Thou art welcome. Do thou then  accept the appointment thou seekest!' And having appointed the lion  among kings in the post he had prayed for, king Virata addressed him  with a glad heart, saying, 'O child, I ask thee from affection, from the  dominions of what king dost thou come hither? Tell me also truly what is  thy name and family, and what thou hast a knowledge of.'        [11] _Kamachara_ is explained by Nilakantha thus, although in      other places it bears a quite different meaning.    \"Yudhishthira said, 'My name is Kanka, and I am a Brahmana belonging to  the family known by the name of _Vaiyaghra_. I am skilled in casting  dice, and formerly I was a friend of Yudhishthira.'    \"Virata replied, 'I will grant thee whatever boon thou mayst desire. Do  thou rule the Matsyas.--I shall remain in submission to thee. Even  cunning gamblers are liked by me. Thou, on the other hand, art like a  god, and deservest a kingdom.'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'My first prayer, O lord of earth, is that I may not  be involved in any dispute (on account of dice) with low people.  Further, a person defeated by me (at dice) shall not be permitted to  retain the wealth (won by me). Let this boon be granted to me through  thy grace.'    \"Virata replied, 'I shall certainly slay him who may happen to displease  thee, and should he be one of the twice-born ones, I shall banish him  from my dominions. Let the assembled subjects listen! Kanka is as much  lord of this realm as I myself. Thou (Kanka) shalt be my friend and  shalt ride the same vehicles as I. And there shall also be at thy  disposal apparel in plenty, and various kinds of viands and drinks. And  thou shalt look into my affairs, both internal and external. And for  thee all my doors shall be open. When men out of employ or of strained  circumstances will apply to thee, do thou at all hours bring their words  unto me, and I will surely give them whatever they desire. No fear shall  be thine as long as thou residest with me.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Having thus obtained an interview with Virata's  king, and received from him boons, that heroic bull among men, began to  live happily, highly regarded by all. Nor could any one discover him as  he lived there.\"      SECTION VIII    Vaisampayana said, \"Then another endued with the dreadful strength and  blazing in beauty, approached king Virata, with the playful gait of the  lion. And holding in hand a cooking ladle and a spoon, as also an  unsheathed sword of sable hue and without a spot on the blade, he came  in the guise of a cook illumining all around him by his splendour like  the sun discovering the whole world. And attired in black and possessed  of the strength of the king of mountains, he approached the king of the  Matsyas and stood before him. And beholding that king-like person before  him, Virata addressed his assembled subjects saying, 'Who is that youth,  that bull among men, with shoulders broad like those of a lion, and so  exceedingly beautiful? That person, never seen before, is like the sun.  Revolving the matter in my mind, I cannot ascertain who he is, nor can I  with even serious thoughts guess the intention of that bull among men  (in coming here). Beholding him, it seems to me that he is either the  king of the Gandharvas, or Purandara himself. Do ye ascertain who it is  that standeth before my eyes. Let him have quickly what he seeks.' Thus  commanded by king Virata, his swift-footed messengers went up to the son  of Kunti and informed that younger brother of Yudhishthira of everything  the king had said. Then the high-souled son of Pandu, approaching  Virata, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#4)"],[1,"as boldly as he had done the  sycophants of Bonaparte.    Most noteworthy of the minor writings of this period is _Dr.  Katzenberger's Journey to the Baths_, published in 1809. The effect of  this rollicking satire on affectation and estheticism was to arouse a  more manly spirit in the nation and so it helped to prepare for the  way of liberation. The patriotic youth of Germany now began to speak  and think of Richter as Jean Paul the Unique. In the years that follow  Waterloo every little journey that Richter took was made the occasion  of public receptions and festivities. Meanwhile life in the Bayreuth  home grew somewhat strained. Both partners might well have heeded  _Levana's_ counsel that \"Men should show more love, women more common  sense.\"    Of Richter's last decade two books only call for notice here, _Truth  about Jean Paul's Life_, a fragment of autobiography written in 1819,  and _The Comet_, a novel, also unfinished, published at intervals from  1820 to 1822. Hitherto, said Richter of _The Comet_, he had paid too  great deference to rule, \"like a child born curled and forthwith  stretched on a swathing cushion.\" Now, in his maturity, he will, he  says, let himself go; and a wild tale he makes of it, exuberant in  fancy, rich in comedy, unbridled in humor. The Autobiography extends  only to Schwarzenbach and his confirmation, but of all his writings it  has perhaps the greatest charm.    Richter's last years were clouded by disease, mental and physical, and  by the death of his son Max. A few weeks before his own death he  arranged for an edition of his complete works, for which he was to  receive 35,000 thaler ($26,000). For this he sought a special  privilege, copyright being then very imperfect in Germany, on the  ground that in all his works not one line could be found to offend  religion or virtue.    He died on November 14, 1825. On the evening of November 17 was the  funeral. Civil and military, state and city officials took part in it.  On the bier was borne the unfinished manuscript of _Selina_, an essay  on immortality. Sixty students with lighted torches escorted the  procession. Other students bore, displayed, _Levana_ and the  _Introduction to Esthetics_.    Sixteen years after Richter's death the King of Bavaria erected a  statue to him in Bayreuth. But his most enduring monument had already  long been raised in the funeral oration by Ludwig Boerne at Frankfurt.  \"A Star has set,\" said the orator, \"and the eye of this century will  close before it rises again, for bright genius moves in wide orbits  and our distant descendants will be first again to bid glad welcome  to that from which their fathers have taken sad leave. * * * We shall  mourn for him whom we have lost and for those others who have not lost  him, for he has not lived for all. Yet a time will come when he shall  be born for all and all will lament him. But he will stand patient on  the threshold of the twentieth century and wait smiling till his  creeping people shall come to join him.\"          QUINTUS FIXLEIN'S WEDDING[1]    From _The Life of Quintus Fixlein_ (1796)    By JEAN PAUL    TRANSLATED BY T. CARLYLE    At the sound of the morning prayer-bell, the bridegroom--for the din  of preparation was disturbing his quiet orison--went out into the  churchyard, which (as in many other places) together with the church,  lay round his mansion like a court. Here, on the moist green, over  whose closed flowers the churchyard wall was still spreading broad  shadows, did his spirit cool itself from the warm dreams of Earth:  here, where the white flat grave-stone of his Teacher lay before him  like the fallen-in door of the Janus-temple of life, or like the  windward side of the narrow house, turned toward the tempests of the  world: here, where the little shrunk metallic door on the grated cross  of his father uttered to him the inscriptions of death, and the year  when his parent departed, and all the admonitions and mementos, graven  on the lead--there, I say, his mood grew softer and more solemn; and  he now lifted up by heart his morning prayer, which usually he read,  and entreated God to bless him in his office, and to spare his  mother's life, and to look with favor and acceptance on the purpose of  today. Then, over the graves, he walked into his fenceless little  angular flower-garden; and here, composed and confident in the divine  keeping, he pressed the stalks of his tulips deeper into the mellow  earth.    But on returning to the house, he was met on all hands by the  bell-ringing and the Janizary-music of wedding-gladness; the  marriage-guests had all thrown off their nightcaps, and were drinking  diligently; there was a clattering, a cooking, a frizzling;  tea-services, coffee-services, and warm beer-services, were advancing  in succession; and plates full of bride-cakes were going round like  potter's frames or cistern-wheels. The Schoolmaster, with three young  lads, was heard rehearsing from his own house an _Arioso_, with which,  so soon as they were perfect, he purposed to surprise his clerical  superior. But now rushed all the arms of the foaming joy-streams into  one, when the sky-queen besprinkled with blossoms the bride, descended  upon Earth in her timid joy, full of quivering, humble love; when the  bells began; when the procession-column set forth with the whole village  round and before it; when the organ, the congregation, the officiating  priest, and the sparrows on the trees of the church-window, struck louder  and louder their rolling peals on the drum of the jubilee-festival.    * * * The heart of the singing bridegroom was like to leap from its  place for joy \"that on his bridal-day it was all so respectable and  grand.\" Not till the marriage benediction could he pray a little.    Still worse and louder grew the business during dinner, when  pastry-work and march-pane-devices were brought forward, when glasses,  and slain fishes (laid under the napkins to frighten the guests) went  round, and when the guests rose and themselves went round, and, at  length, danced round: for they had instrumental music from the city  there.    One minute handed over to the other the sugar-bowl and bottle-case of  joy: the guests heard and saw less and less, and the villagers began  to see and hear more and more, and toward night they penetrated like a  wedge into the open door--nay, two youths ventured even in the middle  of the parsonage-court to mount a plank over a beam and commence  seesawing. Out of doors, the gleaming vapor of the departed sun was  encircling the earth, the evening-star was glittering over parsonage  and churchyard; no one heeded it.    However, about nine o'clock, when the marriage-guests had well nigh  forgotten the marriage-pair, and were drinking or dancing along for  their own behoof; when poor mortals, in this sunshine of Fate, like  fishes in the sunshine of the sky, were leaping up from their wet  cold element; and when the bridegroom under the star of happiness and  love, casting like a comet its long train of radiance over all his  heaven, had in secret pressed to his joy-filled breast his bride and  his mother--then did he lock a slice of wedding-bread privily into a  press, in the old superstitious belief that this residue secured  continuance of bread for the whole marriage. As he returned, with  greater love for the sole partner of his life, she herself met him  with his mother, to deliver him in private the bridal-nightgown and  bridal-shirt, as is the ancient usage. Many a countenance grows pale  in violent emotions, even of joy. Thiennette's wax-face was bleaching  still whiter under the sunbeams of Happiness. O, never fall, thou lily  of Heaven, and may four springs instead of four seasons open and shut  thy flower-bells to the sun! All the arms of his soul, as he floated  on the sea of joy, were quivering to clasp the soft warm heart of his  beloved, to encircle it gently and fast, and draw it to his own.    He led her from the crowded dancing-room into the cool evening. Why  does the evening, does the night, put warmer love in our hearts? Is it  the nightly pressure of helplessness or is it the exalting separation  from the turmoil of life--that veiling of the world, in which for the  soul nothing more remains but souls;--is it therefore that the letters  in which the loved name stands written on our spirit appear, like  phosphorus-writing, by night, _in fire_, while by day in their  _cloudy_ traces they but smoke?    He walked with his bride into the Castle garden: she hastened quickly  through the Castle, and past its servants' hall, where the fair flowers  of her young life had been crushed broad and dry, under a long dreary  pressure; and her soul expanded and breathed in the free open garden,  on whose flowery soil destiny had cast forth the first seeds of the  blossoms which today were gladdening her existence. Still Eden! Green  flower-chequered _chiaroscuro_! The moon is sleeping under ground  like a dead one; but beyond the garden the sun's red evening-clouds  have fallen down like rose-leaves; and the evening-star, the brideman  of the sun, hovers, like a glancing butterfly, above the rosy red,  and, modest as a bride, deprives no single starlet of its light.    [Illustration: BRIDAL PROCESSION _From the Painting by Ludwig Richter_]    The wandering pair arrived at the old gardener's hut, now standing  locked and dumb, with dark windows in the light garden, like a  fragment of the Past surviving in the Present. Bared twigs of trees  were folding, with clammy half-formed leaves, over the thick  intertwisted tangles of the bushes. The Spring was standing, like a  conqueror, with Winter at his feet. In the blue pond, now bloodless, a  dusky evening sky lay hollowed out, and the gushing waters were  moistening the flower-beds. The silver sparks of stars were rising on  the altar of the East, and, falling down, were extinguished in the red  sea of"]]]
