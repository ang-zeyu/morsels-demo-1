What did my brother tell  you?\" asked Mrs. Zane, anxiously.    \"We are in for more trouble from the Wyandots and Shawnees. But,  Bessie, I don't believe it will come soon. We are too well protected  here for anything but a protracted siege.\"    Colonel Zane's light and rather evasive answer did not deceive his  wife. She knew her brother and her husband would not wear anxious  faces for nothing. Her usually bright face clouded with a look of  distress. She had seen enough of Indian warfare to make her shudder  with horror at the mere thought. Betty seemed unconcerned. She sat  down beside the dog and patted him on the head.    \"Tige, Indians! Indians!\" she said.    The dog growled and showed his teeth. It was only necessary to  mention Indians to arouse his ire.    \"The dog has been uneasy of late,\" continued Colonel Zane \"He found  the Indian tracks before Wetzel did. You know how Tige hates  Indians. Ever since he came home with Isaac four years ago he has  been of great service to the scouts, as he possesses so much  intelligence and sagacity. Tige followed Isaac home the last time he  escaped from the Wyandots. When Isaac was in captivity he nursed and  cared for the dog after he had been brutally beaten by the redskins.  Have you ever heard that long mournful howl Tige gives out sometimes  in the dead of night?\"    \"Yes I have, and it makes me cover up my head,\" said Betty.    \"Well, it is Tige mourning for Isaac,\" said Colonel Zane    \"Poor Isaac,\" murmured Betty.    \"Do you remember him? It has been nine years since you saw him,\"  said Mrs. Zane.    \"Remember Isaac? Indeed I do. I shall never forget him. I wonder if  he is still living?\"    \"Probably not. It is now four years since he was recaptured. I think  it would have been impossible to keep him that length of time,  unless, of course, he has married that Indian girl. The simplicity  of the Indian nature is remarkable. He could easily have deceived  them and made them believe he was content in captivity. Probably, in  attempting to escape again, he has been killed as was poor Andrew.\"    Brother and sister gazed with dark, sad eyes into the fire, now  burned down to a glowing bed of coals. The silence remained unbroken  save for the moan of the rising wind outside, the rattle of hail,  and the patter of rain drops on the roof.        CHAPTER II.    Fort Henry stood on a bluff overlooking the river and commanded a  fine view of the surrounding country. In shape it was a  parallelogram, being about three hundred and fifty-six feet in  length, and one hundred and fifty in width. Surrounded by a stockade  fence twelve feet high, with a yard wide walk running around the  inside, and with bastions at each corner large enough to contain six  defenders, the fort presented an almost impregnable defense. The  blockhouse was two stories in height, the second story projecting  out several feet over the first. The thick white oak walls bristled  with portholes. Besides the blockhouse, there were a number of  cabins located within the stockade. Wells had been sunk inside the  inclosure, so that if the spring happened to go dry, an abundance of  good water could be had at all times.    In all the histories of frontier life mention is made of the forts  and the protection they offered in time of savage warfare. These  forts were used as homes for the settlers, who often lived for weeks  inside the walls.    Forts constructed entirely of wood without the aid of a nail or  spike (for the good reason that these things could not be had) may  seem insignificant in these days of great nasal and military  garrisons. However, they answered the purpose at that time and  served to protect many an infant settlement from the savage attacks  of Indian tribes. During a siege of Fort Henry, which had occurred  about a year previous, the settlers would have lost scarcely a man  had they kept to the fort. But Captain Ogle, at that time in charge  of the garrison, had led a company out in search of the Indians.  Nearly all of his men were killed, several only making their way to  the fort.    On the day following Major McColloch's arrival at Fort Henry, the  settlers had been called in from their spring plowing and other  labors, and were now busily engaged in moving their stock and the  things they wished to save from the destructive torch of the  redskin. The women had their hands full with the children, the  cleaning of rifles and moulding of bullets, and the thousand and one  things the sterner tasks of their husbands had left them. Major  McColloch, Jonathan and Silas Zane, early in the day, had taken  different directions along the river to keep a sharp lookout for  signs of the enemy. Colonel Zane intended to stay in his oven house  and defend it, so he had not moved anything to the fort excepting  his horses and cattle. Old Sam, the negro, was hauling loads of hay  inside the stockade. Captain Boggs had detailed several scouts to  watch the roads and one of these was the young man, Clarke, who had  accompanied the Major from Fort Pitt.    The appearance of Alfred Clarke, despite the fact that he wore the  regulation hunting garb, indicated a young man to whom the hard work  and privation of the settler were unaccustomed things. So thought  the pioneers who noticed his graceful walk, his fair skin and smooth  hands. Yet those who carefully studied his clearcut features were  favorably impressed; the women, by the direct, honest gaze of his  blue eyes and the absence of ungentle lines in his face; the men, by  the good nature, and that indefinable something by which a man marks  another as true steel.    He brought nothing with him from Fort Pitt except his horse, a  black-coated, fine limbed thoroughbred, which he frankly confessed  was all he could call his own. When asking Colonel Zane to give him  a position in the garrison he said he was a Virginian and had been  educated in Philadelphia; that after his father died his mother  married again, and this, together with a natural love of adventure,  had induced him to run away and seek his fortune with the hardy  pioneer and the cunning savage of the border. Beyond a few months'  service under General Clark he knew nothing of frontier life; but he  was tired of idleness; he was strong and not afraid of work, and he  could learn. Colonel Zane, who prided himself on his judgment of  character, took a liking to the young man at once, and giving him a  rifle and accoutrements, told him the border needed young men of  pluck and fire, and that if he brought a strong hand and a willing  heart he could surely find fortune. Possibly if Alfred Clarke could  have been told of the fate in store for him he might have mounted  his black steed and have placed miles between him and the frontier  village; but, as there were none to tell, he went cheerfully out to  meet that fate.    On this is bright spring morning he patrolled the road leading along  the edge of the clearing, which was distant a quarter of a mile from  the fort. He kept a keen eye on the opposite side of the river, as  he had been directed. From the upper end of the island, almost  straight across from where he stood, the river took a broad turn,  which could not be observed from the fort windows. The river was  high from the recent rains and brush heaps and logs and debris of  all descriptions were floating down with the swift current. Rabbits  and other small animals, which had probably been surrounded on some  island and compelled to take to the brush or drown, crouched on  floating logs and piles of driftwood. Happening to glance down the  road, Clarke saw a horse galloping in his direction. At first he  thought it was a messenger for himself, but as it neared him he saw  that the horse was an Indian pony and the rider a young girl, whose  long, black hair was flying in the wind.    \"Hello! I wonder what the deuce this is? Looks like an Indian girl,\"  said Clarke to himself. \"She rides well, whoever she may be.\"    He stepped behind a clump of laurel bushes near the roadside and  waited. Rapidly the horse and rider approached him. When they were  but a few paces distant he sprang out and, as the pony shied and  reared at sight of him, he clutched the bridle and pulled the pony's  head down. Looking up he encountered the astonished and bewildered  gaze from a pair of the prettiest dark eyes it had ever been his  fortune, or misfortune, to look into.    Betty, for it was she, looked at the young man in amazement, while  Alfred was even more surprised and disconcerted. For a moment they  looked at each other in silence. But Betty, who was scarcely ever at  a loss for words, presently found her voice.    \"Well, sir! What does this mean?\" she asked indignantly.    \"It means that you must turn around and go back to the fort,\"  answered Alfred, also recovering himself.    Now Betty's favorite ride happened to be along this road. It lay  along the top of the bluff a mile or more and afforded a fine  unobstructed view of the river. Betty had either not heard of the  Captain's order, that no one was to leave the fort, or she had  disregarded it altogether; probably the latter, as she generally did  what suited her fancy.    \"Release my pony's head!\" she cried, her face flushing, as she gave  a jerk to the reins. \"How dare you? What right have you to detain  me?\"    The expression Betty saw on Clarke's face was not new to her, for  she remembered having seen it on the faces of young gentlemen whom  she had met at her aunt's house in Philadelphia. It was the slight,  provoking smile of the man familiar with the various moods of young  women, the expression of an amused contempt for their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#4)"],[1,"and about the doors  were lank brown men very like Naab's sons. Some wore sheepskin \"chaps,\"  some blue overalls; all wore boots and spurs, wide soft hats, and in  their belts, far to the back, hung large Colt's revolvers.    \"We'll buy what you need, just as if you expected to ride the ranges for  me to-morrow,\" said Naab. \"The first thing we ask a new man is, can he  ride? Next, can he shoot?\"    \"I could ride before I got so weak. I've never handled a revolver, but I  can shoot a rifle. Never shot at anything except targets, and it seemed  to come natural for me to hit them.\"    \"Good. We'll show you some targets--lions, bears, deer, cats, wolves.  There's a fine forty-four Winchester here that my friend Abe has been  trying to sell. It has a long barrel and weighs eight pounds. Our desert  riders like the light carbines that go easy on a saddle. Most of the  mustangs aren't weight-carriers. This rifle has a great range; I've shot  it, and it's just the gun for you to use on wolves and coyotes. You'll  need a Colt and a saddle, too.\"    \"By-the-way,\" he went on, as they mounted the store steps, \"here's the  kind of money we use in this country.\" He handed Hare a slip of blue  paper, a written check for a sum of money, signed, but without register  of bank or name of firm. \"We don't use real money,\" he added. \"There's  very little coin or currency in southern Utah. Most of the Gentiles  lately come in have money, and some of us Mormons have a bag or two of  gold, but scarcely any of it gets into circulation. We use these checks,  which go from man to man sometimes for six months. The roundup of a  check means sheep, cattle, horses, grain, merchandise or labor. Every  man gets his real money's value without paying out an actual cent.\"    \"Such a system at least means honest men,\" said Hare, laughing his  surprise.    They went into a wide door to tread a maze of narrow aisles between  boxes and barrels, stacks of canned vegetables, and piles of harness and  dry goods; they entered an open space where several men leaned on a  counter.    \"Hello, Abe,\" said Naab; \"seen anything of Snap?\"    \"Hello, August. Yes, Snap's inside. So's Holderness. Says he rode in off  the range on purpose to see you.\" Abe designated an open doorway from  which issued loud voices. Hare glanced into a long narrow room full of  smoke and the fumes of rum. Through the haze he made out a crowd of men  at a rude bar. Abe went to the door and called out: \"Hey, Snap, your dad  wants you. Holderness, here's August Naab.\"    A man staggered up the few steps leading to the store and swayed in. His  long face had a hawkish cast, and it was gray, not with age, but with  the sage-gray of the desert. His eyes were of the same hue, cold yet  burning with little fiery flecks in their depths. He appeared short of  stature because of a curvature of the spine, but straightened up he  would have been tall. He wore a blue flannel shirt, and blue overalls;  round his lean hips was a belt holding two Colt's revolvers, their  heavy, dark butts projecting outward, and he had on high boots with  long, cruel spurs.    \"Howdy, father?\" he said.    \"I'm packing to-day,\" returned August Naab. \"We ride out to-morrow. I  need your help.\"    \"All-l right. When I get my pinto from Larsen.\"    \"Never mind Larsen. If he got the better of you let the matter drop.\"    \"Jeff got my pinto for a mustang with three legs. If I hadn't been drunk  I'd never have traded. So I'm looking for Jeff.\"    He bit out the last words with a peculiar snap of his long teeth, a  circumstance which caused Hare instantly to associate the savage  clicking with the name he had heard given this man. August Naab looked  at him with gloomy eyes and stern shut mouth, an expression of righteous  anger, helplessness and grief combined, the look of a man to whom  obstacles had been nothing, at last confronted with crowning defeat.  Hare realized that this son was Naab's first-born, best-loved, a thorn  in his side, a black sheep.    \"Say, father, is that the spy you found on the trail?\" Snap's pale eyes  gleamed on Hare and the little flames seemed to darken and leap.    \"This is John Hare, the young man I found. But he's not a spy.\"    \"You can't make any one believe that. He's down as a spy. Dene's spy!  His name's gone over the ranges as a counter of unbranded stock. Dene  has named him and Dene has marked him. Don't take him home, as you've  taken so many sick and hunted men before. What's the good of it? You  never made a Mormon of one of them yet. Don't take him--unless you want  another grave for your cemetery. Ha! Ha!\"    Hare recoiled with a shock. Snap Naab swayed to the door, and stepped  down, all the time with his face over his shoulder, his baleful glance  on Hare; then the blue haze swallowed him.    The several loungers went out; August engaged the storekeeper in  conversation, introducing Hare and explaining their wants. They  inspected the various needs of a range-rider, selecting, in the end, not  the few suggested by Hare, but the many chosen by Naab. The last  purchase was the rifle Naab had talked about. It was a beautiful weapon,  finely polished and carved, entirely out of place among the plain  coarse-sighted and coarse-stocked guns in the rack.    \"Never had a chance to sell it,\" said Abe. \"Too long and heavy for the  riders. I'll let it go cheap, half price, and the cartridges also, two  thousand.\"    \"Taken,\" replied Naab, quickly, with a satisfaction which showed he  liked a bargain.    \"August, you must be going to shoot some?\" queried Abe. \"Something  bigger than rabbits and coyotes. Its about time--even if you are an  Elder. We Mormons must--\" he broke off, continuing in a low tone:  \"Here's Holderness now.\"    Hare wheeled with the interest that had gathered with the reiteration of  this man's name. A new-comer stooped to get in the door. He out-topped  even Naab in height, and was a superb blond-bearded man, striding with  the spring of a mountaineer.    \"Good-day to you, Naab,\" he said. \"Is this the young fellow you picked  up?\"    \"Yes. Jack Hare,\" rejoined Naab.    \"Well, Hare, I'm Holderness. You'll recall my name. You were sent to  Lund by men interested in my ranges. I expected to see you in Lund, but  couldn't get over.\"    Hare met the proffered hand with his own, and as he had recoiled from  Snap Naab so now he received another shock, different indeed but  impelling in its power, instinctive of some great portent. Hare was  impressed by an indefinable subtlety, a nameless distrust, as colorless  as the clear penetrating amber lightness of the eyes that bent upon him.    \"Holderness, will you right the story about Hare?\" inquired Naab.    \"You mean about his being a spy? Well, Naab, the truth is that was his  job. I advised against sending a man down here for that sort of work. It  won't do. These Mormons will steal each other's cattle, and they've got  to get rid of them; so they won't have a man taking account of stock,  brands, and all that. If the Mormons would stand for it the rustlers  wouldn't. I'll take Hare out to the ranch and give him work, if he  wants. But he'd do best to leave Utah.\"    \"Thank you, no,\" replied Hare, decidedly.    \"He's going with me,\" said August Naab.    Holderness accepted this with an almost imperceptible nod, and he swept  Hare with eyes that searched and probed for latent possibilities. It was  the keen intelligence of a man who knew what development meant on the  desert; not in any sense an interest in the young man at present. Then  he turned his back.    Hare, feeling that Holderness wished to talk with Naab, walked to the  counter, and began assorting his purchases, but he could not help  hearing what was said.    \"Lungs bad?\" queried Holderness.    \"One of them,\" replied Naab.    \"He's all in. Better send him out of the country. He's got the name of  Dene's spy and he'll never get another on this desert. Dene will kill  him. This isn't good judgment, Naab, to take him with you. Even your  friends don't like it, and it means trouble for you.\"    \"We've settled it,\" said Naab, coldly.    \"Well, remember, I've warned you. I've tried to be friendly with you,  Naab, but you won't have it. Anyway, I've wanted to see you lately to  find out how we stand.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"How we stand on several things--to begin with, there Mescal.\"    \"You asked me several times for Mescal, and I said no.\"    \"But I never said I'd marry her. Now I want her, and I will marry her.\"    \"No,\" rejoined Naab, adding brevity to his coldness.    \"Why not?\" demanded Holderness. \"Oh, well, I can't take that as an  insult. I know there's not enough money in Utah to get a girl away from  a Mormon.... About the offer for the water-rights--how do we stand? I'll  give you ten thousand dollars for the rights to Seeping Springs and  Silver Cup.\"    \"Ten thousand!\" ejaculated Naab. \"Holderness, I wouldn't take a hundred  thousand. You might as well ask to buy my home, my stock, my range,  twenty years of toil, for ten thousand dollars!\"    \"You refuse? All right. I think I've made you a fair proposition,\" said  Holderness, in a smooth, quick tone. \"The land is owned by the  Government, and though your ranges are across the Arizona line they  really figure as Utah land. My company's spending big money, and the  Government won't let you have a monopoly. No one man can control the  water-supply of a hundred miles of range. Times are changing. You want  to see that. You ought to protect yourself before it's too late.\"    \"Holderness, this is a desert. No men save Mormons could ever have made  it habitable. The Government scarcely knows of its existence. It'll be  fifty years before man can come in here to take our water.\"    \"Why can't he? The water doesn't belong to any one. Why can't he?\"    \"Because of the unwritten law of the desert. No Mormon would refuse you  or your horse a drink, or even a reasonable supply for your stock. But  you can't "]]]
