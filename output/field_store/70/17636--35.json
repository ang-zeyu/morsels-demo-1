This, and the little she has to say  besides, is no riddle to me, because I can see in this dear child the  same character as that of her mother, who was my own dearest friend; who  grew up with myself, and whose daughter, I am certain, if I had the care  of her education, would form into an exquisite creature.    \"This, however, has not fallen in with our plan, and as one ought not to  be picking and pulling, or for ever introducing new elements among the  conditions of our lives, I think it better to bear, and to conquer as I  can, even the unpleasant impression that my daughter, who knows very  well that poor Ottilie is entirely dependent upon us, does not refrain  from flourishing her own successes in her face, and so, to a certain  extent, destroys the little good which we have done for her. Who are  well trained enough never to wound others by a parade of their own  advantages? and who stands so high as not at times to suffer under such  a slight? In trials like these, Ottilie's character is growing in  strength, but since I have clearly known the painfulness of her  situation, I have been thinking over all possible ways to make some  other arrangement. Every hour I am expecting an answer to my own last  letter, and then I do not mean to hesitate any more. So, my dear Edward,  it is with me. We have both, you see, the same sorrows to bear, touching  both our hearts in the same point. Let us bear them together, since we  neither of us can press our own against the other.\"    \"We are strange creatures,\" said Edward, smiling. \"If we can only put  out of sight anything which troubles us, we fancy at once we have got  rid of it. We can give up much in the large and general; but to make  sacrifices in little things is a demand to which we are rarely equal. So  it was with my mother,--as long as I lived with her, while a boy and a  young man, she could not bear to let me be a moment out of her sight. If  I was out later than usual in my ride, some misfortune must have  happened to me. If I got wet through in a shower, a fever was  inevitable. I traveled; I was absent from her altogether; and, at once,  I scarcely seemed to belong to her. If we look at it closer,\" he  continued, \"we are both acting very foolishly, very culpably. Two very  noble natures, both of which have the closest claims on our affection,  we are leaving exposed to pain and distress, merely to avoid exposing  ourselves to a chance of danger. If this is not to be called selfish,  what is? You take Ottilie. Let me have the Captain; and, for a short  period, at least, let the trial be made.\"    \"We might venture it,\" said Charlotte, thoughtfully, \"if the danger were  only to ourselves. But do you think it prudent to bring Ottilie and the  Captain into a situation where they must necessarily be so closely  intimate; the Captain, a man no older than yourself, of an age (I am not  saying this to flatter you) when a man becomes first capable of love and  first deserving of it, and a girl of Ottilie's attractiveness?\"    \"I cannot conceive how you can rate Ottilie so high,\" replied Edward. \"I  can only explain it to myself by supposing her to have inherited your  affection for her mother. Pretty she is, no doubt. I remember the  Captain observing it to me, when we came back last year, and met her at  your aunt's. Attractive she is,--she has particularly pretty eyes; but I  do not know that she made the slightest impression upon me.\"    \"That was quite proper in you,\" said Charlotte, \"seeing that I was  there; and, although she is much younger than I, the presence of your  old friend had so many charms for you, that you overlooked the promise  of the opening beauty. It is one of your ways; and that is one reason  why it is so pleasant to live with you.\"    Charlotte, openly as she appeared to be speaking, was keeping back  something, nevertheless; which was that at the time when Edward came  first back from abroad, she had purposely thrown Ottilie in his way, to  secure, if possible, so desirable a match for her protegee. For of  herself, at that time, in connection with Edward, she never thought at  all. The Captain, also, had a hint given to him to draw Edward's  attention to her; but the latter, who was clinging determinately to his  early affection for Charlotte, looked neither right nor left, and was  only happy in the feeling that it was at last within his power to obtain  for himself the one happiness which he so earnestly desired; and which a  series of incidents had appeared to have placed forever beyond his  reach.    They were on the point of descending the new grounds, in order to return  to the castle, when a servant came hastily to meet them, and, with a  laugh on his face, called up from below, \"Will your grace be pleased to  come quickly to the castle? The Herr Mittler has just galloped into the  court. He shouted to us, to go all of us in search of you, and we were  to ask whether there was need; 'whether there is need,' he cried after  us, 'do you hear? But be quick, be quick.'\"    \"The odd fellow,\" exclaimed Edward. \"But has he not come at the right  time, Charlotte? Tell him, there is need,--grievous need. He must  alight. See his horse taken care of. Take him into the saloon, and let  him have some luncheon. We shall be with him immediately.\"    \"Let us take the nearest way,\" he said to his wife, and struck into the  path across the churchyard, which he usually avoided. He was not a  little surprised to find here, too, traces of Charlotte's delicate hand.  Sparing, as far as possible, the old monuments, she had contrived to  level it, and lay it carefully out, so as to make it appear a pleasant  spot on which the eye and the imagination could equally repose with  pleasure. The oldest stones had each their special honor assigned them.  They were ranged according to their dates along the wall, either leaning  against it, or let into it, or however it could be contrived; and the  string-course of the church was thus variously ornamented.    Edward was singularly affected as he came in upon it through the little  wicket; he pressed Charlotte's hand, and tears started into his eyes.  But these were very soon put to flight, by the appearance of their  singular visitor. This gentleman had declined sitting down in the  castle; he had ridden straight through the village to the churchyard  gate; and then, halting, he called out to his friends, \"Are you not  making a fool of me? Is there need, really? If there is, I can stay till  mid-day. But don't keep me. I have a great deal to do before night.\"    \"Since you have taken the trouble to come so far,\" cried Edward to him,  in answer, \"you had better come through the gate. We meet at a solemn  spot. Come and see the variety which Charlotte has thrown over its  sadness.\"    \"Inside there,\" called out the rider, \"come I neither on horseback, nor  in carriage, nor on foot. These here rest in peace: with them I have  nothing to do. One day I shall be carried in feet foremost. I must bear  that as I can. Is it serious, I want to know?\"    \"Indeed it is,\" cried Charlotte, \"right serious. For the first time in  our married lives, we are in a strait and difficulty, from which we do  not know how to extricate ourselves.\"    \"You do not look as if it were so,\" answered he. \"But I will believe  you. If you are deceiving me, for the future you shall help yourselves.  Follow me quickly, my horse will be none the worse for a rest.\"    The three speedily found themselves in the saloon together. Luncheon was  brought in, and Mittler told them what that day he had done, and was  going to do. This eccentric person had in early life been a clergyman,  and had distinguished himself in his office by the never-resting  activity with which he contrived to make up and put an end to quarrels:  quarrels in families, and quarrels between neighbors; first among the  individuals immediately about him, and afterward among whole  congregations, and among the country gentlemen round. While he was in  the ministry, no married couple was allowed to separate; and the  district courts were untroubled with either cause or process. A  knowledge of the law, he was well aware, was necessary to him. He gave  himself with all his might to the study of it, and very soon felt  himself a match for the best trained advocate. His circle of activity  extended wonderfully, and people were on the point of inducing him to  move to the Residence, where he would find opportunities of exercising  in the higher circles what he had begun in the lowest, when he won a  considerable sum of money in a lottery. With this, he bought himself a  small property. He let the ground to a tenant, and made it the centre of  his operations, with the fixed determination, or rather in accordance  with his old customs and inclinations, never to enter a house when there  was no dispute to make up, and no help to be given. People who were  superstitious about names, and about what they imported, maintained that  it was his being called Mittler which drove him to take upon himself  this strange employment.    Luncheon was laid on the table, and the stranger then solemnly pressed  his host not to wait any longer with the disclosure which he had to  make. Immediately after refreshing himself he would be obliged to leave  them.    Husband and wife made a circumstantial confession; but scarcely had he  caught the substance of the matter, when he started angrily up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#4)"],[1,"of the present Chinese province of Shansi and in the province of  Jehol in Inner Mongolia. These people had been hunters, but then became  pastoral nomads, depending mainly on cattle. The people of this culture  were the tribes later known as Mongols, the so-called proto-Mongols.  Anthropologically they belonged, like the Tunguses, to the Mongol race.    (c) The people of the culture farther west, the _north-west culture_,  were not Mongols. They, too, were originally hunters, and later became a  pastoral people, with a not inconsiderable agriculture (especially  growing wheat and millet). The typical animal of this group soon became  the horse. The horse seems to be the last of the great animals to be  domesticated, and the date of its first occurrence in domesticated form  in the Far East is not yet determined, but we can assume that by 2500  B.C. this group was already in the possession of horses. The horse has  always been a \"luxury\", a valuable animal which needed special care. For  their economic needs, these tribes depended on other animals, probably  sheep, goats, and cattle. The centre of this culture, so far as can be  ascertained from Chinese sources, were the present provinces of Shensi  and Kansu, but mainly only the plains. The people of this culture were  most probably ancestors of the later Turkish peoples. It is not  suggested, of course, that the original home of the Turks lay in the  region of the Chinese provinces of Shensi and Kansu; one gains the  impression, however, that this was a border region of the Turkish  expansion; the Chinese documents concerning that period do not suffice  to establish the centre of the Turkish territory.    (d) In the _west_, in the present provinces of Szechwan and in all the  mountain regions of the provinces of Kansu and Shensi, lived the  ancestors of the Tibetan peoples as another separate culture. They were  shepherds, generally wandering with their flocks of sheep and goats on  the mountain heights.    (e) In the _south_ we meet with four further cultures. One is very  primitive, the Liao culture, the peoples of which are the Austroasiatics  already mentioned. These are peoples who never developed beyond the  stage of primitive hunters, some of whom were not even acquainted with  the bow and arrow. Farther east is the Yao culture, an early  Austronesian culture, the people of which also lived in the mountains,  some as collectors and hunters, some going over to a simple type of  agriculture (denshiring). They mingled later with the last great culture  of the south, the Tai culture, distinguished by agriculture. The people  lived in the valleys and mainly cultivated rice.    The origin of rice is not yet known; according to some scholars, rice  was first cultivated in the area of present Burma and was perhaps at  first a perennial plant. Apart from the typical rice which needs much  water, there were also some strains of dry rice which, however, did not  gain much importance. The centre of this Tai culture may have been in  the present provinces of Kuangtung and Kuanghsi. Today, their  descendants form the principal components of the Tai in Thailand, the  Shan in Burma and the Lao in Laos. Their immigration into the areas of  the Shan States of Burma and into Thailand took place only in quite  recent historical periods, probably not much earlier than A.D. 1000.    Finally there arose from the mixture of the Yao with the Tai culture, at  a rather later time, the Yueeh culture, another early Austronesian  culture, which then spread over wide regions of Indonesia, and of which  the axe of rectangular section, mentioned above, became typical.    Thus, to sum up, we may say that, quite roughly, in the middle of the  third millennium we meet in the _north_ and west of present-day China  with a number of herdsmen cultures. In the _south_ there were a number  of agrarian cultures, of which the Tai was the most powerful, becoming  of most importance to the later China. We must assume that these  cultures were as yet undifferentiated in their social composition, that  is to say that as yet there was no distinct social stratification, but  at most beginnings of class-formation, especially among the nomad  herdsmen.    [Illustration: Map 1. Regions of the principal local cultures in  prehistoric times. _Local cultures of minor importance have not been  shown_.]    6 _The Yang-shao culture_    The various cultures here described gradually penetrated one another,  especially at points where they met. Such a process does not yield a  simple total of the cultural elements involved; any new combination  produces entirely different conditions with corresponding new results  which, in turn, represent the characteristics of the culture that  supervenes. We can no longer follow this process of penetration in  detail; it need not by any means have been always warlike. Conquest of  one group by another was only one way of mutual cultural penetration. In  other cases, a group which occupied the higher altitudes and practiced  hunting or slash-and-burn agriculture came into closer contacts with  another group in the valleys which practiced some form of higher  agriculture; frequently, such contacts resulted in particular forms of  division of labour in a unified and often stratified new form of  society. Recent and present developments in South-East Asia present a  number of examples for such changes. Increase of population is certainly  one of the most important elements which lead to these developments. The  result, as a rule, was a stratified society being made up of at least  one privileged and one ruled stratum. Thus there came into existence  around 2000 B.C. some new cultures, which are well known  archaeologically. The most important of these are the Yang-shao culture  in the west and the Lung-shan culture in the east. Our knowledge of both  these cultures is of quite recent date and there are many enigmas still  to be cleared up.    The _Yang-shao culture_ takes its name from a prehistoric settlement in  the west of the present province of Honan, where Swedish investigators  discovered it. Typical of this culture is its wonderfully fine pottery,  apparently used as gifts to the dead. It is painted in three colours,  white, red, and black. The patterns are all stylized, designs copied  from nature being rare. We are now able to divide this painted pottery  into several sub-types of specific distribution, and we know that this  style existed from _c_. 2200 B.C. on. In general, it tends to disappear  as does painted pottery in other parts of the world with the beginning  of urban civilization and the invention of writing. The typical  Yang-shao culture seems to have come to an end around 1600 or 1500 B.C.  It continued in some more remote areas, especially of Kansu, perhaps to  about 700 B.C. Remnants of this painted pottery have been found over a  wide area from Southern Manchuria, Hopei, Shansi, Honan, Shensi to  Kansu; some pieces have also been discovered in Sinkiang. Thus far, it  seems that it occurred mainly in the mountainous parts of North and  North-West China. The people of this culture lived in villages near to  the rivers and creeks. They had various forms of houses, including  underground dwellings and animal enclosures. They practiced some  agriculture; some authors believe that rice was already known to them.  They also had domesticated animals. Their implements were of stone with  rare specimens of bone. The axes were of the rectangular type. Metal was  as yet unknown, but seems to have been introduced towards the end of the  period. They buried their dead on the higher elevations, and here the  painted pottery was found. For their daily life, they used predominantly  a coarse grey pottery.    After the discovery of this culture, its pottery was compared with the  painted pottery of the West, and a number of resemblances were found,  especially with the pottery of the Lower Danube basin and that of Anau,  in Turkestan. Some authors claim that such resemblances are fortuitous  and believe that the older layers of this culture are to be found in the  eastern part of its distribution and only the later layers in the west.  It is, they say, these later stages which show the strongest  resemblances with the West. Other authors believe that the painted  pottery came from the West where it occurs definitely earlier than in  the Far East; some investigators went so far as to regard the  Indo-Europeans as the parents of that civilization. As we find people  who spoke an Indo-European language in the Far East in a later period,  they tend to connect the spread of painted pottery with the spread of  Indo-European-speaking groups. As most findings of painted pottery in  the Far East do not stem from scientific excavations it is difficult to  make any decision at this moment. We will have to wait for more and  modern excavations.    From our knowledge of primeval settlement in West and North-West China  we know, however, that Tibetan groups, probably mixed with Turkish  elements, must have been the main inhabitants of the whole region in  which this painted pottery existed. Whatever the origin of the painted  pottery may be, it seems that people of these two groups were the main  users of it. Most of the shapes of their pottery are not found in later  Chinese pottery.    7 _The Lung-shan culture_    While the Yang-shao culture flourished in the mountain regions of  northern and western China around 2000 B.C., there came into existence  in the plains of eastern China another culture, which is called the  Lung-shan culture, from the scene of the principal discoveries.  Lung-shan is in the province of Shantung, near Chinan-fu. This culture,  discovered only about twenty-five years ago, is distinguished by a black  pottery of exceptionally fine quality and by a similar absence of metal.  The pottery has a polished appearance on the exterior; it is never  painted,"]]]
