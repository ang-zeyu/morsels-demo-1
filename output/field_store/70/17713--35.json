[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#4)"],[1,"has  escaped the slimy contact.    Sin _could_ not be allowed to stay _there_. Its presence stole heaven away  from heaven. Yet sin had become a part of the man. The man and the wrong  were interwoven. They were inseparable. Sin has such a tenacious, gluey,  sticky touch! Each included the other. _It_ could not be put out without  _his_ being put out. So man had to be driven out for his own sake to rid  his home-spot of sin. The man was driven out that he might come  back--_changed_. Love drove him out that later it might let him in. The  tree of life was kept _from_ him for a time that it might be kept _for_  him for an eternity.    When he had _changed his spirit_, and _changed sides_ in the fight with  evil started that day, and gotten victory over the spirit now dominant  within himself, those gates would swing again. When the stain of his  choice would be taken out of his fibre it would be his right eagerly to  retrace these forced steps, and the coming back would find more than had  been left. Love has been busy planning the home-coming. The tree of life  has been grown in his absence to a grove of trees. The life has become  life more abundant.        <u>Outside the Eden Gate.</u>      The story of what took place outside that guarded gate makes clear the  love, the wise farsighted love that showed the man the way out that day.  To tell the story one must use a pen made of the iron that has entered his  own soul, and though the pen be eased with ball point, it scratches and  sticks in the paper for sheer reluctance. And only the tears of the heart  will do for ink.    That was a costly meal. That first bite must have been a big one. Its  taste is still in the mouth of the race. If that fruit were an apple it  must have been a crab. There has been a bad case of indigestion ever  since. If you think there were no crab-apples in Eden, then the touch of  those thickening lips must have soured it in the eating--man's teeth are  still on edge. The fruit became tough in the chewing. It's not digested  yet. That Garden of Eden must have been on a hill, with lowlands below,  and high hills above, and roads both ways. The man seems to have gotten  into the lowland road, and after a bit, struck some marshes and swamps,  with a good bit of thick gray fog.    The first result of the break with God was _in the man himself_. Man has  two doors opening into himself from God--the eye and the ear. Through  these God comes into the man and makes Himself known. Through these comes  all man knows of God. Both have their hinges in the will, the heart. Man  gave both doors a slam shut that day in Eden. Yet they went shut  _gradually_. That was the God-side of their shutting. He quickly slipped  in an air cushion so the shutting might be softened and delayed, and  meanwhile His presence be appealing to the man.    Refusing to obey God was equal to hearing without being willing to listen.  It was the same thing as looking with that reluctance that won't see, and  then doesn't see. Hearing and seeing lie deeper than ears and eyes, down  in the purpose, the will, the desire of the heart. Unwillingness dulls,  and then deafens the ears. It blurs, and then blinds the eye. An earnest,  loving purpose gives peculiar keenness to the ears, and opens the eye of  the eye. Ears and eyes are very sensitive organs. If their messages be not  faithfully attended to they sulk and pout and refuse to transmit messages.  It is a remarkable fact that habitual inattention to a sound or sight  makes one practically deaf or blind to it; and that close attention  persisted in makes one's ears and eyes almost abnormally keen and quick.  Love's ears and eyes are proverbially acute.    One may be so wholly absorbed in something that he absolutely does not see  the thing on which his eyes are turned. He does not hear the sounds that  are plainly coming to his ear because his thought, back of that his heart,  is elsewhere. Hearing, seeing is with the heart back of ears and eyes. God  is spoken of as silent. Yet His silence may be simply our deafness. The  truth is He is speaking all the time, but we are so absorbed that we do  not hear. He is ever looking into our faces with His great, tender, deep  eyes, but we are so wrapped up in something else that the gaze out of our  eyes is vacant to that Face, and with keenest disappointment, so often  repeated, He gets no answering glance.    Let anybody in doubt about the strict accuracy of this do some  experimenting on himself, either with outer things or regarding God. Let  him obey the inner voice in some particular that may perhaps cut straight  across some fixed habit, and then watch very quietly for the result. It  will come with surprising sureness and quickness. And the reason why is  simple. The man is simply moving back into his native air, and of course  all the powers work better.    This truth about the nerves of the ears and eyes running down into the  heart is constantly being sounded out in the old Book. A famous bit in  Isaiah puts it very clearly, and becomes a sort of pivot passage of all  others of this sort. That fine-grained, intense-spirited young Hebrew was  caught in the temple one day by a sight of God. That wondrous sight held  him with unyielding grip through all the after years. With the sight came  the voice, and the message for the nation: \"Tell these people--you are  continually hearing, but you do not listen, nor take in what you hear.  Your eyes are open, they look, but they do not see.\" Then the voice said,  \"Make their heart _fat_, and their ears _heavy_, and their eyes _shut_.\"    That is to say, by continually telling them what they will continually  refuse to hear because it does not suit the habit of their lives, he would  be setting in motion the action that would bring these results. The ears  that won't hear by and by _can't_ hear. The heart that will not love and  obey gets into a state of fatty degeneration. The valves that refuse to  move in loving obedience will get too heavy with fat to move at all. The  fat clogs the hinges. There is the touch of a soft irony in the _form_ of  the message. As though Isaiah's talking would affect their ears, whereas  it is their refusal to hear that stupefies the hearing organ. In  faithfulness God insists on telling them the truth even though He knows  that their refusal to do will make things worse. But then God is never  held back from good by the possible bad that may work out of it.    When Jesus came, the Jews, to whom His messages to the world were directly  spoken, were in almost the last stages of that sort of thing. So Jesus,  with the fine faithfulness of love blending with the keenest tact, spoke  in language veiled by parable to overcome the intense prejudice against  plainly spoken truth. They were so set against what He had to tell that  the only way to get anything into them at all was so to veil its _form_ as  to befool them into _thinking it truer_. Toward the close, His keenness,  for which they were no match, joining with the growing keenness of their  hate, made them see at once that the sharp edge of some of those last  parables was turned toward themselves.    In explaining to His puzzled disciples about this form of teaching, with  a sad irony that reveals both His heart's yearning and His mental  keenness, He uses more than once with variations this famous bit from  Isaiah. He makes the truth stand out more sharply by stating the opposite  of what He desires, making the contrast between His words and His known  desires so strong as not only to make plain the meaning intended, but to  give it a sharper emphasis.    The result that began with ears and eyes quickly affected the _tongue_.  That is nature's path. The inner road from ear and eye is straight to the  tongue. The tongue is the index of man's whole being. While through ear  and eye he receives all that ever gets in, through the tongue his whole  being is revealed. Of course his personality reveals itself very much  otherwise. In the carriage of the body. Strikingly so in the look of the  eye. The body itself, especially the face, becomes in time the mould of  the spirit within. Yet the tongue--what is said, how it is said, what is  _not_ said, the tone of voice--the tongue is the index of the spirit.    There is no stronger indication of mastery over one's powers than in  control of the tongue. When God would break up man's first great ambitious  scheme of a self-centred monopoly on the Shinar plains, He simply touched  his tongue. The first evidence of God's touch in the re-making of man on  that memorable Pentecost day was upon his tongue.    The effect upon his tongue of the break with God has been radical and  strange. Dumbness, and slowness or thickness of speech alternate with an  unnatural sharpness. Sometimes the spittle has a peculiar oiliness that  results in a certain slipperiness of statement. Sometimes it has a bitter,  poisonous, acid quality that eats its way into the words. There is a queer  backward movement in biting sometimes. Withal a strange looseness of  speech regarding the holiest things, and the most awesome truths, and the  Holy One Himself.    The moment a man gets a vision of God he is instantly conscious of  something the matter with his tongue. The sight that comes to his eyes,  the sound to his ears makes him painfully self-conscious regarding the  defect in his tongue. Moses found himself slow-tongued. Isaiah felt the  need of the cleansing coal for his tongue.    But man's whole inner mental process was affected. A peculiar sense of  fear, of dread, is woven inextricably into the very fibre of man's being.  His first reported word after that break was, \"I was afraid.\" That sense of  fear--a horrid, haunting, nightmare thing--has affected all his thinking  and planning and every-day speech. No phrase is oftener on man's tongue  than \"I'm afraid.\" Isaiah's classic utterance about ears and eyes has a  counterpart "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#4)"],[1," of the pretty girls who was jealous of the bride had told  her that he had three noses, and she was afraid to look at him.    After her people had all returned to their homes, she grew very  unhappy, and when her mother-in-law commanded her to cook she had  to feel her way around, for she would not uncover her face. Finally  she became so sad that she determined to run away. One night when all  were asleep, she used magical power and changed herself into oil. [23]  Then she slid through the bamboo floor and made her escape without  anyone seeing her.    On and on she went until she came to the middle of the jungle, and  then she met a wild rooster who asked her where she was going.    \"I am running away from my husband,\" replied Aponibolinayen, \"for he  has three noses and I do not want to live with him.\"    \"Oh,\" said the rooster, \"some crazy person must have told you that. Do  not believe it. Gawigawen is a handsome man, for I have often seen  him when he comes here to snare chickens.\" [24]    But Aponibolinayen paid no heed to the rooster, and she went on  until she reached a big tree where perched a monkey, and he also  asked where she was going.    \"I am running away from my husband,\" answered the girl, \"for he has  three noses and I do not want to live with him.\"    \"Oh, do not believe that,\" said the monkey. \"Someone who told you  that must have wanted to marry him herself, for he is a handsome man.\"    Still Aponibolinayen went on until she came to the ocean, and then,  as she could go no farther, she sat down to rest. As she sat there  pondering what she should do, a carabao [25] came along, and thinking  that she would ride a while she climbed up on its back. No sooner had  she done so than the animal plunged into the water and swam with her  until they reached the other side of the great ocean.    There they came to a large orange tree, and the carabao told her to  eat some of the luscious fruit while he fed on the grass nearby. As  soon as he had left her, however, he ran straight to his master,  Kadayadawan, and told him of the beautiful girl.    Kadayadawan was very much interested and quickly combed his hair and  oiled it, put on his striped coat [26] and belt, and went with the  carabao to the orange tree. Aponibolinayen, looking down from her  place in the tree, was surprised to see a man coming with her friend,  the carabao, but as they drew near, she began talking with him, and  soon they became acquainted. Before long, Kadayadawan had persuaded  the girl to become his wife, and he took her to his home. From that  time every night his house looked as if it was on fire, because of  the beauty of his bride.    After they had been married for some time, Kadayadawan and  Aponibolinayen decided to make a ceremony [27] for the spirits, so  they called the magic betel-nuts [28] and oiled them and said to them,    \"Go to all the towns and invite our relatives to come to the ceremony  which we shall make. If they do not want to come, then grow on their  knees until they are willing to attend.\"    So the betel-nuts started in different directions and one went to  Aponibalagen in Nalpangan and said,    \"Kadayadawan is making a ceremony for the spirits, and I have come  to summon you to attend.\"    \"We cannot go,\" said Aponibalagen, \"for we are searching for my sister  who is lost\"    \"You must come,\" replied the betel-nut, \"or I shall grow on your knee,\"    \"Grow on my pig,\" answered Aponibalagen; so the betel-nut went on to  the pig's back and grew into a tall tree, and it became so heavy that  the pig could not carry it, but squealed all the time.    Then Aponibalagen, seeing that he must obey, said to the betel-nut,    \"Get off my pig, and we will go.\"    The betel-nut got off the pig's back, and the people started for the  ceremony. When they reached the river, Gawigawen was there waiting to  cross, for the magic nuts had forced him to go also. Then Kadayadawan,  seeing them, sent more betel-nuts to the river, and the people were  carried across by the nuts.    As soon as they reached the town the dancing began, and while Gawigawen  was dancing with Aponibolinayen he seized her and put her in his  belt. [29] Kadayadawan, who saw this, was so angry that he threw his  spear and killed Gawigawen. Then Aponibolinayen escaped and ran into  the house, and her husband brought his victim back to life, and asked  him why he had seized the wife of his host. Gawigawen explained that  she was his wife who had been lost, and the people were very much  surprised, for they had not recognized her at first.    Then all the people discussed what should be done to bring peace  between the two men, and it was finally decided that Kadayadawan must  pay both Aponibalagen and Gawigawen the price that was first demanded  for the beautiful girl.    After this was done all were happy; and the guardian spirit of  Kadayadawan gave them a golden house in which to live.        Gawigawen of Adasen    _Tinguian_      Aponibolinayen was sick with a headache, and she lay on a mat alone  in her house. Suddenly she remembered some fruit that she had heard  of but had never seen, and she said to herself, \"Oh, I wish I had  some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen.\"    Now Aponibolinayen did not realize that she had spoken aloud, but  Aponitolau, her husband, lying in the spirit house [30] outside,  heard her talking and asked what it was she said. Fearing to tell him  the truth lest he should risk his life in trying to get the oranges  for her, she said: \"I wish I had some biw\" (a fruit).    Aponitolau at once got up, and, taking a sack, went out to find some of  the fruit for his wife. When he returned with the sack full, she said:    \"Put it on the bamboo hanger above the fire, and when my head is  better I will eat it.\"    So Aponitolau put the fruit on the hanger and returned to the spirit  house, but when Aponibolinayen tried to eat, the fruit made her sick  and she threw it away.    \"What is the matter?\" called Aponitolau as he heard her drop the fruit.    \"I merely dropped one,\" she replied, and returned to her mat.    After a while Aponibolinayen again said:    \"Oh, I wish I had some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" and  Aponitolau, who heard her from the spirit house, inquired:    \"What is that you say?\"    \"I wish I had some fish eggs,\" answered his wife; for she did not  want him to know the truth.    Then Aponitolau took his net and went to the river, determined to  please his wife if possible. When he had caught a nice fish he opened  it with his knife and took out the eggs. Then he spat on the place  he had cut, and it was healed and the fish swam away. [31]    Pleased that he was able to gratify his wife's wishes, he hastened home  with the eggs; and while his wife was roasting them over the fire, he  returned to the spirit house. She tried to eat, but the eggs did not  taste good to her, and she threw them down under the house to the dogs.    \"What is the matter?\" called Aponitolau. \"Why are the dogs barking?\"    \"I dropped some of the eggs,\" replied his wife, and she went back to  her mat.    By and by she again said:    \"I wish I had some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen.\"    But when her husband asked what she wished, she replied:    \"I want a deer's liver to eat\"    So Aponitolau took his dogs to the mountains, where they hunted until  they caught a deer, and when he had cut out its liver he spat on the  wound, and it was healed so that the deer ran away.    But Aponibolinayen could not eat the liver any more than she could the  fruit or the fish eggs; and when Aponitolau heard the dogs barking, he  knew that she had thrown it away. Then he grew suspicious and, changing  himself into a centipede, [32] hid in a crack in the floor. And when  his wife again wished for some of the oranges, he overheard her.    \"Why did you not tell me the truth, Aponibolinayen?\" he asked.    \"Because,\" she replied, \"no one Who has gone to Adasen has ever come  back, and I did not want you to risk your life.\"    Nevertheless Aponitolau determined to go for the oranges, and he  commanded his wife to bring him rice straw. After he had burned it he  put the ashes in the water with which he washed his hair. [33] Then  she brought cocoanut oil and rubbed his hair, and fetched a dark clout,  a fancy belt, and a head-band, and she baked cakes for him to take on  the journey. Aponitolau cut a vine [34] which he planted by the stove,  [35] and told his wife that if the leaves wilted she would know that  he was dead. Then he took his spear and head-ax [36] and started on  the long journey.    When Aponitolau arrived at the well of a giantess, all the betel-nut  trees bowed. Then the giantess shouted and all the world trembled. \"How  strange,\" thought Aponitolau, \"that all the world shakes when that  woman shouts.\" But he continued on his way without stopping.    As he passed the place of the old woman, Alokotan, she sent out her  little dog and it bit his leg.    \"Do not proceed,\" said the old woman, \"for ill luck awaits you. If  you go on, you will never return to your home.\"    But Aponitolau paid no attention to the old woman, and by and by he  came to the home of the lightning.    \"Where are you going?\" asked the lightning.    \"I am going to get some oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" replied  Aponitolau.    \"Go stand on that high rock that I may see what your sign is,\"  commanded the lightning.    So he stood on the high rock, but when the lightning flashed Aponitolau  dodged.    \"Do not go,\" said the lightning, \"for you have a bad sign, and you  will never come back.\"    Still Aponitolau did not heed.    Soon he arrived at the place of Silit (loud thunder), [37] who also  asked him:    \"Where are you going, Aponitolau?\"    \"I am going to get oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" he replied.    Then the thunder commanded:    \"Stand on that high stone so that I can see if you have a good sign.\"    He stood on the high stone, and"]]]
