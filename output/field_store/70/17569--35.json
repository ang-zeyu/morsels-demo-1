FINLEY, JR.      The extensive collection of Mexican mammals made by Mr. J. R.  Alcorn for the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History  contains fourteen pinon mice from lava rocks eight miles northeast  of the city of Durango, Mexico. These mice are all much darker  than the pinon mice, _Peromyscus truei gentilis_, of adjoining areas  in Durango and Zacatecas and show a superficial resemblance to  the widespread _P. t. gratus_ which occurs 450 miles to the southeast.  Morphological differences from _P. t. gratus_, as well as geographic  considerations (see remarks), make desirable the recognition of the  lava-dwelling pinon mice from Durango as a distinct subspecies.    All specimens examined of subspecies compared with the series  of pinon mice from northeast of Durango are in the University of  Kansas Museum of Natural History. Capitalized color names and  designators are of Maerz and Paul, A Dictionary of Color, McGraw  Hill Book Co., New York, 1930.    I wish to acknowledge generous financial aid from the Kansas  University Endowment Association which made possible the field  work by Mr. Alcorn in Mexico.    This heretofore unknown subspecies is characterized below and  may be known as:    =Peromyscus truei erasmus= subsp. nov.    _Type._--Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas, no. 34417, young adult female, skin  and skull; from eight miles northeast of Durango, 6200 feet, Durango,  Mexico; collected 16 August 1949 by J. R. Alcorn, original number 10255.    _Range._--Known only from the type locality.    _Diagnosis._--Upper parts dark brownish gray (Smoke Brown, 16 A 2, to  Biskra, 16 A 12), darkest between ears; lower sides suffused with dull  orange buff (13 H 9 to 12 H 9); dark eye ring and black spot at base of  vibrissae conspicuous; ears 95 to 100 per cent as long as hind foot; bullae  round, greatly inflated; interparietal large, anterior margin curved or  slightly sinuous, not bulging strongly forward laterally; rostrum short;  nasals broad; braincase high and full; incisive foramina slightly pointed  anteriorly; molars small, as in _P. t. gentilis_.    _Measurements._--Measurements of 3 males and mean and extreme measurements  of 11 females, all from the type locality, are, respectively, as follows:  total length, 192, 188 (incomplete), 196 (incomplete), 193 (188-209);  length of tail, 102, 97 (broken), 97 (broken), 101 (94-114); length of hind  foot, 22, 23, 23, 22.5 (22-23); length of ear, from notch, in flesh, 21,  22, 23, 21.5 (20-23); greatest length of skull, 27.4, 27.7, 27.9, 27.3  (26.5-28.3); basilar length, 20.2, 21.0, -- (broken), 20.4 (19.6-21.2);  greatest breadth of braincase, 12.8, 12.8, 13.3, 12.85 (12.4-13.4); least  interorbital breadth, 4.4, 4.6, 4.6, 4.41 (4.2-4.6); length of nasals,  10.1, 10.3, 10.9, 10.3 (9.8-11.1); diastema, 6.6, 7.0, 7.1, 6.78 (6.3-7.2);  length of incisive foramina, 5.6, 5.9, 6.0, 5.77 (5.5-6.0); length of  palatal bridge, 3.8, 3.9, --, 3.96 (3.8-4.3); postpalatal length, 9.9, --,  --, 9.7 (9.2-10.4); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.1, 4.1, 4.4,  4.2 (4.1-4.4). All measurements are in millimeters.    _Measurements of the type._--Total length, 189; length of tail, 95; length  of hind foot, 22; length of ear, from notch (in flesh), 21; greatest length  of skull, 26.9; basilar length, 20.3; greatest breadth of braincase, 13.0;  least interorbital breadth, 4.4; length of nasals, 10.1; diastema, 6.6;  length of incisive foramina, 5.5; length of palatal bridge, 3.9;  postpalatal length, 9.8; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.2.    _Comparisons._--From _Peromyscus truei gentilis_ (specimens from 5 mi. N  Durango, Durango; 4 mi. W Durango, Durango; and 8 mi. N & 1 mi. W  Sombrerete, Zacatecas), the subspecies of the surrounding region, _P. t.  erasmus_ differs in markedly darker coloration, sides and face less  brightly washed with orange buff, dark eye ring and spot at base of  vibrissae more conspicuous, higher incidence and greater extent of buffy  pectoral spot. External measurements do not differ significantly. No  consistent cranial differences were found.    From _Peromyscus truei gratus_ (specimens from Pedregal de los Reyes,  Distrito Federal, Mexico) to the southeast, _P. t. erasmus_ differs in  slightly darker dorsal color, more inflated bullae, and less sinuous (not  bulging so much forward laterally) anterior margin of interparietal.    From _Peromyscus truei gratus_ (specimens from various localities in  eastern Jalisco and western Michoacan) to the south, _P. t. erasmus_  differs in slightly darker dorsal color, longer ears, and more inflated  bullae.    From _Peromyscus truei truei_ (specimens from 4 mi. N El Rito, Rio Arriba  Co., New Mexico) to the northwest, _P. t. erasmus_ differs in much darker  color, shorter tail, shorter hairs on tail, smaller ears, shorter rostrum,  wider nasals, and more pointed anterior ends of incisive foramina.    _Remarks._--The tail of _P. t. erasmus_ varies greatly in color, being  either bicolor or unicolor, dark gray above and varying from white  to dark gray below. The type has the tail dark gray above grading  gradually on the sides to medium gray below. A buffy pectoral  spot or band is present in about half of the adults examined, being  most prominent in the type, which is also one of the darkest specimens  in the series. The shape of the posterior edge of the bony  palate is also variable, being convex, square, or concave; and the  dorsal branches of the premaxillaries may terminate slightly anterior  or slightly posterior to the posterior ends of the nasals. In the type  the posterior palatal margin is concave and the dorsal branches of  the premaxillaries almost reach the ends of the nasals. _Peromyscus  truei gratus_ from Distrito Federal also shows high variability in all  these characters.    _Peromyscus truei erasmus_ is a dark race of the pinon mouse known  from the west side of a rough area of dark lavas a few miles northeast  of the city of Durango and closely surrounded by the light colored  race, _P. t. gentilis_, known from outside the area of lava rocks.  Specimens of _erasmus_ from eight miles northeast of Durango are  all conspicuously darker than 11 specimens of _gentilis_ from five  miles north of Durango and four miles west of Durango which are  typical in color for _gentilis_. Although _erasmus_ more nearly resembles  in color _gratus_, in cranial characters and external measurements  it shows closer relationship to _gentilis_.    Alcorn reported (verbal communication) that the type series of  _erasmus_ was collected on the west side of the Rio de la Saucida in  hills covered with broken lava rocks, cactus, and spiny shrubs.  Some cottonwoods grow along the river, which is almost dry most  of the time. East of the river is a flat plain or valley of adobelike  soil a few miles wide beyond which extends a rough area of dark  lavas. The approximate extent of the lava plain is indicated on  World Aeronautical Chart, Lake Santiaguillo (521). The specimens  of _gentilis_ from five miles north of Durango and four miles west of  Durango were collected on slopes of adobe soil covered with grasses,  scattered junipers and low shrubs, this habitat being the lower eastern  edge of the juniper-wooded slopes that rise westward to the  Sierra Madre Occidental.    The available facts suggest that _P. t. erasmus_ has evolved from  _P. t. gentilis_ by natural selection for concealing coloration on the  dark lavas northeast of Durango, Mexico. _P. t. erasmus_ probably  reaches its western limit close to the type locality.    _Specimens examined._--Total 14, from the type locality.    _Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, Lawrence._    _Transmitted January 21, 1952._    24-2794"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31516"],[0,"The Eyes Have It"],[1,"This etext was produced from _Science Fiction Stories_ 1953.

Theoretically, you could find this type of humor anywhere. But      only a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have      written this story, in just this way...._          _The Eyes Have It_    by PHILIP K. DICK      It was quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of  Earth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven't done  anything about it; I can't think of anything to do. I wrote to the  Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and  maintenance of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I'm not  the first to discover it. Maybe it's even under control.    I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a  paperbacked book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the  reference that first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn't  respond. It took some time for the full import to sink in. After I'd  comprehended, it seemed odd I hadn't noticed it right away.    The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible  properties, not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out,  customarily masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise,  however, became transparent in the face of the following observations  by the author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew  everything--and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble  remembering it even now) read:        _... his eyes slowly roved about the room._    Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll  like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through the  air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the  story was surprised. That's what tipped me off. No sign of amazement  at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.        _... his eyes moved from person to person._    There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from the  rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath  choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention of a  totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the  characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they  belonged to the same species.    And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author was  taking it rather _too easily_ in his stride. Evidently, he felt this  was quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this  knowledge. The story continued:        _... presently his eyes fastened on Julia._    Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She  is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I  sighed with relief. They weren't _all_ non-Terrestrials. The narrative  continues:        _... slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her._    Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter  ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family  regarded me in wonder.    \"What's wrong, dear?\" my wife asked.    I couldn't tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary  run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. \"Nothing,\" I  gasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.           *       *       *       *       *    In the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read  the next revealing passage:        _... he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if      he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile._    It's not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed  it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it was  thrown away. I don't care. In any case, the full meaning was there,  staring me right in the face.    Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their  anatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an  eyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point.  Obviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of  primitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than  starfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know.    I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly  by the author without the faintest tremor:        _... outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went      inside, part over to the cafe for dinner._    Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.  Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the  upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really  stumbled onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this  passage:        _... I'm afraid there's no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has      lost his head again._    Which was followed by:        _... and Bob says he has utterly no guts._    Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,  however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:        _... totally lacking in brains._           *       *       *       *       *    There was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had  thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an  alien life form, similar to the rest:        _... quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the      young man._    It didn't relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I  didn't really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in  her usual manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart,  arms, eyes, brains, viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion  demanded. Without a qualm.        _... thereupon she gave him her hand._    I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I  shudder to think what he's done with them, by this time.        _... he took her arm._    Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own.  Flushing crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But  not in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of  anatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:        _... her eyes followed him all the way down the road and      across the meadow._    I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the  accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing  Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,  brow feverish, teeth chattering.    I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let  them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don't want to get mixed up in  it.    I have absolutely no stomach for it."]]]
