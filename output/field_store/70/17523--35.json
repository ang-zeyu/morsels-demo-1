They  promised to come today; I'm afraid something has happened to prevent  them.\" And Octavia gladly seized upon the new subject. But my lady was  not to be eluded.    \"They said they could not come till after dinner. They will soon arrive.  Before they do so, I must say a few words, Tavia, and I beg you to give  heed to them. I desire you to be courteous and amiable to Mr. Annon, and  before strangers to be less attentive and affectionate to Maurice. You  mean it kindly, but it looks ill, and causes disagreeable remarks.\"    \"Who blames me for being devoted to my cousin? Can I ever do enough to  repay him for his devotion? Mamma, you forget he saved your son's life.\"    Indignant tears filled the girl's eyes, and she spoke passionately,  forgetting that Mrs. Snowdon was within earshot of her raised voice.  With a frown my lady laid her hand on her daughter's lips, saying  coldly, \"I do not forget, and I religiously discharge my every  obligation by every care and comfort it is in my power to bestow. You  are young, romantic, and tender-hearted. You think you must give your  time and health, must sacrifice your future happiness to this duty. You  are wrong, and unless you learn wisdom in season, you will find that you  have done harm, not good.\"    \"God forbid! How can I do that? Tell me, and I will be wise in time.\"    Turning the earnest face up to her own, Lady Treherne whispered  anxiously, \"Has Maurice ever looked or hinted anything of love during  this year he has been with us, and you his constant companion?\"    \"Never, Mamma; he is too honorable and too unhappy to speak or think of  that. I am his little nurse, sister, and friend, no more, nor ever shall  be. Do not suspect us, or put such fears into my mind, else all our  comfort will be spoiled.\"    Flushed and eager was the girl, but her clear eyes betrayed no tender  confusion as she spoke, and all her thought seemed to be to clear her  cousin from the charge of loving her too well. Lady Treherne looked  relieved, paused a moment, then said, seriously but gently, \"This is  well, but, child, I charge you tell me at once, if ever he forgets  himself, for this thing cannot be. Once I hoped it might, now it is  impossible; remember that he continue a friend and cousin, nothing more.  I warn you in time, but if you neglect the warning, Maurice must go. No  more of this; recollect my wish regarding Mr. Annon, and let your cousin  amuse himself without you in public.\"    \"Mamma, do you wish me to like Frank Annon?\"    The abrupt question rather disturbed my lady, but knowing her daughter's  frank, impetuous nature, she felt somewhat relieved by this candor, and  answered decidedly, \"I do. He is your equal in all respects; he loves  you, Jasper desires it, I approve, and you, being heart-whole, can have  no just objection to the alliance.\"    \"Has he spoken to you?\"    \"No, to your brother.\"    \"You wish this much, Mamma?\"    \"Very much, my child.\"    \"I will try to please you, then.\" And stifling a sigh, the girl kissed  her mother with unwonted meekness in tone and manner.    \"Now I am well pleased. Be happy, my love. No one will urge or distress  you. Let matters take their course, and if this hope of ours can be  fulfilled, I shall be relieved of the chief care of my life.\"    A sound of girlish voices here broke on their ears, and springing up,  Octavia hurried to meet her friends, exclaiming joyfully, \"They have  come! they have come!\"    Two smiling, blooming girls met her at the door, and, being at an  enthusiastic age, they gushed in girlish fashion for several minutes,  making a pretty group as they stood in each other's arms, all talking at  once, with frequent kisses and little bursts of laughter, as vents for  their emotion. Madame Mere welcomed them and then went to join Mrs.  Snowdon, leaving the trio to gossip unrestrained.    \"My dearest creature, I thought we never should get here, for Papa had a  tiresome dinner party, and we were obliged to stay, you know,\" cried  Rose, the lively sister, shaking out the pretty dress and glancing at  herself in the mirror as she fluttered about the room like a butterfly.    \"We were dying to come, and so charmed when you asked us, for we haven't  seen you this age, darling,\" added Blanche, the pensive one, smoothing  her blond curls after a fresh embrace.    \"I'm sorry the Ulsters couldn't come to keep Christmas with us, for we  have no gentlemen but Jasper, Frank Annon, and the major. Sad, isn't  it?\" said Octavia, with a look of despair, which caused a fresh peal  of laughter.    \"One apiece, my dear, it might be worse.\" And Rose privately decided to  appropriate Sir Jasper.    \"Where is your cousin?\" asked Blanche, with a sigh of sentimental  interest.    \"He is here, of course. I forget him, but he is not on the flirting  list, you know. We must amuse him, and not expect him to amuse us,  though really, all the capital suggestions and plans for merrymaking  always come from him.\"    \"He is better, I hope?\" asked both sisters with real sympathy, making  their young faces womanly and sweet.    \"Yes, and has hopes of entire recovery. At least, they tell him so,  though Dr. Ashley said there was no chance of it.\"    \"Dear, dear, how sad! Shall we see him, Tavia?\"    \"Certainly; he is able to be with us now in the evening, and enjoys  society as much as ever. But please take no notice of his infirmity, and  make no inquiries beyond the usual 'How do you do.' He is sensitive, and  hates to be considered an invalid more than ever.\"    \"How charming it must be to take care of him, he is so accomplished and  delightful. I quite envy you,\" said Blanche pensively.    \"Sir Jasper told us that the General and Mrs. Snowdon were coming. I  hope they will, for I've a most intense curiosity to see her--\"  began Rose.    \"Hush, she is here with Mamma! Why curious? What is the mystery? For you  look as if there was one,\" questioned Octavia under her breath.    The three charming heads bent toward one another as Rose replied in a  whisper, \"If I knew, I shouldn't be inquisitive. There was a rumor that  she married the old general in a fit of pique, and now repents. I asked  Mamma once, but she said such matters were not for young girls to hear,  and not a word more would she say. _N'importe_, I have wits of my  own, and I can satisfy myself. The gentlemen are coming! Am I all right,  dear?\" And the three glanced at one another with a swift scrutiny that  nothing could escape, then grouped themselves prettily, and waited, with  a little flutter of expectation in each young heart.    In came the gentlemen, and instantly a new atmosphere seemed to pervade  the drawing room, for with the first words uttered, several romances  began. Sir Jasper was taken possession of by Rose, Blanche intended to  devote herself to Maurice Treherne, but Annon intercepted her, and  Octavia was spared any effort at politeness by this unexpected move on  the part of her lover.    \"He is angry, and wishes to pique me by devoting himself to Blanche. I  wish he would, with all my heart, and leave me in peace. Poor Maurice,  he expects me, and I long to go to him, but must obey Mamma.\" And  Octavia went to join the group formed by my lady, Mrs. Snowdon, the  general, and the major.    The two young couples flirted in different parts of the room, and  Treherne sat alone, watching them all with eyes that pierced below the  surface, reading the hidden wishes, hopes, and fears that ruled them. A  singular expression sat on his face as he turned from Octavia's clear  countenance to Mrs. Snowdon's gloomy one. He leaned his head upon his  hand and fell into deep thought, for he was passing through one of those  fateful moments which come to us all, and which may make or mar a life.  Such moments come when least looked for: an unexpected meeting, a  peculiar mood, some trivial circumstance, or careless word produces it,  and often it is gone before we realize its presence, leaving  aftereffects to show us what we have gained or lost. Treherne was  conscious that the present hour, and the acts that filled it, possessed  unusual interest, and would exert an unusual influence on his life.  Before him was the good and evil genius of his nature in the guise of  those two women. Edith Snowdon had already tried her power, and accident  only had saved him. Octavia, all unconscious as she was, never failed to  rouse and stimulate the noblest attributes of mind and heart. A year  spent in her society had done much for him, and he loved her with a  strange mingling of passion, reverence, and gratitude. He knew why Edith  Snowdon came, he felt that the old fascination had not lost its charm,  and though fear was unknown to him, he was ill pleased at the sight of  the beautiful, dangerous woman. On the other hand, he saw that Lady  Treherne desired her daughter to shun him and smile on Annon; he  acknowledged that he had no right to win the young creature, crippled  and poor as he was, and a pang of jealous pain wrung his heart as he  watched her.    Then a sense of power came to him, for helpless, poor, and seemingly an  object of pity, he yet felt that he held the honor, peace, and happiness  of nearly every person present in his hands. It was a strong temptation  to this man, so full of repressed passion and power, so set apart and  shut out from the more stirring duties and pleasures of life. A few  words from his lips, and the pity all felt for him would be turned to  fear, respect, and admiration. Why not utter them, and enjoy all that  was possible? He owed the Trehernes nothing; why suffer injustice,  dependence, and the compassion that wounds a proud man deepest? Wealth,  love, pleasure might be his with a breath. Why not secure them now?    His pale face flushed, his eye kindled, and his thin hand lay clenched  like a vise as these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind. A look, a  word at that moment would sway him; he felt "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1,"that  range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries  and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References  to other situations may also be included that are border or frontier relevant,  such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.  However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or  recognition by the US Government.    Irrigated land: The figure refers to the number of km 2 that is artifically  supplied with water.    Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land  cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);  permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each  harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently used  for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland land--under dense or open  stands of trees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above  (urban areas, roads, desert).    Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents  the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved with the day-  to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the  administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.  In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head  of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head  of government.    Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of  people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in  the future.    Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless  otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability  to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual  countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of  this publication.    Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version of The World  Factbook for the foreseeable future.    Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national  claims from being extended the full distance.    Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial  vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing  vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by  nationality or register.    Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or  colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent  country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an  internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the  parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime  laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a  captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.  The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it  is not the register of an independent state.    Flag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a  merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)  attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent  taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are  characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in  the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the  merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.    Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal  jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences  in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and  whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.    Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national  register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that  nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on  the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of  profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship  Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of  an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the  national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to  the Norwegian and Danish flags.    Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly  used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial  vessels only.    Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the  maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual  ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and  makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)  regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise  indicated.    National product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given  year. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and  GNP/GDP methodology.    Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and  leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear  population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net  immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).    Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample  surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.    Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per  woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore  children according to a given fertility rate at each age.    Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY).    ***    THE WORLD FACTBOOK 1993    *Afghanistan, Geography    Location:    South Asia, between Iran and Pakistan  Map references:    Asia, Middle East, Standard Time Zones of the World  Area:   total area:    647,500 km2   land area:    647,500 km2   comparative area:    slightly smaller than Texas  Land boundaries:    total 5,529 km, China 76 km, Iran 936 km, Pakistan 2,430 km, Tajikistan    1,206 km, Turkmenistan 744 km, Uzbekistan 137 km  Coastline:    0 km (landlocked)  Maritime claims:    none; landlocked  International disputes:    periodic disputes with Iran over Helmand water rights; Iran supports clients    in country, private Pakistani and Saudi sources may also be active; power    struggles among various groups for control of Kabul, regional rivalries    among emerging warlords, traditional tribal disputes continue; support to    Islamic fighters in Tajikistan's civil war; border dispute with Pakistan    (Durand Line)  Climate:    arid to semiarid; cold winters and hot summers  Terrain:    mostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest  Natural resources:    natural gas, petroleum, coal, copper, talc, barites, sulphur, lead, zinc,    iron ore, salt, precious and semiprecious stones  Land use:   arable land:    12%   permanent crops:    0%   meadows and pastures:    46%   forest and woodland:    3%   other:    39%  Irrigated land:    26,600 km2 (1989 est.)
