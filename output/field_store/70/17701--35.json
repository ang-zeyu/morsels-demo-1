It was a dismal afternoon, and the witness-box at the Old Bailey is so  situated that evidence is given with the back to the light; thus, though  her heavy veil was raised at last, and it could be seen that she was  very pale, it was not yet that Rachel Minchin afforded a chance to the  lightning artists of the half-penny press, or even to the students of  physiognomy behind the man with the white hair. This listener did not  lean forward an inch; the questions were answered in so clear a voice as  to render it unnecessary. Yet it was one of these questions, put by her  own counsel, which caused the white-headed man to clap a sudden hand to  his ear, and to incline that ear as though the answer could not come  without some momentary hesitation or some change of tone. Rachel had  told sadly but firmly of her final quarrel with her husband,  incidentally, but without embarrassment, revealing its cause. A neighbor  was dangerously ill, whom she had been going to nurse that night, when  her husband met her at the door and forbade her to do so.    \"Was this neighbor a young man?\"    \"Hardly more than a boy,\" said Rachel, \"and as friendless as ourselves.\"    \"Was your husband jealous of him?\"    \"I had no idea of it until that night.\"    \"Did you find it out then?\"    \"I did, indeed!\"    \"And where had your husband been spending the evening?\"    \"I had no idea of that either--until he told me he had been watching the  house--and why!\"    Though the man was dead, she could not rid her voice of its scorn; and  presently, with bowed head, she was repeating his last words to her. A  cold thrill ran through the court.    \"And was that the last time you saw him alive?\" inquired counsel, his  face lightening in ready apprehension of the thrill, and his assurance  coming back to him on the spot, as though it were he who had insisted  on putting his client in the box.    But to this there was no immediate answer; for it was here that the  white-haired man raised his hand to his ear; and the event was exactly  as he seemed to have anticipated.    \"Was that the last time you saw your husband alive?\" repeated Rachel's  counsel, in the winning accents and with the reassuring face that he  could assume without an effort at his will.    \"It was,\" said Rachel, after yet another moment's thought.    It was then that the white-headed man dropped his eyes for once; and for  once the thin, hard lines of his mouth relaxed in a smile that seemed to  epitomize all the evil that was in his face, and to give it forth in one  sudden sour quintessence.          CHAPTER III    NAME AND NATURE      The prisoner's evidence concluded with a perfectly simple if somewhat  hesitating account of her own doings during the remainder of the night  of her husband's murder. That story has already been told in greater  detail than could be extracted even by the urbane but deadly  cross-examiner who led for the Crown. A change had come over the manner  in which Rachel was giving her evidence; it was as though her strength  and nerve were failing her together, and henceforth the words had to be  put into her mouth. Curiously enough, the change in Mrs. Minchin's  demeanor was almost coincident with the single and rather sinister  display of feeling upon the part of the white-haired gentleman who had  followed every word of the case. On the whole, however, her story bore  the stamp of truth; and a half-apologetic but none the less persistent  cross-examination left it scarcely less convincing than before.    There was one independent witness for the defence, in addition to the  experts in photography and chains. The landlady of the house at which  Rachel called, in the early morning, on her way home with the cab, was  about five minutes in the witness-box, but in those five minutes she  supplied the defence with one of its strongest arguments. It was at  least conceivable that a woman who had killed her husband might coolly  proceed to pack her trunk, and thereafter fetch the cab which was to  remove herself and her effects from the scene of the tragedy. But was it  credible that a woman of so much presence of mind, to whom every minute  might make the difference between life and death, would, having found  her cab, actually drive out of her way to inquire after a sick friend,  or even a dying lover, before going home to pick up her luggage and to  ascertain whether her crime was still undetected? Suppose it were a  lover, and inquire one must: would one not still leave those inquiries  to the last? And having made them, last or first; and knowing the grim  necessity of flight; would one woman go out of her way to tell another  that she \"had to go abroad very suddenly, and was going for good?\"    \"Inconceivable!\" cried the prisoner's counsel, dealing with the point;  and the word was much upon his lips during the course of a long and very  strenuous speech, in which the case for the Crown was flouted from  beginning to end, without, perhaps, enough of concentration on its more  obvious weaknesses, or of respect for its undoubted strength. For the  prisoner's proceedings on the night of the murder, however, supposing  she had committed it, and still more on the morning after, it would have  been difficult to find a better epithet; the only drawback was that this  one had seen service in the cause of almost every murderer who ever went  to the gallows--as counsel for the prosecution remarked in his reply,  with deadly deference to his learned friend.    \"On the other hand,\" he went on, wagging his eyeglasses with leisurely  deliberation, and picking his words with a care that enhanced their  effect, after the unbridled rhetoric of the defence--\"on the other hand,  gentlemen, if criminals never made mistakes, inconceivable or not as we  may choose to consider them--if they never made those mistakes, they  would never stand in that dock.\"    It was late on the Saturday afternoon when the judge summed up; but a  pleasant surprise was in store for those who felt that his lordship must  speak at greater length than either of the counsel between whom he was  to hold the scales. The address from the bench was much the shortest of  the three. Less exhaustive than the conventional review of a  complicated case, it was a disquisition of conspicuous clearness and  impartiality. Only the salient points were laid before the jury, for the  last time, and in a nutshell, but with hardly a hint of the judge's own  opinion upon any one of them. The expression of that opinion was  reserved for a point of even greater import than the value of any  separate piece of evidence. If, said the judge, the inferences and  theory of the prosecution were correct; if this unhappy woman, driven to  desperation by her husband, and knowing where he kept his pistols, had  taken his life with one of them, and afterwards manufactured the traces  of a supposititious burglary; then there was no circumstance connected  with the crime which could by any possibility reduce it from murder to  manslaughter. The solemnity of this pronouncement was felt in the  farthest corner of the crowded court. So they were to find her guilty of  wilful murder, or not guilty at all! Every eye sped involuntarily to the  slim black figure in the dock; and, under the gaze of all, the figure  made the least little bow--a movement so slight and so spontaneous as to  suggest unconsciousness, but all the more eloquent on that account.    Yet to many in court, more especially to the theatrical folk behind the  man with the white hair, the gesture was but one more subtle touch in  an exhibition of consummate art and nerve.    \"If they do acquit her,\" whispered one of these wiseacres to another,  \"she will make her fortune on the stage!\"    Meanwhile the judge was dealing at the last with the prisoner's evidence  in her own behalf, and that mercifully enough, though with less  reticence than had characterized the earlier portions of his address. He  did not think it possible or even desirable to forget that this was the  evidence of a woman upon trial for her life. It must not be discredited  on that account. But it was for the jury to bear in mind that the story  was one which admitted of no corroboration, save in unimportant details.  More than that he would not say. It was for them to judge of that story  as they had heard it for themselves, on its own merits, but also in  relation to the other evidence. If the jury believed it, there was an  end of the case. If they had any reasonable doubt at all, the prisoner  was entitled to the full benefit of that doubt, and they must acquit  her. If, on the other hand, the facts taken together before and after  the murder brought the jury to the conclusion that it was none other  than the prisoner who had committed the murder--though, of course, no  one was present to see the act committed--they must, in duty to their  oaths, find her guilty.    During the judge's address the short November day had turned from  afternoon to night, and a great change had come over the aspect of the  dim and dingy court. Opaque globes turned into flaring suns;  incandescent burners revealed unsuspected brackets; the place was warmed  and lighted for the first time during the week. And the effect of the  light and warmth was on all the faces that rose as one while the judge  sidled from the bench, and the jury filed out of their box, and the  prisoner disappeared down the dock stairs for the last time in ignorance  of her fate. Next moment there was the buzz of talk that you expect in a  theatre between the acts, rather than in a court of justice at the  solemn crisis of a solemn trial. It was like a class-room with the  master called away. Hats were put on again in the bulging"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12595"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Some of the singers--the serious  order of singers--are as namby-pamby off the stage as they are on it,  unless revelling in \"sweet sounds;\" they are too fond of humming tunes,  solfaing, and rehearsing graces in society; they have plenty to sing,  but nothing to say for themselves; they chime the quarters like \"our  grandmother's clock,\" and at every revolution of the minute index,  strike up their favourite tune.

He has no affection for the  schemes, or \"vain imaginations\" of other men--no one can ridicule  them more smartly--he loves only \"flowers of his own gathering\"--he  places them in his breast, and wears them there with miraculous  constancy--flaunts them in the eyes of his friends--woos the applause,  the admiration of every one at their charms--and the instant he  discovers that another feels a budding fondness for their beauties,  he dashes them from him, and abuses them for ever after, _sans_  mercy.--_Every Night Book_.           *       *       *       *       *          FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE WORKS OF CANOVA.    (_For the Mirror_.)    Canova, while living, was thought to be the first sculptor of the age,  and his works are still greatly admired--for their exquisite finishing,  and for their near resemblance to real life. They are certainly very  attractive, and may be contemplated a considerable time with delight;  but they never impose upon the beholder, and never raise in his mind  any of those sublime ideas which he invariably experiences while  contemplating the works of the ancients, or the modern productions of  Michael Angelo Buonarotti. Canova, in fact, though he possessed the  grace, the elegance, and the liveliness of the greatest masters of  Italy, could never surmount a certain degree of littleness, which  failure predominates in most of his works. The calm, tranquil, and  dignified pathos of Leonardo di Vinci cannot be traced in Canova's  countenances, which rather approach to those represented by Charles le  Brun, Eustache le Seur, and other French artists. Though his men were  generally deficient in dignity, the faces of his females were always  pleasing, notwithstanding      \"The sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul,\"    peculiar to most Italian women, is never found in his productions. It  does not appear likely that Canova, although his present admirers are  very numerous, will be greatly idolized by posterity. Indeed, if we  may be allowed to predict, his name, unlike that of his countryman,  Buonarotti, will sink into oblivion. He, however, enjoyed a high  reputation as an artist while he lived, and his sculpture is now eagerly  sought for by the lovers of the fine arts, both in Great Britain, and on  the continent.    Canova died at Venice, in the month of October, 1822. His death was  heard with extreme regret in Europe, and indeed in all parts of the  globe where his works were known.

Many attempts have been made to explain why the cock is sacred to  Minerva; and his claims to her protection are often founded on an  assumed preeminence of wisdom and sagacity. This brings to our mind a  story related by a gentleman, late resident in the Netherlands, of a  cock in a farm-yard somewhere in Holland, near Rotterdam, whose sagacity  saved him from perishing in a flood, occasioned by the bursting of one  of the dykes. The water rushing furiously and suddenly into the village,  swamped every house to the height of the first story, so that the  inhabitants were obliged to mount, and had no communication for awhile,  except by boats. The cattle and other animals and many fowls perished.  Our friend chanticleer, however, had the adroitness to jump into a large  wooden bowl, containing some barley, in which he eat, and quietly  floated, till the flood had subsided, having not only a good ship to  carry him, but provision on board during his voyage.    _Forster's Perennial Calendar._           *       *       *       *       *      GENERAL WOLFE.    The minds of some men are so elevated above the common understanding of  their fellow-creatures, that they are by many charged with enthusiasm,  and even with madness.

To show the extreme desire of sailors for fresh animal food, towards the  end of a long voyage, we may mention the following circumstance. A Dutch  East Indiaman, after beating about for some time in the Indian ocean,  became short of provisions. One day, as the crew were scrubbing the  deck, a large sea-snake raised itself out of the water, and sprang or  crawled aboard. The sailors, who for some time had not tasted _any  thing fresh_, immediately despatched the snake, and, regardless of  consequences, cooked and ate it for dinner--_Weekly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: New Suspension Bridge, Hammersmith.]        NEW SUSPENSION BRIDGE, HAMMERSMITH.    To the many improvements which have already taken place in the  neighbourhood of London, another will shortly be added; a  suspension-bridge, intended to facilitate the communication between  Hammersmith and Kingston, and other parts of Surrey. The clear water-way  is 688 feet 8 inches. The suspension towers are 48 feet above the level  of the roadway, where they are 22 feet thick. The roadway is slightly  curved upwards and is 16 feet above high water, and the extreme length  from the back of the piers on shore is 822 feet 8 inches, supporting 688  feet of roadway. There are eight chains, composed of wrought-iron bars,  each five inches deep and one thick. Four of these have six bars in each  chain; and four have only three, making thirty-six bars, which form a  dip in the centre of about 29 feet. From these, vertical rods are  suspended, which support the roadway, formed of strong-timbers covered  with granite. The width of the carriageway is 20 feet, and footway five  feet. The chains pass over the suspension towers, and are secured to the  piers on each shore. The suspension towers are of stone, and designed as  archways of the Tuscan order. The approaches are provided with octagonal  lodges, or toll-houses, with appropriate lamps and parapet walls,  terminating with stone pillars, surmounted with ornamental caps. The  whole cost of this remarkable object, displaying the great superiority  acquired by British artisans in the manufacture of ironwork, is about  80,000l. The advantages to be derived from this bridge in the saving of  distance, will be a direct passage from Hammersmith to Barnes, East  Sheen, and other parts of Surrey, without going over either Fulham or  Kew bridges.
