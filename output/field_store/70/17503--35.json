As is the life of leaves, so is that of      men. The leaves are scattered some of them to the earth by the wind,      others the wood putteth forth when it is in bloom, and they come on      in the season of spring. Even so of men one generation groweth,      another ceaseth.\"    He then told how he was a family friend of Diomedes and made with him  a compact that if they met in battle they should avoid each the other;  this they sealed by the exchange of armour, wherein the Greek had the  better, getting gold weapons for bronze, the worth of a hundred oxen for  the value of nine.    Coming to Troy Hector bade his mother offer Athena the finest robe she  had; yet all in vain, for the goddess rejected it. Passing to the house  of Paris, he found him polishing his armour, Helen at his side. Again  rebuking him, he had from him a promise that he would be ready to  re-enter the fight when Hector had been to his own house to see his wife  Andromache. Hector's heart foreboded that it was the last time he would  speak with her. She had with her their little son Astyanax. Weeping she  besought him to spare himself for her sake.        \"For me there will be no other comfort if thou meetest thy doom, but      sorrow. Father and mother have I none, for Achilles hath slain them      and my seven brothers. Hector, thou art my father and my lady mother      and my brother and thou art my wedded husband. Nay, come, pity me and      abide on the wall, lest thou make thy son an orphan and thy wife a      widow.\"    He answered, his heart heavy with a sense of coming death:        \"The day will come when Troy shall fall, yet I grieve not for father      or mother or brethren so much as for thee, when some Achaean leads      thee captive, robbing thee of thy day of freedom. Thou shalt weave at      the loom in Argos or perchance fetch water, for heavy necessity shall      be laid upon thee. Then shall many a one say when he sees thee shedding      tears: 'Lo, this is the wife of Hector who was the best warrior of the      Trojans when they fought for their town.' Thus will they speak and thou      shalt have new sorrow for lack of such a man to drive away the day of      slavery.\"    He stretched out his arms to his little son who was affrighted at the  sight of the helmet as it nodded its plumes dreadfully from its tall  top. Hector and Andromache laughed when they saw the child's terror;  then Hector took off his helmet and prayed that the boy might grow to a  royal manhood and gladden his mother's heart. Smiling through her tears,  Andromache took the child from Hector, while he comforted her with brave  words.        \"Lady, grieve not overmuch, I beseech thee, for no man shall thrust me      to death beyond my fate. Methinks none can avoid his destiny, be he      brave or a coward, when once he hath been born. Nay, go to the house,      ply thy tasks and bid the maids be busy, but war is the business of      the men who are born in Troy and mine most of all.\"    Thus she parted from him, looking back many a time, shedding plenteous  tears. So did they mourn for Hector even before his doom, for they said  he would never escape his foes and come back in safety.    Finding Paris waiting for him, Hector passed out to the battlefield.  Aided by Glaucus he wrought great havoc, so much that Athena and Apollo  stirred him to challenge the bravest of the Greeks. The victor was to  take the spoils of the vanquished but to return the body for burial. At  first the Greeks were silent when they heard his challenge, ashamed to  decline it and afraid to take it up. At last eight of their bravest cast  lots, the choice falling upon Ajax. A great combat ended in the somewhat  doubtful victory of Ajax, the two parting in friendship after an  exchange of presents. The result of the fighting had discouraged both  sides; the Greeks accordingly decided to throw up a mound in front  of their ships, protected by a deep trench. This tacit confession of  weakness in the absence of Achilles leads up to the heavy defeat which  was to follow. On the other side the Trojans held a council to deliver  up Helen. When Paris refused to surrender her but offered to restore her  treasures, a deputation was sent to inform the Greeks of his decision.  The latter refused to accept either Helen or the treasure, feeling that  the end was not far off. That night Zeus sent mighty thunderings to  terrify the besiegers.    So far the main plot of the _Iliad_ has been undeveloped; now that the  chief characters on both sides have played a part in the war, the poem  begins to show how the wrath of Achilles works itself out under Zeus'  direction. First the king of the gods warned the deities that he would  allow none to intervene on either side and would punish any offender  with his thunders. Holding up the scales of doom, he placed in them  the lot of Trojans and of Greeks; as the latter sank down, he hurled  at their host his lightnings, driving all the warriors in flight to the  great mound they had built. For a time Teucer the archer brother of  Ajax held them back, but when he was smitten by a mighty stone hurled  of Hector all resistance was broken. A vain attempt was made by Hera  and Athena to help the Greeks, but the goddesses quailed before the  punishment wherewith Zeus threatened them. When night came the Trojans  encamped on the open plain, their camp-fires gleaming like the stars  which appear on some night of stillness.    Disheartened at his defeat, Agamemnon freely acknowledged his fault and  suggested flight homewards. Nestor advised him to call an Assembly and  depute some of the leading men to make up the quarrel with Achilles.  The King listened to him, offering to give Achilles his own daughter in  wedlock, together with cities and much spoil of war. Three ambassadors  were chosen, Phoenix, Ajax and Odysseus. Reaching Achilles' tent, they  found him singing lays of heroes, Patroclus his friend by his side. When  he saw the ambassadors, he gave them a courtly welcome. Odysseus  laid the King's proposals before him, to which Achilles answered with  dignity.        \"I hate as sore as the gates of Death a man who hideth one thing in      his heart and sayeth its opposite. Do the sons of Atreus alone of      men love their wives? Methinks all the wealth which Troy contained      before the Greeks came upon it, yea all the wealth which Apollo holds      in rocky Pytho, is not the worth of life itself. Cattle and horses      and brazen ware can be got by plunder, but a man's life cannot be      taken by spoil nor recovered when once it passeth the barrier of his      teeth. Nay, go back to the elders and bid them find a better plan      than this. Let Phoenix abide by me here that he may return with me      to-morrow in my ships if he will, for I will not constrain him by      force.\"    Phoenix had been Achilles' tutor. In terror for the safety of the Greek  fleet, he appealed to his friend to relent.        \"How can I be left alone here without thee, dear child? Thy father      sent me to teach thee to be a speaker of words and a doer of deeds.      In thy childhood I tended thee, for I knew that I should never have a      son and I looked to thee to save me from ruin. Tame thy great spirit.      Even the gods know how to change, whose honour is greater, and their      power. Men in prayer turn them by sacrifice when any hath sinned and      transgressed. For Prayers are the daughters of great Zeus; they are      halt and wrinkled and their eyes look askance. Their task it is to go      after Ruin; for Ruin is strong and sound of foot, wherefore she far      outrunneth them all and getteth before them in harming men over all the      world. But they come after; whosoever honoureth the daughters of Zeus      when they come nigh, him they greatly benefit and hear his entreaties,      but whoso denieth them and stubbornly refuseth, they go to Zeus and ask      that Ruin may dog him, that he may be requited with mischief. Therefore,      Achilles, bring it to pass that honour follow the daughters of Zeus,      even that honour which bendeth the heart of others as noble as thou.\"    When this appeal also failed, Ajax, a man of deeds rather than words,  deemed it best to return at once, begging Achilles to bear them no  ill-will and to remember the rights of hospitality which protected them  from his resentment. When Achilles assured them of his regard for them  and maintained his quarrel with Agamemnon alone, they departed and  brought the heavy news to their anxious friends. On hearing it Diomedes  briefly bade them get ready for the battle and fight without Achilles'  help.    When the Trojan host had taken up its quarters on the plain, Nestor  suggested that the Greeks should send one of their number to find out  what Hector intended to do on the morrow. Diomedes offered to undertake  the office of a spy, selecting Odysseus as his comrade. After a prayer  to Athena to aid them, they went silently towards the bivouac. It  chanced that Hector too had thought of a similar plan and that Dolon  had offered to reconnoitre the Greek position. He was a wealthy man,  ill-favoured to look upon, but swift of foot, and had asked that his  reward should be the horses and the chariot of Achilles.    Hearing the sound of Dolon's feet as he ran, Diomedes and Odysseus  parted to let him pass between them; then cutting off his retreat they  closed on him and captured him. They learned how the Trojan host was  quartered; at the extremity of it was Rhesus, the newly arrived Thracian  King, whose white horses were a marvel of beauty and swiftness. In  return for his information Dolon begged them to spare his life, but  Diomedes deemed it safer to slay him. The two Greeks penetrated the  Thracian encampment, where they slew many warriors and escaped with the  horses back to the Greek"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#3)"],[1,"of old time  had come back again in the full glory of his legendary youth.    And long time they went up and down the terraces, saying those things  which were said before and since, and which lips shall yet be made to say  again. And above them stood Poltarnees beholding the Sea.    And the day came when Athelvok should go. And Hilnaric said to him:    \"Will you not indeed most surely come back again, having just looked over  the summit of Poltarnees?\"    Athelvok answered: \"I will indeed come back, for thy voice is more  beautiful than the hymn of the priests when they chant and praise the Sea,  and though many tributary seas ran down into Oriathon and he and all the  others poured their beauty into one pool below me, yet would I return  swearing that thou were fairer than they.\"    And Hilnaric answered:    \"The wisdom of my heart tells me, or old knowledge or prophecy, or some  strange lore, that I shall never hear thy voice again. And for this I give  thee my forgiveness.\"    But he, repeating the oath that he had sworn, set out, looking often  backwards until the slope became to step and his face was set to the rock.  It was in the morning that he started, and he climbed all the day with  little rest, where every foot-hole was smooth with many feet. Before he  reached the top the sun disappeared from him, and darker and darker grew  the Inner Lands. Then he pushed on so as to see before dark whatever thing  Poltarnees had to show. The dusk was deep over the Inner Lands, and the  lights of cities twinkled through the sea-mist when he came to  Poltarnees's summit, and the sun before him was not yet gone from the sky.    And there below him was the old wrinkled Sea, smiling and murmuring song.  And he nursed little ships with gleaming sails, and in his hands were old  regretted wrecks, and mast all studded over with golden nails that he had  rent in anger out of beautiful galleons. And the glory of the sun was  among the surges as they brought driftwood out of isles of spice, tossing  their golden heads. And the grey currents crept away to the south like  companionless serpents that love something afar with a restless, deadly  love. And the whole plain of water glittering with late sunlight, and the  surges and the currents and the white sails of ships were all together  like the face of a strange new god that has looked at a man for the first  time in the eyes at the moment of his death; and Athelvok, looking on the  wonderful Sea, knew why it was that the dead never return, for there is  something that the dead feel and know, and the living would never  understand even though the dead should come and speak to them about it.  And there was the Sea smiling at him, glad with the glory of the sun. And  there was a haven there for homing ships, and a sunlit city stood upon its  marge, and people walked about the streets of it clad in the unimagined  merchandise of far sea-bordering lands.    An easy slope of loose rock went from the top of Poltarnees to the shore  of the Sea.    For a long while Athelvok stood there regretfully, knowing that there had  come something into his soul that no one in the Inner Lands could  understand, where the thoughts of their minds had gone no farther than the  three little kingdoms. Then, looking long upon the wandering ships, and  the marvelous merchandise from alien lands, and the unknown colour that  wreathed the brows of the Sea, he turned his face to the darkness and the  Inner Lands.    At that moment the Sea sang a dirge at sunset for all the harm that he had  done in anger and all the ruin wrought on adventurous ships; and there  were tears in the voice of the tyrannous Sea, for he had loved the  galleons that he had overwhelmed, and he called all men to him and all  living things that he might make amends, because he had loved the bones  that he had strewn afar. And Athelvok turned and set one foot upon the  crumbled slope, and then another, and walked a little way to be nearer to  the Sea, and then a dream came upon him and he felt that men had wronged  the lovely Sea because he had been angry a little, because he had been  sometimes cruel; he felt that there was trouble among the tides of the Sea  because he had loved the galleons who were dead. Still he walked on and  the crumbled stones rolled with him, and just as the twilight faded and a  star appeared he came to the golden shore, and walked on till the surges  were about his knees, and he heard the prayer-like blessings of the Sea.  Long he stood thus, while the stars came out above him and shone again in  the surges; more stars came wheeling in their courses up from the Sea,  lights twinkled out through all the haven city, lanterns were slung from  the ships, the purple night burned on; and Earth, to the eyes of the gods  as they sat afar, glowed as with one flame. Then Athelvok went into the  haven city; there he met many who had left the Inner Lands before him;  none of them wished to return to the people who had not seen the Sea; many  of them had forgotten the three little kingdoms, and it was rumoured that  one man, who had once tried to return, had found the shifting, crumbled  slope impossible to climb.    Hilnaric never married. But her dowry was set aside to build a temple  wherein men curse the ocean.    Once every year, with solemn rite and ceremony, they curse the tides of  the Sea; and the moon looks in and hates them.          BLAGDAROSS      On a waste place strewn with bricks in the outskirts of a town twilight  was falling. A star or two appeared over the smoke, and distant windows  lit mysterious lights. The stillness deepened and the loneliness. Then all  the outcast things that are silent by day found voices.    An old cork spoke first. He said: \"I grew in Andalusian woods, but never  listened to the idle songs of Spain. I only grew strong in the sunlight  waiting for my destiny. One day the merchants came and took us all away  and carried us all along the shore of the sea, piled high on the backs of  donkeys, and in a town by the sea they made me into the shape that I am  now. One day they sent me northward to Provence, and there I fulfilled my  destiny. For they set me as a guard over the bubbling wine, and I  faithfully stood sentinel for twenty years. For the first few years in the  bottle that I guarded the wine slept, dreaming of Provence; but as the  years went on he grew stronger and stronger, until at last whenever a man  went by the wind would put out all his might against me, saying, 'Let me  go free; let me go free!' And every year his strength increased, and he  grew more clamourous when men went by, but never availed to hurl me from  my post. But when I had powerfully held him for twenty years they brought  him to the banquet and took me from my post, and the wine arose rejoicing  and leapt through the veins of men and exalted their souls within them  till they stood up in their places and sang Provencal songs. But me they  cast away--me that had been sentinel for twenty years, and was still as  strong and staunch as when first I went on guard. Now I am an outcast in a  cold northern city, who once have known the Andalusian skies and guarded  long ago Provencal suns that swam in the heart of the rejoicing wine.\"    An unstruck match that somebody had dropped spoke next. \"I am a child of  the sun,\" he said, \"and an enemy of cities; there is more in my heart than  you know of. I am a brother of Etna and Stromboli; I have fires lurking in  me that will one day rise up beautiful and strong. We will not go into  servitude on any hearth nor work machines for our food, but we will take  out own food where we find it on that day when we are strong. There are  wonderful children in my heart whose faces shall be more lively than the  rainbow; they shall make a compact with the North wind, and he shall lead  them forth; all shall be black behind them and black above them, and there  shall be nothing beautiful in the world but them; they shall seize upon  the earth and it shall be theirs, and nothing shall stop them but our old  enemy the sea.\"    Then an old broken kettle spoke, and said: \"I am the friend of cities. I  sit among the slaves upon the hearth, the little flames that have been fed  with coal. When the slaves dance behind the iron bars I sit in the middle  of the dance and sing and make our masters glad. And I make songs about  the comfort of the cat, and about the malice that is towards her in the  heart of the dog, and about the crawling of the baby, and about the ease  that is in the lord of the house when we brew the good brown tea; and  sometimes when the house is very warm and slaves and masters are glad, I  rebuke the hostile winds that prowl about the world.\"    And then there spoke the piece of an old cord. \"I was made in a place of  doom, and doomed men made my fibres, working without hope. Therefore there  came a grimness into my heart, so that I never let anything go free when  once I was set to bind it. Many a thing have I bound relentlessly for  months and years; for I used to come coiling into warehouses where the  great boxes lay all open to the air, and one of them would be suddenly  closed up, and my fearful strength would be set on him like accurse, and  if his timbers groaned when first I seized them, or if they creaked aloud  in the lonely night, thinking of woodlands out of which they came, then I  only gripped them tighter still, for the poor useless hate is in my soul  of those that made me in the place of doom. Yet, for all the things that  my prison-clutch has held, the last work that I did was to set something  free. I lay idle one night in the gloom on the warehouse floor. Nothing  stirred there, and even the spider slept. Towards midnight a great flock  of echoes suddenly leapt up from the wooden planks and circled round the  roof. A man was coming towards me all alone. And as he came his soul was  reproaching him, and I saw that there was a"]]]
