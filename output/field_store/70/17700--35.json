He appeared still more  gay and cheerful than the day before--made various inquiries about all our  mutual friends in England--spoke of them with affectionate interest, mixed  with a badinage in which none of their little defects were spared; indeed  candour obliges me to own that their defects seemed to have made a deeper  impression on his mind than their good qualities (though he allowed all  the latter) by the _gusto_ with which he entered into them.    He talked of our mutual friend Moore, and of his _Lalla Rookh_, which he  said, though very beautiful, had disappointed him, adding, that Moore  would go down to posterity by his _Melodies_, which were all perfect. He  said that he had never been so much _affected_ as on hearing Moore sing  some of them, particularly \"When first I met Thee,\" which, he said, made  him shed tears: \"But,\" added he, with a look full of archness, \"it was  after I had drunk a certain portion of very potent white brandy.\" As he  laid a peculiar stress on the word _affected_, I smiled, and the sequel of  the white brandy made me smile again: he asked me the cause, and I  answered that his observation reminded me of the story of a lady offering  her condolence to a poor Irishwoman on the death of her child, who stated  that she had never been more affected than on the event; the poor woman,  knowing the hollowness of the compliment, answered with all the quickness  of her country, \"Sure, then, Ma'am, that is saying a great deal, for you  were always affected.\" Lord Byron laughed, and said my _apropos_ was very  wicked--but I maintained it was very just. He spoke much more warmly of  Moore's social attractions as a companion, which he said were unrivalled,  than of his merits as a poet.    When Lord Byron came to dine with us on Thursday, he arrived an hour  before the usual time, and appeared in good spirits. He said that he found  the passages and stairs filled with people, who stared at him very much;  but he did not seem vexed at this homage, for so it certainly was meant,  as the Albergo della Ville, where we resided, being filled with English,  all were curious to see their distinguished countryman. He was very gay at  dinner, ate of most of the dishes, expressed pleasure at partaking of a  plum pudding, _a l'Anglaise_, made by one of our English servants; was  helped twice, and observed, that he hoped he should not shock us by eating  so much: \"But,\" added he, \"the truth is, that for several months I have  been following a most abstemious _regime_, living almost entirely on  vegetables; and now that I see a good dinner, I cannot resist temptation,  though to-morrow I shall suffer for my gormandize, as I always do when I  indulge in luxuries.\" He drank three glasses of champagne, saying, that as  he considered it a _jour de fete_, he would eat, drink, and be merry.    He talked of Mr. ----, who was then our Minister at Genoa. \"H----,\" said  he, \"is a thorough good-natured and hospitable man, keeps an excellent  table, and is as fond of good things as I am, but has not my forbearance.  I received, some time ago, a _Pate de Perigord_, and finding it excellent,  I determined on sharing it with H----; but here my natural selfishness  suggested that it would be wiser for me, who had so few dainties, to keep  this for myself, than to give it to H----, who had so many. After half an  hour's debate between selfishness and generosity, which do you think\"  (turning to me) \"carried the point?\"--I answered, \"Generosity, of  course.\"--\"No, by Jove!\" said he, \"no such thing; selfishness in this case,  as in most others, triumphed; I sent the _pate_ to my friend H----,  because I felt another dinner off it would play the deuce with me; and so  you see, after all, he owed the _pate_ more to selfishness than  generosity.\" Seeing us smile at this, he said:--\"When you know me better,  you will find that I am the most selfish person in the world; I have,  however, the merit, if it be one, of not only being perfectly conscious of  my faults, but of never denying them; and this surely is something, in  this age of cant and hypocrisy.\"    In all his conversations relative to Lady Byron, and they are frequent, he  declares that he is totally unconscious of the cause of her leaving him,  but suspects that the illnatured interposition of Mrs. Charlemont led to  it. It is a strange business! He declares that he left no means untried to  effect a reconciliation, and always adds with bitterness, \"A day will  arrive when I shall be avenged. I feel that I shall not live long, and  when the grave has closed over me, what must she feel?\" All who wish well  to Lady Byron must desire that she should not survive her husband, for the  all-atoning grave that gives oblivion to the errors of the dead, clothes  those of the living in such sombre colours to their own too-late awakened  feelings, as to render them wretched for life, and more than avenges the  real, or imagined wrongs of those we have lost for ever.    When Lord Byron was praising the mental and personal qualifications of  Lady Byron, I asked him how all that he now said agreed with certain  sarcasms supposed to bear a reference to her, in his works. He smiled,  shook his head, and said they were meant to spite and vex her, when he was  wounded and irritated at her refusing to receive or answer his letters;  that he was not sincere in his implied censures, and that he was sorry he  had written them; but notwithstanding this regret, and all his good  resolutions to avoid similar sins, he might on renewed provocation recur  to the same vengeance, though he allowed it was petty and unworthy of him.  Lord Byron speaks of his sister, Mrs. Leigh, constantly, and always with  strong expressions of affection; he says she is the most faultless person  he ever knew, and that she was his only source of consolation in his  troubles on the separation.    Byron is a great talker, his flippancy ceases in a _tete-a-tete_, and he  becomes sententious, abandoning himself to the subject and seeming to  think aloud, though his language has the appearance of stiffness, and is  quite opposed to the trifling chit-chat that he enters into when in  general society. I attribute this to his having lived so much alone, as  also to the desire he now professes of applying himself to prose writing.  He affects a sort of Johnsonian tone, likes very much to be listened to,  and seems to observe the effect he produces on his hearer. In mixed  society his ambition is to appear the man of fashion, he adopts a light  tone of badinage and persiflage that does not sit gracefully on him, but  is always anxious to turn the subject to his own personal affairs, or  feelings, which are either lamented with an air of melancholy, or dwelt on  with playful ridicule, according to the humour he happens to be in.    Byron has remarkable penetration in discovering the characters of those  around him, and he piques himself extremely on it: he also thinks he has  fathomed the recesses of his own mind; but he is mistaken: with much that  is _little_ (which he suspects) in his character, there is much that is  great, that he does not give himself credit for: his first impulses are  always good, but his temper, which is impatient, prevents his acting on  the cool dictates of reason; and it appears to me, that in judging himself,  Byron mistakes temper for character, and takes the ebullitions of the  first, for the indications of the nature of the second. He declares, that  in addition to his other failings, avarice is now established. This new  vice, like all the others, he attributes to himself, he talks of as one  would name those of an acquaintance, in a sort of deprecating, yet half  mocking tone; as much as to say, you see I know all my faults better than  you do, though I don't choose to correct them: indeed, it has often  occurred to me, that he brings forward his defects, as if in anticipation  of some one else exposing them, which he would not like; as though he  affects the contrary, he is jealous of being found fault with, and shows  it in a thousand ways.    He affects to dislike hearing his works praised or referred to; I say  affects, because I am sure it is not real or natural; as he who loves  praise, as Byron evidently does, in other things, cannot dislike it for  that in which he must be conscious it is deserved. He refers to his feats  in horsemanship, shooting at a mark, and swimming, in a way that proves he  likes to be complimented on them; and nothing appears to give him more  satisfaction than being considered a man of fashion, who had great success  in fashionable society in London, when he resided there. He is peculiarly  compassionate to the poor; I remarked that he rarely, in our rides, passed  a mendicant without giving him charity, which was invariably bestowed with  gentleness and kindness; this was still more observable if the person was  deformed, as if he sympathized with the object.    Byron is very fond of gossiping, and of hearing what is going on in the  London fashionable world; his friends keep him _au courant_, and any  little scandal amuses him very much. I observed this to him one day, and  added, that I thought his mind had been too great to descend to such  trifles! he laughed and said with mock gravity, \"Don't you know that the  trunk of an elephant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#4)"],[1,"of that memorable day. They pitied the young king,  who was unconsciously ruining his country, and threw all the odium of  his proceedings on Mazarin. Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to  Conde were suggested. Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest  favor.    D'Artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just  as if his horse and he had been made of iron. Mazarin and Guitant  conversed together in whispers. The musketeers, who had already  discovered who Mazarin was, followed in profound silence. In the street  of Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by  the name of Quinze-Vingts. Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns,  asking how matters were progressing.    \"Ah, captain!\" said the officer, \"everything is quiet hereabout--if I  did not know that something is going on in yonder house!\"    And he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon  the Vaudeville now stands.    \"In that hotel? it is the Hotel Rambouillet,\" cried Guitant.    \"I really don't know what hotel it is; all I do know is that I observed  some suspicious looking people go in there----\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Guitant, with a burst of laughter; \"those men must  be poets.\"    \"Come, Guitant, speak, if you please, respectfully of these gentlemen,\"  said Mazarin; \"don't you know that I was in my youth a poet? I wrote  verses in the style of Benserade----\"    \"You, my lord?\"    \"Yes, I; shall I repeat to you some of my verses?\"    \"Just as you please, my lord. I do not understand Italian.\"    \"Yes, but you understand French,\" and Mazarin laid his hand upon  Guitant's shoulder. \"My good, my brave Guitant, whatsoever command I may  give you in that language--in French--whatever I may order you to do,  will you not perform it?\"    \"Certainly. I have already answered that question in the affirmative;  but that command must come from the queen herself.\"    \"Yes! ah yes!\" Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke; \"I know your devotion  to her majesty.\"    \"I have been a captain in the queen's guards for twenty years,\" was the  reply.    \"En route, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal; \"all goes well in  this direction.\"    D'Artagnan, in the meantime, had taken the head of his detachment  without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks  the character of an old soldier.    He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche. The Rue Richelieu and the  Rue Villedot were then, owing to their vicinity to the ramparts, less  frequented than any others in that direction, for the town was thinly  inhabited thereabout.    \"Who is in command here?\" asked the cardinal.    \"Villequier,\" said Guitant.    \"Diavolo! Speak to him yourself, for ever since you were deputed by me  to arrest the Duc de Beaufort, this officer and I have been on bad  terms. He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards.\"    \"I am aware of that, and I have told him a hundred times that he was  wrong. The king could not give that order, since at that time he was  hardly four years old.\"    \"Yes, but I could give him the order--I, Guitant--and I preferred to  give it to you.\"    Guitant, without reply, rode forward and desired the sentinel to call  Monsieur de Villequier.    \"Ah! so you are here!\" cried the officer, in the tone of ill-humor  habitual to him; \"what the devil are you doing here?\"    \"I wish to know--can you tell me, pray--is anything fresh occurring in  this part of the town?\"    \"What do you mean? People cry out, 'Long live the king! down with  Mazarin!' That's nothing new; no, we've been used to those acclamations  for some time.\"    \"And you sing chorus,\" replied Guitant, laughing.    \"Faith, I've half a mind to do it. In my opinion the people are right;  and cheerfully would I give up five years of my pay--which I am never  paid, by the way--to make the king five years older.\"    \"Really! And pray what would come to pass, supposing the king were five  years older than he is?\"    \"As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands  himself, and 'tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV. than  the son of Peter Mazarin. 'Sdeath! I would die willingly for the king,  but supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin, as your  nephew came near being to-day, there could be nothing in Paradise,  however well placed I might be there, that could console me for it.\"    \"Well, well, Monsieur de Villequier,\" Mazarin interposed, \"I shall make  it my care the king hears of your loyalty. Come, gentlemen,\" addressing  the troop, \"let us return.\"    \"Stop,\" exclaimed Villequier, \"so Mazarin was here! so much the better.  I have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him. I  am obliged to you Guitant, although your intention was perhaps not very  favorable to me, for such an opportunity.\"    He turned away and went off to his post, whistling a tune then popular  among the party called the \"Fronde,\" whilst Mazarin returned, in a  pensive mood, toward the Palais Royal. All that he had heard from these  three different men, Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, confirmed him in  his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on  his side except the queen; and then Anne of Austria had so often  deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious. During the  whole of this nocturnal ride, during the whole time that he was  endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges, Guitant  and Villequier, Mazarin was, in truth, studying more especially one man.  This man, who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the  mob--not a muscle of whose face was stirred, either at Mazarin's  witticisms or by the jests of the multitude--seemed to the cardinal a  peculiar being, who, having participated in past events similar to those  now occurring, was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of  taking place.    The name of D'Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin, who, although  he did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635, that is to  say, about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in  a preceding narrative, * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of  one who was said to be a model of courage, address and loyalty.        * _\"The Three Musketeers.\"_    Possessed by this idea, the cardinal resolved to know all about  D'Artagnan immediately; of course he could not inquire from D'Artagnan  himself who he was and what had been his career; he remarked, however,  in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke  with a Gascon accent. Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much  alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them  may say of himself; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais  Royal, the cardinal knocked at a little door, and after thanking  D'Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal,  he made a sign to Guitant to follow him.    They both dismounted, consigned their horses to the lackey who had  opened the door, and disappeared in the garden.    \"My dear friend,\" said the cardinal, leaning, as they walked through the  garden, on his friend's arm, \"you told me just now that you had been  twenty years in the queen's service.\"    \"Yes, it's true. I have,\" returned Guitant.    \"Now, my dear Guitant, I have often remarked that in addition to your  courage, which is indisputable, and your fidelity, which is invincible,  you possess an admirable memory.\"    \"You have found that out, have you, my lord? Deuce take it--all the  worse for me!\"    \"How?\"    \"There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a  courtier is to know when to forget.\"    \"But you, Guitant, are not a courtier. You are a brave soldier, one of  the few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV. Alas! how few to-day  exist!\"    \"Plague on't, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out  of me?\"    \"No; I only brought you here to ask you,\" returned Mazarin, smiling, \"if  you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers?\"    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan? I have had no occasion to notice him particularly;  he's an old acquaintance. He's a Gascon. De Treville knows him and  esteems him very highly, and De Treville, as you know, is one of the  queen's greatest friends. As a soldier the man ranks well; he did his  whole duty and even more, at the siege of Rochelle--as at Suze and  Perpignan.\"    \"But you know, Guitant, we poor ministers often want men with other  qualities besides courage; we want men of talent. Pray, was not Monsieur  d'Artagnan, in the time of the cardinal, mixed up in some intrigue from  which he came out, according to report, quite cleverly?\"    \"My lord, as to the report you allude to\"--Guitant perceived that the  cardinal wished to make him speak out--\"I know nothing but what the  public knows. I never meddle in intrigues, and if I occasionally become  a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will  approve of my keeping them secret.\"    Mazarin shook his head.    \"Ah!\" he said; \"some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they  wish to know.\"    \"My lord,\" replied Guitant, \"such ministers do not weigh men in the same  balance; they get their information on war from warriors; on intrigues,  from intriguers. Consult some politician of the period of which you  speak, and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you  want.\"    \"Eh, pardieu!\" said Mazarin, with a grimace which he always made when  spoken to about money. \"They will be paid, if there is no way of getting  out of it.\"    \"Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the  cabals of that day?\"    \"By Bacchus!\" rejoined Mazarin, impatiently, \"it's about an hour since I  asked you for that very thing, wooden-head that you are.\"    \"There is one man for whom I can answer, if he will speak out.\"    \"That's my concern; I will"]]]
