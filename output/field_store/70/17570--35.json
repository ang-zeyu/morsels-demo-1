BAKER and JAMES S. FINDLEY          The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History received from J. R.  Alcorn and Albert A. Alcorn a sizable collection of mammals taken in the  summer of 1951 in Alaska. In addition to visiting localities at which  they had collected in 1947 and 1948 (see Baker, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus.  Nat. Hist., 5:87-117, 1951) the Alcorns obtained specimens from  localities not previously visited in the vicinity of Anchorage and  Haines and from Sullivan Island, a small, timbered island in the Lynn  Canal. A part of the funds for field work was made available by the  Kansas University Endowment Association. The loan of specimens for  comparative study from the Biological Surveys Collection of the United  States National Museum is acknowledged.    =_Sorex obscurus alascensis_= Merriam. Dusky Shrew.--Comparison of two  specimens from 7 miles SSE Haines and eight from Sullivan Island (six  from the northeast end of the island and two from the southeast end)  with topotypes of _Sorex obscurus longicauda_ Merriam from Wrangell,  Alaska, and with topotypes of _Sorex obscurus alascensis_ from Yakutat,  Alaska, shows that our specimens are intermediate between the two named  kinds. However in nine of ten characters these specimens more closely  resemble _S. o. alascensis_ than _S. o. longicauda_. Measurements of  specimens from Wrangell and from localities progressively northward  along the Alaskan coast reveal a decrease in size of the skull in a  clinal fashion. Specimens from Sullivan Island are larger than those  from the mainland south of Haines, which are in turn larger than  specimens from 9 miles W and 4 miles N of Haines (reported upon by  Baker, _op. cit._). No step is apparent in this cline and assignment of  specimens must be made on a somewhat arbitrary basis. Specimens from  Juneau, Alaska, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United  States National Museum, were assigned by Jackson (N. Amer. Fauna, 51:  128, 1928) to _S. o. alascensis_ but seem to us to be closer to _S. o.  longicauda_.    =_Sorex palustris navigator_= (Baird). Water Shrew.--Two males taken on  August 5, at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage  provide a northwestern extension of the known range of this species. In  external and cranial characters the males resemble _S. p. navigator_  from 9 miles W and 4 miles N of Haines, Alaska, and from Washington  County, Idaho. The specimens from Peters Creek do not agree with the  description of _Sorex alaskanus_ Merriam as given by Jackson (_op.  cit._:189) although one, a second year animal, has the lambdoidal crests  exceptionally well developed, as does _S. alaskanus_.    =_Myotis lucifugus lucifugus_= (LeConte). Little Brown Myotis.--A male  taken at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, is  darker than specimens assigned to this subspecies from northeastern  British Columbia (Muncho Lake). Eight skins and skulls (three adults and  five young of the year) and 18 specimens in alcohol taken at Screw  Creek, elevation 2600 ft., mile 742 (10 miles S and 50 miles E Teslin,  Yukon Territory), British Columbia, seem typical of _M. l. lucifugus_.  These were obtained on August 11, 1951, at the same locality where on  July 1, 1947, a single bat assigned to _M. l. alascensis_ Miller was  taken (see Baker, _op. cit._:95). The latter specimen is readily  distinguished by its darker color both above and below from those taken  in 1951.    =_Tamiasciurus hudsonicus kenaiensis_= Howell. Red Squirrel.--A female  taken at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, is  referred to this subspecies after comparison with the published  description of _T. h. kenaiensis_ Howell (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,  49:136, 1936), with specimens of _T. h. preblei_ Howell from Yerrick  Creek, Alaska, and with _T. h. petulans_ (Osgood) from 1 mile S of  Haines.    =_Tamiasciurus hudsonicus petulans_= (Osgood). Red Squirrel.--Three  specimens were taken on Chilkat Peninsula, elevation 10 ft., 7 miles SSE  of Haines, Alaska, and one at the southeast end of Sullivan Island.  These squirrels, taken in June and July, are molting on the sides, back  and rump. Compared with the specimens from the mainland the male from  Sullivan Island is paler on the back--near (_h_) Ochraceous-Tawny  instead of near (14_j_) Sudan Brown (capitalized color terms from  Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,  1912)--and paler on the tail; otherwise this specimen resembles those  from the mainland.    =_Peromyscus maniculatus algidus_= Osgood. Deer Mouse.--Osgood (N. Amer.  Fauna, 28:54, 1909) reported intergradation between _P. m. algidus_ and  _P. m. hylaeus_ Osgood in the \"region of Lynn Canal.\" One female from  the mouth of the Endicott River, elevation 10 ft., seems referable to  _algidus_. In comparison with two topotypes of _hylaeus_ this specimen  is not so dark and more nearly agrees with _algidus_ from the Chilkat  River, from 1 mile W of Haines and from Dezadeash Lake, Yukon Territory.    =_Phenacomys intermedius mackenzii_= Preble. Mountain Phenacomys.--An  adult female was taken on 28 July at the southwestern end of Dezadeash  Lake, elevation 2400 ft., in Yukon Territory (approximately 60 miles  from the Alaskan boundary north of the Lynn Canal), the same place where  a specimen was obtained in 1948 (see Baker, _op. cit._:104).    =_Microtus longicaudus littoralis_= Swarth. Long-tailed Vole.--Six of  these voles were taken on Sullivan Island (two at the northeast end and  four at the southeast end) and another was trapped on the mainland at  the mouth of the Endicott River. All seven resemble _M. l. littoralis_  from the vicinity of Haines. One large adult male from the island has  the following measurements: Total length, 202; length of tail, 71;  length of hind foot, 21; height of ear from notch, 13.    =_Microtus oeconomus macfarlani_= Merriam. Tundra Vole.--Five specimens  from 5 miles NNE of Gulkana, Alaska, 1700 ft., and four from Peters  Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, Alaska, are assigned  to this subspecies. In color they resemble _macfarlani_ from eastern  Alaska (14 miles E and 25 miles N of Fairbanks) and are darker than _M.  o. operarius_ (Nelson) from Tyonek, but judging from the description by  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 17:41, 1900), are not so dark as _M. o.  yakutatensis_ Merriam. These mice were taken inland from the coast. It  is likely that the coastal population more nearly resembles either  _operarius_ or _yakutatensis_.    =_Erethizon dorsatum myops_= Merriam. Porcupine.--Skulls of two females  obtained from the Chilkat Peninsula, elevation 10 ft., 7 miles SSE of  Haines, Alaska, agree with those of the same sex of _myops_ from Yerrick  Creek, Alaska, and from 2 miles W of the Teslin River, Yukon Territory.  The skull of the older animal has the longer nasals and more pronounced  cranial ridges, which perhaps indicate a tendency toward _E. d.  nigrescens_ Allen, which occurs to the southward (see Anderson, Canadian  Jour. Res., 21:304, 1943).    _Transmitted October 8, 1953._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34326"],[0,"A New Hylid Frog from Eastern Mexico."],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net.

Words surrounded by underscores, like _this_, signifies  words in italics.]          A New Hylid Frog from Eastern Mexico    By    EDWARD H. TAYLOR      A small collection of Mexican reptiles and amphibians recently acquired  by the University of Kansas Natural History Museum contains five  specimens of a species of the genus _Hyla_ (_sensu lato_) which is here  described as new.      ~Hyla proboscidea~ sp. nov.    _Type._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, No. 23626,  collected 2 km. west of Jico, Veracruz, Mexico, at an elevation of 4,200  ft., Oct. 28, 1946, by Walter W. Dalquest.    _Paratypes._--Nos. 23624, 23625, 23627, 23628, collected with the type.    _Diagnosis._--A medium sized member of the genus with known maximum  length of male, 57 mm. Canthus rostralis well defined; tip of snout with  a bulbous projection; fingers more than one-third webbed, foot nearly  completely webbed; tympanum distinct; skin smooth above, granular below;  very prominent inner metatarsal tubercle, small outer tubercle;  tibiotarsal articulation reaches to nostril; a well-defined outer tarsal  fold; anal opening ventral, covered by a free triangular flap; pupil of  eye horizontal.    _Description of the type._--Head longer than broad, the distance between  the eye and nostril slightly greater than distance between nostril and  tip of snout; canthus rostralis sharply defined, continued to above  nostril; upper part of loreal region sloping abruptly, lower part  sloping more gently to edge of lip; area in front of nostril somewhat  swollen, the nostril large, directed strongly backward; tip of snout  forming a short rounded proboscis; upper jaw rather strongly overhanging  lower jaw.    Width of an upper eyelid contained in interorbital distance about 1-1/3  times; horizontal diameter of eye about equal to distance between eye  and nostril, about 1-1/3 times diameter of tympanum; tympanum distinct,  its distance from orbit equal to its diameter, overhung by a glandular  fold running back from eye.    Choanae large; vomerine teeth in two elevated patches which lie between,  and reach the posterior level, of choanae, the patches closer to each  other than to choanae; tongue rather small, subcircular, not or but very  indistinctly notched behind, not at all free behind; opening to vocal  sacs behind level of tongue, the openings a short slit directed  backwards. (Vocal sacs not evident externally in type or paratypes.)    Skin of dorsal surfaces generally smooth (under magnification surface  minutely corrugated and wrinkled); ventral surface of abdomen, the  thighs, and lower part of lateral surface of body strongly granulate,  the granules unequal in size and elevation; breast, chin, and under side  of arm with sparse granules or tubercles.    Anal opening ventral, covered by a small, free, triangular flap; a small  thickened fold, slightly free, on each side of anus partly covered by  triangular flap.    [Illustration: _Measurements_ (in mm.).--Snout to vent, 58; leg, 86;  head length, 20; head width, 18.6.]    Arms rather short, upper arm slender, forearm much thickened; a small  axillary web present; disks on three outer fingers distinctly larger  than tympanum, of first finger equal to or somewhat smaller than  tympanum; outer fingers, between one-third and one-half webbed; on inner  fingers webbing less than one-third; first finger more or less opposed  to other three, its base widened, and the upper surface covered by a  large patch of minute dark, horn-colored nuptial asperities, that extend  to near the terminal disk; subarticular tubercles strongly elevated with  numerous supernumerary tubercles on palm; a somewhat enlarged elevated  palmar tubercle; under surface of forearm with a row of distinct  tubercles; other smaller scattered granules present. Toes more than  four-fifths webbed, the membrane reaching the base of the terminal  disks, on one side at least, of all toes save fourth; subarticular  tubercles strongly elevated, with numerous supernumerary tubercles on  sole; a large elevated inner metatarsal tubercle; a small outer  tubercle; a continuous, well-defined, tarsal fold extending entire  length of tarsus. Tibiotarsal articulation reaches nostril when leg is  brought forward.    _Color and marking._--General color of type (preserved in formalin, then  transferred to alcohol) dull grayish purple, darker anteriorly and  somewhat lighter and more mottled posteriorly; color very much lighter  on sides with a few cream, dark-edged spots in groin and on sides of  abdomen; front and back surfaces of thigh and shank with some darker and  lighter flecking that is continued more or less on the foot. When  submerged in water, very dim dark spots or bars visible on limbs;  ventral surface dirty brownish flesh, without markings.    _Variation._--The series consists of five adult male specimens. It is  presumed that the female is considerably larger, and may lack the nasal  proboscis which I suspect is a secondary sexual character.    There are some differences in the shade of coloring in the preserved  specimens, some being darker, some lighter than the type. In two the  lateral dark-edged, cream spots extend to the axilla, and the light and  dark markings on the front and back surfaces of the leg are much more  distinct in most of the specimens than in the type. When the specimens  are submerged in water, the black bars on the limbs are evident in all  specimens. The tympanum is sometimes darker, sometimes lighter than its  surroundings.    In the field notes of Mr. Dalquest I find the statement that the color  in life is bright yellow, which presumably applies to all of the  specimens. No trace of this color remains at the present time.    The ventral granules of some of the paratypes are very unequal in  elevation, some being elongated, nipplelike.    The following table gives the variation in measurements of the type and  paratypes:      Measurements of _Hyla proboscidea_ in mm.    =======+=======+========+=======+=====+=====+==========+==========         | Snout |        |       |     |     | Foot and |         |  to   |  Head  | Head  | Arm | Leg | longest  |   Eye         | vent  | length | width |     |     |   toe    | diameter  -------+-------+--------+-------+-----+-----+----------+----------  23626  |  58   |  20    | 18.6  | 29  | 86  |   39     |    5  23625  |  56   |  19    | 18    | 29  | 81  |   37     |    5  23627  |  53   |  18.5  | 17    | 30  | 81  |   35     |    5  23624  |  50   |  16.8  | 15.5  | 26  | 70  |   29.8   |    5  23628  |  50   |  17    | 16    | 28  | 71  |   30     |    5  -------+-------+--------+-------+-----+-----+----------+----------    _Relationship._--It would appear that the relationship of this species  is with _Hyla bistincta_, a widespread Mexican species likewise  occurring in the same general area but at a much higher elevation. It  also has an elongated flap which carries the anal opening nearly to the  level of venter but the terminal part lacks the triangular flap. There  is no prolongation of the snout tip. There are also numerous other  differences, so that it would be difficult to confuse the two forms.    _Remarks._--This adds another very distinctive species to the  Veracrucian fauna. Despite the fact that this state has probably been  explored at greater length than any other Mexican state it still is a  likely place for the discovery of novelties.         _Transmitted April 8, 1948._"]]]
