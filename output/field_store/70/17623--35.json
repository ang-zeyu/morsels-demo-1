He was very fond of fun and  laughter, and though he had quite made up his mind to buy Tom, he was  now teasing Haley, and pretending to think that he was asking too much  money for him.    [Illustration]    'Papa do buy him, it's no matter what you pay', whispered Eva softly,  putting her arms around her father's neck. 'You have money enough, I  know. I want him.'    'What for, pussy? Are you going to use him for a rattle-box, or a  rocking-horse, or what?'    'I want to make him happy.'    Mr. St. Clare laughed; but after making a few more jokes about it, he  gave Haley the money he asked for, and Tom had a new master.    'Come, Eva,' said Mr. St. Clare, and, taking her hand, went across the  boat to Tom.    'Look up, Tom,' he said to him, 'and see how you like your new master.'    Tom looked up. Mr. St. Clare had such a gay, young, handsome face, that  Tom could not help feeling glad. Grateful tears rushed to his eyes as he  said, 'God bless you, mas'r.'    'Can you drive horses, Tom?'    'I've been allays used to horses,' said Tom.    'Well, I think I'll make you a coachman. But you must not get drunk.'    Tom looked surprised and a little hurt.    'I never drink', mas'r,' he said.    'Never mind, my boy,' said Mr. St. Clare, seeing him look so grave; 'I  don't doubt you mean to do well.'    'I certainly do, mas'r,' said Tom.    'And you shall have good times,' said Eva. 'Papa is very good to  everybody, only he always will laugh at them.'    'Papa is much obliged to you,' said Mr. St. Clare laughing, as he walked  away.          CHAPTER VIII      ELIZA AMONG THE QUAKERS      While Uncle Tom was sailing South, down the wide river, to his new  master's home, Eliza with her boy was travelling north to Canada.    Kind people helped her all the way. She passed from friend to friend,  till she arrived safely at a village where the people were Quakers.    The Quakers were gentle, quiet people. They all dressed alike in plain  grey clothes, and the women wore big, white muslin caps. Because they  thought it was wicked to have slaves, they helped those who ran away  from their cruel masters. Often they were punished for doing this, but  still they went on helping the poor slaves. For though the laws said it  was wrong, they felt quite sure that it was really right to do so.    The kind Quaker women grew to be very fond of Eliza, and would have been  glad if she would have stayed with them.    But Eliza said, 'No, I must go on; I dare not stop. I can't sleep at  night: I can't rest. Last night I dreamed I saw that man come into the  yard.'    'Poor child,' said Rachel, the kind Quaker woman to whom she was  speaking, 'poor child, thee mustn't feel so. No slave that has run away  has ever been stolen from our village. It is safe here.'    While they were talking, Simeon, Rachel's husband, came to the door and  called, 'Wife, I want to speak to thee a minute.'    Rachel went out to him. 'Eliza's husband is here,' he said.    'Art thee sure?' asked Rachel, her face bright with joy.    'Yes, quite certain; he will be here soon. Will thee tell her?'    Rachel went back into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and, opening  the door of a small bedroom, said gently, 'Come in here with me, my  daughter; I have news to tell thee.'    Eliza rose trembling, she was so afraid it was bad news.    'No, no! never fear thee. It's good news, Eliza,' said Simeon,    Rachel shut the door, and drew Eliza towards her. 'The Lord has been  very good to thee,' she said gently. 'Thy husband hath escaped, and will  be here to-night.'    'To-night!' repeated Eliza, 'to-night!'    Then it seemed as if the room and everything in it swam round her, and  she fell into Rachel's arms.    Very gently Rachel laid her down on the bed. Eliza slept as she had not  slept since the dreadful night when she had taken her boy and run away  through the cold, dark night.    She dreamed of a beautiful country--a land, it seemed to her, of  rest--green shores, pleasant islands, and lovely glittering water. There  in a house, which kind voices told her was her home, she saw Harry  playing happily. She heard her husband's footstep. She felt him coming  nearer. His arms were around her, his tears falling upon her face, and  she awoke.    It was no dream. The sun had set, the candles were lit. Harry was  sleeping by her side, and George, her husband, was holding her in his  arms.          CHAPTER IX      UNCLE TOM'S NEW HOME      Uncle Tom soon settled down in his new home. He was as happy as he could  be, so far away from his wife and dear little children. He had a kind  master.    Mrs. St. Clare, however, was not nearly so nice as her husband. She was  cruel, and would often have beaten her poor slaves, but Mr. St. Clare  would not allow it.    She always pretended that she was very ill, and spent most of her time  lying on a sofa, or driving about in her comfortable carriage.    Mrs. St. Clare said she really was too ill to look after the house, so  everything was left to the slaves. Soon things began to be very  uncomfortable, and even good-natured Mr. St. Clare could stand it no  longer.    He went to his cousin, Miss Ophelia St. Clare, and begged her to come  and keep house for him, and to look after Eva. It was on the journey  back with her that the accident to Eva happened, which ended in his  buying Tom.    Miss Ophelia was a very prim and precise person, not at all like the  St. Clares. In her home people did not have slaves. Though her cousin  had a great many, and was kind to them, she could not help seeing that  it was a very wicked thing to buy and sell men and women as if they were  cattle. She was very, very sorry for the poor slaves, and would have  liked to free them all. Yet she did not love them. She could not bear  even to have them near her, nor to touch them, just because they were  black.    [Illustration]    It made her quite ill to see Eva kissing and hugging the black slave  women when she came home.    'Well, I couldn't do that,' she said.    'Why not?' said Mr. St. Clare, who was looking on.    'Well, I want to be kind to every one. I wouldn't have anybody hurt.  But, as to kissing niggers--' she gave a little shudder. 'How can she?'    Presently a gay laugh sounded from the court. Mr. St. Clare stepped out  to see what was happening.    'What is it?' said Miss Ophelia, following him.    There sat Tom on a little mossy seat in the court. Every one of his  buttonholes was stuck full of flowers. Eva, laughing gaily, was hanging  a wreath of roses round his neck. Then, still laughing, she perched on  his knee like a little sparrow.    'Oh, Tom, you look so funny!'    Tom had a sober smile on his face. He seemed in his own quiet way to be  enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress. When he lifted  his eyes and saw his master he looked as if he were afraid he might be  scolded. But Mr. St. Clare only smiled.    'How can you let her do that?' said Miss Ophelia.    'Why not?' said Mr. St. Clare.    'Why? I don't know. It seems dreadful to me.'    'You would think it was quite right and natural if you saw Eva playing  with a large dog, even if he was black. But a fellow-creature that can  think, and reason, and feel, and is immortal, you shudder at. I know how  you north-country people feel about it. You loathe the blacks as you  would a toad or a snake. Yet you pity them, and are angry because they  are often ill-treated.'    'Well, cousin,' said Miss Ophelia thoughtfully, 'I daresay you are  right. I suppose I must try to get over my feeling.'          CHAPTER X      UNCLE TOM'S LETTER      Uncle Tom felt that he was indeed very fortunate to have found such a  kind master and so good a home. He had nice clothes, plenty of food, and  a comfortable room to sleep in. He had no hard, disagreeable work to do.  His chief duties were to drive Mrs. St. Clare's carriage when she wanted  to go out, and to attend on Eva when she wanted him. He soon grew to  love his little mistress very, very much indeed.    Mr. St. Clare too began to find Tom very useful. He was dreadfully  careless about money, and his chief servant was just as careless as his  master. So between them a great deal was not only spent but wasted.    Mr. Shelby had trusted Tom in everything, and Tom had always been  careful of his master's money--as careful as if it had been his own.  Waste seemed dreadful to him, and he tried to do something to stop it  now.    Mr. St. Clare was not long in finding out how clever Tom was, and soon  trusted him as thoroughly as Mr. Shelby had done.    But in spite of all his good fortune, Tom used to long very much to go  home to see his dear ones again. He had plenty of spare time, and  whenever he had nothing to do he would pull his Bible out of his pocket  and try to find comfort in reading it.    [Illustration]    But as time went on, Uncle Tom longed more and more for his home. At  last one day he had a grand idea. He would write a letter.    Before Uncle Tom was sold, George Shelby had been teaching him to write  so he thought he could manage a letter.    He begged a sheet of writing-paper from Eva, and going to his room began  to make a rough copy on his slate.    It was very difficult. Poor Uncle Tom found that he had quite forgotten  how to make some of the letters. Of those he did remember, he was not  quite sure which he ought to use. Yes, it was a very difficult thing  indeed.    While he was working away, breathing very hard over it, Eva came behind  him, and peeped over his shoulder.    'Oh, Uncle Tom! what funny things you are making there!'    Eva put her little golden head close to Uncle Tom's black one, and the  two began a grave and anxious talk over the letter. They were both very  earnest, and both very ignorant. But after a great deal of consulting  over every word, the writing began, they really thought, to look quite  like a proper letter.    'Yes, Uncle Tom, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#4)"],[1,"armed it with the sword against Christianity,  but the hypothesis becomes highly probable when we have realised the  indifferentism of the Muhammedan conquerors.    We shall constantly see hereafter how much they owed in every  department of intellectual life to the teaching of the races which  they subjugated. Their attitude towards other beliefs was never so  intolerant as was that of Christendom at that period. Christianity may  well have been the teaching influence in this department of life as in  others. Moreover at all times and especially in the first century the  position of Christians has been very tolerable, even though the  Muslims regarded them as an inferior class, Christians were able to  rise to the highest offices of state, even to the post of vizier,  without any compulsion to renounce their faith. Even during the period  of the crusades when the religious opposition was greatly intensified,  again through Christian policy, Christian officials cannot have been  uncommon: otherwise Muslim theorists would never have uttered their  constant invectives against the employment of Christians in  administrative duties. Naturally zealots appeared at all times on the  Muhammedan as well as on the Christian side and occasionally isolated  acts of oppression took place: these were, however, exceptional. So  late as the eleventh century, church funeral processions were able to  pass through the streets of Bagdad with all the emblems of  Christianity and disturbances were recorded by the chroniclers as  exceptional. In Egypt, Christian festivals were also regarded to some  extent as holidays by the Muhammedan population. We have but to  imagine these conditions reversed in a Christian kingdom of the early  middle ages and the probability of my theory will become obvious.    The Christians of the East, who had broken for the most part with the  orthodox Church, also regarded Islam as a lesser evil than the  Byzantine established Church. Moreover Islam, as being both a  political and ecclesiastical organisation, regarded the Christian  church as a state within a state and permitted it to preserve its own  juridical and at first its own governmental rights. Application was  made to the bishops when anything was required from the community and  the churches were used as taxation offices. This was all in the  interests of the clergy who thus found their traditional claims  realised. These relations were naturally modified in the course of  centuries; the crusades, the Turkish wars and the great expansion of  Europe widened the breach between Christianity and Islam, while as the  East was gradually brought under ecclesiastical influence, the  contrast grew deeper: the theory, however, that the Muhammedan  conquerors and their successors were inspired by a fanatical hatred of  Christianity is a fiction invented by Christians.    We have now to examine this early development of Islam in somewhat  greater detail: indeed, to secure a more general appreciation of this  point is the object of the present work.    The relationship of the Qoran to Christianity has been already noted:  it was a book which preached rather than taught and enounced isolated  laws but no connected system. Islam was a clear and simple war-cry  betokening merely a recognition of Arab supremacy, of the unity of God  and of Muhammed's prophetic mission. But in a few centuries Islam  became a complex religious structure, a confusion of Greek philosophy  and Roman law, accurately regulating every department of human life  from the deepest problems of morality to the daily use of the  toothpick, and the fashions of dress and hair. This change from the  simplicity of the founder's religious teaching to a system of  practical morality often wholly divergent from primitive doctrine, is  a transformation which all the great religions of the world have  undergone. Religious founders have succeeded in rousing the sense of  true religion in the human heart. Religious systems result from the  interaction of this impulse with pre-existing capacities for  civilisation. The highest attainments of human life are dependent upon  circumstances of time and place, and environment often exerts a more  powerful influence than creative power. The teaching of Jesus was  almost overpowered by the Graeco-Oriental culture of later Hellenism.  Dissensions persist even now because millions of people are unable to  distinguish pure religion from the forms of expression belonging to an  extinct civilisation. Islam went through a similar course of  development and assumed the spiritual panoply which was ready to hand.  Here, as elsewhere, this defence was a necessity during the period of  struggle, but became a crushing burden during the peace which followed  victory, for the reason that it was regarded as inseparable from the  wearer of it. From this point of view the analogy with Christianity  will appear extremely striking, but it is something more than an  analogy: the Oriental Hellenism of antiquity was to Christianity that  which the Christian Oriental Hellenism of a few centuries later was to  Islam.    We must now attempt to realise the nature of this event so important  in the history of the world. A nomadic people, recently united, not  devoid of culture, but with a very limited range of ideas, suddenly  gains supremacy over a wide and populous district with an ancient  civilisation. These nomads are as yet hardly conscious of their  political unity and the individualism of the several tribes composing  it is still a disruptive force: yet they can secure domination over  countries such as Egypt and Babylonia, with complex constitutional  systems, where climatic conditions, the nature of the soil and  centuries of work have combined to develop an intricate administrative  system, which newcomers could not be expected to understand, much less  to recreate or to remodel. Yet the theory has long been held that the  Arabs entirely reorganised the constitutions of these countries.  Excessive importance has been attached to the statements of Arab  authors, who naturally regarded Islam as the beginning of all things.  In every detail of practical life they regarded the prophet and his  contemporaries as their ruling ideal, and therefore naturally assumed  that the constitutional practices of the prophet were his own  invention. The organisation of the conquering race with its tribal  subordination was certainly purely Arab in origin. In fact the  conquerors seemed so unable to adapt themselves to the conditions with  which they met, that foreigners who joined their ranks were admitted  to the Muhammedan confederacy only as clients of the various Arab  tribes. This was, however, a mere question of outward form: the  internal organisation continued unchanged, as it was bound to continue  unless chaos were to be the consequence. In fact, pre-existing  administrative regulations were so far retained that the old customs  duties on the former frontiers were levied as before, though they  represented an institution wholly alien to the spirit of the  Muhammedan empire. Those Muhammedan authors, who describe the  administrative organisation, recognise only the taxes which Islam  regarded as lawful and characterise others as malpractices which had  crept in at a later date. It is remarkable that these so-called  subsequent malpractices correspond with Byzantine and Persian usage  before the conquest: but tradition will not admit the fact that these  remained unchanged. The same fact is obvious when we consider the  progress of civilisation in general. In every case the Arabs merely  develop the social and economic achievements of the conquered races to  further issues. Such progress could indeed only be modified by a  general upheaval of existing conditions and no such movement ever took  place. The Germanic tribes destroyed the civilisations with which they  met; they adopted many of the institutions of Christian antiquity, but  found them an impediment to the development of their own genius. The  Arabs simply continued to develop the civilisation of post-classical  antiquity, with which they had come in contact.    This procedure may seem entirely natural in the department of economic  life, but by no means inevitable where intellectual progress is  concerned. Yet a similar course was followed in either case, as may be  proved by dispassionate examination. Islam was a rising force, a faith  rather of experience than of theory or dogma, when it raised its  claims against Christianity, which represented all pre-existing  intellectual culture. A settlement of these claims was necessary and  the military triumphs are but the prelude to a great accommodation of  intellectual interests. In this Christianity played the chief part,  though Judaism is also represented: I am inclined, however, to think  that Jewish ideas as they are expressed in the Qoran were often  transmitted through the medium of Christianity. There is no doubt that  in Medina Muhammed was under direct Jewish influence of extraordinary  power. Even at that time Jewish ideas may have been in circulation,  not only in the Qoran but also in oral tradition, which afterwards  became stereotyped: at the same time Muhammed's utterances against the  Jews eventually became so strong during the Medina period, for  political reasons, that I can hardly imagine the traditions in their  final form to have been adopted directly from the Jews. The case of  Jewish converts is a different matter. But in Christianity also much  Jewish wisdom was to be found at that time and it is well known that  even the Eastern churches regarded numerous precepts of the Old  Testament, including those that dealt with ritual, as binding upon  them. In any case the spirit of Judaism is present, either directly or  working through Christianity, as an influence wherever Islam  accommodated itself to the new intellectual and spiritual life which  it"]]]
