The mother has been sewing on some large garment which lies across  her lap. She lets the little girl work by herself for a time, and then  stops to set her right. Already a considerable length of stocking  has been made, but this is a place where close attention is needed.  Perhaps it is time to begin shaping the heel. The mother's work  is left altogether for a moment. Putting her arm about the child's  shoulder, she takes the two little hands in hers, and guides the  fingers holding the needles.    We get some idea of the quaint style of the building from this glimpse  of the living-room. Probably it is a low stone cottage with thatched  or tiled roof. The deep window seat shows how thick the walls are.  Overhead we see the oak rafters.    The room looks spotlessly clean, as a good housewife's should. Though  we see only a corner, that corner holds the most precious household  possession, the linen chest. It stands against the wall, and is of  generous size. French country people take great pride in storing up a  quantity of linen; tablecloths, sheets, shirts, pillowcases, often  of their own weaving, are piled in the deep clothes-presses. In  well-to-do families there are enough for six months' use, the family  washing taking place only twice a year, in spring and fall, like  house-cleaning in America. We judge that our housekeeper is well  provided, by the pile of neatly folded sheets on the press. The little  clock, high on the wall, and the vase of flowers on the chest are  the only touches of ornament in the room. On the wall are some small  objects which look like shuttles for weaving.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE KNITTING LESSON]    As we look at the picture we feel sure that Millet was a lover of  children, and it is pleasant to know that he had many of his own. The  artist father was his children's favorite playmate, and at the close  of his day's work in his studio, they ran to meet him with shouts of  joy. He used to like to walk about the garden with them showing them  the flowers. In winter time they sat together by the fire, and the  father sang songs and drew pictures for the little ones. Sometimes  taking a log from the wood basket he would carve a doll out of it, and  paint the cheeks with vermilion. This is the sort of doll we see on  the window seat in our picture.    Ruskin tells us that a true artist feels like a caged bird in painting  any enclosed space, unless it contains some opening like a door or  window. No amount of beauty will content us, he says, if we are shut  in to that alone. Our picture is a good proof of this principle. We  can easily fancy how different the effect would be without the window:  the room would appear almost like a prisoner's cell. As it is, the  great window suggests the out-of-door world into which it opens, and  gives us a sense of larger space.    Our illustration is taken from a drawing. Millet was a painstaking  artist who made many drawings and studies for his paintings. This is  probably such a study, as there is also a painting by him of the same  subject very similar to this.          III    THE POTATO PLANTERS      In the picture called The Potato Planters we are reminded at once  of the peasants we have already seen in Going to Work. We see here  married people a few years older than the young people of the other  picture working together in the fields.    It may be that this is their own little plot of ground, for they work  with a certain air of proprietorship. They look prosperous, too, and  are somewhat better dressed than common laborers. It is the highest  ambition of the French peasant to own a bit of land. He will make any  sacrifice to get it, and possessing it, is well content. He labors  with constant industry to make it yield well.    The field here is at quite a distance from the village where the  workers live. We can see the little group of houses on the horizon. In  France the agricultural classes do not build their dwelling-houses on  their farms, but live instead in village communities, with the  farms in the outlying districts. The custom has many advantages. The  families may help one another in various ways both by joining forces  and exchanging services. They may also share in common the use of  church, school, and post office. This French farming system has been  adopted in Canada, while in our own country we follow the English  custom of building isolated farmhouses.    In working season the French farmer must go daily to his labor at  a distance. The people in our picture are fortunate enough to own  a donkey which is their burden-bearer between house and field. The  strong little creature can carry a heavy load properly disposed in  pannier baskets. The panniers are made very deep and wide, but rather  flat, so as to fit the sides of the donkey. With one of these hanging  on each side of the saddle, the weight of the burden is so well  distributed that it is easily borne.    The donkey of our picture has been relieved of his panniers, and now  rests in the shade of some apple-trees. One of the baskets is in the  mean time put to a novel use. Made soft and warm with a heavy cloak,  it forms a nice cradle for the baby. The babies in French peasant  families are often left at home with the grandmother, while the mother  goes out to field work. The painter Millet himself was in childhood  the special charge of his grandmother, while his mother labored on the  farm. The people of our picture have another and, as it seems, a much  pleasanter plan, in going to the field as a family party.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE POTATO PLANTERS]    The day is well advanced and the work goes steadily on. It is potato  planting, and the potato crop is of great importance to country  people, second perhaps to the wheat, as it supplies food to both man  and beast. The commoner varieties, as the large white, are raised for  cattle, and the finer and sweeter kinds, the red and the yellow, are  kept for the table.    The laborer and his wife move along the field, facing each other on  opposite sides of the row they are planting. The man turns the sod  with his hoe, a short-handled tool which long practice has taught him  to use skilfully. The wife carries the potato seed in her apron, and  as her husband lifts each spadeful of earth, she throws the seed into  the hole thus made. He holds the hoe suspended a moment while the seed  drops in, and then replaces the earth over it. The two work in perfect  unison, each following the other's motion with mechanical regularity,  as they move down the field together.    The two who work so well together in the field are sure to work well  together in the home. The man has the serious, capable look of a  provident husband. The woman looks like a good housewife. That shapely  hand throwing the seed so deftly into the ground is well adapted to  domestic tasks.    We may easily identify our picture as a familiar scene in Millet's  Barbizon surroundings. We are told that \"upon all sides of Barbizon,  save one, the plain stretches almost literally as far as the eye can  reach,\" and presents \"a generally level and open surface.\" \"There are  no isolated farmhouses, and no stone walls, fences, or hedges,  except immediately around the villages; and were it not all under  cultivation, the plain might be taken for a vast common.\"[1]    It is evident, then, that we here see the plain of Barbizon and true  Barbizon peasants of Millet's day. The villagers of the painter's  acquaintance were on the whole a prosperous class, nearly all owning  their houses and a few acres of ground. The big apple-tree under which  the donkey rests is just such an one as grew in Millet's own little  garden.    Fruit trees were his peculiar delight. He knew all their ways,  and \"all their special twists and turnings;\" how the leaves of the  apple-tree are bunched together on their twigs, and how the roots  spread under ground. \"Any artist,\" he used to say, \"can go to the East  and paint a palm-tree, but very few can paint an apple-tree.\"      [Footnote 1: From Edward Wheelwright's _Recollections of Jean Francois  Millet,_ in _Atlantic Monthly_, September, 1876.]          IV    THE WOMAN SEWING BY LAMPLIGHT      Though the peasant women of France have so large a share in the  laborious out-of-door work on the farms, they are not unfitted for  domestic duties. In the long winter evenings they devote themselves  to more distinctly woman's tasks, knitting and sewing, sometimes even  spinning and weaving. Their housekeeping is very simple, for they live  frugally, but they know how to make the home comfortable. Many modern  inventions are still unknown to them, and we should think their  customs very primitive, but on this account they are perhaps even more  picturesque.    There is contentment in every line of the face of this Woman Sewing by  Lamplight. It is the face of a happy young wife and mother. She  sits close by her baby's bedside that she may listen to his gentle  breathing as he sleeps, and she smiles softly to herself while she  sews. It is a sweet face which bends over the work, and it is framed  in the daintiest of white caps edged with a wide ruffle which is  turned back over the hair above the forehead, that it may not shade  her eyes.    The garment that lies on her lap is of some coarse heavy material. No  dainty bit of fancy work is this, but a plain piece of mending. It  may be the long cloak which the shepherd wraps about him in cold and  stormy weather. Made from the wool grown on his own sheep, spun by his  wife's own hand, it is unrivalled among manufactured cloths for warmth  and comfort. The needle is threaded with a coarse thread of wool,  which the sewer draws deftly through the cloth.

Higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner; but  the pride, the hope, the joy, The Luck, of Roaring Camp had disappeared.  They were returning with sad hearts when a shout from the bank recalled  them.    It was a relief-boat from down the river. They had picked up, they  said, a man and an infant, nearly exhausted, about two miles below. Did  anybody know them, and did they belong here?    It needed but a glance to show them Kentuck lying there, cruelly crushed  and bruised, but still holding The Luck of Roaring Camp in his arms. As  they bent over the strangely assorted pair, they saw that the child was  cold and pulseless. \"He is dead,\" said one. Kentuck opened his eyes.  \"Dead?\" he repeated feebly. \"Yes, my man, and you are dying too.\" A  smile lit the eyes of the expiring Kentuck. \"Dying!\" he repeated; \"he's  a-taking me with him. Tell the boys I've got The Luck with me now;\" and  the strong man, clinging to the frail babe as a drowning man is said to  cling to a straw, drifted away into the shadowy river that flows forever  to the unknown sea.          THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT      As Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler, stepped into the main street of Poker  Flat on the morning of the twenty-third of November, 1850, he was  conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the preceding  night. Two or three men, conversing earnestly together, ceased as he  approached, and exchanged significant glances. There was a Sabbath lull  in the air which, in a settlement unused to Sabbath influences, looked  ominous.    Mr. Oakhurst's calm, handsome face betrayed small concern in these  indications. Whether he was conscious of any predisposing cause was  another question. \"I reckon they're after somebody,\" he reflected;  \"likely it's me.\" He returned to his pocket the handkerchief with which  he had been whipping away the red dust of Poker Flat from his neat  boots, and quietly discharged his mind of any further conjecture.    In point of fact, Poker Flat was \"after somebody.\" It had lately  suffered the loss of several thousand dollars, two valuable horses, and  a prominent citizen. It was experiencing a spasm of virtuous reaction,  quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that had provoked  it. A secret committee had determined to rid the town of all improper  persons. This was done permanently in regard of two men who were then  hanging from the boughs of a sycamore in the gulch, and temporarily in  the banishment of certain other objectionable characters. I regret to  say that some of these were ladies. It is but due to the sex, however,  to state that their impropriety was professional, and it was only in  such easily established standards of evil that Poker Flat ventured to  sit in judgment.    Mr. Oakhurst was right in supposing that he was included in this  category. A few of the committee had urged hanging him as a possible  example, and a sure method of reimbursing themselves from his pockets  of the sums he had won from them. \"It's agin justice,\" said Jim Wheeler,  \"to let this yer young man from Roaring Camp--an entire stranger--carry  away our money.\" But a crude sentiment of equity residing in the  breasts of those who had been fortunate enough to win from Mr. Oakhurst  overruled this narrower local prejudice.    Mr. Oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness, none the  less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his judges. He was  too much of a gambler not to accept Fate. With him life was at best an  uncertain game, and he recognized the usual percentage in favor of the  dealer.    A body of armed men accompanied the deported wickedness of Poker Flat to  the outskirts of the settlement. Besides Mr. Oakhurst, who was known to  be a coolly desperate man, and for whose intimidation the armed  escort was intended, the expatriated party consisted of a young woman  familiarly known as the \"Duchess\"; another, who had won the title of  \"Mother Shipton\"; and \"Uncle Billy,\" a suspected sluice-robber and  confirmed drunkard. The cavalcade provoked no comments from the  spectators, nor was any word uttered by the escort. Only, when the gulch  which marked the uttermost limit of Poker Flat was reached, the leader  spoke briefly and to the point. The exiles were forbidden to return at  the peril of their lives.    As the escort disappeared, their pent-up feelings found vent in a  few hysterical tears from the Duchess, some bad language from Mother  Shipton, and a Parthian volley of expletives from Uncle Billy. The  philosophic Oakhurst alone remained silent. He listened calmly to Mother  Shipton's desire to cut somebody's heart out, to the repeated statements  of the Duchess that she would die in the road, and to the alarming oaths  that seemed to be bumped out of Uncle Billy as he rode forward. With the  easy good humor characteristic of his class, he insisted upon exchanging  his own riding horse, \"Five Spot,\" for the sorry mule which the Duchess  rode. But even this act did not draw the party into any closer sympathy.  The young woman readjusted her somewhat draggled plumes with a feeble,  faded coquetry; Mother Shipton eyed the possessor of \"Five Spot\" with  malevolence, and Uncle Billy included the whole party in one sweeping  anathema.    The road to Sandy Bar--a camp that, not having as yet experienced the  regenerating influences of Poker Flat, consequently seemed to offer some  invitation to the emigrants--lay over a steep mountain range. It was  distant a day's severe travel. In that advanced season, the party soon  passed out of the moist, temperate regions of the foothills into  the dry, cold, bracing air of the Sierras. The trail was narrow and  difficult. At noon the Duchess, rolling out of her saddle upon the  ground, declared her intention of going no farther, and the party  halted.    The spot was singularly wild and impressive. A wooded amphitheater,  surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite, sloped  gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlooked the valley.  It was, undoubtedly, the most suitable spot for a camp, had camping been  advisable. But Mr. Oakhurst knew that scarcely half the journey to Sandy  Bar was accomplished, and the party were not equipped or provisioned  for delay. This fact he pointed out to his companions curtly, with a  philosophic commentary on the folly of \"throwing up their hand before  the game was played out.\" But they were furnished with liquor, which in  this emergency stood them in place of food, fuel, rest, and prescience.  In spite of his remonstrances, it was not long before they were more or  less under its influence. Uncle Billy passed rapidly from a bellicose  state into one of stupor, the Duchess became maudlin, and Mother Shipton  snored. Mr. Oakhurst alone remained erect, leaning against a rock,  calmly surveying them.    Mr. Oakhurst did not drink. It interfered with a profession which  required coolness, impassiveness, and presence of mind, and, in his own  language, he \"couldn't afford it.\" As he gazed at his recumbent fellow  exiles, the loneliness begotten of his pariah trade, his habits of life,  his very vices, for the first time seriously oppressed him. He bestirred  himself in dusting his black clothes, washing his hands and face, and  other acts characteristic of his studiously neat habits, and for a  moment forgot his annoyance. The thought of deserting his weaker and  more pitiable companions never perhaps occurred to him. Yet he could not  help feeling the want of that excitement which, singularly enough, was  most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he was notorious. He  looked at the gloomy walls that rose a thousand feet sheer above the  circling pines around him; at the sky, ominously clouded; at the valley  below, already deepening into shadow. And, doing so, suddenly he heard  his own name called.    A horseman slowly ascended the trail. In the fresh, open face of the  newcomer Mr. Oakhurst recognized Tom Simson, otherwise known as the  \"Innocent\" of Sandy Bar. He had met him some months before over  a \"little game,\" and had, with perfect equanimity, won the entire  fortune--amounting to some forty dollars--of that guileless youth. After  the game was finished, Mr. Oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind  the door and thus addressed him: \"Tommy, you're a good little man, but  you can't gamble worth a cent. Don't try it over again.\" He then handed  him his money back, pushed him gently from the room, and so made a  devoted slave of Tom Simson.    There was a remembrance of this in his boyish and enthusiastic greeting  of Mr. Oakhurst. He had started, he said, to go to Poker Flat to seek  his fortune. \"Alone?\" No, not exactly alone; in fact (a giggle), he had  run away with Piney Woods. Didn't Mr. Oakhurst remember Piney? She that  used to wait on the table at the Temperance House? They had been engaged  a long time, but old Jake Woods had objected, and so they had run away,  and were going to Poker Flat to be married, and here they were. And they  were tired out, and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp and  company. All this the Innocent delivered rapidly, while Piney, a stout,  comely damsel of fifteen, emerged from behind the pine tree, where she  had been blushing unseen, and rode to the side of her lover.    Mr. Oakhurst seldom troubled himself with sentiment, still less with  propriety; but he had a vague idea that the situation was not fortunate.  He retained, however, his presence of mind sufficiently to kick Uncle  Billy, who was about to say something, and Uncle Billy was sober enough  to recognize in Mr. Oakhurst's kick a superior power that would not  bear trifling. He then endeavored to dissuade Tom Simson from delaying  further, but in vain. He even pointed out the fact that there was no  provision, nor means of making a camp. But, unluckily, the Innocent met  this objection by assuring the party that he was "]]]
