To learn  the length of the year needed only patient observation--a  characteristic of the Chinese; but many younger nations got into a  terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year's length.    It is stated that in 2159 B.C. the royal astronomers Hi and Ho failed  to predict an eclipse. It probably created great terror, for they were  executed in punishment for their neglect. If this account be true, it  means that in the twenty-second century B.C. some rule for calculating  eclipses was in use. Here, again, patient observation would easily  lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the  Chaldeans as the _Saros_. It consists of 235 lunations, and in  that time the pole of the moon's orbit revolves just once round the  pole of the ecliptic, and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle  are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle, and so  on for many centuries.    It may be that the neglect of their duties by Hi and Ho, and their  punishment, influenced Chinese astronomy; or that the succeeding  records have not been available to later scholars; but the fact  remains that--although at long intervals observations were made of  eclipses, comets, and falling stars, and of the position of the  solstices, and of the obliquity of the ecliptic--records become rare,  until 776 B.C., when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some  approach to continuity. Shortly afterwards notices of comets were  added. Biot gave a list of these, and Mr. John Williams, in 1871,  published _Observations of Comets from 611 B.C. to 1640 A.D.,  Extracted from the Chinese Annals_.    With regard to those centuries concerning which we have no  astronomical Chinese records, it is fair to state that it is recorded  that some centuries before the Christian era, in the reign of  Tsin-Chi-Hoang, all the classical and scientific books that could be  found were ordered to be destroyed. If true, our loss therefrom is as  great as from the burning of the Alexandrian library by the Caliph  Omar. He burnt all the books because he held that they must be either  consistent or inconsistent with the Koran, and in the one case they  were superfluous, in the other case objectionable.    _Chaldaeans_.--Until the last half century historians were  accustomed to look back upon the Greeks, who led the world from the  fifth to the third century B.C., as the pioneers of art, literature,  and science. But the excavations and researches of later years make us  more ready to grant that in science as in art the Greeks only  developed what they derived from the Egyptians, Babylonians, and  Assyrians. The Greek historians said as much, in fact; and modern  commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty. Since,  however, the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been  recognised that the Babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter  of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era.    The Chaldaeans, being the most ancient Babylonians, held the same  station and dignity in the State as did the priests in Egypt, and  spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy, and the  arts of divination and astrology. They held that the world of which we  have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending,  in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine  providence, and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance, nor by  their own will, but by the determinate will and appointment of the  gods. They recorded these movements, but mainly in the hope of tracing  the will of the gods in mundane affairs. Ptolemy (about 130 A.D.)  made use of Babylonian eclipses in the eighth century B.C. for  improving his solar and lunar tables.    Fragments of a library at Agade have been preserved at Nineveh, from  which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into  constellations, which were known by the names which they bear to this  day, and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the  courses of the sun, moon, and of the five planets Mercury, Venus,  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.    We have records of observations carried on under Asshurbanapal, who  sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena. Here  is one:--    To the Director of Observations,--My Lord, his humble servant  Nabushum-iddin, Great Astronomer of Nineveh, writes thus: \"May Nabu  and Marduk be propitious to the Director of these Observations, my  Lord. The fifteenth day we observed the Node of the moon, and the moon  was eclipsed.\"    The Phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation,  but there are no records. The Egyptian priests tried to keep such  astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves. It is probable  that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses. All that was  known to the Greeks about Egyptian science is to be found in the  writings of Diodorus Siculus. But confirmatory and more authentic  facts have been derived from late explorations. Thus we learn from  E. B. Knobel[2] about the Jewish calendar dates, on records of land  sales in Aramaic papyri at Assuan, translated by Professor A. H. Sayce  and A. E. Cowley, (1) that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used  by the Jews in the fifth century B.C. [the present reformed Jewish  calendar dating from the fourth century A.D.], a date a \"little more  than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those  whose business is recorded had fled into Egypt with Jeremiah\" (Sayce);  and (2) that the order of intercalation at that time was not  dissimilar to that in use at the present day.    Then again, Knobel reminds us of \"the most interesting discovery a few  years ago by Father Strassmeier of a Babylonian tablet recording a  partial lunar eclipse at Babylon in the seventh year of Cambyses, on  the fourteenth day of the Jewish month Tammuz.\"  Ptolemy, in the  Almagest (Suntaxis), says it occurred in the seventh year of Cambyses,  on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the Egyptian month  Phamenoth.  Pingre and Oppolzer fix the date July 16th, 533 B.C. Thus  are the relations of the chronologies of Jews and Egyptians  established by these explorations.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] These ancient dates are uncertain.    [2] _R. A. S. Monthly Notices_, vol. lxviii., No. 5, March, 1908.        3. ANCIENT GREEK ASTRONOMY.      We have our information about the earliest Greek astronomy from  Herodotus (born 480 B.C.). He put the traditions into writing. Thales  (639-546 B.C.) is said to have predicted an eclipse, which caused much  alarm, and ended the battle between the Medes and Lydians. Airy fixed  the date May 28th, 585 B.C. But other modern astronomers give  different dates. Thales went to Egypt to study science, and learnt  from its priests the length of the year (which was kept a profound  secret!), and the signs of the zodiac, and the positions of the  solstices. He held that the sun, moon, and stars are not mere spots on  the heavenly vault, but solids; that the moon derives her light from  the sun, and that this fact explains her phases; that an eclipse of  the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun's light from her. He  supposed the earth to be flat, and to float upon water. He determined  the ratio of the sun's diameter to its orbit, and apparently made out  the diameter correctly as half a degree. He left nothing in writing.    His successors, Anaximander (610-547 B.C.) and Anaximenes (550-475  B.C.), held absurd notions about the sun, moon, and stars, while  Heraclitus (540-500 B.C.)  supposed that the stars were lighted each  night like lamps, and the sun each morning. Parmenides supposed the  earth to be a sphere.    Pythagoras (569-470 B.C.) visited Egypt to study science. He deduced  his system, in which the earth revolves in an orbit, from fantastic  first principles, of which the following are examples: \"The circular  motion is the most perfect motion,\" \"Fire is more worthy than earth,\"  \"Ten is the perfect number.\" He wrote nothing, but is supposed to have  said that the earth, moon, five planets, and fixed stars all revolve  round the sun, which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire  called the Antichthon. Copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed  Pythagoras as the founder of the system which he, Copernicus, revived.    Anaxagoras (born 499 B.C.) studied astronomy in Egypt. He explained  the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the  flat earth in the night. He held that in a solar eclipse the moon  hides the sun, and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth's  shadow--both excellent opinions. But he entertained absurd ideas of  the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky, there  to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars. He was prosecuted  for this unsettling opinion, and for maintaining that the moon is an  inhabited earth. He was defended by Pericles (432 B.C.).    Solon dabbled, like many others, in reforms of the calendar. The  common year of the Greeks originally had 360 days--twelve months of  thirty days. Solon's year was 354 days. It is obvious that these  erroneous years would, before long, remove the summer to January and  the winter to July. To prevent this it was customary at regular  intervals to intercalate days or months. Meton (432 B.C.) introduced a  reform based on the nineteen-year cycle. This is not the same as the  Egyptian and Chaldean eclipse cycle called _Saros_ of 223  lunations, or a little over eighteen years.  The Metonic cycle is 235  lunations or nineteen years, after which period the sun and moon  occupy the same position relative to the stars. It is still used for  fixing the date of Easter, the number of the year in Melon's cycle  being the golden number of our prayer-books.  Melon's system divided  the 235 lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every  sixty-third"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8177"],[0,"The Esperanto Teacher: A Simple Course for Non-Grammarians (#3)"],[1,"child.                      mia : my, mine.      nia : our, ours.                    cia : thy, thine.    via : your, yours,                    lia : his.           ilia : their, theirs.                    sxia : her, hers.    sia (see Lesson 7),                    gxia : its.

In order to understand the meaning of a sentence it is necessary to be  able to recognise clearly and unmistakably what it is that is spoken  about, that is, what the \"subject of the sentence\" is. In English this  is often to be recognised only by its position in the sentence. For  instance, the three words--visited, John, George, can be arranged to  mean two entirely, different things, either \"John visited George,\" or  \"George visited John.\" [Footnote: In teaching Esperanto to children it  is well to make sure before going further that they thoroughly  understand, what the subject is. The subject is that which we think or  speak about. The word which stands for it is the subject of the  sentence. The children may be required to underline the subject of each  sentence in a suitable piece of prose or verse.] In Esperanto the sense  does not depend on the arrangement-- \"Johano vizitis Georgon\" and  \"Georgon vizitis Johano\" mean exactly the same thing, that John visited  George, the \"n\" at the end of \"Georgon\" showing that \"Georgon\" is not  the subject. There is no want of clearness about the following  (Esperanto) sentences, absurd as they are in English:--                   La   patron  mordis  la   hundo.                 The  father   bit    the   dog.                   La  infanon   gratis    la   kato.                 The  child   scratched  the  cat.                   La  birdojn  pafis  Johano.                 The  birds   shot    John.                   La   musojn  kaptis  la  knabo.                 The   mice   caught  the  boy.                   La   kokidon  mangxis  la   onklo.                 The  chicken    ate    the  uncle.                   La   bildon   pentris  la  pentristo.                 The  picture  painted  the  painter.                   La   fisxojn  vendis  la   fisxisto.                 The   fish     sold   the  fisherman.    In these sentences the subjects are at once seen to be \"hundo, kato,  Johano, knabo, onklo, pentristo, fisxisto\", for the final \"n\" in  \"patron, infanon, birdojn, musojn, kokidon, bildon, fisxojn\",  distinguishes these words from the subject.    This use of \"n\" renders clear sentences that are not clear in English.  \"John loves Mary more than George\" may mean \"more than John loves  George\" or \"more than George loves Mary.\" In Esperanto it is quite  clear. \"Johano amas Marion, pli ol Georgo\" means \"more than George loves  Mary,\" because \"Georgo\" is the subject of the second (elliptical)  sentence, but \"Johano amas Marion, pli ol Georgon\" means \"more than  John loves George,\" because the final \"n\" in Georgon shows this to be  not the subject.    There are cases, however, in which it is not necessary to add \"n\", the  noun or pronoun being distinguished from the subject in another way.  Examples are found in the first exercise:--\"Sur la tero\" kusxas sxtono,  \"On the ground\" lies a stone. \"Antaux la pordo\" staras arbo, \"Before the  door\" stands a tree. Notwithstanding their position, \"ground\" and \"door\"  are seen to be not the subject, because before them are the words \"on,\"  \"before,\" which connect them with the rest of the sentence--it is \"on  the ground,\" \"before the door.\" So with other sentences.    The words \"on\", \"before\", and others given [in Lesson 26] are called  PREPOSITIONS (\"pre\" = before). The noun or pronoun which follows them  can never be the subject of the sentence.    Remember, then, that    \"N\" is added to every noun and pronoun, \"other than the subject\", unless  it has a preposition before it. [Footnote: (i.). The explanation usually  given for the use of final \"n\" is, that \"n\" is added to nouns and  pronouns (a) in the Accusative Case (the direct object), (b) when the  preposition is omitted. The explanation given above seems to me,  however, to be much simpler. (ii.). Another use of final \"n\" is given  later [Lesson 12, Lesson 26] ]    When the noun takes \"n\", any adjective which belongs to it must also  take \"n\", as, \"Li donas al mi belan rugxan floron\", He gives me a  beautiful red flower. \"Li donas al mi belajn rugxajn florojn\", He gives  me beautiful red flowers.

We have seen already (Lesson 1) that the words which end in \"-as\"  express the idea of \"doing\" (action) or of \"being\" (state), and that  they assert that this action or state is going on, or is a custom, at  the present time, as \"Mi vidas\", I see; \"Sxi estas\", She is; \"Ili  suferas\", They suffer, they are suffering.    To say that the action or state took place at some \"past\" time, \"-is\" is  used, as \"Mi vidis\", I saw; \"Sxi estis\", She was; \"Ili suferis\", They  suffered, they were suffering.    To say that the action or state will take place at some time to come, in  the future, \"-os\" is used, as, \"Mi vidos\", I shall see; \"Sxi estos\", She  will be; \"Ili suferos\", They will suffer, they will be suffering.    (Words which assert something, or which express the idea of doing or of  being, are called VERBS).    (The root only of the verbs will now be given in the Vocabulary without  the termination)."]]]
