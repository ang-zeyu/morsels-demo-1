They abound in  the South, and in Charleston are held in especial veneration for their  scavenger-like propensities, killing one of them being, I believe, a  fineable offence by the city police regulations. Among the Brobdignagian  sedges that in some parts of the island fringe the Altamaha, the  nightshade (apparently the same as the European creeper) weaves a perfect  matting of its poisonous garlands, and my remembrance of its prevalence in  the woods and hedges of England did not reconcile me to its appearance  here. How much of this is mere association I cannot tell; but whether the  wild duck makes its nest under its green arches, or the alligators and  snakes of the Altamaha have their secret bowers there, it is an  evil-looking weed, and I shall have every leaf of it cleared away.    I must inform you of a curious conversation which took place between my  little girl and the woman who performs for us the offices of chambermaid  here--of course one of Mr. ----'s slaves. What suggested it to the child,  or whence indeed she gathered her information, I know not; but children  are made of eyes and ears, and nothing, however minute, escapes their  microscopic observation. She suddenly began addressing this woman. 'Mary,  some persons are free and some are not (the woman made no reply). I am a  free person (of a little more than three years old). I say, I am a free  person, Mary--do you know that?' 'Yes, missis.' 'Some persons are free and  some are not--do you know that, Mary?' 'Yes, missis, _here_,' was the  reply; 'I know it is so here, in this world.' Here my child's white nurse,  my dear Margery, who had hitherto been silent, interfered, saying, 'Oh,  then you think it will not always be so?' 'Me hope not, missis.' I am  afraid, E----, this woman actually imagines that there will be no slaves  in Heaven; isn't that preposterous now? when by the account of most of the  Southerners slavery itself must be Heaven, or something uncommonly like  it. Oh, if you could imagine how this title 'Missis,' addressed to me and  to my children, shocks all my feelings! Several times I have exclaimed,  'For God's sake do not call me that!' and only been awakened, by the  stupid amazement of the poor creatures I was addressing, to the perfect  uselessness of my thus expostulating with them; once or twice indeed I  have done more--I have explained to them, and they appeared to comprehend  me well, that I had no ownership over them, for that I held such ownership  sinful, and that, though I was the wife of the man who pretends to own  them, I was in truth no more their mistress than they were mine. Some of  them I know understood me, more of them did not.    Our servants--those who have been selected to wait upon us in the  house--consist of a man, who is quite a tolerable cook (I believe this is  a natural gift with them, as with Frenchmen); a dairywoman, who churns for  us; a laundrywoman; her daughter, our housemaid, the aforesaid Mary; and  two young lads of from fifteen to twenty, who wait upon us in the capacity  of footmen. As, however, the latter are perfectly filthy in their persons  and clothes--their faces, hands, and naked feet being literally encrusted  with dirt--their attendance at our meals is not, as you may suppose,  particularly agreeable to me, and I dispense with it as often as possible.  Mary, too, is so intolerably offensive in her person that it is impossible  to endure her proximity, and the consequence is that, amongst Mr. ----'s  slaves, I wait upon myself more than I have ever done in my life before.  About this same personal offensiveness, the Southerners you know insist  that it is inherent with the race, and it is one of their most cogent  reasons for keeping them as slaves. But as this very disagreeable  peculiarity does not prevent Southern women from hanging their infants at  the breasts of negresses, nor almost every planter's wife and daughter  from having one or more little pet blacks sleeping like puppy dogs in  their very bedchamber, nor almost every planter from admitting one or  several of his female slaves to the still closer intimacy of his bed--it  seems to me that this objection to doing them right is not very valid. I  cannot imagine that they would smell much worse if they were free, or come  in much closer contact with the delicate organs of their white, fellow  countrymen; indeed, inasmuch as good deeds are spoken of as having a sweet  savour before God, it might be supposed that the freeing of the blacks  might prove rather an odoriferous process than the contrary. However this  may be, I must tell you that this potent reason for enslaving a whole race  of people is no more potent with me than most of the others adduced to  support the system, inasmuch as, from observation and some experience, I  am strongly inclined to believe that peculiar ignorance of the laws of  health and the habits of decent cleanliness are the real and only causes  of this disagreeable characteristic of the race--thorough ablutions and  change of linen, when tried, having been perfectly successful in removing  all such objections; and if ever you have come into anything like  neighbourly proximity with a low Irishman or woman, I think you will allow  that the same causes produce very nearly the same effects. The stench in  an Irish, Scotch, Italian, or French hovel are quite as intolerable as any  I ever found in our negro houses, and the filth and vermin which abound  about the clothes and persons of the lower peasantry of any of those  countries as abominable as the same conditions in the black population of  the United States. A total absence of self-respect begets these hateful  physical results, and in proportion as moral influences are remote,  physical evils will abound. Well-being, freedom, and industry induce  self-respect, self-respect induces cleanliness and personal attention, so  that slavery is answerable for all the evils that exhibit themselves where  it exists--from lying, thieving, and adultery, to dirty houses, ragged  clothes, and foul smells.    But to return to our Ganymedes. One of them--the eldest son of our  laundrywoman, and Mary's brother, a boy of the name of Aleck  (Alexander)--is uncommonly bright and intelligent; he performs all the  offices of a well-instructed waiter with great efficiency, and anywhere  out of slave land would be able to earn fourteen or fifteen dollars a  month for himself; he is remarkably good tempered and well disposed. The  other poor boy is so stupid that he appears sullen from absolute darkness  of intellect; instead of being a little lower than the angels, he is  scarcely a little higher than the brutes, and to this condition are  reduced the majority of his kind by the institutions under which they  live. I should tell you that Aleck's parents and kindred have always been  about the house of the overseer, and in daily habits of intercourse with  him and his wife; and wherever this is the case the effect of involuntary  education is evident in the improved intelligence of the degraded race.  In a conversation which Mr. ---- had this evening with Mr. O----, the  overseer, the latter mentioned that two of our carpenters had in their  leisure time made a boat, which they had disposed of to some neighbouring  planter for sixty dollars.    Now, E----, I have no intention of telling you a one-sided story, or  concealing from you what are cited as the advantages which these poor  people possess; you, who know that no indulgence is worth simple justice,  either to him who gives or him who receives, will not thence conclude that  their situation thus mitigated is, therefore, what it should be. On this  matter of the sixty dollars earned by Mr. ----'s two men much stress was  laid by him and his overseer. I look at it thus: if these men were  industrious enough out of their scanty leisure to earn sixty dollars, how  much more of remuneration, of comfort, of improvement might they not have  achieved were the price of their daily labour duly paid them, instead of  being unjustly withheld to support an idle young man and his idle  family--i.e. myself and my children.    And here it may be well to inform you that the slaves on this plantation  are divided into field hands and mechanics or artisans. The former, the  great majority, are the more stupid and brutish of the tribe; the others,  who are regularly taught their trades, are not only exceedingly expert at  them, but exhibit a greater general activity of intellect, which must  necessarily result from even a partial degree of cultivation. There are  here a gang (for that is the honourable term) of coopers, of blacksmiths,  of bricklayers, of carpenters--all well acquainted with their peculiar  trades. The latter constructed the wash-hand stands, clothes presses,  sofas, tables, &c, with which our house is furnished, and they are very  neat pieces of workmanship--neither veneered or polished indeed, nor of  very costly materials, but of the white pine wood planed as smooth as  marble--a species of furniture not very luxurious perhaps, but all the  better adapted therefore to the house itself, which is certainly rather  more devoid of the conveniences and adornments of modern existence than  anything I ever took up my abode in before. It consists of three small  rooms, and three still smaller, which would be more appropriately  designated as closets, a wooden recess by way of pantry, and a kitchen  detached from the dwelling--a mere wooden outhouse, with no floor but the  bare earth, and for furniture a congregation of filthy negroes, who lounge  in and out of it like hungry hounds at all hours of the day and night,  picking up such scraps of food as they can find about, which they discuss  squatting down upon their hams, in which interesting position and  occupation I generally find a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#4)"],[1,"ericans_,  131-135.]    25. Destruction of the Spanish Armada, 1588.--This activity of the  English in America was very distressing to the King of Spain. For he  claimed all America for himself and did not wish Englishmen to go  thither. He determined to conquer England and thus put an end to these  English voyages. But Hawkins, Drake, Ralegh, and the men behind the  English guns were too strong even for the Invincible Armada. Spain's  sea-power never recovered from this terrible blow. Englishmen could now  found colonies with slight fear of the Spaniards. When the Spanish king  learned of the settlement of Jamestown, he ordered an expedition to go  from St. Augustine to destroy the English colony. But the Spaniards  never got farther than the mouth of the James River. For when they  reached that point, they thought they saw the masts and spars of an  English ship. They at once turned about and sailed back to Florida as  fast as they could go.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS AND TOPICS      CHAPTER 1    Sec.Sec. 1-3.--a.

SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER    The teacher is recommended to study sources in preparing her work,  making selections where possible, for the pupil's use. Some knowledge of  European history (English especially) is essential for understanding our  early history, and definite work of this nature on the teacher's part,  at least, is earnestly advised.    Encourage outside reading by assigning subjects for individual  preparation, the results to be given to the class. Let the children keep  note books for entering the important points thus given.    Map study and map drawing should be constant, but demand correct  relations rather than finished drawings. Geographical environment should  be emphasized as well as the influence of natural resources and  productions in developing the country and in determining its history.    In laying out the work on this period the teacher should remember that  this part is in the nature of an introduction.

CHAPTER 4    FRENCH COLONISTS, MISSIONARIES, AND EXPLORERS    [Sidenote: Settlement of Acadia, 1604.]    [Sidenote: Port Royal.]    26. The French in Acadia.--For nearly forty years after the  destruction of the colony on the River of May, Frenchmen were too busy  fighting one another at home to send any more colonists to America. At  length, in 1604, a few Frenchmen settled on an island in the St. Croix  River. But the place was so cold and windy that after a few months they  crossed the Bay of Fundy and founded the town of Port Royal. The country  they called Acadia.

Champlain and his Work.--The most famous of these colonists was  Champlain. He sailed along the coast southward and westward as far as  Plymouth. As he passed by the mouth of Boston harbor, a mist hung low  over the water, and he did not see the entrance. Had it been clear he  would have discovered Boston harbor and Charles River, and French  colonists might have settled there. In 1608 Champlain built a  trading-post at Quebec and lived there for many years as governor or  chief trader. He soon joined the St. Lawrence Indians in their war  parties and explored large portions of the interior. In 1609 he went  with the Indians to a beautiful lake. Far away to the east were  mountains covered with snow. To the south were other mountains, but with  no snow on their tops. To the lake the explorer gave his own name, and  we still call it in his honor, Lake Champlain. While there, he drove  away with his firearms a body of Iroquois Indians. A few years later he  went with another war party to western New York and again attacked  the Iroquois.    [Sidenote: French missionaries and traders.]    [Sidenote: They visit Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.]    28. The French on the Great Lakes.--Champlain was the first of many  French discoverers. Some of these were missionaries who left home and  friends to bring the blessings of Christianity to the Red Men of the  western world. Others were fur-traders, while still others were men who  came to the wilderness in search of excitement. These French discoverers  found Lake Superior and Lake Michigan; they even reached the headwaters  of the Wisconsin River--a branch of the Mississippi.    [Sidenote: The Jesuits and their work.]    29. The French Missionaries.--The most active of the French  missionaries were the Jesuits. built stations on the shores of the Great  Lakes. They made long expeditions to unknown regions. Some of them were  killed by those whom they tried to convert to Christianity. Others were  robbed and left to starve. Others still were tortured and cruelly  abused. But the prospect of starvation, torture, and death only made  them more eager to carry on their great work.

Its importance.]    [Sidenote: The missionaries and the Iroquois.]    30. The Iroquois.--The strongest of all the Indian tribes were the  nations who formed the League of the Iroquois. Ever since Champlain  fired upon them they hated the sight of a Frenchman. On the other hand,  they looked upon the Dutch and the English as their friends. French  missionaries tried to convert them to Christianity as they had converted  the St. Lawrence Indians. But the Iroquois saw in this only another  attempt at French conquest. So they hung red-hot stones about the  missionaries' necks, or they burned them to death, or they cut them to  pieces while yet living. For a century and a half the Iroquois stood  between the Dutch and English settlers and their common enemies in  Canada. Few events, in American history, therefore, have had such great  consequences as Champlain's unprovoked attacks upon the Iroquois.          CHAPTER 5      VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND    [Sidenote: New conditions of living in England.]    [Sidenote: The Virginia Company.]    31. The Virginia Company, 1606.--English people were now beginning  to think in earnest of founding colonies. It was getting harder and  harder to earn one's living in England, and it was very difficult to  invest one's money in any useful way. It followed, from this, that there  were many men who were glad to become colonists, and many persons who  were glad to"]]]
