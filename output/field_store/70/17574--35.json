Already the pile of heaped-up fagots reached above the low roof of his  hut; but Carl Scheffler still continued lopping off branches, and  binding fresh bundles together, almost unconscious that the sun had set,  and that the labours of the day being over, the neighbouring peasants  were hastening to the skittle-ground to pass away an hour in sport. The  wood-cutter's hut was perched upon an eminence a little out of the  public path; but he heard the merry songs of his comrades as they  proceeded gaily to the place of rendezvous, at the Golden Stag in the  village below. Many of his intimate acquaintance paused as they  approached the corner of the road nearest to his hut, and the wild wood  rang with their loud halloes; but the call, which in other times had  been echoed by the woodman's glad voice, was now unanswered; he busied  himself with his work; his brow darkened as the joyous sounds came over  his ear; he threw aside his hatchet, resumed, it again, and again  casting it from him, exclaimed, \"Why, let them go, I will not carry this  chafed and wounded spirit to their revels; my hand is not steady enough  for a bowling-match; and since Linda will doubtless choose a richer  partner, I have no heart for the dance.\"    It was easy to perceive that Carl Scheffler was smarting under a recent  disappointment: he had borne up bravely against the misfortunes which,  from a state of comparative affluence, had reduced him to depend upon  his own arm for subsistence, fondly trusting that ere long his prospects  would amend; and that, at the return of the Count of Holberg to his  ancestorial dominions, he should obtain a forester's place, and be  enabled to claim the hand of Linda Von Kleist, to whom, in happier  times, he had been betrothed. But these dreams had vanished; the count's  bailiff having seen Linda, the flower of the hamlet, became his rival,  and consequently his enemy: he had bestowed the office promised to Carl  upon another; and Linda's father ungratefully withdrawing the consent  given when the lover's affairs were in a more flourishing condition, had  forbidden him the house. Buoyed up with the hope that Linda would remain  faithful, and by her unabated attachment console him under the pressure  of his calamities, Carl did not at first give way to despair; but Linda  was too obedient, or perchance too indifferent, to disobey her father's  commands. He sought her at the accustomed spot--she came not, sent not:  he hovered round her residence, and if chance favoured him with a  glimpse of his beloved, it was only to add to his misery, for she  withdrew hastily from his sight. A rumour of the intended marriage of  his perjured mistress reached his ears, and, struck to the soul, he  endeavoured, by manual labour, to exhaust his strength and banish the  recollection of his misery. He toiled all day in feverish desperation;  and now that there was no more to be done, sat down to ponder over his  altered prospects. The bailiff possessed the ear of his master, and it  was useless to hope that the count would repair the injustice committed  by so trusted a servant. The situation which above all others he had  coveted, which would have given him the free range of the forest, the  jovial hunter's life which suited his daring spirit, delighting in the  perils of the chase, and, above all, a home for Linda, was lost, and for  ever; henceforward he must relinquish all expectation of regaining the  station which the misfortunes that had brought his parents to the grave  had deprived him of, and be content to earn a sordid meal by bending his  back to burthens befitting the brute creation alone; to hew wood, and to  bear it to the neighbouring towns; to delve the ground at the bidding of  a master, and to perform the offices of a menial hireling. \"At least not  here,\" cried the wretched young man, \"not in the face of all my former  friends; there is a refuge left where I may hide my sorrows and my  wrongs. Fair earth, and thou fair sky, I gaze upon you for the last  time; buried from the face of day in the centre of the deepest mine,  I'll spend the remnant of my life unpitied and unknown.\" Determined to  execute this resolution on the instant, Carl hastily collected such  parts of his slender property as were portable; and having completed his  arrangements, prepared to cross the Brocken, and shaped his course  towards the Rammelsburg. The last rich gleam of crimson had faded from  the sky; but there was light enough in the summer night to guide him on  his way. A few bright and beautiful stars gemmed the wide concave of  heaven; the air was soft and balmy, scarcely agitating the leaves of the  forest trees; the fragrance-weeping limes gave out their richest scent,  and the gentle gush of fountains, and the tricklings of the mountain  springs, came in music on the ear; and had the traveller been more at  ease, the calm and tranquil scene must have diffused its soothing  influence over his heart. Carl, disregarding every thing save his own  melancholy destiny, strode along almost choked by bitter thought, and so  little heedful of the road, that he soon became involved in thickets  whose paths were unknown to him; he looked up to the heavens, and  shaping his course by one of the stars, was somewhat surprised to find  himself still involved in the impenetrable mazes of the wood. Compelled  to give more attention than heretofore to his route, he once or twice  thought that he distinguished a human figure moving through the darkness  of the forest. At first, not disposed to fall in with a companion, he  remained silent, lest the person, whoever he might be, should choose to  enter into conversation with him; then not quite certain whether he was  right in his conjecture--for upon casting a second glance upon the  object which attracted him, he more than once discovered it to be some  stunted trunk or fantastic tree--he became anxious to ascertain whether  he was in reality, alone, or if some other midnight wanderer trod the  waste, and he looked narrowly around; all was still, silent, and  solitary; and fancying that he had been deceived by the flitting shadows  of the night, he was again relapsing into his former reverie, when he  became aware of the presence of a man dressed in the garb of a forester,  and having his cap wreathed with a garland of green leaves, who stood  close at his side. Carl's tongue moved to utter a salutation, but the  words stuck in his throat, an indescribable sensation of horror thrilled  through his frame; tales of the demons of the Hartz rushed upon his  memory--but he recovered instantly from the sudden shock. The desperate  state of his fortune gave him courage, and, looking up, he was surprised  at the consternation which the stranger had occasioned: he was a person  of ordinary appearance, who, accosting him frankly, exclaimed, \"Ho,  comrade, thou art, I see, bent on the same errand as myself; but  wherefore dost thou seek the treasures of the Nibelungen without the  protecting wreath?\"--\"The treasures of the Nibelungen?\" returned Carl;  \"I have indeed heard of such a thing, and that it was hidden in the  bosom of the Hartz by a princess of the olden time; but I never was mad  enough to think of so wild a chase as a search after riches, which has  baffled the wisest of our ancestors, must surely prove.\"--\"Belike then,\"  replied the forester, \"thou art well to do in the world, and therefore  needest not to replenish thy wallets with gold,--travelling perchance to  take possession of some rich inheritance.\"--\"No, by St. Roelas,\" cried  the woodcutter, \"thou hast guessed wide of the mark. I am going to hide  my poverty in the mine of Rammelsburg.\"--\"The mine of Rammelsburg!\"  echoed the stranger, and laughed scornfully, so that the deep woods rang  with the sound; and Carl feeling his old sensations return as the  fiendish merriment resounded through the wilderness, again gazed  stedfastly in his companion's face, but he read nothing there to justify  his suspicions: the fiery eye lost its lustre; the lip its curl; and,  gazing benignantly upon the forlorn wood-cutter, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#4)"],[1,"de,\" when the latter  rushed into the room finning with rage.    \"I say,\" he exclaimed, \"what do you think that beast of a Noaks has  done?  Why, he's gone and put ashes all over our slide!\"    In their heart of hearts every one felt decidedly relieved at this  announcement; still it was necessary, at all events, to simulate some of  their leader's wrath, and accordingly there was a general outcry against  the offender.    \"Oh, the cad!\"--\"What an awful shame!\"--\"Let's tell Blake!\" etc., etc.    \"Who is Noaks?\" asked Diggory.  \"Is he that sour-looking man who brings  the boots in every morning?\"    \"Yes, that's so,\" answered Vance.  \"He hates us all--partly, I believe,  because his son's a Philistine.  I wonder old Welsby doesn't get another  man.\"    \"His son's a _what?_\" asked Diggory; but at that moment Acton came  marching round the room ordering every one out into the playground, and  Jack Vance hurried off to get his cap and muffler without replying to  the question.    Sliding was out of the question, and the \"House of Lords\" having amused  themselves for a time by capturing small boys and throwing them into the  snow-drift, some one remarked that it would be good fun to build a snow  man; which proposition was received with acclamation, and all hands were  soon hard at work rolling the big balls which were to form the base of  the statue.  As the work progressed the interest in it increased, the  more so when Diggory suggested that the figure should be supposed to  represent the obnoxious Noaks, and that the company could then relieve  their feelings by pelting his effigy as soon as it was completed.  Every one was pleased with the project, and even Acton, who as a rule  would never follow up any plan which was not of his own making, took  special pains to cause the snow man to bear some likeness to the  original.  He had just, by way of a finishing touch, expended nearly  half a penny bottle of red ink in a somewhat exaggerated reproduction of  the fiery hue of Noaks's nose, when the bell rang for afternoon school,  and the bombardment had to be postponed until the following day.    It was no small trial of patience being thus obliged to wait nearly  twenty-four hours before wreaking their vengeance on the effigy; still  there was no help for it.  The boys bottled down their feelings, and  when at last the classes were dismissed, and the dux cried, \"Come on,  you fellows!\" every one obeyed the summons willingly enough.  There had  been a slight thaw in the night, and the statue stood in need of some  trifling repairs.  Acton suggested, therefore, that the half-hour  before dinner should be devoted to putting things to rights, and to  making some small additions in the shape of pebbles for waistcoat  buttons, and other trifling adornments.    Mr. Welsby kept the boys at the table for nearly a quarter of an hour  after the meal was finished, talking over his plans for the coming term,  and when at last he finished there was a regular stampede for the  playground.  Acton was leading the rush; he dashed through the garden  doorway, and then stopped dead with an exclamation of dismay.  All those  who followed, as they arrived on the spot, did the same.  Every vestige  of the snow man, which had been left barely an hour ago standing such a  work of art, had disappeared.  Certainly a portion of the pedestal still  remained, looking like the stump of an old, decayed tooth; but the  figure itself had been thrown down, trodden flat, and literally stamped  out of existence!    The little crowd stood for a moment speechless, gazing with woebegone  expressions on their faces at the wreck of their hopes and handiwork;  then the silence was broken by a subdued chuckle coming from the other  side of the wall on their left, and every one, with a start and a sudden  clinching of fists, cried simultaneously: \"The Philistines!\"    The words had hardly been uttered when above the brickwork appeared the  head and shoulders of a boy a size or so bigger than Acton;  a dirty-looking brown bowler hat was stuck on the very back of his head,  and rammed down until the brim rested on the top of his ears; and it  will be quite sufficient to remark that his face was in exact keeping  with the manner in which he wore his hat.  Once more everybody gave vent  to their feelings by another involuntary ejaculation--\"Young Noaks!\"    The stranger laughed, pulled a face which, as far as ugliness went, was  hardly an improvement on the one Nature had already bestowed upon him,  and then pointed mockingly at the remains of the masterpiece.    His triumph, however, was short-lived.  Jack Vance, as he left the  house, had caught up a double handful of snow, which he had been  pressing into a hard ball as he ran down the path, determining in his  own, mind to be the first to open fire on the snow man.  Without a  moment's hesitation he flung the missile at the intruder's head, and, to  the intense delight of his companions, it struck the latter fairly on  the mouth, causing him to lose his precarious foothold on the wall and  fall back into the road.    It needed no further warning to inform the Birchites that the  Philistines were upon them, and every one set to work to lay in a stock  of snowballs as fast as hands could make them.  \"Look out!\" cried  Kennedy.  Young Noaks's face rose once more above the top of the wall,  and the next moment a big stone, the size of hen's egg, whizzed past  Diggory's head, and struck the garden door with a sounding bang.    \"Oh, the cad!\" cried Acton; \"let's go for him.\"    The whole garrison combined in making a vigorous sortie into the road;  but it was only to find the enemy in full retreat, and a few dropping  shots at long range ended the skirmish.    \"I say, Vance,\" exclaimed Diggory, \"who are they?  Who are these  fellows?\"    Now, as the aforesaid Philistines play rather an Important part in the  opening chapters of our story, I propose to answer the question myself,  in such a way that the reader may be enabled to take a more intelligent  interest in the chain of events which commenced with the destruction of  the snow man; and in order that this may be done in a satisfactory  manner, I will in a few words map out the ground on which this memorable  campaign was afterwards conducted.    Take the well-known drawing of two right angles In Euclid's definition,  and imagine the horizontal line to be the main road to Chatford, while  the perpendicular one standing on it is a  by-way called Locker's lane.  In the right angle stood The Birches; the house itself faced the  Chatford road, while behind it, in regular succession, came first the  sloping garden, then the walled-in playground, and then the small field  in which were attempted such games of cricket and football as the  limited number of pupils would permit.  There were three doors in the  playground--one the entrance from the garden, another opening into the  lane, and a third into the field, the two latter being usually kept  locked.    Locker's Lane was a short cut to Chatford, yet Rule 21 in The Birches  Statute-Book ordained that no boy should either go or return by this  route when visiting the town; the whole road was practically put out of  bounds, and the reason for this regulation was as follows:    At the corner of the playing field the lane took a sharp turn, and about  a quarter of a mile beyond this stood a large red-brick house, shut in  on three sides by a high wall, whereon, close to the heavy double doors  which formed the entrance, appeared a board bearing in big letters the  legend--                          HORACE HOUSE,                   Middle-Class School for Boys.                            A. PHILLIPS, B.A., Head-master.    The pupils of Mr. Phillips had been formerly called by Mr. Welsby's boys  the Phillipians, which title had in time given place to the present  nickname of the Philistines.    I have no doubt that the average boy turned out by Horace House was as  good a fellow, taking him all round, as the average boy produced by The  Birches; and that, if they had been thrown together in one school, they  would, for the most part, have made very good friends and comrades.  However, in fairness both to them and to their rivals, it must be said  that at the period of our story Mr. Phillips seemed for some time past  to have been unusually unfortunate in his elder boys: they were  undoubtedly \"cads,\" and the character of the whole establishment, as far  as the scholars were concerned, naturally yielded to the influence of  its leaders.    It had been customary every term for the Birchites to play a match  against them either at cricket or football; but their conduct during a  visit paid to the ground of the latter, back in the previous summer, had  been so very ungentlemanly and unsportsmanlike that, when the next  challenge arrived for an encounter at football, Mr. Welsby wrote back a  polite note expressing regret that he did not see his way clear to  permit a continuation of the matches.  This was the signal for an  outbreak of open hostilities between the two schools: the Philistines  charged the Birchites in the open street with being afraid to meet them  in the field.  These base insinuations led to frequent exchanges of  taunts and uncomplimentary remarks; and, last of all, matters were  brought to a climax by a stand-up fight between Tom Mason, Acton's  predecessor as dux, and young Noaks.  The encounter took place just  outside the stronghold of the enemy, the Birchite so far getting the  best of it that at the end of a five minutes' engagement he proclaimed  his victory by dragging his adversary along by the collar and bumping  his head a number of times against the very gates of Horace House.  Unfortunately a rumour of what had happened got to the ears of  Mr. Welsby.  Mason was severely reprimanded, and his companions were  forbidden, under pain of heavy punishment, to walk in Locker's Lane  further than the"]]]
