The following account of the _sepia media_, a small species of  cuttle-fish, is given by Mr. Donovan, in his \"Excursion through South  Wales:\"--\"When first caught, the eyes, which are large and prominent,  glistened with the lustre of the pearl, or rather of the emerald, whose  luminous transparency they seemed to emulate. The pupil is a fine black,  and above each eye is a semilunar mark of the richest garnet. The body,  nearly transparent, or of a pellucid green, is glossed with all the  variety of prismatic tints, and thickly dotted with brown. At almost  every effort of respiration, the little creature tossed its arms in  apparent agony, and clung more firmly to the finger; while the  dark-brown spots upon the body alternately faded and revived,  diminishing in size till they were scarcely perceptible, and then  appearing again as large as peas, crowding, and becoming confluent  nearly all over the body. At length, the animal being detained too long  from its native element, became enfeebled, the colours faded, the spots  decreased in size, and all its pristine beauty vanished with the last  gasp of life.\"    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *      THE OSTRICH.      The Ostriches in the Gardens of the Zoological Society would be truly a  noble pair, were it not for an unnatural curve in the neck of the male,  in consequence, it is said, of its having formerly swallowed something  more than usually bulky and hard of digestion.             *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.    [Illustration]      RUSSIAN BURIAL GROUND.      Mr. James's popular Journal of a Tour in Russia, &c., has supplied the  above illustration of honours paid to the dead in that country. The Cut  represents one of the Cemeteries of the government of Tchernigoff. Mr.  James describes it as planted around with trees, and studded thick with  wooden crosses, oratories, and other permanent marks of reverence. The  general appearance of piety with which these grounds are kept up, their  sequestered situation apart from any town, the profound veneration with  which they are saluted by the natives, added to the dark and sepulchral  shade of the groves, lend them an interest with which the tinsel  ornaments of more gorgeous cemeteries can in no degree compare.             *       *       *       *       *      ANCESTORS.      Some nations pay particular attention to the memory of their ancestors.  The Quojas, a people of Africa, offer sacrifices of rice and wine to  their ancestors, before they undertake any considerable action; and the  anniversaries of their death are always kept by their families with  great solemnity; the king invokes the souls of his father and mother to  make trade flourish and the chase succeed. But the Chinese have  distinguished themselves above all other nations, by the veneration in  which they hold their ancestors. Part of the duty, according to the laws  of Confucius, which children owe their parents, consists in worshipping  them when dead. They have a solemn and an ordinary worship for this  purpose, the former of which is held twice a year with great pomp, and  is described as follows by an eye witness:--The sacrifices were made in  a chapel, well adorned, where there were six altars, furnished with  censers, tapers, and flowers. There were three ministers, and behind  them two young acolites: he that officiated was an aged man, and a new  Christian. The three former went with a profound silence, and made  frequent genuflexions towards the five altars, pouring out wine;  afterwards they drew near to the sixth, and when they came to the foot  of the altar, half bowed down, they said their prayers with a low voice.  That being finished, the three ministers went to the altar; the priest  took up a vessel full of wine, and drank; then he lifted up the head of  a deer, or goat; after which, taking fire from the altar, they lighted a  bit of paper, and the minister of ceremonies turning towards the people,  said, with a high voice, that he gave them thanks in the name of their  ancestors, for having so well honoured them; and in recompense he  promised them, on their part, a plentiful harvest, a fruitful issue,  good health and long life, and all those advantages which are most  pleasing to men.    The Chinese have also in their houses a niche, or hollow place, in which  they put the names of their deceased fathers, to which they make prayers  and offerings of perfumes and spices at certain periods.    A.V.           *       *       *       *       *      THE SELECTOR;  AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.      HISTORY OF POLAND.      This volume, a goodly octavo, will be peculiarly acceptable at the  present season. It presents a lucid view of Polish history, from the  earliest period to the present eventful moment; and, as a passage of  immediate interest, we quote the following character of the President of  the National Government of Poland:        This illustrious personage, Prince Adam Czartoryski, is the      eldest son of the late prince of the same house, and is      descended from the family of Jagellon, the ancient sovereigns of      Lithuania. His father was long known, not only as a nobleman of      the first rank in Poland, but as one of the most accomplished      scholars in Europe. Such was his reputation, that at the period      of the last vacancy in the throne of Poland, Poniatowski      (afterwards king) was deputed by the diet to propitiate the      Empress Catherine, to second the election of Czartoryski; but      the deputy's handsome form found such favour in the licentious      eyes of the modern Messalina, that he ceased to urge the suit of      the diet, and returned the avowed nominee of his imperial      mistress. Prince Czartoryski's claims on the throne, popularity,      and consequent influence, rendered him odious to the court of      St. Petersburg, and when the last act of spoliation was      perpetrated, his lands were ravaged, his beautiful Castle of      Pulawy destroyed, and a sentence of extermination pronounced      against him, unless he would consent to send his two sons, one      the subject of this notice, and the other Prince Constantino      Czartoryski, as hostages to St. Petersburg. To avoid this      wretched alternative, the prince and his princess, who still      survive, consented to the separation, and the two young      noblemen, were placed under the eye of those who were deemed      worthy, by the Autocrat, of reforming their principles. The      talents displayed by both brothers soon obtained for them the      admiration of the court; and as it was of great importance to      gain them over, every mark of imperial favour was heaped upon      them by the Emperor Alexander, with whom, from infancy, they had      established terms of the utmost familiarity. The elder brother      held for a long time the portfolio of the Foreign Office, and,      in his official capacity, accompanied his imperial master to the      scenes of some of his most serious disasters. During Napoleon's      invasion, Prince Constantino was in Poland, and confiding in the      integrity of the then master of the destinies of Europe, and      breathing naught but freedom for his country, he joined the      banners of the invader, and raised a regiment at his own expense      to aid in the cause of liberation. At Smolensk he received a      severe wound, from the effects of which he has never yet      recovered. He resides at Vienna.        The influence of Prince Adam Czartoryski proved to be singularly      useful to Poland after the downfall of Napoleon. He interposed,      and interposed successfully, between the anger of Alexander and      his suffering country; and, on the establishment of the kingdom      of Poland, was appointed the curator of all the universities,      both there and in the incorporated provinces. These duties he      sedulously discharged, until he was superseded by the notorious      Count Novozilzoff. From this period he has lived in retirement,      faithfully performing all the duties of private life. The      promotion of agriculture, science in all its branches, and      kindly offices among mankind, constituted his occupations until      recent events drew him from his privacy. The first call was made      by the Russian functionaries, as stated in the text, for the      purpose of self-protection! the second was that of his devoted      country, when a government was essential to success. He was      chosen not only one of the five members of the executive body,      but its president, a station which he still honourably fills.      Into his new office he has carried all the unostentatious and      disinterested virtues that adorned Pulawy, and there is little      doubt that if (and no one suspects that such will not be the      case) the independence of Poland be fairly won, the choice of      his country will point to him as its sovereign. Having finished      his academical career at the University of Edinburgh, he early      acquired a strong taste for English institutions and for      Englishmen, and of this he gave substantial proof by devoting      250 l. a-year to the exclusive purchase of English books. His      revenues are enormous; but his liberality is unbounded; and, as      it is a rule in his munificent establishment to provide      liberally for the families of all his dependants, his means are      comparatively restricted, but his personal wants are few; and      that he is ready to accommodate himself to circumstances, was      well shown by his only observation on hearing of the      confiscation of his large property in Podolia by Nicholas.      \"Instead of riding, I must walk, and instead of sumptuous fare,      I must dine on buck-wheat.\"[3]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"a nest containing four slightly  incubated eggs. These birds, when the eggs are at all incubated, often  sit very close, especially if the nest is in an open situation, and in  many instances I have thrown several stones at the nest, and made as  much row as I could below without driving the old bird off, and I have  seen my nest-seeker within a few yards of the nest after climbing the  tree before the old bird flew off. On the 26th of April I found two  more nests, one containing four young birds just hatched, the other  three fresh eggs. On the 27th another nest containing three fresh  eggs, and on the 28th a nest of three fresh eggs. On the 5th May  two more nests containing four fresh and four incubated eggs  respectively.\"    \"In the Nilghiris,\" writes Mr. Davison, \"the Corby builds a coarse  nest of twigs, lined with cocoanut-fibre or dry grass high up in some  densely-foliaged tree. The eggs are usually four, often five, in  number. The birds lay in April and May.\"    Miss Cockburn again says:--\"They build like all Crows on large  trees merely by laying a few sticks together on some strong branch,  generally very high up in the tree. I do not remember ever seeing more  than one nest on a tree at a time, so that they differ very much from  the Rook in that respect. They lay four eggs of a bluish green,  with dusky blotches and spots, and nothing can exceed the care and  attention they bestow on their young. Even when the latter are able  to leave their nests and take long flights, the parent birds will  accompany them as if to prevent their getting into mischief. The nests  are found in April and May.\"    Mr. J. Darling, jun., writes from the Nilghiris:--\"I have found the  nest of this Crow pretty nearly all over the Nilghiris. The usual  number of eggs laid is four, but on one occasion, near the Quinine  Laboratory in the Government Gardens at Ooty, I procured six from one  nest. The breeding-season is from March to May, but I have taken eggs  as early as the 12th February.\"    From Ceylon, we hear from Mr. Layard that \"about the villages the  Carrion-Crow builds its nest in the cocoanut-trees. In the jungles  it selects a tall tree, amid the upper branches of which it fixes  a framework of sticks, and on this constructs a nest of twigs  and grasses. The eggs, from three to five, are usually of a dull  greenish-brown colour, thickly mottled with brown, these markings  being most prevalent at the small end. They are usually laid in  January and February.\"    Mr. J.E. Cripps informs us that in Eastern Bengal it is \"common and a  permanent resident. Occasionally found in the clumps of jungle that  are found about the country, which the next species never affects.  Breeds in the cold weather. I had noticed a pair building on a  Casuarina tree in my garden, about 50 feet off the ground, and on the  18th December, 1877, I took two perfectly fresh eggs from it; and  again on the 9th January, 1878, I found two callow young in this same  nest, the birds never having deserted it. The lining used for this  nest was principally jute-fibre--any tree is selected to build on; the  nests are placed from 15 to 50 feet off the ground. Some nests are  very well concealed, whereas others are quite exposed. On the 15th  January I found a nest about 15 feet up a small kudum tree, standing  in a large plain, and which had a lining of hair from the tail-tufts  of cows. There was one fresh egg, and a week later I got another fresh  egg from this very nest. From two to four eggs are in each nest.\"    Mr. Oates writes from Pegu:--\"These birds all begin to build about the  same time, and I have taken numerous nests at the end of January. At  the end of February most nests contain young birds.\"    Mr. W. Theobald gives the following notes on the nidification of this  bird in Tenasserim and near Deoghur:--    \"Lays in the third week of February and fourth week of March: eggs  ovato-pyriform; size 1.66 by 1.15; colour, dull sap-green much  blotched with brown; nest carefully placed in tall trees.\"    The eggs, though smaller, closely resemble, as might have been  expected, those of the Raven, but they are, I think, typically  somewhat broader and shorter. Almost every variety, as far as  coloration goes, to be found amongst those of the Raven, are found  amongst the eggs of the present species, and _vice versa_; and for a  description of these it is only necessary to refer to the account of  the former species; but I may notice that amongst the eggs of _C.  macrorhynchus_ I have not yet noticed any so boldly blotched as is  occasionally the case with some of the eggs of the Raven, which remind  one not a little, so far as the character of the markings go, of eggs  of _Oedicnemus crepitans_ and _Esacus recurvirostris_. Like those  of the Raven the eggs exhibit little gloss, though here and there  a fairly glossy egg is met with. Eggs from various parts of the  Himalayas, of the plains of Upper India, of the hills and plains of  Southern India, do not differ in any respect. _Inter se_ the eggs from  each locality differ surprisingly in size, in tone of colour, and in  character of markings; but when you compare a dozen or twenty from  each locality, you find that these differences are purely individual  and in no degree referable to locality.    There are just as big eggs and just as small ones from Simla and  Kotegurh, from Cashmere, from Etawah, Bareilly, Futtehgurh, from  Kotagherry, and Conoor; all that one can possibly say is that perhaps  the Plains birds do on the _average_ lay a _shade larger_ eggs than  the Himalayan or Nilghiri ones.    Taking the eggs as a whole, I think that in size and shape they are  about intermediate between the eggs of the European Carrion-Crow and  Rook. But they vary, as I said, astonishingly in size, from 1.5 to  1.95 in length, and in breadth from 1.12 to 1.22, and I have one  perfectly spherical egg, a deformity of course, which measures 1.25 by  1.2.    The average of thirty Himalayan eggs is 1.73 by 1.18, of twenty Plains  eggs 1.74 by 1.2, and of fifteen Nilghiri eggs 1.7 by 1.18. I would  venture to predict that with fifty of each, there would not be a  hundredth of an inch between their averages.      7. Corvus splendens, Vieill. _The Indian House-Crow_.    Corvus splendens, _Vieill. Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 298.  Corvus impudicus, _Hodgs., Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 663.    Throughout India and Upper Burma the Common Crow resides and breeds,  not ascending the hills either in Southern or Northern India to any  great elevation, but breeding up to 4000 feet in the Himalayas.    The breeding-season _par excellence_ is June and July, but occasional  nests will be found earlier even in Upper India, and in Southern and  Eastern India a great number lay in May. The nests are commonly placed  in trees without much regard to size or kind, though densely foliaged  ones are preferred, and I have just as often found several in the same  tree as single ones. At times they will build in nooks of ruins  or large deserted buildings, where these are in well inhabited  localities, but out of many thousands I have only seen three or four  nests in such abnormal positions.    The nest is placed in some fork, and is usually a ragged stick  platform, with a central depression lined with grass-roots; but they  are not particular as to material; I have found wool, rags, grass, and  all kinds of vegetable fibre, and Mr. Blyth mentions that he has \"seen  several nests composed more or less, and two almost exclusively, of  the wires taken from soda-water bottles, which had been purloined from  the heaps of these wires commonly set aside by the native servants  until they amount to a saleable quantity.\" Four is the normal number  of eggs laid, but I often have found five, and on two occasions six.  It is in this bird's nest that the Koel chiefly lays.    Writing of Nepal, Dr. Scully remarks:--\"In the valley it lays in May  and June; some twenty nests were once examined on the 23rd June, and  half the number then contained young birds.\"    Major Bingham says:--\"Very common, of course, both at Allahabad and at  Delhi, and breeds in June, July, and beginning of August. At Allahabad  it is much persecuted by the Koel (_Eudynamys orientalis_), every  fourth or fifth nest that I found in some topes of mango-trees having  one or two of the Koel's eggs.\"    Colonel Butler informs me that in Karachi it \"begins to lay in the  mangrove bushes in the harbour as early as the end of May;\" and that  it \"breeds in the neighbourhood of Deesa in June, July, and August,  commencing to build in the last week of May.\"    Later, he writes:--\"Belgaum, 15th May, 1879. Found numerous nests in  the native infantry lines in low trees, containing fresh and incubated  eggs and young birds of all sizes. In the same locality, on the 30th  March, 1880, I found a nest containing four young birds able to fly;  the eggs must therefore have been laid quite as early as the middle of  February, if not earlier.\"    Mr. G.W. Vidal writes:--\"The Common Crow appears to have two broods in  the year in our district (Ratnagiri), the first in April and May, and  the second in November and December. In these four months I have  found nests, eggs, and young birds in several different places in the  district, and as yet at no other times. It is extremely improbable  that there should be one breeding-season lasting from April to  December, and I think I may State with certainty that the Crows _do  not_ breed at Ratnagiri during the months of heaviest rainfall,  viz. July, August, and September. As their breeding in November and  December appears to be exceptional, I subjoin a record of the few  nests I examined.      \"Nov. 22, 1878.
