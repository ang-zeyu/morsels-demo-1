The world may have  inherited no advances in political science from the Hebrew, no great  epic, no school of architecture, no high lessons in philosophy, no wide  extension of human thought or knowledge in any secular direction; but he  has given it his religion. To other races we owe the splendid  inheritance of modern civilization and secular culture, but the  religious education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew alone.\"    For this end Abram was called to the land of Canaan. From this point of  view alone we see the blessing and the promise which were given to him.  In this light chiefly he became a great benefactor. He gave a religion  to the world; at least he established its fundamental principle,--the  worship of the only true God. \"If we were asked,\" says Max Mueller, \"how  it was that Abraham possessed not only the primitive conception of the  Divinity, as he has revealed himself to all mankind, but passed, through  the denial of all other gods, to the knowledge of the One God, we are  content to answer that it was by a _special divine revelation_.\" [1]    [Footnote 1: Chips from a German Workshop, vol. i. p. 372.]    If the greatness of the Jewish race was spiritual rather than temporal,  so the real greatness of Abraham was in his faith. Faith is a sentiment  or a principle not easily defined. But be it intuition, or induction, or  deduction,--supported by reason, or without reason,--whatever it is, we  know what it means.    The faith of Abraham, which Saint Paul so urgently commends, the same in  substance as his own faith in Jesus Christ, stands out in history as so  bright and perfect that it is represented as the foundation of religion  itself, without which it is impossible to please God, and with which one  is assured of divine favor, with its attendant blessings. If I were to  analyze it, I should say that it is a perfect trust in God, allied with  obedience to his commands.    With this sentiment as the supreme rule of life, Abraham is always  prepared to go wherever the way is indicated. He has no doubts, no  questionings, no scepticism. He simply adores the Lord Almighty, as the  object of his supreme worship, and is ready to obey His commands,  whether he can comprehend the reason of them or not. He needs no  arguments to confirm his trust or stimulate his obedience. And this is  faith,--an ultimate principle that no reasonings can shake or  strengthen. This faith, so sublime and elevated, needs no confirmation,  and is not made more intelligent by any definitions. If the _Cogito,  ergo sum_, is an elemental and ultimate principle of philosophy, so the  faith of Abraham is the fundamental basis of all religion, which is  weakened rather than strengthened by attempts to define it. All  definitions of an ultimate principle are vain, since everybody  understands what is meant by it.    No truly immortal man, no great benefactor, can go through life without  trials and temptations, either to test his faith or to establish his  integrity. Even Jesus Christ himself was subjected for forty days to  the snares of the Devil. Abram was no exception to this moral  discipline. He had two great trials to pass through before he could earn  the title of \"father of the faithful,\"--first, in reference to the  promise that he should have legitimate children; and secondly, in  reference to the sacrifice of Isaac.    As to the first, it seemed impossible that Abram should have issue  through his wife Sarah, she being ninety years of age, and he  ninety-nine or one hundred. The very idea of so strange a thing caused  Sarah to laugh incredulously, and it is recorded in the seventeenth  chapter of Genesis that Abram also fell on his face and laughed, saying  in his heart, \"Shall a son be born unto him that is one hundred years  old?\" Evidently he at first received the promise with some incredulity.  He could leave Ur of the Chaldees by divine command,--this was an act of  obedience; but he did not fully believe in what seemed to be against  natural law, which would be a sort of faith without evidence, blind,  against reason. He requires some sign from God. \"Whereby,\" said he,  \"shall I _know_ that I shall inherit it,\"--that is Canaan,--\"and that my  seed shall be in number as the stars of heaven?\" Then followed the  renewal of the covenant; and, according to the frequent custom of the  times, when covenants were made between individual men, Abram took a new  name: \"And God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold my covenant  is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall  thy name be any more Abram [Father of Elevation] but thy name shall be  Abraham [Father of a Multitude], for a father of many nations have I  made thee.\" We observe that the covenant was repeatedly renewed; in  connection with which was the rite of circumcision, which Abraham and  his posterity, and even his servants, were required scrupulously to  observe, and which it would appear he unreluctantly did observe as an  important condition of the covenant. Why this rite was so imperatively  commanded we do not know, neither can we understand why it was so  indissolubly connected with the covenant between God and Abraham. We  only know that it was piously kept, not only by Abraham himself, but by  his descendants from generation to generation, and became one of the  distinctive marks and peculiarities of the Jewish nation,--the sign of  the promise that in Abraham all the families of the earth should be  blessed,--a promise fulfilled even in the patriarchal monotheism of  Arabia, the distant tribes of which, under Mohammed, accepted the One  Supreme God.    A still more serious test of the faith of Abraham was the sacrifice of  Isaac, on whose life all his hopes naturally rested. We are told that  God \"tempted,\" or tested, the obedient faith of Abraham, by suggesting  to him that it was his duty to sacrifice that only son as a  burnt-offering, to prove how utterly he trusted the Lord's promise; for  if Isaac were cut off, where was another legitimate heir to be found?  Abraham was then one hundred and twenty years old, and his wife was one  hundred and ten. Moreover, on principles of reason why should such a  sacrifice be demanded? It was not only apparently against reason, but  against nature, against every sacred instinct, against humanity, even an  act of cruelty,--yea, more, a crime, since it was homicide, without any  seeming necessity. Besides, everybody has a right to his own life,  unless he has forfeited it by crime against society. Isaac was a gentle,  harmless, interesting youth of twenty, and what right, by any human  standard, had Abraham to take his life? It is true that by patriarchal  customs and laws Isaac belonged to Abraham as much as if he were a slave  or an animal. He had the Oriental right to do with his son as he  pleased. The head of a family had not only absolute control over wife  and children, but the power of life and death. And this absolute power  was not exercised alone by Semitic races, but also by the Aryan in their  original settlements, in Greece and Italy, as well as in Northern India.  All the early institutions of society recognized this paternal right.  Hence the moral sense of Abraham was not apparently shocked at the  command of God, since his son was his absolute property. Even Isaac  made no resistance, since he knew that Abraham had a right to his life.    Moreover, we should remember that sacrifices to all objects of worship  formed the basis of all the religious rites of the ancient world, in all  periods of its history. Human sacrifices were offered in India at the  very period when Abraham was a wanderer in Palestine; and though human  nature ultimately revolted from this cruelty, the sacrifice of  substitute-animals continued from generation to generation as oblations  to the gods, and is still continued by Brahminical priests. In China, in  Egypt, in Assyria, in Greece, no religious rites were perfected without  sacrifices. Even in the Mosaic ritual, sacrifices by the priests formed  no inconsiderable part of worship. Not until the time of Isaiah was it  said that God took no delight in burnt offerings,--that the real  sacrifices which He requires are a broken and a contrite heart. Nor were  the Jews finally emancipated from sacrificial rites until Christ himself  made his own body an offering for the sins of the world, and in God's  providence the Romans destroyed their temple and scattered their nation.  In antiquity there was no objective worship of the Deity without  sacrificial rites, and when these were omitted or despised there was  atheism,--as in the case of Buddha, who taught morals rather than  religion. Perhaps the oldest and most prevalent religious idea of  antiquity was the necessity of propitiatory sacrifice,--generally of  animals, though in remotest ages the offering of the fruits of  the earth.[2]    [Footnote 2: Dr. Trumbull has made a learned and ingenious argument in  his \"Blood Covenant\" to show that sacrifices were not to propitiate the  deity, but to bring about a closer Spiritual union between the soul and  God; that the blood covenant was a covenant of friendship and love among  all primitive peoples.]    The inquiry might here arise, whether in our times anything would  justify a man in committing a homicide on an innocent person. Would he  not be called a fanatic? If so, we may infer that morality--the proper  conduct of men as regards one another in social relations--is better  understood among us than it was among the patriarchs four thousand years  ago; and hence, that as nations advance in civilization they have a more  enlightened sense of duty, and practically a higher morality.

He is largely respected; he would have  been more respected if he had been less exacting towards Dissenters,  and less violent in his hatred of Catholics. Neither his Church-rate  nor Easter Due escapade improved his position; and some of his  fierce anti-Popery denunciations did not increase his circle of  friends. But these things have gone by, and let them be forgotten.  In private life Canon Parr is essentially social:  he can tell a  good tale, is full of humour; he knows a few things as well as the  rest of men, and is charitably disposed--indeed he is too  sympathetic and this causes hint to be pestered with rubbishy tales  from all sorts of individuals, and sometimes to act upon them as if  they were true. As a Protestant vicar--and, remembering that no  angels have yet been born in this country, that everybody is  somewhat imperfect, and that folk will differ--we look upon Canon  Parr as above the average. He has said extravagant and unreasonable  things in his time; but he has rare properties, qualities of sense  and erudition, which are strangers to many pretentious men in his  line of business; and, on the whole, he may be legitimately set  down, in the language of the \"gods,\" as \"O.K.\"        No. II.        ST. WILFRID'S CATHOLIC CHURCH.        It was at one time of the day a rather dangerous sort of thing for a  man, or a woman, or a medium-sized infant, living in this highly-  favoured land of ours, to show any special liking for Roman  Catholicism. But the days of religious bruising have perished; and  Catholics are now, in the main, considered to be human as well as  other people, and to have a right to live, and put their Sunday  clothes on, and go to their own places of worship like the rest of  mortals. No doubt there are a few distempered adherents of the  \"immortal William\" school who would like to see Catholics driven  into a corner, banished, or squeezed into nothing; probably there  are some of the highly sublimated \"no surrender\" gentlemen who would  be considerably pleased if they could galvanise the old penal code  and put a barrel able to play the air of \"Boyne Water\" into every  street organ; but the great mass of men have learned to be tolerant,  and have come to the conclusion that Catholics, civilly and  religiously, are entitled to all the liberty which a free and  enlightened constitution can confer--to all the privileges which  fair-play and even-handed justice call give; and if these are not  fully granted now, the day is coming when they will be possessed.  Lancashire seems to be the great centre of Catholicism in England,  and Preston appears to be its centre in Lancashire. This benign town  of Preston, with its fervent galaxy of lecturing curates, and its  noble army of high falutin' incumbents, is the very fulcrum and  lever of northern Romanism. If Catholics are wrong and on the way to  perdition and blisters there are 33,000 of them here moving in that  very awkward direction at the present. A number so large, whether  right or wrong cannot he despised; a body so great, whether good or  evil, will, by its sheer inherent force, persist in living, moving,  and having, a fair share of being. You can't evaporate 33,000 of  anything in a hurry; and you could no more put a nightcap upon the  Catholics of Preston than you could blacken up the eye of the sun.  That stout old Vatican gentleman who storms this fast world of ours  periodically with his encyclicals, and who is known by the name of  Pius IX., must, if he knows anything of England, know something of  Preston; and if he knows anything of it he will have long since  learned that wherever the faith over which he presides may be going  down the hill, it is at least in Preston \"as well as can be  expected,\" and likely, for a period longer than be will live, to  bloom and flourish.    Our text is--St. Wilfrid's Catholic Church, Preston. This place of  worship is situated in a somewhat sanctified place--Chapel-street;  but as about half of that locality is taken up with lawyers'  offices, and the centre of it by a police station, we fancy that  this world, rather than the next, will occupy the bulk of its  attention. It is to be hoped that St. Wilfrid's, which stands on the  opposite side, will act as a healthy counterpoise--will, at any  rate, maintain its own against such formidable odds. The building in  Chapel-street, dedicated to the old Angle-Saxon bishop--St. Wilfrid-  -who was a combative sort of soul, fond of argumentatively knocking  down obstreperous kings and ecclesiastics and breaking up the  strongholds of paganism--was opened seventy-six years ago. It  signifies little how it looked then. Today it has a large  appearance. There is nothing worth either laughing or crying about  so far as its exterior goes. It doesn't look like a church; it  resembles not a chapel; and it seems too big for a house. There is  no effort at architectural elaboration in its outer arrangements. It  is plain, strong, large; and like big feet or leathern shirts has  evidently been made more for use than ornament. But this style of  phraseology only refers to the extrinsic part. Inside, the church  has a vast, ornate, and magnificent appearance. No place of worship  in Preston is so finely decorated, so skilfully painted, so  artistically got up. In the world of business there is nothing like  leather; in the arena of religion there seems to be nothing like  paint. Every church in the country makes an effort to get deeply  into the region of paint; they will have it upon either windows,  walls, or ceilings. It is true that Dissenters do not dive  profoundly into the coloured abyss; but weakness of funds combined  with defective aesthetic cultivation may have something to do with  their deficiency in this respect. Those who have had the management  and support of St. Wilfrid's in their hands, have studied the theory  of colour to perfection, and whilst we may not theologically agree  with some of its uses, one cannot but admire its general effect.  Saints, angels, rings, squares, floriations, spiralizations, and  everything which the brain or the brush of the most devoted painter  could fairly devise are depicted in this church, and there is such  an array of them that one wonders how anybody could ever have had  the time or patience to finish the work.    The high altar which occupies the southern end is, in its way,  something very fine. A magnificent picture of the crucifixion  occupies the back ground; flowers and candles, in numbers sufficient  to appal the stoutest Evangelical and turn to blue ruin such men as  the editor of the \"Bulwark\" are elevated in front; over all, as well  as collaterally, there are inscriptions in Latin; designs in gold  and azure and vermilion fill up the details; and on each side there  is a confessional wherein all members, whether large or diminutive,  whether dressed in corduroy or smoothest, blackest broad cloth, in  silk or Surat cotton, must unravel the sins they have committed.  This confession must be a hard sort of job, we know, for some  people; but we are not going to enter upon a discussion of its  merits or demerits. Only this may be said, that if there was full  confession at every place of worship in Preston the parsons would  never get through their work. Every day, from an early hour in the  morning until a late period of the evening, St. Wilfrid's is open to  worshippers; and you may see them, some with smiling faces, and some  with very elongated ones, going to or coming from it constantly.  Like Tennyson's stream, they evince symptoms of constant movement  and the only conclusion we can fairly come to is that the mass of  them are singularly in earnest. There are not many Protestants--  neither Church people, nor Dissenters, neither quiescent Quakers nor  Revivalist dervishes--who would be inclined to go to their religious  exercises before breakfast, and if they did, some of them, like the  old woman who partook of Sacrament in Minnesota, would want to know  what they were going to \"get\" for it. On Sundays, as on week days,  the same business--laborious as it looks to outsiders--goes on.  There are several services, and they are arranged for every class--  for those who must attend early, for those who can't, for those who  won't, and for those who stir when the afflatus is upon them. There  are many, however, who are regular attendants, soon and late, and if  precision and continuity will assist them in getting to heaven, they  possess those auxiliaries in abundance.    The congregation attending on a Sunday is a mixed one--rags and  satins, moleskins and patent kids, are all duly represented; and it  is quite a study to see their wearers put in an appearance. Directly  after entrance reverential genuflections and holy-water dipping are  indulged in. Some of the congregation do the business gracefully;  others get through it like the very grandfather of awkwardness. The  Irish, who often come first and sit last, are solemnly whimsical in  their movements. The women dip fast and curtsy briskly; the men turn  their hands in and out as if prehensile mysticism was a saving  thing, and bow less rapidly but more angularly than the females;  then you have the slender young lady who knows what deportment and  reverence mean; who dips quietly, and makes a partial descent  gracefully; the servant girl who goes through the preliminary  somewhat roughly but very earnestly; the smart young fellow, who  dips with his gloves on--a \"rather lazy kind of thing,\" as the  cobbler remarked when he said his prayers in bed--and gives a sort  of half and half nod, as if the whole bend were below his dignity;  the business man, who goes into the water and the bowing in a  matter-of-fact style, who gets through the ceremony soon but well,  and moves on for the next comer; the youth, who touches the water in  a come-and-go style, and makes a bow on a "]]]
