They had heard Buck's talk earlier in  the day, and they growled as they saw him turn tail.    Two moments more and Buck would have been on his horse, but in those two  moments luck took a hand. Around the corner came Andrew Lanning with his  head bowed in thought. At once a roar went up from every throat in the  saloon: \"There's your man. Go to him!\"    Buck Heath turned from his horse; Andrew lifted his head. They were face  to face, and it was hard to tell to which one of them the other was the  least welcome. But Andrew spoke first. A thick silence had fallen in the  saloon. Most of the onlookers wore careless smiles, for the caliber of  these two was known, and no one expected violence; but Jasper Lanning,  at the door, stood with a sick face. He was praying in the silence.    Every one could hear Andrew say: \"I hear you've been making a talk about  me, Buck?\"    It was a fair enough opening. The blood ran more freely in the veins of  Jasper. Perhaps the quiet of his boy had not been altogether the quiet  of cowardice.    \"Aw,\" answered Buck Heath, \"don't you be takin' everything you hear for  gospel. What kind of talk do you mean?\"    \"He's layin' down,\" said Bill Dozier, and his voice was soft but audible  in the saloon. \"The skunk!\"    \"I was about to say,\" said Andrew, \"that I think you had no cause for  talk. I've done you no harm, Buck.\"    The hush in the saloon became thicker; eyes of pity turned on that  proved man, Jasper Lanning. He had bowed his head. And the words of the  younger man had an instant effect on Buck Heath. They seemed to  infuriate him.    \"You've done me no harm?\" he echoed. He let his voice out; he even  glanced back and took pleasurable note of the crowded faces behind the  dim windows of the saloon. Just then Geary, the saloon keeper, lighted  one of the big lamps, and at once all the faces at the windows became  black silhouettes. \"You done me no harm?\" repeated Buck Heath. \"Ain't  you been goin' about makin' a talk that you was after me? Well, son,  here I am. Now let's see you eat!\"    \"I've said nothing about you,\" declared Andy. There was a groan from the  saloon. Once more all eyes flashed across to Jasper Lanning.    \"Bah!\" snorted Buck Heath, and raised his hand. To crown the horror, the  other stepped back. A little puff of alkali dust attested the movement.    \"I'll tell you,\" roared Buck, \"you ain't fittin' for a man's hand to  touch, you ain't. A hosswhip is more your style.\"    From the pommel of his saddle he snatched his quirt. It whirled, hummed  in the air, and then cracked on the shoulders of Andrew. In the dimness  of the saloon door a gun flashed in the hand of Jasper Lanning. It was a  swift draw, but he was not in time to shoot, for Andy, with a cry,  ducked in under the whip as it raised for the second blow and grappled  with Buck Heath. They swayed, then separated as though they had been  torn apart. But the instant of contact had told Andy a hundred things.  He was much smaller than the other, but he knew that he was far and away  stronger after that grapple. It cleared his brain, and his nerves  ceased jumping.    \"Keep off,\" he said. \"I've no wish to harm you.\"    \"You houn' dog!\" yelled Buck, and leaped in with a driving fist.    It bounced off the shoulder of Andrew. At the same time he saw those  banked heads at the windows of the saloon, and knew it was a trap for  him. All the scorn and the grief which had been piling up in him, all  the cold hurt went into the effort as he stepped in and snapped his fist  into the face of Buck Heath. He rose with the blow; all his energy, from  wrist to instep, was in that lifting drive. Then there was a jarring  impact that made his arm numb to the shoulder. Buck Heath looked blankly  at him, wavered, and pitched loosely forward on his face. And his head  bounced back as it struck the ground. It was a horrible thing to see,  but it brought one wild yell of joy from the saloon--the voice of  Jasper Lanning.    Andrew had dropped to his knees and turned the body upon its back. The  stone had been half buried in the dust, but it had cut a deep, ragged  gash on the forehead of Buck. His eyes were open, glazed; his mouth  sagged; and as the first panic seized Andy he fumbled at the heart of  the senseless man and felt no beat.    \"Dead!\" exclaimed Andy, starting to his feet. Men were running toward  him from the saloon, and their eagerness made him see a picture he had  once seen before. A man standing in the middle of a courtroom; the place  crowded; the judge speaking from behind the desk: \"--to be hanged by the  neck until--\"    A revolver came into the hand of Andrew. And when he found his voice,  there was a snapping tension in it.    \"Stop!\" he called. The scattering line stopped like horses thrown back  on their haunches by jerked bridle reins. \"And don't make no move,\"  continued Andy, gathering the reins of Buck's horse behind him. A  blanket of silence had dropped on the street.    \"The first gent that shows metal,\" said Andy, \"I'll drill him. Keep  steady!\"    He turned and flashed into the saddle. Once more his gun covered them.  He found his mind working swiftly, calmly. His knees pressed the long  holster of an old-fashioned rifle. He knew that make of gun from toe to  foresight; he could assemble it in the dark.    \"You, Perkins! Get your hands away from your hip. Higher, blast you!\"    He was obeyed. His voice was thin, but it kept that line of hands high  above their heads. When he moved his gun the whole line winced; it was  as if his will were communicated to them on electric currents. He sent  his horse into a walk; into a trot; then dropped along the saddle, and  was plunging at full speed down the street, leaving a trail of sharp  alkali dust behind him and a long, tingling yell.          CHAPTER 4      Only one man in the crowd was old enough to recognize that yell, and the  one man was Jasper Lanning. A great, singing happiness filled his heart  and his throat. But the shouting of the men as they tumbled into their  saddles cleared his brain. He called to Deputy Bill Dozier, who was  kneeling beside the prostrate form of Buck Heath: \"Call 'em off, Bill.  Call 'em off, or, by the Lord, I'll take a hand in this! He done it in  self-defense. He didn't even pull a gun on Buck. Bill, call 'em off!\"    And Bill did it most effectually. He straightened, and then got up.  \"Some of you fools get some sense, will you?\" he called. \"Buck ain't  dead; he's just knocked out!\"    It brought them back, a shamefaced crew, laughing at each other.  \"Where's a doctor?\" demanded Bill Dozier.    Someone who had an inkling of how wounds should be cared for was  instantly at work over Buck. \"He's not dead,\" pronounced this authority,  \"but he's danged close to it. Fractured skull, that's what he's got.  And a fractured jaw, too, looks to me. Yep, you can hear the  bone grate!\"    Jasper Lanning was in the midst of a joyous monologue. \"You seen it,  boys? One punch done it. That's what the Lannings are--the one-punch  kind. And you seen him get to his gun? Handy! Lord, but it done me good  to see him mosey that piece of iron off'n his hip. And see him take that  saddle? Where was you with your gal, Joe? Nowhere! Looked to me like--\"    The voice of Bill Dozier broke in: \"I want a posse. Who'll ride with  Bill Dozier tonight?\"    It sobered Jasper Lanning. \"What d'you mean by that?\" he asked. \"Didn't  the boy fight clean?\"    \"Maybe,\" admitted Dozier. \"But Buck may kick out. And if he dies they's  got to be a judge talk to your boy. Come on. I want volunteers.\"    \"Dozier, what's all this fool talk?\"    \"Don't bother me, Lanning. I got a duty to perform, ain't I? Think I'm  going to let 'em say later on that anybody done this and then got away  from Bill Dozier? Not me!\"    \"Bill,\" said Jasper, \"I read in your mind. You're lookin' for action,  and you want to get it out of Andy.\"    \"I want nothin' but to get him back.\"    \"Think he'll let you come close enough to talk? He'll think you want him  for murder, that's what. Keep off of this boy, Bill. Let him hear the  news; then he'll come back well enough.\"    \"You waste my time,\" said Bill, \"and all the while a man that the law  wants is puttin' ground between him and Martindale. Now, boys, you hear  me talk. Who's with Bill Dozier to bring back this milk-fed kid?\"    It brought a snarl from Jasper Lanning. \"Why don't you go after him by  yourself, Dozier? I had your job once and I didn't ask no helpers  on it.\"    But Bill Dozier apparently had no liking for a lonely ride. He made his  demand once more, and the volunteers came out. In five minutes he had  selected five sturdy men, and every one of the five was a man whose name  was known.    They went down the street of Martindale without shouting and at a steady  lope which their horses could keep up indefinitely. Old Jasper followed  them to the end of the village and kept on watching through the dusk  until the six horsemen loomed on the hill beyond against the sky line.  They were still cantering, and they rode close together like a tireless  pack of wolves. After this old Jasper went back to his house, and when  the door closed behind him a lonely echo went through the place.    \"Bah!\" said Jasper. \"I'm getting soft!\"    In the meantime the posse went on, regardless of direction. There were  only two possible paths for a horseman out of Martindale; east and west  the mountains blocked the way, and young Lanning had started north.  Straight ahead of them the mountains shot up on either side of Grant's  Pass, and toward this natural landmark Bill Dozier led the way. Not that  he expected to have to travel as far as this. He felt fairly certain  that the fugitive would ride out his horse at full speed, and then he  would camp for the night and make a fire.    Andrew Lanning was town bred and soft of skin from the work at the  forge. When the biting night"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],[0,"Nightmare Abbey (#3)"],[1,"and published a treatise, in which his meanings were carefully wrapt  up in the monk's hood of transcendental technology, but filled with  hints of matter deep and dangerous, which he thought would set  the whole nation in a ferment; and he awaited the result in awful  expectation, as a miner who has fired a train awaits the explosion of  a rock. However, he listened and heard nothing; for the explosion, if  any ensued, was not sufficiently loud to shake a single leaf of the  ivy on the towers of Nightmare Abbey; and some months afterwards he  received a letter from his bookseller, informing him that only seven  copies had been sold, and concluding with a polite request for the  balance.    Scythrop did not despair. 'Seven copies,' he thought, 'have been sold.  Seven is a mystical number, and the omen is good. Let me find the  seven purchasers of my seven copies, and they shall be the seven  golden candle-sticks with which I will illuminate the world.'    Scythrop had a certain portion of mechanical genius, which his  romantic projects tended to develope. He constructed models of cells  and recesses, sliding panels and secret passages, that would have  baffled the skill of the Parisian police. He took the opportunity of  his father's absence to smuggle a dumb carpenter into the Abbey, and  between them they gave reality to one of these models in Scythrop's  tower. Scythrop foresaw that a great leader of human regeneration  would be involved in fearful dilemmas, and determined, for the benefit  of mankind in general, to adopt all possible precautions for the  preservation of himself.    The servants, even the women, had been tutored into silence. Profound  stillness reigned throughout and around the Abbey, except when the  occasional shutting of a door would peal in long reverberations  through the galleries, or the heavy tread of the pensive butler would  wake the hollow echoes of the hall. Scythrop stalked about like the  grand inquisitor, and the servants flitted past him like familiars. In  his evening meditations on the terrace, under the ivy of the ruined  tower, the only sounds that came to his ear were the rustling of the  wind in the ivy, the plaintive voices of the feathered choristers, the  owls, the occasional striking of the Abbey clock, and the monotonous  dash of the sea on its low and level shore. In the mean time, he drank  Madeira, and laid deep schemes for a thorough repair of the crazy  fabric of human nature.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III      Mr Glowry returned from London with the loss of his lawsuit. Justice  was with him, but the law was against him. He found Scythrop in a  mood most sympathetically tragic; and they vied with each other in  enlivening their cups by lamenting the depravity of this degenerate  age, and occasionally interspersing divers grim jokes about graves,  worms, and epitaphs. Mr Glowry's friends, whom we have mentioned in  the first chapter, availed themselves of his return to pay him a  simultaneous visit. At the same time arrived Scythrop's friend and  fellow-collegian, the Honourable Mr Listless. Mr Glowry had discovered  this fashionable young gentleman in London, 'stretched on the rack of  a too easy chair,' and devoured with a gloomy and misanthropical _nil  curo_, and had pressed him so earnestly to take the benefit of the  pure country air, at Nightmare Abbey, that Mr Listless, finding it  would give him more trouble to refuse than to comply, summoned his  French valet, Fatout, and told him he was going to Lincolnshire. On  this simple hint, Fatout went to work, and the imperials were packed,  and the post-chariot was at the door, without the Honourable Mr  Listless having said or thought another syllable on the subject.    Mr and Mrs Hilary brought with them an orphan niece, a daughter of Mr  Glowry's youngest sister, who had made a runaway love-match with an  Irish officer. The lady's fortune disappeared in the first year: love,  by a natural consequence, disappeared in the second: the Irishman  himself, by a still more natural consequence, disappeared in the  third. Mr Glowry had allowed his sister an annuity, and she had lived  in retirement with her only daughter, whom, at her death, which had  recently happened, she commended to the care of Mrs Hilary.    Miss Marionetta Celestina O'Carroll was a very blooming and  accomplished young lady. Being a compound of the _Allegro Vivace_ of  the O'Carrolls, and of the _Andante Doloroso_ of the Glowries, she  exhibited in her own character all the diversities of an April sky.  Her hair was light-brown; her eyes hazel, and sparkling with a mild  but fluctuating light; her features regular; her lips full, and of  equal size; and her person surpassingly graceful. She was a proficient  in music. Her conversation was sprightly, but always on subjects light  in their nature and limited in their interest: for moral sympathies,  in any general sense, had no place in her mind. She had some coquetry,  and more caprice, liking and disliking almost in the same moment;  pursuing an object with earnestness while it seemed unattainable, and  rejecting it when in her power as not worth the trouble of possession.    Whether she was touched with a _penchant_ for her cousin Scythrop, or  was merely curious to see what effect the tender passion would have on  so _outre_ a person, she had not been three days in the Abbey before  she threw out all the lures of her beauty and accomplishments to make  a prize of his heart. Scythrop proved an easy conquest. The image of  Miss Emily Girouette was already sufficiently dimmed by the power of  philosophy and the exercise of reason: for to these influences, or to  any influence but the true one, are usually ascribed the mental cures  performed by the great physician Time. Scythrop's romantic dreams had  indeed given him many _pure anticipated cognitions_ of combinations  of beauty and intelligence, which, he had some misgivings, were not  exactly realised in his cousin Marionetta; but, in spite of these  misgivings, he soon became distractedly in love; which, when the young  lady clearly perceived, she altered her tactics, and assumed as much  coldness and reserve as she had before shown ardent and ingenuous  attachment. Scythrop was confounded at the sudden change; but, instead  of falling at her feet and requesting an explanation, he retreated  to his tower, muffled himself in his nightcap, seated himself in  the president's chair of his imaginary secret tribunal, summoned  Marionetta with all terrible formalities, frightened her out of her  wits, disclosed himself, and clasped the beautiful penitent to his  bosom.    While he was acting this reverie--in the moment in which the awful  president of the secret tribunal was throwing back his cowl and his  mantle, and discovering himself to the lovely culprit as her adoring  and magnanimous lover, the door of the study opened, and the real  Marionetta appeared.    The motives which had led her to the tower were a little penitence, a  little concern, a little affection, and a little fear as to what the  sudden secession of Scythrop, occasioned by her sudden change of  manner, might portend. She had tapped several times unheard, and of  course unanswered; and at length, timidly and cautiously opening the  door, she discovered him standing up before a black velvet chair,  which was mounted on an old oak table, in the act of throwing open his  striped calico dressing-gown, and flinging away his nightcap--which is  what the French call an imposing attitude.    Each stood a few moments fixed in their respective places--the lady in  astonishment, and the gentleman in confusion. Marionetta was the first  to break silence. 'For heaven's sake,' said she, 'my dear Scythrop,  what is the matter?'    'For heaven's sake, indeed!' said Scythrop, springing from the table;  'for your sake, Marionetta, and you are my heaven,--distraction is the  matter. I adore you, Marionetta, and your cruelty drives me mad.'  He threw himself at her knees, devoured her hand with kisses, and  breathed a thousand vows in the most passionate language of romance.    Marionetta listened a long time in silence, till her lover had  exhausted his eloquence and paused for a reply. She then said, with a  very arch look, 'I prithee deliver thyself like a man of this world.'  The levity of this quotation, and of the manner in which it was  delivered, jarred so discordantly on the high-wrought enthusiasm of  the romantic inamorato, that he sprang upon his feet, and beat his  forehead with his clenched fist. The young lady was terrified; and,  deeming it expedient to soothe him, took one of his hands in hers,  placed the other hand on his shoulder, looked up in his face with a  winning seriousness, and said, in the tenderest possible tone, 'What  would you have, Scythrop?'    Scythrop was in heaven again. 'What would I have? What but you,  Marionetta? You, for the companion of my studies, the partner of my  thoughts, the auxiliary of my great designs for the emancipation of  mankind.'    'I am afraid I should be but a poor auxiliary, Scythrop. What would  you have me do?'    'Do as Rosalia does with Carlos, divine Marionetta. Let us each open  a vein in the other's arm, mix our blood in a bowl, and drink it as  a sacrament of love. Then we shall see visions of transcendental  illumination, and soar on the wings of ideas into the space of pure  intelligence.'    Marionetta could not reply; she had not so strong a stomach as  Rosalia, and turned sick at the proposition. She disengaged herself  suddenly from Scythrop, sprang through the door of the tower, and fled  with precipitation along the corridors. Scythrop pursued her, crying,  'Stop, stop, Marionetta--my life, my love!' and was gaining rapidly on  her flight, when, at an ill-omened corner, where two corridors ended  in an angle, at the head of a staircase, he came into sudden and  violent"]]]
