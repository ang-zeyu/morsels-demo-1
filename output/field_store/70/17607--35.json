At a play acted in 1511, on the Feast of St. Margaret, the following  disbursements were made as the charges of the exhibition:--                                         _L.   s.   d._    To musicians, for which, however,      they were bound to      perform three nights              0    5    6    For players, in bread and ale       0    3    1    For decorations, dresses, and      play-books                        1    0    0    To John Hobbard, priest, and      author of the piece               0    2    8    For the place in which the      representation was held           0    1    0    For furniture                       0    1    4    For fish and bread                  0    0    4    For painting three phantoms      and devils                        0    0    6    And for four chickens for the      hero                              0    0    4    H.

The United States ship, Vincennes, visited the island of Juan Fernandez,  off the coast of Chili, a few months since, and remained there three  days. There were two Yankees and six Otaheitans on the island. The  former had formed a settlement for the purpose of supplying whale-ships  with water, poultry, and vegetables. The soil is said to be  astonishingly fertile.    _--New York Shipping List, 1366._             *       *       *       *       *    THE LETTER H.    _From an old History of England._        \"Not superstitiously I speak, but H his letter still    Hath been observed ominous to England's good or ill.\"      Humber the Hun, with foreign arms, did first the brutes invade;    Helen to Rome's imperial throne the British crown convey'd;    Hengist and Horsus first did plant the Saxons in this isle;    Hungar and Hubba first brought Danes, that sway'd here a long while;    At Harold had the Saxon end at Hardy Knute the Dane;    Henries the First and Second did restore the English reign;    Fourth Henry first for Lancaster did England's crown obtain;    Seventh Henry jarring Lancaster and York unites in peace;    Henry the Eighth did happily Rome's irreligion cease.             *       *       *       *       *    CHURCH OF AUSTIN FRIARS.      The church of Austin Friars is one of the most ancient Gothic remains in  the City of London. It belonged to a priory dedicated to St. Augustine,  and was founded for the friars Eremites of the order of Hippo, in  Africa, by Humphry Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, 1253. A part of  this once spacious building was granted by Edward VI. to a congregation  of Germans and other strangers, who fled hither from religious  persecutions. Several successive princes have confirmed it to the Dutch,  by whom it has been used as a place of worship. J.M.C.             *       *       *       *       *    DAUPHIN OF FRANCE.    The heir apparent of the crown of France derives his title of Dauphin  from the following very singular circumstance. In 1349, Hubert, second  Count of Dauphiny, being inconsolable for the loss of his heir and only  child, who had leaped from his arms through a window of his palace at  Grenoble into the river Isere, entered into a convent of jacobins, and  ceded Dauphiny to Philip, a younger son of Philip of Valois (for 120,000  florins of gold each of the value of twenty sols or ten pence English,)  on condition that the eldest son of the king of France should be always  after styled \"the Dauphin,\" from the name of the province thus ceded.  Charles V., grandson to Philip of Valois, was the first who bore the  title in 1530.                 *       *       *       *       *    THE OLD ELEPHANT, FENCHURCH-STREET.    [Illustration: THE OLD ELEPHANT, FENCHURCH-STREET.]      Everything connected with the name of HOGARTH is interesting to the  English reader. He was apprenticed to a silversmith, and from cutting  cyphers on silver spoons, he rose to be sergeant painter to the  king--and from engraving arms and shop-bills, to painting kings and  queens--the very top of the artist's ladder. The soul-breathing impulses  of genius enabled him to effect all this, and his example, (in support  of the maxim, that \"every man is the architect of his own fortune,\")  will be respected and cherished, at home and abroad, as long as  self-advancement continues to be the great stimulus to aspiring  industry.    The old Elephant public-house therefore merits the attention of all  lovers of painting and genius; for in it, previous to his celebrity,  lodged WILLIAM HOGARTH. It was built before the fire of London, and  although so near, escaped its ravages; but the house was pulled down a  short time since, and another of more commodious construction erected on  its site. On the wall of the tap-room, in the old house, were four  paintings by Hogarth: one representing the Hudson's Bay Company's  Porters; another, his first idea for the Modern Midnight Conversation,  (differing from the print in a circumstance too broad in its humour for  the graver,) and another of Harlequin and Pierot seeming to be laughing  at the figure in the last picture. On the first floor was a picture of  Harlow Bush Fair, covered over with paint. This information is copied  from an old print picked up in our \"collecting\" rambles, at the foot of  which it is stated to have been obtained from \"Mrs. Hibbert, who has  kept the house between thirty and forty years, and received her  information relating to Mr. Hogarth from persons at that time well  acquainted with him.\" The paintings were, we believe, removed previous  to the destruction of the old house.    To the searchers into life and manners, Hogarth's moral paintings, to  which branch of art the above belong, are treasures of great prize; and  whether over his originals at the gallery in Pall Mall, or their copies  at the printsellers--the Elephant in Fenchurch-street, or the \"painting  moralist's\" tomb in Chiswick churchyard--Englishmen have just cause to  be proud of his name.               *       *       *       *       *    THE SELECTOR    AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_             *       *       *       *       *    DAYS DEPARTED; OR, BANWELL HILL:    _A Lay of the Severn Sea, by the Rev. W. Lisle Bowles._      This is a delightful volume--full of nature and truth--and in every  respect worthy of \"one of the most elegant, pathetic, and original  living poets of England.\" Moreover, it is just such a book as we  expected from the worthy vicar of Bremhill; dedicated to the Bishop of  Bath and Wells; and dated from Bremhill Parsonage, of which interesting  abode we inserted an unique description in our last volume.    As our principal object is to give a few of the _poetical pictures_, we  shall be very brief with the prose, and merely quote an outline of the  poem. Mr. Bowles, it appears, is a native of the district in which he  resides, and this circumstance introduces some beautiful retrospective  feelings:--                                   But awhile,    Here let me stand, and gaze upon the scene,    Array'd in living light around, and mark    The morning sunshine,--on that very shore    Where once a child I wander'd,--Oh! return    (I sigh,) \"return a moment, days of youth,    Of childhood,--oh, return!\"  How vain the thought,    Vain as unmanly! yet the pensive Muse,    Unblam'd, may dally with imaginings;    For this wide view is like the scene of life,    Once travers'd o'er with carelessness and glee,    And we look back upon the vale of years,    And hear remembered voices, and behold,    In blended colours, images and shades    Long pass'd, now rising, as at Memory's call,    Again in softer light.    The poem then proceeds with a description of an antediluvian cave at  Banwell, and a brief sketch of events since the deposit; but, as Mr.  Bowles observes, poetry and geological inquiry do not very amicably  travel together; we must, therefore, soon get out of the cave:--        But issuing from the Cave--look round--behold    How proudly the majestic Severn rides    On the sea,--how gloriously in light    It rides! Along this solitary ridge,    Where smiles, but rare, the blue Campanula,    Among the thistles, and grey stones, that peep    Through the thin herbage--to the highest point    Of elevation, o'er the vale below,    Slow let us climb. First, look upon that flow'r    The lowly heath-bell, smiling at our feet.    How beautiful it smiles alone! The Pow'r,    that bade the great sea roar--that spread the Heav'ns--    That call'd the sun from darkness--deck'd that flow'r,    And bade it grace this bleak and barren hill.    Imagination, in her playful mood,    Might liken it to a poor village maid,    Lowly, but smiling in her lowliness,    And dress'd so neatly, as if ev'ry day    Were Sunday. And some melancholy Bard    Might, idly musing, thus discourse to it:--    \"Daughter of Summer, who dost linger here.    Decking the thistly turf, and arid hill,    Unseen--let the majestic Dahlia    Glitter, an Empress, in her blazonry    Of beauty; let the stately Lily shine,    As snow-white as the breast of the proud Swan,    Sailing upon the blue lake silently,    That lifts her tall neck higher, as she views    The shadow in the stream! Such ladies bright    May reign unrivall'd, in their proud parterres!    Thou would'st not live with them; but if a voice,    Fancy, in shaping mood, might give to thee,    To the forsaken Primrose, thou would'st say,    'Come, live with me, and we two will rejoice:--    Nor want I company; for when the sea    Shines in the silent moonlight, elves and fays,    Gentle and delicate as Ariel,    That do their spiritings on these wild bolts--    Circle me in their dance, and sing such songs    As human ear ne'er heard!'\"--But cease the strain,    Lest Wisdom, and severer Truth, should chide.

Finally, when he had arranged his plan of assault, he confided his  intention to two friends, Lieutenant William Lawson and William Charles  Wentworth, whose names are associated with his in the conquest of the  Mountains. They both consented to accompany him, and agreed to follow his  idea of stubbornly following one leading spur. Blaxland's former  expedition had convinced him that the local knowledge of the natives did  not extend far enough to be of any service, and they therefore did not  take any aborigines with them. They took pack-horses, however, which  proves that the party started with a well-founded faith in their ultimate  success, and gave no heed to the terrifying descriptions of former  travellers.    The besetting hindrance to their progress was the low scrub of brushwood  that greatly delayed the pack-horses. This obstacle was overcome only by  patiently advancing before the horses every afternoon, and cutting a  bridle-track for the succeeding day's stage. Thus literally, the way that  ultimately led into the interior was won by foot, and the little  pioneering band eventually descended into open grazing country at the  head of what is now known as the Cox River. The outward and return trip  occupied less than one month's time; which speaks volumes for the wise  choice of route; but what says more, is the fact that no better natural,  upward pathway has since been found.    A synopsis of Blaxland's journal is given here, commencing with a few  quoted lines of preamble:--    \"On Tuesday, May 11th, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William Wentworth  and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five dogs and four  horses laden with provisions and other necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland's  farm at South Creek for the purpose of endeavouring to affect a passage  over the Blue Mountains, between the Western River* and the River  Grose...The distance travelled on this and subsequent days was computed  by time, the rate being estimated at about two miles per hour.\"    *[Footnote.] The Warragamba.    They camped at the foot of the ridge that was to witness the last  struggle between man and the Mountains. On the first day, they did three  miles and a half in a direction varying from south-west to  west-north-west, and that night obtained a little grass for the horses,  and some water in a rocky hole.    The heavy dews in the morning retarded any attempts at early departures,  as the thick wet brush rendered it difficult to drive the horses, so  that, as a rule, it was nine o'clock before they were able to strike  camp. The ridge, still favouring the direction of west and north-west, on  the third day they arrived at a tract of land, hilly, but with tolerable  grass on it. Here they found traces of a former white visitant in the  shape of a marked-tree line. Two miles from this point, they met with a  belt of brushwood so dense that for the first time they were forced to  alter their course; but the subordinate spurs on either side ending in  rocky precipices, they had to return and again confront the scrub. In  these circumstances, they made up their minds to rely upon axe and  tomahawk to win a way, and so next morning fell to work cutting a passage  for the horses. The ascent was also now becoming steep and rough, and on  this day some of the horses fell while struggling up with their loads.    The first day's work gained for them five miles, but at the end of their  toil they had to retrace their weary way back to the last night's camp.  The next day they cleared the track for only two miles further ahead; so  much time being wasted in walking backwards and forwards to the work.  There was no grass amongst the scrub that encompassed them, and when, on  Monday, they determined to move the camp equipage forward, they packed  the horses with as much cut-grass as they could put on them. This  amounted to, according to Lawson's diary, about two hundred pounds weight  for each horse, which, in addition to their ordinary loads, must have  been a very weighty packload for uphill work. However, according to  Blaxland, \"they stood it well.\" They obtained no water for their animals  that night, and what they wanted for their own requirements had to be  painfully carried up a cliff about six hundred feet in height. On the  succeeding day they suddenly came on what at first appeared to be an  impassable barrier. The ridge which they had so pertinaciously followed,  had, for the last mile narrowed and dwindled down into a sharp  razor-backed spur, flanked with rugged and abrupt gullies on either  slope. Across this narrow way now stretched a perpendicularly-sided mass  of rock, which seemed effectually to bar their path. The removal of a few  large boulders however, revealed an aperture which, after some labour,  they widened sufficiently to allow the pack-horses to squeeze through.    Once through they began to ascend what they estimated to be the second  tier of the Mountains. Shortly after they left camp that morning they  came on a pile of stones, or cairn, evidently the work of some European,  which they attributed to Bass. They were much elated at the thought that  they had now passed beyond the limit of any previous attempt.*    *[Footnote.] This cairn was afterwards named Cayley's Repulse by Governor  Macquarie: but recent research goes to show that Cayley followed the  valley of the Grose, and was many miles to the north of where the cairn  was found. According to Flinders, Bass was not on the high ridge  traversed by Blaxland and party.    They could now look round with triumph on the panorama spread beneath  their view, and from the superior elevation which they had obtained, they  took the bearings of several noticeable landmarks that they had seen  before only from the flat country. The labour of cutting a path each day  for the horses for the next day's march had, however, still to be  continued; but the crest of the ridge was again wider, though the gullies  on each side were as steep as before. That night, in camp, the dogs were  uneasy throughout the night, and several times gave tongue and aroused  the sleepers, tired with their day's work. From what they found  afterwards, they had good reason to believe that the blacks had been  lurking around meditating an attack.    They then passed over the locality known in the present day as  Blackheath, and soon afterwards had their course diverted to the  northward by what Blaxland terms \"a stone wall rising perpendicularly out  of the side of the mountain.\" This they tried to descend, but without  success, and so kept on along its brow. Undergrowth still delayed them,  and they still had to spend their energies in hewing a passage, until on  the 28th of the month, they camped on the edge of the steep descent that  had lately marched beside them. The decline was, however, not quite so  abrupt, and the face no longer composed of solid rock. They paused to  overlook what lay before them and immediately below, and found the view  more gratifying than they had anticipated. What they had at first taken  for sandy barren soil proved now, on nearer inspection, to be forest-land  fairly covered with a good growth of grass. The horses not having tasted  fresh grass for some days, they cut a slanting trench across the sloping  face of the descent in order to afford the horses some sort of foot-hold,  and managed to get them down to a little feed that evening.    Next morning they were up and away early, and reached the foot of the  mountain (Mount York) at 9 a.m., having had to carry the pack-loads down  most of the way themselves, as it was too steep for laden horses to  preserve their balance with safety. The actual base of the mountain was  reached through a gap in the rocks, some thirty feet in width.    They now found themselves on what was then termed meadow land, drained by  the upper tributaries of the Warragamba; and this country presenting no  serious obstacle to their further progress, they rightly concluded that  they had now surmounted every difficulty. They followed the mountain  stream up for some distance and, at the furthest point they reached,  ascended a high sugar-loaf hill, which surveyor Evans, who followed in  their footsteps, called Mount Blaxland. From the summit they had an  extensive view all around, and Blaxland described the character of the  country they saw in the following words: \"Forest and grass land,  sufficient to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty years.\"    Just here, let us compare this prophecy with a similar one made by Evans  a few months afterwards, on the pasture lands of the upper Macquarie:  \"The increase of stock for some hundred years cannot overrun it.\"    The provisions of the explorers were now nearly expended; their apparel,  especially their footgear, was in rags and tatters; on the other hand,  the work that they had set themselves to do was well done. They had  vanquished the Blue Mountains. Their return was uneventful. After  breakfast on the 6th of June, they crossed the Nepean, their provisions,  with the exception of a little flour, being quite consumed. We thus see  how in the end the impenetrable range, that had so long overawed the  colonists with its frown, was overcome, with slight difficulty, when  local experience combined with method, was arrayed against it. To liken  the former expeditions to Blaxland's is to compare a few headlong  assaults with a well-conceived and skilfully worked-out attack. The men  themselves write slightingly of the feat. Blaxland says: \"the passage of  the Blue Mountains might be easily effected.\" Lawson's opinion of the  mountain is: \"that there would be no difficulty in making a good road\";  and Wentworth's verdict is: \"that the country they reached is easy of  access.\" Evans, who was hot upon their trail, gives as his"]]]
