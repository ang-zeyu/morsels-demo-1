These  salts are not affected by cooking unless some process is used that  removes such of them as are readily soluble in water. When this occurs,  the result is usually waste, as, for instance, where no use is made of  the water in which some vegetables are boiled. As is true of water,  mineral matter, even though it is found in large quantities in the body,  is usually disregarded when food is purchased. This is due to the fact  that this important nutritive material appears in some form in nearly  all foods and therefore does not necessitate the housewife's stopping to  question its presence.    14. Protein.--The food substance known as protein is a very important  factor in the growth and repair of the body; in fact, these processes  cannot be carried on unless protein is present in the diet. However,  while a certain quantity of protein is essential, the amount is not very  large and more than is required is likely to be harmful, or, since the  body can make no use of it, to be at least waste material. The principal  sources of protein are lean meat, eggs, milk, certain grains, nuts, and  the legumes, which include such foods as beans and peas. Because of the  ease with which they are digested, meat, fish, eggs, and milk are more  valuable sources of protein than bread, beans, and nuts. However, as the  foods that are most valuable for proteins cost more than others, a mixed  diet is necessary if only a limited amount of money with which to  purchase foods is available.    15. So much is involved in the cooking of foods containing protein that  the effect of heat on such foods should be thoroughly understood. The  cooking of any food, as is generally understood, tends to break up the  food and prepare it for digestion. However, foods have certain  characteristics, such as their structure and texture, that influence  their digestibility, and the method of cooking used or the degree to  which the cooking is carried so affects these characteristics as to  increase or decrease the digestibility of the food. In the case of foods  containing protein, unless the cooking is properly done, the application  of heat is liable to make the protein indigestible, for the heat first  coagulates this substance--that is, causes it to become thick--and  then, as the heat increases, shrinks and hardens it. This fact is  clearly demonstrated in the cooking of an egg, the white of which is the  type of protein called _albumin_. In a raw egg, the albumin is nearly  liquid, but as heat is applied, it gradually coagulates until it becomes  solid. If the egg is cooked too fast or too long, it toughens and  shrinks and becomes less palatable, less attractive, and less  digestible. However, if the egg is properly cooked after the heat has  coagulated the albumin, the white will remain tender and the yolk will  be fine and mealy in texture, thus rendering it digestible.    Similar results, although not so evident to the sight, are brought about  through the right or wrong way of cooking practically all other foods  that contain much protein. Milk, whose principal ingredient is a protein  known as _casein_, familiar as the curd of cheese, illustrates this fact  very plainly. When it is used to make cottage cheese, heating it too  long or to too high a degree will toughen the curd and actually spoil  the texture of the product, which will be grainy and hard, instead of  smooth and tender.    16. FATS.--The food substances just discussed--water, mineral matter,  and protein--yield the materials required for building and repairing the  tissues of the body, but, as has been explained, the body also requires  foods that produce energy, or working power. By far the greater part of  the total solids of food taken into the body serve this purpose, and of  these fats form a large percentage. Although fats make up such a large  proportion of the daily food supply, they enter into the body  composition to a less extent than do the food substances that have been  explained. The fats commonly used for food are of both animal and  vegetable origin, such as lard, suet, butter, cream, olive oil, nut oil,  and cottonseed oil. The ordinary cooking temperatures have comparatively  little effect on fat, except to melt it if it is solid. The higher  temperatures decompose at least some of it, and thus liberate substances  that may be irritating to the digestive tract.    17. CARBOHYDRATES.--Like fats, the food substances included in the term  carbohydrates supply the body with energy. However, fats and  carbohydrates differ in the forms in which they supply energy, the  former producing it in the most concentrated form and the latter in the  most economical form.    So that the term _carbohydrate_ may be clearly understood and firmly  fixed in the mind, it is deemed advisable to discuss briefly the  composition of the body and the food that enters it. Of course, in a  lesson on cookery, not so much attention need be given to this matter as  in a lesson on _dietetics_, which is a branch of hygiene that treats of  diet; nevertheless, it is important that every person who prepares food  for the table be familiar with the fact that the body, as well as food,  is made up of a certain number of chemical elements, of which nitrogen,  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen form a large part. Protein owes its  importance to the fact that of the various food substances it alone  contains the element nitrogen, which is absolutely essential to the  formation of any plant or animal tissue. The other three elements,  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, go to make up the carbohydrates; in fact,  it is from the names of these three elements that the term carbohydrate  is derived. The carbohydrates include the starches and sugars that are  used and eaten in so many forms, and these contain the three elements  mentioned, the hydrogen and oxygen contained in them being in the  proportion that produces water. Thus, as will readily be seen, by  separating the name into its parts--_carbo_ (carbon) and _hydrate_  (hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of two parts of hydrogen and one  of oxygen, that is, in the form of water)--carbohydrate is simply carbon  united with water. While the facts just brought out have much to do with  food economy, they are of interest here chiefly because they help to  make clear the term carbohydrate, which, as will be admitted, is the  only correct name for the food substance it represents.    18. STARCH, one of the chief forms of carbohydrates, is found in only  the vegetable kingdom. It is present in large quantities in the grains  and in potatoes; in fact, nearly all vegetables contain large or small  amounts of it. It is stored in the plant in the form of granules that  lie within the plant cells.    Cooking applied to starch changes it into a form that is digestible.  Moist heat cooks the granules until they expand and burst and thus  thicken the mass. Dry heat changes starch first into a soluble form and  finally into what is called _dextrine_, this being the intermediate step  in the changing of starch into sugar.    19. SUGAR, another important form of carbohydrate, is mainly of  vegetable origin, except that which is found in milk and called  _lactose_. This, together with the fat found in milk, supplies the child  with energy before it is able to digest a variety of foods. The sap of  various plants contains such large quantities of sugar that it can be  crystalized out and secured in dry form. The liquid that remains is  valuable as food, for, by boiling it down, it forms molasses. Sugar is  also present in considerable amounts in all fruits, and much of it is in  a form that can be assimilated, or taken up by the body, quickly. A  sugar very similar to this natural fruit sugar is made from the starch  of corn and is called _glucose_. Much of the carbohydrate found in  vegetables, especially young, tender vegetables, is in the form of  sugar, which, as the vegetables grow older, changes to starch.    Sugar melts upon the application of heat or, if it is in a melted  condition, as sirup or molasses, it boils down and gives off water. When  all the water has boiled away, the sugar begins to caramelize or become  brown, and develops a characteristic flavor. If the cooking is continued  too long, a dark-brown color and a bitter taste are developed. Because  the sugar in fruits and vegetables is in solution, some of it is lost  when they are boiled, unless, of course, the water in which they are  cooked is utilized.    20. CELLULOSE is a form of carbohydrate closely related to starch. It  helps to form the structure of plants and vegetables. Very little  cellulose is digested, but it should not be ignored, because it gives  the necessary bulk to the food in which it occurs and because strict  attention must be paid to the cooking of it. As cellulose usually  surrounds nutritive material of vegetable origin, it must be softened  and loosened sufficiently by cooking to permit the nutritive material to  be dissolved by the digestive juices. Then, too, in old vegetables,  there is more starch and the cellulose is harder and tougher, just as an  old tree is much harder than a sapling. This, then, accounts for the  fact that rapid cooking is needed for some vegetables and slow cooking  for others, the method and the time of cooking depending on the presence  and the consistency of the cellulose that occurs in the food.    21. IMPORTANCE OF A VARIETY OF FOODS.--Every one of the five food  substances just considered must be included in a person's diet; yet,  with the exception of milk, no single food yields the right amounts of  material necessary for tissue building and repair and for heat and  energy. Even milk is in the right proportion, as far as its food  substances are concerned, only for babies and very young children. It  will thus be seen that to provide the body with the right foods, the  diet must be such as to include all the food substances."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#3)"],[1,"salad that is also acid will be likely to add more of a sour flavor than  the majority of persons desire.    Then, too, it is not a good plan to serve in the salad the same  vegetable that is served in the soup or the dinner course. Thus, creamed  celery and a salad containing celery, and tomato soup and tomato salad  are bad combinations and should, like others similar to them, be  carefully avoided. Even though such vegetables may be on hand in  quantity, they can usually be kept for another meal.      PRINCIPLES OF SALAD MAKING    21. CONDITION OF SALAD INGREDIENTS.--When the kind of salad to be served  is decided on, the selection and preparation of the materials are the  next matters to receive attention. Very often materials that are on hand  are utilized in this way, but if it is possible to select the  ingredients expressly for the salad, they should be very carefully  chosen. Any kind of salad, but particularly a vegetable or a fruit  salad, becomes much more attractive if it is made with ingredients that  are in good condition and that are attractive in appearance. They should  therefore be fresh and crisp and never mushy, wilted, nor limp. Of  course, this does not mean that material that is slightly unattractive  must be discarded, for it can usually be prepared so that it can be  utilized in some way. However, much of the deterioration of salad  ingredients before they are used can be avoided if proper attention is  given to them after they come into the home. Without doubt, the best way  in which to keep radishes, celery, parsley, watercress, and other greens  that are much used in salads is to wrap them loosely in a moist cloth as  soon as they are received in the home and then put them in a cool place.  Small muslin or linen bags having a draw-string in the top are very good  for this purpose, but they are not a necessity, for old napkins or small  pieces of worn cloth will do very well.    22. CLEANING AND FRESHENING SALAD INGREDIENTS.--In the making of a  salad, the cleaning of the ingredients used is a very important part of  the work. While nothing should be wasted in the process of preparation,  decayed or discolored leaves, stems, or parts of fruits and vegetables  should, of course, be removed. Every lettuce leaf and every part of  other salad vegetables should be looked over carefully and washed  separately in cold water. To accomplish this, the stalks or leaves must  be taken apart after the root is cut off. Then, before they are used,  they should be examined carefully again in order to make sure that no  small bugs nor worms and no dirt remain on them. Such vegetables will  become crisp if they are allowed to remain in cold water long enough to  bring back their natural freshness. A little ice added to the water  helps to accomplish this more quickly. It should be remembered, however  that lettuce leaves bruise and break easily and so must be handled  carefully if the best appearance is desired.    23. When cucumbers are to be used for salad, they should be peeled and  put immediately into cold water to become crisp, or they may first be  sliced or diced and then put into the cold water. They should never be  allowed to stand for any length of time in salt water. If it is desired  to season them with salt, a little may be added to the water in which  they are made crisp, but it will also be necessary to add ice to make  the water as cold as possible. The old idea that soaking cucumbers in  salted water removes something injurious has been proved to be untrue,  and they are just as satisfactory, so far as their flavor and condition  are concerned, when they are not subjected to this treatment. Radishes,  celery, and cabbage may be made crisp in the same way as are cucumbers  and lettuce.    In the event that any of these vegetables are allowed to stand in water,  they must be properly drained before they are used in a salad, for any  water that remains on them will dilute the dressing. If they must be  dried very quickly, they may be patted carefully between folds of cloth,  preferably linen or cheesecloth, or they may be allowed to stand for a  few minutes in a wire basket or a colander. Care should be taken,  however, not to allow them to stand until the good that has been  accomplished by making them crisp in cold water is undone.    24. PREPARING FRUITS FOR SALADS.--After fruits have been carefully  cleaned, they are ready to be peeled and cut into pieces of the size  desired for the salad. An effort should always be made to have the  pieces equal in size, similar in shape, and not too small. They should  be peeled in an economical way, but at the same time should be prepared  as attractively as possible.    25. In the preparation of oranges for a salad, the fruit is peeled as if  it were an apple, the peeling being cut deeply enough to remove the skin  that covers the sections. After the entire orange is peeled, the  contents of each section should be removed by passing a sharp knife as  closely as possible to the skin between the sections and then taking out  the pulp without any of this skin. The sections may then be used whole  or cut into pieces.    Grapefruit may be prepared in the same way as oranges. Upon the removal  of the whole sections, they may be left whole or they may be cut once or  twice, depending on the kind of salad and the appearance desired. When  grapefruit or oranges are prepared in this manner, they make a much more  agreeable ingredient for fruit salad than when they are simply cut into  chunks and the tough skin is allowed to remain on the pieces. No waste  need be permitted in this process, for the juice may be extracted from  what remains after the sections have been removed by pressing it in a  fruit press or by any other means and then utilized in the making of the  salad dressing or kept for some other purpose.    Bananas, which are often used in salads, should be peeled, any bruised  or decayed portions should be removed, and the surface should then be  scraped slightly with a paring knife in order to remove the pithy  surface, which, when eaten, has a puckery, disagreeable effect.    26. When fruits of any kind have been prepared for salad and cannot be  used at once, they may be kept from wilting and discoloring if they are  put where they will keep cool and are sprinkled with a little lemon  juice that is slightly diluted with water. Before the salad materials  are mixed with the salad dressing, however, all juices or liquid of any  kind should be carefully drained from them, for these will dilute the  dressing and produce a salad that is less appetizing in both appearance  and flavor.    27. PREPARING NUTS FOR SALADS.--When nuts are to be used in a salad,  they should never be ground in a grinder; rather, they should be chopped  or cut into small pieces with a knife. After being so prepared, they  should be added to the salad just before it is put on the table. This is  a matter that should not be overlooked, for if the salad is allowed to  stand very long after the nuts are added they will discolor the dressing  and cause the salad to become dark and gray looking.    28. MARINATING SALAD INGREDIENTS.--To improve the flavor of such salads  as chicken, veal, lobster, or crab, the ingredients are usually  marinated with a sour dressing of some description before the salad  dressing is added. As is explained in Essentials of Cookery, Part 2,  marinating involves the seasoning of meat or fish by means of vinegar or  French dressing. The preparation used to marinate salad ingredients may  be plain vinegar to which salt and pepper are added, or it may be a  French dressing, which is prepared by mixing vinegar, olive oil, salt,  and pepper in the proper proportions. Whichever preparation is used  should be poured over the materials after they are cut or prepared for  the salad, and only enough to moisten each piece slightly should be  used. The ingredients should then be carefully mixed with the dressing  to avoid breaking or crushing them and should be allowed to stand in a  cold place for a few minutes. Then they should be drained so that none  of the material used to marinate them remains on the salad when the  other dressing is added. With this done, the salad is ready for whatever  salad dressing is to be used.    29. Potato salad and salads containing such vegetables as carrots, peas,  string beans, etc. are also improved by being marinated in the same way  as salads made of meat, fowl, and fish. This sort of preparation  involves a little more work, it is true, but it usually produces such  gratifying results that it justifies the expenditure of the extra  effort. In the first place, a slightly smaller amount of salad dressing  will be required when the ingredients are marinated and, in addition, a  better looking dish can be made, for the dressing need not be mixed with  the salad but merely placed on top.    30. In case the housewife prefers not to take the time nor the trouble  to marinate a salad, she should at least mix thoroughly with salt and  pepper the ingredients that require seasoning. The fact that a salad  should be a well and highly seasoned dish must never be overlooked. As  can be readily understood, a bland salad without character is never so  appetizing as one that is crisp, fresh, well made, and properly seasoned.      SERVING SALADS    31. Several different ways of serving salads are in practice. Perhaps  the most convenient method of serving this dish is to prepare individual  portions of it on salad plates in the kitchen and then set these on the  table at each person's place. If a simple table service is followed, the  salad may be put on the table at the same time as the rest of the meal.  The correct position for the salad plate is at the left-hand side of the  dinner plate and just a little nearer to the edge of the table than the  bread-and-butter plate. The plates on which salad is served should be  large enough "]]]
