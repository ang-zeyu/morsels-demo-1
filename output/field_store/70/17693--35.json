If God's purpose is to make everything good, man's highest  privilege, as well as duty, is to co-operate with him in realizing  that purpose.  Are men to-day as a whole growing happier and  nobler?  In what practical ways may a man contribute to the  happiness and ennobling of his fellow men?    Is your community growing better?  What would be the result if you  and others like yourself did your best to improve conditions?  If  so, how?      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    Is man's possession of knowledge and power the ultimate object of  creation?  If not, what is?  Does human experience suggest that  man's life on earth is, in its ultimate meaning, simply a school  for the development of individual character and for the perfecting  of the human race?    Is there any other practical way in which a man can serve God  except by serving his fellowmen?  If so, how?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it  was a delight to the eye, and that the tree was to be desired to  make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she  gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat.  And the eyes  of them both were opened and they beard the voice of Jehovah God  walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his  wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the  trees of the garden.--_Gen. 3:6-8_.    Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been  approved, he shall receive a crown of life, which the Lord promised  to them that love him.  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am  tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself  tempteth no man; but each man is tempted when he is drawn away by  his own lust and enticed.  Then the lust, when it hath conceived,  beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth  death.--_James 1:12-15_.      For the love of God is broader      Than the measure of man's mind,    And the heart of the eternal      Is most wonderfully kind.--_Frederick W. Faber_.    None could enter into life but those who were in downright earnest  and unless they left the wicked world behind them; for there was  only room for body and soul, but not for body and soul and  sin.--_John Bunyan_.      I.    THE NATURE OF SIN.    Henry Drummond has said that sin is a little word that has wandered  out of theology into life.    Members of a secret organization known as the Thugs of India feel  at times that it is their solemn duty to strangle certain of their  fellow men.  Do they thereby commit a sin?  A Parsee believes that  it is wrong to light a cigar, for it is a desecration of his emblem  of purity--fire.  Others in the western world for very different  reasons regard the same act as wrong.  Is the lighting or smoking  of a cigar a sin for these classes?  Is the act necessarily wrong  in itself?    When a trained dog fails to obey his master, does he sin?  Is man  alone capable of sinning?      II.    THE DIFFERENT THEORIES REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF SIN.    Many and various have been the definitions of sin and the  explanations of its origin.  Most primitive peoples defined it as  failure to perform certain ceremonial acts, or to bring tribute to  the gods.  Morality and religion were rarely combined.  The Hebrew  people were the first to define right and wrong in terms of  personal life and service.  Sin as represented in Genesis 3 was the  result of individual choice.  It was yielding to the common rather  than the nobler impulses, to desire rather than to the sense of  duty.  The temptation came from within rather than from without,  and the responsibility of not choosing the best rested with the  individual.  The explanation is as simple and as true to human  experience to-day as in the childhood of the race.    The Persian religion, on the contrary, conceived of the world as  controlled by two hostile gods, with their hosts of attendant  angels.  One god, Ormuzd, was the embodiment of light and goodness.  The other, Ahriman, represented darkness and evil.  They traced all  sin to the direct influence of Ahriman and the evil spirits that  attended him.  During the Persian period a somewhat similar  explanation of the origin of evil appeared in Jewish thought.  Satan, who in the book of Job appears to be simply the prosecuting  attorney of heaven, began to be thought of as the enemy of man,  until in later times all sin was traced directly or indirectly to  his influence.  This was the conception prevalent among the  Puritans.  This view tended to relieve man of personal  responsibility for he was regarded as the victim of assaults of  hosts of malignant spirits.  Does your knowledge of the heart of  man confirm the insight of the prophet who speaks through the  wonderful story of Genesis 3?      III.    THE ORIGIN OF SIN ACCORDING TO THE STORY IN GENESIS 3.    In your judgment is the story of the man and the woman in Genesis 3  a chapter from the life of a certain man and woman, or a faithful  reflection of universal human experience?  Most of the elements  which are found in the story may likewise be traced in earlier  Semitic traditions.  The aim of the prophet who has given us the  story was, according to the view of certain interpreters, to  present in vivid, concrete form the origin, nature, and  consequences of sin.  This method of teaching was similar to that  which Jesus used, for example, in the parable of Dives and Lazarus.  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, with the command not to  eat of it, apparently symbolizes temptation.  Is temptation  necessary for man's moral development? The serpent was evidently  chosen because of its reputation for craft and treachery.  The  serpent's words represent the natural inclinations that were  struggling in the mind of the woman against her sense of duty.  Note that in the story the temptation did not come to man through  his appetite or his curiosity or his esthetic sense but through his  wife whom God had given him.  Was the man's act in any way  excusable?  Strong men and women often sin through the influence of  those whom they love and admire.  Are they thereby excused?  What  natural impulses impelled the woman to disobey the divine command?  Were these impulses of themselves wrong?  How far did her  experience reflect common human experience?  What was the real  nature of her act?  Was it wrong or praise-worthy for her to desire  knowledge?    In what form did temptation come to the man in Genesis 3.  Does  temptation appeal in a different form to each individual?  The  Hebrew word for sin (which means to miss the mark placed before  each individual) vividly and aptly describes the real nature of  sin.  The ideal placed before each individual represents his sense  of what is right.  If he acts contrary to that ideal or fails to  strive to realize it, does he sin?      IV.    THE EFFECTS OF SIN UPON THE WRONG-DOER.    What was the effect of their consciousness of having disobeyed upon  the man and woman in the ancient story?  Did they believe that they  had done wrong, or merely that they had incurred a penalty?  Does  sin tend to make cowards of men?  Were the feelings of shame, and  the sense of estrangement in the presence of one who loved them,  the most tragic effect of their sin?  When a child disobeys a  parent or a friend wrongs a friend is the sense of having injured a  loved one the most painful consequence of sin?  Was the penalty  imposed on the man and woman the result of a divine judgment or the  natural and inevitable effect of wrong-doing?  Why did the man and  woman try to excuse their disobedience?  Was it natural?  Was it  good policy?  Was it right?  If not, why not?      V.    GOD'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SINNER.    Jehovah in the story evidently asked the man and woman a question,  the answer to which he already knew, in order to give them an  opportunity to confess their wrong-doing.  Parents and teachers  often seek to give the culprit the opportunity to confess his sin.  What is the attitude of the law towards the criminal who pleads  guilty?  What is the reason for this attitude?  A loving parent or  even the state might forgive an unrepentant sinner, but the effect  of the wrong-doing upon the sinner and upon others may still remain.    While the man and woman remained conscious of their wrong-doing,  though defiant, to abide in Jehovah's presence was for them  intolerable.  Are toil and pain essential to the moral development  of sinners who refuse to confess their crime?  Are toil and pain in  themselves curses or blessings to those who have done wrong?  The  picture in Genesis 3 clearly implies that God's intention was not  that man should suffer but that he should enjoy perfect health and  happiness.  Jehovah's preparation of the coats of skin for the man  and woman is convincing evidence that his love and care continued  unremittingly even for the wrong doers.  Modern psychology is  making it clear that the effect of sin upon the unrepentant sinner  is to increase his inclination toward sinning.  But when a man in  penitence for his sin has turned toward God and changed his  relation to his fellow men, God becomes to him a new Being with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#4)"],[1," should not worry so much; I'd attribute it to disease. But every  day something of vitality goes from him. He is fading almost from hour  to hour, as slowly as the hour hand of a clock. You can't notice the  change, but every twelve hours the hand makes a complete revolution.  It's as if his blood were evaporating and nothing we can do will supply  him with fresh strength.\"    \"Is this attended by irritability?\"    \"He is perfectly calm and seems to have no care for what becomes of  him.\"    \"Has he lost interest in the things which formerly attracted and  occupied him?\"    \"Yes, he minds nothing now. He has no care for the condition of the  cattle, or for profit or loss in the sales. He has simply stepped out of  every employment.\"    \"Ah, a gradual diminution of the faculties of attention.\"    \"In a way, yes. But also he is more alive than he has ever been. He  seems to hear with uncanny distinctness, for instance.\"    The doctor frowned.    \"I was inclined to attribute his decline to the operation of old age,\"  he remarked, \"but this is unusual. This--er--inner acuteness is  accompanied by no particular interest in any one thing?\".    As she did not reply for the moment he was about to accept the silence  for acquiescence, but then through the dimness he was arrested by the  lustre of her eyes, fixed, apparently, far beyond him.    \"One thing,\" she said at length. \"Yes, there is one thing in which he  retains an interest.\"    The doctor nodded brightly.    \"Good!\" he said. \"And that--?\"    The silence fell again, but this time he was more roused and he fixed  his eyes keenly upon her through the gloom. She was deeply troubled; one  hand gripped the horn of her saddle strongly; her lips had parted; she  was like one who endures inescapable pain. He could not tell whether it  was the slight breeze which disturbed her blouse or the rapid panting of  her breath.    \"Of that,\" she said, \"it is hard to speak--it is useless to speak!\"    \"Surely not!\" protested the doctor. \"The cause, my dear madame, though  perhaps apparently remote from the immediate issue, is of the utmost  significance in diagnosis.\"    She broke in rapidly: \"This is all I can tell you: he is waiting for  something which will never come. He has missed something from his life  which will never come back into it. Then why should we discuss what it  is that he has missed.\"    \"To the critical mind,\" replied the doctor calmly, and he automatically  adjusted his glasses closer to his eyes, \"nothing is without  significance.\"    \"It is nearly dark!\" she exclaimed hurriedly. \"Let us ride on.\"    \"First,\" he suggested, \"I must tell you that before I left Elkhead I  heard a hint of some remarkable story concerning a man and a horse and a  dog. Is there anything--\"    But it seemed that she did not hear. He heard a sharp, low exclamation  which might have been addressed to her horse, and the next instant she  was galloping swiftly down the slope. The doctor followed as fast as he  could, jouncing in the saddle until he was quite out of breath.          CHAPTER IV    THE CHAIN      They had hardly passed the front door of the house when they were met by  a tall man with dark hair and dark, deep-set eyes. He was tanned to the  bronze of an Indian, and he might have been termed handsome had not his  features been so deeply cut and roughly finished. His black hair was  quite long, and as the wind from the opened door stirred it, there was a  touch of wildness about the fellow that made the heart of Randall Byrne  jump. When this man saw the girl his face lighted, briefly; when his  glance fell on Byrne the light went out.    \"Couldn't get the doc, Kate?\" he asked.    \"Not Doctor Hardin,\" she answered, \"and I've brought Doctor Byrne  instead.\"    The tall man allowed his gaze to drift leisurely from head to foot of  Randall Byrne.    Then: \"H'ware you, doc?\" he said, and extended a big hand. It occurred  to Byrne that all these men of the mountain-desert were big; there was  something intensely irritating about their mere physical size; they  threw him continually on the defensive and he found himself making  apologies to himself and summing up personal merits. In this case there  was more direct reason for his anger. It was patent that the man did  not weight the strange doctor against any serious thoughts.    \"And this,\" she was saying, \"is Mr. Daniels. Buck, is there any change?\"    \"Nothin' much,\" answered Buck Daniels. \"Come along towards evening and  he said he was feeling kind of cold. So I wrapped him up in a rug. Then  he sat some as usual, one hand inside of the other, looking steady at  nothing. But a while ago he began getting sort of nervous.\"    \"What did he do?\"    \"Nothing. I just _felt_ he was getting excited. The way you know when  your hoss is going to shy.\"    \"Do you want to go to your room first, doctor, or will you go in to see  him now?\"    \"Now,\" decided the doctor, and followed her down the hall and through a  door.    The room reminded the doctor more of a New England interior than of the  mountain-desert. There was a round rag rug on the floor with every  imaginable colour woven into its texture, but blended with a rude  design, reds towards the centre and blue-greys towards the edges. There  were chairs upholstered in green which looked mouse-coloured where the  high lights struck along the backs and the arms--shallow-seated chairs  that made one's knees project foolishly high and far. Byrne saw a  cabinet at one end of the room, filled with sea-shells and knicknacks,  and above it was a memorial cross surrounded by a wreath inside a glass  case. Most of the wall space thronged with engravings whose subjects  ranged from Niagara Falls to Lady Hamilton. One entire end of the room  was occupied by a painting of a neck and neck finish in a race, and the  artist had conceived the blooded racers as creatures with tremendous  round hips and mighty-muscled shoulders, while the legs tapered to a  faun-like delicacy. These animals were spread-eagled in the most amazing  fashion, their fore-hoofs reaching beyond their noses and their rear  hoofs striking out beyond the tips of the tails. The jockey in the lead  sat quite still, but he who was losing had his whip drawn and looked  like an automatic doll--so pink were his cheeks. Beside the course, in  attitudes of graceful ease, stood men in very tight trousers and very  high stocks and ladies in dresses which pinched in at the waist and  flowed out at the shoulders. They leaned upon canes or twirled parasols  and they had their backs turned upon the racetrack as if they found  their own negligent conversation far more exciting than the breathless,  driving finish.    Under the terrific action and still more terrific quiescence of this  picture lay the sick man, propped high on a couch and wrapped to the  chest in a Navajo blanket.    \"Dad,\" said Kate Cumberland, \"Doctor Hardin was not in town. I've  brought out Doctor Byrne, a newcomer.\"    The invalid turned his white head slowly towards them, and his shaggy  brows lifted and fell slightly--a passing shadow of annoyance. It was a  very stern face, and framed in the long, white hair it seemed  surrounded by an atmosphere of Arctic chill. He was thin, terribly  thin--not the leanness of Byrne, but a grim emaciation which exaggerated  the size of a tall forehead and made his eyes supernally bright. It was  in the first glance of those eyes that Byrne recognized the restlessness  of which Kate had spoken; and he felt almost as if it were an inner fire  which had burned and still was wasting the body of Joseph Cumberland. To  the attentions of the doctor the old man submitted with patient  self-control, and Byrne found a pulse feeble, rapid, but steady. There  was no temperature. In fact, the heat of the body was a trifle  sub-normal, considering that the heart was beating so rapidly.    Doctor Byrne started. Most of his work had been in laboratories, and the  horror of death was not yet familiar, but old Joseph Cumberland was  dying. It was not a matter of moment. Death might be a week or a month  away, but die soon he inevitably must; for the doctor saw that the fire  was still raging in the hollow breast of the cattleman, but there was no  longer fuel to feed it.    He stared again, and more closely. Fire without fuel to feed it!    Doctor Byrne gave what seemed to be an infinitely muffled cry of  exultation, so faint that it was hardly a whisper; then he leaned closer  and pored over Joe Cumberland with a lighted eye. One might have thought  that the doctor was gloating over the sick man.    Suddenly he straightened and began to pace up and down the room,  muttering to himself. Kate Cumberland listened intently and she thought  that what the man muttered so rapidly, over and over to himself, was:  \"Eureka! Eureka! I have found it!\"    Found what? The triumph of mind over matter!    On that couch was a dead body. The flutter of that heart was not the  strong beating of the normal organ; the hands were cold; even the body  was chilled; yet the man lived.    Or, rather, his brain lived, and compelled the shattered and outworn  body to comply with its will. Doctor Byrne turned and stared again at  the face of Cumberland. He felt as if he understood, now, the look which  was concentrated so brightly on the vacant air. It was illumined by a  steady and desperate defiance, for the old man was denying his body to  the grave.    The scene changed for Randall Byrne. The girl disappeared. The walls of  the room were broken away. The eyes of the world looked in upon him and  the wise men of the world kept pace with him up and down the room,  shaking their heads and saying: \"It is not possible!\"    But the fact lay there to contradict them.    Prometheus stole fire from heaven and paid it back to an eternal death.  The old cattleman was refusing his payment. It was no state of coma in  which he lay; it was no prolonged trance. He was vitally,"]]]
