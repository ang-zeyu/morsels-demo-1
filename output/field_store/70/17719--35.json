[Errors have been corrected in this ebook]        INTRODUCTION.    The voyages which had been made, during the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries, by Dutch and by English navigators, had successively brought  to light various extensive coasts in the southern hemisphere, which were  thought to be united; and to comprise a land, which must be nearly equal  in magnitude to the whole of Europe. To this land, though known to be  separated from all other great portions of the globe, geographers were  disposed to give the appellation of Continent: but doubts still existed,  of the continuity of its widely extended shores; and it was urged, that,  as our knowledge of some parts was not founded upon well authenticated  information, and we were in total ignorance of some others, these coasts  might, instead of forming one great land, be no other than parts of  different large islands.    The establishment, in 1788, of a British colony on the easternmost, and  last discovered, of these new regions, had added that degree of interest  to the question of their continuity, which a mother country takes in  favour, even, of her outcast children, to know the form, extent, and  general nature of the land, where they may be placed. The question had,  therefore, ceased to be one in which geography was alone concerned: it  claimed the paternal consideration of the father of all his people, and  the interests of the national commerce seconded the call for  investigation.    Accordingly, the following voyage was undertaken by command of HIS  MAJESTY, in the year 1801; in a ship of 334 tons, which received the  appropriate name of the INVESTIGATOR; and, besides great objects of  clearing up the doubt respecting the unity of these southern regions, and  of opening therein fresh sources to commerce, and new ports to seamen, it  was intended, that the voyage should contribute to the advancement of  natural knowledge in various branches; and that some parts of the  neighbouring seas should he visited, wherein geography and navigation had  still much to desire.    The vast regions to which this voyage was principally directed,  comprehend, in the western part, the early discoveries of the Dutch,  under the name of NEW HOLLAND; and in the east, the coasts explored by  British navigators, and named NEW SOUTH WALES. It has not, however, been  unusual to apply the first appellation to both regions; but to continue  this, would be almost as great an injustice to the British nation, whose  seamen have had so large a share in the discovery, as it would be to the  Dutch, were New South Wales to be so extended. This appears to have been  felt by a neighbouring, and even rival, nation; whose writers commonly  speak of these countries under the general term of _Terres Australes_. In  fact, the original name, used by the Dutch themselves until some time  after Tasman's second voyage, in 1644, was _Terra Australis_, or _Great  South Land_; and when it was displaced by New Holland, the new term was  applied only to the parts lying _westward_ of a meridian line, passing  through Arnhem's Land on the north., and near the isles of St. Francis  and St. Peter, on the south: all to the eastward, including the shores of  the Gulph of Carpentaria, still remained as Terra Australis. This appears  from a chart published by THEVENOT, in 1663; which, he says, \"was  originally taken from that done in inlaid work, upon the pavement of the  new Stadt-House at Amsterdam.\" * The same thing is to be inferred from the  notes of Burgomaster WITSEN, in 1705; of which there will be occasion to  speak in the sequel.    [* \"La carte que l'on a mise icy, tire sa premiere origine de celle que  l'on a fait tailler de pieces rapportees, sur le pave de la nouvelle  Maison-de-Ville d'Amsterdam.\" _Relations de divers Voyages  curieux._--Avis.]    It is necessary, however, to geographical precision, that so soon as New  Holland and New South Wales were known to form one land, there should be  a general name applicable to the whole; and this essential point having  been ascertained in the present voyage, with a degree of certainty  sufficient to authorise the measure, I have, with the concurrence of  opinions entitled to deference, ventured upon the re-adoption of the  _original_ TERRA AUSTRALIS; and of this term I shall hereafter make use,  when speaking of New Holland and New South Wales, in a collective sense;  and when using it in the most extensive signification, the adjacent  isles, including that of Van Diemen, must be understood to be  comprehended.    There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly  equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name  Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical  importance of this country, and of its situation on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],[0,"A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"teacher, who explained those terms to him. The teacher himself  had got it from his teacher, and he from his. There was no tendency to  popularize philosophy, for the idea then prevalent was that only the  chosen few who had otherwise shown their fitness, deserved to become  fit students (_adhikari_) of philosophy, under the direction of a  teacher. Only those who had the grit and high moral strength to devote  their whole life to the true understanding of philosophy and the  rebuilding of life in accordance with the high truths of philosophy  were allowed to study it.    Another difficulty which a beginner will meet is this, that sometimes  the same technical terms are used in extremely different senses in  different systems. The student must know the meaning of each technical  term with reference to the system in which it occurs, and no dictionary  will enlighten him much about the matter [Footnote ref 1]. He will have  to pick them up as he advances and finds them used. Allusions to the  doctrines of other systems and their refutations during the discussions  of similar doctrines in any particular system of thought are often very  puzzling even to a well-equipped reader; for he cannot be expected to  know all the doctrines of other systems without going through them, and  so it often becomes difficult to follow the series of answers and  refutations which are poured forth in the course of these discussions.  There are two important compendiums in Sanskrit giving a summary of some  of the principal systems of Indian thought, viz. the  _Sarvadars'anasa@mgraha_, and the _@Sa@ddars'anasamuccaya_ of  Haribhadra with the commentary of Gu@naratna; but the former is very  sketchy and can throw very little light on the understanding  of the ontological or epistemological doctrines of any of the  systems. It has been translated by Cowell and Gough, but I    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Recently a very able Sanskrit dictionary of technical  philosophical terms called Nyayakos'a has been prepared by M.M.  Bhimacarya Jhalkikar, Bombay, Govt. Press.]    3    am afraid the translation may not be found very intelligible.  Gu@naratna's commentary is excellent so far as Jainism is concerned,  and it sometimes gives interesting information about other systems,  and also supplies us with some short bibliographical notices, but it  seldom goes on to explain the epistemological or ontological doctrines  or discussions which are so necessary for the right understanding of any  of the advanced systems of Indian thought. Thus in the absence of a book  which could give us in brief the main epistemological, ontological, and  psychological positions of the Indian thinkers, it is difficult even for  a good Sanskrit scholar to follow the advanced philosophical literature,  even though he may be acquainted with many of the technical philosophical  terms. I have spoken enough about the difficulties of studying Indian  philosophy, but if once a person can get himself used to the technical  terms and the general positions of the different Indian thinkers and their  modes of expression, he can master the whole by patient toil. The  technical terms, which are a source of difficulty at the beginning, are  of inestimable value in helping us to understand the precise and definite  meaning of the writers who used them, and the chances of misinterpreting  or misunderstanding them are reduced to a minimum. It is I think  well-known that avoidance of technical terms has often rendered  philosophical works unduly verbose, and liable to misinterpretation.  The art of clear writing is indeed a rare virtue and every philosopher  cannot expect to have it. But when technical expressions are properly  formed, even a bad writer can make himself understood. In the early days  of Buddhist philosophy in the Pali literature, this difficulty is greatly  felt. There are some technical terms here which are still very elastic and  their repetition in different places in more or less different senses  heighten the difficulty of understanding the real meaning intended to be  conveyed.    But is it necessary that a history of Indian philosophy should be  written? There are some people who think that the Indians never rose  beyond the stage of simple faith and that therefore they cannot have  any philosophy at all in the proper sense of the term. Thus Professor  Frank Thilly of the Cornell University says in his _History of Philosophy_  [Footnote ref 1], \"A universal history of philosophy would include  the philosophies of all peoples. Not all peoples, however    __________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: New York, 1914, p. 3.]    4    have produced real systems of thought, and the speculations of only a  few can be said to have had a history. Many do not rise beyond the  mythological stage. Even the theories of Oriental peoples, the Hindus,  Egyptians, Chinese, consist, in the main, of mythological and ethical  doctrines, and are not thoroughgoing systems of thought: they are shot  through with poetry and faith. We shall, therefore, limit ourselves to  the study of the Western countries, and begin with the philosophy of the  ancient Greeks, on whose culture our own civilization in part, rests.\"  There are doubtless many other people who hold such uninformed and  untrue beliefs, which only show their ignorance of Indian matters.  It is not necessary to say anything in order to refute these views,  for what follows will I hope show the falsity of their beliefs. If  they are not satisfied, and want to know more definitely and elaborately  about the contents of the different systems, I am afraid they will have  to go to the originals referred to in the bibliographical notices of  the chapters.    There is another opinion, that the time has not yet come for an attempt  to write a history of Indian philosophy. Two different reasons are given  from two different points of view. It is said that the field of Indian  philosophy is so vast, and such a vast literature exists on each of the  systems, that it is not possible for anyone to collect his materials  directly from the original sources, before separate accounts are prepared  by specialists working in each of the particular systems. There is some  truth in this objection, but although in some of the important systems  the literature that exists is exceedingly vast, yet many of them are more  or less repetitions of the same subjects, and a judicious selection of  twenty or thirty important works on each of the systems could certainly  be made, which would give a fairly correct exposition. In my own  undertaking in this direction I have always drawn directly from the  original texts, and have always tried to collect my materials from those  sources in which they appear at their best. My space has been very limited  and I have chosen the features which appeared to me to be the most  important. I had to leave out many discussions of difficult problems  and diverse important bearings of each of the systems to many  interesting aspects of philosophy. This I hope may be excused  in a history of philosophy which does not aim at completeness.  There are indeed many defects and shortcomings, and    5    these would have been much less in the case of a writer abler than the  present one. At any rate it may be hoped that the imperfections of the  present attempt will be a stimulus to those whose better and more  competent efforts will supersede it. No attempt ought to be called  impossible on account of its imperfections.    In the second place it is said that the Indians had no proper and  accurate historical records and biographies and it is therefore impossible  to write a history of Indian philosophy. This objection is also partially  valid. But this defect does not affect us so much as one would at first  sight suppose; for, though the dates of the earlier beginnings are very  obscure, yet, in later times, we are in a position to affirm some dates  and to point out priority and posteriority in the case of other thinkers.  As most of the systems developed side by side through many centuries their  mutual relations also developed, and these could be well observed. The  special nature of this development has been touched on in the fourth  chapter. Most of the systems had very early beginnings and a continuous  course of development through the succeeding centuries, and it is not  possible to take the state of the philosophy of a particular system at  a particular time and contrast it with the state of that system at a  later time; for the later state did not supersede the previous state,  but only showed a more coherent form of it, which was generally true to  the original system but was more determinate. Evolution through history  has in Western countries often brought forth the development of more  coherent types of philosophic thought, but in India, though the types  remained the same, their development through history made them more and  more coherent and determinate. Most of the parts were probably existent  in the earlier stages, but they were in an undifferentiated state; through  the criticism and conflict of the different schools existing side by side  the parts of each of the systems of thought became more and more  differentiated, determinate, and coherent. In some cases this development  has been almost imperceptible, and in many cases the earlier forms have  been lost, or so inadequately expressed that nothing definite could be  made out of them. Wherever such a differentiation could be made  in the interests of philosophy, I have tried to do it. But I  have never considered it desirable that the philosophical interest  should be subordinated to the chronological. It is no    6    doubt true that more definite chronological information would be  a very desirable thing, yet I am of opinion that the little  chronological data "]]]
