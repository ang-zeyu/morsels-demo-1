Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.      Supper is done, and we shall come too late.      Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives      Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,      Shall bitterly begin his fearful date      With this night's revels and expire the term      Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,      By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

Capulet's house.    Servingmen come forth with napkins.      1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?      He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!    2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's      hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.    1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,      look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as      thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and  Nell.      Anthony, and Potpan!    2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.    1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and      sought for, in the great chamber.    3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!      Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.        Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,                Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests                 and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.        Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes      Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.      Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all      Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,      She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?      Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day      That I have worn a visor and could tell      A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,      Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!      You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.      A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.                                      Music plays, and they dance.      More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,      And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.      Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.      Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,      For you and I are past our dancing days.      How long is't now since last yourself and I      Were in a mask?    2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.      Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!      'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,      Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,      Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.    2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;      His son is thirty.      Cap. Will you tell me that?      His son was but a ward two years ago.      Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the      hand Of yonder knight?      Serv. I know not, sir.      Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!      It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night      Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-      Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!      So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows      As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.      The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand      And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.      Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!      For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.      Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.      Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave      Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,      To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?      Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,      To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.      Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?      Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;      A villain, that is hither come in spite      To scorn at our solemnity this night.      Cap. Young Romeo is it?      Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.      Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.      'A bears him like a portly gentleman,      And, to say truth, Verona brags of him      To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.      I would not for the wealth of all this town      Here in my house do him disparagement.      Therefore be patient, take no note of him.      It is my will; the which if thou respect,      Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,      An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.      Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.      I'll not endure him.      Cap. He shall be endur'd.      What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!      Am I the master here, or you? Go to!      You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!      You'll make a mutiny among my guests!      You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!      Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.      Cap. Go to, go to!      You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?      This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.      You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-      Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!      Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!      I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!      Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting      Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.      I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,      Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.      Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.      Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,      Which mannerly devotion shows in this;      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,      And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.      Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?      Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.      Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!      They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.      Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.      Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.      Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]      Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.      Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!      Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]      Jul. You kiss by th' book.      Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.      Rom. What is her mother?      Nurse. Marry, bachelor,      Her mother is the lady of the house.      And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.      I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.      I tell you, he that can lay hold of her      Shall have the chinks.      Rom. Is she a Capulet?      O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.      Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.      Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.      Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;      We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.      Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.      I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.      More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.      Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;      I'll to my rest.                                Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].      Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?      Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.      Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?      Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.      Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?      Nurse. I know not.      Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,      My grave is like to be my wedding bed.      Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,      The only son of your great enemy.      Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!      Prodigious birth of love it is to me      That I must love a loathed enemy.      Nurse. What's this? what's this?      Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now      Of one I danc'd withal.                                       One calls within, 'Juliet.'      Nurse. Anon, anon!      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.          PROLOGUE    Enter Chorus.        Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,      And young affection gapes to be his heir;      That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,      With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.      Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,      Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;      But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,      And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.      Being held a foe, he may not have access      To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,      And she as much in love, her means much less      To meet her new beloved anywhere;      But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,      Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.  Exit.          ACT II. Scene I.  A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.    Enter Romeo alone.        Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?      Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.                       [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]                       Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.        Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!      Mer. He is wise,      And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.      Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.      Call, good Mercutio.      Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.      Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!      Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;      Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!

But verse is  felt to be an object for artistic molding, although here too the  naturalistic dogmas of the Storm and Stress writers, of the  Romanticists, Young Germans and Ultra-Moderns, have often shaken the  theories upon which the artistic perfection of our poetry is based.    In this regard, likewise, there was, in the seventeenth century, a  great difficulty to be overcome. Changes in language, the effect of  French and Italian style, the influence of music, had weakened the  foundations of the German art of verse, which were already partly  broken down by mechanical wear and tear. The comparatively simple  regulation contrived by an ordinary, though clever, poet, Martin  Opitz, proved capable of enduring for centuries; a connection was  established between the accent of verse and natural accent, which at  the same time, by means of more stringent rules, created barriers  against variable accent. It was merely a question of arranging the  words in such fashion that, without forming too great a contradiction  to the common-place order of words, the way in which the accents were  placed upon them should result in a regularly alternating rise and  fall. On the whole, this principle was found to be sufficient until  the enthusiasm of the new poetic generation demanded a closer  connection between the poetic form and the variable conditions of the  soul; they found a way out of the difficulty by carrying a rhythmical  mood through a variety of metrical divisions, and thus came upon the  \"free rhythms.\" From whatever source these were derived, either from  the misunderstood poems of Pindar, from the language of the Bible or  of the enthusiastic mystics, or from the poetic half-prose of the  pastoral poet Salomon Gessner, they were, in any case, something new  and peculiar, and their nature has not been grasped in the least  degree by the French in their \"vers libres,\" or at any rate only since  the half-Germanic Fleming Verhaeren. They received an interesting  development through Goethe and Heinrich Heine, while most of the other  poets who made use of them, even the greatest one, Novalis, often  deteriorated either into a regular, if rhymeless, versification, or  into a pathetic, formless prose.    Another method of procuring new metrical mediums of expression for the  new wealth of emotions was to borrow. Klopstock naturalized antique  metres, or rather made them familiar to the school and to cultivated  poets, while on the other hand Heine's derision of August von Platen's  set form of verse was welcomed in many circles, and even the elevated  poems of Friedrich Hoelderlin, which approached the antique form,  remained foreign to the people, like the experiments of Leconte de  Lisle in France; in Italy it fared otherwise with Carducci's _Odi  barbare_. Only one antique metre became German, in the same sense that  Shakespeare had become a German poet; this was the hexameter, alone or  in connection with the pentameter; for the ratio of its parts to one  another, on which everything depends in higher metrics, corresponded,  to some extent, to that of the German couplets. For the same reason  the sonnet--not, however, without a long and really bitter fight--was  able to win a secure place in German reflective lyric poetry; indeed  it had already been once temporarily in our possession during the  seventeenth century. Thus two important metres had been added to  German poetry's treasure house of forms: first, the hexameter for a  continuous narrative of a somewhat epic character, even though without  high solemnity--which Goethe alone once aspired to in his  _Achilleis_--and also for shorter epigrammatic or didactic  observations in the finished manner of the distich; second, the sonnet  for short mood-pictures and meditations. The era of the German  hexameter seems, however, to be over at present, while, on the  contrary, the sonnet, brought to still higher perfection by Platen,  Moritz von Strachwitz and Paul Heyse, still exercises its old power of  attraction, especially over poets with a tendency toward Romance art.  However, both hexameter or distich and sonnet have become, in Germany,  pure literary forms of composition. While in Italy the sonnet is still  sung, we are filled with astonishment that Brahms should have set to  music a distich--_Anacreon_. Numerous other forms, taken up  principally by the Romantic school and the closely related \"Exotic  School,\" have remained mere literary playthings. For a certain length  of time the ghasel seemed likely to be adopted as a shell to contain  scattered thoughts, wittily arranged, or (almost exclusively by  Platen) also for mood-pictures; but without doubt the undeservedly  great success of Friedrich von Bodenstedt's _Mirza Schaffy_ has cast  permanent discredit on this form. The favorite stanza of Schiller is  only one of the numerous strophe forms of our narrative or reflective  lyric; it has never attained an \"ethos\" peculiar to itself.  Incidentally, the French alexandrines were the fashion for a short  time after Victor Hugo's revival of them was revivified by Ferdinand  Freiligrath, and were recently used with variations by Carl Spitteler  (which, however, he denies) as a foundation for his epic poems. So,  too, the \"Old German rhymed verse\" after the manner of Hans Sachs,  enjoyed a short popularity; and one saw virtuosos playing with the  canzone or the makame. On the whole, however, German lyric poetry is  rather made up of simple formations in the style of the folk-song,  especially since the important rhythmic transformation of this  material by Heine created new possibilities for accommodating the  inner form to new subject matter without conspicuously changing the  outer form. For two great simplifying factors have, since Goethe, been  predominant in protecting our lyric poetry from unfruitful  artificiality; the influence of the folk-song and the connection with  music have kept it more full of vital energy than the too literary  lyric poetry of the French, and richer in variety than the too  cultivated lyric of the English. Whoever shut the door on the  influences spoken of, as did Franz Grillparzer or Hebbel, and, in a  different way, Annette von Droste-Huelshoff or Heinrich Leuthold, at  the same time nullified a good part of his efficiency.    The drama almost exclusively assumed a foreign, though kindred, form  as a garb for the more elevated styles of composition: namely, the  blank verse of the English stage, which Lessing's _Nathan the Wise_  had popularized and A.W. Schlegel's Shakespeare had rendered  omnipotent, and which Schiller forced upon his successors. The  Romanticists, by playing unsuccessfully with different forms, as in  Ludwig Tieck's _Octavianus_, or Immerman's _Alexis_, or by adopting  pure antique or Spanish metres, attempted in vain to free themselves  from the restraint of form, the great danger of which consisted in its  similarity to common-place sentence construction, so that the verse  ran the risk either of becoming prosaic, or else, in trying forcibly  to avoid this, of growing bombastic. An escape was provided by  inserting, in moments of emotion, a metre of a more lyrical quality  into the uniform structure of the usual vehicle of dramatic dialogue,  particularly when partaking of the nature of a monologue; as Goethe  did, for example, in the \"Song of the Fates\" in _Iphigenia_, that most  metrically perfect of all German dramatic poems, and as Schiller  continued to do with increased boldness in the songs introduced into  _Mary Stuart_. Perhaps the greatest perfection in such use of the  principle of the \"free rhythm\" as applied to the drama, was reached by  Franz Grillparzer in the _Golden Fleece_, on the model of certain  fragments by Goethe, such as the _Prometheus_. On the other hand, the  interesting experiments in the _Bride of Messina_ are of more  importance for the development of the opera into a work of art  complete in itself, than for that of the drama. In general, however,  it is to be remarked as a peculiarity of modern German drama, that it  seeks to escape from monotony, which the French classical theatre  hardly ever succeeded in avoiding, by calling in the aid of the other  arts. Plastic art is often employed for scenic arrangement, and music  to produce effects on and behind the stage. Both were made use of by  Schiller; and it was under his influence that they were tried by  Goethe in his later period--though we find a remarkable sporadic  appearance of them even as early as _Goetz_ and _Klavigo_. The mastery  which Grillparzer also attained in this respect has been striven after  by his fellow countrymen with some degree of success: as, for example,  by Ferdinand Raimund, by Ludwig Anzengruber, and also by Friedrich  Halm and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.    Besides blank verse, the only other garb in vogue for the serious  drama was prose: this was not only used for realistic pictures of  conditions of a decidedly cheerful type (since Lessing had introduced  the _bourgeois_ dramas of Diderot into Germany), but also for pathetic  tragedies, the vital power of which the lack of stylistic disguising  of language was supposed to increase. This was the form employed in  the Storm and Stress drama, and therefore in the prison scene of  _Faust_, as also in Schiller's youthful dramas, and again we find it  adopted by Hebbel and the Young Germans, and by the naturalistic  school under the leadership of Ibsen. The Old German rhymed verse  found only a temporary place between these two forms. It was glorified  and made almost sacrosanct by having been used for the greatest of our  dramas, Goethe's _Faust_; Wildenbruch in particular tried to gain new  effects with it. Other attempts also went hand in hand with  deeper-reaching efforts to reconstruct the inner form of the drama;  thus the tendency to a veiled polyphony of language in the"]]]
