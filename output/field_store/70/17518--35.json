During the stoppage in this case  the windows of the mill were a sea of heads of men and women (the  operatives), and considerable excitement was caused by the violent  blowing off of steam from the safety-valves, due to the stoppage of the  steam supply to the engine; and this excitement continued until the  cause of the stoppage was understood. Had the power in this mill been  subdivided the stoppage of one of a number of engines would scarcely  have been noticed, and the blowing off of surplus steam would not have  occurred.    In building a mill the first item to be considered is the interest on  the first cost of the engine, boilers, etc. This item can be subdivided  with advantage into the amounts of interest on the respective costs of,    _First_. The engine or engines;    _Second_ The boiler or boilers;    _Third_. The engine and boiler house.    In the same connection the _form_ of engine to be used must be  considered. In some few cases--as, for instance, where engines have to  be placed in confined situations--the form is practically fixed by the  space available, it being perhaps possible only to erect a vertical or a  horizontal engine, as the case may be. These, however, are exceptional  instances, and in most cases--at all events where large powers are  required--the engineer may have a free choice in the matter. Under  these circumstances the best form, in the vast majority of cases where  machinery must be driven, is undoubtedly the horizontal engine, and the  worst the beam engine. When properly constructed, the horizontal engine  is more durable than the beam engine, while, its first cost being less,  it can be driven at a higher speed, and it involves a much smaller  outlay for engine house and foundations than the latter. In many  respects the horizontal engine is undoubtedly closely approached in  advantages by the best forms of vertical engines; but on the whole we  consider that where machinery is to be driven the balance of advantages  is decidedly in favor of the former class, and particularly so in the  case of large powers.    The next point to be decided is, whether a condensing or non-condensing  engine should be employed. In settling this question not only the  respective first costs of the two classes of engines must be taken into  consideration, but also the cost of water and fuel. Excepting, perhaps,  in cases of very small powers, and in those instances where the exhaust  steam from a non-condensing engine can be turned to good account for  heating or drying purpose, it may safely be asserted that in all  instances where a sufficient supply of condensing water is available  at a moderate cost, the extra economy of a well-constructed condensing  engine will fully warrant the additional outlay involved in its  purchase. In these days of high steam pressures, a well constructed  non-condensing engine can, no doubt, be made to approximate closely to  the economy of a condensing engine, but in such a case the extra cost of  the stronger boiler required will go far to balance the additional cost  of the condensing engine.    Having decided on the form, the next question is, what \"class\" of engine  shall it be; and by the term class I mean the relative excellence of the  engine as a power-producing machine. An automatic engine costs more than  a plain slide-valve engine, but it will depend upon the cost of fuel at  the location where the engine is to be placed, and the number of hours  per day it is kept running, to decide which class of machine can be  adopted with the greatest economy to the proprietor. The cost of  lubricating materials, fuel, repairs, and percentage of cost to be put  aside for depreciation, will be less in case of the high-class than in  the low-class engine, while the former will also require less boiler  power.    Against these advantages are to be set the greater first cost of the  automatic engine, and the consequent annual charge due to capital sunk.  These several items should all be fairly estimated when an engine is  to be bought, and the kind chosen accordingly. Let us take the item of  fuel, for instance, and let us suppose this fuel to cost four dollars  per ton at the place where the engine is run. Suppose the engine to be  capable of developing one hundred horse-power, and that it consumes five  pounds of coal per hour per horse-power, and runs ten hours per day:  this would necessitate the supply of two and one-half tons per day at  a cost of ten dollars per day. To be really economical, therefore, any  improvement which would effect a saving of one pound of coal per hour  per horse-power must not cost a greater sum per horse-power than that on  which the cost of the difference of the coal saved (one pound of coal  per hour per horse-power, which would be 1,000 pounds per day) for, say,  three hundred days, three hundred thousand (300,000) pounds, or one  hundred and fifty tons (or six hundred dollars), would pay a fair  interest.    Assuming that the mill owner estimates his capital as worth to him ten  per cent, per annum, then the improvement which would effect the above  mentioned saving must not cost more than six thousand dollars, and so  on. If, instead of being run only ten hours per day, the engine is run  night and day, then the outlay which it would be justifiable to make to  effect a certain saving per hour would be doubled; while, on the other  hand, if an engine is run less than the usual time per day a given  saving per hour would justify a correspondingly less outlay.    It has been found that for grain and other elevators, which are not run  constantly, gas engines, although costing more for the same power,  are cheaper than steam engines for elevating purposes where only  occasionally used.    For this reason it is impossible without considerable investigation to  say what is really the most economical engine to adopt in any particular  case; and as comparatively few users of steam power care to make this  investigation a vast amount of wasteful expenditure results. Although,  however, no absolute rule can be given, we may state that the number  of instances in which an engine which is wasteful of fuel can be used  profitably is exceedingly small. As a rule, in fact, it may generally be  assumed that an engine employed for driving a manufactory of any kind  cannot be of too high a class, the saving effected by the economical  working of such engines in the vast majority of cases enormously  outweighing the interest on their extra first cost. So few people appear  to have a clear idea of the vast importance of economy of fuel in mills  and factories that I perhaps cannot better conclude than by giving an  example showing the saving to be effected in a large establishment by an  economical engine.    I will take the case of a flouring mill in this city which employed two  engines that required forty pounds of water to be converted into steam  per hour per indicated horse-power. This, at the time, was considered a  moderate amount and the engines were considered \"good.\"    These engines indicated seventy horse power each, and ran twenty-four  hours per day on an average of three hundred days each year, requiring  as per indicator diagrams forty million three hundred and twenty  thousand pounds (40 x 70 x 24 x 300 x 2 = 40,320,000) of feed water to  be evaporated per annum, which, in Philadelphia, costs three dollars  per horse-power per annum, amounting to (70 x 2 x 300 = $420.00) four  hundred and twenty dollars.    The coal consumed averaged five and one-half pounds per hour per  horse-power, which, at four dollars per ton, costs    ((70 x 2 x 5.5 x 24 x 300) / 2,000) x 4.00= $11,088    Eleven thousand and eighty-eight dollars.      Cost of coal for 300 days.                $11,088    Cost of water for 300 days.                   420                                              -------    Total cost of coal and water.             $11,503    These engines were replaced by one first-class automatic engine,  which developed one hundred and forty-two horse-power per hour with a  consumption of _three pounds_ of coal per hour per horse-power, and the  indicator diagrams showed a consumption of _thirty_ pounds of water per  hour per horse-power. Coal cost    ((142 x 3 x 24 x 300) / 2,000) x 4.00 = $6,134    Six thousand one hundred and thirty-four dollars. Water cost (142 x  3.00= $426.00) four hundred and twenty-six dollars.      Cost of coal for 300 days.                $6,134    Cost of water for 300 days.                  426                                              ------    Total cost of coal and water.             $6,560    The water evaporated in the latter case to perform the same work was  (142 x 30 x 24 x 300 = 30,672,000) thirty million six hundred and  seventy-two thousand pounds of feed water against (40,320,000) forty  million three hundred and twenty thousand pounds in the former, a saving  of (9,648,000) nine million six hundred and forty-eight thousand pounds  per annum; or,    (40,320,000 - 30,672,000) / 9,648,000 = 31.4 per cent.    --_thirty-one and four-tenths per cent_.    And a saving in coal consumption of    (11,088 - 6,134) / 4,954 = 87.5 per cent.    --_eighty-seven and one-half per cent_., or a saving in dollars and  cents of four thousand nine hundred and fifty-four dollars ($4,954).    In this city, Philadelphia, no allowance for the consumption of water is  made in the case of first class engines, such engines being charged the  same rate per annum per horse-power as an inferior engine, while,  as shown by the above example, a saving in water of _thirty-one and  four-tenths per cent_. has been attained by the employment of a  first-class engine. The builders of such engines will always give a  guarantee of their consumption of water, so that the purchaser can be  able in advance to estimate this as accurately as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8564"],[0,"Life and Travels of Mungo Park (#3)"],[1,"conjectures to have been Walet, the only large city  in that quarter.    In twenty-four days Ibn Batuta reached Mali, which it has been found  impossible to identify with any modern city. He found a haughty potentate  residing there, whose subjects paid him the greatest deference,  approaching prostrate to the throne, and casting dust upon their heads.  The trees in this neighbourhood were of immense bulk; and in the hollow  cavity of one he saw a weaver carrying on his occupation. Near this he  saw the Niger, but conjectured it to be the Nile, and supposed it to flow  by Timbuctoo, Kakaw, (Kuku), Yuwi, and thence by Nubia to Egypt.    Leo Africanus penetrated into the interior of Africa about two centuries  after Ibn Batuta. From his description, it would appear that the aspect  of Central Africa had considerably changed during this interval.  Timbuctoo was a powerful and opulent kingdom; and Gago (evidently the  Eyeo of Clapperton), and Ghinea, (probably the Jenne of Park), were  flourishing cities. The merchants of Timbuctoo were opulent, and two of  them were married to princesses. Science and literature were cultivated,  and manuscripts bore a high price. The king was wealthy, and maintained  an army of 3000 horse, and a large body of infantry. His courtiers shone  resplendent with gold; his palace, and several of the mosques, were  handsome edifices of stone; but his subjects dwelt in oval huts, formed  of stakes, clay, and reeds.    From this period till the formation of the African Association in 1788,  no certain information was obtained concerning Central Africa. While  British enterprise and courage had made most important discoveries in  every other quarter of the world, the ignorance which prevailed  concerning Africa was felt to be most discreditable. A few  public-spirited individuals, desirous of wiping away this stigma, formed  themselves into an Association, and subscribed the requisite funds for  the purpose of sending out intelligent and courageous travellers upon  this hazardous mission. The management was intrusted to a committee,  consisting of Lord Rawdon, afterwards Marquis of Hastings, Sir Joseph  Banks, the Bishop of Landaff, Mr. Beaufoy, and Mr. Stuart.    The first individual whom they employed was Mr. Ledyard, the greater part  of whose life had been spent in travelling; he had circumnavigated the  globe along with Captain Cook, and had resided for a number of years  among the American Indians. On his return he presented himself to Sir  Joseph Banks, who was at that time anxiously looking out for a fit person  to be sent out under the auspices of the Association. He immediately saw  that Ledyard was a suitable person for them, and introduced him to Mr  Beaufoy, who was much struck with his resolute and determined appearance.  When Ledyard was asked when he could be ready to depart, he replied,  \"to-morrow!\" Soon after he sailed for Alexandria, intending to proceed  from Cairo to Sennaar, and thence to traverse the breadth of the  continent. While at Cairo, he sent home some excellent observations  concerning Egypt; and announced that his next communication would be  dated from Sennaar. But tidings of his death soon after reached England.  It appeared that some delays in the starting of the caravan which he was  to have accompanied, working on his impatient and restless spirit, had  brought on a bilious distemper, to check which he had applied improper  remedies at the outset, so that the disorder cut him off in spite of the  assistance of the most skilful physicians in Cairo.    The next traveller whom the Association engaged was Mr. Lucas. When a boy,  he had been sent to Cadiz, to be educated as a merchant. On his return he  was taken prisoner by a Sallee rover, and remained three years in  captivity at Morocco. He was afterwards appointed vice-consul at Morocco,  and spent there sixteen years, during which he acquired a great knowledge  of the chief African languages. On his return to England, he was made  oriental interpreter to the British court. Upon his expressing a desire  to set out on a journey in furtherance of the objects of the Association,  his Majesty not only granted his request, but also promised to continue  his salary as oriental interpreter during his absence. He set out by  Tripoli, and obtained from the Bey some promise of assistance. He  likewise made an arrangement with two Shereefs, or followers of the  Prophet, whose persons are held sacred, to join a caravan with which they  travelled. He went with them as far as Mesurata; but the Arabs of the  neighbourhood being in a state of revolt, the party could obtain neither  camels nor guides. Mr. Lucas therefore returned to Tripoli without making  further efforts to penetrate into the interior. He, however, obtained  from one of the Shereefs some particulars respecting the countries to the  south of Tripoli, and a memoir from his notes was drawn up by Mr. Beaufoy,  which, though in many respects imperfect and erroneous, nevertheless  threw a little additional light upon the condition of Africa. No correct  information was obtained concerning the Niger.    Enough of knowledge, however, was possessed to show that the districts  along the Gambia, stretching into the interior, afforded the most direct  method of reaching the Niger, and the countries through which it rolled.  Accordingly this was the route taken by the next adventurer, Major  Houghton, who seemed qualified for the task by the most ardent courage,  and by a considerable acquaintance with the manners both of the Moors and  negroes during his residence as consul at Morocco, and afterwards as  fort-major at Goree. But it would appear that this gallant officer was  strikingly deficient in the prudent and calculating temper which such an  arduous journey demanded. Having set out early in 1791, he speedily  reached Medina, the residence of the king of Wooli, who gave him  information respecting the best route to Timbuctoo, and promised to  furnish him with guides. During his residence Medina was entirely  destroyed by a conflagration, and Major Houghton was forced, along with  the inhabitants, to flee into the fields, carrying with him only a few  such articles as he could hastily snatch up. Thence he journeyed on to  Bambouk, and after crossing the Faleme arrived at Ferbanna, where the  king sent a guide along with him, and likewise furnished him with money  to defray the expenses of the journey. He was imprudent enough to carry  with him a quantity of merchandise, and thereby excited the cupidity off  the natives, with whom he was engaged in constant disputes. After a  complication of difficulties, he took a northern route, intending to  penetrate through Ludamar. The last intelligence received from him was  dated from Simbing, the frontier village of this state, and was merely  comprised in the following brief note, addressed to Dr. Laidley of  Pisania:--\"Major Houghton's compliments to Dr. Laidley, is in good  health, on his way to Timbuctoo; robbed of all his goods by Fenda Bucar's  son.\" Soon after this, rumours of his death reached Pisania; but the  particulars were not known till Mr. Park's return, who brought certain  intelligence. It appeared that at Jarra he had engaged some Moorish  merchants to accompany him. They persuaded him to go to Tisheet, a place  frequented for its salt mines, without informing him that it was much out  of the direct road to Timbuctoo, intending to rob him by the way. In a  few days he suspected their treachery, and resolved to return to Jarra,  but, upon refusing to advance, he was stripped of every article, and then  deserted. He wandered about the desert, alone, and famishing, till,  utterly exhausted, he lay down under a tree and expired.    The next person who offered his services to the Association was Mungo  Park, who has acquired such celebrity by the important acquisitions which  he made to African Geography. As introductory to the narrative of his  first expedition, we present our readers with a brief sketch of his early  life.      PARK'S EARLY LIFE.    Mungo Park, the celebrated African traveller, was born at Fowlshiels,  near the town of Selkirk, on the 10th September 1771. His father was a  respectable farmer on the Duke of Buccleuch's estate; and his mother, the  daughter of a neighbouring farmer of the name of Hislop, a woman of great  good sense and prudence, who anxiously and faithfully discharged the  duties which she owed to a large family of thirteen children, of whom  Mungo, the subject of this memoir, was the seventh. Park's father died  before his son had won that renown which so honourably distinguishes his  name, though not without the satisfaction of witnessing a fair promise of  his future distinction; but his mother, after hearing with much pride of  her offspring's early achievements, had to lament his untimely fate;  consoled, however, by the recollection of his unblemished character, and  virtuous conduct, and by the thought of the legacy of fame which he had  bequeathed, not to his family alone, but to his country.    With a solicitude for the education of his children, then by no means  common among the Scottish farmers, Mr. Park hired a tutor to superintend  their education, being anxious not to leave them to such chance  instruction as they might receive before they were of a proper age for  going to school; thus shewing that he was alive to the advantage of early  habits of application and study. The boyhood of Mungo Park was not  distinguished by any marks of peculiar talent, though he appears, when  sent to Selkirk school, to have paid more than an average share of  attention to his studies. Of a thoughtful and reserved disposition, he  seldom took a share in the mirthful sports of his school-fellows. He was  fond of reading and solitude, often wandering for hours among the hills,  and along the banks of his native Yarrow. The legends of border chivalry,  many of which"]]]
