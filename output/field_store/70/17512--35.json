Periodically, a Jap plane  would drop a bomb or two-to let us know the war    was still on. They did little damage. After we had our wounded taken  care of to the best of our ability, we dared to look outside to see  the thirty-foot craters and damaged buildings near the hospital.    For the first time, I realized that I was frightened. I could have  been in one of those buildings, or walking across the areas where the  craters were.    Dee. 9, 1941: At night our medical teams returned to their individual  quarters for their first rest since the bombing exhausted and giddy. I  turned on my little radio. Although the signal was badly jammed by the  Japanese as it had been for several months, I was able to make out  that Congress had declared war on Japan at 1610 hours on December 8,  1941, (0500 hours, Dec. 9 Philippine time). Now it was OK for us to  shoot back at the Japs! But with what? I also learned that the Japs  had landed large forces in French Indochina.    I was quite sure that all commercial communications with the States  had been cut off, but I called the radio station to send a message to  my wife, Judy, a teacher at Holton Arms School in Washington, D.C.,  that I was OK.    Judy and I had arrived in Manila on July 20, 1940, after a delightful  trip from New York City through the Panama Canal on the U. S. Army  Transport Republic bound for San Francisco, and on the U.S.A.T. Grant  via Hawaii, Guam and Manila. We got to see two World's Fairs (New York  and San Francisco). It was really our honeymoon, as we had previously  been too poor to afford one.    During the six weeks we were on the high seas, history had been taking  place. Hitler's armies had blitzkrieged through Holland, Belgium and  France; the British Army had a forced evacuation from Dunkirk in an  armada of small boats. Mussolini had declared war on Britain and  France (actually stabbing France in the back while she was on her  knees). Hitler's bombers were causing havoc in England, and his  submarines were sinking many Allied ships in the Atlantic. Tojo was  vigorously continuing his \"undeclared wars\" in Manchuria and China.  Churchill said, \"We shall seek no terms; we shall ask no mercy.\"    Roosevelt, preoccupied by presidential elections, was finally becoming  aware of Hitler's threat to democracy. He called up volunteers for the  Army; he further prepared for war by agreeing to transfer many planes,  tanks and some sixty reconditioned    destroyers to Britain.    Our ships bound for the Philippines had large U.S. flags painted on  each side lighted at night. We were wary of subs as they had been busy  in the Atlantic. We were beginning to get the feeling that maybe this  would not be the \"happy honeymoon\" that we had planned. And yet, war  seemed so very \"far away.\"    December 10, 1941: Several bombings with little damage, a few wounded.  We did our best to make them comfortable. We learned that President  Quezon had departed from Camp Hay soon after the first bombing for the  Malacanong Palace in Manila. The Japanese would probably spare the  palace for their own use.    During free moments, of which there were very few, I instructed our  medics in first aid, litter drill over mountain trails, etc. I did all  of the things that I could think of in preparation for war: drew money  out of the bank; got some new field boots and field uniforms from the  clothing store, packed my bedding roll with soap, toothpaste, razor,  towels, etc., and put fresh medicines in my little black doctor's bag  given to me by Dr. Eugene Stafford, who had retired in Baguio after a  distinguished career at the Mayo Clinic. I moved my furniture to his  house for safekeeping until after the war.    I had to go over to the Japanese barracks to inspect some two-hundred  internees (civilian prisoners). They had staked out a big Japanese  flag on the ground for planes to see, for their own protection.    One of the Japanese prisoners was brought to me with a severe sore  throat. Examination showed a peritonsillar abscess. The treatment  would be to lance the abscess and let the pus out. He was the first  real live Jap that I had ever met face-to-face. I attempted to explain  his condition to him. I proceeded to cut his throat with a surgical  knife. He had considerable pain for an instant, then considerable  relief. I gave him an analgesic and a sedative. He seemed grateful,  shook my hand and said, \"Arigato vely much!\" as he bowed deeply and  departed for his bed.    Some gold-mining engineers, friends of Col. Horan, built an \"entrance  to a mine\" some thirty feet back into a hillside in the center of camp  for an air-raid shelter. It proved to be very good, but we nearly  broke a leg each time we raced a bomb down the hill to the entrance.    That night our radio told us that the Japs had made landings    at Aparri, on the north coast of Luzon, and had actually landed two  thousand soldiers at Vigan on the northwest coast. It sounded like  they had landed without any resistance. These two cities were only two  or three marching days from Baguio. Was the Rainbow war plan not  working?    News was received that Hong Kong and Wake Island had been captured.  Also, that the British battleships, HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of  Wales, had been easily sunk off the Malayan coast by Japanese planes.    We heard many unusual noises about camp, especially at night, and saw  strange lights that we thought might be signals. We became suspicious  of everything that moved in camp, especially any moving troops, until  we were sure that they were ours.    I couldn't sleep! As I lay in bed, I recalled how I'd been assigned to  Camp Hay from the Medical Regiment at Fort McKinley, near Manila. Col.  Wibb Cooper, the Philippine Dept. Surgeon, picked me out of some one  hundred medical officers because I had just enough time to do on my  tour in the Philippines, not too little, not too much medical training  and experience, just enough responsibility, personality, sociability,  etc. I was to be the only U.S. medical officer north of Fort  Stotsenberg one hundred miles to the southwest. I was to be the  nearest U.S. doctor to Japan.    Camp Hay met all my expectations: delightful wooded areas, friendly  people, a fine, well-equipped station hospital and a well-trained  staff. I was invited to the Rotary Club for dinner with the American  operators of the nearby gold mines and lumber companies in the valleys  below. They all seemed anxious to know the only U.S. doctor. Retired  Major Emil Speth, the mayor of Baguio, took me in tow and saw that I  met everyone who was important.    During three months prior to the war, General MacArthur, the  Commanding General of USAFFE, conducted a \"War School' for his general  officers at Camp Hay. During the school period, I got to meet and  visit with most of the generals and their aides-either at the hospital  or the Officers' Mess. I was their \"Medic!\"    Several weeks prior to the war, some British officers' wives from Hong  Kong arrived in Baguio, a supposedly safe place to sit out the war.  Our student generals seemed to think the \"lady limeys\" had been sent  over for their dining and dancing pleasure    at the Pines Hotel. Camp Hay was almost a perfect setting almost too  good to be true except for one thing. In May, 1941, President  Roosevelt suddenly ended our honeymoon, sending all of the Army wives  back to the States.    It was two very unhappy people standing on Pier Seven in Manila,  wondering if they would ever see each other again, if the U.S.A.T.  Washington could outmaneuver the subs in the Pacific, and if our U.S.  Army could survive a frontal attack by the Japanese.    Roosevelt must have known the war was coming. In 1937 he branded the  Japanese as \"aggressors\" in their undeclared war in China and called  for quarantine against her. The Japanese answered him by sinking the  U.S.S. Panay and machine-gunning her crew.    In the late '30s, with the world situation becoming increasingly  dangerous, Germany and Italy both arming in Europe, and Japan  increasing its manpower, Roosevelt wanted to cut the Regular Army by  51 %, the National Guard by 35% and the Reserves by 33% in order to  balance his budget. It seems he was rather naive, 'or possibly just  the politician worrying about reelection.    Gen. MacArthur, who was Chief of Staff of the Army at the time, told  Roosevelt, \"Mr. President, when the next war is lost, it will be  Roosevelt's War, not MacArthur's.\" Fortunately, MacArthur was able to  save the Army from the cuts.    In Sept, 1940, Germany, Italy and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact. In  July, 1941, Roosevelt told Gen. Marshall to draw up war plans. With  his assistants, Gen. Wedemeyer and Gen. Gerow; they concluded that  Hitler was the enemy to be stopped Japan and Italy could come later.    It was Roosevelt who said, \"In politics, nothing happens by accident!  You can bet it was planned!\"    In July, 1941, Roosevelt again placed sanctions against Japan to keep  U. S. oil, scrap iron and raw materials from reaching her shores. He  issued several executive directives which made war between the U.S.  and Japan inevitable. He froze all assets in the U.S. He closed the  Panama Canal to Japanese shipping.    In August, 1941, Roosevelt placed an embargo on all goods except food.  During the same month the United States cracked the Japanese code,  after which he knew what Tokyo was thinking,    Japan reported that \"Roosevelt's decisions had created a situation so  horribly strained that we cannot endure it much longer.\"    Tojo immediately called another million reservists to the colors.    John Costello, a British historian, said that Roosevelt received a  positive war warning on Nov. 26, and possibly as early as Nov. 6th  that war would break out on Dee. 7th. He stated, \"Roosevelt was not  only expecting war, but knew exactly when it would break out.\" Even  with the Japanese Fleet approaching Pearl Harbor,"]]]
