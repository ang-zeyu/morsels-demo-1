Robin, thus seated, proceeded to light his pipe, and call for a pint  of twopenny.    \"We have no twopenny ale,\" answered Ralph Heskett, the landlord; but  as thou find'st thy own tobacco, its like thou may'st find thine own  liquor too--it's the wont of thy country, I wot.\"    \"Shame, goodman,\" said the landlady, a blithe, bustling housewife,  hastening herself to suply the guest with liquor--\"Thou knowest well  enow what the strange man wants, and it's thy trade to be a civil man.  Thou shouldest know, that if the Scot likes a small pot, he pays a  sure penny.\"    Without taking any notice of this nuptial dialogue, the Highlander  took the flagon in his hand, and, addressing the company generally,  drank the interesting toast of \"Good markets,\" to the party assembled.    \"The better that the wind blew fewer dealers from the north,\" said one  of the farmers, and fewer Highland runts to eat up the English  meadows.\"    \"Soul of my pody, put you are wrang there, my friend,\" answered Robin,  with composure, \"it is your fat Englishmen that eat up our Scots  cattle, puir things.\"    \"I wish there was a summat to eat up their drovers,\" said another;  \"a plain Englishman canna make bread within a kenning of them.\"    \"Or an honest servant keep his master's favour, but they will come  sliding in between him and the sunshine,\" said the bailiff.    \"If these pe jokes,\" said Robin Oig, with the same composure, \"there  is ower mony jokes upon one man.\"    \"It is no joke, but downright earnest,\" said the bailiff. \"Harkye,  Mr. Robin Ogg, or whatever is your name, it's right we should tell you  that we are all of one opinion, and that is, that you, Mr. Robin Ogg,  have behaved to our friend, Mr. Harry Wakefield here, like a raff and  a blackguard.\"    \"Nae doubt, nae doubt,\" answered Robin with great composure; \"and you  are a set of very feeling judges, for whose prains or pehaviour I wad  not gae a pinch of sneeshing. If Mr. Harry Waakfelt kens where he is  wranged, he kens where he may be righted.\"    \"He speaks truth,\" said Wakefield, who had listened to what passed,  divided between the offence which he had taken at Robin's late  behaviour, and the revival of his habitual acts of friendship.    He now rose and went towards Robin, who got up from his seat as he  approached, and held out his hand.    \"That's right, Harry--go it--serve him out!\" resounded on all  sides--\"tip him the nailer--show him the mill.\"    \"Hold your peace, all of you, and be----,\" said Wakefield; and then  addressing his comrade, he took him by the extended hand, with  something alike of respect and defiance. \"Robin,\" he said, \"thou hast  used me ill enough this day; but if you mean, like a frank fellow, to  shake hands, and take a tussel for love on the sod, why I'll forgie  thee, man, and we shall be better friends than ever.\"    \"And would it not pe petter to be cooed friends without more of the  matter?\" said Robin; \"we will be much petter friendships with our  panes hale than broken.\"    Harry Wakefield dropped the hand of his friend, or rather threw it  from him.    \"I did not think I had been keeping company for three years with a  coward.\"    \"Coward belongs to none of my name,\" said Robin, whose eyes began to  kindle, but keeping the command of his temper. \"It was no coward's  legs or hands, Harry Waakfelt, that drew you out of the fords of  Fried, when you was drifting ower the place rock, and every eel in the  river expected his share of you.\"    \"And that is true enough, too,\" said the Englishman, struck by the  appeal.    \"Adzooks!\" exclaimed the bailiff--\"sure Harry Wakefield, the nattiest  lad at Whitson Tryste, Wooler Fair, Carlisle Sands, or Stagshaw Bank,  is not going to show white feather? Ah, this comes of living so long  with kilts and bonnets--men forget the use of their daddies.\"    \"I may teach you, Master Fleecebumpkin, that I have not lost the use  of mine,\" said Wakefield, and then went on. \"This will never do,  Robin. We must have a turn-up, or we shall be the talk of the country  side. I'll be d----d if I hurt thee--I'll put on the gloves gin thou  like. Come, stand forward like a man.\"    \"To pe peaten like a dog,\" said Robin; \"is there any reason in that?  If you think I have done you wrong, I'll go before your shudge, though  I neither know his law nor his language.\"    A general cry of \"No, no--no law, no lawyer! a bellyful and be  friends,\" was echoed by the bystanders.    \"But,\" continued Robin, \"if I am to fight, I have no skill to fight  like a jackanapes, with hands and nails.\"    \"How would you fight then?\" said his antagonist; \"though I am thinking  it would be hard to bring you to the scratch any how.\"    \"I would fight with proadswords, and sink point on the first plood  drawn----- like a gentlemans.\"    A loud shout of laughter followed the proposal, which indeed had  rather escaped from poor Robin's swelling heart, than been the  dictates of his sober judgment.    \"Gentleman, quotha!\" was echoed on all sides, with a shout of  unextinguishable laughter; \"a very pretty gentleman, God wot--Canst  get two swords for the gentleman to fight with, Ralph Heskett?\"    \"No, but I can send to the armoury at Carlisle, and lend them two  forks to be making shift with in the meantime.\"    \"Tush, man,\" said another, \"the bonny Scots come into the world with  the blue bonnet on their heads, and dirk and pistol at their belt.\"    \"Best send post,\" said Mr. Fleecebumpkin, \"to the squire of Corby  Castle to come and stand second to the _gentleman_.\"    In the midst of this torrent of general ridicule, the Highlander  instinctively griped beneath the folds of his plaid.    \"But it's better not,\" he said in his own language. \"A hundred curses  on the swine-eaters, who know neither decency nor civility!\"    \"Make room, the pack of you,\" he said, advancing to the door.    But his former friend interposed his sturdy bulk, and opposed his  leaving the house; and when Robin Oig attempted to make his way by  force, he hit him down on the floor, with as much ease as a boy bowls  down a nine-pin.    \"A ring, a ring!\" was now shouted, until the dark rafters, and the  hams that hung on them, trembled again, and the very platters on the  _bink_ clattered against each other. \"Well done, Harry.\"--\"Give it him  home, Harry.\"--\"Take care of him now--he sees his own blood!\"    Such were the exclamations, while the Highlander, starting from the  ground, all his coldness and caution lost in frantic rage, sprung at  his antagonist with the fury, the activity, and the vindictive purpose  of an incensed tiger-cat. But when could rage encounter science and  temper? Robin Oig again went down in the unequal contest; and as the  blow was necessarily a severe one, he lay motionless on the floor of  the kitchen. The landlady ran to offer some aid, but Mr. Fleecebumpkin  would not permit her to approach.    \"Let him alone,\" he said, \"he will come to within time, and come up to  the scratch again. He has not got half his broth yet.\"    \"He has got all I mean to give him though,\" said his antagonist, whose  heart began to relent towards his old associate; \"and I would rather by  half give the rest to yourself, Mr. Fleecebumpkin, for you pretend to  know a thing or two, and Robin had not art enough even to peel before  setting to, but fought with his plaid dangling about him.--Stand up,  Robin, my man! all friends now; and let me hear the man that will speak  a word against you, or your country, for your sake.\"    Robin Oig was still under the dominion of his passion, and eager to  renew the onset; but being withheld on the one side by the  peace-making Dame Heskett, and on the other, aware that Wakefield no  longer meant to renew the combat, his fury sunk into gloomy  sullenness.    \"Come, come, never grudge so much at it, man,\" said the brave-spirited  Englishman, with the placability of his country; \"shake hands, and we  will be better friends than ever.\"    \"Friends!\" exclaimed Robin Oig with strong emphasis--\"friends!--Never.  Look to yourself, Harry Waakfelt.\"    \"Then the curse of Cromwell on your proud Scots stomach, as the man  says in the play, and you may do your worst and be d----; for one man  can say nothing more to another after a tussel, than that he is sorry  for it.\"    On these terms the friends parted; Robin Oig drew out, in silence, a  piece of money, threw it on the table, and then left the alehouse. But  turning at the door, he shook his hand at Wakefield, pointing with his  fore-finger upwards, in a manner which might imply either a threat or  a caution. He then disappeared in the moonlight.    (_To be concluded in our next_.)         *       *       *       *       *      ARCANA OF SCIENCE.      _Sheppey_.--The isle of Sheppey is quickly giving way to the sea, and  if measures are not hereafter taken to remedy this, possibly in a  century or two hence its name may be required to be obliterated from  the map. Whole acres, with houses upon them, have been carried away in  a single storm, while clay shallows, sprinkled with sand and gravel,  which stretch a full mile beyond the verge of the cliff, over which  the sea now sweeps, demonstrate the original area of the island. From  the blue clay of which these cliffs are composed may be culled out  specimens of all the fishes, fruits, and trees, which abounded in  Britain before the birth of Noah; and the traveller may consequently  handle fish which swam, and fruit which grew, in the days of the  antediluvians, all now converted into sound stone, by the petrifying  qualities of the soil in which they are imbedded. Here are lobsters,  crabs, and nautili, presenting almost the same reality as those we now  see crawling and floating about; branches of trees, too, in as perfect  order as when lopped from their parent stems; and trunks of them,  twelve feet in length and two or three diameter, fit, in all  appearance, for the operations of the saw, with great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11378"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The space thus obtained is  filled with lighted fuel, till the bottom and sides become red hot  within. The embers of the wood are then removed, the leg or foot of the  rhinoceros introduced, and the door closed up with heated clay and  embers. Fire is also made on the outside over the nests, and the flesh  is allowed to remain in it several hours. Food cooked in this way is  highly relished by all the tribes.    EASTERN DIVORCES.    If a man pronounce three divorces against a free woman, or two against a  slave, he can lawfully wed neither of them again, unless they have been  espoused by another, and this second husband dies, or shall divorce  them. When it happens that a husband wishes to recover his wife, whom he  had divorced in a passion, a convenient husband is sought; but the law  forbids a mockery being made of such marriages. They may be short in  duration, but the parties must live, during the period they are united,  as man and wife.    ARAB CHARACTER.    The Arabs have always been commended by the ancients for the fidelity of  their attachments, and they are still scrupulously exact to their words,  and respectful to their kindred; they have been universally celebrated  for their quickness of apprehension and penetration, and the vivacity of  their wit. Their language is certainly one of the most ancient in the  world; but it has many dialects. The Arabs, however, have their vices  and defects. They are naturally addicted to war; and so vindictive as  scarcely ever to forget an injury. Select Biography.    No. LIX.    GENERAL FOY.    The military career of this hero was one of singular activity. Foy was  born in 1775, and educated in the military school of La Fere, and made  sub-lieutenant of artillery in 1792. He was present at the battles of  Valmy and Jemappe, and in 1793 obtained a company--promotion was rapid  in those days. In all the subsequent campaigns he was actively employed  under Dumourier, Pichegru, Moreau, Massena, &c. In 1803, he was colonel  of the 5th regiment of horse artillery, and refused, from political  principles, the appointment of aide-de-camp on Napoleon's assumption of  the imperial throne; but was still employed, and shared in the victories  of the short but brilliant campaign of Germany in 1804. In 1806 he  commanded the artillery of the army stationed in Friuli, for the purpose  of occupying the Venetian territory incorporated by the treaty of  Presburg with the kingdom of Italy. In 1807 he was sent to  Constantinople to introduce European tactics in the Turkish service--but  this object was defeated by the death of Selim, and the opposition of  the Janissaries. On Foy's return, the expedition against Portugal was  preparing, and he received a command in the artillery under Junot,  during the occupation of Portugal, and filled the post of inspector of  forts and fortresses. He was severely wounded at the battle of Vimiera.  On the capitulation he returned to France, and with the same army  proceeded to Spain; and, subsequently, under the command of Soult, again  went into Portugal. When commanded to summon the Bishop of Oporto to  open its gates, he was seized and stript by the populace, and thrown  into prison, and escaped with difficulty. The same year he was made  general of brigade. In 1810, he made a skilful retreat at the head of  600 men, in the face of 6,000 Spaniards, across the Sierra de Caceres;  and at the head of his brigade was wounded in the battle of Busaco.  Early in 1811 he was selected by Massena to convey to the emperor the  critical state of the French army before the lines of Torres Vedras.  This commission, though one of great peril--the country being in a  complete state of insurrection--he successfully accomplished, and  brought back the emperor's instructions, for which service he was made  general of division. In July 1812, Foy was in the battle of Salamanca,  and was one of those who, when Lord Wellington raised the siege of  Burgos and retreated to the Douro, hung upon his rear, and took some  prisoners and artillery.    On the news of the disasters in Russia, and Lord Wellington's consequent  resumption of offensive movements, Foy was sent with his division beyond  Vittoria to keep the different parties in check; and after the battle of  Vittoria, at which he was not present, he collected at Bergana 20,000  troops, of different divisions, and had some success in skirmishes with  the Spanish corps forming the left wing of the allied army. He arrived  at Tolosa about the same time with Lord Lynedoch, and after a sanguinary  contest in that town, retreated upon Irun--from which he was quickly  dislodged, and finally recrossed the Bidassao. In the affair of the  passage of the Nive, on the 9th of December, 1813, and the battle of St.  Pierre d'Irrube on the 13th, Foy distinguished himself, and in the hard  fought battle of Orthez, on the 27th of February, 1814, he was left  apparently dead on the field. Before this period be had been made count  of the empire, and commander of the legion of honour. In March 1815, he  was appointed inspector general of the fourteenth military division; but  on the return of Napoleon, during the 100 days, he embraced the cause of  the emperor, and commanded a division of infantry in the battles of  Ligny and Waterloo, at the last of which he received his fifteenth  wound. This terminated his military career. In 1819, he was elected a  member of the Chamber of Deputies, the duties of which he discharged  till his death in November 1825; and from his first entrance into the  chamber, was distinguished for his eloquence, and quickly became the  acknowledged leader of the opposition--_From Foy's History of the  Peninsular War._               *       *       *       *       *    ARCANA OF SCIENCE _Museum of Natural History._    There is now exhibiting in one of the Saloons of \"The Egyptian Hall,\" in  Piccadilly, an interesting collection of zoological rarities, stated to  have been assembled by M. Villet, at the Cape of Good Hope. Some of the  specimens, especially the birds, are really beautiful; none but the  smallest being cooped up in glazed cases; but many are effectively  placed on branches of trees, whilst the quadrupeds are arranged with  still better taste. Among the latter is a fine Hippopotamus, the  Behemoth of Scripture. We are happy to hear this exhibition has already  been numerously visited, since it augurs well of public taste and  intellectual curiosity.    _Conchology._    Akin to the preceding exhibition in its claim to popular attention, may  be noticed a pleasing collection of shells, now open to the public, a  short distance from Somerset House. To the mere tyro in zoology, shells  are attractive as the elegant sports of nature, in the beauty,  splendour, and intricacy of their colours and structure; while their  scientific arrangement is one of the most delightful pursuits of refined  minds.    _Grafting._    The quince, used as a stock, has the property of stunting the growth of  pears, of forcing them to produce bearing branches, instead of sterile  ones, and of accelerating the maturity of the fruit.    _Sirocco Wind._    The depressing effects of the corroding wind of a hot Sirocco can only  be conceived by those who have suffered from them; the unwonted dulness  with which it overcasts even the most active mind; the deep-drawn sighs  it will elicit; and if there be one melancholy feeling which presses on  the heart more heavily than another, it is the ample developement which  it enjoys during the prevalence of this enervating breeze. It seldom,  however, blows with force; it is rather an exhalation than a wind. It  scarcely moves the leaves around the traveller, but it sinks heavily and  damply in his heart. A stranger is at first unaware of the cause of the  mental misery he endures; his temper sours as his spirits sink; every  person, and every circumstance, annoys him; it affects even his dreams;  sleep itself is not a refuge from querulous peevishness, and every  motion is an irritating exertion.    _Polar Expedition._    The government of the United States has appointed an expedition, under  Capt. Reynolds, to explore the northern coasts. A Captain Cunningham is  mentioned to have traversed the country from St. Louis in the Missouri,  to St. Diego, St. Pedro, in California.    _Lithography._    From an article which has appeared in a late number of the \"Biblioteca  Italiana,\" it appears that Sermefelder was not the original discoverer  of the art of Lithography, but Simon Schmidt, a professor at the Cadet  Hospital at Munich.    _Small Pox._    Within the last twelve months, only 503 deaths have occurred from small  pox within the Bills of Mortality; whereas, in the preceding year 1299  persons are recorded as having fallen victims to that loathsome  disease.--_Vaccine Institut. Report._    _China_.    A valuable museum of the products of Chinese skill and industry has  recently been exhibited at Rome, in which the progress made by a people  of whom so little is known, and civilization and the arts, is  demonstrated. The manufacture of bronzes, porcelain, gold work, and  casts in copper, has arrived in China at an approach to perfection which  the most advanced European nations would find it difficult to surpass.  Some of the Chinese vases may really be compared to those of the finest  time of Greece. The sculptures and the paintings, even with reference to  anatomical precision, are as highly finished as ours.--_Literary  Gazette_.    _Recovery from Suspended Animation_.
