[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#3)"],[1,"===============================    Plan of the Work.    This Manual is prepared to partially meet this want in deliberative  assemblies that are not legislative in their character.  It has been  made sufficiently complete to answer for the rules of an assembly, until  they see fit to adopt special rules conflicting with and superseding any  of its rules of detail, such as the Order of Business [Sec. 44], etc.  Even  in matters of detail the practice of Congress is followed, wherever it  is not manifestly unsuited to ordinary assemblies, and in such cases, in  Part I, there will be found, in a foot note, the Congressional practice.  In the important matters referred to above, in which the practice of the  House of    === Page 13 ============================================================    Representatives settles the common parliamentary law of the country,  this Manual strictly conforms to such practice.* [On account of the  party lines being so strictly drawn in Congress, no such thing as  harmony of action is possible, and it has been found best to give a bare  majority in the House of Representatives (but not in the Senate) the  power to take final action upon a question without allowing of any  discussion.  In ordinary societies more regard should be paid to the  rights of the minority, and a two-thirds vote be required, as in this  Manual [Sec. 39], for sustaining an objection to the introduction of a  question, or for adopting a motion for the Previous Question, or for  adopting an order closing or limiting debate.  In this respect the  policy of the Pocket Manual is a mean between those of the House and  Senate.  But some societies will doubtless find it advantageous to  follow the practice of the H. R., and others will prefer that of the  Senate.  It requires a majority, according to the Pocket Manual, to  order the yeas and nays, which is doubtless best in the majority of  assemblies; but in all bodies in which the members are responsible to  their constituents, a much smaller number should have this power.  In  Congress it requires but a one-fifth vote, and in some bodies a single  member can require a vote to be taken by yeas and nays.  Any society  adopting this Manual, should make its rules govern them in all cases to  which they are applicable, and in which they are not inconsistent with  the By-Laws and Rules of Order of the society.  Their own rules should  include all of the cases where it is desirable to vary from the rules in  the Manual, and especially should provide for a Quorum [Sec. 43], and an  Order of Business [Sec. 44], as suggested in these rules.]    The Manual is divided into two distinct parts, each complete in itself.  [The table at the end contains a large amount of information in a  tabular form, for easy reference in the midst of the business of a  meeting.]    Part I contains a set of Rules of Order systematically arranged, as  shown in the Table of Contents.  Each one of the forty-five sections is  complete in itself, so that no one unfamiliar with the work can be  misled in examining any particular subject.  Cross references are freely  used to save repeating    === Page 14 ============================================================    from other sections, and by this means the reader, without using the  index, is referred to everything in the Rules of Order that has any  bearing upon the subject he is investigating.  The references are by  sections, and for convenience the numbers of the sections are placed at  the top of each page.  The motions are arranged under the usual classes,  in their order of rank, but in the index under the word motion will be  found an alphabetical list of all the motions generally used.  In  reference to each motion there is stated:      (1) Of what motions it takes precedence (that is, what motions may,        be pending, and yet it be in order to make this motion).    (2) To what motions it yields (that is, what motions may be made        while this motion is pending).    (3) Whether it is debatable or not.    (4) Whether it can be amended or not.    (5) In case the motion can have no subsidiary motion applied to it,        the fact is stated [see Adjourn, Sec. 11, for an example:  the        meaning is, that the particular motion to adjourn, for example,        cannot be laid on the table, postponed, committed or amended].    (6) The effect of the motion if adopted.    (7) The form of stating the question when peculiar, and whatever other        information is necessary to enable one to understand the question.    Part II.  While the second part covers the entire ground of the first  part, it does so in a much simpler manner, being intended for those who  have    === Page 15 ============================================================    no acquaintance with the usages of deliberative assemblies.  It also  explains the method of organizing an assembly or society, and conducting  a meeting.  The motions are treated on an entirely different plan, being  classified according to the objects for which they are used, and those  of each class compared together so that the reader may obtain the best  motion for the accomplishment of any given object.  It omits the  complications of parliamentary law, and has but few references to the  rules of Congress, or those in this Manual.  In order to make it  complete in itself, it was necessary to repeat a few pages from the  first part.    Definitions.    In addition to the terms defined above (taking precedence of, yielding  to and applying to, see p. 14), there are other terms that are liable to  be misunderstood, to which attention should he called.    Meeting and Session.--In this Manual the term \"meeting\" is used to  denote an assembling together of the members of a deliberative assembly  for any length of time, during which there is no separation of the  members by adjournment.  An adjournment to meet again at some other  time, even the same day, terminates the meeting, but not the session,  which latter includes all the adjourned meetings.  The next meeting, in  this case, would be an \"adjourned meeting\" of the same session.    A \"meeting\" of an assembly is terminated by a    === Page 16 ============================================================    temporary adjournment; a \"session\" of an assembly ends with an  adjournment without day, and may consist of many meetings [see Session,  Sec. 42].    Previous Question--This term is frequently understood to refer to the  question previously under consideration.  As used in this country it is  equivalent to a motion to \"Stop debate, and proceed to voting on all the  questions before the assembly,\" with certain exceptions, where it  affects only one motion (as to postpone, to reconsider and an appeal;  see Sec. 20 for a full explanation).    Shall the Question be Considered (or discussed)?  This question, which  is put as soon as a subject is brought before an assembly, if any member  \"objects to its consideration\" (or \"discussion,\" or \"introduction\"), is  not intended to merely cut off debate, but to prevent the question from  coming before the assembly for its action.  If decided by a two-thirds  vote in the negative, the question is removed from before the assembly  immediately [see Sec. 15].    Whenever the word \"assembly,\" which is used throughout these rules,  occurs in forms of motions (as in Appeals, Sec. 14), it is better to  replace it by the special term used to designate the particular  assembly; as for instance, \"Society,\" or \"Convention,\" or \"Board.\"  The  term \"Congress,\" when used in this Manual, refers to the House of  Representatives of the U.S.    === Page 17 ============================================================    Part I.    Rules of Order.    ---    Art. I. Introduction of Business.  [Sec.Sec. 1-5.]    1. All business should be brought before the assembly by a motion of a  member, or by the presentation of a communication to the assembly.  It  is not usual, however, to make a motion to receive the reports of  committees [Sec. 30] or communications to the assembly; and in many other  cases in the ordinary routine of business, the formality of a motion is  dispensed with; but should any member object, a regular motion becomes  necessary.    2. Before a member can make a motion or address the assembly upon any  question, it is necessary that he obtain the floor; that is, he must  rise and address the presiding officer    === Page 18 ============================================================    by his title, thus:  \"Mr. Chairman\" [Sec. 34], who will then announce the  member's name.  Where two or more rise at the same time the Chairman  must decide who is entitled to the floor, which he does by announcing  that member's name.  From this decision, however, an appeal [Sec. 14] can  he taken; though if there is any doubt as to who is entitled to the  floor, the Chairman can at the first allow the assembly to decide the  question by a vote--the one getting the largest vote being entitled to  the floor.    The member upon whose motion the subject under discussion was brought  before the assembly (or, in case of a committee's report, the one who  presented the report) is entitled to be recognized as having the floor  (if he has not already had it during that discussion), notwithstanding  another member may have first risen and addressed the Chair.  If the  Chairman rise to speak before the floor has been assigned to any one, it  is the duty of a member who may have previously risen to take his seat.  [See Decorum in Debate, Sec. 36.]    When a member has obtained the floor, he cannot be cut off from  addressing the assembly, nor be interrupted in this speech by a    === Page 19 ============================================================    motion to adjourn, or for any purpose, by either the Chairman or any  member, except (a) to have entered on the minutes a motion to reconsider  [Sec. 27]; (b) by a call to order [Sec. 14]; (c)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#3)"],[1,"yonet, broke up  the camp, capturing both the generals and half the artillery. Though  the assailants, who lost 220 of their small number, suffered much  more than the Americans, yet the latter were completely demoralized,  and at once retreated to Fort George. Soon afterward, Col. Boerstler  with about 600 men surrendered with shamefully brief resistance to  a somewhat smaller force of British and Indians. Then about 300  British crossed the Niagara to attack Black Rock, which they took,  but were afterward driven off by a large body of militia with the  loss of 40 men. Later in the season the American General McClure  wantonly burned the village of Newark, and then retreated in panic  flight across the Niagara. In retaliation the British in turn crossed  the river; 600 regulars surprised and captured in the night Fort  Niagara, with its garrison of 400 men; two thousand troops attacked  Black Rock, and after losing over a hundred men in a smart engagement  with somewhat over 1,500 militia whom they easily dispersed, captured  and burned both it and Buffalo. Before these last events took place  another invasion of Canada had been attempted, this time under General  Wilkinson, \"an unprincipled imbecile,\" as Scott very properly  styled him. It was mismanaged in every possible way, and was a  total failure; it was attended with but one battle, that of Chrystler's  Farm, in which 1,000 British, with the loss of less than 200 men,  beat back double their number of Americans, who lost nearly 500 men  and also one piece of artillery. The American army near Lake  Champlain had done nothing, its commander, General Wade Hampton,  being, if possible, even more incompetent than Wilkinson. He remained  stationary while a small force of British plundered Plattsburg and  Burlington; then, with 5,000 men he crossed into Canada, but returned  almost immediately, after a small skirmish at Chauteaugay between  his advance guard and some 500 Canadians, in which the former lost  41 and the latter 22 men. This affair, in which hardly a tenth of  the American force was engaged, has been, absurdly enough, designated  a \"battle\" by most British and Canadian historians. In reality it  was the incompetency of their general and not the valor of their  foes that caused the retreat of the Americans. The same comment,  by the way, applies to the so-called \"Battle\" of Plattsburg, in the  following year, which may have been lost by Sir George Prevost, but  was certainly not won by the Americans. And, again, a similar  criticism should be passed on General Wilkinson's attack on La  Colle Mill, near the head of the same lake. Neither one of the  three affairs was a stand-up fight; in each a greatly superior  force, led by an utterly incapable general, retreated after a slight  skirmish with an enemy whose rout would have been a matter of  certainty had the engagement been permitted to grow serious.    In the early spring of 1814 a small force of 160 American regulars,  under Captain Holmes, fighting from behind felled logs, routed 200  British with a loss of 65 men, they themselves losing but 8. On  Lake Ontario the British made a descent on Oswego and took it by  fair assault; and afterward lost 180 men who tried to cut out some  American transports, and were killed or captured to a man. All  through the spring and early summer the army on the Niagara frontier  was carefully drilled by Brown, and more especially by Scott, and  the results of this drilling were seen in the immensely improved  effectiveness of the soldiers in the campaign that opened in July.  Fort Erie was captured with little resistance, and on the 4th of  July, at the river Chippeway, Brown, with two brigades of regulars,  each about 1,200 strong, under Scott and Ripley, and a brigade of  800 militia and Indians under Porter, making a total of about 3,200  men, won a stand-up fight against the British General Riall, who  had nearly 2,500 men, 1,800 of them regulars. Porter's brigade  opened by driving in the Canadian militia and the Indians; but was  itself checked by the British light-troops. Ripley's brigade took  very little part in the battle, three of the regiments not being  engaged at all, and the fourth so slightly as to lose but five men.  The entire brunt of the action was borne by Scott's brigade, which  was fiercely attacked by the bulk of the British regulars under  Riall. The latter advanced with great bravery, but were terribly  cut up by the fire of Scott's regulars; and when they had come  nearly up to him, Scott charged with the bayonet and drove them  clean off the field. The American loss was 322, including 23 Indians;  the British loss was 515, excluding that of the Indians. The number  of Americans actually engaged did not exceed that of the British;  and Scott's brigade, in fair fight, closed by a bayonet charge,  defeated an equal force of British regulars.    On July 25th occurred the Battle of Niagara, or Lundy's Lane, fought  between General Brown with 3,100 [Footnote: As near as can be found  out; most American authorities make it much less; Lossing, for  example, says only 2,400.] Americans and General Drummond with  3,500 [Footnote: General Drummond in his official letter makes it  but 2,800; James, who gives the details, makes it 3,000 rank and  file; adding 13 per cent, for the officers, sergeants, and drummers,  brings it up to 3,400; and we still have to count in the artillery  drivers, etc.] British. It was brought on by accident in the evening,  and was waged with obstinate courage and savage slaughter till  midnight. On both sides the forces straggled into action by  detachments. The Americans formed the attacking party. As before,  Scott's brigade bore the brunt of the fight, and over half of his  men were killed or wounded; he himself was disabled and borne from  the field. The struggle was of the most desperate character, the  combatants showing a stubborn courage that could not be surpassed.  [Footnote: General Drummond writes: \"In so determined a manner were  their attacks directed against our guns that our artillerymen were  bayoneted while in the act of loading, and the muzzle of the enemy's  guns were advanced within a few yards of ours.\" Even James says:  \"Upon the whole, however, the American troops fought bravely; and the  conduct of many of the officers, of the artillery corps especially,  would have done honor to any service.\"] Charge after charge was made  with the bayonet, and the artillery was taken and retaken once and  again. The loss was nearly equal; on the side of the Americans,  854 men (including Generals Brown and Scott, wounded) and two guns;  on that of the British, 878 men (including General Riall captured)  and one gun. Each side claimed it as a victory over superior numbers.  The truth is beyond question that the British had the advantage in  numbers, and a still greater advantage in position; while it is  equally beyond question that it was a defeat and not a victory for  the Americans. They left the field and retired in perfect order to  Fort Erie, while the British held the field and the next day pursued  their foes.    Having received some reinforcements General Drummond, now with  about 3,600 men, pushed forward to besiege Fort Erie, in which was  the American army, some 2,400 strong, under General Gaines. Col.  Tucker with 500 British regulars was sent across the Niagara to  destroy the batteries at Black Rock, but was defeated by 300  American regulars under Major Morgan, fighting from behind a strong  breastwork of felled trees, with a creek in front. On the night of  the 15th of August, the British in three columns advanced to storm  the American works, but after making a most determined assault  were beaten off. The assailants lost 900 men, the assailed about  80. After this nothing was done till Sept. 17th, when General  Brown, who had resumed command of the American forces, determined  upon and executed a sortie. Each side had received reinforcements;  the Americans numbered over 3,000, the British nearly 4,000. The  fighting was severe, the Americans losing 500 men; but their  opponents lost 600 men, and most of their batteries were destroyed.  Each side, as usual, claimed the victory; but, exactly as Lundy's  Lane must be accounted an American defeat, as our forces retreated  from the ground, so this must be considered an American victory,  for after it the British broke up camp and drew off to Chippeway.  Nothing more was done, and on November 5th the American army  recrossed the Niagara. Though marked by some brilliant feats of  arms this four months' invasion of Canada, like those that had  preceded it, thus came to nothing. But at the same time a British  invasion of the United States was repulsed far more disgracefully.  Sir George Prevost, with an army of 13,000 veteran troops, marched  south along the shores of Lake Champlain to Plattsburg, which was  held by General Macomb with 2,000 regulars, and perhaps double  that number of nearly worthless militia;--a force that the British  could have scattered to the winds, though, as they were strongly  posted, not without severe loss. But the British fleet was captured  by Commodore MacDonough in the fight on the lake; and then Sir George,  after some heavy skirmishing between the outposts of the armies, in  which the Americans had the advantage, fled precipitately back to  Canada.    All through the war the sea-coasts of the United States had been  harried by small predatory excursions; a part of what is now the  State of Maine was conquered with little resistance, and kept until  the close of hostilities; and some of the towns on the shores of  Chesapeake Bay had been plundered or burnt. In August, 1814, a more  serious invasion was planned, and some 5,000 troops--regulars,  sailors, and marines--were landed, under the command of General  Ross. So utterly helpless was the Democratic Administration at  Washington, that during the two years of"]]]
