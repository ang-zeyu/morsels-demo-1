He had begun from AEthiopia, descended into Egypt,  and passed over great part of the royal territory.  Well it was that  he stopped there.  When I left him, he was burying the miserable  Athenians at Nisibis; but as I knew what he was going to tell us, I  took my leave of him.    Another thing very common with these historians is, by way of  imitating Thucydides, to make use of his phrases, perhaps with a  little alteration, to adopt his manner, in little modes and  expressions, such as, \"you must yourself acknowledge,\" \"for the same  reason,\" \"a little more, and I had forgot,\" and the like.  This same  writer, when he has occasion to mention bridges, fosses, or any of  the machines used in war, gives them Roman names; but how does it  suit the dignity of history, or resemble Thucydides, to mix the  Attic and Italian thus, as if it was ornamental and becoming?    Another of them gives us a plain simple journal of everything that  was done, such as a common soldier might have written, or a sutler  who followed the camp.  This, however, was tolerable, because it  pretended to nothing more; and might be useful by supplying  materials for some better historian.  I only blame him for his  pompous introduction:  \"Callimorphus, physician to the sixth legion  of spearmen, his history of the Parthian war.\"  Then his books are  all carefully numbered, and he entertains us with a most frigid  preface, which he concludes with saying that \"a physician must be  the fittest of all men to write history, because AEsculapius was the  son of Apollo, and Apollo is the leader of the Muses, and the great  prince of literature.\"    Besides this, after setting out in delicate Ionic, he drops, I know  not how, into the most vulgar style and expressions, used only by  the very dregs of the people.    And here I must not pass over a certain wise man, whose name,  however, I shall not mention; his work is lately published at  Corinth, and is beyond everything one could have conceived.  In the  very first sentence of his preface he takes his readers to task, and  convinces them by the most sagacious method of reasoning that \"none  but a wise man should ever attempt to write history.\"  Then comes  syllogism upon syllogism; every kind of argument is by turns made  use of, to introduce the meanest and most fulsome adulation; and  even this is brought in by syllogism and interrogation.  What  appeared to me the most intolerable and unbecoming the long beard of  a philosopher, was his saying in the preface that our emperor was  above all men most happy, whose actions even philosophers did not  disdain to celebrate; surely this, if it ought to be said at all,  should have been left for us to say rather than himself.    Neither must we here forget that historian who begins thus:  \"I come  to speak of the Romans and Persians;\" and a little after he says,  \"for the Persians ought to suffer;\" and in another place, \"there was  one Osroes, whom the Greeks call Oxyrrhoes,\" with many things of  this kind.  This man is just such a one as him I mentioned before,  only that one is like Thucydides, and the other the exact  resemblance of Herodotus.    But there is yet another writer, renowned for eloquence, another  Thucydides, or rather superior to him, who most elaborately  describes every city, mountain, field, and river, and cries out with  all his might, \"May the great averter of evil turn it all on our  enemies!\"  This is colder than Caspian snow, or Celtic ice.  The  emperor's shield takes up a whole book to describe.  The Gorgon's  {35} eyes are blue, and black, and white; the serpents twine about  his hair, and his belt has all the colours of the rainbow.  How many  thousand lines does it cost him to describe Vologesus's breeches and  his horse's bridle, and how Osroes' hair looked when he swam over  the Tigris, what sort of a cave he fled into, and how it was shaded  all over with ivy, and myrtle, and laurel, twined together.  You  plainly see how necessary this was to the history, and that we could  not possibly have understood what was going forward without it.    From inability, and ignorance of everything useful, these men are  driven to descriptions of countries and caverns, and when they come  into a multiplicity of great and momentous affairs, are utterly at a  loss.  Like a servant enriched on a sudden by coming into his  master's estate, who does not know how to put on his clothes, or to  eat as he should do; but when fine birds, fat sows, and hares are  placed before him, falls to and eats till he bursts, of salt meat  and pottage.  The writer I just now mentioned describes the  strangest wounds, and the most extraordinary deaths you ever heard  of; tells us of a man's being wounded in the great toe, and expiring  immediately; and how on Priscus, the general, bawling out loud,  seven-and-twenty of the enemy fell down dead upon the spot.  He has  told lies, moreover, about the number of the slain, in contradiction  to the account given in by the leaders.  He will have it that  seventy thousand two hundred and thirty-six of the enemy died at  Europus, and of the Romans only two, and nine wounded.  Surely  nobody in their senses can bear this.    Another thing should be mentioned here also, which is no little  fault.  From the affectation of Atticism, and a more than ordinary  attention to purity of diction, he has taken the liberty to turn the  Roman names into Greek, to call Saturninus, [Greek], Chronius;  Fronto, [Greek], Frontis; Titianus, [Greek], Titanius, and others  still more ridiculous.  With regard to the death of Severian, he  informs us that everybody else was mistaken when they imagined that  he perished by the sword, for that the man starved himself to death,  as he thought that the easiest way of dying; not knowing (which was  the case) that he could only have fasted three days, whereas many  have lived without food for seven; unless we are to suppose that  Osroes stood waiting till Severian had starved himself completely,  and for that reason he would not live out the whole week.    But in what class, my dear Philo, shall we rank those historians who  are perpetually making use of poetical expressions, such as \"the  engine crushed, the wall thundered,\" and in another place, \"Edessa  resounded with the shock of arms, and all was noise and tumult  around;\" and again, \"often the leader in his mind revolved how best  he might approach the wall.\"  At the same time amongst these were  interspersed some of the meanest and most beggarly phrases, such as  \"the leader of the army epistolised his master,\" \"the soldiers  bought utensils,\" \"they washed and waited on them,\" with many other  things of the same kind, like a tragedian with a high cothurnus on  one foot and a slipper on the other.  You will meet with many of  these writers, who will give you a fine heroic long preface, that  makes you hope for something extraordinary to follow, when after  all, the body of the history shall be idle, weak, and trifling, such  as puts you in mind of a sporting Cupid, who covers his head with  the mask of a Hercules or Titan.  The reader immediately cries out,  \"The mountain {39} has brought forth!\"  Certainly it ought not to be  so; everything should be alike and of the same colour; the body  fitted to the head, not a golden helmet, with a ridiculous breast-  plate made of stinking skins, shreds, and patches, a basket shield,  and hog-skin boots; and yet numbers of them put the head of a  Rhodian Colossus on the body of a dwarf, whilst others show you a  body without a head, and step directly into the midst of things,  bringing in Xenophon for their authority, who begins with \"Darius  and Parysatis had two sons;\" so likewise have other ancient writers;  not considering that the narration itself may sometimes supply the  place of preface, or exordium, though it does not appear to the  vulgar eye, as we shall show hereafter.    All this, however, with regard to style and composition, may be  borne with, but when they misinform us about places, and make  mistakes, not of a few leagues, but whole day's journeys, what shall  we say to such historians?  One of them, who never, we may suppose,  so much as conversed with a Syrian, or picked up anything concerning  them in the barbers' {40} shop, when he speaks of Europus, tells us,  \"it is situated in Mesopotamia, two days' journey from Euphrates,  and was built by the Edessenes.\"  Not content with this, the same  noble writer has taken away my poor country, Samosata, and carried  it off, tower, bulwarks, and all, to Mesopotamia, where he says it  is shut up between two rivers, which at least run close to, if they  do not wash the walls of it.  After this, it would be to no purpose,  my dear Philo, for me to assure you that I am not from Parthia, nor  do I belong to Mesopotamia, of which this admirable historian has  thought fit to make me an inhabitant.    What he tells us of Severian, and which he swears he heard from  those who were eye-witnesses of it, is no doubt extremely probable;  that he did not choose to drink poison, or to hang himself, but was  resolved to find out some new and tragical way of dying; that  accordingly, having some large cups of very fine glass, as soon as  he had taken the resolution to finish himself, he broke one of them  in pieces, and with a fragment of it cut his throat; he would not  make use of sword or spear, that his death might be more noble and  heroic.    To complete all, because Thucydides {41} made a funeral oration on  the heroes who fell at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, he  also thought something should be said of Severian.  These"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#4)"],[1,"the  executive head of the greatest of the neutral nations of the world and  as the impartial friend of both parties, his personal influence would  presumably have been very great in preventing a rupture in the  negotiations and in inducing the parties to act in a spirit of  conciliation and compromise.    In October, 1918, however, the United States was a belligerent. Its  national interests were involved; its armies were in conflict with the  Germans on the soil of France; its naval vessels were patrolling the  Atlantic; and the American people, bitterly hostile, were demanding  vengeance on the Governments and peoples of the Central Powers,  particularly those of Germany. President Wilson, it is true, had  endeavored with a measure of success to maintain the position of an  unbiased arbiter in the discussions leading up to the armistice of  November 11, and Germany undoubtedly looked to him as the one hope of  checking the spirit of revenge which animated the Allied Powers in view  of all that they had suffered at the hands of the Germans. It is  probable too that the Allies recognized that Mr. Wilson was entitled to  be satisfied as to the terms of peace since American man power and  American resources had turned the scale against Germany and made victory  a certainty. The President, in fact, dominated the situation. If he  remained in Washington and carried on the negotiations through his  Commissioners, he would in all probability retain his superior place and  be able to dictate such terms of peace as he considered just. But, if he  did as he purposed doing and attended the Peace Conference, he would  lose the unique position which he held and would have to submit to the  combined will of his foreign colleagues becoming a prey to intrigue and  to the impulses arising from their hatred for the vanquished nations.    A practical view of the situation so clearly pointed to the unwisdom of  the President's personal participation in the peace negotiations that a  very probable explanation for his determination to be present at the  Conference is the assumption that the idea had become so firmly embedded  in his mind that nothing could dislodge it or divert him from his  purpose. How far the spectacular feature of a President crossing the  ocean to control in person the making of peace appealed to him I do not  know. It may have been the deciding factor. It may have had no effect at  all. How far the belief that a just peace could only be secured by the  exercise of his personal influence over the delegates I cannot say. How  far he doubted the ability of the men whom he proposed to name as  plenipotentiaries is wholly speculative. Whatever plausible reason may  be given, the true reason will probably never be known.    Not appreciating, at the time that Colonel House informed me of the  President's plan to be present at the Conference, that the matter had  gone as far as it had, and feeling very strongly that it would be a  grave mistake for the President to take part in person in the  negotiations, I felt it to be my duty, as his official adviser in  foreign affairs and as one desirous to have him adopt a wise course, to  state plainly to him my views. It was with hesitation that I did this  because the consequence of the non-attendance of the President would be  to make me the head of the American Peace Commission at Paris. There was  the danger that my motive in opposing the President's attending the  Conference would be misconstrued and that I might be suspected of acting  from self-interest rather than from a sense of loyalty to my chief.  When, however, the armistice went into effect and the time arrived for  completing the personnel of the American Commission, I determined that I  ought not to remain silent.    The day after the cessation of hostilities, that is, on November 12, I  made the following note:       \"I had a conference this noon with the President at the White House     in relation to the Peace Conference. I told him frankly that I     thought the plan for him to attend was unwise and would be a mistake.     I said that I felt embarrassed in speaking to him about it because it     would leave me at the head of the delegation, and I hoped that he     understood that I spoke only out of a sense of duty. I pointed out     that he held at present a dominant position in the world, which I was     afraid he would lose if he went into conference with the foreign     statesmen; that he could practically dictate the terms of peace if he     held aloof; that he would be criticized severely in this country for     leaving at a time when Congress particularly needed his guidance; and     that he would be greatly embarrassed in directing domestic affairs     from overseas.\"    I also recorded as significant that the President listened to my remarks  without comment and turned the conversation into other channels.    For a week after this interview I heard nothing from the President on  the subject, though the fact that no steps were taken to prepare written  instructions for the American Commissioners convinced me that he  intended to follow his original intention. My fears were confirmed. On  the evening of Monday, November 18, the President came to my residence  and told me that he had finally decided to go to the Peace Conference  and that he had given out to the press an announcement to that effect.  In view of the publicity given to his decision it would have been futile  to have attempted to dissuade him from his purpose. He knew my opinion  and that it was contrary to his.    After the President departed I made a note of the interview, in which  among other things I wrote:       \"I am convinced that he is making one of the greatest mistakes of his     career and will imperil his reputation. I may be in error and hope     that I am, but I prophesy trouble in Paris and worse than trouble     here. I believe the President's place is here in America.\"    Whether the decision of Mr. Wilson was wise and whether my prophecy was  unfulfilled, I leave to the judgment of others. His visit to Europe and  its consequences are facts of history. It should be understood that the  incident is not referred to here to justify my views or to prove that  the President was wrong in what he did. The reference is made solely  because it shows that at the very outset there was a decided divergence  of judgment between us in regard to the peace negotiations.    While this difference of opinion apparently in no way affected our  cordial relations, I cannot but feel, in reviewing this period of our  intercourse, that my open opposition to his attending the Conference was  considered by the President to be an unwarranted meddling with his  personal affairs and was none of my business. It was, I believe, the  beginning of his loss of confidence in my judgment and advice, which  became increasingly marked during the Paris negotiations. At the time,  however, I did not realize that my honest opinion affected the President  in the way which I now believe that it did. It had always been my  practice as Secretary of State to speak to him with candor and to  disagree with him whenever I thought he was reaching a wrong decision in  regard to any matter pertaining to foreign affairs. There was a general  belief that Mr. Wilson was not open-minded and that he was quick to  resent any opposition however well founded. I had not found him so  during the years we had been associated. Except in a few instances he  listened with consideration to arguments and apparently endeavored to  value them correctly. If, however, the matter related even remotely to  his personal conduct he seemed unwilling to debate the question. My  conclusion is that he considered his going to the Peace Conference was  his affair solely and that he viewed my objections as a direct criticism  of him personally for thinking of going. He may, too, have felt that my  opposition arose from a selfish desire to become the head of the  American Commission. From that time forward any suggestion or advice  volunteered by me was seemingly viewed with suspicion. It was, however,  long after this incident that I began to feel that the President was  imputing to me improper motives and crediting me with disloyalty to him  personally, an attitude which was as unwarranted as it was unjust.    The President having determined to go to Paris, it seemed almost useless  to urge him not to become a delegate in view of the fact that he had  named but four Commissioners, although it had been arranged that the  Great Powers should each have five delegates in the Conference. This  clearly indicated that the President was at least considering sitting as  the fifth member of the American group. At the same time it seemed that,  if he did not take his place in the Conference as a delegate, he might  retain in a measure his superior place of influence even though he was  in Paris. Four days after the Commission landed at Brest I had a long  conference with Colonel House on matters pertaining to the approaching  negotiations, during which he informed me that there was a determined  effort being made by the European statesmen to induce the President to  sit at the peace table and that he was afraid that the President was  disposed to accede to their wishes. This information indicated that,  while the President had come to Paris prepared to act as a delegate, he  had, after discussing the subject with the Colonel and possibly with  others, become doubtful as to the wisdom of doing so, but that through  the pressure of his foreign colleagues he was turning again to the  favorable view of personal participation which he had held before he  left the United States.    In my conversation with Colonel House I told him my reasons for opposing  the President's taking an active part in the Conference and explained to  him the embarrassment that I felt in advising the President to adopt a  course"]]]
