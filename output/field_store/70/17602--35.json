In this Book it shall be told how he was taken into a magic lake, how he  came out thence to be made knight by King Arthur, and of how he undertook  several of those adventures that made him at once the wonder and the  admiration of all men, and the chiefest glory of the Round Table of  Arthur-Pendragon._    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot greets Queen Guinevere]          Chapter First      _How Sir Launcelot Came Forth From the Enchanted Castle of the Lake and  Entered Into the World Again, and How King Arthur Made Him Knight._    [Sidenote: Of the springtime of long ago] I know not any time of the year  that is more full of joyfulness than the early summer season; for that time  the sun is wonderfully lusty and strong, yet not so very hot; that time the  trees and shrubs are very full of life and very abundant of shade and yet  have not grown dry with the heats and droughts of later days; that time the  grass is young and lush and green, so that when you walk athwart the  meadow-lands it is as though you walked through a fair billowy lake of  magical verdure, sprinkled over with a great multitude of little flowers;  that time the roses are everywhere a-bloom, both the white rose and the  red, and the eglantine is abundant; that time the nests are brimful of  well-fledged nestlings, and the little hearts of the small parent fowls  are so exalted with gladness that they sing with all their mights and  mains, so that the early daytime is filled full of the sweet jargon and the  jubilant medley of their voices. Yea; that is a goodly season of the year,  for though, haply, the spirit may not be so hilarious as in the young and  golden springtime, yet doth the soul take to itself so great a content in  the fulness of the beauty of the world, that the heart is elated with a  great and abundant joy that it is not apt to feel at another season.    [Sidenote: King Arthur and two knights ride a-hunting] Now it chanced upon  the day before Saint John's day in the fulness of a summer-time such as  this, that King Arthur looked forth from his chamber very early in the  morning and beheld how exceedingly fair and very lusty was the world  out-of-doors--all in the freshness of the young daylight. For the sun had  not yet risen, though he was about to rise, and the sky was like to pure  gold for brightness; all the grass and leaves and flowers were drenched  with sweet and fragrant dew, and the birds were singing so vehemently that  the heart of any man could not but rejoice in the fulness of life that lay  all around about him.    There were two knights with King Arthur at that time, one was Sir Ewain,  the son of Morgana le Fay (and he was King Arthur's nephew), and the other  was Sir Ector de Maris, the son of King Ban of Benwick and of Queen  Helen--this latter a very noble, youthful knight, and the youngest of all  the Knights of the Round Table who were at that time elected. These stood  by King Arthur and looked forth out of the window with him and they also  took joy with him in the sweetness of the summer season. Unto them, after a  while, King Arthur spake, saying: \"Messires, meseems this is too fair a day  to stay within doors. For, certes, it is a shame that I who am a king  should be prisoner within mine own castle, whilst any ploughman may be free  of the wold and the green woods and the bright sun and the blue sky and the  wind that blows over hill and dale. Now, I too would fain go forth out of  doors and enjoy these things; wherefore I ordain that we shall go  a-hunting this day and that ye and I shall start before any others of the  lords and the ladies that dwell herein are awake. So let us take our horses  and our hounds and let us take certain foresters and huntsmen, and let us  go forth a-hunting into the green forest; for this day shall be holiday for  me and for you and we shall leave care behind us, and for a while we shall  disport ourselves in pleasant places.\"    So they all did as King Arthur bade; they made them each man ready with his  own hands, and they bade the huntsmen and the foresters to attend thereupon  as the King had ordained. Then they rode forth from the castle and out into  the wide world that lay beyond, and it was yet so early in the morning that  none of the castle folk were astir to know of their departure.    All that day they hunted in the forest with much joy and with great sport,  nor did they turn their faces toward home again until the day was so far  spent that the sun had sunk behind the tops of the tall leafy trees. Then,  at that time, King Arthur gave command that they should bend their ways  toward Camelot once more.    [Sidenote: King Arthur and his companions find a strange damsel and a  dwarf] Now this time, being the Eve of Saint John, fairies and those folk  who are fay come forth, as is very well known, into the world from which  they dwell apart at other times. So when King Arthur and those two knights  and their several foresters and huntsmen came to a certain outlying part of  the forest, they were suddenly aware of a damsel and a dwarf waiting where  the road upon which they were travelling crossed another road, and they  perceived, from her very remarkable appearance, that the damsel was very  likely Fay. For both she and her dwarf sat each upon a milk-white horse,  very strangely still, close to where was a shrine by a hedge of hawthorne;  and the damsel was so wonderfully fair of face that it was a marvel to  behold her. Moreover, she was clad all in white samite from top to toe and  her garments were embroidered with silver; and the trappings and garniture  of her horse were of white samite studded with bright silver bosses,  wherefore, because of this silver, she glistered with a sudden lustre  whensoever she moved a little. When King Arthur and the two knights who  were with him drew nigh this damsel, much marvelling at her appearance, she  hailed him in a voice that was both high and clear, crying: \"Welcome, King  Arthur! Welcome, King Arthur! Welcome, King Arthur!\" saying three words  three times; and \"Welcome, Sir Ewain!\" \"Welcome, Sir Ector de Maris!\"  addressing each of those lords by his name.    \"Damsel,\" quoth King Arthur, \"it is very singular that you should know who  we are and that we should not know you. Now, will you not tell us your name  and whence you come and whither you go? For of a surety I believe you are  Fay.\"    \"Lord,\" said the damsel, \"it matters not who I am, saving that I am of the  court of a wonderful lady who is your very good friend. She hath sent me  here to meet you and to beseech you to come with me whither I shall lead  you, and I shall lead you unto her.\"    \"Damsel,\" said King Arthur, \"I shall be right glad to go with you as you  desire me to do. So, if you will lead me to your lady, I and my knights  will gladly follow you thitherway to pay our court unto her.\"    [Sidenote: King Arthur and his knights follow the damsel] Upon this the  damsel waved her hand, and drawing her bridle-rein she led the way,  accompanied by the dwarf, and King Arthur and the two knights followed her,  and all their party of foresters and huntsmen and hounds and beagles  followed them.    By this time the sun had set and the moon had risen very fair and round and  as yellow as gold, making a great light above the silent tree-tops.  Everything now was embalmed in the twilight, and all the world was  enshrouded in the mystery of the midsummer eve. Yet though the sun had gone  the light was wonderfully bright, wherefore all that the eye could see  stood sharp-cut and very clear to the vision.    So the damsel and the dwarf led the way for somewhat of a distance, though  not for so very far, until they came of a sudden to where was an open  meadow in the forest, hedged all around with the trees of the woodland. And  here the King and his knights were aware of a great bustle of many people,  some working very busily in setting up several pavilions of white samite,  and others preparing a table as for a feast, and others upon this business  and others upon that; and there were various sumpter-mules and pack-horses  and palfreys all about, as though belonging to a party of considerable  estate.    Then King Arthur and those who were with him beheld that, at some distance  away upon the other side of the meadow, there were three people sitting  under a crab-apple tree upon a couch especially prepared for them, and they  were aware that these people were the chief of all that company.    [Sidenote: King Arthur and his companions are brought to speak with strange  folk] The first party of the three was a knight of very haughty and noble  appearance, clad all in armor as white as silver; and his jupon was white  embroidered with silver, and the scabbard of the sword and the sword-belt  were white, and his shield hung in the crab-tree above him and that, too,  was all white as of silver. This knight still wore his helmet, so that his  countenance was not to be seen. The second party of the three was a lady  clad all in white raiment. Her face was covered by her wimple so that her  countenance also was not to be seen very clearly, but her garments were of  wonderful sort, being of white sarcenet embroidered over with silver in the  pattern of lily flowers. Also she wore around her breast and throat a chain  of shining silver studded with bright and sparkling gems of divers sorts.  The third party of the three was a youth of eighteen years, so beautiful of  face that it seemed to King Arthur that he had never beheld so noble a  being. For his countenance was white and shining, and his hair was as soft  as silk and as black as it was possible to be, and curled down upon his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10751"],[0,"Oregon, Washington and Alaska; Sights and Scenes for the Tourist (#4)"],[1,"a gracious possession for years to come.    THE LEGEND OF THE CASCADES.    There is a quaint Indian legend concerning the Cascades to the effect  that away back in the forgotten times there was a natural bridge across  the river--the water flowing under one arch. The Great Spirit had made  this bridge very beautiful for his red children; it was firm, solid  earth, and covered with trees and grass. The two great giants who sat  always glowering at each other from far away (Mount Adams and Mount  Hood) quarreled terribly once on a time, and the sky grew black with  their smoke and the earth trembled with their roaring. And in their  rage and fury they began to throw great stones and huge mountain  boulders at one another. This great battle lasted for days, and when  the smoke and the thunderings had passed away and the sun shone  peacefully again, the people came back once more. But there was no  bridge there. Pieces of rock made small islands above the lost bridge,  but below that the river fretted and shouted and plunged over jagged  and twisted boulders for miles down the stream, throwing the spray high  in air, madly spending its strength in treacherous whirlpools and deep  seductive currents--ever after to be wrathful, complaining, dangerous.  The stoutest warrior could not live in that terrible torrent. So the  beautiful bridge was lost, destroyed in this Titan battle, but far down  in the water could be seen many of the stately trees which the Great  Spirit caused to remain there as a token of the bridge. These he turned  to stone, and they are there even unto this day. The theory of the  scientists, of course, runs counter to the pretty legend. Science  usually does destroy poetry, and they tell us that a part of the  mountain slid into the river, thus accounting for the remnant of a  forest down in the deep water. Moreover, pieces which have been  recovered show the wood to be live timber, and not petrified, as the  poetic fiction has it. The Columbia has not changed in the centuries,  but flows in the same channel here as when in the remote ages the lava,  overflowing, cut out a course and left its pathway clear for all time.  Below the lower Cascades a sea-coral formation is found, grayish in  color and not very pretty, but showing conclusively its sea formation.  Sandstone is also at times uncovered, showing that this was made by sea  deposit before the lava flowed down upon it. This Oregon country is  said to be the largest lava district in the world. The basaltic  formations in the volcanic lands of Sicily and Italy are famous for  their richness, and Oregon holds out the same promise for agriculture.  The lava formation runs from Portland to Spokane Falls, as far north as  Tacoma, and south as far as Snake river--all basaltic formation  overlaid with an incomparably rich soil.    [Illustration: BRIDAL VEIL FALLS, COLUMBIA RIVER, ORE. On the Union  Pacific Ry.]    The trip from Portland by rail to \"The Dalles,\" if the tourist should  chance not to arrive in Portland by the Union Pacific line from the  east, will be found charming. It is eighty-eight miles distant.  Multnomah Falls is reached in thirty-two miles; Bonneville, forty-one  miles, at the foot of the Cascades; five miles farther is the  stupendous government lock now in process of building around the  rapids; Hood river, sixty-six miles, where tourists leave for the  ascent of Mount Hood. It is about forty miles through a picturesque  region to the base of the mountain. Then from Hood river, an ice-cold  stream, twenty-two miles into \"The Dalles,\" where the steamer may be  taken for the return trip. In this eighty-eight miles from Portland to  \"The Dalles\" there are twelve miles of trestles and bridges. The  railway follows the Columbia's brink the entire distance to within a  few miles of the city. The scenery is impressively grand; the bluffs,  if they may be so called, are bold promontories attaining majestic  heights. One timber shute, where the logs come whizzing into the river  with the velocity of a cannon-ball, is 3,328 feet long, and it is  claimed a log makes the trip in twenty seconds.    THE LOWER COLUMBIA.    _Second Tour_.--While the Upper Columbia abounds in scenery of wild and  picturesque beauty, the tourist must by no means neglect a trip down  the lower river from Portland to Astoria and Ilwaco, and return. The  facilities now offered by the Union Pacific in its splendid fleet of  steamers render this a delightful excursion. On a clear day, one may  enjoy at the junction of the Willamette with the Columbia a very  wonderful sight--five mountain peaks are on view: St. Helens, Mt.  Jefferson, Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, and Mt. Rainier. St. Helens, queen of  the Cascade Range, a fair and graceful cone. Exquisite mantling snows  sweep along her shoulders toward the bristling pines. Not far from her  base, the Columbia crashes through the mountains in a magnificent  chasm, and Mt. Hood, the vigorous prince of the range, rises in a keen  pyramid some 12,000 feet. Small villages and landing-places line the  shores, almost too numerous to mention. There are, of the more  important, St. Johns, St. Helens, Columbia City, Kalama, Rainier,  Westport, Cathlamet, Knappa, and Astoria at the mouth, a busy place of  6,000 people. Salmon canneries there are without number. It is about 98  miles by the chart from Portland to Astoria. Across the bay is the  pretty town of Ilwaco. Ft. Canby and Cape Disappointment look across to  Ft. Stevens and Point Adams. From Astoria, one may drive eighteen miles  to Clatsop Beach, famous for its clams, crab, and trout, and Ben  Holliday's hotel. But the fullest enjoyment is obtained by making a  round trip, including a lay-over at Ilwaco all night, and returning to  Portland next day, and sleeping on board the boat. A railway runs from  the town to the outside beach, a mile and a half distant. There is a  drive twenty-five miles long up this long beach to Shoal Water Bay,  which is beautiful beyond description. This district is the great  supply point for oysters, heavy shipments being made as far south as  San Francisco. Sea bathing, both here and at Clatsop Beach, is very  fine.    The boats of the Union Pacific Ry. on the Columbia leave nothing to be  desired. The \"T.J. Potter,\" a magnificent side-wheel steamer, made her  first trip in July, 1888. She is 235 feet long, 35 feet beam, and 10  feet hold, with a capacity of 600 passengers. The saloon and  state-rooms are fitted with every convenience, and handsomely  decorated. The \"Potter\" was built entirely in Portland, and the  citizens naturally take great pride in the superb vessel. In August,  1888, this steamer made the run from her berth at Portland to the  landing stage at Astoria in five hours and thirty-one minutes. Then  there are two night passenger boats from Portland down, the \"R.R.  Thompson\" and the \"S.G. Reed,\" both stern-wheelers of large size,  spacious, roomy boats, well appointed in every particular. The Thompson  is 215 feet long, 38 feet beam, and 1,158 tons measurement. In addition  to these, there are two day mail passenger and freight boats; they  handle the way traffic; the larger boats above mentioned make the run  direct from Portland to Astoria without any landings.    SOME RANDOM NOTES.    A mistaken idea has possessed many tourists that the Puget Sound steamers  start from Portland; they leave Tacoma for all points on the Sound, and  Tacoma is about 150 miles by rail from Portland.    One steamer sails every twelfth day from Portland to Seattle.    One steamer per month leaves Portland for Alaska, but she touches at Port  Townsend before proceeding north.    One steamship leaves Tacoma for Alaska during the season of 1890, about  every fifteen days, from June to September.    The Ocean steamers sail every fourth day from Portland to San Francisco.    There are semi-weekly boats between Portland and Corvallis, and  tri-weekly between Portland and Salem.    On the Sound there are three boats each way, daily (except Sunday),  between Tacoma and Seattle; one boat each way, daily (except Sunday),  between Tacoma and Victoria; one boat each way, daily (except Sunday),  between Seattle and Whatcom, and one boat, daily (except Sunday), between  Whatcom and Seminahmoo.    Only one class of tickets is sold on the River and Sound boats; on the  Ocean steamers there are two classes: cabin and steerage. The steerage  passengers on the Ocean steamers have a dining-room separate from the  first-class passengers--on the lower deck--and are given abundance of  wholesome food, tea and coffee.    On River and Sound boats, a ticket does not include meals and berths, but  it does on the ocean voyage, or the Alaska trip. The usual price for meals  is 50 cents, and they will be found uniformly excellent. Breakfast, lunch,  and a 6 o'clock dinner are served.    The price of berths on these boats runs from 50 cents for a single berth  to $3 per day for the bridal chamber.    No liquors of any kind are kept on sale on any River or Sound steamer,  but a small stock of the best brands will be found on the Ocean steamers.    State-rooms on the River and Sound steamers are provided with one double  lower and one single upper berth.    Passengers can, if they choose, purchase the full accommodation of a  state-room.    The steerage capacity of each of the three Ocean steamers is about 300.    The diagram of the Ocean steamers and the night boats to Astoria can  always be found at the Union Ticket Office of the Union Pacific Railway  in Portland, corner First and Oak Streets.    Tourists receive more than an ordinary amount of attention on these  steamers, more than is possible to pay them on a railway train. The  pursers will be found polite and obliging, always ready to point out  places of interest and render those little attentions which go so far  toward making travel pleasant.    On River and Sound boats, the forward cabin is generally the"]]]
