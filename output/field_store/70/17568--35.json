SMITH      The tadpoles of this species have been described by Bragg (Copeia,  1936: 14-20, figs. 1-13; Amer. Midl. Nat., 18:273-284, figs. 1-5,  1937). The drawings and descriptions of the mouthparts, however, appear  to have been taken from dried, or immature, or transforming  individuals, for they do not agree among themselves nor do they agree  with larvae obtained in the field and now in the Museum of Natural  History of the University of Kansas.    At hand are two series of tadpoles of this species; one series was  collected July 2, 1938, 1.5 miles east of Meade County State Park,  Kansas, and the other lacks data. The second lot contains numerous  sizes of tadpoles from 14 mm. to 31 mm., and several transforming  specimens which clearly possess the pattern so typical of this species.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Mouthparts of a tadpole of _Bufo cognatus_.  Disk widely spread. Approximately x 45.]    Mouthparts in both series (consisting all told of about 200 specimens)  are fairly constant except in the transforming and extremely young  specimens. The accompanying figure shows them as seen with the mouth  disk widely spread. The indentations at the corners of the mouth in the  papillary fringe are more prominent when the mouthparts are less  extended. The outer row of teeth of the lower labium is sometimes a  little shorter or longer than the figure shows, but the average is  about as indicated. The extent of the medial edge of the papillae on  the lower labium varies somewhat; in some, the papillae barely reach  the level of the ends of the outer row of teeth, while in others they  overlap the ends slightly.    Measurements agree with those given by Bragg, except that appearance of  the hind legs occurs at about 15 mm.; the fore legs appear at about 28  mm. A pattern recognizably similar to that of the adult is evident at  about 20 mm.    These tadpoles show such a striking similarity to those referred by  Wright to _Bufo compactilis_ Wiegmann (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 74:4, pl.  5, fig. 6, 1929) that their conspecificity is suggested. If on the  other hand, the specimen figured by Wright is properly identified, then  the two species must in reality be very closely related. A direct  comparison of positively identified tadpoles of each species is much to  be desired.      21-2764"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31147"],[0,"A New Bat (Myotis) From Mexico"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                  UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS  MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY    Volume 14, No. 13, pp. 161-164, 1 fig.

RAYMOND HALL      A single specimen of little brown bat from the northern part of the  state of Veracruz seems to be of an heretofore unrecognized species. It  is named and described below.         =_Myotis elegans_= new species         _Holotype._--Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 88398 Museum of       Natural History, The University of Kansas; 12-1/2 mi. N. Tihuatlan,       300 ft. elevation, Veracruz, Mexico; obtained on September 24,       1961, by Percy L. Clifton, original No. 985.         _Geographic distribution._--Known only from the type locality.         _Diagnosis._--A small-footed species having a short tail and small       skull. Pelage on upper parts near (16' _l_) Prout's Brown       (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color       Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912), and more golden on       underparts; ears pale brownish and flight-membranes only slightly       darker; thumb small (7.5 mm. including wrist); tragus slender but       deeply notched. Longitudinal, dorsal profile of skull relatively       straight but frontal region elevated from rostrum and lambdoidal       region elevated from posterior part of parietal region; posterior       margin of P4 (in occlusal view) notched.         _Comparisons._--Among named kinds of _Myotis_, _M. elegans_ shows       most resemblance to the species _M. californicus_ and _M.       subulatus_. Differences from the latter include shorter tail and       ear, more golden color on underparts, pale (not blackish) lips,       ears and flight membranes, more slender tragus, shorter skull,       posterior border of P4 (in occlusal view) more deeply notched, and       longitudinal dorsal profile of skull higher in frontal and       lambdoidal regions.         Differences from _M. californicus_ include shorter tail, more       golden color on underparts, deeper notch in tragus, shorter skull,       notched instead of smooth posterior border of P4 (in occlusal       view), longitudinal, dorsal profile of skull less abruptly elevated       in frontal region and with (instead of without) prelambdoidal       depression. From _M. c. mexicanus_ that occurs to the north, west,       and south of the type locality of _M. elegans_ the latter further       differs in darker color, paler ears, paler flight membranes, and       lesser size, including skull.         Differences from _M. nigricans_ of the same region include reddish       instead of black pelage, smaller hind foot, smaller skull, rostrum       smaller in relation to remainder of skull, narrower interorbital       region, and absence of a sagittal crest.         _Measurements._--Total length, 79; length of tail, 34; length of       hind foot, 7.5; length of ear from notch, 12; length of tragus,       6.5; weight, 4 grams; length of forearm, 33.0; greatest length of       skull, 12.4; condylobasal length, 11.9; interorbital constriction,       3.2; breadth of braincase, 6.1; occipital depth, 4.5; length of       mandible, 8.9; length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.6; maxillary       breadth at M3, 4.9; length of mandibular tooth-row, 5.0. Degree of       wear on teeth, stage 2 (in terminology of Miller and Allen, Bull.       U. S. Nat. Mus., 144, May 25, 1928).    _Remarks._--The longitudinal dorsal profile of the skull and the deeply  notched posterior border of P4 seem to be distinctive of _elegans_. When  the characters of _elegans_ first were tabulated it was felt that it  probably was only subspecifically different from some previously named  species. But further study of the distinctive characters indicates that  they are outside the range of variation of any near relative of  _elegans_ and it, therefore, is here accorded specific rank.
