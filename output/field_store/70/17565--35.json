She  apologized to the Stranger.    \"Oh, well,\" said the Stranger, and he laughed a little too, even if he  was a philosopher, \"boys will be boys, and those seem two fine strong  little fellows of yours. One of these days they'll be competing in the  Olympian games, I suppose, and how proud you will be if they should bring  home the wreath of victors!\"    \"They are as strong as the young Hercules, both of them,\" Melas answered,  \"but one is a girl, so we can hope to have but one victor in the family  at best.\"    \"Perhaps two would make you over proud,\" said the Stranger, smiling, \"so  it may be just as well that one is a girl, after all.\"    Dion sat up very straight at these words, but Daphne hung her head. \"I do  wish I were a boy too,\" she said, \"they can do so many things a girl is  not allowed to do. They get the best of everything.\"    \"That must be as the Gods will,\" said the Stranger kindly. \"And Spartan  women have always been considered just as brave as men, even if they  aren't quite as big. Anyway, some of us have to be women because we can't  get along without women in the world.\"    Two bright spots glowed in Lydia's cheeks, and she twirled her distaff  faster than ever. \"I should think not, indeed,\" she said. \"Men aren't  much more fit to take care of themselves than children!\"    Melas and the Stranger laughed, and the Stranger turned to Daphne.    \"Don't you remember, my little maid, how glad Epimetheus was to welcome  Pandora, even if she did bring trouble into the world with her?\" he  asked.    \"No,\" said Daphne, \"I don't know about Pandora. Please tell us about  her!\"    Lydia rose and glanced up at the stars. \"It's getting near bed-time,\" she  said to the Twins; and to the Stranger she added, \"You must excuse the  boldness of my children. They are brought up so far out of the world they  scarcely understand the reverence due men like yourself. You must not  permit them to impose upon your kindness.\"    \"I will gladly tell them about Pandora if you are willing,\" said the  Stranger. \"The fine old tales of Hellas should be the birthright of every  child. They will live so long as there are children in the world to hear  them and old fellows like myself to tell them.\"    \"If you will be so gracious then,\" said Lydia, \"but first let us prepare  ourselves to listen.\"    She signed to Chloe, who immediately brought a basin and towel to the  Stranger and Melas. When they had washed their hands, she carried away  the basin and swept the crumbs into the fire, while Lydia filled cups  with wine and water and set them before her husband and his guest. Then  wood was piled upon the fire, and Lydia seated herself beside it once  more with her distaff and wool-basket, while Chloe crept into the shadow  behind her mistress's chair, and the Twins drew nearer to her footstool.  When everything was quiet once more, the Stranger lifted his wine-cup.    \"Since we are in the country,\" he said, \"we will make our libation to  Demeter, the Goddess of the fields. May yours be fruitful, with her  blessing.\" He poured a little wine on the earthen floor as he spoke.  There was a moment of reverent silence. Then while the flames of the  hearth danced upward toward the sky and the stars winked down from above,  the Stranger began his story.          II    THE STRANGER'S STORY      \"Long, long ago, when the earth was young and the Gods mingled more  freely with men than they do to-day, there lived in Hellas a beautiful  youth named Epimetheus. I am not quite sure that he was the very first  man that ever lived, but at any rate he was one of the first, and he was  very lonely. The world was then more beautiful than I can say. The sun  shone every day in the year, flowers bloomed everywhere, and the earth  brought forth abundantly all that he needed for food, but still  Epimetheus was not happy. The Gods saw how lonely he was and they felt  sorry for him.    \"'Let us give him a companion,' said Zeus, the father of all the Gods.  'Even sun-crowned Olympus would be a desolate place to me if I had to  live all alone.' So the Gods all fell to hunting for just the right  companion to send to poor lonely Epimetheus, and soon they found a lovely  maiden whose name was Pandora. 'She's just the right one,' said  Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. 'See how beautiful she is.' 'Yes,'  said Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, 'but she will need more than beauty  or Epimetheus will tire of her. One cannot love an empty head forever,  even if it is a beautiful one. I will give her learning and wisdom.'    \"'I will give her a sweet voice for singing,' said Apollo. In this way  each one of the Gods gave to Pandora some wonderful gift, and when the  time came for her departure from Olympus, where the Gods dwell, these  gifts were packed away in a marriage-chest of curious workmanship,  and were taken with her to the home of Epimetheus.    \"You can imagine how glad Epimetheus was to receive a bride so nobly  endowed, and for a time everything went very happily upon the earth. At  last, one sad day, a dreadful thing happened.    \"Pandora had been told by the Gods that she must not open the box, lest  she lose all the blessings it contained.    \"But she was curious. She wished to see with her own eyes what was in it,  and one day, when Epimetheus was away from home, she lifted the corner of  the lid! Out flew the gifts of the Gods! She tried her best to close the  lid again, but before she could do so, the blessings had flown away in a  bright cloud.    \"Poor Pandora! She sat down beside the box and wept the very first tears  that were ever shed in this world. While she was weeping and blaming  herself for her disobedience and the trouble it had caused, she heard a  little voice, way down in the bottom of the box.    \"'Don't cry, dear Pandora!' the little voice said. 'You can never be  quite unhappy when I am here, and I am always going to stay with you; I  am Hope.' So Pandora dried her tears, and no matter how full of sorrow  the world has been since, there has never been a time when Hope was gone.  If that time should ever come, the world would be a desolate place  indeed.\"    When he had finished the story, no one said anything at all for a minute,  and then Daphne looked up at the Stranger.    \"Is that really the way all the troubles began?\" she asked. \"Because if  it isn't, I think it's mean to blame everything on poor Pandora.\"    \"Why, Daphne!\" said her Mother in a shocked voice; but the Stranger only  smiled.    \"I should not be surprised if Epimetheus were to blame for a few things  himself,\" he said, stroking his beard. \"Anyway, I'm sure he felt he would  rather have Pandora and all the troubles in the world than to live  without her, and men have felt the same way ever since.\"    \"Well, then,\" began Daphne, her eyes shining like two blue sparks, \"why  don't--?\"    \"Daphne! Daphne!\" cried Lydia warningly. \"You are talking too much for a  little girl.\"    The Stranger nodded kindly to Lydia. \"Let her speak,\" he said. Daphne  spoke.    \"Didn't Athena say Epimetheus would get tired of Pandora if she had an  empty head?\"    \"Yes,\" admitted the Stranger, \"the story certainly runs that way.\"    \"And have men felt like that ever since too?\" Daphne asked.    \"Yes, I think so,\" answered the Stranger. \"Certainly women need wisdom  now as much as Pandora did.\"    \"Then why don't they let us learn things the same as boys,\" gasped  Daphne, a little frightened at her own boldness. \"Dion's always telling  me I can't do things or go to places because I am a girl. I want to know  things if I _am_ a girl. I can't try for the Olympian games and I can't  even go to see them just because I am a girl.\" She stopped quite  overcome.    Melas and Lydia and Dion were all too astonished to speak. Only the  Stranger did not seem shocked. He drew Daphne up beside him.    \"My dear,\" he said, \"a child can ask questions which even a philosopher  cannot answer. I do not know myself why the world feels as it does, but  it certainly has always seemed to be afraid to let women know too much.  It has always seemed to prefer they should have beauty rather than  brains.\"    \"Yes, but,\" urged Daphne, \"I don't see why I can't try for the games too,  when I am big enough. I can run just as fast as Dion and do everything he  can do.\"    Melas smiled. \"Daphne is true to her Spartan blood,\" he said. \"The girls  used to compete in the games at Sparta.\"    The Philosopher stroked Daphne's hair. \"So your name is Daphne,\" he said,  smiling, \"And you can run fast and you have golden hair! Did you know it  was to the fleet-footed nymph Daphne with golden hair that we owe the  victor's crown at the Olympian games, even though no woman may wear it?\"    Daphne shook her head. \"I don't know what you mean,\" she said.    \"I mean this,\" said the Stranger. \"It is said that once upon a time  Apollo himself loved a beautiful nymph named Daphne. But Daphne did not  love Apollo even though he was a God, and when he pursued her she ran  away. She was as swift as the wind, but Apollo was still more swift, and  when she saw that she could not escape him by flight, she prayed to her  father, who was a river god, and, to protect her, he changed her form by  magic. Her arms became branches, her golden hair became leaves, and her  feet took root in the ground. When Apollo reached her side, she was no  longer a beautiful maiden, but a lovely laurel tree. Apollo gathered some  of the shining leaves and wove them into a wreath. 'If you will not be my  bride,' he cried, 'you shall at least be my tree and your leaves shall be  my crown,' and that is why at the games over which Apollo presides, the  victor is still crowned with laurel. It was Apollo himself who gave us  the custom and made it sacred. So, my little maid,\" he finished, \"you  give us our crowns even though you may not win them for yourselves, don't  you see? Isn't that almost as good?\"    \"Maybe it is,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9976"],[0,"Hernani (#3)"],[1,"Bonaparte; but when the boys  were old enough to attend school their mother took them to Paris,  while the father fought through a guerilla war against the brigands  headed by Fra Diavolo. After several years of tranquillity in France,  Madame Hugo and her sons were again called to follow the fortunes  of the head of the family, this time in Spain. The father won a  generalship in the French army in that conquered country, and became  majordomo of the palace at Madrid. The boys attended school in a  college for noblemen's sons, and were badly treated by the young  Spaniards, who could not forget that the French lads were the children  of one of their conquerors. But after a brief sojourn in Spain they  returned to Paris, and there the poet-life of Victor Hugo began, and  began in earnest; for during three years, at school and at home, he  composed verses of all sorts, and in 1817, in competition for a prize  offered by the National Academy, he wrote an ode which, although not  successful in the contest, brought him into public notice.    The next year he won a prize in the Floral Games of Toulouse, with a  poem which is published among his other works, and which is one of the  most remarkable productions of precocious genius known to literary  history. In 1821 he had his first taste of the bitterness of life,  and his boyhood came to an abrupt termination, in the death of his  excellent mother. On the same day he became engaged to a young girl  who had for a long time been his schoolmate and almost a member of  his own home-circle. Her parents allowed his suit, but postponed the  marriage until he should have proved himself capable of supporting a  family. He set to work with feverish ardor and undertook almost every  kind of literary production--odes, plays, novels. The first of his  successes under this new stimulus were two remarkable stories, «Bug  Jargal» and «Han d'Islande», stories which indicate a strange and  exuberant imagination, tropical in its fervor, its singularity, its  fecundity.    But it was in 1826, by the publication of his «Odes et Ballades», that  he laid the real corner-stone of his fame. The king, Louis XVIII,  liked the poems, for a natural reason, as we shall see, and gave their  author a pension of one thousand francs, which in those days, and  in economical France, seemed a large sum, and the young people were  permitted to marry. It will be interesting to observe what was the  character of the «Odes et Ballades». They are almost all political  and religious, and all thoroughly conservative; all in praise of the  Bourbons, condemnatory of the Revolution; silent as to Napoleon, or  nearly so, and glowing with devotion to the Roman Catholic Church.  They remind us of what Wordsworth twenty-five years earlier wrote,  in a precisely contrary spirit, when he was influenced by the hopes  inspired by the first events of 1789, and before the subsequent  outrages changed him into a stiff British church-and-state  conservative. These early effusions of Hugo are noble pieces of  versification, and wonderful enough as the works of a very young man;  but they cannot be called poetry of a high order, nor do they even  give promise of what he was to do later, except that towards the last  we begin to find poems which bid us expect great things in the way of  style.    Two years afterward, in 1828, appeared a second volume of poems,  «Les Orientales», a collection of dream-pictures of Eastern life, in  somewhat the same manner as the efforts of Thomas Moore which were  popular with young ladies of the last generation, but infinitely  superior to all the «Lalla Rookhs» and other impossibilities of that  little Irish dandy. The fact is that some of Hugo's most beautiful  lyrics are to be found in this collection, and certainly some of his  greatest successes in passionate, highly-colored description. He was a  man whose heart grew slowly, however, and we look in vain as yet  for poems which could teach us much about life and how to bear it  patiently or enjoy it nobly.    But we are now in the midst of the four years during which Victor Hugo  was changing his attitude towards art entirely, 1826-1830. Up to this  time he had not entered specially into the business of criticism,  had not made theories about writing, but simply written, either  celebrating his political heroes or letting his fancy wander through  distant lands, which were full of glamour because distant. He had  gathered about him a circle of interesting people; indeed he was  already the young king of nearly all the rising literary men and  women in Paris. It was natural that there should be a great deal of  discussion among them about the rules and proprieties of their art;  but Victor Hugo was still, in this matter as in every other, a  conservative.    In 1827 he surprised this little world of admirers with a drama,  «Cromwell», in the preface to which he expounded some advanced views  in regard to dramatic writing. His opinions were debated, and all  Paris was divided into their supporters and opponents. In 1830  appeared «Hernani», which he succeeded in having played at the Théâtre  français, in spite of the opposition of the Academy, which saw in it a  menace to good literature.    There are few exciting events in the history of literature. It is in  the main a record of quiet, intellectual lives, a story of thoughts  and tendencies. The account of a single border feud will present a  greater number of striking incidents than the history of the forces  which have produced our English poetry or Germany's philosophy.  And the few memorable anecdotes of a concrete character which are  scattered here and there in the chronicles of literature usually  attract more attention than they deserve. They are suitable chiefly  to awaken the interest of children and ignorant people. Out of ten  persons who will tell you that Demosthenes practised oratory by the  sea-shore, with a pebble in his mouth, not more than one has any  notion what his orations themselves were about. The man who is most  set agog by the story of Shakespeare's poaching exploit is the least  likely to have read his plays. The same thing might be said of the  hubbub occasioned by the first representation of Victor Hugo's  «Hernani», on February 25, 1830. There is a temptation to make  «Hernani» the text of disquisitions on Romanticism, forgetting that it  is a drama of high intrinsic merit, and that the question of positive  value is, after all, the essential one.    Word was passed about among those who regarded Hugo's new theories  with aversion, and a large and mainly hostile audience was assembled  on that memorable night, the most eventful _premiere_ since the first  representation of Corneille's «Cid», nearly two hundred years before.  Everybody knows what happened. Everybody knows how fashion and  aristocracy and journalism combined to kill the new piece, which was  said to have been written in defiance of the rules followed by Racine  and Voltaire; how the regular theatre-goers hissed, and were howled  at in turn by the worshippers of novelty, frowsy, long-haired young  artists and penny-a-liners and students, from the left bank of the  Seine, who had been brought over to support the play. One of the most  sacred institutions of the French theatre is the _claque_, or body of  hired applauders. Now on this occasion there was no _claque_, for  the friends of Victor Hugo had distributed free tickets in the Latin  Quarter, and their recipients were present, ready to raise the roof if  necessary. The hissing and hooting began almost with the first line,  and continued for several hours, until the actors had mouthed through  the whole tragedy; and yet it was considered that «Hernani» had won  the day.    To us such a way of supporting the fine arts and defending the canons  of literary taste, indeed even such widespread and frenzied interest  in anything except business, sport, politics, and religion, seems, to  say the least, remarkable. But we must remember that the French go to  the theatre even more than we go to church; that in February 1830 it  was not safe to get excited about politics in Paris; that athletics  were neglected in France previous to 1871; and that possibly the  French might disagree with us in our estimation of business as the  chief end of man. But although I admire the French for this fine  capability of theirs,--this capability of taking an excited interest  in the things of the mind, I cannot help thinking that the critics and  historians have made too much of that fracas on the 25th of February,  1830, in the Théâtre francais. They tell us that this was the first  great fight between the Romanticists and the Classicists.    We can learn what these words mean only by getting the critics to  indicate to us a piece of art-work constructed according to the  Romanticists and another constructed according to the Classicists, and  then comparing them and picking out the essential differences.  They say «Hernani» is a drama of the Romanticists, and that  seventeenth-century tragedy was classical. We find, indeed, that  Victor Hugo's drama differs from Racine's; «Hernani» is based upon  life in Spain, and not in Greece or Rome, and the period is the  sixteenth century, and not the age of Pericles or Tiberius Caesar.  But if this is all, then Corneille was a Romanticist, for his first  successful tragedy, the «Cid», is also a drama of Spanish life, and  is set, moreover, in the Middle Ages. But, they say, this is not all:  «Hernani» is romantic because it contains a mingling of the comic and  the heroic, inasmuch as there are in it words and notions of common  use, where the author might have employed expressions and ideas  consecrated and set apart wholly to the service of poetry.    And this is true. Victor Hugo does use both phrases and thoughts that  no writer of French tragedy had dared to use before. And here, rather  than anywhere else,"]]]
