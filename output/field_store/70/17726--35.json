This is the second Egyptian chapter.  It has its direct relation to the Hieroglyphic chapter, page 171. I note  that I say here it costs a dime to go to the show. Well, now it costs  around thirty cents to go to a good show in a respectable suburb,  sometimes fifty cents. But we will let that dime remain there, as a  matter of historic interest, and pass on, to higher themes.    Certainly the Hieroglyphic chapter is in words of one syllable and any  kindergarten teacher can understand it. Chapter nineteen adds a bit to  the idea. I do not know how warranted I am in displaying Egyptian  learning. Newspaper reporters never tire of getting me to talk about  hieroglyphics in their relation to the photoplays, and always give me  respectful headlines on the theme. I can only say that up to this hour,  every time I have toured art museums, I have begun with the Egyptian  exhibit, and if my patient guest was willing, lectured on every period on  to the present time, giving a little time to the principal exhibits in  each room, but I have always found myself returning to Egypt as a  standard. It seems my natural classic land of art. So when I took up  hieroglyphics more seriously last summer, I found them extraordinarily  easy as though I were looking at a \"movie\" in a book. I think Egyptian  picture-writing came easy because I have analyzed so many hundreds of  photoplay films, merely for recreation, and the same style of composition  is in both. Any child who reads one can read the other. But of course  the literal translation must be there at hand to correct all wrong  guesses. I figure that in just one thousand years I can read  hieroglyphics without a pony. But meanwhile, I tour museums and I ride  Pharaoh's \"horse,\" and suggest to all photoplay enthusiasts they do the  same. I recommend these two books most heartily: Elementary Egyptian  Grammar, by Margaret A. Murray, London, Bernard Quaritch, 11 Grafton  Street, Bond Street, W., and the three volumes of the Book of the Dead,  which are, indeed, the Papyrus of Ani, referred to in this chapter, pages  255-258. It is edited, translated, and reproduced in fac-simile by the  keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum,  Professor E.A. Wallis Budge; published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York,  and Philip Lee Warner, London. This book is certainly the greatest motion  picture I ever attended. I have gone through it several times, and it is  the only book one can read twelve hours at a stretch, on the Pullman,  when he is making thirty-six hour and forty-eight hour jumps from town to  town.    American civilization grows more hieroglyphic every day. The cartoons of  Darling, the advertisements in the back of the magazines and on the  bill-boards and in the street-cars, the acres of photographs in the  Sunday newspapers, make us into a hieroglyphic civilization far nearer to  Egypt than to England. Let us then accept for our classic land, for our  standard of form, the country naturally our own. Hieroglyphics are so  much nearer to the American mood than the rest of the Egyptian legacy,  that Americans seldom get as far as the Hieroglyphics to discover how  congenial they are. Seeing the mummies, good Americans flee. But there is  not a man in America writing advertisements or making cartoons or films  but would find delightful the standard books of Hieroglyphics sent out by  the British Museum, once he gave them a chance. They represent that very  aspect of visual life which Europe understands so little in America, and  which has been expanding so enormously even the last year. Hallowe'en,  for instance, lasts a whole week now, with mummers on the streets every  night, October 25-31.    Chapter XX--The Prophet-Wizard. Who do we mean by The Prophet-Wizard? We  mean not only artists, such as are named in this chapter, but dreamers  and workers like Johnny Appleseed, or Abraham Lincoln. The best account  of Johnny Appleseed is in Harper's Monthly for November, 1871. People do  not know Abraham Lincoln till they have visited the grave of Anne  Rutledge, at Petersburg, Illinois, then New Old Salem a mile away. New  Old Salem is a prophet's hill, on the edge of the Sangamon, with lovely  woods all around. Here a brooding soul could be born, and here the  dreamer Abraham Lincoln spent his real youth. I do not call him a dreamer  in a cheap and sentimental effort to describe a man of aspiration.  Lincoln told and interpreted his visions like Joseph and Daniel in the  Old Testament, revealing them to the members of his cabinet, in great  trials of the Civil War. People who do not see visions and dream dreams  in the good Old Testament sense have no right to leadership in America. I  would prefer photoplays filled with such visions and oracles to the state  papers written by \"practical men.\" As it is, we are ruled indirectly by  photoplays owned and controlled by men who should be in the shoe-string  and hook-and-eye trade. Apparently their digestions are good, they are in  excellent health, and they keep out of jail.    Chapter XXI--The Acceptable Year of the Lord. If I may be pardoned for  referring again to the same book, I assumed, in The Golden Book of  Springfield, Illinois, that the Acceptable Year of the Lord would come  for my city beginning November 1, 2018, and that up to that time, amid  much of joy, there would also be much of thwarting and tribulation. But  in the beginning of that mystic November, the Soul of My City, named  Avanel, would become as much a part of the city as Pallas Athena was  Athens, and indeed I wrote into the book much of the spirit of the  photoplay outlined, pages 147 through 150. But in The Golden Book I  changed the lady the city worshipped from a golden image into a living,  breathing young girl, descendant of that great American, Daniel Boone,  and her name, obviously, Avanel Boone. With her tribe she incarnates all  the mystic ideals of the Boones of Kentucky.    All this but a prelude to saying that I have just passed through the city  of Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is a Santa Fe full of the glory of the New  Architecture of which I have spoken, and the issuing of a book of cowboy  songs collected, and many of them written, by N. Howard Thorp, a citizen  of Santa Fe, and thrilling with the issuing of a book of poems about the  Glory of New Mexico. This book is called Red Earth. It is by Alice Corbin  Henderson. And Santa Fe is full of the glory of a magnificent State  Capitol that is an art gallery of the whole southwest, and the glories of  the studio of William Penhallow Henderson, who has painted our New Arabia  more splendidly than it was ever painted before, with the real character  thereof, and no theatricals. This is just the kind of a town I hoped for  when I wrote my first draft of The Art of the Moving Picture. Here now is  literature and art. When they become one art as of old in Egypt, we will  have New Mexico Hieroglyphics from the Hendersons and their kind, and  their surrounding Indian pupils, a basis for the American Motion Picture  more acceptable, and more patriotic, and more organic for us than the  Egyptian.    And I come the same month to Denver, and find a New Art Museum projected,  which I hope has much indeed to do with the Acceptable Year of the Lord,  when films as vital as the Santa Fe songs and pictures and architecture  can be made, and in common spirit with them, in this New Arabia. George  W. Eggers, the director of the newly projected Denver Art Museum, assures  me that a photoplay policy can be formulated, amid the problems of such  an all around undertaking as building a great Art Museum in Denver. He  expects to give the photoplay the attention a new art deserves,  especially when it affects almost every person in the whole country. So I  prophesy Denver to be the Museum and Art-school capital of New Arabia, as  Santa Fe is the artistic, architectural, and song capital at this hour.  And I hope it may become the motion picture capital of America from the  standpoint of pure art, not manufacture.    What do I mean by New Arabia?    When I was in London in the fall of 1920 the editor of The Landmark, the  organ of The English Speaking Union, asked me to draw my map of the  United States. I marked out the various regions under various names. For  instance I called the coast states, Washington, Oregon, and California,  New Italy. The reasons may be found in the chapter in this book on  California. Then I named the states just west of the Middle West, and  east of New Italy, New Arabia. These states are New Mexico, Arizona,  Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. These are the states which  carry the Rocky Mountains north toward the Aurora Borealis, and south  toward the tropics. Here individualism, Andrew Jacksonism, will forever  prevail, and American standardization can never prevail. In cabins that  cannot be reached by automobile and deserts that cannot be crossed by  boulevards, the John the Baptists, the hermits and the prophets can  strengthen their souls. Here are lonely places as sweet for the spirit as  was little old New Salem, Illinois, one hundred years ago, or the  wilderness in which walked Johnny Appleseed.    Now it is the independence of Spirit of this New Arabia that I hope the  Denver Art Museum can interpret in its photoplay films, and send them on  circuits to the Art Museums springing up all over America, where  sculpture, architecture, and painting are now constantly sent on circuit.  Let that already established convention--the \"circuit-exhibition\"--be  applied to this new art.    And after Denver has shown the way, I devoutly hope that Great City of  Los Angeles may follow her example. Consider, O Great City of Los  Angeles, now almost the equal of New York in power and splendor,  consider"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13030"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 09 (#4)"],[1,", puts upon all  within its power. The law is negative and repressive, self-interest is  positive and assertive; between the two there is no possible  reconciliation--at most a compromise--so that in the last analysis it  appears that the assertion of individual will as such is immoral, that  is, contrary to the will of the community; and is sinful, for it is not  the will of God, but the will of a particularized individual, however  godly he may be. There are differences in degree, but not in kind, among  immoralities and sins, with corresponding degrees of punitive  repression; but the potential tragic conflict is constant, and there is  as little doubt about the eminent domain of the State as about the  supremacy of God.    The laws of God are changeless and eternal, but human morality is a  local and temporal development. As the character of an individual is the  product of disposition and experience, so his fate is humanly determined  by the particular forms of custom and law established in the community  in which his lot is cast. But these change from time to time, and in  periods of change the disparity between public and private interest is  most conspicuous: the progressive individual bears not only the burden  of proof but also the dead weight of public inertia. Only at infinity  can the parallel antithetical interests coincide. Nevertheless, the  world gradually effects self-correction by the evolution of new  syntheses from the thesis and antithesis ever and anon presented for  trial and judgment as between liberal and conservative forces.    Hebbel's drama, then, is the representation of a process, the process of  life, by which things come into being. It reveals the individual in the  making, and discusses the validity of the institutions that condition  his life or cause his death. There is no question of guilt and  atonement. Protagonist and antagonist are right, each in his way and  from his point of view; the conflict may arise from excess of goodness  as well as from excess of evil; but the representative of the whole  prevails of necessity over the champion of a single interest; and in the  knowledge of this truth, rather than in the futile attempt to modify the  relation, we must seek our freedom. Hebbel's plays are historical:  character in its setting of circumstances is the only character really  and fully comprehensible. They are sociological: exhibiting the  ceaseless collision of individualistic and collectivistic tendencies,  they teach forbearance, and patience, and the will to face the  facts--_tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner_. And they are modern:  treating problems of character and _milieu_, they disdain the  adventitious aids of eloquence and theatrical splendor, and speak to us  with the directness, often with the bluntness, of nature herself. Hebbel  was no naturalist, in the sense of one who seeks but to reproduce  phenomena in all their details, sordid, trivial, or vulgar, if such they  be. But through Ibsen, who esteemed him alone among his German  predecessors, he became a factor in the recent naturalistic movement;  and he might have saved it from many an aberration, if his example had  been more closely followed.    Hebbel strikingly revealed his independence and originality at the  beginning of his public career, by his new conception of old and  familiar subjects. His Judith is a totally different person from the  heroine of the Apocrypha. The Biblical Judith is a widow who slays a  public enemy, and returns unscathed amid the plaudits of the multitude.  But Hebbel's Judith is a widow who has never been a wife, a woman who  seems to have been appointed by Providence to do a great deed in His  service, who takes the duty upon herself only to find that as a woman  she is unequal to it; for as a woman she loves the manly heathen. She  kills him, as she set out to do; but the motive for her act is personal  revenge for a personal outrage; and she returns to Bethulia broken in  spirit and appalled at the thought that she may bear a son by  Holofernes. The attempt to make of herself an impersonal instrument in  the hands of the Almighty--certainly a laudable undertaking--is her only  fault, and is tragic because inconsistent with the character of  womanhood, which the Almighty has also ordained. Compared with the iron  necessity of her being, to which Judith succumbs, the accidental and  improbable fault of Schiller's Maid of Orleans seems as trivial as it is  conventional.    Similarly, in the conception of the story of Genoveva, Hebbel shifted  attention from the saint to the sinner. In the centre of his _Genoveva_  stands Golo, the unfortunate young man whose good instincts are made  criminal because the faults and errors of others excite them, and  because his desire, justifiable according to nature, is directed toward  a woman who is bound to another in a wedlock which, from the side of the  husband at least, is only formally correct. In Golo's crime and  atonement we accordingly see a great deal more than the operation of the  moral law: we see how crime is begotten of innocence; and instead of  thinking of the wretched creature, we think of the Creator who has so  ordained it, and at whose central position in the moral universe there  can be neither good nor evil, but an equilibrium of forces which become  one or the other, and may become either when the equilibrium is  disturbed. Good and evil, mutually exclusive qualities in the world of  appearance, are, in the world of ideas, complementary conceptions,  different aspects of one and the same thing.    Golo appears, despite his crimes, less guilty than Siegfried, the  husband of Genoveva; and in his case a divine impulse, love, becomes an  evil because it happens to collide with an institution, marriage, which  we are here justified in calling human, since, though it has a social  sanction, it lacks the evidence of divine approval. Clara, in _Maria  Magdalena_, is chargeable with but the minimum of guilt, and perishes  because, too honest and dutiful to safeguard her own interests in a  stern and selfish community, she cannot otherwise preserve for her  father that unassailable reputation which is, in his imperfect ethics,  the highest good. The tragedy in this play is the tragedy of pharisaical  _bourgeois_ society itself. There is no collision between high and low,  such as constituted the plot of the _tragedies bourgeoises_ of the  eighteenth century--e.g., Lessing's _Emilia Galotti_, Schiller's _Cabal  and Love_--but the stubborn hardness of the middle-class society in its  typical representative is unable to meet a crisis; and by the  banishment, or the condemnation to suicide, of its most promising  members, this society pronounces its own doom. Altruism is contrary to  the custom, that is, to the morals of this community, and for that  reason is forbidden and suppressed.    Another community in which altruism is unusual and discredited is Judaea  just before the birth of Christ. Herod the king is a masterful ruler and  a benefactor; but the end justifies the means that he adopts, and he is  no respecter of persons. He does not even respect the person of his  wife. The love of Mariamne is the one sure rock upon which he can rest  when the earthquake, threatening at every moment, comes to shatter his  throne and engulf him. He loves her too with a passion which dreams of  union so perfect that death cannot break it, so perfect that one of them  would wish to die at the moment when the soul of the other left the  body. This is Mariamne's dream also, but Herod cannot trust her to  fulfil it. Not once, but twice, upon going to the wars, he leaves orders  that Mariamne shall be slain if he is killed; and these orders are an  assassination of her soul. The community can execute an individual; but  one individual can only assassinate another. In the ancient orient a  wife was a precious possession, entirely subject to the will of her  husband, and liable to be burned in his funeral pyre. Herod represents  such an ancient, oriental point of view; but Judaea is on the eve of  becoming occidental and modern. Herod represents the law and has the  power to crush the insurgent personality of Mariamne: he has not the  power to slay the infant Savior, nor to hinder the coming of the day  when every human soul is known to be an object of divine concern.    That play of Hebbel's in which the dualism of all being is most  conspicuously tragic is _Agnes Bernauer_. Agnes is the daughter of a  barber and surgeon, and is so beautiful that she is commonly known as  the angel of Augsburg. Albrecht, the son and sole heir of the reigning  duke Ernst, comes to Augsburg, falls in love with her, and, in spite of  friendly warning, marries her; for she has loved him at first sight,  too. As persons, they do what is right for them to do; their marriage  has been performed by a priest of the church; and they feel that it has  divine sanction. But Albrecht is not an ordinary person; he is the heir  to the throne, and public exigencies require that the succession shall  be guaranteed. This marriage, however, is illegal--a board of  incorruptible judges so finds it; it causes sedition and threatens  interminable strife. Duke Ernst is deliberate and patient in dealing  with the unprecedented case. He waits until he can wait no longer.  Albrecht will not give up Agnes, nor Agnes give up him; Ernst respects  the sacrament of wedlock by which they are united, and only after two  and a half years does he sign the warrant by which Agnes was duly  condemned to death. Agnes dies in perfect innocence and constancy, a  victim of social convention. But Albrecht, whose disregard of this  convention was rebellion, and whose vengeance for his wife's death  brings him to the point of parricide, is made to see, not merely because  excommunication accompanies the ban of the empire on him as a rebel, but  also because of the instructive words and"]]]
