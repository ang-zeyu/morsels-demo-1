Then he would tell us all about his walk, where he put up a  covey of black game, what new paths he discovered in the imperial  wood beyond Kudeyarof Well, or, if he rode, how the young horse he was  breaking in began to understand the reins and the pressure of the leg.  All this he would relate in the most vivid and entertaining way, so that  the time passed gaily and animatedly.    After dinner he would go back to his room to read, and at eight we  had tea, and the best hours of the day began--the evening hours, when  everybody gathered in the zala. The grown-ups talked or read aloud or  played the piano, and we either listened to them or had some jolly game  of our own, and in anxious fear awaited the moment when the English  grandfather-clock on the landing would give a click and a buzz, and  slowly and clearly ring out ten.    Perhaps mama would not notice? She was in the sitting-room, making a  copy.    \"Come, children, bedtime! Say good night,\" she would call.    \"In a minute, Mama; just five minutes.\"    \"Run along; it's high time; or there will be no getting you up in the  morning to do your lessons.\"    We would say a lingering good night, on the lookout for any chance for  delay, and at last would go down-stairs through the arches, annoyed at  the thought that we were children still and had to go to bed while the  grown-ups could stay up as long as ever they liked.          A JOURNEY TO THE STEPPES    WHEN I was still a child and had not yet read \"War and Peace,\" I was  told that NATASHA ROSTOF was Aunt Tanya. When my father was asked  whether that was true, and whether DMITRY ROSTOF was such and such a  person and LEVIN such and such another, he never gave a definite answer,  and one could not but feel that he disliked such questions and was  rather offended by them.    In those remote days about which I am talking, my father was very keen  about the management of his estate, and devoted a lot of energy to it. I  can remember his planting the huge apple orchard at Yasnaya and several  hundred acres of birch and pine forest, and at the beginning of the  seventies, for a number of years, he was interested in buying up land  cheap in the province of Samara, and breeding droves of steppe horses  and flocks of sheep.    I still have pretty clear, though rather fragmentary and inconsequent,  recollections of our three summer excursions to the steppes of Samara.    My father had already been there before his marriage in 1862, and  afterward by the advice of Dr. Zakharyin, who attended him. He took the  kumiss-cure in 1871 and 1872, and at last, in 1873, the whole family  went there.    At that time my father had bought several hundred acres of cheap  Bashkir lands in the district of Buzuluk, and we went to stay on our new  property at a khutor, or farm.    In Samara we lived on the farm in a tumble-down wooden house, and beside  us, in the steppe, were erected two felt kibitkas, or Tatar frame tents,  in which our Bashkir, Muhammed Shah Romanytch, lived with his wives.    Morning and evening they used to tie the mares up outside the kibitkas,  where they were milked by veiled women, who then hid themselves from the  sight of the men behind a brilliant chintz curtain, and made the kumiss.    The kumiss was bitter and very nasty, but my father and my uncle Stephen  Behrs were very fond of it, and drank it in large quantities.    When we boys began to get big, we had at first a German tutor for two or  three years, Fyodor Fyodorovitch Kaufmann.    I cannot say that we were particularly fond of him. He was rather rough,  and even we children were struck by his German stupidity. His redeeming  feature was that he was a devoted sportsman. Every morning he used to  jerk the blankets off us and shout, \"Auf, Kinder! auf!\" and during the  daytime plagued us with German calligraphy.          OUTDOOR SPORTS    THE chief passion of my childhood was riding. I well remember the time  when my father used to put me in the saddle in front of him and we  would ride out to bathe in the Voronka. I have several interesting  recollections connected with these rides.    One day as we were going to bathe, papa turned round and said to me:    \"Do you know, Ilyusha, I am very pleased with myself to-day. I have been  bothered with her for three whole days, and could not manage to make  her go into the house; try as I would, it was impossible. It never would  come right. But to-day I remembered that there is a mirror in every  hall, and that every lady wears a bonnet.    \"As soon as I remembered that, she went where I wanted her to, and did  everything she had to. You would think a bonnet is a small affair, but  everything depended on that bonnet.\"    As I recall this conversation, I feel sure that my father was talking  about that scene in \"Anna Karenina\" where ANNA went to see her son.    Although in the final form of the novel nothing is said in this scene  either about a bonnet or a mirror,--nothing is mentioned but a thick  black veil,--still, I imagine that in its original form, when he was  working on the passage, my father may have brought Anna up to the  mirror, and made her straighten her bonnet or take it off.    I can remember the interest with which he told me this, and it now  seems strange that he should have talked about such subtle artistic  experiences to a boy of seven who was hardly capable of understanding  him at the time. However, that was often the case with him.    I once heard from him a very interesting description of what a writer  needs for his work:    \"You cannot imagine how important one's mood is,\" he said. \"Sometimes  you get up in the morning, fresh and vigorous, with your head clear, and  you begin to write. Everything is sensible and consistent. You read it  over next day, and have to throw the whole thing away, because, good  as it is, it misses the main thing. There is no imagination in it,  no subtlety, none of the necessary something, none of that only just  without which all your cleverness is worth nothing. Another day you  get up after a bad night, with your nerves all on edge, and you think,  'To-day I shall write well, at any rate.' And as a matter of fact, what  you write is beautiful, picturesque, with any amount of imagination. You  look it through again; it is no good, because it is written stupidly.  There is plenty of color, but not enough intelligence.    \"One's writing is good only when the intelligence and the imagination  are in equilibrium. As soon as one of them overbalances the other, it's  all up; you may as well throw it away and begin afresh.\"    As a matter of fact, there was no end to the rewriting in my father's  works. His industry in this particular was truly marvelous.    We were always devoted to sport from our earliest childhood. I can  remember as well as I remember myself my father's favorite dog in those  days, an Irish setter called Dora. They would bring round the cart, with  a very quiet horse between the shafts, and we would drive out to the  marsh, to Degatna or to Malakhov. My father and sometimes my mother or a  coachman sat on the seat, while I and Dora lay on the floor.    When we got to the marsh, my father used to get out, stand his gun on  the ground, and, holding it with his left hand, load it.    Dora meanwhile fidgeted about, whining impatiently and wagging her thick  tail.    While my father splashed through the marsh, we drove round the bank  somewhat behind him, and eagerly followed the ranging of the dog, the  getting up of the snipe, and the shooting. My father sometimes shot  fairly well, though he often lost his head, and missed frantically.    But our favorite sport was coursing with greyhounds. What a pleasure  it was when the footman Sergei Petrovitch came in and woke us up before  dawn, with a candle in his hand!    We jumped up full of energy and happiness, trembling all over in the  morning cold; threw on our clothes as quickly as we could, and ran out  into the zala, where the samovar was boiling and papa was waiting for  us.    Sometimes mama came in in her dressing-gown, and made us put on all  sorts of extra woolen stockings, and sweaters and gloves.    \"What are you going to wear, Lyovotchka?\" she would say to papa. \"It's  very cold to-day, and there is a wind. Only the Kuzminsky overcoat again  today? You must put on something underneath, if only for my sake.\"    Papa would make a face, but give in at last, and buckle on his short  gray overcoat under the other and sally forth. It would then be growing  light. Our horses were brought round, we got on, and rode first to \"the  other house,\" or to the kennels to get the dogs.    Agafya Mikhailovna would be anxiously waiting us on the steps. Despite  the coldness of the morning, she would be bareheaded and lightly clad,  with her black jacket open, showing her withered, old bosom. She carried  the dog-collars in her lean, knotted hands.    \"Have you gone and fed them again?\" asks my father, severely, looking at  the dogs' bulging stomachs.    \"Fed them? Not a bit; only just a crust of bread apiece.\"    \"Then what are they licking their chops for?\"    \"There was a bit of yesterday's oatmeal left over.\"    \"I thought as much! All the hares will get away again. It really is too  bad! Do you do it to spite me?\"    \"You can't have the dogs running all day on empty stomachs, Lyoff  Nikolaievich,\" she grunted, going angrily to put on the dogs' collars.    At last the dogs were got together, some of them on leashes, others  running free; and we would ride out at a brisk trot past Bitter Wells  and the grove into the open country.    My father would give the word of command, \"Line out!\" and point out the  direction in which we were to go, and we spread out over the stubble  fields and meadows, whistling and winding about along the lee side of  the steep balks, [8] beating all the bushes with our hunting-crops, and  gazing keenly at every spot or mark on the earth."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#3)"],[1,"river, you may often see a dozen or two of  them sporting amongst the sedges before you.    This warm and humid climate seems particularly adapted to the producing  of insects; it gives birth to myriads, beautiful past description in  their variety of tints, astonishing in their form and size, and many of  them noxious in their qualities.    He whose eye can distinguish the various beauties of uncultivated  nature, and whose ear is not shut to the wild sounds in the woods, will  be delighted in passing up the River Demerara. Every now and then the  maam or tinamou sends forth one long and plaintive whistle from the  depth of the forest, and then stops; whilst the yelping of the toucan  and the shrill voice of the bird called pi-pi-yo is heard during the  interval. The campanero never fails to attract the attention of the  passenger; at a distance of nearly three miles you may hear this  snow-white bird tolling every four or five minutes, like the distant  convent-bell. From six to nine in the morning the forests resound with  the mingled cries and strains of the feathered race; after this they  gradually die away. From eleven to three all nature is hushed as in a  midnight silence, and scarce a note is heard, saving that of the  campanero and the pi-pi-yo; it is then that, oppressed by the solar  heat, the birds retire to the thickest shade and wait for the  refreshing cool of evening.    At sundown the vampires, bats and goat-suckers dart from their lonely  retreat and skim along the trees on the river's bank. The different  kinds of frogs almost stun the ear with their hoarse and  hollow-sounding croaking, while the owls and goat-suckers lament and  mourn all night long.    About two hours before daybreak you will hear the red monkey moaning as  though in deep distress; the houtou, a solitary bird, and only found in  the thickest recesses of the forest, distinctly articulates \"houtou,  houtou,\" in a low and plaintive tone an hour before sunrise; the maam  whistles about the same hour; the hannaquoi, pataca and maroudi  announce his near approach to the eastern horizon, and the parrots and  paroquets confirm his arrival there.    The crickets chirp from sunset to sunrise, and often during the day  when the weather is cloudy. The bete-rouge is exceedingly numerous in  these extensive wilds, and not only man, but beasts and birds, are  tormented by it. Mosquitos are very rare after you pass the third  island in the Demerara, and sand-flies but seldom appear.    Courteous reader, here thou hast the outlines of an amazing landscape  given thee; thou wilt see that the principal parts of it are but  faintly traced, some of them scarcely visible at all, and that the  shades are wholly wanting. If thy soul partakes of the ardent flame  which the persevering Mungo Park's did, these outlines will be enough  for thee; they will give thee some idea of what a noble country this  is; and if thou hast but courage to set about giving the world a  finished picture of it, neither materials to work on nor colours to  paint it in its true shades will be wanting to thee. It may appear a  difficult task at a distance, but look close at it, and it is nothing  at all; provided thou hast but a quiet mind, little more is necessary,  and the genius which presides over these wilds will kindly help thee  through the rest. She will allow thee to slay the fawn and to cut down  the mountain-cabbage for thy support, and to select from every part of  her domain whatever may be necessary for the work thou art about; but  having killed a pair of doves in order to enable thee to give mankind a  true and proper description of them, thou must not destroy a third  through wantonness or to show what a good marksman thou art: that would  only blot the picture thou art finishing, not colour it.    Though retired from the haunts of men, and even without a friend with  thee, thou wouldst not find it solitary. The crowing of the hannaquoi  will sound in thine ears like the daybreak town-clock; and the wren and  the thrush will join with thee in thy matin hymn to thy Creator, to  thank Him for thy night's rest.    At noon the genius will lead thee to the troely, one leaf of which will  defend thee from both sun and rain. And if, in the cool of the evening,  thou hast been tempted to stray too far from thy place of abode, and  art deprived of light to write down the information thou hast  collected, the fire-fly, which thou wilt see in almost every bush  around thee, will be thy candle. Hold it over thy pocket-book, in any  position which thou knowest will not hurt it, and it will afford thee  ample light. And when thou hast done with it, put it kindly back again  on the next branch to thee. It will want no other reward for its  services.    When in thy hammock, should the thought of thy little crosses and  disappointments, in thy ups and downs through life, break in upon thee  and throw thee into a pensive mood, the owl will bear thee company. She  will tell thee that hard has been her fate, too; and at intervals  \"Whip-poor-will\" and \"Willy come go\" will take up the tale of sorrow.  Ovid has told thee how the owl once boasted the human form and lost it  for a very small offence; and were the poet alive now he would inform  thee that \"Whip-poor-will\" and \"Willy come go\" are the shades of those  poor African and Indian slaves who died worn out and broken-hearted.  They wail and cry \"Whip-poor-will,\" \"Willy come go,\" all night long;  and often, when the moon shines, you see them sitting on the green turf  near the houses of those whose ancestors tore them from the bosom of  their helpless families, which all probably perished through grief and  want after their support was gone.    About an hour above the rock of Saba stands the habitation of an Indian  called Simon, on the top of a hill. The side next the river is almost  perpendicular, and you may easily throw a stone over to the opposite  bank. Here there was an opportunity of seeing man in his rudest state.  The Indians who frequented this habitation, though living in the midst  of woods, bore evident marks of attention to their persons. Their hair  was neatly collected and tied up in a knot; their bodies fancifully  painted red, and the paint was scented with hayawa. This gave them a  gay and animated appearance. Some of them had on necklaces composed of  the teeth of wild boars slain in the chase; many wore rings, and others  had an ornament on the left arm midway betwixt the shoulder and the  elbow. At the close of day they regularly bathed in the river below,  and the next morning seemed busy in renewing the faded colours of their  faces.    One day there came into the hut a form which literally might be called  the wild man of the woods. On entering he laid down a ball of wax which  he had collected in the forest. His hammock was all ragged and torn,  and his bow, though of good wood, was without any ornament or polish:  \"erubuit domino, cultior esse suo.\" His face was meagre, his looks  forbidding and his whole appearance neglected. His long black hair hung  from his head in matted confusion; nor had his body, to all appearance,  ever been painted. They gave him some cassava bread and boiled fish,  which he ate voraciously, and soon after left the hut. As he went out  you could observe no traces in his countenance or demeanour which  indicated that he was in the least mindful of having been benefited by  the society he was just leaving.    The Indians said that he had neither wife nor child nor friend. They  had often tried to persuade him to come and live amongst them, but all  was of no avail. He went roving on, plundering the wild bees of their  honey and picking up the fallen nuts and fruits of the forest. When he  fell in with game he procured fire from two sticks and cooked it on the  spot. When a hut happened to be in his way he stepped in and asked for  something to eat, and then months elapsed ere they saw him again. They  did not know what had caused him to be thus unsettled: he had been so  for years; nor did they believe that even old age itself would change  the habits of this poor harmless, solitary wanderer.    From Simon's the traveller may reach the large fall, with ease, in four  days.    The first falls that he meets are merely rapids, scarce a stone  appearing above the water in the rainy season; and those in the bed of  the river barely high enough to arrest the water's course, and by  causing a bubbling show that they are there.    With this small change of appearance in the stream, the stranger  observes nothing new till he comes within eight or ten miles of the  great fall. Each side of the river presents an uninterrupted range of  wood, just as it did below. All the productions found betwixt the  plantations and the rock Saba are to be met with here.    From Simon's to the great fall there are five habitations of the  Indians: two of them close to the river's side; the other three a  little way in the forest. These habitations consist of from four to  eight huts, situated on about an acre of ground which they have cleared  from the surrounding woods. A few pappaw, cotton and mountain-cabbage  trees are scattered round them.    At one of these habitations a small quantity of the wourali poison was  procured. It was in a little gourd. The Indian who had it said that he  had killed a number of wild hogs with it, and two tapirs. Appearances  seemed to confirm what he said, for on one side it had been nearly  taken out to the bottom, at different times, which probably would not  have been the case had the first or second trial failed.    Its strength was proved on a middle-sized dog. He was wounded in the  thigh, in order that there might be no possibility of touching a vital  part. In three or four minutes he began to be affected, smelt at every  little thing on the ground around him, and looked wistfully at the  wounded part. Soon after this he staggered, laid himself"]]]
