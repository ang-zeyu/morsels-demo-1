In consequence of this examination, our authoress was close shut up  in a messenger's house, without being allowed pen, ink, and paper.  However her council sued out her Habeas Corpus at the King's-Bench  Bar, and she was admitted to bail.    Whether those in power were ashamed to bring a woman to her trial,  for writing a few amorous trifles, or our laws were defective, as  was generally conjectured, because she had disguised her satire under  romantic names, and a feigned scene of action, she was discharged,  after several times exposing her in person, to cross the court before  the Bench of Judges, with her three attendants, the Printer, and two  Publishers.    Not long after this a total change of the ministry ensued,  the statesmen to whom she had been obnoxious were removed, and  consequently all her fears upon that score dissipated; her native  gaiety, and good humour returned, and she again employed herself in  writing a tragedy for the stage, and resolved never more to deal in  politics, as being much out of the natural sphere of a woman, she was  persuaded it was folly in one in her station, to disoblige any party  by a pen, equally qualified to divert all. Being advanced to the  autumn of her charms, she conversed with the opposite sex, in a manner  very delicate, sensible, and agreeable, and when she felt that time  had left his impression upon her brow, she did not court praise and  flattery. The greatest genius's of the times conversed freely with  her, and gave her daily proofs of esteem, and friendship, except Sir  Richard Steele, with whom it seems she was at variance; and indeed Sir  Richard sufficiently exposed himself by his manner of taking revenge;  for he published to the world that it was his own fault he was not  happy with Mrs. Manley, for which omission he publickly, and gravely  asked her pardon.    Those are the most material incidents in the life of our poetess; a  lady, who was born with high powers from nature, which were afterwards  cultivated by enjoying the brightest conversation; the early part of  her life was unfortunate, she fell a sacrifice to a seducer, who laid  the foundation for those errors she afterwards committed, and of those  sufferings she underwent; she had a high relish for the pleasures  of life; she was extremely susceptible of the passion of love, and  treated it with a peculiar vivacity.    Her dramatic works are    1. The Lover, or The Jealous Husband; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1696.  This play did not succeed in the representation.    2. The Royal Mischief, a Tragedy; acted by his Majesty's Servants  in the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1696. This was exhibited with  general applause.    3. Lucius, the First Christian King of Britain, a Tragedy; acted  at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane by his Majesty's Servants, and  dedicated to Sir Richard Steele. She has written several poems, and  we shall select, as a specimen, an Epistle to the Countess of Bristol,  which will shew how much she possessed the power of delicate numbers;  she has also in print a volume of Letters, the second edition of which  was published in 1713. She died July 11, 1724.      To the Right Honourable the    Countess of BRISTOL.          Long had my mind, unknowing how to soar,    In humble prose been train'd, nor aim'd at more:    Near the fam'd sisters never durst aspire    To sound a verse, or touch the tuneful lyre.    'Till Bristol's charms dissolv'd the native cold;    Bad me survey her eyes, and thence be bold.    Thee, lovely Bristol! thee! with pride I chuse,    The first, and only subject of my muse;    That durst transport me like the bird of Jove,    To face th' immortal source of light above!    Such are thy kindred beams--    So blessings, with a bounteous hand they give,    So they create, and make creation live.        When charming Felton, of a beauteous race,    Adorn'd in blooming youth, with ev'ry grace;    First saw the lovely Suffolk Swain her prize,    The noblest conquest of the brightest eyes!    How many wretched nymphs that union made,    What cold despair the warmest hearts invade!    What crouds of lovers, hopeless and undone,    Deplore those charms which brought their ruin on!    Rich in themselves--all excellence they find,    Wit! beauty! wisdom! and a constant mind!    No vain desires of change disturb their joy;    Such sweets, like bliss divine, can never cloy:    Fill'd with that spirit which great souls inflame,    Their wondrous offspring start to early fame.    In their young minds, immortal sparkles rise!    And all their mother flashes from their eyes!    From thence such scenes of beauty charm the sight,    We know not where o fix the strong delight!    Hervey's soft features--next, Eliza bright!    Anna just dawning, like Aurora's light!    With all the smiling train of Cupids round,    Fond little loves, with flowing graces crown'd.        As some fair flowers, who all their bloom disclose,    The Spanish Jas'min, or the British Rose?    Arriv'd at full perfection, charm the sense,    Whilst the young blossoms gradual sweets dispense.    The eldest born, with almost equal pride;    The next appears in fainter colours dy'd:    New op'ning buds, as less in debt to time,    Wait to perform the promise of their prime!    All blest descendants of the beauteous tree,    What now their parent is, themselves shall be.        Oh! could I paint the younger Hervey's mind,    Where wit and judgment, fire and taste refin'd    To match his face, with equal art are join'd:    Oh best belov'd of Jove! to thee alone,    What would enrich the whole, he gives to one!        [A]In Titian's colours whilst Adonis glows,    See fairest Bristol more than Venus shows;    View well the valu'd piece, how nice each part;    Yet nature's hand surpasses Titian's art!    Such had his Venus and Adonis been,    The standard beauty had from thence been seen!    Whose arbitrary laws had fix'd the doom    To Hervey's form, and Bristol's ever bloom!        [B]As once Kazeia, now Eliza warms    The kindred-fair bequeath'd her all her charms;    Such were her darts, so piercing and so strong,    Endow'd by Phoebus both, with tuneful song;    But far from thee Eliza be her doom;    Snatch'd hence by death, in all her beauty's bloom.    Long may'st thou live, adorning Bristol's name,    With future heroes to augment his fame.        When haughty Niobe, with joy and pride,    Saw all her shining offspring grace her side;    She view'd their charms, exulting at each line,    And then oppos'd 'em to the race divine!    Enrag'd Latona urg'd the silver bow:    Immortal vengeance laid their beauties low.    No more a mother now--too much she mourn'd,    By grief incessant into marble turn'd.        But lovely Bristol, with a pious mind,    Owns all her blessings are from Heav'n assign'd.    Her matchless Lord--her beauteous numerous race!    Her virtue, modesty, and ev'ry grace!    For these, devoutly, to the gods she bows,    And offers daily praise, and daily vows:    Phoebus, well-pleas'd, the sacrifice regards;    And thus the grateful mother's zeal rewards:    'Beauty and wit, to all of Bristol's line!    But each in some peculiar grace shall shine!    Or to excel in courts, and please the fair!    Or Conquest gain thro' all the wat'ry war!    With harmony divine the ear to charm!    Or souls with more melodious numbers warm!    By wond'rous memory shall some excel    In awful senates, and in speaking well!    To hold Astraea's scales with equal hand,    And call back justice to that happy land!    To teach mankind how best the gods to praise!    To fix their minds in truth's unerring ways!        'Thus all her honours, Bristol's sons shall wear,    Whilst each his country's good shall make his chiefest care!'

He was removed  from thence in 1705, and in 1708 accepted a small place in a public  office; where he continued the remainder of his days.    About this time contracting a friendship with a gentleman of a like  taste, who furnished him with proper books, he applied himself at  his intervals of leisure, to reading the dailies, and to the study  of logic, metaphysics, and the mathematics, with which last he was  peculiarly delighted. And in a few years by the force of his own happy  genius, and unwearied diligence, without the assistance of any master,  he acquired a considerable knowledge of the most difficult branches of  those useful and entertaining studies.    By so close an application, he contracted a violent pain in his head,  which notwithstanding the best advice, daily encreased. This, and  other unfortunate circumstances concurring, so deeply affected him,  who had besides in his constitution a strong tincture of melancholy,  that he was at last brought under almost a total extinction of reason.  In this condition he fell into a fever; and as there were before  scarce any hopes of him, it may be said to have happily put an end to  the deplorable bondage of so bright a mind, on the 21st of December,  1718, in the 29th year of his age. He was buried in the church of  Friendsbury, near Rochester.    Mr. Needler's life was influenced by the principles of sincere,  unaffected piety, and virtue.    On all occasions (says Mr. Duncomb) 'he was a strenuous advocate for  universal toleration and forbearance in matters of religion; rightly  supposing that no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12017"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13 — Index to (#4)"],[1,"-\"These pages formed the occupation of the  Author during several months of severe and dangerous illness, when he was  wholly incapable of attending to more useful studies, or of following  more serious pursuits. They formed his amusement in many hours, which  otherwise would have been unoccupied and tedious.\" \"The conversational  and discursive style were chosen as best suited to the state of the  health of the author, who was incapable of considerable efforts and long  continued exertion.\" The volume is dedicated to Dr. Babington, \"in  remembrance of some delightful days passed in his society, and in  gratitude for an uninterrupted friendship of quarter of a century:\" and  the likeness of one of the characters in the conversations to that  estimable physician abovenamed, has been considered well drawn, and  easily recognisable by those who enjoy his acquaintance.    The philosophical works of Sir Humphry Davy are written in a clear and  perspicuous style, by which means he has contributed more to the  diffusion of scientific knowledge than any other writer of his time. His  three principal works, \"Chemical and Philosophical Researches,\" \"Elements  of Chemical Philosophy,\" and \"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry,\" are in  a popular and familiar style, and the two last are excellently adapted  for elementary study. His numerous pamphlets and contributions to the  Transactions of the Royal Society have the same rare merit of conveying  experimental knowledge in the most attractive form, and thus reducing  abstract theory to the practice and purposes of life and society. The  results of his investigations and experiments were not therefore pent up  in the laboratory or lecture-room where they were made, but by this  valuable mode of communication, they have realized what ought to be the  highest aim of science,--the improvement of the condition and comforts of  every class of his fellow-creatures. Thus, beautiful theories were  illustrated by inventions of immediate utility, as in the safety-lamp for  mitigating the dangers to which miners are exposed in their labours, and  the application of a newly-discovered principle in preserving the life of  the adventurous mariner. Yet splendid as were Sir Humphry's talents, and  important as have been their application, he received the honours and  homage of the scientific world with that becoming modesty which  universally characterizes great genius.    Apart from the scientific value of Sir Humphry's labours and researches,  they are pervaded by a tone and temper, and an enthusiastic love of  nature which are as admirably expressed as their influence is excellent.  In proof of this feeling we could almost from memory, quote many  passages from his works. Thus, speaking of the divine _Study of Nature_,  he has the following reflective truths:--\"If we look with wonder upon  the great remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken  in the midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the  decay of twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture  in the Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the  genius of artists, and power and riches of nations now past away; with  how much deeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand  monuments of Nature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents  broken into islands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of  the ocean become a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the  bones and exuviae of one class, covered with the remains of another, and  upon the graves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it  were, of a former animated world--new generations rising, and order and  harmony established, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it  were out of chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and  goodness, of the GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!\" Here we cannot trace any  co-mixture of science and scepticism, and in vain shall we look for the  spawn of infidel doctrine. The same excellent feeling breathes  throughout _Salmonia_, one of the most delightful labours of leisure we  have ever seen. Not a few of the most beautiful phenomena of Nature are  here lucidly explained, yet the pages have none of the varnish of  philosophical unbelief or finite reasoning. \"In my opinion,\" says one of  the characters in the Dialogue, (to be identified as the author,)  \"profound minds are the most likely to think lightly of the resources of  human reason; and it is the pert superficial thinker who is generally  strongest in every kind of unbelief. The deep philosopher sees changes  of causes and effects, so wonderfully and strangely linked together,  that he is usually the last person to decide upon the impossibility of  any two series of events being independent of each other; and in  science, so many natural miracles, as it were, have been brought to  light,--such as the fall of stones from meteors in the atmosphere, the  disarming a thundercloud by a metallic point, the production of fire  from ice by a metal white as silver, and referring certain laws of  motions of the sea to the moon,--that the physical inquirer is seldom  disposed to assert, confidently, on any abstruse subjects belonging to  the order of natural things, and still less so on those relating to the  more mysterious relations of moral events and intellectual natures.\"[7]    Many other passages in _Salmonia_ gush forth with great force and beauty,  and sometimes soar into sublime truths. Thus says the eloquent author:    \"A full and clear river is, in my opinion, the most poetical object in  nature. Pliny has, as well as I recollect, compared a river to human life.  I have never read the passage in his works, but I have been a hundred  times struck with the analogy, particularly amidst mountain scenery. The  river, small and clear in its origin, gushes forth from rocks, falls into  deep glens, and wantons and meanders through a wild and picturesque  country, nourishing only the uncultivated tree or flower by its dew or  spray. In this, its state of infancy and youth, it may be compared to the  human mind in which fancy and strength of imagination are predominant--it  is more beautiful than useful. When the different rills or torrents join,  and descend into the plain, it becomes slow and stately in its motions;  it is applied to move machinery, to irrigate meadows, and to bear upon  its bosom the stately barge;--in this mature state, it is deep, strong,  and useful. As it flows on towards the sea, it loses its force and its  motion, and at last, as it were, becomes lost and mingled with the mighty  abyss of waters.\"    \"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in others; not genius, power,  wit, or fancy: but if I could choose what would be most delightful, and I  believe most useful to me, I should prefer a firm religious belief to  every other blessing; for it makes life a discipline of goodness--creates  new hopes, when all earthly hopes vanish; and throws over the decay, the  destruction of existence, the most gorgeous of all lights; awakens life  even in death, and from corruption and decay calls up beauty and divinity:  makes an instrument of torture and of shame the ladder of ascent to  paradise; and, far above all combinations of earthly hopes, calls up the  most delightful visions of palms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest,  the security of everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic  view only gloom, decay, annihilation, and despair!\"    Few of those whose fame and fortune are their own creation, enjoy, as did  Sir Humphry Davy, in the meridian of life, the enviable consciousness of  general esteem and respect, and the certainty of a distinguished place in  history, among the illustrious names of their country. \"A great light has  gone out,\"--short but brilliant has been his career; yet let us hope he  has but exchanged his worldly fame for unearthly immortality, to shine  amidst the never-dying lights of true glory.

[5] These experiments, the last which engaged Sir Humphry Davy's      attention to any extent, were on the application of electrical      combinations, for the purpose of preserving the copper sheathing of      ships' bottoms. To this subject Sir Humphry gave much of his time,      and personally inspected all the boats and vessels on which the      trials were made. Although the theory upon which they were conducted      proved eminently correct, no advantage could be ultimately taken of      the plans which it suggested. The saving of the copper was wholly      counterbalanced by an accumulation of shell-fish and sea-weed on the      sheathing, which became sufficient, in a short time, to prevent the      proper command of the ship at the helm.
