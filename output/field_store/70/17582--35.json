I ask you to learn how to \"conquer nature by   obeying her,\" as the great Lord Bacon said two hundred and fifty   years ago.  For so only will you in your theories and your movements,   draw \"bills which nature will honour\"--to use Mr. Carlyle's famous   parable--because they are according to her unchanging laws, and not   have them returned on your hands, as too many theorists' are, with   \"no effects\" written across their backs.    Take my advice for yourselves, dear readers, and for your children   after you; for, believe me, I am showing you the way to true and   useful, and, therefore, to just and deserved power.  I am showing you   the way to become members of what I trust will be--what I am certain   ought to be--the aristocracy of the future.    I say it deliberately, as a student of society and of history.  Power   will pass more and more, if all goes healthily and well, into the   hands of scientific men; into the hands of those who have made due   use of that great heirloom which the philosophers of the seventeenth   century left for the use of future generations, and specially of the   Teutonic race.    For the rest, events seem but too likely to repeat themselves again   and again all over the world, in the same hopeless circle.    Aristocracies of mere birth decay and die, and give place to   aristocracies of mere wealth; and they again to \"aristocracies of   genius,\" which are really aristocracies of the noisiest, of mere   scribblers and spouters, such as France is writhing under at this   moment.  And when these last have blown off their steam, with mighty   roar, but without moving the engine a single yard, then they are but   too likely to give place to the worst of all aristocracies, the   aristocracy of mere \"order,\" which means organised brute force and   military despotism.  And, after that, what can come, save anarchy,   and decay, and social death?    What else?--unless there be left in the nation, in the society, as   the salt of the land, to keep it all from rotting, a sufficient   number of wise men to form a true working aristocracy, an aristocracy   of sound and rational science?  If they be strong enough (and they   are growing stronger day by day over the civilised world), on them   will the future of that world mainly depend.  They will rule, and   they will act--cautiously we may hope, and modestly and charitably,   because in learning true knowledge they will have learnt also their   own ignorance, and the vastness, the complexity, the mystery of   nature.  But they will be able to rule, they will be able to act,   because they have taken the trouble to learn the facts and the laws   of nature.  They will rule; and their rule, if they are true to   themselves, will be one of health and wealth, and peace, of prudence   and of justice.  For they alone will be able to wield for the benefit   of man the brute forces of nature; because they alone will have   stooped, to \"conquer nature by obeying her.\"    So runs my dream.  I ask my young readers to help towards making that   dream a fact, by becoming (as many of them as feel the justice of my   words) honest and earnest students of Natural Science.    But now:  why should I, as a clergyman, interest myself specially in   the spread of Natural Science?  Am I not going out of my proper   sphere to meddle with secular matters?  Am I not, indeed, going into   a sphere out of which I had better keep myself, and all over whom I   may have influence?  For is not science antagonistic to religion?   and, if so, what has a clergyman to do, save to warn the young   against it, instead of attracting them towards it?    First, as to meddling with secular matters.  I grudge that epithet of   \"secular\" to any matter whatsoever.  But I do more; I deny it to   anything which God has made, even to the tiniest of insects, the most   insignificant atom of dust.  To those who believe in God, and try to   see all things in God, the most minute natural phenomenon cannot be   secular.  It must be divine; I say, deliberately, divine; and I can   use no less lofty word.  The grain of dust is a thought of God; God's   power made it; God's wisdom gave it whatsoever properties or   qualities it may possess; God's providence has put it in the place   where it is now, and has ordained that it should be in that place at   that moment, by a train of causes and effects which reaches back to   the very creation of the universe.  The grain of dust can no more go   from God's presence, or flee from God's Spirit, than you or I can.    If it go up to the physical heaven, and float (as it actually often   does) far above the clouds, in those higher strata of the atmosphere   which the aeronaut has never visited, whither the Alpine snow-peaks   do not rise, even there it will be obeying physical laws which we   term hastily laws of Nature, but which are really the laws of God:    and if it go down into the physical abyss; if it be buried fathoms,   miles, below the surface, and become an atom of some rock still in   the process of consolidation, has it escaped from God, even in the   bowels of the earth?  Is it not there still obeying physical laws, of   pressure, heat, crystallisation, and so forth, which are laws of God-  -the will and mind of God concerning particles of matter?  Only look   at all created things in this light--look at them as what they are,   the expressions of God's mind and will concerning this universe in   which we live--\"the Word of God,\" as Bacon says, \"revealed in facts\"-  -and then you will not fear physical science; for you will be sure   that, the more you know of physical science, the more you will know   of the works and of the will of God.  At least, you will be in   harmony with the teaching of the Psalmist:  \"The heavens,\" says he,   \"declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.    There is neither speech nor language where their voices are not heard   among them.\"  So held the Psalmist concerning astronomy, the   knowledge of the heavenly bodies; and what he says of sun and stars   is true likewise of the flowers around our feet, of which the   greatest Christian poet of modern times has said--      To me the meanest flower that grows may give  Thoughts that do lie too deep for tears.      So, again, you will be in harmony with the teaching of St. Paul, who   told the Romans \"that the invisible things of God are clearly seen   from the creation of the-world, being understood by the things that   are made, even His eternal power and Godhead;\" and who told the   savages of Lycaonia that \"God had not left Himself without witness,   in that He did good and sent men rain from heaven, and fruitful   seasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness.\"  Rain and   fruitful seasons witnessed to all men of a Father in heaven.  And he   who wishes to know how truly St. Paul spoke, let him study the laws   which produce and regulate rain and fruitful seasons, what we now   call climatology, meteorology, geography of land and water.  Let him   read that truly noble Christian work, Maury's \"Physical Geography of   the Sea;\" and see, if he be a truly rational man, how advanced   science, instead of disproving, has only corroborated St. Paul's   assertion, and how the ocean and the rain-cloud, like the sun and   stars, declare the glory of God.  And if anyone undervalues the   sciences which teach us concerning stones and plants and animals, or   thinks that nothing can be learnt from them concerning God--allow one   who has been from childhood only a humble, though he trusts a   diligent student of these sciences--allow him, I say, to ask in all   reverence, but in all frankness, who it was who said, \"Consider the   lilies of the field, how they grow.\"  \"Consider the birds of the air-  -and how your Heavenly Father feedeth them.\"    Consider them.  If He has bid you do so, can you do so too much?    I know, of course, the special application which our Lord made of   these words.  But I know, too, from experience, that the more you   study nature, in all her forms the more you will find that the   special application itself is deeper, wider, more literally true,   more wonderful, more tender, and if I dare use such a word, more   poetic, than the unscientific man can guess.    But let me ask you further--do you think that our Lord in that   instance, and in those many instances in which He drew his parables   and lessons from natural objects, was leading men's minds on to   dangerous ground, and pointing out to them a subject of contemplation   in the laws and processes of the natural world, and their analogy   with those of the spiritual world, the kingdom of God--a subject of   contemplation, I say, which it was not safe to contemplate too much?    I appeal to your common sense.  If He who spoke these words were (as   I believe) none other than the Creator of the universe, by whom all   things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made, do   you suppose that He would have bid you to consider His universe, had   it been dangerous for you to do so?    Do you suppose, moreover, that the universe, which He, the Truth, the   Light, the Love, has made, can be otherwise then infinitely worthy to   be considered? or that the careful, accurate, and patient   consideration of it, even to its minutest details, can be otherwise   than useful to man, and can bear witness of aught, save the mind and   character of Him who made it?  And if so, can it be a work unfit for,   unworthy of, a clergyman--whose duty is to preach Him to all, and in   all ways,--to call on men to consider that physical world which, like   the spiritual world, consists, holds together, by Him, and lives and   moves and has its being in Him?

They had found his trail. He spurred his horse  straight into the brush. At the second crashing bound there came yells  from the road, and then shots. Duane heard the hiss of a bullet close  by his ear, and as it struck a branch it made a peculiar singing sound.  These shots and the proximity of that lead missile roused in Duane a  quick, hot resentment which mounted into a passion almost ungovernable.  He must escape, yet it seemed that he did not care whether he did or  not. Something grim kept urging him to halt and return the fire of these  men. After running a couple of hundred yards he raised himself from over  the pommel, where he had bent to avoid the stinging branches, and tried  to guide his horse. In the dark shadows under mesquites and cottonwoods  he was hard put to it to find open passage; however, he succeeded so  well and made such little noise that gradually he drew away from his  pursuers. The sound of their horses crashing through the thickets died  away. Duane reined in and listened. He had distanced them. Probably they  would go into camp till daylight, then follow his tracks. He started on  again, walking his horse, and peered sharply at the ground, so that he  might take advantage of the first trail he crossed. It seemed a long  while until he came upon one. He followed it until a late hour, when,  striking the willow brakes again and hence the neighborhood of the  river, he picketed his horse and lay down to rest. But he did not sleep.  His mind bitterly revolved the fate that had come upon him. He made  efforts to think of other things, but in vain.    Every moment he expected the chill, the sense of loneliness that yet  was ominous of a strange visitation, the peculiarly imagined lights and  shades of the night--these things that presaged the coming of Cal Bain.  Doggedly Duane fought against the insidious phantom. He kept telling  himself that it was just imagination, that it would wear off in time.  Still in his heart he did not believe what he hoped. But he would not  give up; he would not accept the ghost of his victim as a reality.    Gray dawn found him in the saddle again headed for the river. Half an  hour of riding brought him to the dense chaparral and willow thickets.  These he threaded to come at length to the ford. It was a gravel bottom,  and therefore an easy crossing. Once upon the opposite shore he  reined in his horse and looked darkly back. This action marked his  acknowledgment of his situation: he had voluntarily sought the refuge  of the outlaws; he was beyond the pale. A bitter and passionate curse  passed his lips as he spurred his horse into the brakes on that alien  shore.    He rode perhaps twenty miles, not sparing his horse nor caring whether  or not he left a plain trail.    \"Let them hunt me!\" he muttered.    When the heat of the day began to be oppressive, and hunger and thirst  made themselves manifest, Duane began to look about him for a place to  halt for the noon-hours. The trail led into a road which was hard packed  and smooth from the tracks of cattle. He doubted not that he had come  across one of the roads used by border raiders. He headed into it, and  had scarcely traveled a mile when, turning a curve, he came point-blank  upon a single horseman riding toward him. Both riders wheeled their  mounts sharply and were ready to run and shoot back. Not more than a  hundred paces separated them. They stood then for a moment watching each  other.    \"Mawnin', stranger,\" called the man, dropping his hand from his hip.    \"Howdy,\" replied Duane, shortly.    They rode toward each other, closing half the gap, then they halted  again.    \"I seen you ain't no ranger,\" called the rider, \"an' shore I ain't  none.\"    He laughed loudly, as if he had made a joke.    \"How'd you know I wasn't a ranger?\" asked Duane, curiously. Somehow  he had instantly divined that his horseman was no officer, or even a  rancher trailing stolen stock.    \"Wal,\" said the fellow, starting his horse forward at a walk, \"a  ranger'd never git ready to run the other way from one man.\"    He laughed again. He was small and wiry, slouchy of attire, and armed to  the teeth, and he bestrode a fine bay horse. He had quick, dancing brown  eyes, at once frank and bold, and a coarse, bronzed face. Evidently he  was a good-natured ruffian.    Duane acknowledged the truth of the assertion, and turned over in his  mind how shrewdly the fellow had guessed him to be a hunted man.    \"My name's Luke Stevens, an' I hail from the river. Who're you?\" said  this stranger.    Duane was silent.    \"I reckon you're Buck Duane,\" went on Stevens. \"I heerd you was a damn  bad man with a gun.\"    This time Duane laughed, not at the doubtful compliment, but at the  idea that the first outlaw he met should know him. Here was proof of how  swiftly facts about gun-play traveled on the Texas border.    \"Wal, Buck,\" said Stevens, in a friendly manner, \"I ain't presumin' on  your time or company. I see you're headin' fer the river. But will you  stop long enough to stake a feller to a bite of grub?\"    \"I'm out of grub, and pretty hungry myself,\" admitted Duane.    \"Been pushin' your hoss, I see. Wal, I reckon you'd better stock up  before you hit thet stretch of country.\"    He made a wide sweep of his right arm, indicating the southwest, and  there was that in his action which seemed significant of a vast and  barren region.    \"Stock up?\" queried Duane, thoughtfully.    \"Shore. A feller has jest got to eat. I can rustle along without whisky,  but not without grub. Thet's what makes it so embarrassin' travelin'  these parts dodgin' your shadow. Now, I'm on my way to Mercer. It's  a little two-bit town up the river a ways. I'm goin' to pack out some  grub.\"    Stevens's tone was inviting. Evidently he would welcome Duane's  companionship, but he did not openly say so. Duane kept silence,  however, and then Stevens went on.    \"Stranger, in this here country two's a crowd. It's safer. I never was  much on this lone-wolf dodgin', though I've done it of necessity. It  takes a damn good man to travel alone any length of time. Why, I've been  thet sick I was jest achin' fer some ranger to come along an' plug me.  Give me a pardner any day. Now, mebbe you're not thet kind of a  feller, an' I'm shore not presumin' to ask. But I just declares myself  sufficient.\"    \"You mean you'd like me to go with you?\" asked Duane.    Stevens grinned. \"Wal, I should smile. I'd be particular proud to be  braced with a man of your reputation.\"    \"See here, my good fellow, that's all nonsense,\" declared Duane, in some  haste.    \"Shore I think modesty becomin' to a youngster,\" replied Stevens. \"I  hate a brag. An' I've no use fer these four-flush cowboys thet 're  always lookin' fer trouble an' talkin' gun-play. Buck, I don't know much  about you. But every man who's lived along the Texas border remembers a  lot about your Dad. It was expected of you, I reckon, an' much of your  rep was established before you thronged your gun. I jest heerd thet you  was lightnin' on the draw, an' when you cut loose with a gun, why the  figger on the ace of spades would cover your cluster of bullet-holes.  Thet's the word thet's gone down the border. It's the kind of reputation  most sure to fly far an' swift ahead of a man in this country. An' the  safest, too; I'll gamble on thet. It's the land of the draw. I see now  you're only a boy, though you're shore a strappin' husky one. Now,  Buck, I'm not a spring chicken, an' I've been long on the dodge. Mebbe  a little of my society won't hurt you none. You'll need to learn the  country.\"    There was something sincere and likable about this outlaw.    \"I dare say you're right,\" replied Duane, quietly. \"And I'll go to  Mercer with you.\"    Next moment he was riding down the road with Stevens. Duane had never  been much of a talker, and now he found speech difficult. But his  companion did not seem to mind that. He was a jocose, voluble fellow,  probably glad now to hear the sound of his own voice. Duane listened,  and sometimes he thought with a pang of the distinction of name and  heritage of blood his father had left to him.        CHAPTER III    Late that day, a couple of hours before sunset, Duane and Stevens,  having rested their horses in the shade of some mesquites near the town  of Mercer, saddled up and prepared to move.    \"Buck, as we're lookin' fer grub, an' not trouble, I reckon you'd better  hang up out here,\" Stevens was saying, as he mounted. \"You see, towns  an' sheriffs an' rangers are always lookin' fer new fellers gone bad.  They sort of forget most of the old boys, except those as are plumb  bad. Now, nobody in Mercer will take notice of me. Reckon there's been  a thousand men run into the river country to become outlaws since yours  truly. You jest wait here an' be ready to ride hard. Mebbe my besettin'  sin will go operatin' in spite of my good intentions. In which case  there'll be--\"    His pause was significant. He grinned, and his brown eyes danced with a  kind of wild humor.    \"Stevens, have you got any money?\" asked Duane.    \"Money!\" exclaimed Luke, blankly. \"Say, I haven't owned a two-bit piece  since--wal, fer some time.\"    \"I'll furnish money for grub,\" returned Duane. \"And for whisky, too,  providing you hurry back here--without making trouble.\"    \"Shore you're a downright good pard,\" declared Stevens, in admiration,  as he took the money. \"I give my word, Buck, an' I'm here to say I never  broke it yet. Lay low, an' look fer me back quick.\"    With that he spurred his horse and rode out of the mesquites toward the  town. At that distance, about a quarter of a mile, Mercer appeared to be  a cluster of low adobe houses set in a grove of cottonwoods. Pastures  of alfalfa were dotted by horses and cattle. Duane saw a sheep-herder  driving in a meager flock.    Presently Stevens rode out of sight into the town. Duane waited, hoping  the outlaw"]]]
