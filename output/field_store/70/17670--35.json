Two treaties, one of November 7, 1515, and the other of  November 29, 1516, re-established not only peace, but perpetual alliance,  between the King of France and the thirteen Swiss cantons, with  stipulated conditions in detail.  Whilst these negotiations were in  progress, Francis I. and Leo X., by a treaty published at Viterbo on the  13th of October, proclaimed their hearty reconciliation.  The pope  guaranteed to Francis I. the duchy of Milan, restored to him those of  Parma and Piacenza, and recalled his troops which were still serving  against the Venetians; being careful, however, to cover his concessions  by means of forms and pretexts which gave them the character of a  necessity submitted to rather than that of an independent and definite  engagement.  Francis I., on his side, guaranteed to the pope all the  possessions of the church, renounced the patronage of the petty princes  of the ecclesiastical estate, and promised to uphold the family of the  Medici in the position it had held at Florence since, with the King of  Spain's aid, in 1512, it had recovered the dominion there at the expense  of the party of republicans and friends of France.    The King of France and the pope had to discuss together questions far  more important on both sides than those which had just been thus settled  by their accredited agents.  When they signed the treaty of Viterbo, it  was agreed that the two sovereigns should have a personal interview, at  which they should come to an arrangement upon points of which they had as  yet said nothing.  Rome seemed the place most naturally adapted for this  interview; but the pope did not wish that Francis I. should go and  display his triumph there.  Besides, he foresaw that the king would speak  to him about the kingdom of Naples, the conquest of which was evidently  premeditated by the king; and when Francis I., having arrived at Rome,  had already done half the journey, Leo X. feared that it would be more  difficult to divert him.  He resolved to make to the king a show of  deference to conceal his own disquietude; and offered to go and meet him  at Bologna, the town in the Roman States which was nearest to Milaness.  Francis accepted the offer.  The pope arrived at Bologna on the 8th of  December, 1515, and the king the next day.  After the public ceremonies,  at which the king showed eagerness to tender to the pope acts of homage  which the pope was equally eager to curtail without repelling them, the  two sovereigns conversed about the two questions which were uppermost in  their minds.  Francis did not attempt to hide his design of reconquering  the kingdom of Naples, which Ferdinand the Catholic had wrongfully  usurped, and he demanded the pope's countenance.  The pope did not care  to refuse, but he pointed out to the king that everything foretold the  very near death of King Ferdinand; and \"Your majesty,\" said he, \"will  then have a natural opportunity for claiming your rights; and as for me,  free, as I shall then be, from my engagements with the King of Arragon in  respect of the crown of Naples, I shall find it easier to respond to your  majesty's wish.\"  The pope merely wanted to gain time.  Francis, setting  aside for the moment the kingdom of Naples, spoke of Charles VII.'s  Pragmatic Sanction, and the necessity of putting an end to the  difficulties which had arisen on this subject between the court of Rome  and the Kings of France, his predecessors.  \"As to that,\" said the pope,  \"I could not grant what your predecessors demanded; but be not uneasy;  I have a compensation to propose to you which will prove to you how dear  your interests are to me.\"  The two sovereigns had, without doubt,  already come to an understanding on this point, when, after a three days'  interview with Leo X., Francis I. returned to Milan, leaving at Bologna,  for the purpose of treating in detail the affair of the Pragmatic  Sanction, his chancellor, Duprat, who had accompanied him during all this  campaign as his adviser and negotiator.    In him the king had, under the name and guise of premier magistrate of  the realm, a servant whose bold and complacent abilities he was not slow  to recognize and to put in use.  Being irritated \"for that many, not  having the privilege of sportsmen, do take beasts, both red and black, as  hares, pheasants, partridges, and other game, thus frustrating us of our  diversion and pastime that we take in the chase,\" Francis I. issued, in  March, 1516, an ordinance which decreed against poachers the most severe  penalties, and even death, and which \"granted to all princes, lords, and  gentlemen possessing forests or warrens in the realm, the right of  upholding therein by equally severe punishments the exclusive privileges  of their preserves.\"  The Parliament made remonstrances against such  excessive rigor, and refused to register the ordinance.  The chancellor,  Duprat, insisted, and even threatened.  \"To the king alone,\" said he,  \"belongs the right of regulating the administration of his state obey, or  the king will see in you only rebels, whom he will know how to chastise.\"  For a year the Parliament held out; but the chancellor persisted more  obstinately in having his way, and, on the 11th of February, 1517, the  ordinance was registered under a formal order from the king, to which the  name was given of \"letters of command.\"    [Illustration: Anthony Duprat----24]    At the commencement of the war for the conquest of Milaness there was a  want of money, and Francis I.  hesitated to so soon impose new taxes.  Duprat gave a scandalous extension to a practice which had been for a  long while in use, but had always been reprobated and sometimes formally  prohibited, namely, the sale of public appointments or offices: not only  did he create a multitude of financial and administrative offices, the  sale of which brought considerable sums into the treasury, but he  introduced the abuse into the very heart of the judicial body; the  tribunals were encumbered by newly-created magistrates.  The estates of  Languedoc complained in vain.  The Parliament of Paris was in its turn  attacked.  In 1521, three councillors, recently nominated, were convicted  of having paid, one three thousand eight hundred livres, and the two  others six thousand livres.  The Parliament refused to admit them.  Duprat protested.  The necessities of the state, he said, made borrowing  obligatory; and the king was free to prefer in his selections those of  his subjects who showed most zeal for his service.  Parliament persisted  in its refusal.  Duprat resolved to strike a great blow.  An edict of  January 31, 1522, created within the Parliament a fourth chamber,  composed of eighteen councillors and two presidents, all of fresh, and,  no doubt, venal appointment, though the edict dared not avow as much.  Two great personages, the Archbishop of Aix and Marshal de Montmorenci,  were charged to present the edict to Parliament and require its  registration.  The Parliament demanded time for deliberation.  It kept an  absolute silence for six weeks, and at last presented an address to the  queen-mother, trying to make her comprehend the harm such acts did to the  importance of the magistracy and to her son's government.  Louise  appeared touched by these representations, and promised to represent  their full weight to the king, \"if the Parliament will consent to point  out to me of itself any other means of readily raising the sum of one  hundred and twenty thousand livres, which the king absolutely cannot do  without.\"  The struggle was prolonged until the Parliament declared \"that  it could not, without offending God and betraying its own conscience,  proceed to the registration; but that if it were the king's pleasure to  be obeyed at any price, he had only to depute his chancellor or some  other great personage, in whose presence and on whose requirement the  registration should take place.\"  Chancellor Duprat did not care to  undertake this commission in person.  Count de St. Pol, governor of  Paris, was charged with it, and the court caused to be written at the  bottom of the letters of command, \"Read and published in presence of  Count de St. Pol, specially deputed for this purpose, who ordered viva  voce, in the king's name, that they be executed.\"    Thus began to be implanted in that which should be the most respected and  the most independent amongst the functions of government, namely, the  administration of justice, not only the practice, but the fundamental  maxim, of absolute government.  \"I am going to the court, and I will  speak the truth; after which the king will have to be obeyed,\" was said  in the middle of the seventeenth century by the premier president Mold to  Cardinal de Retz.  Chancellor Duprat, if we are not mistaken, was, in the  sixteenth century, the first chief of the French magistracy to make use  of language despotic not only in fact, but also in principle.  President  Mole was but the head of a body invested, so far as the king was  concerned, with the right of remonstrance and resistance; when once that  right was exercised, he might, without servility, give himself up to  resignation.  Chancellor Duprat was the delegate, the organ, the  representative of the king; it was in the name of the king himself that  he affirmed the absolute power of the kingship and the absolute duty of  submission.  Francis I. could not have committed the negotiation with Leo  X. in respect of Charles VII.'s Pragmatic Sanction to a man with more  inclination and better adapted for the work to be accomplished.    The Pragmatic Sanction had three principal objects:--         1.  To uphold the liberties and the influence of the faithful in the       government of the church, by sanctioning their right to elect       ministers of the Christian faith, especially parish priests and       bishops;         2.  To guarantee the liberties and rights of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#4)"],[1,"once from these meetings.  They met her in the  gallery, and asked her why she did not come any more to hear their  readings.  She answered very coldly, 'I am no longer admitted to those  mysteries.'  As they found a great deal of cleverness in her, they were  mortified and astonished at this.  Their astonishment was very much  greater, then, when the king, being obliged to keep his bed, sent for  them with orders to bring what they had newly written of history, and  they saw as they went in Madame de Maintenon sitting in an arm-chair near  the king's pillow, chatting familiarly with his Majesty.  They were just  going to begin their reading, when Madame do Montespan, who had not been  expected, came in, and after a few compliments to the king, paid such  long ones to Madame de Maintenon, that the king, to stop them, told her  to sit down.  'As it would not be fair,' he added, 'to read without you a  work which you yourself ordered.'  From this day, the two historians paid  their court to Madame de Maintenon as far as they knew how to do so.\"    The queen had died on the 30th of July, 1683, piously and gently, as she  had lived.  \"This is the first sorrow she ever caused me,\" said the king,  thus rendering homage in his superb and unconscious egotism, to the  patient virtue of the wife he had put to such cruel trials.  Madame de  Maintenon was agitated but resolute.  \"Madame de Montespan has plunged  into the deepest devoutness,\" she wrote, two months after the queen's  death; \"it is quite time she edified us; as for me, I no longer think of  retiring.\"  Her strong common sense and her far-sighted ambition, far  more than her virtue, had secured her against rocks ahead; henceforth she  saw the goal, she was close upon it, she moved towards it with an even  step.  The king still looked in upon Madame de Montespan of an evening  on his way to the gaming-table; he only staid an instant, to pass on to  Madame de Maintenon's; the latter had modestly refused to become lady in  attendance upon the dauphiness.  She, however, accompanied the king on  all his expeditions, \"sending him away always afflicted, but, never  disheartened.\"  Madame de Montespan, piqued to see that the king no  longer thought of anybody but Madame de Maintenon, \"said to him one day  at Marly,\" writes Dangeau, \"that she has a favor to ask of him, which was  to let her have the duty of entertaining the second-carriage people and  of amusing the antechamber.\"  It required more than seven years of wrath  and humiliation to make her resolve upon quitting the court, in 1691.    The date has never been ascertained exactly of the king's private  marriage with Madame de Maintenon.  It took place, probably, eighteen  months or two years after the queen's death; the king was forty-seven,  Madame de Maintenon fifty.    \"She had great remains of beauty, bright and sprightly eyes, an  imcomparable grace,\" says St. Simon, who detested her; \"an air of ease,  and yet of restraint and respect; a great deal of cleverness, with a  speech that was sweet, correct, in good terms, and naturally eloquent and  brief.\"    Madame do La Valliere had held sway over the young and passionate heart  of the prince, Madame de Montespan over the court, Madame de Maintenon  alone established her empire over the man and the king.  \"Whilst giving  up our heart, we must remain absolute master of our mind,\" Louis XIV.  had written, \"separate our affections from our resolves as a sovereign,  that she who enchants us may never have liberty to speak to us of our  business or of the people who serve us, and that they be two things  absolutely distinct.\"  The king had scrupulously applied this maxim;  Mdlle. de La Valliere had never given a thought to business; Madame de  Montespan had sought only to shine, disputing the influence of Colbert  when he would have put a limit upon her ruinous fancies, leaning for  support at the last upon Louvois, in order to counterbalance the growing  power of Madame de Maintenon; the latter alone had any part in affairs,  a smaller part than has frequently been made out, but important,  nevertheless, and sometimes decisive.  Ministers went occasionally to do  their work in her presence with the king, who would turn to her when the  questions were embarassing, and ask, \"What does your Solidity think?\"  The opinions she gave were generally moderate and discreet.  \"I did not  manage to please in my conversation about the buildings,\" she wrote to  Cardinal Noailles, \"and what grieves me is to have caused vexation to no  purpose.  Another block of chambers is being built here at a cost of a  hundred thousand francs; Marly will soon be a second Versailles.  The  people, what will become of them?\"  And later on: \"Would you think  proper, monsignor, to make out a list of good bishops?  You could send it  me, so that, on the occasions which are constantly occurring, I might  support their interests, and they might have the business referred to  them in which they ought to have a hand, and for which they are the  proper persons.  I am always spoken to when the question is of them; and  if I were better informed, I should be bolder.\"  \"It is said that you  meddle too little with business,\" Fenelon wrote to her in 1694; \"your  mind is better calculated for it than you suppose.  You ought to direct  your whole endeavors to giving the king views tending to peace, and  especially to the relief of the people, to moderation, to equity, to  mistrust of harsh and violent measures, to horror for acts of arbitrary  authority, and finally to love of the Church, and to assiduity in seeking  good pastors for it.\"  Neither Fenelon nor Madame de Maintenon had seen  in the revocation of the edict of Nantes \"an act of arbitrary authority,  or a harsh and violent measure.\"  She was not inclined towards  persecution, but she feared lest her moderation should be imputed to a  remnant of prejudice in favor of her former religion, \"and this it is,\"  she would say, \"which makes me approve of things quite opposed to my  sentiments.\"  An egotistical and cowardly prudence, which caused people  to attribute to Madame de Maintenon, in the severities against the  Huguenots, a share which she had not voluntarily or entirely assumed.    Whatever the apparent reserve and modesty with which it was cloaked, the  real power of Madame de Maintenon over the king's mind peeped out more  and more into broad daylight.  She promoted it dexterously by her extreme  anxiety to please him, as well as by her natural and sincere attachment  to the children whom she had brought up, and who had a place near the  heart of Louis XIV.  Already the young Duke of Maine had been sent to the  army at the dauphin's side; the king was about to have him married  [August 29, 1692] to Mdlle. de Charolais; carefully seeking for his  natural children alliances amongst the princes of his blood, he had  recently given Mdlle. de Nantes, daughter of Madame de Montespan, to the  duke, grandson of the great Conde.  \"For a long time past,\" says St.  Simon, \"Madame de Maintenon, even more than the king, had been thinking  of marrying Mdlle. de Blois, Madame de Montespan's second daughter, to  the Duke of Chartres; he was the king's own and only nephew, and the  first moves towards this marriage were the more difficult in that  Monsieur was immensely attached to all that appertained to his greatness,  and Madame was of a nation which abhorred misalliances, and of a  character which gave no promise of ever making this marriage agreeable to  her.\"  The king considered himself sure of his brother; he had set his  favorites to work, and employed underhand intrigues.  \"He sent for the  young Duke of Chartres, paid him attention, told him he wanted to have  him settled in life, that the war which was kindled on all sides put out  of his reach the princesses who might have suited him, that there were no  princesses of the blood of his own age, that he could not better testify  his affection towards him than by offering him his daughter whose two  sisters had married princes of the blood; but that, however eager he  might be for this marriage, he did not want to put any constraint upon  him, and would leave him full liberty in the matter.  This language,  addressed with the awful majesty so natural to the king to a prince who  was timid, and had not a word to say for himself, put him at his wits'  end.\"  He fell back upon the wishes of his father and mother.  \"That is  very proper in you,\" replied the king; \"but, as you consent, your father  and mother will make no objection;\" and, turning to Monsieur, who was  present, \"Is it not so, brother?\" he asked.  Monsieur had promised; a  messenger was sent for Madame, who cast two furious glances at her  husband and her son, saying that, as they were quite willing, she had  nothing to say, made a curt obeisance, and went her way home.  Thither  the court thronged next day; the marriage was announced.  \"Madame was  walking in the gallery with her favorite, Mdlle. de Chateau-Thiers,  taking long steps, handkerchief in hand, weeping unrestrainedly, speaking  somewhat loud,, gesticulating and making a good picture of Ceres after  the rape of her daughter Proserpine, seeking her in a frenzy, and  demanding her back from Jupiter.  Everybody saluted, and stood aside out  of respect.  Monsieur had taken refuge in lansquenet; never was anything  so shamefaced as his look or so disconcerted as his whole appearance, and  this first condition lasted more than a month with him.  The Duke of  Chartres came into the gallery, going up to his mother, as he did every  day, to kiss her hand.  At that moment, Madame gave him a box of the ear  so loud that it was heard some paces off, and given as it was before the  whole court, covered the poor prince with confusion, and overwhelmed the  countless spectators with prodigious astonishment.\"  That did not prevent  or hamper the marriage, which took place with great pomp "]]]
