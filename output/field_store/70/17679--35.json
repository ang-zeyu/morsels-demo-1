And when the hills are full,  And newer fashions blow,  Doth not retract a single spice  For pang of jealousy.    Her public is the noon,  Her providence the sun,  Her progress by the bee proclaimed  In sovereign, swerveless tune.    The bravest of the host,  Surrendering the last,  Nor even of defeat aware  When cancelled by the frost.            XV.    THE BEE.    Like trains of cars on tracks of plush  I hear the level bee:  A jar across the flowers goes,  Their velvet masonry    Withstands until the sweet assault  Their chivalry consumes,  While he, victorious, tilts away  To vanquish other blooms.    His feet are shod with gauze,  His helmet is of gold;  His breast, a single onyx  With chrysoprase, inlaid.    His labor is a chant,  His idleness a tune;  Oh, for a bee's experience  Of clovers and of noon!            XVI.    Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn  Indicative that suns go down;  The notice to the startled grass  That darkness is about to pass.            XVII.    As children bid the guest good-night,  And then reluctant turn,  My flowers raise their pretty lips,  Then put their nightgowns on.    As children caper when they wake,  Merry that it is morn,  My flowers from a hundred cribs  Will peep, and prance again.            XVIII.    Angels in the early morning  May be seen the dews among,  Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:  Do the buds to them belong?    Angels when the sun is hottest  May be seen the sands among,  Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;  Parched the flowers they bear along.            XIX.    So bashful when I spied her,  So pretty, so ashamed!  So hidden in her leaflets,  Lest anybody find;    So breathless till I passed her,  So helpless when I turned  And bore her, struggling, blushing,  Her simple haunts beyond!    For whom I robbed the dingle,  For whom betrayed the dell,  Many will doubtless ask me,  But I shall never tell!            XX.    TWO WORLDS.    It makes no difference abroad,  The seasons fit the same,  The mornings blossom into noons,  And split their pods of flame.    Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,  The brooks brag all the day;  No blackbird bates his jargoning  For passing Calvary.    Auto-da-fe and judgment  Are nothing to the bee;  His separation from his rose  To him seems misery.            XXI.    THE MOUNTAIN.    The mountain sat upon the plain  In his eternal chair,  His observation omnifold,  His inquest everywhere.    The seasons prayed around his knees,  Like children round a sire:  Grandfather of the days is he,  Of dawn the ancestor.            XXII.    A DAY.    I'll tell you how the sun rose, --  A ribbon at a time.  The steeples swam in amethyst,  The news like squirrels ran.    The hills untied their bonnets,  The bobolinks begun.  Then I said softly to myself,  \"That must have been the sun!\"            *  *  *    But how he set, I know not.  There seemed a purple stile  Which little yellow boys and girls  Were climbing all the while    Till when they reached the other side,  A dominie in gray  Put gently up the evening bars,  And led the flock away.            XXIII.    The butterfly's assumption-gown,  In chrysoprase apartments hung,    This afternoon put on.    How condescending to descend,  And be of buttercups the friend    In a New England town!            XXIV.    THE WIND.    Of all the sounds despatched abroad,  There's not a charge to me  Like that old measure in the boughs,  That phraseless melody    The wind does, working like a hand  Whose fingers brush the sky,  Then quiver down, with tufts of tune  Permitted gods and me.    When winds go round and round in bands,  And thrum upon the door,  And birds take places overhead,  To bear them orchestra,    I crave him grace, of summer boughs,  If such an outcast be,  He never heard that fleshless chant  Rise solemn in the tree,    As if some caravan of sound  On deserts, in the sky,  Had broken rank,  Then knit, and passed  In seamless company.            XXV.    DEATH AND LIFE.    Apparently with no surprise  To any happy flower,  The frost beheads it at its play  In accidental power.  The blond assassin passes on,  The sun proceeds unmoved  To measure off another day  For an approving God.            XXVI.    'T WAS later when the summer went  Than when the cricket came,  And yet we knew that gentle clock  Meant nought but going home.    'T was sooner when the cricket went  Than when the winter came,  Yet that pathetic pendulum  Keeps esoteric time.            XXVII.    INDIAN SUMMER.    These are the days when birds come back,  A very few, a bird or two,  To take a backward look.    These are the days when skies put on  The old, old sophistries of June, --  A blue and gold mistake.    Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,  Almost thy plausibility  Induces my belief,    Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,  And softly through the altered air  Hurries a timid leaf!    Oh, sacrament of summer days,  Oh, last communion in the haze,  Permit a child to join,    Thy sacred emblems to partake,  Thy consecrated bread to break,  Taste thine immortal wine!            XXVIII.    AUTUMN.    The morns are meeker than they were,  The nuts are getting brown;  The berry's cheek is plumper,  The rose is out of town.    The maple wears a gayer scarf,  The field a scarlet gown.  Lest I should be old-fashioned,  I'll put a trinket on.            XXIX.    BECLOUDED.    The sky is low, the clouds are mean,  A travelling flake of snow  Across a barn or through a rut  Debates if it will go.    A narrow wind complains all day  How some one treated him;  Nature, like us, is sometimes caught  Without her diadem.            XXX.    THE HEMLOCK.    I think the hemlock likes to stand  Upon a marge of snow;  It suits his own austerity,  And satisfies an awe    That men must slake in wilderness,  Or in the desert cloy, --  An instinct for the hoar, the bald,  Lapland's necessity.    The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;  The gnash of northern winds  Is sweetest nutriment to him,  His best Norwegian wines.    To satin races he is nought;  But children on the Don  Beneath his tabernacles play,  And Dnieper wrestlers run.            XXXI.    There's a certain slant of light,  On winter afternoons,  That oppresses, like the weight  Of cathedral tunes.    Heavenly hurt it gives us;  We can find no scar,  But internal difference  Where the meanings are.    None may teach it anything,  'T is the seal, despair, --  An imperial affliction  Sent us of the air.    When it comes, the landscape listens,  Shadows hold their breath;  When it goes, 't is like the distance  On the look of death.              IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.    I.    One dignity delays for all,  One mitred afternoon.  None can avoid this purple,  None evade this crown.    Coach it insures, and footmen,  Chamber and state and throng;  Bells, also, in the village,  As we ride grand along.    What dignified attendants,  What service when we pause!  How loyally at parting  Their hundred hats they raise!    How pomp surpassing ermine,  When simple you and I  Present our meek escutcheon,  And claim the rank to die!            II.    TOO LATE.    Delayed till she had ceased to know,  Delayed till in its vest of snow     Her loving bosom lay.  An hour behind the fleeting breath,  Later by just an hour than death, --     Oh, lagging yesterday!    Could she have guessed that it would be;  Could but a crier of the glee     Have climbed the distant hill;  Had not the bliss so slow a pace, --  Who knows but this surrendered face     Were undefeated still?    Oh, if there may departing be  Any forgot by victory     In her imperial round,  Show them this meek apparelled thing,  That could not stop to be a king,     Doubtful if it be crowned!            III.    ASTRA CASTRA.    Departed to the judgment,  A mighty afternoon;  Great clouds like ushers leaning,  Creation looking on.    The flesh surrendered, cancelled,  The bodiless begun;  Two worlds, like audiences, disperse  And leave the soul alone.            IV.    Safe in their alabaster chambers,  Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,  Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,  Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.    Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;  Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;  Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, --  Ah, what sagacity perished here!    Grand go the years in the crescent above them;  Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,  Diadems drop and Doges surrender,  Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.            V.    On this long storm the rainbow rose,  On this late morn the sun;  The clouds, like listless elephants,  Horizons straggled down.    The birds rose smiling in their nests,  The gales indeed were done;  Alas! how heedless were the eyes  On whom the summer shone!    The quiet nonchalance of death  No daybreak can bestir;  The slow archangel's syllables  Must awaken her.            VI.    FROM THE CHRYSALIS.    My cocoon tightens, colors tease,  I'm feeling for the air;  A dim capacity for wings  Degrades the dress I wear.    A power of butterfly must be  The aptitude to fly,  Meadows of majesty concedes  And easy sweeps of sky.    So I must baffle at the hint  And cipher at the sign,  And make much blunder, if at last  I take the clew divine.            VII.    SETTING SAIL.    Exultation is the going  Of an inland soul to sea, --  Past the houses, past the headlands,  Into deep eternity!    Bred as we, among the mountains,  Can the sailor understand  The divine intoxication  Of the first league out from land?            VIII.    Look back on time with kindly eyes,  He doubtless did his best;  How softly sinks his trembling sun  In human nature's west!            IX.    A train went through a burial gate,  A bird broke forth and"]]]
