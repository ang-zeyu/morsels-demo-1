'Tis true they  are well fed; the interest of their owners secures that. They are  over-well fed, in order that a supernatural energy may be exerted. The  morrow comes when their galled withers are again to be wrung by the  ill-cushioned collars, and the lumbering of the wheels. But we do not  witness all the misery of the noble and the generous steed. When  the shades of night impend, the reproaches of the feeling, or the  expostulations of the timid traveller no longer protect him from the  lash; and the dread of Mr. Martin's act ceases to effect for a  time its beneficent purpose; when the stiffened joints--the cracked  hoofs--the greasy legs--and stumbling gait of the worn-out animal are  all put into agonized motion by belabouring _him upon the raw_!  The expression is Hibernian, but the brutality is our own. A few  ill-gained pounds reconcile the enormity to the owner--and the  cheapness and expedition of the conveyance give it public sanction:  but humanity is outraged by the same: human sympathies are seared; and  the noble precept, that \"the merciful man is merciful to his beast,\"  is trampled under foot.    Thus then, by substituting elementary for physical power, we have  comfort for comparative inconvenience--the inside of an elegant  apartment, where books, amusement, or general conversation may  occupy agreeably the time--for the outside of a hard, unsafe stage  conveyance, and exposure to all changes or varieties of atmosphere.  Nay, we see no reason to prevent such improvement in steam-carriages  as shall fit them up like steam-boats, the campaigning carriage of  Napoleon, or the travelling long coach of the present Duke of  Orleans, with beds, and a furnished table. We have besides safety  for danger--accelerated speed without inhumanity--gain of time--of  accommodation--of money--and over and above all, as a non-consumer  of food, we have by the substitution what will remove the host of  Malthusian ills to a period of almost indefinite duration.           *       *       *       *       *        OLD POETS.           *       *       *       *       *    EYES AND TEARS.        How wisely Nature did decree    With the same eyes to weep and see!    That, having view'd the object vain,    They might be ready to complain.    And, since the self-deluding sight,    In a false angle takes each height,    These tears which better measure all.    Like wat'ry lines and plummets fall.    Two tears, with sorrow long did weigh,    Within the scales of either eye,    And then paid out in equal poise,    Are the true price of all my joys.    What in the world most fair appears,    Yea, even laughter, turns to tears:    And all the jewels which we prize,    Melt in these pendents of the eyes.    I have through every garden been,    Amongst the red, the white, the green;    And yet from all those flow'rs I saw,    No honey, but these tears could draw.    So the all-seeing sun each day,    Distils the world with chemic ray;    But finds the essence only showers,    Which straight in pity back he pours.    Yet happy they whom grief doth bless,    That weep the more, and see the less;    And, to preserve their sight more true,    Bathe still their eyes in their own dew.    So Magdalen, in tears more wise    Dissolv'd those captivating eyes,    Whose liquid chains could flowing meet,    To fetter her Redeemer's feet.    Not full sails hasting loaden home,    Nor the chaste lady's pregnant womb,    Nor Cynthia teeming shows so fair,    As two eyes, swoln with weeping, are    The sparkling glance that shoots desire,    Drench'd in these waves, does lose its fire.    Yea, oft the Thunderer pity takes,    And here the hissing lightning slakes.    The incense was to heaven dear,    Not as a perfume, but a tear!    And stars show lovely in the night,    But as they seem the tears of light.    Ope, then, mine eyes, your double sluice,    And practise so your noblest use;    For others too can see, or sleep,    But only human eyes can weep.    Now, like two clouds dissolving, drop,    And at each tear in distance stop:    Now, like two fountains, trickle down:    Now like two floods o'er-run and drown:    Thus lot your streams o'erflow your springs,    Till eyes and tears be the same things;    And each the other's difference bears;    These weeping eyes, those seeing tears.    MARVELL.        (_From a neatly-printed Life of the Poet, by John Dove._)           *       *       *       *       *      A DROP OF DEW.        See, how the orient dew      Shed from the bosom of the morn,        Into the blowing roses,    Yet careless of its mansion new,      For the clear region where 'twas born        Round in itself incloses:    And in its little globe's extent,    Frames, as it can, its native element.        How it the purple flow'r does slight,      Scarce touching where it lies;      But gazing back upon the skies,        Shines with a mournful light,    Like its own tear,    Because so long divided from the sphere.      Restless it rolls, and unsecure,      Trembling, lest it grows impure;      Till the warm sun pities its pain,      And to the skies exhales it back again.      So the _soul_, that drop, that ray,      Of the clear fountain of eternal day,    Could it within the human flow'r be seen,      Rememb'ring still its former height,    Shuns the sweet leaves, and blossoms green;      And, recollecting its own light,    Does, in its pure and circling thoughts, express    The greater heaven in an heaven less,      In how coy a figure wound,        Every way it turns away:      So the world excluding round,        Yet receiving in the day.    Dark beneath, but bright above;    Here disdaining, there in love,      How loose and easy hence to go;        How girt and ready to ascend:      Moving but on a point below,        It all about does upward bend.    Such did the Manna's sacred dew distil,    White and entire, although congeal'd and chill;    Congeal'd on earth; but does, dissolving run    Into the glories of th' almighty sun.    IBID.           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *    ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, REGENT'S PARK.      We recommend such of our London friends and visiters from the country  as have not lately passed an hour or two in the Zoological Gardens,  to do so without further delay. The present season is warm and genial,  and the rejoicing rays of the morning and noontide sun enliven the  tenants of this mimic world in a garden. As evening approaches the air  becomes chill and misty, though      The weary sun hath made a golden set,    And, by the bright track of his fiery ear,    Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow:    the several animals indicate their sense of the atmospheric changes by  their decreased activity, reminding us of the comparative torpidity in  which the majority of them will pass the coming winter.    The present Cuts represent a few of the recent improvements in  the Zoological Gardens, as, the addition of the clock-house and  weathercock[5] to the Llama House.        [5] By the way, a natural weathercock instead of the gilded      vane, as defined by Brown, would have been a _rara avis_: \"A      kingfisher hanged by the bill, converting the breast to that      point of the horizon whence the wind doth blow, is a very      strange introducing of natural weathercocks.\"    [Illustration: (_Llama House._)]    Opposite is the sloping gravel walk leading from the Terrace; and  a large cage for Parrots, Parrakeets, Macaws, and Cockatoos, whose  brilliant colours are here seen to advantage in the resplendent beams  of a September sun. In the distance are the Bear Pole and Shed for  Goats.    [Illustration: (_Armadillos._)]    The next Cut includes the House and Enclosure for Armadillos, who  are, in sunny weather, located here with a \"select few\" rabbits. The  innocent gambols and restless run of the Armadillo over the turf are  here seen to advantage. This house as the distance of the Cut shows,  is not far from the Llama House and circular Aviary.    Thus far in the Southern Garden, whence we reach the Northern by the  Tunnel beneath the Park-road, as figured in _The Mirror_, No. 535,  opposite to the end of the tunnel is a large squirrel-cage, and at the  extremity of the walk to the right is a spacious building, called the  Repository \"the inhabitants of which are continually being changed as  variations in the weather, or any other cause may render convenient.\"  We last saw there the noble Lions from the Tower, together with the  Hyaena, Jackal, Ichneumons, Coatimondis, besides an assemblage of  splendid tropical birds. The exterior of the building, especially the  ornamented gable and doorways, is picturesque.    [Illustration: (_The Repository._)]    [Illustration: (_Deer._)]    [Illustration: (_Elephants._)]    Repassing the Squirrel Cage, the visiter must next proceed along the  straight gravelled walk, which leads towards the western extremity  of the North Garden. Here is a range of buildings, among which is the  Stable and enclosed Yard for Deer; Among which are specimens of the  Wapiti, remarkable for its size and the amplitude of its branching  horns when full grown. Next is the Stable and Enclosure for Elephants,  opposite the capacious Bath already represented in _The Mirror_, No.  560.    In a fortnight we may probably resume our graphic visit to this most  interesting resort.           *       *       *       *       *      THE VOICE OF HUMANITY.      \"The Association for promoting Rational Humanity towards the Animal  Creation\" exists--though, in one sense, as a blot upon the character  of the age.

The  thirty-three gods[8] with Upendra (Vishnu) and Mahendra, and the order  of Vaimanikas[9] have attained success by worshipping thee. By offering  thee garlands of the celestial _Mandaras_[10] the best of the  _Vidyadharas_ have obtained all their desires. The _Guhyas_ and the  seven orders of the _Pitris_--both divine and human--have attained  superiority by adoring thee alone. The _Vasus_, the _Manilas_, and the  _Rudras_, the _Sadhyas_, the _Marichipas_, the _Valikhilyas_, and the  _Siddhas_, have attained pre-eminence by bowing down unto thee. There is  nothing that I know in the entire seven worlds, including that of Brahma  which is beyond thee. There are other beings both great and endued with  energy; but none of them hath thy lustre and energy. All light is in  thee, indeed, thou art the lord of all light. In thee are the (five)  elements and all intelligence, and knowledge and asceticism and the  ascetic properties.[11] The discus by which the wielder of the  _Saranga_[12] humbleth the pride of Asuras and which is furnished with a  beautiful nave, was forged by Viswakarman with thy energy. In summer  thou drawest, by thy rays, moisture from all corporeal existences and  plants and liquid substances, and pourest it down in the rainy season.  Thy rays warm and scorch, and becoming as clouds roar and flash with  lightning and pour down showers when the season cometh. Neither fire nor  shelter, nor woolen cloths give greater comfort to one suffering from  chilling blasts than thy rays. Thou illuminest by thy rays the whole  Earth with her thirteen islands. Thou alone are engaged in the welfare  of the three worlds. If thou dost not rise, the universe becometh blind  and the learned cannot employ themselves in the attainment of virtue,  wealth and profit. It is through thy grace that the (three) orders of  Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas are able to perform their various  duties and sacrifices.[13] Those versed in chronology say that thou art  the beginning and thou the end of a day of Brahma, which consisteth of a  full thousand _Yugas_. Thou art the lord of Manus and of the sons of the  Manus, of the universe and of man, of the _Manwantaras_, and their  lords. When the time of universal dissolution cometh, the fire  _Samvartaka_ born of thy wrath consumeth the three worlds and existeth  alone. And clouds of various hues begotten of thy rays, accompanied by  the elephant Airavata and the thunderbolt, bring about the appointed  deluges. And dividing thyself into twelve parts and becoming as many  suns, thou drinkest up the ocean once more with thy rays. Thou art  called Indra, thou art Vishnu, thou art Brahma, thou art Prajapati. Thou  art fire and thou art the subtle mind. And thou art lord and the eternal  _Brahma_. Thou art _Hansa_, thou art _Savitri_, thou art _Bhanu_,  _Ansumalin_, and _Vrishakapi_. Thou art _Vivaswan, Mihira, Pusha, Mitra_,  and _Dharma_. Thou art thousand-rayed, thou art _Aditya_, and _Tapana_,  and the lord of rays. Thou art _Martanda_, and _Arka_, and _Ravi_, and  _Surya_ and _Saranya_ and maker of day, and _Divakara_ and  _Suptasaspti_, and _Dhumakeshin_ and _Virochana_. Thou art spoken of as  swift of speed and the destroyer of darkness, and the possessor of  yellow steeds. He that reverentially adoreth thee on the sixth or the  seventh lunar day with humility and tranquillity of mind, obtaineth the  grace of Lakshmi. They that with undivided attention adore and worship  thee, are delivered from all dangers, agonies, and afflictions. And they  that hold that thou art everywhere (being the soul of all things) living  long, freed from sin and enjoying an immunity from all diseases. O lord  of all food, it behoveth thee to grant food in abundance unto me who am  desirous of food even for entertaining all my guests with reverence. I  bow also to all those followers of thine that have taken refuge at thy  feet--_Mathara_ and _Aruna_ and _Danda_ and others, including _Asani_  and _Kshuva_ and the others. And I bow also to the celestial mothers of  all creatures, _viz_., Kshuva and _Maitri_ and the others of the class.

These      airs are five: _Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana_, and _Vyana_.        [8] The 8 _Vasus_, the 11 _Rudras_, the 12 _Adityas_,     _Prajapati_, and _Vashatkara_.

Vaisampayana said, \"Thus, O great king, was the sun that purifier of the  world, adored (by Yudhishthira). And pleased with the hymn, the maker of  day, self-luminous, and blazing like fire showed himself to the son of  Pandu. And Vivaswan said, 'Thou shall obtain all that thou desirest. I  shall provide thee with food for five and seven years together. And, O  king, accept this copper-vessel which I give unto thee. And, O thou of  excellent vows, as long as Panchali will hold this vessel, without  partaking of its contents fruits and roots and meat and vegetables  cooked in thy kitchen, these four kinds of food shall from this day be  inexhaustible. And, on the fourteenth year from this, thou shall regain  thy kingdom.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, the god vanished away. He  that, with the desire of obtaining a boon, reciteth this hymn  concentrating his mind with ascetic abstraction, obtaineth it from the  sun, however difficult of acquisition it may be that he asketh for. And  the person, male or female, that reciteth or heareth this hymn day after  day, if he or she desireth for a son, obtaineth one, and if riches,  obtaineth them, and if learning acquireth that too. And the person male  or female, that reciteth this hymn every day in the two twilights, if  overtaken by danger, is delivered from it, and if bound, is freed from  the bonds. Brahma himself had communicated this hymn to the illustrious  Sakra, and from Sakra was it obtained by Narada and from Narada, by  Dhaumya. And Yudhishthira, obtaining it from Dhaumya, attained all his  wishes. And it is by virtue of this hymn that one may always obtain  victory in war, and acquire immense wealth also. And it leadeth the  reciter from all sins, to the solar region.\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having obtained the boon, the virtuous son of  Kunti, rising from the water, took hold of Dhaumya's feet and then  embraced his brother's. And, O exalted one, wending then with Draupadi  to the kitchen, and adored by her duly, the son of Pandu set himself to  cook (their day's) food. And the clean food, however little, that was  dressed, furnished with the four tastes, increased and became  inexhaustible. And with it Yudhishthira began to feed the regenerate  ones. And after the Brahmanas had been fed, and his younger brothers  also, Yudhishthira himself ate of the food that remained, and which is  called _Vighasa_. And after Yudhishthira had eaten, the daughter of  Prishata took what remained. And after she had taken her meal, the day's  food became exhausted.    \"And having thus obtained the boon from the maker of day, the son of  Pandu, himself as resplendent as that celestial, began to entertain the  Brahmanas agreeably to their wishes. And obedient to their priest, the  sons of Pritha, on auspicious lunar days and constellations and  conjunctions, performed sacrifices according to the ordinance, the  scriptures, and the _Mantras_. After the sacrifices, the sons of Pandu,  blessed by the auspicious rites performed by Dhaumya and accompanied by  him, and surrounded also by the Brahmanas set out for the woods of  _Kamyaka_.\"      SECTION IV    Vaisampayana said,--\"After the Pandavas had gone to the forest,  Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika, whose knowledge was his eye,[14] became  exceedingly sorrowful. And seated at his ease the king addressed these  words to the virtuous Vidura of profound intelligence, 'Thy  understanding is as clear as that of Bhargava.[15] Thou knowest also all  the subtleties of morality, and thou lookest on all the Kauravas with an  equal eye. O, tell me what is proper for me and them. O Vidura, things  having thus taken their course, what should we do now? How may I secure  the goodwill of the citizens so that they may not destroy us to the  roots? O, tell us all, since thou art conversant with every excellent  expedient.'        [14] Dhritarashtra being blind is described as _Pragnachakshu,      i.e._ having knowledge for his eye. It may also mean. \"Of the      prophetic eye.\"        [15] The great preceptor of the Asuras, _viz., Sukra_,      possessing the highest intelligence as evidenced by his various      works on all manner of subjects particularly, the _Sukra-niti_.    \"Vidura said, 'The three-fold purposes, O king (_viz_., profit,  pleasure, and salvation), have their foundations in virtue, and the  sages say that a kingdom also standeth on virtue as its basis.  Therefore, O monarch, according to the best of thy power, cherish thou  virtuously thy own sons and those of Pandu. That virtue had been  beguiled by wicked souls with Suvala's son at their head, when thy sons  invited the righteous Yudhishthira and defeated him in the match at  dice. O king, of this deed of utter iniquity I behold this expiation  whereby, O chief of the Kurus, thy son, freed from sin, may win back his  position among good men. Let the sons of Pandu, obtain that which was  given unto them by thee. For, verily, even this is the highest morality  that a king should remain content with his own, and never covet  another's possessions. Thy good name then would not suffer nor would  family"]]]
