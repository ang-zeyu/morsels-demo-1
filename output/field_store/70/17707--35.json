The common and  characteristic mark of their superstition, is the system of Fetiches,  by which an individual appropriates to himself some casual object as  divine, and which, with respect to himself, by this process, becomes  deified, and exercises a peculiar fatality over his fortune. The  barbarism of Africa, may be attributed in part its great fertility,  which enables its inhabitants to live without are but chiefly to its  imperviousness to strangers. Every petty state is so surrounded with  natural barriers, that it is isolated from the rest, and though it  may be overrun and wasted, and part of its inhabitants carried into  captivity, it has never been made to form a constituent part of one  large consolidated empire and thus smaller states become dependent,  without being incorporated. The whole region is still more  inaccessible on a grand scale, than the petty states are in  miniature; and while the rest of the earth has become common, from  the frequency of visitors, Africa still retains part of the mystery,  which hung over the primitive and untrodden world.    Passing over the attempts of the very early travellers to become  acquainted with the geographical portion of Africa, in which much  fiction, and little truth, were blended, we arrive at that period,  when the spirit of discovery began to manifest itself amongst some of  the European states. The darkness and lethargy, which characterised  the middle ages, had cast their baneful influence over every project,  which had discovery for its aim, and even the invaluable discovery of  the mariner's compass, which took place at the commencement of the  thirteenth century, and which opened to man the dominion of the sea,  and put him in full possession of the earth had little immediate  effect in emboldening navigators to venture into unfrequented seas.  At a somewhat earlier period, it is true, the Hanse Towns and the  Italian republics began to cultivate manufactures and commerce, and  to lay the foundation of a still higher prosperity, but they carried  on chiefly an inland or coasting trade. The naval efforts, even of  Venice or Genoa, had no further aim than to bring from Alexandria,  and the shores of the Black Sea, the commodities of India, which had  been conveyed thither chiefly by caravans over land. Satisfied with  the wealth and power, to which they had been raised by this local and  limited commerce, these celebrated republics made an attempt to open  a more extended path over the ocean. Their pilots, indeed, guided  most of the vessels engaged in the early voyages of discovery, but  they were employed, and the means furnished, by the great monarchs,  whose ports were situated upon the shores of the Atlantic.    The first appearance of a bolder spirit, in which the human mind  began to  make a grand movement in every direction, in religion,  science, freedom, and liberty, may be dated from about the end of the  fifteenth century. The glory of leading the way in this new career,  was reserved for Portugal, then one  of the smallest, and least  powerful of the European kingdoms.    When in 1412, John I. sent forth a few vessels, to explore the  western shores of Africa, while he prepared a great armament to  attack the moors of Barbary, the art of navigation was still very  imperfect, nor had the Portuguese ever ventured to sail beyond Cape  Non. But what most powerfully contributed to give impulse and  direction to the national ardour, was the enlightened enthusiasm,  with which prince Henry of Portugal, a younger son of John I.,  espoused the interests of science, and the prosecution of nautical  discovery. In order to pursue his splendid projects without  interruption, he fixed his residence at Sagres, near Cape St.  Vincent, where the prospect of the open Atlantic continually invited  his thoughts to their favourite theme. His first effort was upon a  small scale. He fitted out a single ship, the command of which was  entrusted to two gentlemen of his household, who volunteered their  services, with instructions to use their utmost endeavours to double  Cape Bojador, and thence to steer southward. According to the mode of  navigation, which then prevailed, they held their course along the  shore, and by following that direction, they must have encountered  almost insuperable difficulties, in the attempt to pass the cape;  their want of skill was, however, compensated by a fortunate  accident. A sudden squall drove them out to sea, and when they  expected every moment to perish, landed them on an unknown island,  which, from their happy escape, they named Porto Santo. They returned  to Portugal with the good tidings, and were received with the  applause due to fortunate adventurers. The following year, prince  Henry sent out three ships to take possession of the new island; a  fixed spot on the horizon, towards the south, resembling a small  black cloud, soon attracted the attention of the settlers, and the  conjecture suggested itself that it might be land. Steering towards  it, they arrived at a considerable island, uninhabited, and covered  with wood, which, on that account, they called Madeira.    By these voyages, the Portuguese became accustomed to a bolder  navigation, and at length, in 1433, Gilianez, one of prince Henry's  captains, by venturing out into the open sea, succeeded in doubling  Cape Bojador, which, until then, had been regarded as impassable.  This successful voyage, which the ignorance of the age placed on a  level with the most famous exploits recorded in history, opened a new  sphere to navigation, as it discovered the vast continent of Africa,  still washed by the Atlantic Ocean, and stretching towards the south.  A rapid progress was then made along the shores of the Sehara, and  the Portuguese navigators were not long in reaching the fertile  regions watered by the Senegal and the Gambia.    The early part of this progress was dreary in the extreme; they saw  nothing before them but a wild expanse of lifeless earth and sky,  naked rocks and burning sands, stretching immeasurably into the  exterior, and affording no encouragement to any project of  settlement. After, however, passing Cape Blanco, the coast began to  improve in appearance, and when they saw the ivory and gold brought  down from the interior, those regions began to excite the lust of  conquest. This was, however, an undertaking beyond the means of any  force which had as yet sailed from Portugal. In 1443, however, Nuno  Tristan discovered the island of Arguin, and as Gonzalo da Centra was  in 1445 killed by a party of negroes, in attempting to ascend a small  river, near the Rio Grande, the Portuguese considered an insular  position to be the most eligible for a settlement, and the island of  Arguin was accordingly fixed upon.    This establishment had been scarcely formed, when an important event  took place, which afforded a favourable opportunity and pretext for  laying the foundation of the Portuguese empire in Africa. Bemoy, a  prince of the Jaloofs, arrived at Arguin, as a suppliant for foreign  aid, in recovering his dominions from a more powerful competitor or  usurper. He was received with open arms, and conveyed to Lisbon,  where he experienced a brilliant reception, his visit being  celebrated by all the festal exhibitions peculiar to that age,  bull-fights, puppet-shows, and even feats of dogs. On that occasion,  Bemoy made a display of the agility of his native attendants, who on  foot, kept pace with the swift horses, mounting and alighting from  these animals at full gallop After being instructed in the Christian  religion, he was baptized, and did homage to the king and the pope,  for the crown, which was to be placed on his head; for this purpose a  powerful armament under the command of Pero vaz d'Acunha, was sent  out with him, to the banks of the Senegal.    The circumstance, which tended more particularly to inflame the pious  zeal of the Christian monarch, was the information, that to the east  of Timbuctoo there was a territory inhabited by a people who were  neither moors nor pagans, but who, in many of their customs resembled  the Christians. It was immediately inferred, that this could be no  other than the kingdom of the mysterious personage known in Europe,  under the uncouth appellation of Prester John. This singular name  seems first to have been introduced by travellers from eastern Asia,  where it had been applied to some Nestorian bishop, who held there a  species of sovereignty, and when rumours arrived of the Christian  king of Abyssinia, he was concluded to be the real Prester John.  His dominions  being reported to stretch far inland, and the breadth  of the African continent being very imperfectly understood, the  conclusion was formed, that a mission from the western coast might  easily reach his capital. It does not fully appear, what were the  precise expectations from an intercourse with this great personage,  but it seems to have been thoroughly rooted in the minds of the  Portuguese, that they would be raised to a matchless height of glory  and felicity, if they could by any means arrive at his court. The  principal instruction given to all officers employed in the African  service, was, that in every quarter, and by every means, they should  endeavour to effect this discovery. They accordingly never failed to  put the question to all the wanderers of the desert, and to every  caravan that came from the interior, but in vain, the name had never  been heard. The Portuguese then besought the natives at all events,  into whatever region they might travel, studiously to inquire if  Prester John was there, or if any one knew where he was to be found,  and on the promise of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#4)"],[1,"the Hawkesbury, for various articles wanted at  Sydney. From that part of the settlement, the timber most useful for boat  and other buildings was occasionally received; shingles also of a good  sort were brought round; and frequently the boats returned loaded with  grain. It has been shown, in the account of this colony already  published, that the farms upon the fertile banks of that river were  superior, in point of soil, to any near the principal settlement; and  that, had they been in the hands of good and industrious characters, they  would have produced abundant crops, and enriched their owners. But every  day's experience evinced, that the people thus fortunately situated were,  unluckily, some of the most profligate wretches in the colony; and their  distance from the immediate seat of government added much to the  inconvenience. Such of these farms as were situated on the low grounds  were often overflowed after very heavy falls of rain; but this  circumstance was in no way injurious to the farmer, unless it happened  when the grain was ripening.    Among other local arrangements which took place, and were extremely  useful, must be reckoned the numbering of the houses of the towns of  Sydney and Parramatta, and dividing them into portions; with a principal  inhabitant at the head of each division, who was charged with the peace  and good order of the district in which he lived.    The frame of the Log Prison at Sydney was got up in the course of this  month, to the great annoyance of the worthless, who seemed to anticipate  the lodging in it which they merited.    At Parramatta and Toongabbie a very few old stacks of wheat belonging to  government were opened for the purpose of being thrashed out, when they  were found to have been much injured by vermin.    In the course of this month, Bennillong, who had returned to all the  habits of savage life, claimed the protection of the governor from the  menaces of several of his countrymen, who, he with much agitation  informed him, had assembled in a considerable body near the Brickfields*,  to lie in wait for him; and where, if possible, they intended to kill  him; he having, as they suspected, killed a man near Botany Bay. This he  positively denied having done, and the governor dispatched him to the  place, guarded by some of the military, where he explained to his  countrymen that he had not killed the man in question, or any man; and  that the soldiers were sent with him, to convince them that the governor  would not suffer him, his old friend and fellow voyager (it must be  remembered that Bennillong returned from England with the governor in His  Majesty's ship _Reliance_), to be ill treated by them on any false  pretence; and that he was determined to drive every native away from  Sydney who should attempt it. This threat had a good effect. Many of them  were much alarmed when they saw in what manner and by whom Bennillong was  attended; and to be driven from a place whence they derived so many  comforts, and so much shelter in bad weather, would have been severely  felt by most of them.    [* Adjacent to the town of Sydney.]    In the first part of the month the weather was not very good; about the  middle some showers fell very seasonably for the harvest; and towards the  latter part the regular land and sea breezes had set in, which kept the  weather cool and pleasant.    November.] The month of November opened with the arrival of the _Prince  of Wales_, victualler, from England. She had been close in with Botany  Bay the preceding day; but, there being little wind, the master had been  obliged to stretch out from the land during the night; and the next  morning, a pilot getting on board, she was brought in. She had sailed in  company with the _Sylph_, which also had provisions for the  settlement on board, but which did not arrive until the 17th. They  brought the information, that a Dutch fleet, consisting of ten sail of  ships of war, bound to the East Indies had been captured off the Cape of  Good Hope, by His Majesty's fleet, under Admiral Sir Geo. Keith  Elphinstone (now Lord Keith), which had followed them from England.    The useful regulation of numbering the different houses in the town of  Sydney, particularly those in the occupation of the convicts, was  followed up by another equally serviceable, which directed the  inhabitants of each of the four divisions of the town (for into that  number it was portioned off) to meet, and from among themselves elect  three of the most decent and respectable characters, who were to be  approved by the governor, and were to serve for the ensuing year as  watchmen, for the purpose of enforcing a proper attention to the good  order and tranquillity of their respective divisions. Many of the  soldiers being allowed to occupy houses for their families in the  vicinity of the barracks, the commanding officer was desired to appoint  his own watchmen for the military division of the town, and to order them  to report to him.    A few days previous to the arrival of the _Sylph_, the Colonial  schooner returned from Norfolk Island, and brought letters from the  _Reliance_, _Supply_, and _Britannia_, which ships left that  island on the 25th of the last month, and the day following her  arrival (the 14th) Richard Atkins, esq was directed to officiate as  judge-advocate of the colony, in the absence of the gentleman who had  filled that situation since the first establishment of the settlement,  and who had now proceeded to England in the _Britannia_.    This judicial appointment having taken place, a criminal court was held  on the 23rd, and continued sitting, by adjournment, until the 29th, when  sentence of death was passed upon eight prisoners who were capitally  convicted; one, of the wilful murder of the man whose body had been found  on the north shore the 16th of last month, and seven of robbing the  public store-houses at Sydney, and the settlement at the Hawkesbury. Two  others were found guilty of manslaughter.    Of these miserable people five were executed pursuant to the sentence of  the court. At Sydney*, Francis Morgan, for wilful murder, with Martin  McEwen (a soldier) and John Lawler (a convict), for robbing the public  stores. Matthew McNally and Thomas Doyle, convicts, suffered at  Parramatta, on the following day, for the same offence.    [* On the 30th of November, and the others on the 9th and 10th of  December.]    Having thus satisfied the public justice of the country, the governor  extended the hand of mercy to the three others who had been capitally  convicted of the same crime, viz John McDouall (another soldier), Thomas  Inville, and Michael Doland (convicts), by granting them a conditional  pardon.    It was much to be lamented, that these people were not to be deterred by  any example from the practice of robbing the public stores, which had of  late been more frequent than heretofore, and for which there could not be  admitted the shadow of an excuse; as the whole of the inhabitants of  every description were at this very time on a full and liberal allowance  of provisions and clothing, neither of which were in any scarcity in the  settlement. But the cause was to be found in the too great indulgence in  the use of spirituous liquors which had been obtained among them for a  considerable time past. The different capital crimes which had lately  been brought before the court of criminal judicature, together with the  various petty offences that daily came under the cognisance of the  magistrates, did not proceed from an insufficiency either of food or  clothing; but from an inordinate desire of possessing, by any means  whatsoever, those articles with which they might be able to procure  spirits, 'that source--as the governor expressed himself in an order  which he published directly after these executions--that source of the  misfortunes of all those whom the laws of their country, and the justice  that was due to others, had launched into eternity, surrounded with the  crimes of an ill-spent life.'    The court having ordered that Francis Morgan should be hung in chains  upon the small island which is situated in the middle of the harbour, and  named by the natives Mat-te-wan-ye, a gibbet was accordingly erected, and  he was hung there, exhibiting an object of much greater terror to the  natives, than to the white people, many of whom were more inclined to  make a jest of it; but to the natives his appearance was so  frightful--his clothes shaking in the wind, and the creaking of his  irons, added to their superstitious ideas of ghosts (for these children  of ignorance imagined that, like a ghost, this man might have the power  of taking hold of them by the throat), all rendering him such an alarming  object to them--that they never trusted themselves near him, nor the spot  on which he hung; which, until this time, had ever been with them a  favourite place of resort.    The _Prince of Wales_, having been cleared of her cargo, sailed on  the 23rd for China. Previous to her departure, the master having  complained of the conduct of his ship's company, the governor appointed a  day for their appearing before him; when the differences which subsisted  between them were inquired into by his excellency, and settled to the  satisfaction of all parties.    The public works in which the people at Sydney had been employed during  this month, consisted in receiving the cargoes of the two victuallers,  and in clearing out the tanks or reservoirs for water, which had become a  necessary work, as they never had been emptied or cleansed since they  were first cut and filled in the year 1792.*    [* The principal tank contained about 7996 gallons of water.
