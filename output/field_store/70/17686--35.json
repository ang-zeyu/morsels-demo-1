What would happen?  He would be as completely exhausted as though he had  experienced a major surgical operation or had run a Marathon race.    A close analogy to the reflex process in the fighting of animals  is shown in the role played by the sexual receptors in conjugation.  Adequate stimulation of either of these two distinct groups  of receptors, the sexual and the noci, causes specific behavior--  the one toward embrace, the other toward repulsion.  Again, one of  the most peremptory causes of the discharge of energy is that due  to an attempt to obstruct forcibly the mouth and the nose so that  asphyxia is threatened.  Under such conditions neither friend  nor foe is trusted, and a desperate struggle for air ensues.  It will be readily granted that the reactions to prevent suffocation  were established for the purpose of self-preservation, but the discharge  of nerve-muscular energy to this particular end is no more specific  and no more shows adaptive qualities than do the preceding examples.  Even the proposal to bind one down hand and foot excites resentment,  a feeling originally suggested by the need for self-preservation.  No patient views with equanimity the application of shackles  as a preparation for anesthesia.    We have now considered some of the causes of those discharges of nervous  energy which result from various types of harmful physical contact,  and have referred to the analogous, though antithetical,  response to the stimulation of the sexual receptors.  The response to the adequate stimuli of each of the several receptors  is a discharge of nerve-muscular energy of a specific type; that is,  there is one type of response for the ear, one for the larynx,  one for the pharynx, another for the nose, another for the eye,  another for the deep ticklish points of the chest and the abdomen,  quite another for the delicate tickling of the skin, and still  another type of response to sexual stimuli.    According to Sherrington, a given receptor has a low threshold  for only one, its own specific stimulus, and a high threshold  for all others; that is, the doors that guard the nerve-paths  to the brain are opened only when the proper password is received.  According to Sherrington's law, the individual as a whole responds  to but one stimulus at a time, that is, only one stimulus  occupies the nerve-paths which carry the impulses as a result  of which acts are performed, _i.  e_., the final common path.  As soon as a stronger stimulus reaches the brain it dispossesses  whatever other stimulus is then occupying the final common path--  the path of action.  The various receptors have a definite order  of precedence over each other (Sherrington). For example, the impulse  from the delicate ticklish points of the skin, whose adequate  stimulus is an insect-like contact, could not successfully compete  for the final common path with the stimulus of a nociceptor.  The stimulus of a fly on the nose would be at once superseded by  the crushing of a finger.  In quick succession do the various receptors  (Sherrington) occupy the final common path, but each stimulus is for  the time the sole possessor, hence the nervous system is integrated  (connected) to act as a whole.  Each individual at every moment  of life has a limited amount of dischargeable nervous energy.  This energy is at the disposal of any stimulus that obtains possession  of the final common path, and results in the performance of an act.  Each discharge of energy is subtracted from the sum total of stored  energy and, whether the subtractions are made by the excitation  of nociceptors by trauma, by tickling, by fighting, by fear,  by flight, or by the excitation of sexual receptors, by any  of these singly or in combination with others, the sum total of  the expenditure of energy, if large enough, produces exhaustion.  Apparently there is no distinction between that state of exhaustion  which is due to the discharge of nervous energy in response  to trauma and that due to other causes.  The manner of the  discharge of energy is specific for each type of stimulation.  On this conception, traumatic shock takes its place as a natural  phenomenon and is divested of its mask of mystery.      The Discharge of Energy through Stimulation of the Distance Receptors,  or through Representation of Injury (Psychic)      We will now turn from the discussion of the discharge of nervous energy by  mechanical stimuli to the discharge of energy through mental perception.  _Phylogenetic_ association may result from stimulation of the distance  receptors through sight, hearing, smell, or by a representation  of physical experiences, as well as from physical contact.  The effect upon the organism of the representation of injury  or of the perception of danger through the distance receptors is  designated FEAR.  Fear is as widely distributed in nature as is its cause,  that is, fear is as widely distributed as injury.  Animals under  the stimulus of fear, according to W. T. Hornaday, not only may exhibit  preternatural strength, but also may show strategy of the highest order,  a strategy not seen under the influence of a lesser stimulus.  In some animals fear is so intense that it defeats escape; this is  especially true in the case of birds in the presence of snakes.  The power of flight has endowed the bird with an easy means of escape  from snakes, especially when the encounter is in the tops of trees.  Here the snake must move cautiously, else he will lose his equilibrium;  his method of attack is by stealth.  When the snake has stalked  its prey, the bird is often so overcome by fear that it cannot fly  and so becomes an easy victim (Fig. 11). The phenomena of fear  are described by Darwin as follows:    \"Fear is often preceded by astonishment, and is so near akin to it that  both lead to the senses of sight and hearing being instantly aroused.  In both cases the eyes and mouth are widely opened and the  eyebrows raised.  The frightened man at first stands like a statue,  motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if instinctively  to escape observation.  The heart beats quickly and violently,  so that it palpitates or knocks against the ribs.  * * * That the skin  is much affected under the sense of great fear we see in the marvelous  and inexplicable manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it.  This exudation is all the more remarkable as the surface is then cold,  and hence the term, `a cold sweat'; whereas the sudorific glands  are properly excited into action when the surface is heated.  The hairs also on the skin stand erect, and the superficial  muscles shiver.  In connection with the disturbed action of the heart,  the breathing is hurried.  The salivary glands act imperfectly;  the mouth becomes dry, and is often opened and shut.  I have also  noticed that under slight fear there is a strong tendency to yawn.  One of the best-marked symptoms is the trembling of all the  muscles of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips.  From this cause, and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice  becomes husky and indistinct, or may altogether fail.  * * * As fear increases into agony of terror, we behold, as under  all violent emotions, diversified results.  The heart beats wildly,  or may fail to act and faintness ensues; there is death-like pallor;  the breathing is labored; the wings of the nostrils are widely dilated;  `there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor  on the hollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat';  the uncovered and protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror;  or they may roll restlessly from side to side.  * * * The pupils  are said to be enormously dilated.  All the muscles of the body  may become rigid, or may be thrown into convulsive movements.  The hands are alternately clenched and opened, often with a  twitching movement.  The arms may be protruded, as if to avert  some dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head.  * * * In other cases there is a sudden and uncontrollable tendency  to headlong flight; and so strong is this that the boldest soldiers  may be seized with a sudden panic.  As fear rises to an extreme pitch,  the dreadful scream of terror is heard.  Great beads of sweat  stand on the skin.  All the muscles of the body are relaxed.  Utter prostration soon follows, and the mental powers fail.  The intestines are affected.  The sphincter muscles cease  to act and no longer retain the contents of the body.  * * * Men, during numberless generations, have endeavored  to escape from their enemies or danger by headlong flight,  or by violently struggling with them; and such great exertions  will have caused the heart to beat rapidly, the breathing to  be hurried, the chest to heave, and the nostrils to be dilated.  As these exertions have often been prolonged to the last extremity,  the final result will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration,  trembling of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation.  And now, whenever the emotion of fear is strongly felt, though it  may not lead to any exertion, the same results tend to reappear,  through the force of inheritance and association\"[*] (Fig. 12).      [*] Darwin:  Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.      In an experimental research, we found evidence that the physiologic  phenomena of fear have a physical basis.  This evidence is found  in the morphologic alterations in the brain-cells, which are similar  to those observed in certain stages of surgical shock and in fatigue  from muscular exertion (Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 13). For the present,  we shall assume that fear is a REPRESENTATION of trauma.
