The abrupt transition from the gravity of the  pulpit to the flippancy of the bar I should not admire; but the  consistency of the reverend gentleman here attracted my notice.  I had been just listening to him while he repeated, with devotional  elongation, the solemn words of the burial service; and when I heard him  with the same elongation of sound, address himself to me--\"Shall I  trouble you to cut up the fowl--can I help you to some tongue, sir?\"  I confess that I felt tempted not to laugh, but to comment on the  oddly-contrasted feelings which the same voice, thus variously exerted,  inspired.    Horror-struck, as I had been, at the first mention of the unfeeling word  \"breakfast,\" my excuse for staying was to see if others could eat. That  _I_ should take food was quite out of the question. But the wing of a  fowl having been put on my plate, I thought it would be rudeness to  reject it. I began to eat, inwardly reflecting that my abstinence would  nothing benefit those whose sufferings I had still in my memory; and  improving on this reconciling thought, I presently detected myself  holding my plate for a second supply. \"O sentiment!\" I mentally  exclaimed, \"what art thou when opposed to a breakfast?\"    By the time we had disposed of our first cup of tea, we had got through  the pious reflections which each of us had to offer on the particular  occasion which had brought us together, and conversation started in a  livelier vein. The gentleman who had assisted the ordinary, by praying  with the culprits, gaily remarked to him, with a benevolent chuckle on  his face, that _they_ (meaning himself and the reverend gentleman) had  succeeded in refuting the Unitarian principles which A---- (one of the  sufferers) had for some time avowed. The look which answered this  speech, reminded me, I know not why, of the _organist's_ comment on the  _organ blower's_ assertion that _they_ had played famously well.    \"Ay,\" said the minister, \"I knew it would be so. I told him so  immediately after sentence. But, after all, what can we say for a  recantation dictated by the dread of early death?\"    \"Very true!\" was my exclamation, as the reverend gentleman looked as if  he expected me to say something.    \"At any rate,\" whispered a gentleman well-known in the city, with whom  I had formerly done a little business in the funds, \"it gives a man  something of an _option_.\"    This technical application of a favourite stock-exchange word produced a  general smile round the table, and I could not help contributing to  lengthen it by replying--    \"You mean, perhaps, that it gives him a _call_.\" But the lively sheriff,  of whose witticisms I have already made honourable mention, cut me out  of my share of applause altogether, as clean as a whistle, by instantly  rejoining--    \"The _put_ you mean, for, in this case, the party was going for the  _fall_.\"    Of course there was no standing this, and we all joined in the laugh.    We were however brought back to gravity through the alarm expressed by  the minister, at the idea of his having taken cold through officiating  that morning without his wig.  This introduced, I cannot tell how, some  remarks on the head, which led to a disquisition on craniology. On this  subject the witty sheriff was very amusing. _I_ said some tolerably  lively things; but the ordinary beat us all hollow, when it was  contended that the disposition and the mind might be known from the  exterior of the skull, by remarking that he had now an additional reason  to regret having come there without his wig.    With this epigrammatic touch he took his leave, I and the rest of the  company laughing heartily, and having eaten as heartily as we then  laughed. The facetious sheriff now had it all his own way, and said  several things, nearly, or perhaps, quite as good as those which I have  already placed on record. We were thus pleasantly engaged, when the  aide-de-camp of the gallant officer in the blue and gold,--one of the  city marshal's-men, entered to announce that it was past nine o'clock,  and to ask if any of the company chose to see the bodies taken down.    \"The bodies!\" I repeated to myself, and the application of that word to  those whom I had previously heard mentioned but by their names, recalled  my thoughts which had somehow strayed from the business of the morning  into unlooked-for cheerfulness, and presented, in that simple  expression, an epitome of all that had moved my wonder, curiosity, and  commiseration.    Again we passed through those parts of the prison which I had twice  before traversed. We advanced with a quicker step than when following  those whom we now expected to see brought to us. But with all the  expedition we could use, on reaching the room from which the scaffold  could be seen, we found the \"bodies\" already there. Nor was this, in my  opinion, the least striking scene which the morning brought under my  observation. The dead men were extended side by side, on the stone  floor. The few persons present gazed on them in silence, duly impressed  with the melancholy spectacle. But in this part of the building a copper  is established, in which a portion of the provisions for its inmates is  prepared. There was a savoury smell of soup, which we could not help  inhaling while we gazed on death. The cooks too were in attendance, and  though they, as became them, did all in their power to look decorously  dismal, well as they managed their faces, they could not so divest  themselves of their professional peculiarities, as not to awaken  thoughts which involuntarily turned to ludicrous or festive scenes.  Their very costume was at variance with the general gloom, and no  sympathy could at once repress the jolly rotundity of their persons.    I turned my eyes from them, wishing to give myself wholly up to  religious meditation during the moments of my stay. Just then the  executioner approach, ed. Sir Thomas desired him to remove the cap from  the face of one of the sufferers. He prepared to comply--but his first  act was to place his hand on the more prominent features and press them  together. This, on inquiry being made, I learned was done that the  bystanders might not be shocked by witnessing any distortion of  countenance. Sir Thomas smiled at the anxiety of the man to make it  appear that his work had been well performed. The cap was then  withdrawn. There was nothing terrific in the aspect of the deceased.  I recognized the features of the young man who had been so wildly,  so violently agitated, when about to suffer. Now pain was at an end,  apprehension was no more, and he seemed in the enjoyment of sweet  repose. His countenance was tranquil as that of a sleeping infant, and  happier than the infant, his rest was not in danger of being disturbed.  While reflecting on the change which a single hour had sufficed to  produce, I could hardly help regarding as idle the the sorrow, the pity,  and the self-reproach for momentary forgetfulness of these, which I had  felt and breathed within that period. I almost accused the sufferers of  weakness, for showing themselves depressed as they had been, while I  felt disposed, seeing their griefs were, to all appearance, terminated  for ever, to demand with the poet,        \"And what is death we so unwisely fear?\"      and to answer as he replies to himself,        \"An end of all our busy tumults here.\"      _Knight's Quarterly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      JEU D'ESPRIT.    (_For the Mirror._)        A sanctified hermit was heard to complain    That raiment and food he no longer could gain.    \"For,\" quoth he \"in this village the famine's so great    That there's not enough left e'en a mousetrap to bait.\"      A neighbour who happened to bear his sad plaint    Addressed in the following manner the saint:    \"The nation will keep thee to support splendour's throne,    And interest will pay thee, because thou'rt _alone_.\"--(a loan.)

[Illustration: September]      SEPTEMBER.        \"Now sober Autumn, with lack lustre eye,    Shakes with a chiding blast the yellow leaf,        And hears the woodman's song        And early sportsman's foot.\"      September is generally accounted the finest and most settled month in  the year. The mornings and evenings are cool, but possess a delightful  freshness, while the middle of the day is pleasantly warm and open.  Hence the well-known proverb:        \"September blows soft till the fruit's in the loft.\"      The destruction of the partridge commences with this month, large coveys  of which may now be seen about the stubble fields, and in the corn, if  any be left standing. These birds get very shy towards the end of the  month, in consequence of being repeatedly fired at. Sportsmen,  therefore, prefer the early part of the season, before the birds get too  wild. Partridges, while the corn is standing, have a secure retreat from  their numerous enemies; but when the harvest is gathered in, they resort  in the day-time to groves and covers. At night, however, they return to  the stubble to avoid foxes and weasels, &c., and there nestle together.    The swallow now takes his departure for milder regions, and many other  of the small billed birds that feed on insects disappear when the cold  weather commences. The _throstle_, the _red-wing_, and the _fieldfare_,  which migrated in March, now return; and the _ring-ouzel_ arrives from  the Welsh and Scottish Alps to winter in more sheltered situations. All  these birds feed upon berries, of which there is a plentiful supply,  in our woods, during a great part of their stay. The throstle and the  red-wing are delicate eating. The Romans kept thousands of them together  in aviaries, and fed them with a sort of paste made of bruised figs and  flour, &c., to improve the delicacy and flavour of their flesh.

On my telling the man that I had been in his room, he seemed much  astonished at my boldness; for he assured me, that he carried a loaded  pistol in every one of his six waistcoat pockets. I learnt also from this  man, that he has or had considerable property in Jamaica; that he has  lived in the premises at Lilley about twenty-three years, and during  fourteen of them pursued his alchemical researches with unremitting  ardour; but for the last few years shut himself up as a close prisoner,  and lived in the manner I have described.           *       *       *       *       *        Here lyeth wrapt in clay,    The body of William Wray:    I have no more to say.      _Weever's Epitaphs_.           *       *       *       *       *          Notes of a Reader.           *       *       *       *       *      COURT OF CHARLES II.      In the last No. of the _Edinburgh Review_, there is an admirably written  article on Hallam's \"Constitutional History,\" not a mere essay, but  somewhat more like a review than usual. It contains an abundance of  florid, bold, and vigorous writing, extending through upwards of 70  pages. Among the most striking passages we notice a parallel between  Cromwell and Napoleon, drawn with considerable force. But our extract is  from the lighter portion, as the following ludicrous sketches of some of  the enormities of Charles II. \"Towards the close of the Protectorate,  many signs indicated that a time of license was at hand. But the  restoration of Charles II rendered the change wonderfully rapid and  violent. A deep and general taint infected the morals of the most  influential classes, and spread itself through every province of  letters. Poetry inflamed the passions; philosophy undermined the  principles; divinity itself, inculcating an abject reverence for the  court, gave additional effect to its licentious example. ... The  favourite duchess stamps about Whitehall, cursing and swearing. The  ministers employ their time at the council board in making mouths at  each other, and taking off each other's gestures for the amusement of  the king. The peers at a conference begin to pommel each other, and to  tear collars and periwigs. A speaker in the House of Commons gives  offence to the court. He is way-laid by a gang of bullies, and his nose  is cut to the bone. ... The second generation of the statesmen of this  reign, were worthy of the schools in which they had been trained, of the  gaming table of Grammont, and the tiring room of Nell ----.\" This is but  a small portion of the good set terms in which the reviewer illustrates  the licentiousness of the times. Speaking of Clarendon, he says, \"Mr.  Hallam scarcely makes sufficient allowance for the wear and tear which  honesty almost necessarily sustains in the friction of political life,  and which in times so rough as those through which Clarendon passed,  must be very considerable. When these are fairly estimated, we think  that his integrity may be allowed to pass muster.\" Perhaps political  honesty is like Joseph Surface's French plate, or the tinsel spread over  a pair of Birmingham saleshop candlesticks, whose tenderness will not  withstand the wear and tear of conveyance in the purchaser's pocket. But  the oddity of the reviewer's comparisons even puts one in good humour  with their virulence.           *       *       *       *       *      STREET SYMPATHIES.      During \"the season\" the veriest stranger who has an eye and ear, and  thoughts, must find in London sufficient to occupy his attention; true,  he may start and sigh, to think that of the busy and enormous multitude  around him, not one would care, if, treading on yonder bit of orange peel,  he should slip off the flagway, and falling beneath the wheel of that  immense coal-wagon, have his thigh crushed to atoms, while you'd be  saying \"Jack Robinson.\" But if he do sigh, the more fool he; first,  because \"grieving's a folly,\" as the old sea song hath it; next because  he is mistaken in supposing that no one would feel interested in his  misfortune. There are two upon the very flagway with him, who would  evince the greatest sympathy in his fate; the one is a surgeon's  apprentice, who, with anxious care, would bear him off to _his_  hospital, that he might \"try his 'prentice hand\" to doctor him while  living, and dissect him when dead; and the other is a running reporter to  one of the morning papers, who would with gentle and soothing accents  inquire his name, condition, and abode, to swell the paragraph, and  increase his pay.--_Blackwood's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      LINES TO EDWARD LYTTON BULWER, ON THE BIRTH OF HIS CHILD.        My heart is with you, Bulwer, and portrays    The blessings of your first paternal days;    To clasp the pledge of purest, holiest faith,    To taste one's own and love-born infant's breath,    I know, nor would for worlds forget the bliss.    I've felt that to a father's heart that kiss,    As o'er its little lips you smile and cling,    Has fragrance which Arabia could not bring.      Such are the joys, ill mock'd in ribald song,    In thought, ev'n fresh'ning life our life-time long,    That give our souls on earth a heaven-drawn bloom;    Without them we are weeds upon a tomb.      Joy be to thee, and her whose lot with thine,    Propitious stars saw Truth and Passion twine!    Joy be to her who in your rising name    Feels Love's bower brighten'd by the beams of Fame!    I lack'd a father's claim to her--but knew    Regard for her young years so pure and true,    That, when she at the altar stood your bride,    A sire could scarce have felt more sire-like pride.      _T. Campbell_.           *       *       *       *       *      The Duc de Laval has the character of being a perfect fool.

Infinite are the consequences which follow from a single, and often  apparently a very insignificant circumstance. Paley himself narrowly  escaped being a baker; here was a decision upon which hung in one scale,  perhaps, the immortal interests of thousands, and, in the other, the  gratification  of the taste of the good people of Giggleswick for hot  rolls. Cromwell was near being strangled in his cradle by a monkey; here  was this wretched ape wielding in his paws the destinies of nations.  Then, again, how different in their kind, as well as in their magnitude,  are these consequences from anything that might have been _a priori_  expected. Henry VIII. is smitten with the beauty of a girl of eighteen;  and ere long,        \"The Reformation beams from Bullen's eyes.\"      Charles Wesley refuses to go with his wealthy namesake to Ireland, and  the inheritance, which would have been his, goes to build up the  fortunes of a Wellesley instead of a Wesley; and to this decision of a  schoolboy (as Mr. Southey observes) Methodism may owe its existence, and  England its military--and, we trust we may now add, its civil and  political--glory--_Quarterly Rev._           *       *       *       *       *      SERVANTS.      A fund has lately been established at Stockholm, from which it is  intended to reward good and faithful servants. The king has contributed  to it 1,000 crowns; the prince royal 500; and the princess royal 300.  This has been suggested as an example worthy of our imitation; many  legacies, &c. have from time to time been bequeathed for the  encouragement of faithful servants in England; some are claimed, but the  majority are shamefully misapplied by those to whom their distribution  has been entrusted.           *       *       *       *       *      LONDON LUXURIES.      A capital like London is a Maelstrom--an immense whirlpool--whose  gyrations sweep in whatever is peculiarly desirable from the most  distant regions of the empire--so active becomes the love of gain when  set in motion by the love of luxury. We recollect once being on shipboard  to the north of Duncan's Bay Head, and out of sight of land, the nearest  being the Feroe Islands:--we were walking the deck, watching a whale  which was gamboling at some distance, throwing up his huge side to the  sun, and sending ever and anon a sheet of water and foam from his  nostrils. Our thoughts were on Hecla and on the icebergs of the Pole, on  the Scalds of Iceland and the sea-kings of Norway, when a sail hove in  sight: we asked what craft it was--and were answered, \"a Gravesend brig  dredging for lobsters.\" Never was enchantment so effectually  broken--never stage-trick in pantomime more successfully played off.

To be convinced that, at some period or another of their history, the  Egyptians had conceived a _beau-ideal_ superior to the beautiful  which nature habitually produced in their country, we have only to  examine the young Memnon, at the British Museum, and the heads of many of  the sphinxes which remain.--_Weekly Rev._           *       *       *       *       *      ALGEBRA.
