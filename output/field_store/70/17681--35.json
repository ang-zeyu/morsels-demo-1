It runs in my head now that the man was my father (who has  been dead for some years), though I am not sure about this, while there is  no recollection of who the woman was. Now it appeared that there was some  woman in the crowd who had some peculiar evil influence over every one and  whom everybody feared. This man and woman were planning to slip off from  this wicked woman and meet me and the one with me on the road, and in some  way, which is not now clear, we were to circumvent this bad woman and break  her power.  The man explained and explained to me that we were to meet at  certain springs which were at the side of the road, but it seemed that I  could not get it into my head where they were, and I was afraid I would not  stop at the right place. At last I thought I knew where he meant, and told  him that I would stop there and wait until he came up, but then I happened  to think that he might be ahead of me anyhow, and could stop and wait for  me; then I was sure he would be ahead, for I remembered that I had to  harness and hitch up the horse and his was all ready. And now we seemed to  be getting our horses, and I remarked to him that I was not a bit good hand  at working with horses, and he expressed his sympathy that I had this work  to do.    Here was a second break in the dream, and I was standing in a hallway,  looking through a window into a room.  In this room sat my wife and the evil  woman whom everybody feared.  She had learned our play (I was conscious of  this in the dream), and was determined to have her revenge, and prevent us  carrying out our plan.  She had hypnotized my wife, and had her scared so  that she was in great mental agony. I heard her saying, \"Now you are a big  black cat,\" or something much like this, at any rate making her think she  was a cat and at the same time leaving her partly conscious of who she was.  This woman looked exactly like a woman who lives in the neighborhood where  my wife is now visiting and of whom she has always been somewhat afraid  because of her sharp tongue and unpleasant ways.  Immediately, I was filled  with a great fear for my wife and with a raging anger against the woman. I  broke out into calling her all kinds of names, especially saying, \"You  devil, you devil,\" and trying to get through the window to her. I tore out  the screen, but had a great deal of difficulty in doing so. When I had  finally succeeded in tearing the screen out, I threw it at her head, but she  did not dodge, but sat boldly upright and seemed to defy me.  Then I tried  to jump through the window to get to her, but was so weak that I could not  do so; this seems strange since the window was not more than three feet from  the floor.  I was making unsuccessful attempts to get through, and was  railing at the woman when S. awoke me. I awoke weak, and for some time  continued to feel frightened, though not enough so to keep me from talking  and writing out the dream. I got up and put up the windows (since the rain  had stopped), and about this time a very fair explanation of parts of the  dream came to me. I immediately told it to S., in order to keep from  forgetting it, and then decided to write it down, which I proceeded to do.    Parts of the dream seem to analyze very nicely, but there are parts which  seem to resist analysis; I did not try to force the analysis but gave only  the part which came spontaneously. In the first part of the dream I was  driving in a buggy, I crossed a creek and had trouble with unharnessing a  horse. Several times recently, I have mentioned the fact that I never liked  to work with horses, even when on the farm at home. I do not remember of  having mentioned this fact on the day of the dream, but Mr. C. had stopped  in to call on me that evening and had mentioned that he drove in in a buggy.  I had not seen the buggy and had wondered what he did with it, and had not  remembered to ask him.  He had also told me that he was going to a place  called Yellow Springs; I knew about where Yellow Springs are, but could not  quite place them and had tried to figure out what direction he would go.  This seemed to come out very clearly in the dream, when I was trying to find  out where these unknown springs by the side of the road were.  I had related  during the evening how I recently fell into a creek with my clothes on and  this probably accounted for the creek over which I drove in the dream. In  the dim second part of the dream, the rotunda seems to have resembled the  chapel of the new college building which is being builded, and about which I  was talking that afternoon.    The last part of the dream seems to have been the important part, and in it  several of the Freudian mechanisms show up very plainly. Just before going  to bed, I had read an article about Vera Cheberiak, the Russian murderess of  the Mendel Beilis case, and how she is now engaged in suing different people  for slander. The article had described her as coolly and impudently sitting  up in court and seeming to realize her power over her enemies, and it had  also made a point of the great fear in which she is held. I had read another  article about the city of Salem, which has recently burned, and I had  remembered that it was the \"witch\" town of colonial days where people were  supposed to be turned into black cats. I had read still another article,  descriptive of country life, which described how a man had climbed a tree  after a cat which was eating young robins.  I had just a day or two before  received a letter from my wife, which contained the news that she was going  to visit this woman whom she fears, but whom she must visit because of their  social relation As already mentioned, the woman in the dream looked just  like this one, and it will readily be recognized that the dream woman was a  condensation of Vera Cheberiak, a Salem \"witch,\" and the woman whom my wife  fears. The fact that she was hypnotized into thinking she was a cat would  naturally accompany the Salem witch, and the cat in the apple tree,  concerning which I had read, might also have entered the dream. Aside from  these, there is another element which may have been instrumental in causing  my wife to be punished by thinking she was a cat. I once saw a woman who was  suffering from melancholia who thought she was a cat, and her mental  suffering seemed to me to be about the keenest of any that I have ever  observed, this possibly caused the dream-making factor to represent her as  thinking she was a cat. The hall, window and screen are also easy of  explanation. That evening I had examined a window which opens from our  bedroom into a hall, and had wondered whether we would continue to keep it  curtained this year or take the curtains away. When I put down the windows  to keep out the driving rain, I had had trouble with a screen much as I did  in the dream.    The heart of the dream seems to be in this last scene. That morning (it was  Sunday) I had very unwillingly, and from a sense of duty, gone to a tiresome  and long-drawn-out church service.  I had become so fatigued during the  service, and so disagreed with some of the things the preacher said, that I  was conscious of a mild desire to swear and throw something. I had  humorously mentioned this fact after the service, but there was quite an  element of truth in the jest. The dream gave me the chance of my life to  fulfil this desire, and I seized the opportunity by breaking into a stream  of profanity (not very successful profanity, I fear, as I never use it when  awake and therefore was not in good practice) and throwing the screen at the  woman.  But was there not a deeper meaning than this in the dream?  I think  so decidedly; it seems that it would be a lot of trouble to construct such a  tremendous nightmare just to give me an opportunity to swear and throw  something, because a preacher had been somewhat tiresome.  There was  evidently a deeper and more subtle wish which was also fulfilled. That  evening I had walked up the railroad track with a crowd of young people and  where the paths crossed we had all split up and gone different directions.  Two young ladies had gone back to their boarding places across the campus,  and I had suggested to the young fellow with me that we go along with them.  However, he objected, and we walked back down the railroad track. Now, it  had occurred to me that he probably thought I was not within my bounds as a  married man when I wanted to walk back with these young ladies; something of  the same idea had come to me that day when some one had said in a  conversation, \"Professor B. is the most satisfied man on the campus whose  wife is away.\" I had wondered if they thought I did not care for my wife and  vaguely wished I had some way of showing my love for her, and, more than  that, these suggestions had very naturally made me wonder if I really care  for her as much as I should. I could not have asked for a better opportunity  to serve and show my love for my wife than the dream gave me, and at the  same time it assured me of my affection for her. There is still another  element of repression in this and that is that I have for some time been  wanting to forcibly express myself against the unpleasant ways of this lady  whom my wife so fears. In the dream, I very freely and fully followed this  desire.    This far I can go in the analysis and feel sure of my ground. It will be  noticed that I have not resorted to symbolism, and have made very little  technical use even of the Freudian mechanisms. I could very easily plunge  into symbolism and more elaborate analysis, but should I do so I fear I  would be in the same condition as a bright young scholar who made an  elaborate study of Freudian theories. He expressed himself by saying that it  was a \"chaotic inferno.\" This analysis will seem very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I.

Sec. 3. _The Purificatory Theory of the Fire-festivals_, pp.  341-346.--Theory that the fires at the festivals are purificatory, being  intended to burn up all harmful things, 341; the purificatory or  destructive effect of the fires is often alleged by the people who light  them, and there is no reason to reject this explanation, 341 _sq._; the  great evil against which the fire at the festivals appears to be  directed is witchcraft, 342; among the evils for which the  fire-festivals are deemed remedies the foremost is cattle-disease, and  cattle-disease is often supposed to be an effect of witchcraft, 343  _sq._; again, the bonfires are thought to avert hail, thunder,  lightning, and various maladies, all of which are attributed to the  maleficent arts of witches, 344 _sq._; the burning wheels rolled down  hill and the burning discs thrown into the air may be intended to burn  the invisible witches, 345 _sq._; on this view the fertility supposed to  follow the use of fire results indirectly from breaking the spells of  witches, 346; on the whole the theory of the purificatory or destructive  intention of the fire-festivals seems the more probable, 346.    [Transcriber's Note: The brief descriptions often found enclosed in  square brackets are \"sidenotes\", which appeared in the original book in  the margins of the paragraph following the \"sidenote.\" Footnotes were  originally at the bottoms of the printed pages.]          CHAPTER I    BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH      Sec. 1. _Not to touch the Earth_      [The priest of Aricia and the Golden Bough]    We have travelled far since we turned our backs on Nemi and set forth in  quest of the secret of the Golden Bough. With the present volume we  enter on the last stage of our long journey. The reader who has had the  patience to follow the enquiry thus far may remember that at the outset  two questions were proposed for answer: Why had the priest of Aricia to  slay his predecessor? And why, before doing so, had he to pluck the  Golden Bough?[1] Of these two questions the first has now been answered.  The priest of Aricia, if I am right, was one of those sacred kings or  human divinities on whose life the welfare of the community and even the  course of nature in general are believed to be intimately dependent. It  does not appear that the subjects or worshippers of such a spiritual  potentate form to themselves any very clear notion of the exact  relationship in which they stand to him; probably their ideas on the  point are vague and fluctuating, and we should err if we attempted to  define the relationship with logical precision. All that the people  know, or rather imagine, is that somehow they themselves, their cattle,  and their crops are mysteriously bound up with their divine king, so  that according as he is well or ill the community is healthy or sickly,  the flocks and herds thrive or languish with disease, and the fields  yield an abundant or a scanty harvest. The worst evil which they can  conceive of is the natural death of their ruler, whether he succumb to  sickness or old age, for in the opinion of his followers such a death  would entail the most disastrous consequences on themselves and their  possessions; fatal epidemics would sweep away man and beast, the earth  would refuse her increase, nay the very frame of nature itself might be  dissolved. To guard against these catastrophes it is necessary to put  the king to death while he is still in the full bloom of his divine  manhood, in order that his sacred life, transmitted in unabated force to  his successor, may renew its youth, and thus by successive transmissions"]]]
