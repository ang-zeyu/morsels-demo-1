Ich dich!\" die Maedchein tzwei    \"Ich dich!\" das Niebelrungen drei.      (Tragically)      Die Turnverein ist lieb und dicht      Zum Fest und lieben kleiner Geld,    Der Niebelrungen picht ein Bricht--      Und hitt das Schlabbergasterfeldt!    \"Ich dich! Ich dich!\" die Maedchein schreit    Und so das Schlabbergaster deit!      (Plaintively)      Ach! weh das Niebelrungen spott      Ach! weh das Maedchein Turnverein    Und unser Meister lieben Gott--      Ach! weh das Weinerwurst und Wein!    Ach! weh das Bricht zum kleiner Geld--    Ach! weh das Schlabbergasterfeldt!_    Ever after this Walters gallery incident it was my duty, so he thought,  to keep Field's desk supplied with inks, not only of every color of the  rainbow, but with lake-white, gold, silver, and bronze, and any other  kind which his whim deemed necessary to give eccentric emphasis to some  line, word or letter in whatever he chanced to be composing. His  peremptory requests were generally preferred in writing, addressed \"For  the Lusty Knight, Sir Slosson Thompson, Office,\" and delivered by his  grinning minion, the office factotum. Sometimes they were in verse, as  in the following:      _\"Who spilt my bottle of ink?\" said Field,      \"Who spilt my bottle of ink?\"    And then with a sigh, said Thompson, \"'Twas I--      I broke that bottle of ink,          I think,      And wasted the beautiful ink.\"      \"Who'll buy a bottle of ink?\" asked Field,      \"Who'll buy a bottle of ink?\"    With a still deeper sigh his friend replied, \"I--      I'll buy a bottle of ink          With chink,      I'll buy a bottle of ink!\"      \"Oh, isn't this beautiful ink!\" cried Field,      \"Beautiful bilious ink!\"    He shook the hand of his old friend, and      He tipped him a pleasant wink,          And a blink,      As he went to using that ink._    While Field insisted on a variegated assortment of inks he did not  demand a separate pen for each color. In lieu of these he possessed  himself of an old linen office coat, which he donned when it was cool  enough for a coat and used for a pen-wiper. When the temperature  rendered anything beyond shirt-sleeves superfluous, this linen affair  was hung so conveniently that he could still use it for what he  regarded as its primary use. In warm weather I wore a presentably clean  counterpart of Field's Joseph's coat of many colors. As often as  necessary this went to the laundry. One day when it had just returned  from one of these periodical visits, I was startled, but not surprised,  to find that Field had appropriated my spotless linen duster to his own  inky uses and left his own impossible creation hanging on my hook in  its stead. Field's version of what then occurred is beautifully, if not  truthfully, portrayed in the accompanying \"Proper Sonet\" and life-like  portraits.    If the reader will imagine each mark on the coat, of which \"Nompy\"  bootlessly complains, done in different colors, he will have some idea  of the infinite pains Field bestowed on the details of his epistolary  pranks.    Out of the remarkable series of postal appeals which Field sent to me  when I was visiting in New Brunswick grew an animated correspondence  between Field and my youngest sister. She bore the good old-fashioned  Christian names of Mary Matilda--a combination that struck a responsive  chord in Field's taste in nomenclature, while his \"come at once, we are  starving\" aroused her sense of humor to the point of forwarding an  enormous raised biscuit two thousand miles for the relief of two  Chicago sufferers. The result was an exchange of letters, one of which  has a direct bearing on his whimsical adoption of many-colored inks in  his writing. It read as follows:    [Illustration: A PROPER SONET.  _From a drawing in colors by Eugene Field._      Then Kriee 3 times his breast he smote,      And gruesome oaths swore he;    \"Oh, bring back _mine_, and take _your_ coat--      Your painted coat, the which I note        Full ill besemmeth me!\"    But swere and plede he as he mote,    Old Field said \"No, ol' Nompy, no!    You'll get your coat not none no mo!\"]    [Illustration: FIELD AND BALLANTYNE AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF A BISCUIT  FROM NEW BRUNSWICK.  _From a drawing by Eugene Field._]      [red ink] CHICAGO, May the 7th, 1885.      [blue ink] Dear Miss:      I make bold to send herewith a diagram of the new rooms in which your    brother Slason is now [brown ink] ensconced. The drawing may be bad    and the perspective may be out of plumb, but the motif is good, as    you [green ink] will allow. All that Brother Slason needs now to    symmetrize his new abode is a box from home--a box filled [purple    ink] with those toothsome goodies which only a kind, loving,    indulgent sister can make and donate to an absent [black ink]    brother. Having completed my contribution to the Larned gallery, and    having exhibited the pictures in the [red ink] recent salon, I have a    large supply of colored inks on hand, which fact accounts for that    appearance of an [blue ink] Easter necktie or a crazy quilt which    this note has. In a few days I shall take the liberty of sending    [brown ink] you the third volume of the \"Aunt Mary Matilda\" series--a    tale of unusual power and interest. With [green ink] many reverential    obeisances and respectful assurances of regard, I beg to remain,      [lilac ink]   Your obedient servant,    [purple ink]      EUGENE FIELD,    [red ink]              per    [blue ink]        William Smith,    [brown ink]         Secretary.    This epistle did indeed look like a crazy quilt. There was a change of  color at the beginning of each line, as I have endeavored to indicate.  It is beautifully written and in many respects besides its variegated  aspect is the most perfect specimen of Field's painstaking epistolary  handiwork I know of.    The \"diagram of Mr. Slason Thompson's New Rooms\" accompanying this  letter was entirely worthy of it, and must have afforded him hours of  boyish pleasure. No description can do it justice. He gave a ground  plan of two square rooms with the windows marked in red ink, the doors  in green, the bed, with a little figure on it, in blue, the fireplace  in yellow, chairs and tables in purple, and the \"buttery,\" as he  insisted on calling the bathroom, in brown. As these apartments were in  the Pullman Building, on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Adams  Street, and commanded a glimpse of the lake, Field's diagram included a  representation of Lake Michigan by zigzag lines of blue ink, with a  single fish as long as a street-car, according to his scale, leering at  the spectator from the billowy depths of indigo blue. Everything in the  diagram was carefully identified in the key which accompanied it. An  idea of the infinite attention to detail Field bestowed on such  frivoling as this may be gathered from the accompanying cut of the  Pullman Building, from the seventh story of which I am shown waving a  welcome to the good but \"impecunious knight.\" The inscription, in  Field's handwriting, tells the story.    [Illustration: THE GOOD KNIGHT SLOSSON'S CASTLE.  _From a drawing by Eugene Field._      The good knight Slosson from a watch tower of his castle desenith and    salutith the good Knight Eugene, sans peur et sans monie.]    [Illustration: A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.  _From drawings by Eugene Field._      No. 1    The fair Mary Matilda skimming over the hills and dales of New    Brunswick.

An inkling as to the meaning of these weird pictures may be gleaned  from the letter I sent along with them to my sister, in which I wrote:      I was telling Field the story of your last snow-shoeing party when he    was prompted to the enclosed tragedy in five acts. He hopes that you    will not mistake the stars for mosquitoes, nor fail to comprehend the    terrible fate that has overtaken Eddy Martin at the mouth of the    voracious musquash, whose retreating tail speaks so eloquently of his    toothsome repast. The lone pine tree is a thing that you will enjoy;    also the expression of horror on your own face when you behold the    empty boots of Eddy. There is a tragedy too deep for tears in the    silent monuments of Field's ignorance of moccasins.    In explanation of the final scene in this \"sad, eventful history\" it  should be said that \"poor Eddie\" was a harmless, half-witted giant who  sawed the cord wood and did odd chores about my father's place. This  gives significance to the pendant buck-saw and the lonely wood-horse.  His lance rusts upon the wall and his steed stands silent in the stall.  The reader should not pass from these examples of Field's humor with  pen and ink without marking the changes that come across the face of  the moon as the tragedy unfolds.    That Field found a congenial spirit and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#4)"],[1,"pity that all flesh must put its faith?  How much happier you would be,  how much more of you there would be, if the hammer of a higher God  could smash your small cosmos, scattering the stars like spangles,  and leave you in the open, free like other men to look up as well  as down!\"         And it must be remembered that the most purely practical science  does take this view of mental evil; it does not seek to argue with it  like a heresy but simply to snap it like a spell.  Neither modern  science nor ancient religion believes in complete free thought.  Theology rebukes certain thoughts by calling them blasphemous.  Science rebukes certain thoughts by calling them morbid.  For example,  some religious societies discouraged men more or less from thinking  about sex.  The new scientific society definitely discourages men from  thinking about death; it is a fact, but it is considered a morbid fact.  And in dealing with those whose morbidity has a touch of mania,  modern science cares far less for pure logic than a dancing Dervish.  In these cases it is not enough that the unhappy man should desire truth;  he must desire health.  Nothing can save him but a blind hunger  for normality, like that of a beast.  A man cannot think himself  out of mental evil; for it is actually the organ of thought that has  become diseased, ungovernable, and, as it were, independent.  He can  only be saved by will or faith.  The moment his mere reason moves,  it moves in the old circular rut; he will go round and round his  logical circle, just as a man in a third-class carriage on the Inner  Circle will go round and round the Inner Circle unless he performs  the voluntary, vigorous, and mystical act of getting out at Gower Street.  Decision is the whole business here; a door must be shut for ever.  Every remedy is a desperate remedy.  Every cure is a miraculous cure.  Curing a madman is not arguing with a philosopher; it is casting  out a devil.  And however quietly doctors and psychologists may go  to work in the matter, their attitude is profoundly intolerant--  as intolerant as Bloody Mary.  Their attitude is really this:  that the man must stop thinking, if he is to go on living.  Their counsel is one of intellectual amputation.  If thy HEAD  offend thee, cut it off; for it is better, not merely to enter  the Kingdom of Heaven as a child, but to enter it as an imbecile,  rather than with your whole intellect to be cast into hell--  or into Hanwell.         Such is the madman of experience; he is commonly a reasoner,  frequently a successful reasoner.  Doubtless he could be vanquished  in mere reason, and the case against him put logically.  But it can  be put much more precisely in more general and even aesthetic terms.  He is in the clean and well-lit prison of one idea:  he is  sharpened to one painful point.  He is without healthy hesitation  and healthy complexity.  Now, as I explain in the introduction,  I have determined in these early chapters to give not so much  a diagram of a doctrine as some pictures of a point of view.  And I  have described at length my vision of the maniac for this reason:  that just as I am affected by the maniac, so I am affected by most  modern thinkers.  That unmistakable mood or note that I hear  from Hanwell, I hear also from half the chairs of science and seats  of learning to-day; and most of the mad doctors are mad doctors  in more senses than one.  They all have exactly that combination we  have noted:  the combination of an expansive and exhaustive reason  with a contracted common sense.  They are universal only in the  sense that they take one thin explanation and carry it very far.  But a pattern can stretch for ever and still be a small pattern.  They see a chess-board white on black, and if the universe is paved  with it, it is still white on black.  Like the lunatic, they cannot  alter their standpoint; they cannot make a mental effort and suddenly  see it black on white.         Take first the more obvious case of materialism.  As an explanation  of the world, materialism has a sort of insane simplicity.  It has  just the quality of the madman's argument; we have at once the sense  of it covering everything and the sense of it leaving everything out.  Contemplate some able and sincere materialist, as, for instance,  Mr. McCabe, and you will have exactly this unique sensation.  He understands everything, and everything does not seem  worth understanding.  His cosmos may be complete in every rivet  and cog-wheel, but still his cosmos is smaller than our world.  Somehow his scheme, like the lucid scheme of the madman, seems unconscious  of the alien energies and the large indifference of the earth;  it is not thinking of the real things of the earth, of fighting  peoples or proud mothers, or first love or fear upon the sea.  The earth is so very large, and the cosmos is so very small.  The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in.         It must be understood that I am not now discussing the relation  of these creeds to truth; but, for the present, solely their relation  to health.  Later in the argument I hope to attack the question of  objective verity; here I speak only of a phenomenon of psychology.  I do not for the present attempt to prove to Haeckel that materialism  is untrue, any more than I attempted to prove to the man who thought  he was Christ that he was labouring under an error.  I merely remark  here on the fact that both cases have the same kind of completeness  and the same kind of incompleteness.  You can explain a man's  detention at Hanwell by an indifferent public by saying that it  is the crucifixion of a god of whom the world is not worthy.  The explanation does explain.  Similarly you may explain the order  in the universe by saying that all things, even the souls of men,  are leaves inevitably unfolding on an utterly unconscious tree--  the blind destiny of matter.  The explanation does explain,  though not, of course, so completely as the madman's. But the point  here is that the normal human mind not only objects to both,  but feels to both the same objection.  Its approximate statement  is that if the man in Hanwell is the real God, he is not much  of a god.  And, similarly, if the cosmos of the materialist is the  real cosmos, it is not much of a cosmos.  The thing has shrunk.  The deity is less divine than many men; and (according to Haeckel)  the whole of life is something much more grey, narrow, and trivial  than many separate aspects of it.  The parts seem greater than  the whole.           For we must remember that the materialist philosophy (whether  true or not) is certainly much more limiting than any religion.  In one sense, of course, all intelligent ideas are narrow.  They cannot be broader than themselves.  A Christian is only  restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted.  He cannot think Christianity false and continue to be a Christian;  and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be  an atheist.  But as it happens, there is a very special sense  in which materialism has more restrictions than spiritualism.  Mr. McCabe thinks me a slave because I am not allowed to believe  in determinism.  I think Mr. McCabe a slave because he is not  allowed to believe in fairies.  But if we examine the two vetoes we  shall see that his is really much more of a pure veto than mine.  The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable  amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe.  But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine  the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle.  Poor Mr. McCabe  is not allowed to retain even the tiniest imp, though it might be  hiding in a pimpernel.  The Christian admits that the universe is  manifold and even miscellaneous, just as a sane man knows that he  is complex.  The sane man knows that he has a touch of the beast,  a touch of the devil, a touch of the saint, a touch of the citizen.  Nay, the really sane man knows that he has a touch of the madman.  But the materialist's world is quite simple and solid, just as  the madman is quite sure he is sane.  The materialist is sure  that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation,  just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that  he is simply and solely a chicken.  Materialists and madmen never  have doubts.         Spiritual doctrines do not actually limit the mind as do  materialistic denials.  Even if I believe in immortality I need not think  about it.  But if I disbelieve in immortality I must not think about it.  In the first case the road is open and I can go as far as I like;  in the second the road is shut.  But the case is even stronger,  and the parallel with madness is yet more strange.  For it was our  case against the exhaustive and logical theory of the lunatic that,  right or wrong, it gradually destroyed his humanity.  Now it is the charge  against the main deductions of the materialist that, right or wrong,  they gradually destroy his humanity; I do not mean only kindness,  I mean hope, courage, poetry, initiative, all that is human.  For instance, when materialism leads men to complete fatalism (as it  generally does), it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense  a liberating force.  It is absurd to say that you are especially  advancing freedom when you only use free thought to destroy free will.  The determinists come to bind, not to loose.  They may well call  their law the \"chain\" of causation.  It is the worst chain that ever  fettered a human being.  You may use the language of liberty,  if you like, about materialistic teaching, but it is obvious that this  is just as inapplicable to it as a whole as the same language when  applied to a man locked up in a mad-house. You may say, if you like,  that the man is free to think himself a poached egg.  But it is  surely a more massive and"]]]
