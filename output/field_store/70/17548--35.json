[_Chase the shooting stars_. l. 115. The meteors called shooting stars,  the lightening, the rainbow, and the clouds, are phenomena of the lower  regions of the atmosphere. The twilight, the meteors call'd fire-balls,  or flying dragons, and the northern lights, inhabit the higher regions  of the atmosphere.

Mr. Cavendish has shewn that the gas  called inflammable air, is at least ten times lighter than common air;  Mr. Lavoisier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water,  and is by him called hydrogene. It is supposed to afford their principal  nourishment to vegetables and thence to animals, and is perpetually  rising from their decomposition; this source of it in hot climates, and  in summer months, is so great as to exceed estimation. Now if this light  gas passes through the atmosphere, without combining with it, it must  compose another atmosphere over the aerial one; which must expand, when  the pressure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.    If this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aerial one,  like ether upon water, what must happen? 1. it will flow from the line,  where it will be produced in the greatest quantities, and become much  accumulated over the poles of the earth; 2. the common air, or lower  stratum of the atmosphere, will be much thinner over the poles than at  the line; because if a glass globe be filled with oil and water, and  whirled upon its axis, the centrifugal power will carry the heavier  fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will in consequence be found  round the axis. 3. There may be a place at some certain latitude between  the poles and the line on each side the equator, where the inflammable  supernatant atmosphere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force  of the heavier aerial atmosphere. 4. Between the termination of the  aerial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere, the airs will  occasionally be intermixed, and thus become inflammable by the electric  spark; these circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of  fire-balls, northern lights, and of some variable winds, and long  continued rains.    Since the above note was first written, Mr. Volta I am informed has  applied the supposition of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air,  to explain some phenomena in meteorology. And Mr. Lavoisier has  announced his design to write on this subject. Traite de Chimie, Tom. I.  I am happy to find these opinions supported by such respectable  authority.]    [_And bend the twilight_. l. 126. The crepuscular atmosphere, or the  region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us, is  estimated by philosophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which  time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of  the air is supposed to be from 4,000 to 10,000 times greater than at the  surface of the earth. Cotes's Hydrost. p. 123. The duration of twilight  differs in different seasons and in different latitudes; in England the  shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in  more northern latitudes, where the sun never sinks more than 18 degrees,  below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night. The time of  its duration may also be occasionally affected by the varying height of  the atmosphere. A number of observations on the duration of twilight in  different latitudes might afford considerable information concerning the  aerial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and might assist  in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflammable gas, or  Hydrogene, exists over the aerial one.]    [_Alarm with Comet-blaze_. l. 133.

Many philosophers have believed that  the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid mass of burning lava,  which they have called a subterraneous sun; and have supposed, that it  contributes to the production of metals, and to the growth of  vegetables.

[_Hurl innocuous embers_. l. 152. The immediate cause of volcanic  eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the sea, or from  lakes, or inundations, finding itself a passage into the subterraneous  fires, which may lie at great depths. This must first produce by its  coldness a condensation of the vapour there existing, or a vacuum, and  thus occasion parts of the earth's crust or shell to be forced down by  the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere. Afterwards the water being  suddenly raised into steam produces all the explosive effects of  earthquakes. And by new accessions of water during the intervals of the  explosions the repetition of the shocks is caused. These circumstances  were hourly illustrated by the fountains of boiling water in Iceland, in  which the surface of the water in the boiling wells sunk down low before  every new ebullition.    Besides these eruptions occasioned by the steam of water, there seems to  be a perpetual effusion of other vapours, more noxious and (as far as it  is yet known) perhaps greatly more expansile than water from the  Volcanos in various parts of the world. As these Volcanos are supposed  to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires, it  is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause,  that the earthquakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to  those of antient times, of which vestiges remain in every part of the  world, and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous, but  useful.]             \"Thus when of old, as mystic bards presume,       Huge CYCLOPS dwelt in Etna's rocky womb,       On thundering anvils rung their loud alarms,  160  And leagued with VULCAN forged immortal arms;       Descending VENUS sought the dark abode,       And sooth'd the labours of the grisly God.--       While frowning Loves the threatening falchion wield,       And tittering Graces peep behind the shield,  165  With jointed mail their fairy limbs o'erwhelm,       Or nod with pausing step the plumed helm;       With radiant eye She view'd the boiling ore,       Heard undismay'd the breathing bellows roar,       Admired their sinewy arms, and shoulders bare,  170  And ponderous hammers lifted high in air,       With smiles celestial bless'd their dazzled sight,       And Beauty blazed amid infernal night.

Stew it till the meat is done to  rags, and skim it well. Then strain it and return it to the pot.    Blanch and pound in a mortar to a smooth paste, a quarter of a  pound of sweet almonds, and mix them with the yolks of six hard  boiled eggs grated, mid a pint of cream, which must first have  been boiled or it will curdle in the soup. Season it with nutmeg  and mace. Stir the mixture into the soup, and let it boil  afterward about three minutes, stirring all the time. Lay in the  bottom of the tureen some slices of bread without the crust. Pour  the soup upon it, and send it to table.      CLEAR GRAVY SOUP.    Having well buttered the inside of a nicely tinned stew-pot, cut  half a pound of ham into slices, and lay them at the bottom, with  three pounds of the lean of fresh beef, and as much veal, cut from  the bones, which you must afterward break to pieces, and lay on  the meat. Cover the pan closely, and set it over a quick fire.  When the meat begins to stick to the pan, turn it; and when there  is a nice brown glaze at the bottom, cover the meat with cold  water. Watch it well, and when it is just coming to a boil, put in  half a pint of cold water. This will cause the scum to rise. Skim  it well, and then pour in another half pint of cold water; skim it  again; pour in cold water as before, half a pint at a time, and  repeat this till no more scum rises. In skimming, carefully avoid  stirring the soup, as that will injure its clearness.    In the mean time prepare your vegetables. Peel off the outer skin  of three large white onions and slice them. Pare three large  turnips, and slice them also. Wash clean and cut into small pieces  three carrots, and three large heads of celery. If you cannot  obtain fresh celery, substitute a large table-spoonful of celery  seed, tied up in a bit of clear muslin. Put the vegetables into  the soup, and then place the pot on one side of the fire, where  the heat is not so great as in the middle. Let it boil gently for  four hours. Then strain the soup through a fine towel or linen bag  into a large stone pan, but do not squeeze the bag, or the soup  will be cloudy, and look dull instead of clear. In pouring it into  the straining cloth, be careful not to disturb the ingredients at  the bottom of the soup-pot.    This soup should be of a fine clear amber colour. If not perfectly  bright after straining, you may clarify it in this manner. Put it  into the stew-pan. Break the whites of two eggs into a basin,  carefully avoiding the smallest particle of the yolk. Beat the  white of egg to a stiff froth, and then mix it gradually with the  soup. Set it over the fire, and stir it till it boils briskly.  Then take it off, and set it beside the fire to settle for ten  minutes. Strain it then through a clean napkin, and it will be fit  for use. But it is better to have the soup clear by making it  carefully, than to depend on clarifying it afterward, as the white  of egg weakens the taste.    In making this (which is quite a show-soup) it is customary to  reverse the general rule, and pour in cold water.      SOUPE A LA JULIENNE.    Make a gravy soup as in the preceding receipt, and strain it  before you put in the vegetables. Cut some turnips and carrots  into ribands, and some onions and celery into lozenges or long  diamond-shaped pieces. Boil them separately. When the vegetables  are thoroughly boiled, put them with the soup into the tureen, and  then lay gently on the top some small squares of toasted bread  without crust; taking care that they do not crumble down and  disturb the brightness of the soup, which should be of a clear  amber colour.      MACCARONI SOUP.    This also is made of clear gravy soup. Cut up and boil the  maccaroni by itself in a very little water, allowing a quarter of  a pound to a quart of soup. The pieces should be about an inch  long. Put a small piece of butter with it. It must boil till  tender, but not till it breaks. Throw it into the soup shortly  before it goes to table, and give it one boil up. Send to table  with it a plate or glass of rasped Parmesan or other rich cheese,  with a dessert spoon in it, that those who like it may put it into  their soup on the plate.    While the maccaroni is boiling, take care that it does not get  into lumps.      RICH MACCARONI SOUP.    Take a quart of clear gravy soup, and boil in it a pound of the  best maccaroni cut into pieces. When it is tender, take out half  of the maccaroni, and add to the remainder two quarts more of the  soup. Boil it till the maccaroni is entirely dissolved and  incorporated with the liquid. Strain it; then return it to the  soup-pan, and add to it the remainder of the maccaroni, (that was  taken out before the pieces broke,) and put in a quarter of a  pound of grated Parmesan cheese. Let it simmer awhile, but take it  up before it comes to a boil.    It may be made with milk instead of gravy soup.      VERMICELLI SOUP.    Cut a knuckle of veal, or a neck of mutton into small pieces, and  put them, with the bones broken up, into a large stew-pan. Add the  meat sliced from a hock or shank of ham, a quarter of a pound of  butter, two large onions sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a  head of celery cut small. Cover the pan closely, and set it  without any water over a slow fire for an hour or more, to extract  the essence from the meat. Then skim it well, and pour in four  quarts of boiling water, and let it boil gently till all the meat  is reduced to rags. Strain it, set it again on the fire, and add a  quarter of a pound of vermicelli, which has first been scalded in  boiling water. Season it to your taste with salt and cayenne  pepper, and let it boil five minutes. Lay a large slice of bread  in the bottom of your tureen, and pour the soup upon it.    For the veal or mutton you may substitute a pair of large fowls  cut into pieces; always adding the ham or a few slices of bacon,  without which it will be insipid. Old fowls that are fit for no  other purpose will do very well for soup.      MILK SOUP.    Boil two quarts of milk with a quarter of a pound of sweet  almonds, and two ounces of bitter ones, blanched and broken to  pieces, and a large stick of cinnamon broken up. Stir in sugar  enough to make it very sweet. When it has boiled strain it. Cut  some thin slices of bread, and (having pared off the crust) toast  them. Lay them in the bottom of a tureen, pour a little of the hot  milk over them, and cover them close, that they may soak. Beat the  yolks of five eggs very light Set the milk on hot coals, and add  the eggs to it by degrees; stirring it all the time till it  thickens. Then take it off instantly, lest it curdle, and pour it  into the tureen, boiling hot, over the bread.    This will be still better if you cover the bottom with slices of  baked apple.      RICH BROWN SOUP.    Take six pounds of the lean of fresh beef, cut from the bone.  Stick it over with four dozen cloves. Season it with a tea-spoonful  of salt, a tea-spoonful of pepper, a tea-spoonful of  mace, and a beaten nutmeg. Slice half a dozen onions; fry them in  butter; chop them, and spread them over the meat after you have  put it into the soup-pot. Pour in five quarts of water, and stew  it slowly for five or six hours; skimming it well. When the meat  has dissolved into shreds, strain it, and return the liquid to the  pot. Then add a tumbler and a half, or six wine glasses of claret  or port wine. Simmer it again slowly till dinner time. When the  soup is reduced to three quarts, it is done enough. Put it into a  tureen, and send it to table.      RICH WHITE SOUP.    Take a pair of large fat fowls. Cut them up. Butter the inside of  the soup-pot, and put in the pieces of fowl with two pounds of the  lean of veal, cut into pieces, or with four calf's feet cut in  half. Season them with a tea-spoonful of salt, a half tea-spoonful  of cayenne pepper, and a dozen blades of mace. Cover them with  water, and stew it slowly for an hour, skimming it well. Then take  out the breasts and wings of the fowls, and having cut off the  flesh, chop it fine. Keep the pot covered, and the veal and the  remainder of the fowls still stewing.    Mix the chopped chicken with the grated crumb of about one quarter  of a loaf of stale bread, (a six cent loaf,) having soaked the  crumbs in a little warm milk. Have ready the yolks of four hard  boiled eggs, a dozen sweet almonds, and half a dozen bitter ones  blanched and broken small. Mix the egg and almonds with the  chopped chicken and grated bread, and pound all in a mortar till  it is well incorporated. Strain the soup from the meat and fowl,  and stir this mixture into the liquid, after it has stewed till  reduced to two quarts. Having boiled separately a quart of cream  or rich milk, add it hot to the soup, a little at a time. Cover  it, and let it simmer a few minutes longer. Then send it to table.    These two soups (the brown and the white) are suited to dinner  parties.      MEG MERRILIES' SOUP.    Take four pounds of venison, or if you cannot procure venison you  may substitute the lean of fresh beef or mutton. Season it with  pepper and salt, put it into a large pot, (break the bones and lay  them on the meat,) pour in four quarts of water, and boil it three  hours, skimming it well. Then strain it, and put it into another  pot.    Cut up a hare or a rabbit, a pair of partridges, and a pair of  grouse; or one of each, with a pheasant, a woodcock, or any other  game that you can most easily obtain. Season them and put them  into the soup. Add a dozen small onions, a couple of heads of  celery cut small, and half a dozen sliced potatoes. Let the soup  simmer till the game is sufficiently done, and all the vegetables  tender.    This is the soup with which the gipsy, Meg Merrilies, regaled  Dominie Sampson.    When game is used for soup, it must be newly killed, and quite  fresh.      VENISON SOUP.    Take four pounds of freshly killed venison cut off"]]]
