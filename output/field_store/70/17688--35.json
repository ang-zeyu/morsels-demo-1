Just keep going, and the  machine will carry you beyond your expectations.    The Professor knew nothing about machinery and less about an  automobile, but where ignorance is bliss it is double-distilled  folly to know anything about the eccentricities of an automobile.    To enjoy automobiling, one must know either all or nothing about  the machine,--a little knowledge is a dangerous thing; on the part  of the guest it leads to all sorts of apprehensions, on the part  of the chauffeur to all sorts of experiments. About five hundred  miles is the limit of a man's ignorance; he then knows enough to  make trouble; at the end of another five hundred he is of  assistance, at the end of the third he will run the machine  himself--your greatest pleasure is in the first five hundred. With  some precocious individuals these figures may be reduced somewhat.    The Professor adjusted his spectacles and looked at the machine:    \"A very wonderful contrivance, and one that requires some skill to  operate. From lack of experience, I cannot hope to be of much  practical assistance at first, but possibly a theoretical  knowledge of the laws and principles governing things mechanical  may be of service in an emergency. Since receiving your telegram,  I have brushed up a little my knowledge of both kinematics and  dynamics, though it is quite apparent that the operation of these  machines, accompanied, as it is said, by many restraints and  perturbations, falls under the latter branch. In view of the  possibility--remote, I trust--of the machine refusing to go, I  have devoted a little time to statics, and therefore feel that I  shall be something more than a supercargo.\"    \"Well, you _are_ equipped, Professor; no doubt your knowledge will  prove useful.\"    \"Knowledge is always useful if people in this busy age would only  pause to make use of it. Mechanics has been defined as the  application of pure mathematics to produce or modify motion in  inferior bodies; what could be more apt? Is it not our intention  to produce or modify motion in this inferior body before us?\"    Days after the Professor found the crank a more useful implement  for the inducing of motion.    It was Thursday morning, August 1, at exactly seven o'clock, that  we passed south on Michigan Avenue towards South Chicago and  Hammond. A glorious morning, neither hot nor cold, but just  deliciously cool, with some promise--afterwards more than  fulfilled--of a warm day.    The hour was early, policemen few, streets clear, hence fast speed  could be made.    As we passed Zion Temple, near Twelfth Street, the home of the  Dowieites, the Professor said:    \"A very remarkable man, that Dowie.\"    \"A fraud and an impostor,\" I retorted, reflecting current opinion.  \"Possibly; but we all impose more or less upon one another; he has  simply made a business of his imposition. Did you ever meet him?\"    \"No; it's hardly worth while.\"    \"It is worth while to meet any man who influences or controls a  considerable body of his fellow-men. The difference between  Mohammed and Joseph Smith is of degree rather than kind. Dowie is  down towards the small end of the scale, but he is none the less  there, and differs in kind from your average citizen in his power  to influence and control others. I crossed the lake with him one  night and spent the evening in conversation.\"    \"What are your impressions of the man?\"    \"A shrewd, hard-headed, dogmatic Scotchman,--who neither smokes  nor drinks.\"    \"Who calls himself Elijah come to earth again.\"    \"I had the temerity to ask him concerning his pretensions in that  direction, and he said, substantially, 'I make no claims or  assertions, but the Bible says Elijah will return to earth; it  does not say in what form or how he will manifest himself; he  might choose your personality; he might choose mine; he has not  chosen yours, there are some evidences that he has chosen mine.\"    \"Proof most conclusive.\"    \"It satisfies his followers. After all, perhaps it does not matter  so much what we believe as how we believe.\"    A few moments later we were passing the new Christian Science  Temple on Drexel Boulevard,--a building quite simple and  delightful, barring some garish lamps in front.    \"There is another latter-day sect,\" said the Professor; \"one of  the phenomena of the nineteenth century.\"    \"You would not class them with the Dowieites?\"    \"By no means, but an interesting part of a large whole which  embraces at one extreme the Dowieites. The connecting link is  faith. But the very architecture of the temple we have just passed  illustrates the vast interval that separates the two.\"    \"Then you judge a sect by its buildings?\"    \"Every faith has its own architecture. The temple at Karnak and  the tabernacle at Salt Lake City are petrifactions of faith. In  time the places of worship are the only tangible remains--witness  Stonehenge.\"    Chicago boasts the things she has not and slights the things she  has; she talks of everything but the lake and her broad and almost  endless boulevards, yet these are her chief glories.    For miles and miles and miles one can travel boulevards upon which  no traffic teams are allowed. From Fort Sheridan, twenty-five  miles north, to far below Jackson Park to the south there is an  unbroken stretch. Some day Sheridan Road will extend to Milwaukee,  ninety miles from Chicago.    One may reach Jackson Park, the old World's Fair site, by three  fine boulevards,--Michigan, broad and straight; Drexel, with its  double driveways and banks of flowers, trees, and shrubbery  between; Grand, with its three driveways, and so wide one cannot  recognize an acquaintance on the far side, cannot even see the  policeman frantically motioning to slow down.     It does not matter which route is taken to the Park, the good  roads end there. We missed our way, and went eighteen miles to  Hammond, over miles of poor pavement and unfinished roads. That  was a pull which tried nerves and temper,--to find at the end  there was another route which involved but a short distance of  poor going. It is all being improved, and soon there will be a  good road to Hammond.    Through Indiana from Hammond to Hobart the road is macadamized and  in perfect condition; we reached Hobart at half-past nine; no stop  was made. At Crocker two pails of water were added to the cooling  tank.    At Porter the road was lost for a second time,--exasperating. At  Chesterton four gallons of gasoline were taken and a quick run  made to Burdick.    The roads are now not so good,--not bad, but just good country  roads, some stretches of gravel, but generally clay, with some  sand here and there. The country is rolling, but no steep hills.    Up to this time the machine had required no attention, but just  beyond Otis, while stopping to inquire the way, we discovered a  rusty round nail embedded to the head in the right rear tire. The  tire showed no signs of deflation, but on drawing the nail the air  followed, showing a puncture. As the nail was scarcely  three-quarters of an inch long,--not long enough to go clear through  and injure the inner coating on the opposite side,--it was entirely  practical to reinsert and run until it worked out. A very fair  temporary repair might have been made by first dipping the nail in a  tire cement, but the nail was rusty and stuck very well.    An hour later, at La Porte, the nail was still doing good service  and no leak could be detected. We wired back to Chicago to have an  extra tire sent on ahead.    From Chicago to La Porte, by way of Hobart, the roads are  excellent, excepting always the few miles near South Chicago. Keep  to the south--even as far south as Valparaiso--rather than to the  north, near the lake. The roads are hilly and sandy near the lake.    Beware the so-called road map; it is a snare and a delusion. A  road which seems most seductive on the bicycler's road map may be  a sea of sand or a veritable quagmire, but with a fine bicycle  path at the side. As you get farther east these cinder paths are  protected by law, with heavy fines for driving thereon; it  requires no little restraint to plough miles and miles through  bottomless mud on a narrow road in the Mohawk valley with a superb  three-foot cinder path against your very wheels. The machine of  its own accord will climb up now and then; it requires all the  vigilance of a law-abiding driver to keep it in the mud, where it  is so unwilling to travel.    So far as finding and keeping the road is concerned,--and it is a  matter of great concern in this vast country, where roads,  cross-roads, forks, and all sorts of snares and delusions abound  without sign-boards to point the way,--the following directions may  be given once for all:    If the proposed route is covered by any automobile hand-book or  any automobile publication, get it, carry it with you and be  guided by it; all advice of ancient inhabitants to the contrary  notwithstanding.    If there is no publication covering the route, take pains to get  from local automobile sources information about the several  possible routes to the principal towns which you wish to make.    If you can get no information at all from automobile sources, you  can make use--with great caution--of bicycle road maps, of the  maps rather than the redlined routes.    About the safest course is to spread out the map and run a  straight line between the principal points on the proposed route,  note the larger villages, towns, and cities near the line so  drawn, make a list of them in the order they come from the  starting-point, and simply inquire at each of these points for the  best road to the next.    If the list includes places of fair size,--say, from one to ten or  twenty thousand inhabitants, it is reasonably certain that the  roads connecting such places will be about as good as there are in  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],[0,"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#4)"],[1,"heaven for the winter-victory.    But others were who wakeful laid    In midnight beds, and early rose,    And, feverish in the foggy snows,  Snatched the damp paper--wife and maid.    The death-list like a river flows      Down the pale sheet,  And there the whelming waters meet.      Ah God! may Time with happy haste    Bring wail and triumph to a waste,      And war be done;    The battle flag-staff fall athwart    The curs'd ravine, and wither; naught      Be left of trench or gun;    The bastion, let it ebb away,    Washed with the river bed; and Day      In vain seek Donelson.        The Cumberland.  (March, 1862.)      Some names there are of telling sound,    Whose voweled syllables free  Are pledge that they shall ever live renowned;        Such seem to be  A Frigate's name (by present glory spanned)--        The Cumberland.                Sounding name as ere was sung,              Flowing, rolling on the tongue--              Cumberland! Cumberland!    She warred and sunk. There's no denying    That she was ended--quelled;  And yet her flag above her fate is flying,        As when it swelled  Unswallowed by the swallowing sea: so grand--        The Cumberland.                Goodly name as ere was sung,              Roundly rolling on the tongue--              Cumberland! Cumberland!    What need to tell how she was fought--    The sinking flaming gun--  The gunner leaping out the port--        Washed back, undone!  Her dead unconquerably manned        The Cumberland.                Noble name as ere was sung,              Slowly roll it on the tongue--              Cumberland! Cumberland!    Long as hearts shall share the flame    Which burned in that brave crew,  Her fame shall live--outlive the victor's name;        For this is due.  Your flag and flag-staff shall in story stand--        Cumberland!                Sounding name as ere was sung,              Long they'll roll it on the tongue--              Cumberland! Cumberland!        In the Turret.  (March, 1862.)      Your honest heart of duty, Worden,    So helped you that in fame you dwell;  You bore the first iron battle's burden    Sealed as in a diving-bell.  Alcides, groping into haunted hell  To bring forth King Admetus' bride,  Braved naught more vaguely direful and untried.    What poet shall uplift his charm,  Bold Sailor, to your height of daring,    And interblend therewith the calm,  And build a goodly style upon your bearing.    Escaped the gale of outer ocean--    Cribbed in a craft which like a log  Was washed by every billow's motion--    By night you heard of Og  The huge; nor felt your courage clog  At tokens of his onset grim:  You marked the sunk ship's flag-staff slim,    Lit by her burning sister's heart;  You marked, and mused: \"Day brings the trial:    Then be it proved if I have part  With men whose manhood never took denial.\"    A prayer went up--a champion's. Morning    Beheld you in the Turret walled  by adamant, where a spirit forewarning    And all-deriding called:  \"Man, darest thou--desperate, unappalled--  Be first to lock thee in the armored tower?  I have thee now; and what the battle-hour    To me shall bring--heed well--thou'lt share;  This plot-work, planned to be the foeman's terror,    To thee may prove a goblin-snare;  Its very strength and cunning--monstrous error!\"    \"Stand up, my heart; be strong; what matter    If here thou seest thy welded tomb?  And let huge Og with thunders batter--    Duty be still my doom,  Though drowning come in liquid gloom;  First duty, duty next, and duty last;  Ay, Turret, rivet me here to duty fast!--\"    So nerved, you fought wisely and well;  And live, twice live in life and story;    But over your Monitor dirges swell,  In wind and wave that keep the rites of glory.        The Temeraire.[3]    _(Supposed to have been suggested to an Englishman of the old order by  the fight of the Monitor and Merrimac.)_      The gloomy hulls, in armor grim,    Like clouds o'er moors have met,  And prove that oak, and iron, and man    Are tough in fibre yet.    But Splendors wane. The sea-fight yields    No front of old display;  The garniture, emblazonment,    And heraldry all decay.    Towering afar in parting light,    The fleets like Albion's forelands shine--  The full-sailed fleets, the shrouded show    Of Ships-of-the-Line.    The fighting Temeraire,    Built of a thousand trees,  Lunging out her lightnings,    And beetling o'er the seas--  O Ship, how brave and fair,    That fought so oft and well,  On open decks you manned the gun      Armorial.[4]  What cheering did you share,    Impulsive in the van,  When down upon leagued France and Spain    We English ran--  The freshet at your bowsprit    Like the foam upon the can.  Bickering, your colors    Licked up the Spanish air,  You flapped with flames of battle-flags--    Your challenge, Temeraire!  The rear ones of our fleet    They yearned to share your place,  Still vying with the Victory    Throughout that earnest race--  The Victory, whose Admiral,    With orders nobly won,  Shone in the globe of the battle glow--    The angel in that sun.  Parallel in story,    Lo, the stately pair,  As late in grapple ranging,    The foe between them there--  When four great hulls lay tiered,    And the fiery tempest cleared,  And your prizes twain appeared,      Temeraire!    But Trafalgar' is over now,    The quarter-deck undone;  The carved and castled navies fire    Their evening-gun.  O, Tital Temeraire,    Your stern-lights fade away;  Your bulwarks to the years must yield,    And heart-of-oak decay.  A pigmy steam-tug tows you,    Gigantic, to the shore--  Dismantled of your guns and spars,    And sweeping wings of war.  The rivets clinch the iron-clads,    Men learn a deadlier lore;  But Fame has nailed your battle-flags--    Your ghost it sails before:  O, the navies old and oaken,    O, the Temeraire no more!        A Utilitarian View of the Monitors Fight.      Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse,    More ponderous than nimble;  For since grimed War here laid aside  His Orient pomp, 'twould ill befit      Overmuch to ply  The Rhyme's barbaric cymbal.    Hail to victory without the gaud    Of glory; zeal that needs no fans  Of banners; plain mechanic power  Plied cogently in War now placed--      Where War belongs--  Among the trades and artisans.    Yet this was battle, and intense--    Beyond the strife of fleets heroic;  Deadlier, closer, calm 'mid storm;  No passion; all went on by crank,      Pivot, and screw,  And calculations of caloric.    Needless to dwell; the story's known.    the ringing of those plates on plates  Still ringeth round the world--  The clangor of that blacksmith's fray.      The anvil-din  Resounds this message from the Fates:    War shall yet be, and to the end;    But war-paint shows the streaks of weather;  War yet shall be, but warriors  Are now but operatives; War's made      Less grand than Peace,  And a singe runs through lace and feather.        Shiloh.  A Requiem.  (April, 1862.)      Skimming lightly, wheeling still,    The swallows fly low  Over the field in clouded days,    The forest-field of Shiloh--  Over the field where April rain  Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain  Through the pause of night  That followed the Sunday fight    Around the church of Shiloh--  The church so lone, the log-built one,  That echoed to many a parting groan      And natural prayer  Of dying foemen mingled there--  Foemen at morn, but friends at eve--    Fame or country least their care:  (What like a bullet can undeceive!)    But now they lie low,  While over them the swallows skim,    And all is hushed at Shiloh.        The Battle for the Mississipppi.  (April, 1862.)      When Israel camped by Migdol hoar,    Down at her feet her shawm she threw,  But Moses sung and timbrels rung    For Pharaoh's standed crew.  So God appears in apt events--    The Lord is a man of war!  So the strong wind to the muse is given        In victory's roar.    Deep be the ode that hymns the fleet--    The fight by night--the fray  Which bore our Flag against the powerful stream,    And led it up to day.  Dully through din of larger strife    Shall bay that warring gun;  But none the less to us who live    It peals--an echoing one.    The shock of ships, the jar of walls,    The rush through thick and thin--  The flaring fire-rafts, glare and gloom--    Eddies, and shells that spin--  The boom-chain burst, the hulks dislodged,    The jam of gun-boats driven,  Or fired, or sunk--made up a war    Like Michael's waged with leven.    The manned Varuna stemmed and quelled    The odds which hard beset;  The oaken flag-ship, half ablaze,    Passed on and thundered yet;  While foundering, gloomed in grimy flame,    The Ram Manassas--hark the yell!--  Plunged, and was gone; in joy or fright,    The River gave a startled swell.    They fought through lurid dark till dawn;    The war-smoke rolled away  With clouds of night, and showed the fleet    In scarred yet firm array,  Above the forts, above the drift    Of wrecks which strife had made;  And Farragut sailed up to the town    And anchored--sheathed the blade.    The moody broadsides, brooding deep,    Hold the lewd mob at bay,  While o'er the armed decks' solemn aisles    The meek church-pennons play;  By shotted guns the sailors stand,    With foreheads bound or bare;  The captains and the conquering crews    Humble their pride in prayer.    They pray; and after victory, prayer    Is meet for men who mourn their slain;  The living shall unmoor and sail,    But Death's dark anchor secret deeps detain.  Yet glory slants her shaft of rays    Far through the undisturbed abyss;  There must be other, nobler worlds for them    Who nobly yield their lives in this.        Malvern Hill.  (July, 1862.)      Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill    In prime of morn and May,  Recall ye how McClellan's men      Here stood at bay?  While deep within yon forest dim    Our rigid comrades "]]]
