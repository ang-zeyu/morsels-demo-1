[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10986"],[0,"Frederick Douglass (#4)"],[1,"d, a  Mr. Nathan Johnson, a colored man to whom he had been recommended,  received him kindly, gave him shelter and sympathy, and lent him a  small sum of money to redeem his meagre baggage, which had been held  by the stage-driver as security for an unpaid balance of the fare to  New Bedford. In his autobiography Douglass commends Mr. Johnson for  his \"noble-hearted hospitality and manly character.\"    In New York Douglass had changed his name in order the better to hide  his identity from any possible pursuer. Douglass's name was another  tie that bound him to his race. He has been called \"Douglass\" by the  writer because that was the name he took for himself, as he did his  education and his freedom; and as \"Douglass\" he made himself famous.  As a slave, he was legally entitled to but one name,--Frederick. From  his grandfather, Isaac Bailey, a freeman, he had derived the surname  Bailey. His mother, with unconscious sarcasm, had called the little  slave boy Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. The bearer of this  imposing string of appellations had, with a finer sense of fitness,  cut it down to Frederick Bailey. In New York he had called himself  Frederick Johnson; but, finding when he reached New Bedford that a  considerable portion of the colored population of the city already  rejoiced in this familiar designation, he fell in with the suggestion  of his host, who had been reading Scott's _Lady of the Lake_,  and traced an analogy between the runaway slave and the fugitive  chieftain, that the new freeman should call himself Douglass,  after the noble Scot of that name [Douglas]. The choice proved not  inappropriate, for this modern Douglass fought as valiantly in his own  cause and with his own weapons as ever any Douglass [Douglas] fought  with flashing steel in border foray.    Here, then, in a New England town, Douglass began the life of a  freeman, from which, relieved now of the incubus of slavery, he soon  emerged into the career for which, in the providence of God, he seemed  by his multiform experience to have been especially fitted. He did not  find himself, even in Massachusetts, quite beyond the influence of  slavery. While before the law of the State he was the equal of any  other man, caste prejudice prevented him from finding work at his  trade of calker; and he therefore sought employment as a laborer. This  he found easily, and for three years worked at whatever his hands  found to do. The hardest toil was easy to him, the heaviest burdens  were light; for the money that he earned went into his own pocket.  If it did not remain there long, he at least had the satisfaction of  spending it and of enjoying what it purchased.    During these three years he was learning the lesson of liberty and  unconsciously continuing his training for the work of an anti-slavery  agitator. He became a subscriber to the _Liberator_, each number of  which he devoured with eagerness. He heard William Lloyd Garrison  lecture, and became one of his most devoted disciples. He attended  every anti-slavery meeting in New Bedford, and now and then spoke on  the subject of slavery in humble gatherings of his own people.          IV      In 1841 Douglass entered upon that epoch of his life which brought the  hitherto obscure refugee prominently before the public, and in which  his services as anti-slavery orator and reformer constitute his chief  claim to enduring recollection. Millions of negroes whose lives had  been far less bright than Douglass's had lived and died in slavery.  Thousands of fugitives under assumed names were winning a precarious  livelihood in the free States and trembling in constant fear of the  slave-catcher. Some of these were doing noble work in assisting others  to escape from bondage. Mr. Siebert, in his _Underground Railroad_,  mentions one fugitive slave, John Mason by name, who assisted thirteen  hundred others to escape from Kentucky. Another picturesque fugitive  was Harriet Tubman, who devoted her life to this work with a courage,  skill, and success that won her a wide reputation among the friends  of freedom. A number of free colored men in the North, a few of them  wealthy and cultivated, lent their time and their means to this cause.  But it was reserved for Douglass, by virtue of his marvellous gift of  oratory, to become pre-eminently the personal representative of his  people for a generation.    In 1841 the Massachusetts Anti-slavery Society, which had been for  some little time weakened by faction, arranged its differences, and  entered upon a campaign of unusual activity, which found expression in  numerous meetings throughout the free States, mainly in New  England. On August 15 of that year a meeting was held at Nantucket,  Massachusetts. The meeting was conducted by John A. Collins, at that  time general agent of the society, and was addressed by William Lloyd  Garrison and other leading abolitionists. Douglass had taken a holiday  and come from New Bedford to attend this convention, without the  remotest thought of taking part except as a spectator. The proceedings  were interesting, and aroused the audience to a high state of feeling.  There was present in the meeting a certain abolitionist, by name  William C. Coffin, who had heard Douglass speak in the little negro  Sunday-school at New Bedford, and who knew of his recent escape from  slavery. To him came the happy inspiration to ask Douglass to speak  a few words to the convention by way of personal testimony. Collins  introduced the speaker as \"a graduate from slavery, with his diploma  written upon his back.\"    Douglass himself speaks very modestly about this, his first public  appearance. He seems, from his own account, to have suffered somewhat  from stage fright, which was apparently his chief memory concerning  it. The impressions of others, however, allowing a little for the  enthusiasm of the moment, are a safer guide as to the effect of  Douglass's first speech. Parker Pillsbury reported that, \"though it  was late in the evening when the young man closed his remarks, none  seemed to know or care for the hour.... The crowded congregation had  been wrought up almost to enchantment during the whole long evening,  particularly by some of the utterances of the last speaker [Douglass],  as he turned over the terrible apocalypse of his experience in  slavery.\" Mr. Garrison bore testimony to \"the extraordinary emotion it  exerted on his own mind and to the powerful impression it exerted upon  a crowded auditory.\" \"Patrick Henry,\" he declared, \"had never made a  more eloquent speech than the one they had just listened to from the  lips of the hunted fugitive.\" Upon Douglass and his speech as a text  Mr. Garrison delivered one of the sublimest and most masterly efforts  of his life; and then and there began the friendship between the  fugitive slave and the great agitator which opened the door  for Douglass to a life of noble usefulness, and secured to the  anti-slavery cause one of its most brilliant and effective orators.    At Garrison's instance Collins offered Douglass employment as lecturer  for the Anti-slavery Society, though the idea of thus engaging him  doubtless occurred to more than one of the abolition leaders who heard  his Nantucket speech. Douglass was distrustful of his own powers. Only  three years out of slavery, with little learning and no experience  as a public speaker, painfully aware of the prejudice which must be  encountered by men of his color, fearful too of the publicity that  might reveal his whereabouts to his legal owner, who might reclaim his  property wherever found, he yielded only reluctantly to Mr. Collins's  proposition, and agreed at first upon only a three months' term of  service.    Most of the abolitionists were, or meant to be, consistent in their  practice of what they preached; and so, when Douglass was enrolled as  one of the little band of apostles, they treated him literally as a  man and a brother. Their homes, their hearts, and their often none too  well-filled purses were open to him. In this new atmosphere his mind  expanded, his spirit took on high courage, and he read and studied  diligently, that he might make himself worthy of his opportunity to do  something for his people.    During the remainder of 1841 Douglass travelled and lectured in  Eastern Massachusetts with George Foster, in the interest of the  two leading abolition journals, the _Anti-slavery Standard_ and the  _Liberator_, and also lectured in Rhode Island against the proposed  Dorr constitution, which sought to limit the right of suffrage to  white male citizens only, thus disfranchising colored men who had  theretofore voted. With Foster and Pillsbury and Parker[1] and  Monroe[2] and Abby Kelly [Kelley][3] he labored to defeat the Dorr  constitution and at the same time promote the abolition gospel. The  proposed constitution was defeated, and colored men who could meet the  Rhode Island property qualification were left in possession of the  right to vote.    [Footnote 1: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: Reverend Theodore Parker  (1810-1860) was a Unitarian minister who graduated from the Harvard  Divinity School and was active in the Boston area.]    [Footnote 2: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: James Monroe (1821-1898),  a New Englander with a Quaker mother; in 1839 he became an  Abolitionist lecturer instead of enrolling in college.]    [Footnote 3: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: Abigail Kelley Foster  (1811-1887), who married another Abolitionist, Stephen Foster, in  1845, was a Quaker orator and organizer on behalf of the abolition of  slavery and for women's right to vote.]    Douglass had plunged into this new work, after the first embarrassment  wore off, with all the enthusiasm of youth and hope. But, except among  the little band of Garrisonians and their sympathizers, his position  did not relieve him from the disabilities attaching to his color.

And this not at all on  philosophical grounds, but because its aims were entirely practical. For  the aim of its founder was to show men how by a virtuous life, or lives,  they might at last attain annihilation--or, at any rate, the extinction  of the individual self, the apparent separateness of which was, in his  view, the source of all misery. And if he could teach his followers to  attain that salvation, he was entirely indifferent as to the opinions  they might hold about the ultimate nature of the world, provided only  that they did not fall into any heresy which proclaimed an immortal  soul.[8]    [Sidenote: Persian Religions, not strictly Pantheistic.]    [Sidenote: A World Drama or Process is a Human, not a Divine Aspect of  Things.]    The accounts given to us by the best authorities on Zoroaster and  Parseeism scarcely justify us in thinking the religion of the Zendavesta  to be Pantheistic in our sense of the term. For though it would appear  that Ormuzd (or Ahuramazda), the God of light and goodness, originated  in, or was born from and one with a nameless impersonal Unity, such as  may answer to Herbert Spencer's \"Unknowable,\" it cannot be accurately  said that, according to the Persian view of the world, there is nothing  but God. For, to say nothing of the apparently independent existence of  the principle of darkness and evil called Ahriman, the relation of the  Amshaspands, or supreme spirits, and of the Izeds, or secondary spirits,  as well as of the Fereurs, or divine ideas to the impersonal Unity,  seems to be rather that of emanations, than parts of a Whole. Again, if  it be true that, according to the Zend Avesta, the conflict of light and  darkness will ultimately cease, and Ahriman with his demons be  annihilated, it is obvious that this implies a beginning and an end,  with a process originating in the one, and consummated in the other. But  such a process, though most actual on the finite scale, and joyfully or  painfully real to us, contemplating, as we do only infinitesimal parts  of the Universe, and always under the forms of time and space, is yet  incongruous and incommensurate with the thought of one All in All,  unlimited by time or space, and whose lifetime is an Eternal Now. Thus  true Pantheism takes the Universe, as it is, in its infinity; regards it  as without beginning or end; and worships it. Not that Pantheism denies  the existence of evil or is unmoved by the struggle between evil and  good, or is uninspired by faith in the reiterated triumph of good  wherever the local conflict arises. But it insists that evil is relative  to the finite parts of the Universe in their supposed isolation, and  cannot possibly affect the Eternal All. It allows of no creation or  emanation which would put any part of the \"wondrous Whole\" in opposition  to, or separation from, the Eternal. But from its point of view all  change, evolution, progress retrogression, sin, pain, or any other good  or evil is local, finite, partial; while the infinite coordination of  such infinitesimal movements make one eternal peace.    [Sidenote: Pantheism in Ancient Egypt]    [Sidenote: Permanent Effects of Prehistoric Animism.]    [Sidenote: Isis, according to Plutarch.]    Egyptian Religion need not detain us. For though, there are clear traces  of Pantheistic speculation among the Priests, it can scarcely be  contended that such speculations had the same influence on the cultured  laity as the teaching of the Rishis had in ancient India. But the truth  seems to be that the oldest popular theology of Egypt was only a variety  of Negro animism and fetishism.[9] Yet these grovelling superstitions,  as is often the case, evolved in unbroken continuity a higher faith.  For, in the attempt made to adapt this savage cult to the religious  needs of various districts, all alike gradually advancing in culture,  the number and variety of divinities became so bewildering to the  priests, that the latter almost inevitably adopted the device of  recognising in parochial gods only so many hints of one  all-comprehensive divine energy. Not that they ever embraced  monotheism--or the belief in one personal God distinct from the  Universe. But if Plutarch be accurate--as there seems no reason to  doubt, in his record of an inscription in a temple of Isis--they, or at  least the most spiritual of them, found refuge in Pantheism. For the  transfigured and glorified goddess was not regarded as the maker of the  Universe, but as identical with it, and therefore unknowable, \"I am all  that hath been, is, or shall be; and no mortal has lifted my veil.\" The  prevalence of such Pantheism, at least among the learned and spiritual  of ancient Egypt, is, to a considerable extent, confirmed by other Greek  writers besides Plutarch. But the inscription noted by Plutarch gives  the sum and substance of what they tell us.    [Sidenote: Greek Pantheism]    [Sidenote: Evolved from Polytheism]    Before considering the classical and Neo-platonic Greek speculations  commonly regarded as Pantheistic, we may do well to recall to mind the  immense difference between the established habit of theological thought  in our day, and the vague, or at best, poetically vivid ideas of the  ancients. For the long tradition of nearly two thousand years, which has  made monotheism to us almost as fixed an assumption as that of our own  individuality, was entirely wanting in this case. Not that the idea of  one supreme God had never been suggested. But it was not the Hebrew or  Christian idea that was occasionally propounded; for in the ethnic mind  it was rarely, if ever, regarded as inconsistent with polytheism; and  consequently it verged on Pantheism. \"Consequently,\" I say, because such  monotheism as existed had necessarily to explain the innumerable minor  deities as emanations from, or manifestations of the supreme God. And  though such conscious attempts at reconciliation of beliefs in many gods  and in one Supreme were confined to a small minority of meditative  priests and speculative philosophers, yet really, the combination was  implicit in the sort of polytheistic religion which possessed the  family affections and patriotic associations of the early Greek world.    [Sidenote: Not the Material Figure but the Divinity Suggested was the  Object of Worship.]    For though we may find a difficulty in ridding ourselves of a prejudice  wrought into the tissue of our early faith by the nursery lessons of  childhood, it was not the graven or molten image which was really  worshipped by the devout, but that form of superhuman power which, by  local accident, had been identified with the \"idol.\" If, indeed, we  supposed every \"idolator\" to have received definite religious teaching,  analogous to that with which we ourselves were imbued in youth, we might  well find his attitude inconceivable. But he had nothing of the kind. He  only knew that in war, in hunting, in fishing, in farming, he was  confronted with powers which passed his comprehension; and tradition  permeated him with the expectation that such powers would be propitiated  by his worship of the images set up in their names. There was therefore  no reasoned creed, such as those of the Catholic and Reformed Churches,  but only a vague sentiment brought to a focus by the associations of the  shrine. From such a view of polytheism it is easy to understand how  most, if not all, of the old speculative philosophers could allow the  existence of the traditional gods, even while in reasoned contemplation  they saw that all deities were subordinate to and merged in one  universal God.    [Sidenote: Possible Influence of Oriental Pantheism.]    How far this unstable religious position was subject to the influence of  the oriental mysticism at which we have glanced already, is, at any  rate, so far as concerns the classical age of Greek philosophy, a matter  of conjecture. But the resurrection of a prehistoric and almost  forgotten civilization from the buried cities of Crete has brought to  light many evidences of frequent intercourse, two or three thousand  years before the Christian era, between European and Egyptian, or  Asiatic, centres of life. Therefore, we may well believe that during the  earliest stages of the evolution of thought in East and West, it was as  impossible as at the present time for any local school of thinkers to be  absolutely original or independent. Thus, later Greek philosophers,  whether themselves within sound of the echoes of Hindoo teaching or not,  may very well have grown up in an atmosphere impregnated with mythic  germs, whose origin they did not know. But however that may be, Greek  Pantheism, while it had many points of contact with Eastern speculation,  was more purely intellectual and less essentially religious than the  Pantheism of the Vedas, or the solemn dream that haunted Egyptian  temples. For while the aspiration of Hindoo Pantheists was to find and  assume the right attitude toward \"the glory of the sum of things,\" the  Greeks, as St. Paul long afterward said, \"sought after wisdom,\" and were  fascinated by the idea of tracing all the bewildering variety of Nature  up to some one \"principle\" ([Greek: arche]), beginning, origin.    [Sidenote: Thales, about 640 B.C.]    Thus Thales of Miletus, during the late seventh and early sixth century  B.C., is said to have been satisfied when he found in water--or  moisture--the ultimate principle out of which all things and all life,  including gods and men, were evolved. With such a speculation of infant  philosophy we are here not concerned, except to say that it was not  Pantheism as understood in modern times. For while his ablest exponents  admit that no sufficient evidence is left to show very clearly what he  meant, there seems no reason for supposing that to him the Universe was  a Living God.
