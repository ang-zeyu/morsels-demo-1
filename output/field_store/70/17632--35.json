DEFLECTION OF LIGHT    The bending of a ray of light thus described is much too light on the  surface of the earth to be observed. But the attraction of gravitation  exercised by the sun on its surface is, because of its great mass, more  than twenty-seven times stronger, and a ray of light that goes close by  the superficies of the sun must surely be noticeably bent. The rays of  a star that are seen at a short distance from the edge of the sun will,  going along the sun, deviate so much from the original direction that  they strike the eye of an observer as if they came in a straight line  from a point somewhat further removed than the real position of the  star from the sun. It is at that point that we think we see the star;  so here is a seeming displacement from the sun, which increases in the  measure in which the star is observed closer to the sun. The Einstein  theory teaches that the displacement is in inverse proportion to the  apparent distance of the star from the centre of the sun, and that for  a star just on its edge it will amount to 1'.75 (1.75 seconds). This is  approximately the thousandth part of the apparent diameter of the sun.    Naturally, the phenomenon can only be observed when there is a total  eclipse of the sun; then one can take photographs of neighboring stars  and through comparing the plate with a picture of the same part of  the heavens taken at a time when the sun was far removed from that  point the sought-for movement to one side may become apparent.    Thus to put the Einstein theory to the test was the principal aim of  the English expeditions sent out to observe the eclipse of May 29,  one to Prince's Island, off the coast of Guinea, and the other to  Sobral, Brazil. The first-named expedition's observers were Eddington  and Cottingham, those of the second, Crommelin and Davidson. The  conditions were especially favorable, for a very large number of  bright stars were shown on the photographic plate; the observers at  Sobral being particularly lucky in having good weather.    The total eclipse lasted five minutes, during four of which it was  perfectly clear, so that good photographs could be taken. In the  report issued regarding the results the following figures, which are  the average of the measurements made from the seven plates, are given  for the displacements of seven stars:    1''.02, 0''.92, 0''.84, 0''.58, 0''.54, 0''.36, 0''.24, whereas,  according to the theory, the displacements should have amounted to:  0''.88, 0''.80, 0''.75, 0''.40, 0''.52, 0''.33, 0''.20.    If we consider that, according to the theory the displacements must  be in inverse ratio to the distance from the centre of the sun, then  we may deduce from each observed displacement how great the sideways  movement for a star at the edge of the sun should have been. As the  most probable result, therefore, the number 1''.98 was found from  all the observations together. As the last of the displacements given  above--i.e., 0''.24 is about one-eighth of this, we may say that the  influence of the attraction of the sun upon light made itself felt  upon the ray at a distance eight times removed from its centre.    The displacements calculated according to the theory are, just because  of the way in which they are calculated, in inverse proportion to the  distance to the centre. Now that the observed deviations also accord  with the same rule, it follows that they are surely proportionate  with the calculated displacements. The proportion of the first and  the last observed sidewise movements is 4.2, and that of the two most  extreme of the calculated numbers is 4.4.    This result is of importance, because thereby the theory is excluded,  or at least made extremely improbable, that the phenomenon of  refraction is to be ascribed to, a ring of vapor surrounding the  sun for a great distance. Indeed, such a refraction should cause a  deviation in the observed direction, and, in order to produce the  displacement of one of the stars under observation itself a slight  proximity of the vapor ring should be sufficient, but we have every  reason to expect that if it were merely a question of a mass of  gas around the sun the diminishing effect accompanying a removal  from the sun should manifest itself much faster than is really the  case. We cannot speak with perfect certainty here, as all the factors  that might be of influence upon the distribution of density in a sun  atmosphere are not well enough known, but we can surely demonstrate  that in case one of the gasses with which we are acquainted were held  in equilibrium solely by the influence of attraction of the sun the  phenomenon should become much less as soon as we got somewhat further  from the edge of the sun. If the displacement of the first star, which  amounts to 1.02-seconds were to be ascribed to such a mass of gas, then  the displacement of the second must already be entirely inappreciable.    So far as the absolute extent of the displacements is concerned, it  was found somewhat too great, as has been shown by the figures given  above; it also appears from the final result to be 1.98 for the edge  of the sun--i.e., 13 per cent, greater than the theoretical value  of 1.75. It indeed seems that the discrepancies may be ascribed to  faults in observations, which supposition is supported by the fact  that the observations at Prince's Island, which, it is true, did not  turn out quite as well as those mentioned above, gave the result,  of 1.64, somewhat lower than Einstein's figure.    (The observations made with a second instrument at Sobral gave a  result of 0.93, but the observers are of the opinion that because of  the shifting of the mirror which reflected the rays no value is to  be attached to it.)        DIFFICULTY EXAGGERATED    During a discussion of the results obtained at a joint meeting of  the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society held especially  for that purpose recently in London, it was the general opinion that  Einstein's prediction might be regarded as justified, and warm tributes  to his genius were made on all sides. Nevertheless, I cannot refrain,  while I am mentioning it, from expressing my surprise that, according  to the report in The Times there should be so much complaint about  the difficulty of understanding the new theory. It is evident that  Einstein's little book \"About the Special and the General Theory of  Relativity in Plain Terms,\" did not find its way into England during  wartime. Any one reading it will, in my opinion, come to the conclusion  that the basic ideas of the theory are really clear and simple; it is  only to be regretted that it was impossible to avoid clothing them in  pretty involved mathematical terms, but we must not worry about that.    I allow myself to add that, as we follow Einstein, we may retain  much of what has been formerly gained. The Newtonian theory remains  in its full value as the first great step, without which one cannot  imagine the development of astronomy and without which the second  step, that has now been made, would hardly have been possible. It  remains, moreover, as the first, and in most cases, sufficient,  approximation. It is true that, according to Einstein's theory,  because it leaves us entirely free as to the way in which we wish to  represent the phenomena, we can imagine an idea of the solar system  in which the planets follow paths of peculiar form and the rays of  light shine along sharply bent lines--think of a twisted and distorted  planetarium--but in every case where we apply it to concrete questions  we shall so arrange it that the planets describe almost exact ellipses  and the rays of light almost straight lines.    It is not necessary to give up entirely even the ether. Many natural  philosophers find satisfaction in the idea of a material intermediate  substance in which the vibrations of light take place, and they  will very probably be all the more inclined to imagine such a medium  when they learn that, according to the Einstein theory, gravitation  itself does not spread instantaneously, but with a velocity that at  the first estimate may be compared with that of light. Especially in  former years were such interpretations current and repeated attempts  were made by speculations about the nature of the ether and about  the mutations and movements that might take place in it to arrive  at a clear presentation of electro-magnetic phenomena, and also of  the functioning of gravitation. In my opinion it is not impossible  that in the future this road, indeed abandoned at present, will once  more be followed with good results, if only because it can lead to the  thinking out of new experimental tests. Einstein's theory need not keep  us from so doing; only the ideas about the ether must accord with it.    Nevertheless, even without the color and clearness that the ether  theories and the other models may be able to give, and even,  we can feel it this way, just because of the soberness induced  by their absence, Einstein's work, we may now positively expect,  will remain a monument of science; his theory entirely fulfills  the first and principal demand that we may make, that of deducing  the course of phenomena from certain principles exactly and to the  smallest details. It was certainly fortunate that he himself put the  ether in the background; if he had not done so, he probably would  never have come upon the idea that has been the foundation of all  his examinations.    Thanks to his indefatigable exertions and perseverance, for he had  great difficulties to overcome in his attempts, Einstein has attained  the results, which I have tried to sketch, while still young; he is  now 45 years old. He completed his first investigations in Switzerland,  where he first was engaged in the Patent Bureau at Berne and later as a  professor at the Polytechnic in Zurich.

The Mexican population is commonly divided into seven classes:--1.  European Spaniards, commonly called \"_gachupines_.\" 2. White Creoles.  3. Mestizos, descendants of Whites and Indians. 4. Mulattoes,  descendants of Whites and Blacks. 5. Zambos, from Indians and Negroes.  6. Pure Indians. 7. African Blacks. But this classification may be  reduced to four:--1. Whites. 2. Indians. 3. Blacks. 4. Mixed Races,  the various gradations of which may be considered almost infinite.    The Indians consist of a considerable number of distinct tribes,  differing in many points of appearance, and speaking--not dialects  but--languages entirely different. No less than twenty of these have  been traced, and of fourteen of them there are already grammars and  dictionaries. The Indian population is chiefly centered in the great  plains, and towards the south; and Humboldt thinks that it has flowed  from the north to the south. The history of four great migrations is  preserved in the annals of Mexico, which are worthy of more detailed  examination than we can bestow upon them. The great body of these  people live apart from the other races of their countrymen, in small  villages, full of ignorance, suspicion, and bigotry, and displaying an  apparent phlegm, from which it would seem impossible to arouse them.  This phlegmatic temperament lessens the credit of the men with the  females, who uniformly prefer the European, or the still more  vivacious negro. \"The indigenous Mexican is grave, melancholic,  silent, so long as he is not under the influence of intoxicating  liquors. This gravity is peculiarly remarkable in Indian children, who  at the age of four or five years display more intelligence and  precocity than the children of whites. The Mexican loves to attach  mystery even to his most trifling actions; the strongest passions do  not display themselves in his countenance; the transition is frightful  when it passes suddenly from a state of absolute repose to that of  violent and unrestrained agitation.\" Slavery with them has engendered  guile. They are obstinate in all their habits and opinions; their  religion is one of mere ceremonial, justifying the observation of  a priest to Mr. Ward, \"son mui buenos Catolicos, pero mui malos  Cristianos\" (very good Catholics, but very bad Christians.) Deception  in this, as well as in every thing else, is the order of the day; and  the Indian Alcalde now oppresses the villagers as much as he himself  has ever been.    Humboldt considers the Mexican Indian as destitute of all imagination,  though when to a certain degree educated, he attributes to him  facility in learning, a clearness of understanding, a natural turn for  reasoning, and a particular aptitude to subtilize and seize trifling  distinctions.    The music and dancing are as dull as might be expected among beings so  full of phlegm. The Mexican has a turn for painting and sculpture; and  retains the same fondness for flowers that struck Cortez so forcibly  upwards of three centuries ago. The \"Indios Bravos,\" or Wild Indians,  are said to display more energy; but our information respecting them  is remarkably scanty.    Among the active vices of the Mexican Indian, that of drunkenness  prevails to a most lamentable extent. In the upper districts,  _pulque_, or the fermented juice of the aloe, is the principal  tempter; sometimes a spirit, distilled from the same plant, called  _Vino de Mescal_; while, in the hotter districts, the same effects are  ensured by the _chinguirito_, a very coarse kind of rum. Combined with  this disposition to intoxication, the Indian is constitutionally  indolent; and, now that he is a free man, he will rarely work, except  to obtain just as much as will afford him the means of enjoying his  greatest luxury--that of steeping his senses in oblivion. This last  tendency is much to be deplored, as, in the larger towns, we know that  every Sunday (which is the day of greatest indulgence) assassinations,  to the extent of six or eight each day, are the melancholy consequence  of its indulgence. Humboldt states that the police were in the  practice of sending tumbrels round, to collect the unhappy victims of  intoxication. The punishment was, and we believe still is, three days'  labour in the streets; but it does not seem to be very efficacious,  for generally within the week the delinquents are again in custody.    There is something characteristic in the indolence of these sombre  beings. They will travel immense distances; but to steady labour they  are, generally speaking, not prone. It is told of them, that in one of  the most fertile districts (the _Baxio_) it is not unusual for an  Indian, on receiving his wages, to get thoroughly drunk, go to sleep,  and on awakening renew his potations and repose, until the exhaustion  of his finances compels him to return to labour. In some parts,  however, there are exceptions to this observation.    Education has been more attended to, by some of the leading  personages, than could have been expected in a society that had been  so much kept in the shade. We apprehend the advantages are chiefly  prospective, and may be well defined in another generation; at present  they are but small. The whites have been, and still are, the most  educated portion of the Mexicans, owing, no doubt, to their greater  opulence, and having access to official rank. The mass of ignorance,  however, among all classes, is inconceivable to any one who has only  moved in the principal countries of Europe. Nor is it confined to the  lower classes, but finds protection among the highest in the  community. We heard a reverend canon of the metropolitan church  gravely inquire, whether it was possible to reach London except by  sailing up the Thames. And we knew a very pretty, agreeable young  lady, moving in the first circles, who could not write a single letter  at the age of seventeen. She has been since married, and has, we are  informed, been taught to write by her husband, who is not a Mexican.  The religion of all classes resembles too much that of the Indians;  and the practical morality and general tone of society are by no means  refined. If one half of the scandalous tales in circulation be true,  the former ranks with that of Paris in its worst periods, and the  latter is assuredly gross to a degree that would surprise even an  inhabitant of Madrid. The familiarity with which _every subject_ is  treated at first excites emotions in an Englishman of the most  unpleasant kind, which gradually subside, from the frequency with  which they are discussed by young and old; by high and low, of both  sexes.--_Foreign Quarterly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *          Notes of a Reader.           *       *       *       *       *    SIR WALTER SCOTT'S NEW WORK.      We detach this little descriptive gem from Sir Walter Scott's \"Anne of  Geierstein,\" just published. An outline of this very delightful novel  will be found in a SUPPLEMENT with the present number of the MIRROR.    \"The ancient tower of Geierstein, though neither extensive, nor  distinguished by architectural ornament, possessed an air of terrible  dignity by its position on the very verge of the opposite bank of the  torrent, which, just at the angle of the rock on which the ruins are  situated, falls sheer over a cascade of nearly a hundred feet in  height, and then rushes down the defile, through a trough of living  rock, which perhaps its waves have been deepening since time itself  had a commencement. Facing, and at the same time looking down upon  this eternal roar of waters, stood the old tower, built so close to  the verge of the precipice, that the buttresses with which the  architect had strengthened the foundation, seemed a part of the solid  rock itself, and a continuation of its perpendicular ascent. As usual,  throughout Europe in the feudal times, the principal part of the  building was a massive square pile, the decayed summit of which was  rendered picturesque, by flanking turrets of different sizes and  heights, some round, some angular, some ruinous, some tolerably  entire, varying the outline of the building as seen against the stormy  sky.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THORWALDSEN.      Since the death of his illustrious contemporary, Canova, Thorwaldsen,  born at Copenhagen in 1771-2, has occupied the public eye as head of  the modern school. The character and powers of this master are  doubtless of a very elevated rank: but neither in the extent nor  excellence of his works, do we apprehend his station to be so high as  sometimes placed. The genius of the Danish sculptor is forcible, yet  is its energy derived more from peculiarity than from real excellence.  His ideal springs less from imitation of the antique, or of nature,  than from the workings of his own individual mind--it is the creation  of a fancy seeking forcible effect in singular combinations, rather  than in general principles; therefore hardly fitted to excite lasting  or beneficial influence upon the age. Simplicity and imposing  expression seem to have hitherto formed the principal objects of  his pursuit; but the distinction between the simple and rude, the  powerful and the exaggerated, is not always observed in the labours  of the Dane. His simplicity is sometimes without grace; the  impressive--austere, and without due refinement. The air and contours  of his heads, except, as in the Mercury--an excellent example both of  the beauties and defects of the artist's style--when immediately  derived from antiquity, though grand and vigorous, seldom harmonize in  the principles of these efforts with the majestic regularity of  general nature. The forms, again, are not unfrequently poor, without a  vigorous rendering of the parts, and destitute at times of their just  roundness."]]]
