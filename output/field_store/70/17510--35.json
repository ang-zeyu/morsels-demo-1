But, alas, no one could remember where they  were. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish  up the doll's teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lamb  had dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-butt  and the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones.    'Never mind,' said Robert, 'we'll get it out with the poker and the  shovel.'    'Oh, stop,' cried Anthea. 'Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believe  something IS going to happen!'    For the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Next  moment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out of  it came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, and  as it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and  bigger under their eyes.    Every mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle.    The bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew out  into the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where it  passed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The children  looked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It put  its head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrot  do when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardly  astonished at all when it said, 'Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.'    They were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested.    They looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Its  feathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only its  beak was not at all bantam-shaped. 'I believe I know what it is,' said  Robert. 'I've seen a picture.'    He hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father's  study table yielded, as the sum-books say, 'the desired result'. But  when he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, 'I say,  look here,' the others all said 'Hush!' and he hushed obediently and  instantly, for the bird was speaking.    'Which of you,' it was saying, 'put the egg into the fire?'    'He did,' said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert.    The bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else.    'I am your grateful debtor,' it said with a high-bred air.    The children were all choking with wonder and curiosity--all except  Robert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. He  said--    '_I_ know who you are.'    And he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was a  little picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames.    'You are the Phoenix,' said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased.    'My fame has lived then for two thousand years,' it said. 'Allow me to  look at my portrait.' It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down,  spread out in the fender, and said--    'It's not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?' it  asked, pointing to the printed part.    'Oh, that's all dullish; it's not much about YOU, you know,' said Cyril,  with unconscious politeness; 'but you're in lots of books.'    'With portraits?' asked the Phoenix.    'Well, no,' said Cyril; 'in fact, I don't think I ever saw any portrait  of you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if you  like.'    The Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old  Encyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:--    'Phoenix--in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.'    'Antiquity is quite correct,' said the Phoenix, 'but fabulous--well, do  I look it?'    Every one shook its head. Cyril went on--      'The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its  kind.'    'That's right enough,' said the Phoenix.    'They describe it as about the size of an eagle.'    'Eagles are of different sizes,' said the Phoenix; 'it's not at all a  good description.'    All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near the  Phoenix as possible.    'You'll boil your brains,' it said. 'Look out, I'm nearly cool now;' and  with a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table.  It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning  when it had settled itself on the table-cloth.    'It's only a very little scorched,' said the Phoenix, apologetically;  'it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.'    The children gathered round the table.    'The size of an eagle,' Cyril went on, 'its head finely crested with a  beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and  the rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling  like stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in the  wilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet  wood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thus  burns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows  up to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave--'    'Never mind what they gave,' said the Phoenix, ruffling its golden  feathers. 'They never gave much, anyway; they always were people who  gave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It's  most inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as for  my--tail--well, I simply ask you, IS it white?'    It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children.    'No, it's not,' said everybody.    'No, and it never was,' said the Phoenix. 'And that about the worm  is just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectable  birds. It makes a pile--that part's all right--and it lays its egg, and  it burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comes  out and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can't tell  you how weary I got of it--such a restless existence; no repose.'    'But how did your egg get HERE?' asked Anthea.    'Ah, that's my life-secret,' said the Phoenix. 'I couldn't tell it to  any one who wasn't really sympathetic. I've always been a misunderstood  bird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tell  YOU,' it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry.  'You put me on the fire--' Robert looked uncomfortable.    'The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,'  said Cyril.    'And--and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,' said Robert,  telling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how the  Phoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner.    'Your candid avowal,' it said, 'removes my last scruple. I will tell you  my story.'    'And you won't vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea,  anxiously.    'Why?' it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, 'do you wish me to  stay here?'    'Oh YES,' said every one, with unmistakable sincerity.    'Why?' asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth.    'Because,' said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Jane  added after a pause, 'you are the most beautiful person we've ever  seen.' 'You are a sensible child,' said the Phoenix, 'and I will NOT  vanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided,  as your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which is  a large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I was  becoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habit  of laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years--and you  know how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.'    'Yes,' said Cyril; 'Jane used to bite her nails.'    'But I broke myself of it,' urged Jane, rather hurt, 'You know I did.'    'Not till they put bitter aloes on them,' said Cyril.    'I doubt,' said the bird, gravely, 'whether even bitter aloes (the aloe,  by the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure before  seeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of flowering  but once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured  ME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream--it was  getting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that  tedious egg upon it--and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They were  sitting on a carpet--and when I accosted them civilly they narrated to  me their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will now  proceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story of  their parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In early  youth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain  enchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. The  enchanter--'    'Oh, please don't,' said Anthea. 'I can't understand all these  beginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in  them every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That's what we really want  to hear.'    'Well,' said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, 'to  cut about seventy long stories short (though _I_ had to listen to them  all--but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), this  prince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want  any one else, and the enchanter--don't be alarmed, I won't go into  his history--had given them a magic carpet (you've heard of a magic  carpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right  away from every one--and it had brought them to the wilderness. And as  they meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so they  gave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!'    'I don't see what you wanted with a carpet,' said Jane, 'when you've got  those lovely wings.'    'They ARE nice wings, aren't they?' said the Phoenix, simpering and  spreading them out. 'Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and I  laid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, \"Now, my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#3)"],[1,"this recognition of ancestors  furnishes a potent means of promoting family unity and social ethics,  and, most of all, because a happy future life is supposed to be  dependent upon descendants who will faithfully minister to the dead.  Since each one desires such a future he is faithful in promoting the  observance of the obligation. Consequently, ancestor worship, like the  previously mentioned belief in the invisible spiritual world, underlies  all other religious developments. No family is so obscure or poor that  it does not submit to the ritual or discipline which is supposed to  ensure the favor of the spirits belonging to the community. Likewise,  every such family is loyal to the supposed needs of its deceased  ancestors. In a very intimate way these beliefs are interwoven with the  private and social morality of every family or group in Chinese society,  and must be taken into account by any one who seeks to bring a religious  message to the Chinese people.    _3. Degenerate Taoism_    Taoism is that system of Chinese religious thought and practice,  beginning about the fifth century B. C., which was originally based on  the teachings of Lao Tzu and developed in the writings of Lieh Tzu and  Chuang Tzu and found in the Tao Tê Ching. It is really in this original  form a philosophy of some merit. According to its teaching the Tao is  the great impersonal background of the world from which all things  proceed as beams from the sun, and to which all beings return. In  contrast to the present, transient, changing world the Tao is  unchangeable and quiet. Originally the Taoists emphasized quiescence, a  life in accordance with nature, as a means of assimilating themselves to  the Tao, believing that in this way they would obtain length of days,  eternal life and especially the power to become superior to natural  conditions.    There is a movement today among Chinese scholars in favor of a return to  this original highest form of Taoism. It appeals to them as a philosophy  of life; an answer to its riddles. Among the masses of the people,  however, Taoism manifests itself in a ritual of extreme superstition. It  recommends magic tricks and curious superstitions as a means of  prolonging life. It expresses itself very largely in these degrading  practices which few Chinese will defend, but which are yet very commonly  practiced.    _4. The Organizing Value of Confucianism_    Confucianism brought organization into these hazy conceptions of life  and duty. It took for granted this spiritual-unspiritual background of  animism, ancestor-worship and Taoism, but reshaped and adapted it as a  whole so that it might fit into that proper organization of the state  and nation which was one of its great objectives. Just as Confucianism  related the family to the village, the village to the district, and the  district to the state, so it organized the spiritual world into a  hierarchy with Shang Ti as its head. This hierarchy was developed along  the lines of the organization mentioned above. Under Shang Ti were the  five cosmic emperors, one for each of the four quarters and one for  heaven above, under whom were the gods of the soil, the mountains,  rivers, seas, stars, the sun and moon, the ancestors and the gods of  special groups. Each of the deities in the various ranks had duties to  those above and rights with reference to those below. These duties and  rights, as they affected the individual, were not only expressed in law  but were embodied in ceremony and music, in daily religious life and  practice in such a way that each individual had reason to feel that he  was a functioning agent in this grand Confucian universe. If any one  failed to do his part, the whole universe would suffer. So thoroughly  has this idea been adopted by the Chinese people that every one joins in  forcing an individual, however reluctant or careless, to perform his  part of each ceremony as it has been ordered from high antiquity.    The emperor alone worshipped the supreme deity, Shang Ti; the great  officers of state, according to the dignity of their office, were  related to subordinate gods and required to show them adequate respect  and reverence. Confucius and a long line of noted men following him were  semi-deified [Footnote: Confucius was by imperial decree deified in  1908.] and highly reverenced by the literati, the class from which the  officers of state were as a rule obtained, in connection with their  duties, and as an expression of their ideals. To the common people were  left the ordinary local deities, while all classes, of course, each in  its own fashion reverenced, cherished and obeyed their ancestors. It  should be remarked at this point that Confucianism of this official  character has broken down, not only under the impact of modern ideas,  but under the longing of the Chinese for a universal deity. The people  turn to Heaven and to the Pearly Emperor, the popular counterpart of  Shang Ti.    Viewed from another angle, Confucianism is an elaborate system of  ethics. In writings which are virtually the scriptures of the Chinese  people Confucius and his successors have set forth the principles which  should govern the life of a people who recognize this spiritual universe  and system. These ethics have grown out of a long and, in some respects,  a sound experience. Much can be said in their favor. The essential  weaknesses of the Confucian system of ethics lie in its sectional and  personal loyalties and its monarchical basis. The spirit of democracy is  a deadly foe to Confucianism. Another element of weakness is its  excessive dependence upon the past. Confucius reached ultimate wisdom by  the study of the best that had been attained before his day. He looked  backward rather than forward. Consequently a modern, broadly educated  Confucianist finds himself in an anomalous position. He does not need  absolutely to reject the wisdom which Confucianism embodies, but he can  no longer accept it as a sound, reliable and indisputable scheme of  thought and action. Yet its simple ethical principles and its social  relationships are basal in the lives of the vast masses of the Chinese.    _5. Buddhism an Inclusive Religion._    Upon this, confused jumble of spiritism, superstition, loyalty to  ancestors and submission to a divine hierarchy Buddhism was  superimposed. It quickly dominated all because of its superior  excellence. The form of Buddhism which became established in China was  not, to be sure, like the Buddhism preached by Gautama and his  disciples, or like that form of Buddhism which had taken root in Burma  or Ceylon. Except in name, the Buddhism of Southern Asia and the  Buddhism which developed in China were virtually two distinct types of  religion. The Buddhism of Burma and Ceylon was of the conservative  Hînayâna (\"Little Vehicle\" of salvation) school, while that of China was  of the progressive Mahâyâna (\"Great Vehicle\" of salvation) school. Their  differences are so marked as to be worthy of a careful statement.    The Hinayana, which is today the type of Buddhism in Ceylon, Burma and  Siam, has always clung closely to tradition as expressed in the original  Buddhist scriptures. Its basic ideas were that life is on the whole a  time of suffering, that the cause of this sorrow is desire or ignorance,  and that there is a possible deliverance from it. This deliverance or  salvation is to be attained by following the eightfold path, namely,  right knowledge, aspiration, speech, conduct, means of livelihood,  endeavor, mindfulness and meditation. To the beatific state to be  ultimately attained Gautama gave the name Nirvana, explained by his  followers variously either as an utter extinction of personality or as a  passionless peace, a general state of well-being free from all evil  desire or clinging to life and released from the chain of  transmigration. Hinayana Buddhism appeals to the individual as affording  a way of escape from evil desire and its consequences by acquiring  knowledge, by constant discipline, and by a devotedness of the life to  religious ends through membership in the monastic order which Buddha  established. It encourages, however, a personal salvation worked out by  the individual alone.    The Mahâyâna school of Buddhists accept the general ideas of the  Hinayana regarding life and salvation, but so change the spirit and  objectives as to make Buddhism into what is virtually another religion.  It does not confine salvation to the few who can retire from the world  and give themselves wholly to good works, but opens Buddhahood to all.  The \"saint\" of Hinayana Buddhism is the _arhat_ who is intent on  saving himself. The saint of Mahâyâna Buddhism is the candidate for  Buddhahood (Bodhisattva) who defers his entrance into the bliss of  deliverance in order to save others. Mahâyâna Buddhism is progressive.  It encourages missionary enterprise and was a secret of the remarkable  spread of Buddhism over Asia. Moreover, while the Hînayâna school  recognizes no god or being to whom worship is given, the Mahâyanâ came  to regard Gautama himself as a god and salvation as life in a heavenly  world of pure souls. Thus the Mahâyâna type of thinking constitutes a  bridge between Hînayâna Buddhism and Christianity. In fact, a recent  writer has declared that Hînayâna Buddhists are verging toward these  more spiritual conceptions. [Footnote: See Saunders, _Buddhism and  Buddhists in Southern Asia,_ pp. 10, 20.]    After the death of Sâkyamuni [Footnote: Sâkyamuni is the name by which  Gautama, the Buddha, is familiarly known in China.] Buddhism broke up  into a number of sects usually said to be eighteen in number. When  Buddhism came to China some of these sects were introduced, but they  assumed new forms in their Chinese environment. Besides the sects  brought, from India the Chinese developed several strong sects of their  own. Usually they speak of ten sects although the"]]]
