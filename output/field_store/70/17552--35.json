When the ships of all nations sail up to the  capital, then the ideas of Peter the Great, when he laid the foundations  of St. Petersburg, will be realized. St. Petersburg will be no longer an  inland port. It will, with its ample harbor and numerous canals among  its streets, become the Venice of the North. Its era of commercial  greatness is now about to commence. The ceremony of letting the waters  of the canal into the new docks was performed by the Emperor in October,  1883. The Empress and heir apparent, with a large number of the Court,  were present on the occasion. The works on the canal, costing about a  million and a half sterling, were begun in 1876, and have been carried  out under the direction of a committee appointed by the Government,  presided over by his Excellency, N. Sarloff. The resident engineer is M.  Phofiesky; and the contractors are Messrs. Maximovitch and Boreysha.\"    We heartily congratulate the Russian government and the Russian nation  upon the accomplishment of this great and useful work of peace. It will  certainly benefit English trade. The value of British imports from the  northern ports of Russia for the year 1883 was L13,799,033; British  exports, L6,459,993; while from the southern ports of Russia our trade  was: British imports, L7,177,149; British exports, L1,169,890--making a  total British commerce with European Russia of L20,976,182 imports from  Russia and L7,629,883 exports to Russia. It cannot be to the interest of  nations which are such large customers of each other to go to war  about a few miles of Afguhan frontier. The London _Chamber of Commerce  Journal_, ably edited by Mr. Kenric B. Murray, Secretary to the Chamber,  has in its May number an article upon this subject well deserving of  perusal. It points out that in case of war most of the British export  trade to Russia would go through Germany, and might possibly never again  return under British control. In spite of Russian protective duties,  this trade has been well maintained, even while the British import  of Russian commodities, wheat, flax, hemp, tallow, and timber, was  declining 40 per cent. from 1883 to 1884. The St. Petersburg Maritime  Canal will evidently give much improved facilities to the direct export  of English goods to Russia. Without reference to our own manufactures,  it should be observed that the Russian cotton mills, including those of  Poland, consume yearly 264 million pounds of cotton, most of which comes  through England. The importation of English coal to Russia has afforded  a noteworthy instance of the disadvantage hitherto occasioned by the  want of direct navigation to St. Petersburg; the freight of a ton of  coal from Newcastle to Cronstadt was six shillings and sixpence, but  from Cronstadt to St. Petersburg it cost two shillings more. It is often  said, in a tone of alarm and reproach, that Russia is very eager to get  to the sea. The more Russia gets to the sea everywhere, the better it  will be for British trade with Russia; and friendly intercourse with  an empire containing nearly a hundred millions of people is not to be  lightly rejected.--_Illustrated London News_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW FRENCH DISPATCH BOAT MILAN.      The Milan, a new dispatch boat, has recently been making trial trips at  Brest. It was constructed at Saint Nazaire, by the \"Societe des Ateliers  et Chantiers de la Loire,\" and is the fastest man-of-war afloat. It  has registered 17 knots with ordinary pressure, and with increase  of pressure can make 18 knots, but to attain such high speed a very  powerful engine is necessary. In fact, a vessel 303 ft. long, 33 ft.  wide, and drawing 12 ft. of water, requires an engine which can develop  4,000 H.P.    [Illustration: THE NEW FRENCH DISPATCH BOAT MILAN.]    The hull of the Milan is of steel, and is distinguished for its extreme  lightness. The vessel has two screws, actuated by four engines arranged  two by two on each shaft.    The armament consists of five three inch cannons, eight revolvers, and  four tubes for throwing torpedoes.    The Milan can carry 300 tons of coal, an insufficient quantity for  a long cruise, but this vessel, which is a dispatch boat in every  acceptation of the word, was constructed for a definite purpose. It  is the first of a series of very rapid cruisers to be constructed in  France, and yet many English packets can attain a speed at least equal  to that of the Milan. We need war vessels which can attain twenty knots,  to be master of the sea.--_L'Illustration_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE LAUNCHING AND DOCKING OF SHIPS SIDEWISE.      The slips of the shipyards at Alt-Hofen (Hungary) belonging to the  Imperial and Royal Navigation Company of the Danube are so arranged that  the vessels belonging to its fleet can be hauled up high and dry or  be launched sidewise. They comprise three distinct groups, which are  adapted, according to needs, for the construction or repair of steamers,  twenty of which can be put into the yard at a time. The operation, which  is facilitated by the current of the Danube, consists in receiving the  ships upon frames beneath the water and at the extremity of inclined  planes running at right angles with them. After the ship has been made  secure by means of wedges, the frame is drawn up by chains that  wind round fixed windlasses. These apparatus are established upon a  horizontal surface 25.5 feet above low-water mark so as to give the  necessary slope, and at which terminate the tracks. They may, moreover,  be removed after the ships have been taken off, and be put down again  for launching. For 136 feet of their length the lower part of the  sliding ways is permanent, and fixed first upon rubble masonry and then  upon the earth.    Fig. 1 gives a general view of the arrangement. The eight sliding ways  of the central part are usually reserved for the largest vessels. The  two extreme ones comprise, one of them 7, and the other 6, tracks only,  and are maneuvered by means of the same windlasses as the others. A  track, FF, is laid parallel with the river, in order to facilitate,  through lorries, the loading and unloading of the traction chains. These  latter are 3/4 inch in diameter, while those that pass around the hulls  are 1 inch.    The motive power is furnished by a 10 H.P. steam engine, which serves at  the same time for actuating the machine tools employed in construction  or repairs. The shaft is situated at the head of the ways, and sets in  motion four double-gear windlasses of the type shown in Fig. 2. The  ratio of the wheels is as 9 to 1. The speed at which the ships move  forward is from 10 to 13 feet per minute. Traction is effected  continuously and without shock. After the cables have been passed around  the hull, and fastened, they are attached to four pairs of blocks each  comprising three pulleys. The lower one of these is carried by rollers  that run over a special track laid for this purpose on the inclined  plane.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--WAYS OF LAUNCHING VESSELS SIDEWISE.]    The three successive positions that a boat takes are shown in Fig. 1.  In the first it has just passed on to the frame, and is waiting to be  hauled up on the ways; in the second it is being hauled up; and in the  third the frame has been removed and the boat is shoved up on framework,  so that it can be examined and receive whatever repairs may be  necessary. This arrangement, which is from plans by Mr. Murray Jackson,  suffices to launch 16 or 18 new boats annually, and for the repair  of sixty steamers and lighters. These latter are usually 180 feet in  length, 24 feet in width, and 8 feet in depth, and their displacement,  when empty, is 120 tons. The dimensions of the largest steamers vary  between 205 and 244 feet in length, and 25 and 26 feet in width. They  are 10 feet in depth, and, when empty, displace from 440 to 460 tons.  The Austrian government has two monitors repaired from time to time in  the yards of the company. The short and wide forms of these impose a  heavier load per running foot upon the ways than ordinary boats do, but  nevertheless no difficulty has ever been experienced, either in hauling  them out or putting them back into the water.--_Le Genie Civil_.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--DETAILS OF WINDLASS.]           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED HIGH-SPEED ENGINE.      This engine, exhibited at South Kensington by Fielding and Platt, of  Gloucester, consists virtually of a universal joint connecting two  shafts whose axes form an obtuse angle of about 157 degrees. It has four  cylinders, two being mounted on a chair coupling on each shaft. The word  cylinder is used in a conventional sense only, since the cavities acting  as such are circular, whose axes, instead of being straight lines, are  arcs of circles struck from the center at which the axes of the shafts  would, if continued, intersect. The four pistons are carried upon  the gimbal ring, which connects, by means of pivots, the two chair  couplings.    [Illustration: THE FIELDING HIGH SPEED ENGINE.]    Fig. 10 shows clearly the parts constituting the coupling, cylinders,  and pistons of a compound engine. CC are the high-pressure cylinders; DD  the low pressure; EEEE the four parts forming the gimbal ring, to which  are fixed in pairs the high and low pressure pistons, GG and FF; HHHH  are the chair arms formed with the cylinders carrying pivots, IIII,  which latter fit into the bearings, JJJJ, in the gimbal ring. Figs.  1, 2, 3, 4 show these parts connected and at different points of the  shaft's rotation. The direction of rotation is shown by the arrow.

In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,  under penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place  without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to  indicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman,  when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by  her husband; others confine Women altogether in their houses except  during the religious festivals.  But it has been found by the wisest of  our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on  Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race,  but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a  State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.    For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement  at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their  spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate  climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes  destroyed in one or two hours of a simultaneous female outbreak.  Hence  the Three Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated  States, and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female  Code.    After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in  the interests of the Women themselves.  For, although they can inflict  instantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at  once disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of  their victim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.    The power of Fashion is also on our side.  I pointed out that in some  less civilized States no female is suffered to stand in any public  place without swaying her back from right to left.  This practice has  been universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all  well-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach.  It is considered a disgrace to any state that legislation should have  to enforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a  natural instinct.  The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated  undulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and  imitated by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing  beyond a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the  regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the  wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose  family no \"back-motion\" of any kind has become as yet a necessity of  life.  Hence, in every family of position and consideration, \"back  motion\" is as prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in  these households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.    Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute  of affection.  But unfortunately the passion of the moment  predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration.  This  is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation.  For as they have no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this  respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently  wholly devoid of brainpower, and have neither reflection, judgment nor  forethought, and hardly any memory.  Hence, in their fits of fury, they  remember no claims and recognize no distinctions.  I have actually  known a case where a Woman has exterminated her whole household, and  half an hour afterwards, when her rage was over and the fragments swept  away, has asked what has become of her husband and children.    Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a  position where she can turn round.  When you have them in their  apartments--which are constructed with a view to denying them that  power--you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly  impotent for mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the  incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with  death, nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make  in order to pacify their fury.    On the whole we got on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations,  except in the lower strata of the Military Classes.  There the want of  tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times  indescribable disasters.  Relying too much on the offensive weapons of  their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and  seasonable simulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect the  prescribed construction of the women's apartments, or irritate their  wives by ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse  immediately to retract.  Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal  truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises by which the more  judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort.  The result is  massacre; not, however, without its advantages, as it eliminates the  more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles; and by many of our  Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex is regarded as one among  many providential arrangements for suppressing redundant population,  and nipping Revolution in the bud.    Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families  I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in  Spaceland.  There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may  be called by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of  tastes or pursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured  safety at the cost of domestic comfort.  In every Circular or Polygonal  household it has been a habit from time immemorial--and now has become  a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes--that the  mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths  towards their husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family  of distinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a  kind of portent, involving loss of STATUS.  But, as I shall soon shew,  this custom, though it has the advantage of safety, is not without  disadvantages.    In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman--where the  wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing her  household avocations--there are at least intervals of quiet, when the  wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the  continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is  too often no peace.  There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye  are ever directed toward the Master of the household; and light itself  is not more persistent than the stream of Feminine discourse.  The tact  and skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting are unequal to the  task of stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife has absolutely  nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or  conscience to prevent her from saying it, not a few cynics have been  found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death-dealing but  inaudible sting to the safe sonorousness of a Woman's other end.    To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seen truly  deplorable, and so indeed it is.  A Male of the lowest type of the  Isosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle, and to the  ultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste; but no Woman can  entertain such hopes for her sex.  \"Once a Woman, always a Woman\" is a  Decree of Nature; and the very Laws of Evolution seem suspended in her  disfavour.  Yet at least we can admire the wise Prearrangement which  has ordained that, as they have no hopes, so they shall have no memory  to recall, and no forethought to anticipate, the miseries and  humiliations which are at once a necessity of their existence and the  basis of the constitution of Flatland.          SECTION 5  Of our Methods of Recognizing one another      You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted  with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed  with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually SEE an  angle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the  happy region of the Three Dimensions--how shall I make it clear to you  the extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing  one another's configuration?    Recall what I told you above.  All beings in Flatland, animate and  inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same, or  nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line.  How then  can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?    The answer is threefold.  The first means of recognition is the sense  of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you,  and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice of our  personal friends, but even to discriminate between different classes,  at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral,  the Square, and the Pentagon--for the Isosceles I take no account.  But  as we ascend the social scale, the process of discriminating and being  discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices  are assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is  a plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy.  And  wherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this  method.  Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a  degree more than correspondent with those of hearing, so that an  Isosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some  training, that of a Circle himself.  A second method is therefore more  commonly resorted to.    FEELING is, among our Women and lower classes--about our upper classes  I"]]]
