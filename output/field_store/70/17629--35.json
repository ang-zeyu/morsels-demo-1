There is no land, however sterile, that the art of  man may not make to produce fruit; but the difficulty and expense of  tillage must be in proportion to the intrinsic richness or poverty of the  soil. We fear that the soil of the Negroes[3], of the American Indians,  and of the Esquimaux, must be laboured at early and late, before it  brings forth even an average crop. But we do not despair even here. Still  less could we for a moment depreciate the labours of those who are  carrying education to the utmost bounds of the earth. The more degraded  and stupid the condition of any set of people may be, the more  meritorious and thankworthy are those efforts that are made to advance  them one point nearer to the heavens--one step above the beasts that  perish. The advancement of Hayti, though much overrated, is nevertheless  considerable; and we trust that national independence will co-operate  there also with the progress of learning, for the increase of happiness  and prosperity. A free government, high public spirit, and an eager  desire for wisdom, are permanent securities for the welfare of the state,  and the happiness of the citizens; and though we cannot control nature,  let us endeavour by art to supply what is wanting, where her bounty has  been limited; \"let us,\" in the words of Lord Bacon, \"labour to restore  and enlarge the power and dominion of the whole race of man over the  universe of things!\"    D.    [3] The idea of the ancient Egyptians, as mentioned by Herodotus, having      been of the same family as the Negroes, is now completely refuted by      the inquiries of Cuvier and other naturalists. The examinations of      mummies have been highly useful in setting this question at rest.           *       *       *       *       *      MORTON BRIDGE.    A BALLAD.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The remorseless tragedy on which this ballad is founded, took place  upwards of a century ago. In the retired village of Romanby, near  Northallerton, Yorkshire, there resided a desperate band of coiners,  whose respectability and cunning concealment precluded all possibility of  suspicion as to their proceedings. The victim of their revenge was Mary  Ward, the servant of one of those ruffians. Having obtained an accidental  view of some secret apartments appropriated to their treasonable  practices, she unguardedly communicated her knowledge to an acquaintance;  which reaching her master's ears, he determined to destroy her. The most  plausible story, time, and means were selected for this purpose. On a  Sunday evening, after sunset, an unknown personage on horseback arrived  at her master's mansion, half equipped, to give colour to his alleged  haste, and slated that he was dispatched for Mary, as _her mother was  dying_. She lingered to ask her master's permission; but he feigned sleep,  and she departed without his leave. On the table of her room was her  Bible, opened at those remarkable words in Job, \"They shall seek me _in  the morning_, and shall not find me; and where I am, they shall not come.\"  Her home was at the distance of eight miles from Romanby; and Morton  bridge, hard by the heath where she was murdered, is the traditionary  scene of her nocturnal revisitings. The author has seen the tree said to  have been distorted by her in endeavouring to climb the fence; and has  visited the village and bridge, from which his descriptions are  accurately taken. The impression of her re-appearance is only  _poetically_ assumed, for there is too much of what Coleridge would term  \"the divinity of nature\" around Morton Bridge, to warrant its association  with supernatural mysteries.      Oh! sights are seen, and sounds are heard,      On Morton Bridge, at night,    When to the woods the cheerful birds      Have ta'en their silent flight.      When through the mantle of the sky      No cheering moonbeams delve,    And the far village clock hath told     The midnight hour of twelve.      Then o'er the lonely path is heard      The sigh of sable trees,    With deadly moan of suff'ring strife      Borne on the solemn breeze--      For Mary's spirit wanders there,      In snowy robe array'd,    To tell each trembling villager     Where sleeps the murder'd maid.      It was a Sabbath's eve of love,      When nature seem'd more holy;    And nought in life was dull, but she      Whose look was melancholy.      She lean'd her tear-stain'd cheek of health      Upon her lily arm,    Poor, hapless girl! she could not tell      What caus'd her wild alarm.      Around the roses of her face      Her flaxen ringlets fell;    No lovelier bosom than her own      Could guiltless sorrow swell!      The holy book before her lay,      That boon to mortals given,    To teach the way from weeping earth      To ever-glorious heaven;      And Mary read prophetic words,      That whisper'd of her doom--    \"Oh! they will search for me, but where      I am, they cannot come!\"      The tears forsook her gentle eyes,      And wet the sacred lore;    And such a terror shook her frame,      She ne'er had known before.      She ceas'd to weep, but deeper gloom      Her tearless musing brought;    And darker wan'd the evening hour,      And darker Mary's thought.      The sun, he set behind the hills,      And threw his fading fire    On mountain rock and village home,      And lit the distant spire.      (Sweet fane of truth and mercy! where      The tombs of other years    Discourse of virtuous life and hope,      And tell of by-gone tears!)      It was a night of nature's calm,      For earth and sky were still;    And childhood's revelry was o'er,     Upon the daisied hill.      The ale-house, with its gilded sign,      Hung on the beechen bough,    Was mute within, and tranquilly      The hamlet stream did flow.      The room where sat this grieving girl      Was one of ancient years;    Its antique state was well display'd      To conjure up her fears;      With massy walls of sable oak,      And roof of quaint design,    And lattic'd window, darkly hid      By rose and eglantine.      The summer moon now sweetly shone      All softly and serene;    She clos'd the casement tremblingly      Upon the beauteous scene.      Above that carved mantle hung,      Clad in the garb of gloom,    A painting of rich feudal state,--      An old baronial room.      The Norman windows scarcely cast      A light upon the wall,    Where shone the shields of warrior knights      Within the lonely hall.      And, pendent from each rusty nail,      Helmet and steely dress,    With bright and gilded morion,      To grace that dim recess.      Then Mary thought upon each tale      Of terrible romance:--    The lady in the lonely tower--      The murd'rer's deadly glance--      And moon-lit groves in pathless woods,      Where shadows nightly sped;    Her fancy could not leave the realms      Of darkness and the dead.      There stood a messenger without,      Beside her master's gate,    Who, till his thirsty horse had drunk,      Would hardly deign to wait.      The mansion rung with Mary's name,      For dreadful news he bore--    A dying mother wish'd to look      Upon her child once more.      The words were, \"Haste, ere life be gone;\"      Then was she quickly plac'd    Behind him on the hurrying steed,      Which soon the woods retrac'd.      Now they have pass'd o'er Morton Bridge,      While smil'd the moon above    Upon the ruffian and his prey--      The hawk and harmless dove.      The towering elms divide their tops;      And now a dismal heath    Proclaims her \"final doom\" is near      The awful hour of death!      The villain check'd his weary horse,      And spoke of trust betray'd;    And Mary's heart grew sick with fright,      As, answering, thus she said--      \"Oh! kill me not until I see      My mother's face again!    Ride on, in mercy, horseman, ride,      And let us reach the lane!      \"There slay me by my mother's door,      And I will pray for thee--    For she shall find her daughter's corse\"--      \"No, girl, it cannot be.      \"This heath thou shalt not cross, for soon      Its earth will hide thy form;    That babbling tongue of thine shall make      A morsel for the worm!\"      She leap'd upon the ling-clad heath,      And, nerv'd with phrensied fear,    Pursued her slippery way across,      Until the wood was near.      But nearer still _two_ fiends appear'd,      Like hunters of the fawn,    Who cast their cumb'ring cloaks away,      Beside that forest lone;      And bounded swifter than the maid,      Who nearly 'scap'd their wrath,    For well she knew that woody glade,      And every hoary path,      Obscur'd by oak and hazel bush,      Where milk-maid's merry song    Had often charm'd her lover's ear,      Who blest her silv'ry tongue.      But Mary miss'd the woodland stile--      The hedge-row was not high;    She gain'd its prickly top, and now      Her murderers were nigh.      A slender tree her fingers caught--      It bent beneath her weight;    'Twas false as love and Mary's fate!      Deceiving as the night!      She fell--and villagers relate      No more of Mary's hour,    But how she rose with deadly might,      And, with a maniac's power,      Fought with her murd'rers till they broke      Her slender arm in twain:    That none could e'er discover where      The maiden's corse was lain.      When wand'ring by that noiseless wood,      Forsaken by the bee,    Each rev'rend chronicler displays      The bent and treach'rous tree.      Pointing the barkless spot to view,      Which Mary's hand embrac'd,    They shake their hoary locks, and say,      \"It ne'er can be effac'd!\"    * * H.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.    _Tanning_.

At last he expired in  the arms of Maurocordato, whilst pronouncing the names of his daughter  and of Greece. His death was fatal to the nation, which it plunged in  mourning and tears.           *       *       *       *       *      MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.           *       *       *       *       *    CEREMONIES RELATING TO THE HAIR.    (_For the Mirror_.)      Among the ancient Greeks, all dead persons were thought to be under the  jurisdiction of the infernal deities, and therefore no man (says Potter)  could resign his life, till some of his hairs were cut to consecrate to  them. During the ceremony of laying out, clothing the dead, and sometimes  the interment itself, the hair of the deceased person was hung upon the  door, to signify the family was in mourning. It was sometimes laid upon  the dead body, sometimes cast into the funeral pile, and sometimes placed  upon the grave. Electra in Sophocles says, that Agamemnon had commanded  her and Chrysothemis to pay him this honour:--      \"With drink-off'rings and _locks_ of _hair_ we must,    According to his will, his _tomb_ adorn.\"    Candace in Ovid bewails her calamity, in that she was not permitted to  adorn her lover's tomb with her locks.    At Patroclus's funeral, the Grecians, to show their affection and  respect to him, covered his body with their hair; Achilles cast it into  the funeral pile. The custom of nourishing the hair on religious  accounts seems to have prevailed in most nations. Osiris, the Egyptian,  consecrated his hair to the gods, as we learn from Diodorus; and in  Arian's account of India, it appears it was a custom there to preserve  their hair for some god, which they first learnt (as that author  reports) from Bacchus.    The Greeks and Romans wore false hair. It was esteemed a peculiar honour  among the ancient Gauls to have long hair. For this reason Julius Caesar,  upon subduing the Gauls, made them cut off their hair, as a token of  submission. In the royal family of France, it was a long time the  peculiar mark and privilege of kings and princes of the blood to wear  long hair, artfully dressed and curled; every body else being obliged to  be polled, or cut round, in sign of inferiority and obedience. In the  eighth century, it was the custom of people of quality to have their  children's hair cut the first time by persons they had a particular  honour and esteem for, who, in virtue of this ceremony, were reputed a  sort of spiritual parents or godfathers to them. In the year 1096, there  was a canon, importing, that such as wore long hair should be excluded  coming into church when living, and not be prayed for when dead.  Charlemagne wore his hair very short, his son shorter; Charles the _Bald_  had none at all. Under Hugh Capet it began to appear again; this the  ecclesiastics were displeased with, and excommunicated all who let their  hair grow. Peter Lombard expostulated the matter so warmly with Charles  the Young, that he cut off his own hair; and his successors, for some  generations, wore it very short. A professor of Utrecht, in 1650, wrote  expressly on the question, Whether it be lawful for men to wear long  hair? and concluded for the negative. Another divine, named Reeves, who  had written for the affirmative, replied to him. In _New_ England a  declaration was inscribed in the register of the colony against the  practice of wearing long hair, which was principally levelled at the  Quakers, with unjust severity.

[Illustration: Pagoda in Kew Gardens.]      In one of the wildernesses of Kew Gardens stands the _Great Pagoda_,  erected in the year 1762, from a design in imitation of the Chinese Taa.  The base is a regular octagon, 49 feet in diameter; and the  superstructure is likewise a regular octagon on its plan, and in its  elevation composed of 10 prisms, which form the 10 different stories of  the building. The lowest of these is 26 feet in diameter, exclusive of  the portico which surrounds it, and 18 feet high; the second is 25 feet  in diameter, and 17 feet high; and all the rest diminish in diameter and  height, in the same arithmetical proportion, to the ninth story, which is  18 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. The tenth story is 17 feet in  diameter, and, with the covering, 20 feet high, and the finishing on the  top is 17 feet high; so that the whole structure, from the base to the  top of the fleuron, is 163 feet. Each story finishes with a projecting  roof, after the Chinese manner, covered with plates of varnished iron of  different colours, and round each of them is a gallery enclosed with a  rail. All the angles of the roof are adorned with large dragons, eighty  in number, covered with a kind of thin glass of various colours, which  produces a most dazzling reflection; and the whole ornament at the top is  double gilt. The walls of the building are composed of very hard bricks;  the outside of well-coloured and well-matched greystocks, (bricks,)  neatly laid. The staircase is in the centre of the building. The prospect  opens as you advance in height; and from the top you command a very  extensive view on all sides, and, in some directions, upwards of forty  miles distant, over a rich and variegated country.           *       *       *       *       *      FINE ARTS           *       *       *       *       *    MR. HAYDON'S PICTURE OF \"CHAIRING THE MEMBERS.\"      In our last volume we were induced to appropriate nearly six of our  columns to a description of Mr. Haydon's Picture of the Mock Election in  the King's Bench Prison--or rather _the first_ of a series of pictures to  illustrate the Election, the subject of the present notice being the  Second, or the Chairing of the Members, which was intended for the  concluding scene of the burlesque. It will, therefore, be unnecessary for  us here to give any additional explanation of the real life of these  paintings, except so far as may be necessary to the explanation of the  present picture.    The \"_Chairing_\" was acted on a water butt one evening, but was to have  been again performed in more magnificent costume the next day; just,  however, as all the actors in this eccentric masquerade, High Sheriff,  Lord Mayor, Head Constable, Assessor, Poll Clerks, and Members, were  ready dressed, and preparing to start, the marshal interfered, stopped  the procession, and, after some parley, was advised to send for the  guards.    \"About the middle of a sunny day,\" says Mr. Haydon, \"when all was quiet,  save the occasional cracking of a racket ball, while some were reading,  some smoking, some lounging, some talking, some occupied with their own  sorrows, and some with the sorrows of their friends, in rushed six fine  grenadiers with a noble fellow of a sergeant at their head, with bayonets  fixed, and several rounds of ball in their cartouches, expecting to meet  (by their looks) with the most desperate resistance.\"    \"The materials thus afforded me by the entrance of the guards, I have  combined in one moment;\" or \"I have combined in one moment what happened  at different moments; the _characters_ and _soldiers are all portraits_.  I have only used the poets and painters' license, to make out the second  part of the story, a part that happens in all elections, viz. the  chairing of the successful candidates.\"    \"In the corner of the picture, on the left of the spectator, are three  of the guards, drawn up across the door, standing at ease, with all the  self-command of soldiers in such situations, hardly suppressing a laugh  at the ridiculous attempts made to oppose them; in front of the guards,  is the commander of the enemy's forces; viz.--a little boy with a tin  sword, on regular guard position, ready to receive and oppose them, with  a banner of 'Freedom of Election,' hanging on his sabre; behind him  stands the Lord High Sheriff, affecting to charge the soldiers with his  mopstick and pottle. He is dressed in a magnificent suit of decayed  splendour, with an old court sword, loose silk stockings, white shoes,  and unbuckled knee-bands; his shoulders are adorned with white bows, and  curtain rings for a chain, hung by a blue ribbon from his neck. Next to  him, adorned with a blanket, is a character of voluptuous gaiety,  helmeted by a saucepan, holding up the cover for a shield, and a bottle  for a weapon. Then comes the Fool, making grimaces with his painted  cheeks, and bending his fists at the military; while the Lord Mayor with  his white wand, is placing his hand on his heart with mock gravity and  wounded indignation at this violation of _Magna Charta_ and civil  rights. Behind him are different characters, with a porter pot for a  standard, and a watchman's rattle; while in the extreme distance, behind  the rattle, and under the wall, is a ragged Orator addressing the  burgesses on this violation of the privileges of Election.    \"Right over the figure with a saucepan, is a Turnkey, holding up a key  and pulling down the celebrated Meredith; who, quite serious, and  believing he will really sit in the House, is endeavouring to strike the  turnkey with a champagne glass. The gallant member is on the shoulders of  two men, who are peeping out and quizzing.    \"Close to Meredith is his fellow Member, dressed in a Spanish hat and  feather, addressing the Sergeant opposite him, with an arch look, on the  illegality of his entrance at elections, while a turnkey has taken hold  of the member's robe, and is pulling him off the water butt with violence.    \"The sergeant, a fine soldier, one of the heroes of Waterloo, is smiling  and amused, while a grenadier, one of the other three under arms, is  looking at his sergeant for orders.    \"In the corner, directly under the sergeant, is a dissipated young man,  addicted to hunting"]]]
