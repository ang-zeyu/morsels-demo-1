A large fire at night is the life  and soul of such a party as ours, and when it blazed up at times, I could  not help observing that two of my Indians evinced uneasiness and want of  confidence in things around, as if they thought themselves usurpers on the  Red Indian territory. From time immemorial none of the Indians of the other  tribes had ever encamped near this lake fearlessly, and, as we had now  done, in the very centre of such a country; the lake and territory adjacent  having been always considered to belong exclusively to the Red Indians, and  to have been occupied by them. It had been our invariable practice  hitherto, to encamp near the hills, and be on their summits by the dawn of  day, to try to discover the morning smoke ascending from the Red Indians'  camps; and to prevent the discovery of ourselves, we extinguished our own  fire always some length of time before daylight.\"    \"Our only and frail hope now left of seeing the Red Indians, lay on the  banks of the River Exploits, on our return to the sea-coast.\"    \"The Red Indians' Lake discharges itself about three or four miles from its  north-east end, and its waters form the River Exploits. From the lake to  the sea-coast is considered about seventy miles; and down this noble river  the steady perseverance and intrepidity of my Indians carried me on rafts  in four days, to accomplish which otherwise, would have required, probably,  two weeks. We landed at various places on both banks of the river on our  way down, but found no traces of the Red Indians so recent as those seen at  the portage at Badger Bay-Great Lake, towards the beginning of our  excursion. During our descent, we had to construct new rafts at the  different waterfalls. Sometimes we were carried down the rapids at the rate  of ten miles an hour, or more, with considerable risk of destruction to the  whole party, for we were always together on one raft.\"    \"What arrests the attention most, while gliding down the stream, is the  extent of the Indian fences to entrap the deer. They extend from the lake  downwards, continuous, on the banks of the river, at least thirty miles.  There are openings left here and there in them, for the animals to go  through and swim across the river, and at these places the Indians are  stationed, and kill them in the water with spears, out of their canoes, as  at the lake. Here, then, connecting these fences with those on the  north-west side of the lake, is at least forty miles of country, easterly  and westerly, prepared to intercept all the deer that pass that way in  their periodical migrations. It was melancholy to contemplate the gigantic,  yet feeble, efforts of a whole primitive nation, in their anxiety to  provide subsistence, forsaken and going to decay.\"    \"There must have been hundreds of the Red Indians, and that not many years  ago, to have kept up these fences and pounds. As their numbers were  lessened so was their ability to keep them up for the purposes intended;  and now the deer pass the whole line unmolested.\"    \"We infer, that the few of these people who yet survive have taken refuge  in some sequestered spot, still in the northern part of the island, and  where they can procure deer to subsist on.\"    \"On the 29th of November we had again returned to the mouth of the River  Exploits, in thirty days after our departure from thence, after having made  a complete circuit of about 200 miles in the Red Indian territory.\"    \"In conclusion, I congratulate the institution on the acquisition of  several ingenious articles, the manufacture of the _Boeothicks_, or Red  Indians, some of which we had the good fortune to discover on our recent  excursion;--models of their canoes, bows and arrows, spears of different  kinds, &c.; and also a complete dress worn by that people. Their mode of  kindling fire is not only original, but, as far as we at present know, is  peculiar to the tribe. These articles, together with a short vocabulary of  their language, consisting of 200 or 300 words, which I have been enabled  to collect, prove the Boeothicks to be a distinct tribe from any hitherto  discovered in North America. One remarkable characteristic of their  language, and in which it resembles those of Europe more than any other  Indian languages do, with which we have had an opportunity of comparing  it,--is its abounding in diphthongs.\"    Mr. Cormack thinks that after the unfortunate circumstances attending past  encounters between the Europeans and the Red Indians, it is best now to  employ Indians belonging to the other tribes to be the medium of the  intercourse in view; and he has chosen three intelligent men from  Newfoundland to follow up the search.           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      DERWENTWATER.      The following touching episodal extract is from Dr. Southey's _Colloquies  on the Progress and Prospects of Society:_--The best general view of  Derwentwater is from the terrace, between Applethwaite and Milbeck, a  little beyond the former hamlet. The old roofs and chimneys of that hamlet  come finely in the foreground, and the trees upon the Ornathwaite estate  give there a richness to the middle ground, which is wanting in other parts  of the vale. From that spot I once saw three artists sketching it at the  same time--William Westall (who has engraved it among his admirable views  of Keswick,) Glover, and Edward Nash, my dear, kind-hearted friend and  fellow-traveller, whose death has darkened some of the blithest  recollections of my latter life. I know not from which of the surrounding  heights it is seen to most advantage; any one will amply repay the labour  of the ascent; and often as I have ascended them all, it has never been  without a fresh delight. The best near view is from a field adjoining  Friar's Craig. There it is that, if I had Aladdin's lamp, or Fortunatus's  purse (with leave of Greenwich Hospital be it spoken,) I would build myself  a house.    Thither I had strolled, on one of those first genial days of spring which  seem to affect the animal not less than the vegetable creation. At such  times even I, sedentary as I am, feel a craving for the open air and  sunshine, and creep out as instinctively as snails after a shower. Such  seasons, which have an exhilarating effect upon youth, produce a soothing  one when we are advanced in life. The root of an ash tree, on the bank  which bends round the little bay, had been half bared by the waters during  one of the winter floods, and afforded a commodious resting-place, whereon  I took my seat, at once basking in the sun and bathing, as it were, in the  vernal breeze. But delightful as all about me was to eye, and ear, and  feeling, it brought with it a natural reflection, that the scene which I  now beheld was the same which it had been and would continue to be, while  so many of those with whom I had formerly enjoyed it, were past away. Our  day-dreams become retrospective as we advance in years; and the heart feeds  as naturally upon remembrance in age as upon hope in youth.        \"Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?\"    I thought of her, whom I had so often seen plying her little skiff upon  that glassy water, the lady of the lake. It was like a poet's dream, or a  vision of romance, to behold her--and like a vision or a dream she had  departed!      \"O gentle Emma, o'er a lovelier form    Than thine, earth never closed; nor e'er did heaven    Receive a purer spirit from the world!\"    I thought of D., the most familiar of my friends during those years when we  lived near enough to each other for familiar intercourse--my friend, and  the friend of all who were dearest to me; a man, of whom all who knew him  will concur with me in saying, that they never knew, nor could conceive of  one more strictly dutiful, more actively benevolent, more truly kind, more  thoroughly good; the pleasantest companion, the sincerest counsellor, the  most considerate friend, the kindest host, the welcomest guest. After our  separation, he had visited me here three summers; with him it was that I  had first explored this land of lakes in all directions; and again and  again should we have retraced our steps in the wildest recesses of these  vales and mountains, and lived over the past again, if he had not, too  early for all who loved him,        \"Began the travel of eternity.\"    I called to mind my hopeful H----, too, so often the sweet companion of my  morning walks to this very spot; in whom I had fondly thought my better  part should have survived me, and      \"With whom it seemed my very life                  Went half away!    But we shall meet--but we shall meet    Where parting tears shall never flow;    And when I think thereon, almost                  I long to go!\"    \"Thy dead shall live, O Lord; together with my dead body shall they arise.  Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust! for Thy dew is as the dew of herbs;  and the earth shall cast out her dead!\"    Surely, to the sincere believer death would be an object of desire instead  of dread, were it not for those ties--those heartstrings--by which we are  attached to life. Nor, indeed, do I believe that it is natural to fear  death, however generally it may be thought so. From my own feelings I have  little right to judge; for, although habitually mindful that the hour  cometh, and even now may be, it has never appeared actually near enough to  make me duly apprehend its effect upon myself. But from what I have  observed, and what I have heard those persons say whose professions lead  them to the dying, I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#4)"],[1,"e, looked about him.    He had plenty to occupy his attention in the faces round him. He  furtively examined Mr. Gordon, as he bent over his high desk, writing,  but couldn't make our the physiognomy. There had been something reserved  and imperious in the master's manner, yet he thought he should not  dislike him on the whole. With the countenances of his future  schoolfellows he was not altogether pleased, but there were one or two  which thoroughly attracted him. One boy, whose side face was turned  towards him as he sat on the bench in front, took his fancy  particularly, so, tired of doing nothing, he plucked up courage, and  leaning forward whispered, \"Do lend me your Cesar for a few minutes.\"  The boy at once handed it to him with a pleasant smile, and as the  lesson was marked, Eric had time to hurry over a few sentences, when Mr.  Gordon's sonorous voice exclaimed,    \"Fourth form, come up!\"    Some twenty of the boys went up, and stood in a large semicircle round  the desk. Eric of course was placed last, and the lesson commenced.    \"Russell, begin,\" said the master; and immediately the boy who had  handed Eric his Caesar, began reading a few sentences, and construed  them very creditably, only losing a place or two. He had a frank open  face, bright intelligent fearless eyes, and a very taking voice and  manner. Eric listened admiringly and felt sure he should like him.    Barker was put on next. He bungled through the Latin in a grating  irresolute sort of a way, with several false quantities, for each of  which the next boy took him up. Then he began to construe;--a frightful  confusion of nominatives without verbs, accusatives translated as  ablatives, and perfects turned into prepositions ensued, and after a  hopeless flounder, during which Mr. Gordon left him entirely to himself,  Barker came to a full stop; his catastrophe was so ludicrous, that Eric  could not help joining in the general titter Barker scowled.    \"As usual, Barker,\" said the master, with a curl of the lip. \"Hold out  your hand!\"    Barker did so, looking sullen defiance, and the cane immediately  descended on his open palm. Six similar cuts followed, during which the  form looked on, not without terror; and Barker, squeezing his hands  tight together, went back to his seat.    \"Williams, translate the piece in which Barker has just failed!\"    Eric did as he was bid, and got through it pretty well. He had now quite  recovered his ordinary bearing, and spoke out clearly and without  nervousness. He afterwards won several places by answering questions,  and at the end of the lesson was marked about half-way up the form. The  boys' numbers were then taken down in the weekly register, and they went  back to their seats.    On his desk Eric found a torn bit of paper, on which was clumsily  scrawled, \"I'll teach you to grin when I'm turned, you young brute.\"    The paper seemed to fascinate his eyes. He stared at it fixedly, and  augured ominously of Barker's intentions, since that worthy obviously  alluded to his having smiled in form, and chose to interpret it as an  intentional provocation. He felt that he was in for it, and that Barker  meant to pick a quarrel with him. This puzzled and annoyed him, and he  felt very sad to have found an enemy already.    While he was looking at the paper, the great school-clock struck twelve;  and the captain of the form getting up, threw open the folding-doors of  the school-room.    \"You may go,\" said Mr. Gordon; and leaving his seat disappeared by a  door at the further end of the room.    Instantly there was a rash for caps, and the boys poured out in a  confused and noisy stream, while at the same moment the other  school-rooms disgorged their inmates. Eric naturally went out among the  last; but just as he was going to take his cap, Barker seized it, and  flung it with a whoop to the end of the passage, where it was trampled  on by a number of the boys as they ran out.    Eric, gulping down his fury with a great effort, turned to his opponent,  and said coolly, \"Is that what you always do to new fellows?\"    \"Yes, you bumptious young owl, it is, and that too;\" and a tolerably  smart slap on the face followed--leaving a red mark on a cheek already  aflame with, anger and indignation,--\"should you like a little more?\"    He was hurt, both mind and body, but was too proud to cry. \"What's that  for?\" he said, with flashing eyes.    \"For your conceit in laughing at me when I was caned.\"    Eric stamped. \"I did nothing of the kind, and you know it as well as I  do.\"    \"What! I'm a liar, am I? O we shall take this kind of thing out of you,  you young cub--take that;\" and a heavier blow followed.    \"You brutal cowardly bully,\" shouted Eric; and in another moment he  would have sprung upon him. It was lucky for him that he did not, for  Barker was three years older than he, and very powerful. Such an attack  would hare been most unfortunate for him in every way. But at this  instant some boys hearing the quarrel ran up, and Russell among them.    \"Hallo, Barker,\" said one, \"what's up?\"    \"Why, I'm teaching this new fry to be less bumptious, that's all.\"    \"Shame!\" said Russell, as he saw the mark on Eric's cheek; \"what a  fellow you are, Barker. Why couldn't you leave him alone for his first  day, at any rate?\"    \"What's that to you? I'll kick you too, if you say much.\"    \"Cave, cave!\" whispered half a dozen voices, and instantly the knot of  boys dispersed in every direction, as Mr. Gordon was seen approaching.  He had caught a glimpse of the scene without understanding it, and  seeing the new boy's red and angry face, he only said, as he passed by,  \"What, Williams! fighting already? Take care.\"    This was the cruellest cut of all. \"So,\" thought Eric, \"a nice  beginning! it seems both boys and masters are against me;\" and very  disconsolately he walked to pick up his cap.    The boys were all dispersed in the play-ground at different games, and  as he went home he was stopped perpetually, and had to answer the usual  questions, \"What's your name? Are you a boarder or a day scholar? What  form are you in?\" Eric expected all this, and it therefore did not annoy  him. Under any other circumstances, he would have answered cheerfully  and frankly enough; but now he felt miserable at his morning's  rencontre, and his answers were short and sheepish, his only desire  being to get away as soon as possible. It was an additional vexation to  feel sure that his manner did not make a favorable impression.    Before he had got out of the play ground, Russell ran up to him. \"I'm  afraid you won't like this, or think much of us, Williams,\" he said.  \"But never mind. It'll only last a day or two, and the fellows are not  so bad as they seem; except that Barker. I'm sorry you've come across  him, but it can't be helped.\"    It was the first kind word he had had since the morning, and after his  troubles kindness melted him. He felt half inclined to cry, and for a  few moments could say nothing in reply to Russell's soothing words. But  the boy's friendliness went far to comfort him, and at last, shaking  hands with him, he said--    \"Do let me speak to you sometimes, while I am a new boy, Russell.\"    \"O yes,\" said Russell, laughing, \"as much as ever you like. And as  Barker hates me pretty much as he seems inclined to hate you, we are in  the same box. Good bye.\"    So Eric left the field, and wandered home, like Calchas in the Iliad,  \"Sorrowful by the side of the sounding sea.\" Already the purple mantle  had fallen from his ideal of schoolboy life. He got home later than they  expected, and found his parents waiting for him. It was rather  disappointing to them to see his face so melancholy, when they expected  him to be full of animation and pleasure. Mrs. Williams drew her own  conclusions from the red mark on his cheek, as well as the traces of  tears welling to his eyes; but, like a wise mother, she asked nothing,  and left the boy to tell his own story,--which, in time he did, omitting  all the painful part, speaking enthusiastically of Russell, and only  admitting that he had been a little teased.        CHAPTER III    BULLYING    \"Give to the morn of life its natural blessedness.\" Wordsworth.    Why is it that new boys are almost invariably ill-treated? I have often  fancied that there must be in boyhood a pseudo-instinctive cruelty, a  sort of \"wild trick of the ancestral savage,\" which, no amount of  civilization can entirely repress. Certain it is, that to most boys the  first term is a trying ordeal. They are being tested and weighed. Their  place in the general estimation is not yet fixed, and the slightest  circumstances are seized upon to settle the category under which the boy  is to be classed. A few apparently trivial accidents of his first few  weeks at school often decide his position in the general regard for the  remainder of his boyhood. And yet these are _not_ accidents; they are  the slight indications which give an unerring proof of the general  tendencies of his character and training. Hence much of the apparent  cruelty with which new boys are treated is not exactly intentional. At  first, of course, as they can have no friends worth speaking of, there  are always plenty of coarse and brutal minds that take a pleasure in  their torment, particularly if they at once recognise any innate  superiority to themselves. Of this class was Barker. He hated Eric at  first sight, simply because his feeble mind could only realise one idea  about him, and that was the new boy's striking contrast with his own  imperfections. Hence he left no means untried to vent on Eric his low  and mean jealousy. He showed undisguised pleasure when he fell in form,  and signs of disgust when he rose; he fomented every little source of  disapproval or quarrelling which happened to arise against him; he never  looked at him without a frown or a sneer; he waited for him to kick and  annoy him as he came "]]]
