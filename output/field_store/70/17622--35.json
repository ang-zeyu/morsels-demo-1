The thumb having been thus prepared, he squeezed out a  drop of the thick ink on to the copper plate and spread it out with the  roller, testing the condition of the film from time to time by touching  the plate with the tip of his finger and taking an impression on one of  the cards.    When the ink had been rolled out to the requisite thinness, he took  Reuben's hand and pressed the thumb lightly but firmly on to the inked  plate; then, transferring the thumb to one of the cards, which he  directed me to hold steady on the table, he repeated the pressure, when  there was left on the card a beautifully sharp and clear impression of  the bulb of the thumb, the tiny papillary ridges being shown with  microscopic distinctness, and even the mouths of the sweat glands, which  appeared as rows of little white dots on the black lines of the ridges.  This manoeuvre was repeated a dozen times on two of the cards, each of  which thus received six impressions. Thorndyke then took one or two  rolled prints, _i.e._ prints produced by rolling the thumb first on the  inked slab and then on the card, by which means a much larger portion of  the surface of the thumb was displayed in a single print.    \"And now,\" said Thorndyke, \"that we may be furnished with all the  necessary means of comparison, we will take an impression in blood.\"    The thumb was accordingly cleansed and dried afresh, when Thorndyke,  having pricked his own thumb with a needle, squeezed out a good-sized  drop of blood on to a card.    \"There,\" said he, with a smile, as he spread the drop out with the  needle into a little shallow pool, \"it is not every lawyer who is  willing to shed his blood in the interests of his client.\"    He proceeded to make a dozen prints as before on two cards, writing a  number with his pencil opposite each print as he made it.    \"We are now,\" said he, as he finally cleansed his client's thumb,  \"furnished with the material for a preliminary investigation, and if you  will now give me your address, Mr. Hornby, we may consider our business  concluded for the present. I must apologise to you, Mr. Lawley, for  having detained you so long with these experiments.\"    The lawyer had, in fact, been viewing the proceedings with hardly  concealed impatience, and he now rose with evident relief that they  were at an end.    \"I have been highly interested,\" he said mendaciously, \"though I confess  I do not quite fathom your intentions. And, by the way, I should like to  have a few words with you on another matter, if Mr. Reuben would not  mind waiting for me in the square just a few minutes.\"    \"Not at all,\" said Reuben, who was, I perceived, in no way deceived by  the lawyer's pretence. \"Don't hurry on my account; my time is my own--at  present.\" He held out his hand to Thorndyke, who grasped it cordially.    \"Good-bye, Mr. Hornby,\" said the latter. \"Do not be unreasonably  sanguine, but at the same time, do not lose heart. Keep your wits about  you and let me know at once if anything occurs to you that may have a  bearing on the case.\"    The young man then took his leave, and, as the door closed after him,  Mr. Lawley turned towards Thorndyke.    \"I thought I had better have a word with you alone,\" he said, \"just to  hear what line you propose to take up, for I confess that your attitude  has puzzled me completely.\"    \"What line would you propose?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Well,\" said the lawyer, with a shrug of his shoulders, \"the position  seems to be this: our young friend has stolen a parcel of diamonds and  has been found out; at least, that is how the matter presents itself to  me.\"    \"That is not how it presents itself to me,\" said Thorndyke drily. \"He  may have taken the diamonds or he may not. I have no means of judging  until I have sifted the evidence and acquired a few more facts. This I  hope to do in the course of the next day or two, and I suggest that we  postpone the consideration of our plan of campaign until I have seen  what line of defence it is possible to adopt.\"    \"As you will,\" replied the lawyer, taking up his hat, \"but I am afraid  you are encouraging the young rogue to entertain hopes that will only  make his fall the harder--to say nothing of our own position. We don't  want to make ourselves ridiculous in court, you know.\"    \"I don't, certainly,\" agreed Thorndyke. \"However, I will look into the  matter and communicate with you in the course of a day or two.\"    He stood holding the door open as the lawyer descended the stairs, and  when the footsteps at length died away, he closed it sharply and turned  to me with an air of annoyance.    \"The 'young rogue,'\" he remarked, \"does not appear to me to have been  very happy in his choice of a solicitor. By the way, Jervis, I  understand you are out of employment just now?\"    \"That is so,\" I answered.    \"Would you care to help me--as a matter of business, of course--to work  up this case? I have a lot of other work on hand and your assistance  would be of great value to me.\"    I said, with great truth, that I should be delighted.    \"Then,\" said Thorndyke, \"come round to breakfast to-morrow and we will  settle the terms, and you can commence your duties at once. And now let  us light our pipes and finish our yarns as though agitated clients and  thick-headed solicitors had no existence.\"          CHAPTER III    A LADY IN THE CASE      When I arrived at Thorndyke's chambers on the following morning, I found  my friend already hard at work. Breakfast was laid at one end of the  table, while at the other stood a microscope of the pattern used for  examining plate-cultures of micro-organisms, on the wide stage of which  was one of the cards bearing six thumb-prints in blood. A condenser  threw a bright spot of light on the card, which Thorndyke had been  examining when I knocked, as I gathered from the position of the chair,  which he now pushed back against the wall.    \"I see you have commenced work on our problem,\" I remarked as, in  response to a double ring of the electric bell, Polton entered with the  materials for our repast.    \"Yes,\" answered Thorndyke. \"I have opened the campaign, supported, as  usual, by my trusty chief-of-staff; eh! Polton?\"    The little man, whose intellectual, refined countenance and dignified  bearing seemed oddly out of character with the tea-tray that he carried,  smiled proudly, and, with a glance of affectionate admiration at my  friend, replied--    \"Yes, sir. We haven't been letting the grass grow under our feet.  There's a beautiful negative washing upstairs and a bromide enlargement  too, which will be mounted and dried by the time you have finished your  breakfast.\"    \"A wonderful man that, Jervis,\" my friend observed as his assistant  retired. \"Looks like a rural dean or a chancery judge, and was obviously  intended by Nature to be a professor of physics. As an actual fact he  was first a watchmaker, then a maker of optical instruments, and now he  is mechanical factotum to a medical jurist. He is my right-hand, is  Polton; takes an idea before you have time to utter it--but you will  make his more intimate acquaintance by-and-by.\"    \"Where did you pick him up?\" I asked.    \"He was an in-patient at the hospital when I first met him, miserably  ill and broken, a victim of poverty and undeserved misfortune. I gave  him one or two little jobs, and when I found what class of man he was I  took him permanently into my service. He is perfectly devoted to me, and  his gratitude is as boundless as it is uncalled for.\"    \"What are the photographs he was referring to?\" I asked.    \"He is making an enlarged _facsimile_ of one of the thumb-prints on  bromide paper and a negative of the same size in case we want the print  repeated.\"    \"You evidently have some expectation of being able to help poor Hornby,\"  said I, \"though I cannot imagine how you propose to go to work. To me  his case seems as hopeless a one as it is possible to conceive. One  doesn't like to condemn him, but yet his innocence seems almost  unthinkable.\"    \"It does certainly look like a hopeless case,\" Thorndyke agreed, \"and I  see no way out of it at present. But I make it a rule, in all cases, to  proceed on the strictly classical lines of inductive inquiry--collect  facts, make hypotheses, test them and seek for verification. And I  always endeavour to keep a perfectly open mind.    \"Now, in the present case, assuming, as we must, that the robbery has  actually taken place, there are four conceivable hypotheses: (1) that  the robbery was committed by Reuben Hornby; (2) that it was committed by  Walter Hornby; (3) that it was committed by John Hornby, or (4) that it  was committed by some other person or persons.    \"The last hypothesis I propose to disregard for the present and confine  myself to the examination of the other three.\"    \"You don't think it possible that Mr. Hornby could have stolen the  diamonds out of his own safe?\" I exclaimed.    \"I incline at present to no one theory of the matter,\" replied  Thorndyke. \"I merely state the hypotheses. John Hornby had access to the  diamonds, therefore it is possible that he stole them.\"    \"But surely he was responsible to the owners.\"    \"Not in the absence of gross negligence, which the owners would have  difficulty in proving. You see, he was what is called a gratuitous  bailee, and in such a case no responsibility for loss lies with the  bailee unless there has been gross negligence.\"    \"But the thumb-mark, my dear fellow!\" I exclaimed. \"How can you possibly  get over that?\"    \"I don't know that I can,\" answered Thorndyke calmly; \"but I see you are  taking the same view as the police, who persist in regarding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#4)"],[1," enterprise I was beginning to view apart from its  inspiration, on its intrinsic demerits, and the more clearly I saw it in  its own light, the less pleasure did the prospect afford me.    A young giant, whom I had not seen since his childhood, was merely  understood to be carrying on a conspicuous, but in all probability the  most innocent, flirtation in a Swiss hotel; and here was I, on mere  second-hand hearsay, crossing half Europe to spoil his perfectly  legitimate sport! I did not examine my project from the unknown lady's  point of view; it made me quite hot enough to consider it from that of  my own sex. Yet, the day before yesterday, I had more than acquiesced  in the dubious plan. I had even volunteered for its achievement. The  train rattled out one long, maddening tune to my own incessant  marvellings at my own secret apostasy: the stuffy compartment was not  Catherine's sanctum of the quickening memorials and the olden spell.  Catherine herself was no longer before me in the vivacious flesh, with  her half playful pathos of word and look, her fascinating outward light  and shade, her deeper and steadier intellectual glow. Those, I suppose,  were the charms which had undone me, first as well as last; but the  memory of them was no solace in the train. Nor was I tempted to dream  again of ultimate reward. I could see now no further than my immediate  part, and a more distasteful mixture of the mean and of the ludicrous I  hope never to rehearse again.    One mitigation I might have set against the rest. Dining at the Rag the  night before I left, I met a man who knew a man then staying at the  Riffel Alp. My man was a sapper with whom I had had a very slight  acquaintance out in India, but he happened to be one of those  good-natured creatures who never hesitate to bestir themselves or their  friends to oblige a mere acquaintance: he asked if I had secured rooms,  and on learning that I had not, insisted on telegraphing to his friend  to do his best for me. I had not hitherto appreciated the popularity of  a resort which I happened only to know by name, nor did I even on  getting at Lausanne a telegram to say that a room was duly reserved for  me. It was only when I actually arrived, tired out with travel, toward  the second evening, and when half of those who had come up with me were  sent down again to Zermatt for their pains, that I felt as grateful as I  ought to have been from the beginning. Here upon a mere ledge of the  High Alps was a hotel with tier upon tier of windows winking in the  setting sun. On every hand were dazzling peaks piled against a turquoise  sky, yet drawn respectfully apart from the incomparable Matterhorn, that  proud grim chieftain of them all. The grand spectacle and the magic air  made me thankful to be there, if only for their sake, albeit the more  regretful that a purer purpose had not drawn me to so fine a spot.    My unknown friend at court, one Quinby, a civilian, came up and spoke  before I had been five minutes at my destination. He was a very tall and  extraordinarily thin man, with an ill-nourished red moustache, and an  easy geniality of a somewhat acid sort. He had a trick of laughing  softly through his nose, and my two sticks served to excite a sense of  humour as odd as its habitual expression.    \"I'm glad you carry the outward signs,\" said he, \"for I made the most of  your wounds and you really owe your room to them. You see, we're a very  representative crowd. That festive old boy, strutting up and down with  his cigar, in the Panama hat, is really best known in the black cap:  it's old Sankey, the hanging judge. The big man with his back turned you  will know in a moment when he looks this way: it's our celebrated friend  Belgrave Teale. He comes down in one or other of his parts every day:  to-day it's the genial squire, yesterday it was the haw-haw officer of  the Crimean school. But a real live officer from the Front we don't  happen to have had, much less a wounded one, and you limp straight into  the breach.\"    I should have resented these pleasantries from an ordinary stranger, but  this libertine might be held to have earned his charter, and moreover I  had further use for him. We were loitering on the steps between the  glass veranda and the terrace at the back of the hotel. The little  sunlit stage was full of vivid, trivial, transitory life, it seemed as a  foil to the vast eternal scene. The hanging judge still strutted with  his cigar, peering jocosely from under the broad brim of his Panama; the  great actor still posed aloof, the human Matterhorn of the group. I  descried no showy woman with a tall youth dancing attendance; among the  brick-red English faces there was not one that bore the least  resemblance to the latest photograph of Bob Evers.    A little consideration suggested my first move.    \"I think I saw a visitors' book in the hall,\" I said. \"I may as well  stick down my name.\"    But before doing so I ran my eye up and down the pages inscribed by  those who had arrived that month.    \"See anybody you know?\" inquired Quinby, who hovered obligingly at my  elbow. It was really necessary to be as disingenuous as possible, more  especially with a person whose own conversation was evidently quite  unguarded.    \"Yes, by Jove I do! Robin Evers, of all people!\"    \"Do you know him?\"    The question came pretty quickly. I was sorry I had said so much.    \"Well, I once knew a small boy of that name; but then they are not a  small clan.\"    \"His mother's the Honourable,\" said Quinby, with studious unconcern, yet  I fancied with increased interest in me.    \"I used to see something of them both,\" I deliberately admitted, \"when  the lad was little. How has he turned out?\"    Quinby gave his peculiar nasal laugh.    \"A nice youth,\" said he. \"A very nice youth!\"    \"Do you mean nice or nasty?\" I asked, inclined to bridle at his tone.    \"Oh, anything but nasty,\" said Quinby. \"Only--well--perhaps a bit rapid  for his years!\"    I stooped and put my name in the book before making any further remark.  Then I handed Quinby my cigarette-case, and we sat down on the nearest  lounge.    \"Rapid, is he?\" said I. \"That's quite interesting. And how does it take  him?\"    \"Oh, not in any way that's discreditable; but as a matter of fact,  there's a gay young widow here, and they're fairly going it!\"    I lit my cigarette with a certain unexpected sense of downright  satisfaction. So there was something in it after all. It had seemed such  a fool's errand in the train.    \"A young widow,\" I repeated, emphasising one of Quinby's epithets and  ignoring the other.    \"I mean, of course, she's a good deal older than Evers.\"    \"And her name?\"    \"A Mrs. Lascelles.\"    I nodded.    \"Do you happen to know anything about her, Captain Clephane?\"    \"I can't say I do.\"    \"No more does anybody else,\" said Quinby, \"except that she's an Indian  widow of sorts.\"    \"Indian!\" I repeated with more interest.    Quinby looked at me.    \"You've been out there yourself, perhaps?\"    \"It was there I knew Hamilton,\" said I, naming our common friend in the  Engineers.    \"Yet you're sure you never came across Mrs. Lascelles there?\"    \"India's a large place,\" I said, smiling as I shook my head.    \"I wonder if Hamilton did,\" speculated Quinby aloud.    \"And the Lascelleses,\" I added, \"are another large clan.\"    \"Well,\" he went on, after a moment's further cogitation, \"there's nobody  here can place this particular Mrs. Lascelles; but there are some who  say things which they can tell you themselves. I'm not going to repeat  them if you know anything about the boy. I only wish you knew him well  enough to give him a friendly word of advice!\"    \"Is it so bad as all that?\"    \"My dear sir, I don't say there's anything bad about it,\" returned  Quinby, who seemed to possess a pretty gift of suggestive negation. \"But  you may hear another opinion from other people, for you will find that  the whole hotel is talking about it. No,\" he went on, watching my eyes,  \"it's no use looking for them at this time of day; they disappear from  morning to night; if you want to see them you must take a stroll when  everybody else is thinking of turning in. Then you may have better luck.  But here are the letters at last.\"    The concierge had appeared, hugging an overflowing armful of postal  matter. In another minute there was hardly standing room in the little  hall. My companion uttered his unlovely laugh.    \"And here comes the British lion roaring for his London papers! It isn't  his letters he's so keen on, if you notice, Captain Clephane; it's his  _Daily Mail_, with the latest cricket, and after that the war. Teale is  an exception, of course. He has a stack of press-cuttings every day.  You will see him gloating over them in a minute. Ah! the old judge has  got his _Sportsman_; he reads nothing else except the _Sporting Times_,  and he's going back for the Leger. Do you see the man with the blue  spectacles and the peeled nose? He was last Vice Chancellor but one at  Cambridge. No, that's not a Bishop, it's an Archdeacon. All we want is a  Cabinet Minister now; every evening there is a rumour that the Colonial  Secretary is on his way, and most mornings you will hear that he has  actually arrived under cloud of night.\"    The facetious Quinby did not confine his more or less caustic commentary  to the well-known folk of whom there seemed no dearth; in the ten or  twenty minutes that we sat together he further revealed himself as a  copious gossip, with a wide net alike for the big fish and for the  smallest fry. There was a sheepish gentleman with a twitching face, and  a shaven cleric in close attendance; the former a rich brand plucked  from burning by the latter, whose temporal reward was the present trip,  so Quinby assured me during the time it took them to pass before our  eyes through the now emptying hall.
