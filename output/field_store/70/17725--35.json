One night, during a heavy fall of snow, when the whole world  was hushed, and peaceful men were stretched in sleep upon the mats,  the Ronins determined that no more favourable opportunity could occur  for carrying out their purpose. So they took counsel together, and,  having divided their band into two parties, assigned to each man his  post. One band, led by Oishi Kuranosuke, was to attack the front gate,  and the other, under his son Oishi Chikara, was to attack the postern  of Kotsuke no Suke's house; but as Chikara was only sixteen years of  age, Yoshida Chiuzayemon was appointed to act as his guardian. Further  it was arranged that a drum, beaten at the order of Kuranosuke, should  be the signal for the simultaneous attack; and that if any one slew  Kotsuke no Suke and cut off his head he should blow a shrill whistle,  as a signal to his comrades, who would hurry to the spot, and, having  identified the head, carry it off to the temple called Sengakuji, and  lay it as an offering before the tomb of their dead lord. Then they  must report their deed to the Government, and await the sentence of  death which would surely be passed upon them. To this the Ronins one  and all pledged themselves. Midnight was fixed upon as the hour, and  the forty-seven comrades, having made all ready for the attack,  partook of a last farewell feast together, for on the morrow they must  die. Then Oishi Kuranosuke addressed the band, and said--    \"To-night we shall attack our enemy in his palace; his retainers will  certainly resist us, and we shall be obliged to kill them. But to slay  old men and women and children is a pitiful thing; therefore, I pray  you each one to take great heed lest you kill a single helpless  person.\" His comrades all applauded this speech, and so they remained,  waiting for the hour of midnight to arrive.    When the appointed hour came, the Ronins set forth. The wind howled  furiously, and the driving snow beat in their faces; but little cared  they for wind or snow as they hurried on their road, eager for  revenge. At last they reached Kotsuke no Suke's house, and divided  themselves into two bands; and Chikara, with twenty-three men, went  round to the back gate. Then four men, by means of a ladder of ropes  which they hung on to the roof of the porch, effected an entry into  the courtyard; and, as they saw signs that all the inmates of the  house were asleep, they went into the porter's lodge where the guard  slept, and, before the latter had time to recover from their  astonishment, bound them. The terrified guard prayed hard for mercy,  that their lives might be spared; and to this the Ronins agreed on  condition that the keys of the gate should be given up; but the others  tremblingly said that the keys were kept in the house of one of their  officers, and that they had no means of obtaining them. Then the  Ronins lost patience, and with a hammer dashed in pieces the big  wooden bolt which secured the gate, and the doors flew open to the  right and to the left. At the same time Chikara and his party broke in  by the back gate.    Then Oishi Kuranosuke sent a messenger to the neighbouring houses,  bearing the following message:--\"We, the Ronins who were formerly in  the service of Asano Takumi no Kami, are this night about to break  into the palace of Kotsuke no Suke, to avenge our lord. As we are  neither night robbers nor ruffians, no hurt will be done to the  neighbouring houses. We pray you to set your minds at rest.\" And as  Kotsuke no Suke was hated by his neighbours for his covetousness, they  did not unite their forces to assist him. Another precaution was yet  taken. Lest any of the people inside should run out to call the  relations of the family to the rescue, and these coming in force  should interfere with the plans of the Ronins, Kuranosuke stationed  ten of his men armed with bows on the roof of the four sides of the  courtyard, with orders to shoot any retainers who might attempt to  leave the place. Having thus laid all his plans and posted his men,  Kuranosuke with his own hand beat the drum and gave the signal for  attack.    Ten of Kotsuke no Suke's retainers, hearing the noise, woke up; and,  drawing their swords, rushed into the front room to defend their  master. At this moment the Ronins, who had burst open the door of the  front hall, entered the same room. Then arose a furious fight between  the two parties, in the midst of which Chikara, leading his men  through the garden, broke into the back of the house; and Kotsuke no  Suke, in terror of his life, took refuge, with his wife and female  servants, in a closet in the verandah; while the rest of his  retainers, who slept in the barrack outside the house, made ready to  go to the rescue. But the Ronins who had come in by the front door,  and were fighting with the ten retainers, ended by overpowering and  slaying the latter without losing one of their own number; after  which, forcing their way bravely towards the back rooms, they were  joined by Chikara and his men, and the two bands were united in one.    By this time the remainder of Kotsuke no Suke's men had come in, and  the fight became general; and Kuranosuke, sitting on a camp-stool,  gave his orders and directed the Ronins. Soon the inmates of the house  perceived that they were no match for their enemy, so they tried to  send out intelligence of their plight to Uyesugi Sama, their lord's  father-in-law, begging him to come to the rescue with all the force  at his command. But the messengers were shot down by the archers whom  Kuranosuke had posted on the roof. So no help coming, they fought on  in despair. Then Kuranosuke cried out with a loud voice: \"Kotsuke no  Suke alone is our enemy; let some one go inside and bring him forth.  dead or alive!\"    Now in front of Kotsuke no Suke's private room stood three brave  retainers with drawn swords. The first was Kobayashi Hehachi, the  second was Waku Handaiyu, and the third was Shimidzu Ikkaku, all good  men and true, and expert swordsmen. So stoutly did these men lay about  them that for a while they kept the whole of the Ronins at bay, and at  one moment even forced them back. When Oishi Kuranosuke saw this, he  ground his teeth with rage, and shouted to his men: \"What! did not  every man of you swear to lay down his life in avenging his lord, and  now are you driven back by three men? Cowards, not fit to be spoken  to! to die fighting in a master's cause should be the noblest ambition  of a retainer!\" Then turning to his own son Chikara, he said, \"Here,  boy! engage those men, and if they are too strong for you, die!\"    Spurred by these words, Chikara seized a spear and gave battle to Waku  Handaiyu, but could not hold his ground, and backing by degrees, was  driven out into the garden, where he missed his footing and slipped  into a pond, but as Handaiyu, thinking to kill him, looked down into  the pond, Chikara cut his enemy in the leg and caused him to fall, and  then, crawling out of the water dispatched him. In the meanwhile  Kobayashi Hehachi and Shimidzu Ikkaku had been killed by the other  Ronins, and of all Kotsuke no Suke's retainers not one fighting man  remained. Chikara, seeing this, went with his bloody sword in his hand  into a back room to search for Kotsuke no Suke, but he only found the  son of the latter, a young lord named Kira Sahioye, who, carrying a  halberd, attacked him, but was soon wounded and fled. Thus the whole  of Kotsuke no Suke's men having been killed, there was an end of the  fighting; but as yet there was no trace of Kotsuke no Suke to be  found.    Then Kuranosuke divided his men into several parties and searched the  whole house, but all in vain; women and children weeping were alone to  be seen. At this the forty-seven men began to lose heart in regret,  that after all their toil they had allowed their enemy to escape them,  and there was a moment when in their despair they agreed to commit  suicide together upon the spot; but they determined to make one more  effort. So Kuranosuke went into Kotsuke no Suke's sleeping-room, and  touching the quilt with his hands, exclaimed, \"I have just felt the  bed-clothes and they are yet warm, and so methinks that our enemy is  not far off. He must certainly be hidden somewhere in the house.\"  Greatly excited by this, the Ronins renewed their search. Now in the  raised part of the room, near the place of honour, there was a picture  hanging; taking down this picture, they saw that there was a large  hole in the plastered wall, and on thrusting a spear in they could  feel nothing beyond it. So one of the Ronins, called Yazama Jiutaro,  got into the hole, and found that on the other side there was a little  courtyard, in which there stood an outhouse for holding charcoal and  firewood. Looking into the outhouse, he spied something white at the  further end, at which he struck with his spear, when two armed men  sprang out upon him and tried to cut him down, but he kept them back  until one of his comrades came up and killed one of the two men and  engaged the other, while Jiutaro entered the outhouse and felt about  with his spear. Again seeing something white, he struck it with his  lance, when a cry of pain betrayed that it was a man; so he rushed up,  and the man in white clothes, who had been wounded in the thigh, drew  a dirk and aimed a blow at him. But Jiutaro wrested the dirk from him,  and clutching him by the collar, dragged him out of the outhouse. Then  the other Ronin came up, and they examined the prisoner attentively,  and saw that he was a noble-looking man, some sixty years of age,  dressed in a white satin sleeping-robe, which was stained by the blood  from the thigh-wound which, Jiutaro had inflicted. The two men felt  convinced that this was no other than Kotsuke no Suke, and they asked  him his name, but he gave no answer, so they gave the signal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#4)"],[1,"that,  after all, gas is not so much the enemy of the book itself as of its  covering; but then, re-binding always leaves a book smaller, and often  deprives it of leaves at the beginning or end, which the binder's wisdom  has thought useless. Oh! the havoc I have seen committed by binders.  You may assume your most impressive aspect--you may write down your  instructions as if you were making your last will and testament--you may  swear you will not pay if your books are ploughed--'tis all in vain--the  creed of a binder is very short, and comprised in a single article, and  that article is the one vile word \"Shavings.\" But not now will I follow  this depressing subject; binders, as enemies of books, deserve, and  shall have, a whole chapter to themselves.    It is much easier to decry gas than to find a remedy. Sun lights require  especial arrangements, and are very expensive on account of the quantity  of gas consumed. The library illumination of the future promises to be  the electric light. If only steady and moderate in price, it would be a  great boon to public libraries, and perhaps the day is not far distant  when it will replace gas, even in private houses. That will, indeed, be  a day of jubilee to the literary labourer. The injury done by gas is so  generally acknowledged by the heads of our national libraries, that  it is strictly excluded from their domains, although the danger from  explosion and fire, even if the results of combustion were innocuous,  would be sufficient cause for its banishment.    The electric light has been in use for some months in the Reading Room  of the British Museum, and is a great boon to the readers. The light is  not quite equally diffused, and you must choose particular positions  if you want to work happily. There is a great objection, too, in the  humming fizz which accompanies the action of the electricity. There is a  still greater objection when small pieces of hot chalk fall on your  bald head, an annoyance which has been lately (1880) entirely removed  by placing a receptacle beneath each burner. You require also to become  accustomed to the whiteness of the light before you can altogether  forget it. But with all its faults it confers a great boon upon  students, enabling them not only to work three hours longer in the  winter-time, but restoring to them the use of foggy and dark days, in  which formerly no book-work at all could be pursued.[1]      [1] 1887. The system in use is still \"Siemens,\" but, owing to long  experience and improvements, is not now open to the above objections.    Heat alone, without any noxious fumes, is, if continuous, very injurious  to books, and, without gas, bindings may be utterly destroyed by  desiccation, the leather losing all its natural oils by long exposure  to much heat. It is, therefore, a great pity to place books high up in  a room where heat of any kind is as it must rise to the top, and if  sufficient to be of comfort to the readers below, is certain to be hot  enough above to injure the bindings.    The surest way to preserve your books in health is to treat them as  you would your own children, who are sure to sicken if confined in an  atmosphere which is impure, too hot, too cold, too damp, or too dry. It  is just the same with the progeny of literature.    If any credence may be given to Monkish legends, books have sometimes  been preserved in this world, only to meet a desiccating fate in the  world to come. The story is probably an invention of the enemy to throw  discredit on the learning and ability of the preaching Friars, an Order  which was at constant war with the illiterate secular Clergy. It runs  thus:--\"In the year 1439, two Minorite friars who had all their lives  collected books, died. In accordance with popular belief, they were at  once conducted before the heavenly tribunal to hear their doom, taking  with them two asses laden with books. At Heaven's gate the porter  demanded, 'Whence came ye?' The Minorites replied 'From a monastery of  St. Francis.' 'Oh!' said the porter, 'then St. Francis shall be your  judge.' So that saint was summoned, and at sight of the friars and their  burden demanded who they were, and why they had brought so many books  with them. 'We are Minorites,' they humbly replied, 'and we have brought  these few books with us as a solatium in the new Jerusalem.' 'And you,  when on earth, practised the good they teach?' sternly demanded the  saint, who read their characters at a glance. Their faltering reply  was sufficient, and the blessed saint at once passed judgment as  follows:--'Insomuch as, seduced by a foolish vanity, and against your  vows of poverty, you have amassed this multitude of books and thereby  and therefor have neglected the duties and broken the rules of your  Order, you are now sentenced to read your books for ever and ever in  the fires of Hell.' Immediately, a roaring noise filled the air, and a  flaming chasm opened in which friars, and asses and books were suddenly  engulphed.\"        CHAPTER IV. DUST AND NEGLECT.    DUST upon Books to any extent points to neglect, and neglect means more  or less slow Decay.    A well-gilt top to a book is a great preventive against damage by dust,  while to leave books with rough tops and unprotected is sure to produce  stains and dirty margins.    In olden times, when few persons had private collections of books, the  collegiate and corporate libraries were of great use to students.  The librarians' duties were then no sinecure, and there was little  opportunity for dust to find a resting-place. The Nineteenth Century  and the Steam Press ushered in a new era. By degrees the libraries which  were unendowed fell behind the age, and were consequently neglected.  No new works found their way in, and the obsolete old books were left  uncared for and unvisited. I have seen many old libraries, the doors of  which remained unopened from week's end to week's end; where you inhaled  the dust of paper-decay with every breath, and could not take up a book  without sneezing; where old boxes, full of older literature, served as  preserves for the bookworm, without even an autumn \"battue\" to thin the  breed. Occasionally these libraries were (I speak of thirty years ago)  put even to vile uses, such as would have shocked all ideas of propriety  could our ancestors have foreseen their fate.    I recall vividly a bright summer morning many years ago, when, in search  of Caxtons, I entered the inner quadrangle of a certain wealthy College  in one of our learned Universities. The buildings around were charming  in their grey tones and shady nooks. They had a noble history, too, and  their scholarly sons were (and are) not unworthy successors of their  ancestral renown. The sun shone warmly, and most of the casements were  open. From one came curling a whiff of tobacco; from another the hum  of conversation; from a third the tones of a piano. A couple of  undergraduates sauntered on the shady side, arm in arm, with broken caps  and torn gowns--proud insignia of their last term. The grey stone walls  were covered with ivy, except where an old dial with its antiquated  Latin inscription kept count of the sun's ascent. The chapel on one  side, only distinguishable from the \"rooms\" by the shape of its windows,  seemed to keep watch over the morality of the foundation, just as the  dining-hall opposite, from whence issued a white-aproned cook, did  of its worldly prosperity. As you trod the level pavement, you passed  comfortable--nay, dainty--apartments, where lace curtains at the  windows, antimacassars on the chairs, the silver biscuit-box and the  thin-stemmed wine-glass moderated academic toils. Gilt-backed books on  gilded shelf or table caught the eye, and as you turned your glance from  the luxurious interiors to the well-shorn lawn in the Quad., with its  classic fountain also gilded by sunbeams, the mental vision saw plainly  written over the whole \"The Union of Luxury and Learning.\"    Surely here, thought I, if anywhere, the old world literature will be  valued and nursed with gracious care; so with a pleasing sense of the  general congruity of all around me, I enquired for the rooms of the  librarian. Nobody seemed to be quite sure of his name, or upon whom the  bibliographical mantle had descended. His post, it seemed, was honorary  and a sinecure, being imposed, as a rule, upon the youngest \"Fellow.\"  No one cared for the appointment, and as a matter of course the keys  of office had but distant acquaintance with the lock. At last I was  rewarded with success, and politely, but mutely, conducted by the  librarian into his kingdom of dust and silence. The dark portraits of  past benefactors looked after us from their dusty old frames in dim  astonishment as we passed, evidently wondering whether we meant \"work\";  book-decay--that peculiar flavour which haunts certain libraries--was  heavy in the air, the floor was dusty, making the sunbeams as we passed  bright with atoms; the shelves were dusty, the \"stands\" in the middle  were thick with dust, the old leather table in the bow window, and  the chairs on either side, were very dusty. Replying to a question,  my conductor thought there was a manuscript catalogue of the Library  somewhere, but thought, also, that it was not easy to find any books  by it, and he knew not at the minute where to put his hand upon it. The  Library, he said, was of little use now, as the Fellows had their own  books and very seldom required 17th and 18th century editions, and no  new books had been added to the collection for a long time.    We passed down a few steps into an inner library where piles of early  folios were wasting away on the ground. Beneath an old ebony table were  two long carved oak chests. I lifted the lid of one, and at the top  was a once-white surplice covered with dust, and beneath was a mass of  tracts--Commonwealth quartos, unbound--a prey to worms and decay. All  was"]]]
