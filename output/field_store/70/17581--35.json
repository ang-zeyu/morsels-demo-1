Sir Edward Grey formulated and circulated his conference proposal on the  next day, July 26th. Some persons to whom I spoke at the time welcomed  the idea; they belonged principally to the lower middle classes. One  well-known Pan-Germanist (Dr. Beckmann, professor of history in Erlangen  University) said that the proposal was an admission of a diplomatic  defeat and a sign that the Entente Powers were afraid to draw the sword.  If the three Powers in question were prepared to pocket this smack in  the face, then Germany would be satisfied, because such a defeat would  mean that the Triple Entente would never be able to work together again.    It is interesting to compare with this opinion those of two leading  newspapers:    (1.) \"We understand that the German Government is not absolutely hostile  to England's endeavours to bring about a mediation between the  contending Powers by those not directly interested in the conflict. But  the German Government makes its participation in the mediation dependent  upon whether Austria-Hungary would accept this procedure, and in which  respect Austria wishes the mediation to follow. The German Government  cannot support any action which Austria-Hungary does not desire, as that  would mean exercising pressure.    \"From Sir Edward Grey's declaration in the House of Commons it is clear  that he was not thinking of mediation between Austria and Serbia, but  between Austria and Russia. This shade of meaning requires attention. We  think that any attempt at mediation between Austria and Serbia would  have no prospect of success, because in Vienna they do not seem inclined  to accept such an action. Diplomatic relations have not been broken off;  the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs confers still with the Austrian  Ambassador, and it is not easy to see why the other Powers Should not  further this discussion in a mediative sense.    \"But then Sir Edward Grey gave his idea more exact form and proposed a  conference between the German, Italian and French ambassadors and  himself. This conference of ambassadors is to seek a basis for an  agreement and then submit the result to the cabinets in Vienna and St.  Petersburg. In his yesterday's speech he emphasized the point that no  hostilities may take place till the conference has concluded its work.    \"Here, of course, is the difficulty which mars his plan, for it is  questionable whether Austria will consent to a postponement of her  military operations. Negotiations concerning Sir Edward Grey's proposal  are at present occupying the cabinets, and it is to be hoped that a  means will be found to make it acceptable to the Powers most interested  in the conflict.\"[4]    [Footnote 4: _Berliner Tagtblatt_, July 28th.]    (2.) \"Germany not only cherishes, in a platonic manner, the desire of  the Western Powers to prevent the conflict between Austria and Serbia  spreading to the great Powers, but the Berlin cabinet has already been  active in more than one European capital in favour of a mediation which  will secure European peace. In this respect we are pleased (_Man  begruesst es hier_) that, in consequence of Sir Edward Grey's initiative,  the mediation idea has assumed an official form and is open for public  discussion. There is, however, reason to doubt whether a conference  between four great Powers as an organ for the mediation is the most  suitable way out of the difficulty. Everyone is quite agreed that the  details of the Austro-Serbian conflict, which concerns these two States  alone, cannot be brought before the forum of a conference; but as  regards the removal in good time of any difficulties which may arise  between Austria and Russia, the question must be raised as to whether  the Governments of these States are willing to entrust an official  mediation to a conference of four other great Powers. For the success of  the mediation proposal it would be more practical if the means to this  end were made as simple as possible, and that use was made of the  current diplomatic discussions, in immediate communication with the  capitals of the Empires in question, in order to carry through a  mediatory action to the result desired on all sides.    \"In the employment of these means Germany would not fail to support the  Western Powers as she has already done up to the present.\"[5]    [Footnote 5: _Koelnische Zeitung_, July 28th.]    I have carefully searched the official publications of the Central  Powers (Germany's White Book; Austria's Orange Book), and can find no  record in them of any pacific action on Germany's part in either of the  European capitals; hence the claims made in the above article seem to be  an exaggeration.    It appears incredible that these Powers should have omitted to give  proof of such action when making their case public for the sole purpose  of proving their innocence before the world. On the other hand, the  impression given by these books is that Germany and Austria's attitude  was:    To SERBIA: The conditions must be accepted _ad hoc_ to the smallest  tittle and comma. Alternative, war.    To RUSSIA: What we have determined upon is unalterable and inevitable,  and you must submit to this decision. Alternative, war.    The _Goerlitzer Nachrichten_ published the following paragraph on July  30th: \"Vienna, July 29th. After having made inquiries in official  circles, the morning papers make this announcement: Count Berchtold has  informed the English Ambassador that the Austro-Hungarian Government is  grateful for Grey's mediation proposal, and appreciates the good  intentions of the British Government. A peaceful solution of the  conflict with Serbia is, however, no longer possible, as the declaration  of war had already been signed.\"    Before leaving this all-important episode, it is instructive to compare  three other versions of the reason for refusing a conference. Sir Edward  Grey mooted the proposal for a conference to the ambassadors in London  on Friday, July 24th. On the afternoon he requested the British  Ambassador in Berlin to propose the conference to the German Government.    In spite of this, document No. 12 in the German White Book, a telegram  from the German Chancellor to Prince Lichnowsky in London runs: \"We know  nothing here of a proposal from Sir Edward Grey to hold a conference of  four in London, etc.\" Another telegram, document No. 15, bearing the  same date and likewise from Bethmann-Hollweg to Lichnowsky is as  follows: \"We have immediately commenced the mediatory action in Vienna  in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey. Furthermore, we have informed  Count Berchtold of M. Sasonow's desire to communicate with him  direct.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: This message leads to the assumption that direct  communications between Vienna and Petrograd had already ceased, although  the _Koelnische Zeitung_ told the German public on the following day that  they had not.]    The next document in the German White Book is dated July 28th. It is a  telegram from the German Ambassador in Vienna to the German Chancellor  in Berlin. \"Count Berchtold begs me to express his thanks to you for  communicating the English mediation proposal. He replies, however, that  in consequence of the commencement of hostilities by Serbia and after  the declaration of war which has meanwhile been made he must look upon  England's step as being too late.\"    In the Austrian Orange Book, p. 122, we find this passage in a telegram  from Count Berchtold to the Austrian representative in London: \"When Sir  Edward Grey speaks of the possibility of avoiding an outbreak of  hostilities he is too late, for yesterday Serbians shot at our frontier  guards, and to-day we have declared war on Serbia.\"    There are two points in these telegrams which require explanation.  Firstly, why should Sir Edward Grey's proposal take so long to reach  Vienna. Apparently it took from Monday to Wednesday to go by telegram  from London via Berlin to Vienna. Two German newspapers (already quoted)  knew of this conference idea on the 27th of July and commented upon it  in their morning editions of the following day.    The other point is the Austrian statement that Serbia commenced  hostilities. If this were the case, one would expect that  Austria-Hungary, in declaring war subsequently to the alleged shooting  by Serbians at frontier guards, would make mention of the acts as a  _casus belli_. On p. 117 of the Red Book the text of the declaration of  war is given in full, but there is no mention of any resort to arms on  the part of Serbia.    We are forced to the conclusion that Germany and Austria are mutually  responsible for preventing the conference; they desired war, and a  conference might have preserved peace. During the present summer (1915)  an important work has been published in Germany from which the following  passage is taken:    \"Grey thought the time had now arrived to formulate a mediation  proposal. This idea was from the very beginning unacceptable to Austria,  because that would indirectly be a recognition of Russia as an  interested Power in the Austro-Serbian conflict. Only those who have  followed the development of mutual obligations between the Entente  Powers are able to understand the role which Russia's two comrades  (France and England)--to say nothing at all of Italy--would have played  in this conference. During its sittings Russia would have continued her  military preparations, while Germany would have been pledged not to  mobilize. Finally, nobody could assert that the man (Sir Edward Grey)  who would have presided over these negotiations, could have been  impartial. The more one thinks about this mediation proposal the more  clearly one recognizes that it would have made for a diplomatic victory  of the Triple Entente.\"[7]    [Footnote 7: Professor Hermann Oncken: \"Deutschland und der Weltkrieg,\"  pp. 545-6.]    Even the claim that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#4)"],[1,"oolman, of the State Agricultural Experiment  Station, where he had studied for two years.    \"Bunt, or stinking smut, is caused by two different species of  microscopic fungi which live as parasites in the wheat plant. Both are  essentially similar in their effects and their life-history. _Tilletia  tritici_, or the rough-spored variety, is the common stinking smut of  the Pacific regions, while _Tilletia foetans_, or the smooth-spored  species, is the one generally found in the eastern United States.    \"The smut 'berries,' or 'balls,' from an infected head contain millions  of minute bodies, the spores or 'seeds' of the smut fungus. These  reproduce the smut in somewhat the same way that a true seed develops  into a new plant. A single smut ball of average size contains a  sufficient number of spores to give one for each grain of wheat in five  or six bushels. It takes eight smut spores to equal the diameter of a  human hair. Normal wheat grains from an infected field may have so many  spores lodged on their surface as to give them a dark color, but other  grains which show no difference in color to the naked eye may still  contain a sufficient number of spores to produce a smutty crop if seed  treatment is not practised.    \"When living smut spores are introduced into the soil with the seed  wheat, or exist in the soil in which smut-free wheat is sown, a certain  percentage of the wheat plants are likely to become infected. The smut  spore germinates and produces first a stage of the smut plant in the  soil. This first stage never infects a young seedling direct, but gives  rise to secondary spores, or sporida, from which infection threads may  arise and penetrate the shoot of a young seedling and reach the growing  point. Here the fungus threads keep pace with the growth of the plant  and reach maturity at or slightly before harvest-time.    \"Since this disease is caused by an internal parasite, it is natural to  expect certain responses to its presence. It should be noted first that  the smut fungus is living at the expense of its host plant, the wheat,  and its effect on the host may be summarized as follows: The consumption  of food, the destruction of food in the sporulating process, and the  stimulating or retarding effect on normal physiological processes.    \"Badly smutted plants remain in many cases under-size and produce fewer  and smaller heads. In the Fife and Bluestem varieties the infected heads  previous to maturity exhibit a darker green color, and remain green  longer than the normal heads. In some varieties the infected heads stand  erect, when normal ones begin to droop as a result of the increasing  weight of the ripening grain.    \"A crop may become infected with smut in a number of different ways.  Smut was originally introduced with the seed, and many farmers are still  planting it every season with their seed wheat. Wheat taken from a  smutty crop will have countless numbers of loose spores adhering to the  grains, also a certain number of unbroken smut balls. These are always a  source of danger, even when the seed is treated with fungicides before  sowing.    \"There are also chances for the infection of a crop if absolutely  smut-free seed is employed. First, soil infection from a previous smutty  crop; second, soil infection from wind-blown spores. Experiments have  shown that separated spores from crushed smut balls lose their effective  power in from two to three months, provided the soil is moist and loose,  and in no case do they survive a winter.    \"It does not seem probable that wheat smut will be controlled by any  single practice, but rather by the combined use of various methods: crop  rotation; the use of clean seed; seed treatment with fungicides;  cultural practices and breeding; and selection of varieties.    \"Failure to practise crop rotation is undoubtedly one of the main  explanations for the general prevalence of smut in the wheat-fields of  eastern Washington. Even with an intervening summer fallow, the smut  from a previous crop may be a source of infection. Experience shows that  a fall stubble crop is less liable to smut infection than a crop  following summer fallow. The apparent explanation for this condition is  the fact that the summer fallow becomes infected with wind-blown spores,  while in a stubble crop the wind-blown spores, as well as those  originating from the previous crop, are buried in plowing.    \"If clean seed or properly treated seed had been used by all farmers we  should never have had a smut problem. High per cents. of smut indicate  either soil infection or imperfect treatment. The principle of the  chemical treatment is to use a poison which will kill the superficial  spores of the smut and not materially injure the germinating power of  the seed. The hot-water treatment is only recommended when one of the  chemical 'steeps' is not effective.    \"Certain cultural practices are beneficial in reducing the amount of  smut in all cases, while the value of others depends to some extent upon  the source of the smut spores. The factors which always influence the  amount of smut are the temperature of the soil during the germinating  period, the amount of soil moisture, and the depth of seeding. Where  seed-borne spores are the only sources of infection, attention to the  three factors mentioned will give the only cultural practices for  reducing the amount of smut.    \"Early seeding has been practised by various farmers, and they report a  marked reduction in smut.    \"The replowing of the summer fallow after the first fall rains is  generally effective in reducing the amount of smut.    \"Very late planting--that is, four or five weeks after the first good  fall rains--is also an effective practice. Fall tillage of summer  fallow, other than plowing, seems to be beneficial.    \"No smut-immune varieties of wheat are known, but the standard varieties  show varying degrees of resistance. Spring wheats generally suffer less  from smut than winter varieties. This is not due to any superior  resistance, but rather to the fact that they escape infection. If only  spring wheats were grown our smut problem would largely disappear; but a  return to this practice is not suggested, since the winter wheats are  much more desirable. It seems probable that the conditions which prevail  during the growing season may have considerable influence on the per  cent of smut in any given variety.\"           *       *       *       *       *    When Dorn finished his discourse, to receive the thanks of his  listeners, they walked back through the yard toward the road. Mr.  Anderson, who led the way, halted rather abruptly.    \"Hum! Who're those men talkin' to my driver?\" he queried.    Dorn then saw a couple of strangers standing near the motor-car, engaged  in apparently close conversation with the chauffeur. Upon the moment  they glanced up to see Mr. Anderson approaching, and they rather  hurriedly departed. Dorn had noted a good many strangers lately--men  whose garb was not that of farmers, whose faces seemed foreign, whose  actions were suspicious.    \"I'll bet a hundred they're I.W.W.'s,\" declared Anderson. \"Take my  hunch, Dorn.\"    The strangers passed on down the road without looking back.    \"Wonder where they'll sleep to-night?\" muttered Dorn.    Anderson rather sharply asked his driver what the two men wanted. And  the reply he got was that they were inquiring about work.    \"Did they speak English?\" went on the rancher.    \"Well enough to make themselves understood,\" replied the driver.    Dorn did not get a good impression from the shifty eyes and air of  taciturnity of Mr. Anderson's man, and it was evident that the blunt  rancher restrained himself. He helped his daughter into the car, and  then put on his long coat. Next he shook hands with Dorn.    \"Young man, I've enjoyed meetin' you, an' have sure profited from same,\"  he said. \"Which makes up for your dad! I'll run over here again to see  you--around harvest-time. An' I'll be wishin' for that rain.\"    \"Thank you. If it does rain I'll be happy to see you,\" replied Dorn,  with a smile.    \"Well, if it doesn't rain I won't come. I'll put it off another year,  an' cuss them other fellers into holdin' off, too.\"    \"You're very kind. I don't know how I'd--we'd ever repay you in that  case.\"    \"Don't mention it. Say, how far did you say it was to Palmer? We'll have  lunch there.\"    \"It's fifteen miles--that way,\" answered Dorn. \"If it wasn't for--for  father I'd like you to stay--and break some of my bread.\"    Dorn was looking at the girl as he spoke. Her steady gaze had been on  him ever since she entered the car, and in the shade of her hat and the  veil she was adjusting her eyes seemed very dark and sweet and  thoughtful. She brightly nodded her thanks as she held the veil aside  with both hands.    \"I wish you luck. Good-by,\" she said, and closed the veil.    Still, Dorn could see her eyes through it, and now they were sweeter,  more mysterious, more provocative of haunting thoughts. It flashed over  him with dread certainty that he had fallen in love with her. The shock  struck him mute. He had no reply for the rancher's hearty farewell. Then  the car lurched away and dust rose in a cloud.          CHAPTER III    With a strange knocking of his heart, high up toward his throat, Kurt  Dorn stood stock-still, watching the moving cloud of dust until it  disappeared over the hill.    No doubt entered his mind. The truth, the fact, was a year old--a  long-familiar and dreamy state--but its meaning had not been revealed to  him until just a moment past. Everything had changed when she looked out  with that sweet, steady gaze through the parted veil and then slowly  closed it. She had changed. There was something intangible about her  that last moment, baffling, haunting. He leaned against a crooked old  gate-post that as a boy he had climbed, and the thought came to him that  this spot would all "]]]
