Yours, JOHN E. WARREN.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SUMMER NIGHT.    We are in the midst of July--in the midst of summer--of the most  genial and pure-aired summer that we have had for years. How  beautifully RICHTER, translated by our Longfellow, of kindred genius,  describes the holy time! \"The summer alone might elevate us. God what  a season! In sooth, I often know not whether to stay in the city, or  go forth into the fields, so alike is it everywhere and beautiful. If  we go outside the city gate, the very beggars gladden our hearts,  for they are no longer cold; and the post-boys who can pass the whole  night on horseback, and the shepherds asleep in the open air. We need  no gloomy house. We make a chamber out of every bush, and therefore  have my good industrious bees before us, and the most gorgeous  butterflies. In the gardens on the hills sit schoolboys, and in the  open air look out words in the dictionary. On account of the game-laws  there is no shooting now, and every thing in bush and furrow, and on  green branches, can enjoy itself right heartily and safely. In all  directions come travelers along the roads; they have their carriages  for the most part thrown back--the horses have branches stuck in their  saddles, and the drivers roses in their mouths. The shadows of the  clouds go trailing along,--the birds fly between them up and down, and  journeymen mechanics wander cheerily on with their bundles, and want  no work. Even when it rains we love to stand out of doors, and breathe  in the quickening influence, and the wet does the herdsman harm no  more. And is it night, so sit we only in a cooler shadow, from which  we plainly discern the daylight on the northern horizon and on the  sweet warm stars of heaven. Wheresoever I look, there do I find my  beloved blue on the flax in blossoms, on the corn-flowers, and the  godlike endless heaven into which I would fain spring as into a  stream. And now, if we turn homeward again, we find indeed but fresh  delight. The street is a true nursery, for in the evening after  supper, the little ones, though they have but a few clothes upon  them, are again let out into the open air, and not driven under the  bed-quilt as in winter. We sup by daylight, and hardly know where  the candlesticks are. In the bed-chamber the windows are open day  and night, and likewise most of the doors, without danger. The oldest  women stand by the window without a chill, and sew. Flowers lie about  everywhere--by the ink-stand--on the lawyer's papers--on the justice's  table, and the tradesman's counter. The children make a great noise,  and one hears bowling of ninepin alleys half the night through our  walks up and down the street; and talks aloud, and sees the stars  shoot in the high heaven. The foreign musicians, who wend their  way homeward toward midnight, go fiddling along the street to their  quarters, and the whole neighborhood runs to the window. The extra  posts arrive later, and the horses neigh. One lies by the noise in  the window and droops asleep. The post-horns awake him and the whole  starry heaven hath spread itself open. O God! what a joyous life on  this little earth.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Emma is from the German, and signifies a nurse; Caroline, from the  Latin--noble minded; George, from the Greek-a farmer; Martha, from  Hebrew--bitterness; the beautiful and common Mary is Hebrew, and means  a drop of salt water--a tear; Sophia, from Greek--wisdom; Susan,  from Hebrew--a lily; Thomas, from Hebrew--a twin; and Robert, from  German--famous in council.             *       *       *       *       *    AUTHORS AND BOOKS.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. James and Copyright.--It appears that the visit of Mr. G.P.R.  James, with which we are presently to be honored, is not, after all,  solely for the \"gratification of the natural curiosity\" of the author  of the book with so many titles, as some time ago he advised one of  his correspondents here. The London _News_ observes incidentally:  \"The long-vexed question of an international copyright with our  transatlantic cousins shows symptoms of rising to a speedy crisis. Up  to a recent period the Yankees had all the advantage of the defective  state of the law. They could steal freely from our literary richness;  whereas, not only had they little of their own to be robbed of,  but their handful of authors took very good care to secure English  publishers, and, therefore, English copyrights, for their works. This  defense, however, a recent law decision has wrested from the Coopers  and Irvings of the States; so that English booksellers have now a  perfect right to treat American authors as American booksellers  have long been in the habit of serving English authors. And there is  something just in this _lex talionis_. If Dickens, may be reprinted  and sold for a shilling in New York, why may not Cooper be reprinted  and sold for a shilling in London? At all events, the reprisal system  will possibly incline our Yankee neighbors to listen to reason, and to  favor _the embassy which Mr. James, the novelist, is to undertake to  the States, with a view of making preliminary arrangements for a  full and satisfactory code directed against all future international  literary free-booting_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Albert Smith and \"Protection.\"--The _Spectator_, misled by a statement  in the Morning Post, to the effect that a Mr. Albert Smith was  present, by invitation, at a Protectionist meeting at Wallingford,  made some caustic remarks on the supposed adhesion of the witty  novelist to the cause of dear bread. The latter, astounded thereby,  sends the _Spectator_ a note, in which he says:    \"The Sphinx, at which you pleasantly affirm I came home laughing from  Egypt, never propounded a darker puzzle to any of its victims than you  have to me. From last week's _Spectator_ I learn, for the first time,  that I was at a Protection meeting at Wallingford on some particular  day, and that I wept at the prices of 1845. Allow me to assure you  that I never was at Wallingford in my life: nor, indeed, did I ever  attend a public meeting anywhere. I have not the slightest notion  what the prices--I presume of corn--were in 1845; and I should never  think of expressing an opinion, in any way, upon politics, except  against that school which abuses respectability and philanthropizes  mischievous rift-raff.\"           *       *       *       *       *    R.H. Stoddard is preparing for the press of Ticknor, Reed & Fields, a  collection of his Poems, to include most of those he has contributed  to the periodicals since the appearance of his \"Footprints,\" two years  ago. The book will be welcomed by the lovers of genuine poetry. Mr.  Stoddard is a young man of unquestionable genius, and we have been  pleased to observe that there is a decided improvement from time to  time in his compositions, indicating the industry and wise direction  of his studies, in refinement of taste, elegance of finish, and a  rapid and vigorous expansion of his imagination. His masterpiece, thus  far, is The _Castle in the Air_, fitly praised by our neighbor of the  _Albion_, as one of the finest productions of the present time. We do  not know of any poet at home or abroad to whose fame it would not have  added new luster. In the July number of the _Knickerbocker_ we find  the following \"Dirge,\" which is not unworthy of him:      There's a new grave in the old church-yard,      Another mound in the snow;    And a maid whose soul was whiter far,      Sleeps in her shroud below.      The winds of March are piping loud,      And the snow comes down for hours;    But by-and-by the April rains      Will bring the sweet May flowers.      The sweet May flowers will cover her grave      Made green by the April rain;    But blight will lie on our memories.      And our tears will fall in vain!           *       *       *       *       *    Inedited Correspondence of Goethe and Schiller.--By many friends of  German literature it will be remembered that Goethe, during his life,  carefully preserved a particular portion of his papers and letters,  which he in 1827 transferred to the government of Weimar, on the  condition that the box in which they were contained should not be  opened until the present year. The 17th of May was the date fixed  upon, and in accordance with the will of the deceased poet, his heirs  and those of his brother poet Schiller were on that day judicially  summoned to Weimar to witness the opening of the case. Of Schiller's  descendants there were present on the occasion, his eldest son and  eldest daughter, and the widow of Ernst von Schiller. Goethe was  represented by his daughter-in-law and his two grandsons, Wolfgang and  Walther, who came from Vienna, their present place of residence, for  the purpose. Schiller's eldest son is chief inspector of forests in  Wurtemberg. Madame de Junot and Frau von Goethe were also present. The  box on being opened was found to contain a full correspondence between  Schiller and Goethe, ready arranged for the press. A codicil in  Goethe's will provides for their publication. Most of the letters, all  of Schiller's in fact, are autograph.           *       *       *       *       *    The Countess Ossoli, (Margaret Fuller,) we learn from the _Tribune_,  will be in New York about the 20th of the present month. Her work on  Italy will be given to the press immediately after her arrival.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Hoefer against Dr. Layard.--Dr. Hoefer, a well-known _savant_ in  France and Germany, has astonished the Parisians by the publication  of a work in which he boldly denies the authenticity of the ruins of  Nineveh. Even admitting, he says, that the ruins of Nineveh remain,  it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#4)"],[1,"en,  male and female; onced I seen 'em I couldn't lose one off my memory, not  if you were to pay me bounty, five dollars a face. White men, that is.  Can't do nothing with niggers or Chinese. But you're white, all  right.\" The drummer suddenly returned to the Virginian with this high  compliment. The cow-puncher had taken out a pipe, and was slowly rubbing  it. The compliment seemed to escape his attention, and the drummer went  on.    \"I can tell a man when he's white, put him at Ikey's or out loose here  in the sage-brush.\" And he rolled a cigar across to the Virginian's  plate.    \"Selling them?\" inquired the Virginian.    \"Solid goods, my friend. Havana wrappers, the biggest tobacco  proposition for five cents got out yet. Take it, try it, light it, watch  it burn. Here.\" And he held out a bunch of matches.    The Virginian tossed a five-cent piece over to him.    \"Oh, no, my friend! Not from you! Not after Ikey's. I don't forget you.  See? I knowed your face right away. See? That's straight. I seen you at  Chicago all right.\"    \"Maybe you did,\" said the Virginian. \"Sometimes I'm mighty careless what  I look at.\"    \"Well, py damn!\" now exclaimed the Dutch drummer, hilariously. \"I am  ploom disappointed. I vas hoping to sell him somedings myself.\"    \"Not the same here,\" stated the American. \"He's too healthy for me. I  gave him up on sight.\"    Now it was the American drummer whose bed the Virginian had in his eye.  This was a sensible man, and had talked less than his brothers in the  trade. I had little doubt who would end by sleeping in his bed; but how  the thing would be done interested me more deeply than ever.    The Virginian looked amiably at his intended victim, and made one or two  remarks regarding patent medicines. There must be a good deal of money  in them, he supposed, with a live man to manage them. The victim was  flattered. No other person at the table had been favored with so much  of the tall cow-puncher's notice. He responded, and they had a pleasant  talk. I did not divine that the Virginian's genius was even then at  work, and that all this was part of his satanic strategy. But Steve must  have divined it. For while a few of us still sat finishing our supper,  that facetious horseman returned from doctoring his horse's hoofs, put  his head into the dining room, took in the way in which the Virginian  was engaging his victim in conversation, remarked aloud, \"I've lost!\"  and closed the door again.    \"What's he lost?\" inquired the American drummer.    \"Oh, you mustn't mind him,\" drawled the Virginian. \"He's one of those  box-head jokers goes around openin' and shuttin' doors that-a-way. We  call him harmless. Well,\" he broke off, \"I reckon I'll go smoke. Not  allowed in hyeh?\" This last he addressed to the landlady, with especial  gentleness. She shook her head, and her eyes followed him as he went  out.    Left to myself I meditated for some time upon my lodging for the night,  and smoked a cigar for consolation as I walked about. It was not a hotel  that we had supped in. Hotel at Medicine Bow there appeared to be none.  But connected with the eating-house was that place where, according  to Steve, the beds were all taken, and there I went to see for myself.  Steve had spoken the truth. It was a single apartment containing four or  five beds, and nothing else whatever. And when I looked at these beds,  my sorrow that I could sleep in none of them grew less. To be alone in  one offered no temptation, and as for this courtesy of the country, this  doubling up--!    \"Well, they have got ahead of us.\" This was the Virginian standing at my  elbow.    I assented.    \"They have staked out their claims,\" he added.    In this public sleeping room they had done what one does to secure a  seat in a railroad train. Upon each bed, as notice of occupancy, lay  some article of travel or of dress. As we stood there, the two Jews came  in and opened and arranged their valises, and folded and refolded their  linen dusters. Then a railroad employee entered and began to go to bed  at this hour, before dusk had wholly darkened into night. For him, going  to bed meant removing his boots and placing his overalls and waistcoat  beneath his pillow. He had no coat. His work began at three in the  morning; and even as we still talked he began to snore.    \"The man that keeps the store is a friend of mine,\" said the Virginian;  \"and you can be pretty near comfortable on his counter. Got any  blankets?\"    I had no blankets.    \"Looking for a bed?\" inquired the American drummer, now arriving.    \"Yes, he's looking for a bed,\" answered the voice of Steve behind him.    \"Seems a waste of time,\" observed the Virginian. He looked thoughtfully  from one bed to another. \"I didn't know I'd have to lay over here. Well,  I have sat up before.\"    \"This one's mine,\" said the drummer, sitting down on it. \"Half's plenty  enough room for me.\"    \"You're cert'nly mighty kind,\" said the cow-puncher. \"But I'd not think  o' disconveniencing yu'.\"    \"That's nothing. The other half is yours. Turn in right now if you feel  like it.\"    \"No. I don't reckon I'll turn in right now. Better keep your bed to  yourself.\"    \"See here,\" urged the drummer, \"if I take you I'm safe from drawing some  party I might not care so much about. This here sleeping proposition is  a lottery.\"    \"Well,\" said the Virginian (and his hesitation was truly masterly), \"if  you put it that way--\"    \"I do put it that way. Why, you're clean! You've had a shave right now.  You turn in when you feel inclined, old man! I ain't retiring just yet.\"    The drummer had struck a slightly false note in these last remarks. He  should not have said \"old man.\" Until this I had thought him merely an  amiable person who wished to do a favor. But \"old man\" came in wrong.  It had a hateful taint of his profession; the being too soon with  everybody, the celluloid good-fellowship that passes for ivory with nine  in ten of the city crowd. But not so with the sons of the sagebrush.  They live nearer nature, and they know better.    But the Virginian blandly accepted \"old man\" from his victim: he had a  game to play. \"Well, I cert'nly thank yu',\" he said. \"After a while I'll  take advantage of your kind offer.\"    I was surprised. Possession being nine points of the law, it seemed  his very chance to intrench himself in the bed. But the cow-puncher  had planned a campaign needing no intrenchments. Moreover, going to bed  before nine o'clock upon the first evening in many weeks that a town's  resources were open to you, would be a dull proceeding. Our entire  company, drummer and all, now walked over to the store, and here my  sleeping arrangements were made easily. This store was the cleanest  place and the best in Medicine Bow, and would have been a good store  anywhere, offering a multitude of things for sale, and kept by a very  civil proprietor. He bade me make myself at home, and placed both of his  counters at my disposal. Upon the grocery side there stood a cheese too  large and strong to sleep near comfortably, and I therefore chose the  dry-goods side. Here thick quilts were unrolled for me, to make it soft;  and no condition was placed upon me, further than that I should remove  my boots, because the quilts were new, and clean, and for sale. So  now my rest was assured. Not an anxiety remained in my thoughts. These  therefore turned themselves wholly to the other man's bed, and how he  was going to lose it.    I think that Steve was more curious even than myself. Time was on the  wing. His bet must be decided, and the drinks enjoyed. He stood against  the grocery counter, contemplating the Virginian. But it was to me that  he spoke. The Virginian, however, listened to every word.    \"Your first visit to this country?\"    I told him yes.    \"How do you like it?\"    I expected to like it very much.    \"How does the climate strike you?\"    I thought the climate was fine.    \"Makes a man thirsty though.\"    This was the sub-current which the Virginian plainly looked for. But he,  like Steve, addressed himself to me.    \"Yes,\" he put in, \"thirsty while a man's soft yet. You'll harden.\"    \"I guess you'll find it a drier country than you were given to expect,\"  said Steve.    \"If your habits have been frequent that way,\" said the Virginian.    \"There's parts of Wyoming,\" pursued Steve, \"where you'll go hours and  hours before you'll see a drop of wetness.\"    \"And if yu' keep a-thinkin' about it,\" said the Virginian, \"it'll seem  like days and days.\"    Steve, at this stroke, gave up, and clapped him on the shoulder with a  joyous chuckle. \"You old son-of-a!\" he cried affectionately.    \"Drinks are due now,\" said the Virginian. \"My treat, Steve. But I reckon  your suspense will have to linger a while yet.\"    Thus they dropped into direct talk from that speech of the fourth  dimension where they had been using me for their telephone.    \"Any cyards going to-night?\" inquired the Virginian.    \"Stud and draw,\" Steve told him. \"Strangers playing.\"    \"I think I'd like to get into a game for a while,\" said the Southerner.  \"Strangers, yu' say?\"    And then, before quitting the store, he made his toilet for this little  hand at poker. It was a simple preparation. He took his pistol from its  holster, examined it, then shoved it between his overalls and his shirt  in front, and pulled his waistcoat over it. He might have been combing  his hair for all the attention any one paid to this, except myself. Then  the two friends went out, and I bethought me of that epithet which  Steve again had used to the Virginian as he clapped him on the shoulder.  Clearly this wild country spoke a language other than mine--the word  here was a term of endearment. Such was my conclusion.    The drummers had finished their dealings with the proprietor, and they  were gossiping together in a knot by the door as the Virginian passed  out.    \"See you later, old man!\" This was the American"]]]
