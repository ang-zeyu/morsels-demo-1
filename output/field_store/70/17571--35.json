GALBREATH      In the vertebrate paleontological collection at the University of  Kansas Museum of Natural History there are many fragments of turtles  that have been collected, generally in connection with the  excavation  or recovery of other fossils. The generic identification of this  material is possible in many instances, and such identifications give  new and important geological and distributional records for genera in  existence today.    All catalogue numbers refer to the vertebrate paleontological  collection in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.      Family KINOSTERNIDAE    +Kinosternon+ sp. No. 7729 consists of fragments of marginals, costals,  and plastronal elements collected from Edson Quarry, Sherman County,  Kansas. The age is middle Pliocene (Hemphillian). No. 7679, consisting  of a nuchal, and fragments of marginals, costals, and neurals is from  Nye Sink, XI Ranch, Meade County, Kansas, and is of Pleistocene age.    Any fossil record of _Kinosternon_ is a welcome find, and these  two specimens give new data both as to age and distribution. However,  it should be emphasized that these identifications are based on  fragments, and are tentative.      Family EMYDIDAE    +Pseudemys+ sp. No. 5613, Sherman County; 6784, Seward County; and  4728, Meade County, are three of many fragments, mainly elements of  the nuchal plate and plastron, that were collected from Edson Quarry,  Sherman County, Kansas, and from middle and late Pliocene beds in  Seward and Meade counties, Kansas, respectively. The species  represented cannot be differentiated from species of _Pseudemys_  living today. Species of _Pseudemys_ are common also in most of the  Pleistocene deposits of western Kansas.      Family TESTUDINIDAE    +Testudo+ sp. In general, two recognizable lines of the genus _Testudo_  existed in western Kansas during early Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene  time--a line of large testudinates with a carapace three to four feet  long, and one line of smaller tortoises with a rugose carapace  approximately six to nine inches in diameter. Hibbard's _Testudo riggsi_  (Hibbard, 1944) is the best known of these smaller turtles.    +Gopherus+ sp. No. 5935 is from the Pleistocene of Harper County,  Kansas, and No. 7677 is from the early Pleistocene of Beaver County,  Oklahoma. Each is composed of costals and neurals which may be referred  to this genus. Their size indicates an animal considerably larger than  any on record, and probably these specimens represent a new species.      Family CHELYDRIDAE    +Chelydra+ sp. No. 6821 is the anterior part of a plastron from the  Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas. The age is middle Pliocene. This  fragment has been listed three times in print, once merely as Chelonia  (having reference to the order) (Adams and Martin, 1931), and twice by  Hibbard (1934 and 1939) as _Chelonia_ sp. Hibbard's listing was  obviously a _lapsus calami_ for _Chelydra_ since he placed the genus in  the family Chelydridae.    No. 6479 is part of a costal and marginals from Meade County, Kansas.  This specimen was associated with _Aenocyon dirus_, and is Pleistocene  in age.      Family TRIONYCHIDAE    +Amyda+ sp. No. 6800 is part of a costal collected in Seward County,  Kansas. It is possibly of early Pleistocene age. No. 7568 is part of  a carapace from Meade County, Kansas, probably of the same age.          LITERATURE CITED       ADAMS, L. A., and MARTIN, H.

[Illustration: THE HOUSE IN WHICH BACH WAS BORN.]    This house stands in the town of Eisenach in Germany. It looks very much  the same today as it did when Sebastian was a little boy. Many people go  there to visit this house because the little boy grew to be a famous  man.    In Eisenach there is a statue of Bach near the palace.                  [Illustration: STATUE OF BACH AT EISENACH.]    In the same town in which Sebastian was born there stands on the top of  a hill a very famous castle built many hundreds of years ago.    This castle is called the Wartburg.                    [Illustration: THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG.]    As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with his friends, and  they, no doubt, had a happy time playing about the castle grounds. In  one of its great halls the minstrels of Germany held their Song  Contests.    When Sebastian was old enough he used to travel afoot, just as the  minstrels did; his purpose was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as  he sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring to him so that he  might eat as he rested.                    [Illustration: BACH EATING THE HERRING.]    Little Sebastian's father was named JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH. He, too, was  a musician, as his people had been for many years.                     [Illustration: JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH.]    One of these was a miller who played and sang while the corn was  grinding. His name was Veit Bach, and his little boy was called Hans,  the Player, because he, too, loved to play the violin.                  [Illustration: VEIT BACH AND HIS SON HANS.]    When Sebastian was ten years old his father and mother died. So he went  to live with his brother, whose home was a few miles away.    Of this brother Sebastian had music lessons, and he improved so rapidly  that he used to beg to be allowed to play the pieces in a big book in  the library.    But the brother refused him this pleasure. However, little Sebastian was  eager to learn all the music he could find, so he used to sit up on  moonlight nights and copy these pages while his brother was asleep.    But what do you think happened when he had copied everything in that big  book?    His brother found out what he had done and took all his precious music  away from him.                [Illustration: BACH COPYING MUSIC BY MOONLIGHT.]    If you know any boy who is about twenty years old you may say to him,  Bach was as old as you are when Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston.    And although there was this difference of twenty years or so in their  ages, we may think of them at work in the world at the same time. You  must remember that all men like Franklin and Bach who became famous did  so by working very hard.                       [Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.]    Franklin, too, was born very poor. Once he walked the streets of  Philadelphia with a loaf of bread under each arm. But by being faithful  in all he did he became the friend of all his countrymen and of Kings  and Queens besides.    Benjamin Franklin was quite a little younger than Sebastian Bach. But  there was a famous man who was almost exactly Sebastian's age. This man  composed an Oratorio that is loved by everybody. It is sung in cities  and towns all over the world, particularly at Christmas time.    Do you happen to know the name of this Oratorio? If not, you can surely  learn it by asking someone or by looking it up in a book.    Write in the name of the composer of this Oratorio below the picture,  and write on this line the name of the Oratorio itself.                ...............................................                                 [Illustration]    The composer's name is                ...............................................    The Oratorio, the name of which you have just written, was first sung in  the Irish city of Dublin, 1742.    At that time Sebastian Bach was living in Leipsic and had been for many  years at the head of the Thomas School. He was known as its Cantor. Bach  worked very hard here to supply music for several of the Leipsic  churches, and he worked so well that his fame spread until it reached  the ears of the Emperor.    Frederick the Great was also a musician and composer. So he invited  Sebastian Bach to visit him at his castle. There were many people  present, but Sebastian Bach was the principal guest. He played on many  of the Emperor's fine pianos. When he reached home again he composed a  musical work and dedicated it to the Emperor.            [Illustration: BACH PLAYING BEFORE FREDERICK THE GREAT.]    The kind of a piano that Sebastian Bach played on was not called a piano  in his day. It was called a Clavier or Clavichord.    Some day you will study a collection of pieces by Sebastian Bach which  was written for this instrument and was called _The Well Tempered  Clavichord_.    This is the kind of piano, or clavichord, that Bach used.                        [Illustration: THE CLAVICHORD.]    And here is the beginning of the very first piece in the collection of  which we have just spoken in Bach's handwriting.                      [Illustration: BACH'S HANDWRITING.]     [Illustration: MORNING PRAYERS IN THE HOME OF JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH.]    Sebastian Bach had a very large family, twenty children altogether. Two  of them studied music faithfully with their father.    One was Friedmann, for whom the father wrote a book called _Little  Preludes_. Friedmann's brother, Philipp Emanuel Bach, was a very fine  clavichord player. He wrote a book about music and composed many pieces.         [Illustration: WILLIAM FRIEDMANN BACH. PHILIPP EMANUEL BACH.]    Sebastian Bach died in 1750. He was sixty-five years of age.    Benjamin Franklin was at that time forty-four years old and George  Washington was eighteen.    This is the way Bach wrote his name.                                 [Illustration]                            FACTS ABOUT SEBASTIAN BACH.
