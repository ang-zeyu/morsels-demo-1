A root-house fronts us, with dark boughs branching over it. Sit down in  that old carved chair. If I cannot welcome some illustrious visitors in  such consummate verse as Pope, I may, I hope, not without blameless  pride, tell you, reader, in this chair have sat some public characters,  distinguished by far more noble qualities than \"the nobly pensive St.  John!\" I might add, that this seat has received, among other visiters,  Sir Samuel Romilly, Sir George Beaumont, Sir Humphry Davy--poets as well  as philosophers, Madame de Stael, Dugald Stewart, and Christopher North,  Esq.    Two lines on a small board on this root-house point the application:--      \"Dost thou lament the dead, and mourn the loss    Of many friends, oh! think upon the cross!\"    Over an old tomb-stone, through an arch, at a distance in light beyond,  there is a vista to a stone cross, which, in the seventeenth century,  would have been idolatrous!    To detail more of the garden would appear ostentatious, and I fear I may  be thought egotistical in detailing so much. I shall, however, take the  reader, before we part, through an arch, to an old yew, which has seen  the persecution of the loyal English clergy; has witnessed their return,  and many changes of ecclesiastical and national fortune. Under the  branches of that solitary but mute historian of the pensive plain, let  us now rest; it stands at the very extreme northern edge of that garden  which we have just perambulated. It fronts the tower, the churchyard,  and looks on to an old sun-dial, once a _cross_. The _cross_ was found  broken at its foot, probably by the country iconoclasts of the day. I  have brought the interesting fragment again into light, and placed it  conspicuously opposite to an old Scotch fir in the churchyard, which I  think it not unlikely was planted by Townson on his _restoration_. The  accumulation of the soil of centuries had covered an ascent of four  steps at the bottom of this record of silent hours. These steps have  been worn in places, from the act of frequent prostration or kneeling,  by the forefathers of the hamlet, perhaps before the church existed.  From a seat near this old yew tree, you see the churchyard, and  battlements of the church, on one side; and on the other you look over a  great extent of country. On a still summer's evening, the distant sound  of the hurrying coaches, on the great London road, are heard as they  pass to and from the metropolis. On this spot this last admonitory  inscription fronts you:--      \"There lie the village dead, and there too I,    When yonder dial points the hour, shall lie.    Look round, the distant prospect is display'd,    Like life's fair landscape, mark'd with light and shade.    Stranger, in peace pursue thy onward road,    But ne'er forget thy lone and last abode!\"    _History of Bremhill, by Mr. Bowles._           *       *       *       *       *        RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.    PAPER MARKS.    [Illustration]      Paper, for the purpose of writing or printing, was first manufactured in  this country, according to Anderson, about the year 1598, in the reign  of Elizabeth. There is reason, however, to believe, that its manufacture  existed here previous to that time. John Tate is recorded to have had a  paper-mill at Hertford, in the reign of Henry VII. and the first book  printed on English paper, came out in 1495 or 6. It was entitled  \"Bartholomeus de proprietatibus rerum,\" and was printed on paper made by  John Tate, jun.    The different paper marks are objects of some curiosity. Probably they  gave the names to the different sorts, many of which names are retained,  though the original marks of distinction have been relinquished. _Post_  paper originally bore the wire mark of a postman's horn, as appears on  specimens of paper of the date 1679. The fleur de lis was the peculiar  mark of demy, most likely originating in France. The open _hand_ is a  very ancient mark, giving name to a sort, which though still in use, is  considerably altered in size and texture.    _Fool's-Cap_--the name is still continued though the original design of  a fool's cap is relinquished.    _Pot Paper._--There were various designs of pots or drinking vessels;  this paper retains its proportions and size according to early  specimens, but the mark is exchanged for that of the arms of England.    The original manufacturer in this country, John Tate, marked his paper  with a star of eight points, within a double circle. The device of John  Tate, jun. was a wheel; his paper is remarkably fine and good.    Various other paper marks were in use, adopted most likely at the will  or caprice of the manufacturer. Thus we have the unicorn and other  non-descript quadrupeds, the bunch of grapes, serpent, and ox'head  surmounted by a star, a great favourite; the cross, crown, globe,  initials of manufacturers' names; and, at the conclusion of the 17th  century and commencement of the last, arms appear in escutcheons with  supporters.           *       *       *       *       *      SINGULAR REGULATIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF HENRY VIII.      The only alteration in the following is the difference of the  orthography which I have made for the benefit of your readers. They are  extracts from a curious manuscript, containing directions for the  household of Henry VIII.    \"His highness' baker shall not put alum in the bread, or mix rye, oaten,  or bean flour with the same, and if detected, he shall be put into the  stocks.    \"His highness' attendants are not to steal any locks or keys, tables,  forms, cupboards, or other furniture of noblemen's or gentlemen's  houses, where he goes to visit.    \"Master cooks shall not employ such scullions as go about naked, or lie  all night on the ground before the kitchen fire.    \"No dogs to be kept in the court, but only a few spaniels for the  ladies.    \"Dinners to be at ten, and suppers at four.    \"The officers of his privy chamber shall be loving together, no grudging  or grumbling, or talking of the king's pastime.    \"The king's barber is enjoined to be cleanly, not to frequent the  company of misguided women, for fear of danger to the king's royal  person.    \"There shall be no romping with the maids on the staircase, by which  dishes and other things are often broken!    \"The pages shall not interrupt the kitchen maids.    \"The grooms shall not steal his highness's straw for bed, sufficient  being allowed to them.    \"Coal only to be allowed to the king's, queen's, and lady Mary's  chambers.[2]    \"The brewers not to put any brimstone in the ale.    \"Twenty-four loaves a-day for his highness' greyhounds.    \"Ordered--that all noblemen and gentlemen at the end of the session of  parliament, depart to their several counties, on pain of the royal  displeasure.\"    The following items contain nothing very remarkable, and if they did,  perhaps I have copied enough already for a specimen of this ludicrous  manuscript.

In an old tract printed in the year 1749, it is stated that one Richard  _Forthave_, who lived in Bishopsgate-street Without, sold and invented  \"_a vinegar_,\" which had a great run, and he soon became noted; and from  this it may be concluded that the length of time has caused the above  corruption. The article in the pamphlet is headed \"Forthave's Vinegar.\"    W. H. H.           *       *       *       *       *      FISH.      Philip II. of Spain, the consort of our Queen Mary, gave a whimsical  reason for not eating fish. \"They are,\" said he, \"nothing but element  congealed, or a jelly of water.\"    It is related of Queen Aterbates, that she forbade her subjects ever to  touch fish, \"lest,\" said she, with calculating forecast, \"there should  not be enough left to regale their sovereign.\"           *       *       *       *       *      A GENTLEMAN'S FASHION.      In the reign of Henry VII. Sir Philip Calthorpe, a Norfolk knight, sent  as much cloth of fine French tawney, as would make him a gown, to a  tailor in Norwich. It happened, one John Drakes, a shoemaker, coming  into the shop, liked it so well, that he went and bought of the same, as  much for himself, enjoining the tailor to make it of the same fashion.  The knight was informed of this, and therefore commanded the tailor to  cut his gown as full of holes as his shears could make. John Drakes's  was made \"of the same fashion,\" but he vowed he would never be of the  _gentleman's_ fashion again.    C. F E.           *       *       *       *       *      CONVEYANCING.

These beasts, maintained at the cost of  the priestly communities in the great temples of their respective  cities, were perpetually adored and prayed to by thousands during their  lives, and at their deaths were entombed with the utmost care in huge  sarcophagi, while all Egypt went into mourning on their decease.\"    Such was the religion of Egypt as known to the Jews,--a complicated  polytheism, embracing the worship of animals as well as the powers of  Nature; the belief in the transmigration of souls, and a sacerdotalism  which carried ritualistic ceremonies to the greatest extent known to  antiquity, combined with the exaltation of the priesthood to such a  degree as to make priests the real rulers of the land, reminding us of  the spiritual despotism of the Middle Ages. The priests of Egypt ruled  by appealing to the fears of men, thus favoring a degrading  superstition. How far they taught that the various objects of worship  were symbols merely of a supreme power, which they themselves perhaps  accepted in their esoteric schools, we do not know. But the priests  believed in a future state of rewards and punishments, and thus  recognized the soul to be of more importance than the material body, and  made its welfare paramount over all other interests. This recognition  doubtless contributed to elevate the morals of the people, and to make  them religious, despite their false and degraded views of God, and their  disgusting superstitions.    The Jews could not have lived in Egypt four hundred years without being  influenced by the popular belief. Hence in the wilderness, and in the  days of kingly rule, the tendency to animal worship in the shape of the  golden calves, their love of ritualistic observances, and their easy  submission to the rule of priests. In one very important thing, however,  the Jews escaped a degrading superstition,--that of the transmigration  of souls; and it was perhaps the abhorrence by Moses of this belief that  made him so remarkably silent as to a future state. It is seemingly  ignored in the Old Testament, and hence many have been led to suppose  that the Jews did not believe in it. Certainly the most cultivated and  aristocratic sect--the Sadducees--repudiated it altogether; while the  Pharisees held to it. They, however, were products of a later age, and  had learned many things--good and bad--from surrounding nations or in  their captivities, which Moses did not attempt to teach the simple souls  that escaped from Egypt.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the other religions with which the Jews came in contact, and which  more or less were in conflict with their own monotheistic belief, very  little is definitely known, since their sacred books, if they had any,  have not come down to us. Our knowledge is mostly confined to monuments,  on which the names of their deities are inscribed, the animals which  they worshipped, symbolic of the powers of Nature, and the kings and  priests who officiated in religious ceremonies. From these we learn or  infer that among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Phoenicians religion  was polytheistic, but without so complicated or highly organized a  system as prevailed in Egypt. Only about twenty deities are alluded to  in the monumental records of either nation, and they are supposed to  have represented the sun, the moon, the stars, and various other powers,  to which were delegated by the unseen and occult supreme deity the  oversight of this world. They presided over cities and the elements of  Nature, like the rain, the thunder, the winds, the air, the water. Some  abode in heaven, some on the earth, and some in the waters under the  earth. Of all these graven images existed, carved by men's hands,--some  in the form of animals, like the winged bulls of Nineveh. In the very  earliest times, before history was written, it is supposed that the  religion of all these nations was monotheistic, and that polytheism was  a development as men became wicked and sensual. The knowledge of the one  God was gradually lost, although an indefinite belief remained that  there was a supreme power over all the other gods, at least a deity of  higher rank than the gods of the people, who reigned over them as  Lord of lords.    This deity in Assyria was Asshur. He is recognized by most authorities  as Asshur, a son of Shem and grandson of Noah, who was probably the hero  and leader of one of the early migrations, and, as founder of the  Assyrian Empire, gave it its name,--his own being magnified and deified  by his warlike descendants. Assyria was the oldest of the great empires,  occupying Mesopotamia,--the vast plain watered by the Tigris and  Euphrates rivers,--with adjacent countries to the north, west, and east.  Its seat was in the northern portion of this region, while that of  Babylonia or Chaldaea, its rival, was in the southern part; and although  after many wars freed from the subjection of Assyria, the institutions  of Babylonia, and especially its religion, were very much the same as  those of the elder empire. In Babylonia the chief god was called El, or  Il. In Babylon, although Bab-el, their tutelary god, was at the head of  the pantheon, his form was not represented, nor had he any special  temple for his worship. The Assyrian Asshur placed kings upon their  thrones, protected their armies, and directed their expeditions. In  speaking of him it was \"Asshur, my Lord.\" He was also called \"King of  kings,\" reigning supreme over the gods; and sometimes he was called the  \"Father of the gods.\" His position in the celestial hierarchy  corresponds with the Zeus of the Greeks, and with the Jupiter of the  Romans. He was represented as a man with a horned cap, carrying a bow  and issuing from a winged circle, which circle was the emblem of  ubiquity and eternity. This emblem was also the accompaniment of  Assyrian royalty.    These Assyrian and Babylonian deities had a direct influence on the Jews  in later centuries, because traders on the Tigris pushed their  adventurous expeditions from the head of the Persian Gulf, either around  the great peninsula of Arabia, or by land across the deserts, and  settled in Canaan, calling themselves Phoenicians; and it was from the  descendants of these enterprising but morally debased people that the  children of Israel, returning from Egypt, received the most pertinacious  influences of idolatrous corruption. In Phoenicia the chief deity was  also called Bel, or Baal, meaning \"Lord,\" the epithet of the one divine  being who rules the world, or the Lord of heaven. The deity of the  Egyptian pantheon, with whom Baal most nearly corresponds, was Ammon,  addressed as the supreme God.    Ranking after El in Babylon, Asshur in Assyria, and Baal in  Phoenicia,--all shadows of the same supreme God,--we notice among these  Mesopotamians a triad of the great gods, called Anu, Bel, and Hea. Anu,  the primordial chaos; Hea, life and intelligence animating matter; and  Bel, the organizing and creative spirit,--or, as Rawlinson thinks, \"the  original gods of the earth, the heavens, and the waters, corresponding  in the main with the classical Pluto, Jupiter, and Neptune, who divided  between them the dominion over the visible creation.\" The god Bel, in  the pantheon of the Babylonians and Assyrians, is the God of gods, and  Father of gods, who made the earth and heaven. His title  expresses dominion.    In succession to the gods of this first trio,--Anu, Bel, and Hea,--was  another trio, named Siu, Shamas, and Vul, representing the moon, the  sun, and the atmosphere. \"In Assyria and Babylon the moon-god took  precedence of the sun-god, since night was more agreeable to the  inhabitants of those hot countries than the day.\" Hence, Siu was the  more popular deity; but Shamas, the sun, as having most direct  reference to physical nature, \"the lord of fire,\" \"the ruler of the  day,\" was the god of battles, going forth with the armies of the king  triumphant over enemies. The worship of this deity was universal, and  the kings regarded him as affording them especial help in war. Vul, the  third of this trinity, was the god of the atmosphere, the god of  tempests,--the god who caused the flood which the Assyrian legends  recognize. He corresponds with the Jupiter Tonans of the Romans,--\"the  prince of the power of the air,\" destroyer of crops, the scatterer of  the harvest, represented with a flaming sword; but as god of the  atmosphere, the giver of rain, of abundance, \"the lord of fecundity,\" he  was beneficent as well as destructive.    All these gods had wives resembling the goddesses in the Greek  mythology,--some beneficent, some cruel; rendering aid to men, or  pursuing them with their anger. And here one cannot resist the  impression that the earliest forms of the Greek mythology were derived  from the Babylonians and Phoenicians, and that the Greek poets, availing  themselves of the legends respecting them, created the popular religion  of Greece. It is a mooted question whether the Greek civilization is  chiefly derived from Egypt, or from Assyria and Phoenicia,--probably  more from these old monarchies combined than from the original seat of  the Aryan race east of the Caspian Sea. All these ancient monarchies  had run out and were old when the Greeks began their settlements and  conquests.    There was still another and inferior class of deities among the  Assyrians and Babylonians who were objects of worship, and were supposed  to have great influence on human affairs. These deities were the planets  under different names. The early study of astronomy among the dwellers  on the plains of Babylon and in Mesopotamia gave an astral feature to  their religion which was not prominent in Egypt. These astral deities  were Nin, or Bar (the Saturn of the Romans); and"]]]
