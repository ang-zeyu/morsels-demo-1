[Footnote: A paper recently read before the Institution of Naval  Architects, London.]    By E.A. LINNINGTON.      One of the most interesting and valuable features in the development of  naval construction in recent years is the great advance which has been made  in the speeds of our war ships. This advance has been general, and not  confined to any particular vessel or class of vessel. From the first class  armored fighting ship of about 10,000 tons displacement down to the  comparatively diminutive cruiser of 1,500 tons, the very desirable quality  of a high speed has been provided.    These are all twin screw ships, and each of the twins is driven by its own  set of engines and line of shafting, so that the propelling machinery of  each ship is duplicated throughout. The speeds attained indicate a high  efficiency with the twin screws. In all ships, but more especially in high  speed ships, success depends largely upon the provision of propellers  suited for the work they have to perform, and where a high propulsive  efficiency has been secured, there is no doubt the screws are working with  a high efficiency. The principal purpose of this paper is to record the  particulars of the propellers, and the results of the trials of several of  these high speed twin screw ships. The table gives the leading particulars  of several classes of ships, the particulars of the screws, and the results  obtained on the measured mile trials from a ship of each class, except C.  The vessels whose trials are inserted in the table have not been selected  as showing the highest speeds for the several classes. Excepting C, they  are the ships which have been run on the measured mile at or near the  designed load water line. On light draught trials, speeds have been  attained from half a knot to a knot higher than those here recorded. No  ship of the class C has yet been officially tried on the measured mile, but  as several are in a forward state, perhaps the actual data from one of them  may shortly be obtained. All these measured mile trials were made under the  usual Admiralty conditions, that is to say, the ships' bottoms and the  screws were clean, and the force of the wind and state of the sea were not  such as to make the trials useless for purposes of comparison. On such  trials the i.h.p. is obtained from diagrams taken while the ship is on the  mile, and the revolutions are recorded by ruechanical counters for the time  occupied in running the mile. Not less than four runs are made during a  trial extending over several hours. The i.h.p. in the table is not  necessarily the maximum during the trial, for the average while on the mile  is sometimes a little below the average for the whole of the trial. The  revolutions are the mean for the two sets of engines, and the i.h.p. is the  sum of the powers of the two sets. The pitch of the screw is measured. The  bolt holes in the blade flanges allow an adjustment of pitch, but in each  case the blades were set as nearly as possible at the pitch at which they  were cast. The particulars given in the table may be taken to be as  reliable and accurate as such things can be obtained, and for each ship  there are corresponding data; that is, the powers, speeds, displacements,  revolutions, pitches, and other items existed at the same time. There are a  few points of detail about these propellers which deserve a passing notice.  In Fig. 1 is shown a fore and aft section through the boss. It will be  observed that the flanges of the blades are sunk into the boss, and that  the bolts are sunk into the flanges. The recess for the bolt heads is  covered with a thin plate having the curve of the flange, so that the  flanges and the boss form a section of a sphere. This method of  construction is a little more expensive than exposed flanges and bolts,  which, however, render the boss a huge churn. With the high revolutions at  which these screws work, a spherical boss is extremely desirable, but, of  course, the details need not be exactly as shown in the illustration. The  conical tail is fitted to prevent loss with eddies behind the flat end of  the boss, and is particularly valuable with the screws of high speed ships.  The light hood shown on the stern bracket is for the purpose of preventing  eddies behind the boss of the stern bracket, and to save the resistance of  the flat face of the screw boss. The edges of the blades are cast sharp,  instead of being rounded at the back, with a small radius, as in the usual  practice--the object of the sharp edge being the diminution of the edge  resistance. The driving key extends the whole length of the boss, and the  tapered shaft fits throughout its length.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    These points of detail have been features of all Admiralty screws for some  years.    The frictional resistance of screw propellers is always a fruitful source  of inefficiency. With a given screw, the loss due to friction may be taken  to vary approximately as the square of the speed. This is not to say that  the frictional resistance is greater in proportion to the thrust at high  than at low speeds. The blades of screws for any speed should be as smooth  and clean as possible, but for high speed screws the absolute saving of  friction may be considerable with an improvement of the surface. There is  no permanent advantage in polishing the blades. No doubt there is some  advantage for a little time, and, probably, better results may thereby be  secured on trial, but the blades soon become rough, and shell fish and weed  appear to grow as rapidly on recently polished blades as on an ordinary  surface. These screws are of gun metal. They were fitted to the ships in  the condition in which they left the foundry. It appears that within  certain limits mere shape of blade does not affect the efficiency of the  screw, but, with a given number of blades and a given disk, the possible  variations in the form or distribution of a given area are such that  different results may be realized. The shapes of the blades of these  propellers are shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. It will be seen the shapes are  not exactly the same for all the screws, but the differences do not call  for much remark.    [Illustration: FIG. 2., FIG. 3. & FIG. 4.]    Fig. 2 shows the blades for the A screw. C and D have the same form. Fig. 3  shows in full lines the blades of the B screw, and, though very narrow at  the tips, they, like A, are after the Griffith pattern. The blades of E and  F are of a similar shape, as shown in Fig. 4, and approach an oval form  rather than the Griffith pattern. The particulars of these propellers would  be considered incomplete without some reference to their positions with  respect to the hulls. When deciding the positions of twin screws, there is  room for variation, vertically, longitudinally, and transversely. For these  screws, the immersions inserted in the table give the vertical positions.  The immersion in A is 9 ft., showing what may be done in a deep draught  ship with a small screw. Whatever the value of deep immersion may be in  smooth water, there can be no question that it is much enhanced in a  seaway. The longitudinal positions are such that the center of the screw is  about one-fifth of the diameter forward of the aft side of the rudder post.  The positions may, perhaps, differ somewhat from this rule without  appreciably affecting the performance, but, if any alteration be made, it  would probably be better to put the screws a little farther aft rather than  forward. The forward edges of the blades are from 2 ft. to 3 ft. clear of  the legs of the bracket which carries the after bearing. The transverse  positions are decided, to some extent, by the distance between the center  lines of the engines. As regards propulsive efficiency, it would appear  that the nearer the screws are to the middle line, the less is the  resistance due to the shaft tubes and brackets, and the greater is the gain  from the wake in the screw efficiency, but, on the other hand, the greater  is the augment of the ship's resistance, due to the action of the screws.  Further, the nearer the screws are to the hull, the less are they exposed.  But experience is not wanting to show that the vibration may be troublesome  when the blades come within a few inches of the hull. The average of the  clearances between the tips of the blades and the respective hulls is about  one-eighth of the diameter of the screw.    An interesting and noteworthy fact in connection with these propellers is  the wide differences in the pitches and revolutions, though the products of  the two do not greatly vary. Such differences are extremely rare in the  mercantile marine for similar speeds, but in war ships they are inseparable  from the conditions of the engine design. As a general rule, with  (revolutions x pitch) a constant, an increase of revolutions and the  consequent decrease of pitch allow a diminution of disk and of blade  area--other modifying conditions, such as the thrust, slip, number, and  pattern of blades, being the same. The screws for E and F are interesting,  because, with practically the same speeds and slips, there is a  considerable difference in the revolutions. It will be observed that F is a  vessel of finer form and a little less displacement than E, and, therefore,  has less resistance. Although E has the greater resistance and the screw  the smaller pitch/diameter, the higher revolutions permit the use of a  smaller screw. But from this example the influence of the high revolutions  in diminishing the size of screw does not appear so great as some empirical  rules would indicate. The screws for A and B are also worthy of attention.  Although the ship A has a much greater resistance than B, the screw of the  former is much the smaller, both in the blade area and the disk. A's  screws, however, in addition to 22 per cent. more revolutions"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#4)"],[1," with Mr. Blake, whom this small  opposition seemed to have at once determined.    \"O my God!\" she murmured to herself, \"who could have foreseen this.\"  And ignoring my presence with all the egotism of extreme agitation, she  hurried past me to the room above, where I speedily joined her.        CHAPTER III. THE CONTENTS OF A BUREAU DRAWER    Mr. Blake was standing in the centre of the room when I entered,  carelessly following with his eyes the motion of Mr. Gryce's finger as  that gentleman pointed with unwearying assiduity to the various little  details that had struck us. His hat was still in his hand, and he  presented a very formidable and imposing appearance, or so Mrs. Daniels  appeared to think as she stood watching him from the corner, whither she  had withdrawn herself.    \"A forcible departure you see,\" exclaimed Mr. Gryce; \"she had not even  time to gather up her clothes;\" and with a sudden movement he stooped  and pulled out one of the bureau drawers before the eyes of his  nonchalant listener.    Immediately a smothered exclamation struck our ears, and Mrs. Daniels  started forward.    \"I pray, gentlemen,\" she entreated, advancing in such a way as to place  herself against the front of the bureau in a manner to preclude the  opening of any more drawers, \"that you will remember that a modest woman  such as this girl was, would hardly like to have her clothing displayed  before the eyes of strangers.\"    Mr. Gryce instantly closed the drawer.    \"You are right,\" said he; \"pardon the rough ways of a somewhat hardened  officer of the law.\"    She drew up closer to the bureau, still protecting it with her meagre  but energetic form while her eyes rested with almost a savage expression  upon the master of the house as if he, and not the detective, had been  the aggressor whose advances she feared.    Mr. Blake did not return the look.    \"If that is all you can show me, I think I will proceed to my  appointment,\" said he. \"The matter does seem to be more serious than I  thought, and if you judge it necessary to take any active measures, why,  let no consideration of my great and inherent dislike to notoriety of  any kind, interfere with what you consider your duty. As for the house,  it is at your command, under Mrs. Daniels' direction. Good morning.\" And  returning our bows with one singularly impressive for all its elegant  carelessness, he at once withdrew.    Mrs. Daniels took one long deep breath and came from the bureau.  Instantly Mr. Gryce stooped and pulled out the drawer she had so visibly  protected. A white towel met our eyes, spread neatly out at its full  length. Lifting it, we looked beneath. A carefully folded dress of dark  blue silk, to all appearance elegantly made, confronted our rather  eager eyes. Beside it, a collar of exquisite lace--I know enough of such  matters to be a judge--pricked through by a gold breast-pin of a strange  and unique pattern. A withered bunch of what appeared to have been a  bouquet of red roses, surmounted the whole, giving to the otherwise  commonplace collection the appearance of a relic from the tomb.    We both drew back in some amazement, involuntarily glancing up at Mrs.  Daniels.    \"I have no explanation to give,\" said that woman, with a calmness  strangely in contrast to the agitation she had displayed while Mr. Blake  had remained in the room. \"That those things rich as they are, really  belonged to the girl, I have no doubt. She brought them when she came,  and they only confirm what I have before intimated: that she was no  ordinary sewing girl, but a woman who had seen better days.\"    With a low \"humph!\" and another glance at the dark blue dress and  delicate collar, Mr. Gryce carefully replaced the cloth he had taken  from them, and softly closed the drawer without either of us having laid  a finger upon a single article. Five minutes later he disappeared from  the room.    I did not see him again till occasion took me below, when I beheld him  softly issue from Mr. Blake's private apartment. Meeting me, he smiled,  and I saw that whether he was conscious of betraying it or not, he had  come upon some clue or at the least fashioned for himself some theory  with which he was more or less satisfied.    \"An elegant apartment, that,\" whispered he, nodding sideways toward the  room he had just left, \"pity you haven't time to examine it.\"    \"Are you sure that I haven't?\" returned I, drawing a step nearer to  escape the eyes of Mrs. Daniels who had descended after me.    \"Quite sure;\" and we hastened down together into the yard.    But my curiosity once aroused in this way would not let me rest. Taking  an opportunity when Mr. Gryce was engaged in banter with the girls  below, and in this way learning more in a minute of what he wanted to  know than some men would gather in an hour by that or any other method,  I stole lightly back and entered this room.    I almost started in my surprise. Instead of the luxurious apartment I  had prepared myself to behold, a plain, scantily-furnished room opened  before me, of a nature between a library and a studio. There was not  even a carpet on the polished floor, only a rug, which strange to say  was not placed in the centre of the room or even before the fireplace,  but on one side, and directly in front of a picture that almost at first  blush had attracted my attention as being the only article in the room  worth looking at. It was the portrait of a woman, handsome, haughty and  alluring; a modern beauty, with eyes of fire burning beneath high piled  locks of jetty blackness, that were only relieved from being too intense  by the scarlet hood of an opera cloak, that was drawn over them. \"A  sister,\" I thought to myself, \"it is too modern for his mother,\" and I  took a step nearer to see if I could trace any likeness in the chiselled  features of this disdainful brunette, to the more characteristic ones  of the careless gentleman who had stood but a few moments before in my  presence. As I did so, I was struck with the distance with which  the picture stood out from the wall, and thought to myself that  the awkwardness of the framing came near marring the beauty of this  otherwise lovely work of art. As for the likeness I was in search of, I  found it or thought I did, in the expression of the eyes which were  of the same color as Mr. Blake's but more full and passionate; and  satisfied that I had exhausted all the picture could tell me, I  turned to make what other observations I could, when I was startled by  confronting the agitated countenance of Mrs. Daniels who had entered  behind me.    \"This is Mr. Blake's room,\" said she with dignity; \"no one ever intrudes  here but myself, not even the servants.\"    \"I beg pardon,\" said I, glancing around in vain for the something which  had awakened that look of satisfaction in Mr. Gryce's eyes. \"I was  attracted by the beauty of this picture visible through the half open  door and stepped in to favor myself with a nearer view. It is very  lovely. A sister of Mr. Blake?\"    \"No, his cousin;\" and she closed the door after us with an emphasis that  proclaimed she was anything but pleased.    It was my last effort to obtain information on my own account. In a few  moments later Mr. Gryce appeared from below, and a conversation ensued  with Mrs. Daniels that absorbed my whole attention.    \"You are very anxious, my man here tells me, that this girl should be  found?\" remarked Mr. Gryce; \"so much so that you are willing to defray  all the expenses of a search?\"    She bowed. \"As far as I am able sir; I have a few hundreds in the  bank, you are welcome to them. I would not keep a dollar back if I  had thousands, but I am poor, and can only promise you what I myself  possess; though--\" and her cheeks grew flushed and hot with an unnatural  agitation--\"I believe that thousands would not be lacking if they were  found necessary. I--I could almost swear you shall have anything in  reason which you require; only the girl must be found and soon.\"    \"Have you thought,\" proceeded Mr. Gryce, utterly ignoring the wildness  of these statements, \"that the girl may come back herself if let alone?\"    \"She will come back if she can,\" quoth Mrs. Daniels.    \"Did she seem so well satisfied with her home as to warrant you in  saying that?\"    \"She liked her home, but she loved me,\" returned the woman steadily.  \"She loved me so well she would never have gone as she did without being  forced. Yes,\" said she, \"though she made no outcry and stopped to put  on her bonnet and shawl. She was not a girl to make a fuss. If they had  killed her outright, she would never have uttered a cry.\"    \"Why do you say they?\"    \"Because I am confident I heard more than one man's voice in her room.\"    \"Humph! Would you know those voices if you heard them again?\"    \"No.\"    There was a surprise in this last negative which Mr. Gryce evidently  noticed.    \"I ask,\" said he, \"because I have been told that Mr. Blake lately kept a  body servant who has been seen to look at this girl more than once, when  she has passed him on the stairs.\"    Mrs. Daniels' face turned scarlet with rage and she hastily rose from  the chair. \"I don't believe it,\" said she; \"Henry was a man who knew his  place, and--I won't hear such things,\" she suddenly exclaimed; \"Emily  was--was a lady, and--\"    \"Well, well,\" interposed Mr. Gryce soothingly, \"though the cat looks at  the king, it is no sign the king looks at the cat. We have to think of  everything you know.\"    \"You must never think of anything like that.\"    Mr. Gryce softly ran his thumb around the brim of the hat he held in his  hand. \"Mrs. Daniels,\" observed he, \"it would greatly facilitate matters  if you would kindly tell us why you take such an interest in this girl.  One glimpse at her real history would do more towards setting us on the  right track than anything else you could offer.\"    Her face assumed an unmistakable frown. \"Have I not told you,\" said"]]]
