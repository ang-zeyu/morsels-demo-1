Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and  cheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had  become displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously  fascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out at  an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax  and painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might  better have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his  left hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no  inconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small,  scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently  developed, and his thighs as thick as any athlete's. Still, the most  remarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous  intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and  pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people  imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I  knew him to be as sane as I was.    I do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that  cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was  certainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature,  nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this  surly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I  was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde  squatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with  excitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the  stove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move  she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang  into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the  floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the  cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and  curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_ eccentric.    Mr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face,  picked up a dog's-eared ledger and opened it.    \"Henry B. Matthews,\" he read, \"book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and  Company, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation  damaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be repaired  by August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars.\" He turned the page and ran his  fingerless knuckles down the closely-written columns.    \"P. Greene Dusenberry, Minister of the Gospel, Fairbeach, New Jersey.  Reputation damaged in the Bowery. To be repaired as soon as possible.  Retainer $100.\"    He coughed and added, \"Called, April 6th.\"    \"Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde,\" I inquired.    \"Listen,\" he coughed again.    \"Mrs. C. Hamilton Chester, of Chester Park, New York City. Called April  7th. Reputation damaged at Dieppe, France. To be repaired by October 1st  Retainer $500.    \"Note.--C. Hamilton Chester, Captain U.S.S. 'Avalanche', ordered home  from South Sea Squadron October 1st.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is  lucrative.\"    His colourless eyes sought mine, \"I only wanted to demonstrate that I  was correct. You said it was impossible to succeed as a Repairer of  Reputations; that even if I did succeed in certain cases it would cost  me more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my  employ, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm  which possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and grade  of society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social temples;  others are the prop and pride of the financial world; still others, hold  undisputed sway among the 'Fancy and the Talent.' I choose them at my  leisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough,  they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I  wished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of  their fellow-citizens, I have in my pay.\"    \"They may turn on you,\" I suggested.    He rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax  substitutes. \"I think not,\" he murmured thoughtfully, \"I seldom have to  apply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages.\"    \"How do you apply the whip?\" I demanded.    His face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a pair  of green sparks.    \"I invite them to come and have a little chat with me,\" he said in a soft  voice.    A knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable  expression.    \"Who is it?\" he inquired.    \"Mr. Steylette,\" was the answer.    \"Come to-morrow,\" replied Mr. Wilde.    \"Impossible,\" began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from  Mr. Wilde.    \"Come to-morrow,\" he repeated.    We heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the  stairway.    \"Who is that?\" I asked.    \"Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York  daily.\"    He drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: \"I pay him very  badly, but he thinks it a good bargain.\"    \"Arnold Steylette!\" I repeated amazed.    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.    The cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at  him and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the  floor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased  snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in  timbre as he stroked her. \"Where are the notes?\" I asked. He pointed to  the table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of  manuscript entitled--    \"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA.\"    One by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling,  and although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, \"When from Carcosa,  the Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran,\" to \"Castaigne, Louis de Calvados,  born December 19th, 1877,\" I read it with an eager, rapt attention,  pausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially on \"Hildred  de Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe Landes Castaigne,  first in succession,\" etc., etc.    When I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.    \"Speaking of your legitimate ambition,\" he said, \"how do Constance and  Louis get along?\"    \"She loves him,\" I replied simply.    The cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he flung  her off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.    \"And Dr. Archer! But that's a matter you can settle any time you wish,\"  he added.    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin  Louis.\"    \"It is time,\" he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table and  ran over the leaves rapidly. \"We are now in communication with ten  thousand men,\" he muttered. \"We can count on one hundred thousand within  the first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will  rise _en masse_. The country follows the state, and the portion that  will not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never have  been inhabited. I shall not send them the Yellow Sign.\"    The blood rushed to my head, but I only answered, \"A new broom sweeps  clean.\"    \"The ambition of Caesar and of Napoleon pales before that which could not  rest until it had seized the minds of men and controlled even their  unborn thoughts,\" said Mr. Wilde.    \"You are speaking of the King in Yellow,\" I groaned, with a shudder.    \"He is a king whom emperors have served.\"    \"I am content to serve him,\" I replied.    Mr. Wilde sat rubbing his ears with his crippled hand. \"Perhaps Constance  does not love him,\" he suggested.    I started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the street  below drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly in  garrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the manoeuvres in  Westchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It was  my cousin's regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their pale  blue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding breeches with  the double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed moulded. Every  other squadron was armed with lances, from the metal points of which  fluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed, playing the  regimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the horses crowding  and trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and the pennons  fluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode with the  beautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their bloodless  campaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of their sabres  against the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines was delightful  to me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as handsome an  officer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a chair by the  window, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and looked straight  at Hawberk's shop as he passed, and I could see the flush on his brown  cheeks. I think Constance must have been at the window. When the last  troopers had clattered by, and the last pennons vanished into South Fifth  Avenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair and dragged the chest away  from the door.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is time that you saw your cousin Louis.\"    He unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into  the corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on  something soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at  the cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and  the beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde's room.    Passing Hawberk's door again I saw him still at work on the armour, but  I did not stop, and stepping out into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#3)"],[1,"the man clapped a  hand roughly over the mouth.    \"Not until we are farther from land, my dear,\" he said.   \"Then you may  yell your pretty head off.\"    Lady Greystoke turned to look into the leering, bearded face so close  to hers.  The man relaxed the pressure of his fingers upon her lips,  and with a little moan of terror as she recognized him the girl shrank  away from her captor.    \"Nikolas Rokoff!  M.  Thuran!\" she exclaimed.    \"Your devoted admirer,\" replied the Russian, with a low bow.    \"My little boy,\" she said next, ignoring the terms of  endearment--\"where is he?  Let me have him.  How could you be so  cruel--even as you--Nikolas Rokoff--cannot be entirely devoid of mercy  and compassion?  Tell me where he is.  Is he aboard this ship?  Oh,  please, if such a thing as a heart beats within your breast, take me to  my baby!\"    \"If you do as you are bid no harm will befall him,\" replied Rokoff.  \"But remember that it is your own fault that you are here.   You came  aboard voluntarily, and you may take the consequences.   I little  thought,\" he added to himself, \"that any such good luck as this would  come to me.\"    He went on deck then, locking the cabin-door upon his prisoner, and for  several days she did not see him.  The truth of the matter being that  Nikolas Rokoff was so poor a sailor that the heavy seas the Kincaid  encountered from the very beginning of her voyage sent the Russian to  his berth with a bad attack of sea-sickness.    During this time her only visitor was an uncouth Swede, the Kincaid's  unsavoury cook, who brought her meals to her.   His name was Sven  Anderssen, his one pride being that his patronymic was spelt with a  double \"s.\"    The man was tall and raw-boned, with a long yellow moustache, an  unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails.   The very sight of him with  one grimy thumb buried deep in the lukewarm stew, that seemed, from the  frequency of its repetition, to constitute the pride of his culinary  art, was sufficient to take away the girl's appetite.    His small, blue, close-set eyes never met hers squarely.   There was a  shiftiness of his whole appearance that even found expression in the  cat-like manner of his gait, and to it all a sinister suggestion was  added by the long slim knife that always rested at his waist, slipped  through the greasy cord that supported his soiled apron.  Ostensibly it  was but an implement of his calling; but the girl could never free  herself of the conviction that it would require less provocation to  witness it put to other and less harmless uses.    His manner toward her was surly, yet she never failed to meet him with  a pleasant smile and a word of thanks when he brought her food to her,  though more often than not she hurled the bulk of it through the tiny  cabin port the moment that the door closed behind him.    During the days of anguish that followed Jane Clayton's imprisonment,  but two questions were uppermost in her mind--the whereabouts of her  husband and her son.  She fully believed that the baby was aboard the  Kincaid, provided that he still lived, but whether Tarzan had been  permitted to live after having been lured aboard the evil craft she  could not guess.    She knew, of course, the deep hatred that the Russian felt for the  Englishman, and she could think of but one reason for having him  brought aboard the ship--to dispatch him in comparative safety in  revenge for his having thwarted Rokoff's pet schemes, and for having  been at last the means of landing him in a French prison.      Tarzan, on his part, lay in the darkness of his cell, ignorant of the  fact that his wife was a prisoner in the cabin almost above his head.    The same Swede that served Jane brought his meals to him, but, though  on several occasions Tarzan had tried to draw the man into  conversation, he had been unsuccessful.   He had hoped to learn through  this fellow whether his little son was aboard the Kincaid, but to every  question upon this or kindred subjects the fellow returned but one  reply, \"Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard.\" So after several  attempts Tarzan gave it up.    For weeks that seemed months to the two prisoners the little steamer  forged on they knew not where.  Once the Kincaid stopped to coal, only  immediately to take up the seemingly interminable voyage.    Rokoff had visited Jane Clayton but once since he had locked her in the  tiny cabin.  He had come gaunt and hollow-eyed from a long siege of  sea-sickness.  The object of his visit was to obtain from her her  personal cheque for a large sum in return for a guarantee of her  personal safety and return to England.    \"When you set me down safely in any civilized port, together with my  son and my husband,\" she replied, \"I will pay you in gold twice the  amount you ask; but until then you shall not have a cent, nor the  promise of a cent under any other conditions.\"    \"You will give me the cheque I ask,\" he replied with a snarl, \"or  neither you nor your child nor your husband will ever again set foot  within any port, civilized or otherwise.\"    \"I would not trust you,\" she replied.  \"What guarantee have I that you  would not take my money and then do as you pleased with me and mine  regardless of your promise?\"    \"I think you will do as I bid,\" he said, turning to leave the cabin.  \"Remember that I have your son--if you chance to hear the agonized wail  of a tortured child it may console you to reflect that it is because of  your stubbornness that the baby suffers--and that it is your baby.\"    \"You would not do it!\" cried the girl.  \"You would not--could not be so  fiendishly cruel!\"    \"It is not I that am cruel, but you,\" he returned, \"for you permit a  paltry sum of money to stand between your baby and immunity from  suffering.\"    The end of it was that Jane Clayton wrote out a cheque of large  denomination and handed it to Nikolas Rokoff, who left her cabin with a  grin of satisfaction upon his lips.    The following day the hatch was removed from Tarzan's cell, and as he  looked up he saw Paulvitch's head framed in the square of light above  him.    \"Come up,\" commanded the Russian.  \"But bear in mind that you will be  shot if you make a single move to attack me or any other aboard the  ship.\"    The ape-man swung himself lightly to the deck.  About him, but at a  respectful distance, stood a half-dozen sailors armed with rifles and  revolvers.  Facing him was Paulvitch.    Tarzan looked about for Rokoff, who he felt sure must be aboard, but  there was no sign of him.    \"Lord Greystoke,\" commenced the Russian, \"by your continued and wanton  interference with M.  Rokoff and his plans you have at last brought  yourself and your family to this unfortunate extremity.  You have only  yourself to thank.   As you may imagine, it has cost M.  Rokoff a large  amount of money to finance this expedition, and, as you are the sole  cause of it, he naturally looks to you for reimbursement.    \"Further, I may say that only by meeting M.  Rokoff's just demands may  you avert the most unpleasant consequences to your wife and child, and  at the same time retain your own life and regain your liberty.\"    \"What is the amount?\" asked Tarzan.  \"And what assurance have I that  you will live up to your end of the agreement?  I have little reason to  trust two such scoundrels as you and Rokoff, you know.\"    The Russian flushed.    \"You are in no position to deliver insults,\" he said.   \"You have no  assurance that we will live up to our agreement other than my word, but  you have before you the assurance that we can make short work of you if  you do not write out the cheque we demand.    \"Unless you are a greater fool than I imagine, you should know that  there is nothing that would give us greater pleasure than to order  these men to fire.  That we do not is because we have other plans for  punishing you that would be entirely upset by your death.\"    \"Answer one question,\" said Tarzan.  \"Is my son on board this ship?\"    \"No,\" replied Alexis Paulvitch, \"your son is quite safe elsewhere; nor  will he be killed until you refuse to accede to our fair demands.  If  it becomes necessary to kill you, there will be no reason for not  killing the child, since with you gone the one whom we wish to punish  through the boy will be gone, and he will then be to us only a constant  source of danger and embarrassment.  You see, therefore, that you may  only save the life of your son by saving your own, and you can only  save your own by giving us the cheque we ask.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Tarzan, for he knew that he could trust them to  carry out any sinister threat that Paulvitch had made, and there was a  bare chance that by conceding their demands he might save the boy.    That they would permit him to live after he had appended his name to  the cheque never occurred to him as being within the realms of  probability.  But he was determined to give them such a battle as they  would never forget, and possibly to take Paulvitch with him into  eternity.  He was only sorry that it was not Rokoff.    He took his pocket cheque-book and fountain-pen from his pocket.    \"What is the amount?\" he asked.    Paulvitch named an enormous sum.  Tarzan could scarce restrain a smile.    Their very cupidity was to prove the means of their undoing, in the  matter of the ransom at least.  Purposely he hesitated and haggled over  the amount, but Paulvitch was obdurate.   Finally the ape-man wrote out  his cheque for a larger sum than stood to his credit at the bank.    As he turned to hand the worthless slip of paper to the Russian his  glance chanced to pass across the starboard bow of the Kincaid.  To his  surprise he saw that the ship lay within a few hundred yards of land.  Almost down to the water's edge ran a dense tropical jungle, and behind  was higher land clothed in forest.    Paulvitch noted the direction of his gaze.    \"You are to be set at liberty here,\" he said."]]]
