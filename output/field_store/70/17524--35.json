[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/871"],[0,"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes (#3)"],[1,"is the chastisement of those who accept it not? To be as they  are. Is any discontented with being alone? let him be in solitude. Is  any discontented with his parents? let him be a bad son, and lament. Is  any discontented with his children? let him be a bad father.--\"Throw  him into prison!\"--What prison?--Where he is already: for he is there  against his will; and wherever a man is against his will, that to him is  a prison. Thus Socrates was not in prison, since he was there with his  own consent.          XXXIII    Knowest thou what a speck thou art in comparison with the  Universe?---That is, with respect to the body; since with respect to  Reason, thou art not inferior to the Gods, nor less than they. For the  greatness of Reason is not measured by length or height, but by the  resolves of the mind. Place then thy happiness in that wherein thou art  equal to the Gods.          XXXIV    Asked how a man might eat acceptably to the Gods, Epictetus replied:--If  when he eats, he can be just, cheerful, equable, temperate, and orderly,  can he not thus eat acceptably to the Gods? But when you call for warm  water, and your slave does not answer, or when he answers brings it  lukewarm, or is not even found to be in the house at all, then not to be  vexed nor burst with anger, is not that acceptable to the Gods?    \"But how can one endure such people?\"    Slave, will you not endure your own brother, that has God to his  forefather, even as a son sprung from the same stock, and of the same  high descent as yourself? And if you are stationed in a high position,  are you therefor forthwith set up for a tyrant? Remember who you are,  and whom you rule, that they are by nature your kinsmen, your brothers,  the offspring of God.    \"But I paid a price for them, not they for me.\"    Do you see whither you are looking--down to the earth, to the pit, to  those despicable laws of the dead? But to the laws of the Gods you do  not look.          XXXV    When we are invited to a banquet, we take what is set before us; and  were one to call upon his host to set fish upon the table or sweet  things, he would be deemed absurd. Yet in a word, we ask the Gods for  what they do not give; and that, although they have given us so many  things!          XXXVI    Asked how a man might convince himself that every single act of his was  under the eye of God, Epictetus answered:--    \"Do you not hold that things on earth and things in heaven are  continuous and in unison with each other?\"    \"I do,\" was the reply.    \"Else how should the trees so regularly, as though by God's command,  at His bidding flower; at His bidding send forth shoots, bear fruit and  ripen it; at His bidding let it fall and shed their leaves, and folded  up upon themselves lie in quietness and rest? How else, as the Moon  waxes and wanes, as the Sun approaches and recedes, can it be that such  vicissitude and alternation is seen in earthly things?    \"If then all things that grow, nay, our own bodies, are thus bound up  with the whole, is not this still truer of our souls? And if our souls  are bound up and in contact with God, as being very parts and fragments  plucked from Himself, shall He not feel every movement of theirs as  though it were His own, and belonging to His own nature?\"          XXXVII    \"But,\" you say, \"I cannot comprehend all this at once.\"    \"Why, who told you that your powers were equal to God's?\"    Yet God hath placed by the side of each a man's own Guardian Spirit, who  is charged to watch over him--a Guardian who sleeps not nor is deceived.  For to what better or more watchful Guardian could He have committed  which of us? So when you have shut the doors and made a darkness within,  remember never to say that you are alone; for you are not alone, but  God is within, and your Guardian Spirit, and what light do they need to  behold what you do? To this God you also should have sworn allegiance,  even as soldiers unto Caesar. They, when their service is hired, swear  to hold the life of Caesar dearer than all else: and will you not swear  your oath, that are deemed worthy of so many and great gifts? And will  you not keep your oath when you have sworn it? And what oath will you  swear? Never to disobey, never to arraign or murmur at aught that comes  to you from His hand: never unwillingly to do or suffer aught that  necessity lays upon you.    \"Is this oath like theirs?\"    They swear to hold no other dearer than Caesar: you, to hold our true  selves dearer than all else beside.          XXXVIII    \"How shall my brother cease to be wroth with me?\"    Bring him to me, and I will tell him. But to thee I have nothing to say  about his anger.          XXXIX    When one took counsel of Epictetus, saying, \"What I seek is this, how  even though my brother be not reconciled to me, I may still remain as  Nature would have me to be,\" he replied: \"All great things are slow of  growth; nay, this is true even of a grape or of a fig. If then you say  to me now, I desire a fig, I shall answer, It needs time: wait till it  first flower, then cast its blossom, then ripen. Whereas then the fruit  of the fig-tree reaches not maturity suddenly nor yet in a single hour,  do you nevertheless desire so quickly, and easily to reap the fruit of  the mind of man?--Nay, expect it not, even though I bade you!\"          XL    Epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold as being good-for-nothing.  This fellow, by some accident, was afterwards purchased by one of  Caesar's men, and became a shoemaker to Caesar. You should have seen  what respect Epaphroditus paid him then. \"How does the good Felicion?  Kindly let me know!\" And if any of us inquired, \"What is Epaphroditus  doing?\" the answer was, \"He is consulting about so and so with  Felicion.\"--Had he not sold him as good-for-nothing? Who had in a trice  converted him into a wiseacre?    This is what comes of holding of importance anything but the things that  depend on the Will.          XLI    What you shun enduring yourself, attempt not to impose on others. You  shun slavery--beware of enslaving others! If you can endure to do that,  one would think you had been once upon a time a slave yourself. For Vice  has nothing in common with virtue, nor Freedom with slavery.          XLII    Has a man been raised to tribuneship? Every one that he meets  congratulates him. One kisses him on the eyes, another on the neck,  while the slaves kiss his hands. He goes home to find torches burning;  he ascends to the Capitol to sacrifice.--Who ever sacrificed for having  had right desires; for having conceived such inclinations as Nature  would have him? In truth we thank the Gods for that wherein we place our  happiness.          XLIII    A man was talking to me to-day about the priesthood of Augustus. I said  to him, \"Let the thing go, my good Sir; you will spend a good deal to no  purpose.\"    \"Well, but my name will be inserted in all documents and contracts.\"    \"Will you be standing there to tell those that read them, That is my  name written there? And even if you could now be there in every case,  what will you do when you are dead?\"    \"At all events my name will remain.\"    \"Inscribe it on a stone and it will remain just as well. And think,  beyond Nicopolis what memory of you will there be?\"    \"But I shall have a golden wreath to wear.\"    \"If you must have a wreath, get a wreath of roses and put it on; you  will look more elegant!\"          XLIV    Above all, remember that the door stands open. Be not more fearful than  children; but as they, when they weary of the game, cry, \"I will play  no more,\" even so, when thou art in the like case, cry, \"I will play no  more\" and depart. But if thou stayest, make no lamentation.          XLV    Is there smoke in the room? If it be slight, I remain; if grievous,  I quit it. For you must remember this and hold it fast, that the door  stands open.    \"You shall not dwell at Nicopolis!\"    Well and good.    \"Nor at Athens.\"    Then I will not dwell at Athens either.    \"Nor at Rome.\"    Nor at Rome either.    \"You shall dwell in Gyara!\"    Well: but to dwell in Gyara seems to me like a grievous smoke; I depart  to a place where none can forbid me to dwell: that habitation is open  unto all! As for the last garment of all, that is the poor body; beyond  that, none can do aught unto me. This why Demetrius said to Nero: \"You  threaten me with death; it is Nature who threatens you!\"          XLVI    The beginning of philosophy is to know the condition of one's own mind.  If a man recognises that this is in a weakly state, he will not then  want to apply it to questions of the greatest moment. As it is, men who  are not fit to swallow even a morsel, buy whole treatises and try to  devour them. Accordingly they either vomit them up again, or suffer from  indigestion, whence come gripings, fluxions, and fevers. Whereas they  should have stopped to consider their capacity.          XLVII    In theory it is easy to convince an ignorant person: in actual life, men  not only object to offer themselves to be convinced, but hate the man  who has convinced them. Whereas Socrates used to say that we should  never lead a life not subjected to examination.          XLVIII    This is the reason why Socrates, when reminded that he should prepare  for his trial, answered: \"Thinkest thou not that I have been preparing  for it all my life?\"    \"In what way?\"    \"I have maintained that which in me lay!\"    \"How so?\"    \"I have never, secretly or openly, done a wrong unto any.\"          XLIX    In what character dost thou now come forward?    As a witness summoned by God. \"Come thou,\" saith God, \"and testify for  me, for thou art worthy of being brought forward as a witness by Me. Is  aught that is outside thy will either good or bad? Do I hurt any man?  Have I placed the good of each in the power of any other than himself?  What witness dost thou bear to God?\"    \"I am in evil state, Master, I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],[0,"A Man of Means (#3)"],[1," a Frenchman have the laugh of us.\"    It was a long speech for Mr. Potter, and it drew a look of respectful  tenderness from Muriel. \"You're so brave, Mr. Potter,\" she said.    Whether it was the slight emphasis which she put on the first word, or  whether it was sheer generosity that impelled him, one can not say; but  Roland produced the required sum even while she spoke. He offered it to  his rival.    Mr. Potter started, turned a little pale, then drew himself up and waved  the note aside.    \"I take no favors,\" he said with dignity.    There was a pause.    \"Why don't you do it.\" said Albert, nastily. \"Five pounds is nothing to  you.\"    \"Why should I?\"    \"Ah! Why should you?\"    It would be useless to assert that Mr. Potter's tone was friendly. It  stung Roland. It seemed to him that Muriel was looking at him in an  unpleasantly contemptuous manner.    In some curious fashion, without doing anything to merit it, he had  apparently become an object of scorn and derision to the party.    \"All right, then, I will,\" he said suddenly.    \"Easy enough to talk,\" said Albert.    Roland strode with a pale but determined face to the spot where M.  Feriaud, beaming politely, was signing a picture post-card.    Some feeling of compunction appeared to come to Muriel at the eleventh  hour.    \"Don't let him,\" she cried.    But Brother Frank was made of sterner stuff. This was precisely the sort  of thing which, in his opinion, made for a jolly afternoon.    For years he had been waiting for something of this kind. He was  experiencing that pleasant thrill which comes to a certain type  of person when the victim of a murder in the morning paper is an  acquaintance of theirs.    \"What are you talking about?\" he said. \"There's no danger. At least, not  much. He might easily come down all right. Besides, he wants to. What do  you want to go interfering for?\"    Roland returned. The negotiations with the bird-man had lasted a little  longer than one would have expected. But then, of course, M. Feriaud was  a foreigner, and Roland's French was not fluent.    He took Muriel's hand.    \"Good-by,\" he said.    He shook hands with the rest of the party, even with Albert Potter. It  struck Frank that he was making too much fuss over a trifle--and, worse,  delaying the start of the proceedings.    \"What's it all about?\" he demanded. \"You go on as if we were never going  to see you again.\"    \"You never know.\"    \"It's as safe as being in bed.\"    \"But still, in case we never meet again----\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Brother Frank, and took the outstretched hand.           *       *       *       *       *    The little party stood and watched as the aeroplane moved swiftly along  the ground, rose, and soared into the air. Higher and higher it rose,  till the features of the two occupants were almost invisible.    \"Now,\" said Brother Frank. \"Now watch. Now he's going to loop the loop.\"    But the wheels of the aeroplane still pointed to the ground. It grew  smaller and smaller. It was a mere speck.    \"What the dickens?\"    Far away to the West something showed up against the blue of the  sky--something that might have been a bird, a toy kite, or an aeroplane  traveling rapidly into the sunset.    Four pairs of eyes followed it in rapt silence.            THE EPISODE OF THE FINANCIAL NAPOLEON    Second of a Series of Six Stories [First published in _Pictorial  Review_, June 1916]      Seated with his wife at breakfast on the veranda which overlooked the  rolling lawns and leafy woods of his charming Sussex home, Geoffrey  Windlebird, the great financier, was enjoying the morning sun to the  full. His chubby features were relaxed in a smile of lazy contentment;  and his wife, who liked to act sometimes as his secretary, found it  difficult to get him to pay any attention to his morning's mail.    \"There's a column in to-day's _Financial Argus_,\" she said, \"of which  you really must take notice. It's most abusive. It's about the Wildcat  Reef. They assert that there never was any gold in the mine, and that  you knew it when you floated the company.\"    \"They will have their little joke.\"    \"But you had the usual mining-expert's report.\"    \"Of course we had. And a capital report it was. I remember thinking at  the time what a neat turn of phrase the fellow had. I admit he depended  rather on his fine optimism than on any examination of the mine. As a  matter of fact, he never went near it. And why should he? It's down in  South America somewhere. Awful climate--snakes, mosquitoes, revolutions,  fever.\"    Mr. Windlebird spoke drowsily. His eyes closed.    \"Well, the Argus people say that they have sent a man of their own out  there to make inquiries, a well-known expert, and the report will be in  within the next fortnight. They say they will publish it in their next  number but one. What are you going to do about it?\"    Mr. Windlebird yawned.    \"Not to put too fine a point on it, dearest, the game is up. The  Napoleon of Finance is about to meet his Waterloo. And all for twenty  thousand pounds. That is the really bitter part of it. To-morrow we sail  for the Argentine. I've got the tickets.\"    \"You're joking, Geoffrey. You must be able to raise twenty thousand.  It's a flea-bite.\"    \"On paper--in the form of shares, script, bonds, promissory notes, it  is a flea-bite. But when it has to be produced in the raw, in flat, hard  lumps of gold or in crackling bank-notes, it's more like a bite from a  hippopotamus. I can't raise it, and that's all about it. So--St. Helena  for Napoleon.\"    Altho Geoffrey Windlebird described himself as a Napoleon of Finance, a  Cinquevalli or Chung Ling Soo of Finance would have been a more accurate  title. As a juggler with other people's money he was at the head of his  class. And yet, when one came to examine it, his method was delightfully  simple. Say, for instance, that the Home-grown Tobacco Trust, founded by  Geoffrey in a moment of ennui, failed to yield those profits which the  glowing prospectus had led the public to expect. Geoffrey would appease  the excited shareholders by giving them Preference Shares (interest  guaranteed) in the Sea-gold Extraction Company, hastily floated to meet  the emergency. When the interest became due, it would, as likely as not,  be paid out of the capital just subscribed for the King Solomon's Mines  Exploitation Association, the little deficiency in the latter being  replaced in its turn, when absolutely necessary and not a moment before,  by the transfer of some portion of the capital just raised for yet  another company. And so on, ad infinitum. There were moments when it  seemed to Mr. Windlebird that he had solved the problem of Perpetual  Promotion.    The only thing that can stop a triumphal progress like Mr. Windlebird's  is when some coarse person refuses to play to the rules, and demands  ready money instead of shares in the next venture. This had happened  now, and it had flattened Mr. Windlebird like an avalanche.    He was a philosopher, but he could not help feeling a little galled that  the demand which had destroyed him had been so trivial. He had handled  millions--on paper, it was true, but still millions--and here he was  knocked out of time by a paltry twenty thousand pounds.    \"Are you absolutely sure that nothing can be done?\" persisted Mrs.  Windlebird. \"Have you tried every one?\"    \"Every one, dear moon-of-my-delight--the probables, the possibles, the  highly unlikelies, and the impossibles. Never an echo to the minstrel's  wooing song. No, my dear, we have got to take to the boats this time.  Unless, of course, some one possessed at one and the same time of twenty  thousand pounds and a very confiding nature happens to drop from the  clouds.\"    As he spoke, an aeroplane came sailing over the tops of the trees beyond  the tennis-lawn. Gracefully as a bird it settled on the smooth turf, not  twenty yards from where he was seated.           *       *       *       *       *    Roland Bleke stepped stiffly out onto the tennis-lawn. His progress  rather resembled that of a landsman getting out of an open boat in  which he has spent a long and perilous night at sea. He was feeling more  wretched than he had ever felt in his life. He had a severe cold. He had  a splitting headache. His hands and feet were frozen. His eyes smarted.  He was hungry. He was thirsty. He hated cheerful M. Feriaud, who had  hopped out and was now busy tinkering the engine, a gay Provencal air  upon his lips, as he had rarely hated any one, even Muriel Coppin's  brother Frank.    So absorbed was he in his troubles that he was not aware of Mr.  Windlebird's approach until that pleasant, portly man's shadow fell on  the turf before him.    \"Not had an accident, I hope, Mr. Bleke?\"    Roland was too far gone in misery to speculate as to how this genial  stranger came to know his name. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Windlebird,  keen student of the illustrated press, had recognized Roland by his  photograph in the Daily Mirror. In the course of the twenty yards' walk  from house to tennis-lawn she had put her husband into possession of  the more salient points in Roland's history. It was when Mr. Windlebird  heard that Roland had forty thousand pounds in the bank that he sat up  and took notice.    \"Lead me to him,\" he said simply.    Roland sneezed.    \"Doe accident, thag you,\" he replied miserably. \"Somethig's gone wrong  with the worgs, but it's nothing serious, worse luck.\"    M. Feriaud, having by this time adjusted the defect in his engine, rose  to his feet, and bowed.    \"Excuse if we come down on your lawn. But not long do we trespass. See,  _mon ami_,\" he said radiantly to Roland, \"all now O. K. We go on.\"    \"No,\" said Roland decidedly.    \"No? What you mean--no?\"    A shade of alarm fell on M. Feriaud's weather-beaten features. The  eminent bird-man did not wish to part from Roland. Toward Roland he  felt like a brother, for Roland had notions about payment"]]]
