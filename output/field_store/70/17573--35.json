Finally, to top my valor, I have bought sheet music of the lighter kind and  have pronounced the softest titles so that all could hear. But if I desire  the poems of Lovelace or the plays of Marlowe, I sidle close up to the  shopkeeper to get his very ear. If the book is visible, I point my thumb at  it without a word.    It was but the other day--in order to fill a gap in a paper I was  writing--I desired to know the name of an author who is obscure although  his work has been translated into nearly all languages. I wanted to know a  little about the life of the man who wrote _Mary Had a Little Lamb_, which,  I am told, is known by children over pretty much all the western world. It  needed only a trip to the Public Library. Any attendant would direct me to  the proper shelf. Yet once in the building, my courage oozed. My question,  though serious, seemed too ridiculous to be asked. I would sizzle as I  met the attendant's eye. Of a consequence, I fumbled on my own devices,  possibly to the increase of my general knowledge, but without gaining what  I sought.    They had no book in the Bath shop on piracy in Cornwall. I was offered  instead a work in two volumes on the notorious highwaymen of history, and  for a moment my plot swerved in that direction. But I put it by. To pay the  fellow for his pains--for he had dug in barrels to his shoulders and had a  smudge across his nose--I bought a copy of Thomson's \"Castle of Indolence,\"  and in my more energetic moods I read it. And so I came away.    On leaving the shop, lest I should be nipped in a neglect, I visited the  Roman baths. Then I took the waters in the Assembly Room. It was Sam  Weller, you may recall, who remarked, when he was entertained by the select  footmen, that the waters tasted like warm flat-irons. Finally, I viewed  the Crescent around which the shirted Winkle ran with the valorous Dowler  breathing on his neck. With such distractions, as you may well imagine,  Cornish pirates became as naught. Such mental vibration as I had was now  gone toward a tale of fashion in the days when Queen Anne was still alive.  Of a consequence, I again sought the bookshop and stifling my timidity, I  demanded such volumes as might set me most agreeably to my task.    I have in mind also a bookshop of small pretension in a town in Wales. For  purely secular delight, maybe, it was too largely composed of Methodist  sermons. Hell fire burned upon its shelves with a warmth to singe so poor a  worm as I. Yet its signboard popped its welcome when I had walked ten miles  of sunny road. Possibly it was the chair rather than the divinity that  keeps the place in memory. The owner was absent on an errand, and his  daughter, who had been clumping about the kitchen on my arrival, was  uninstructed in the price marks. So I read and fanned myself until his  return.    Perhaps my sluggishness toward first editions--to which I have hinted  above--comes in part from the acquaintance with a man who in a linguistic  outburst as I met him, pronounced himself to be a numismatist and  philatelist. One only of these names would have satisfied a man of less  conceit. It is as though the pteranodon should claim also to be the  spoon-bill dinosaur. It is against modesty that one man should summon all  the letters. No, the numismatist's head is not crammed with the mysteries  of life and death, nor is a philatelist one who is possessed with the  dimmer secrets of eternity. Rather, this man who was so swelled with  titles, eked a living by selling coins and stamps, and he was on his way  to Europe to replenish his wares. Inside his waistcoat, just above his  liver--if he owned so human an appendage--he carried a magnifying glass.  With this, when the business fit was on him, he counted the lines and dots  upon a stamp, the perforations on its edge. He catalogued its volutes, its  stipples, the frisks and curlings of its pattern. He had numbered the very  hairs on the head of George Washington, for in such minutiae did the value  of the stamp reside. Did a single hair spring up above the count, it would  invalidate the issue. Such values, got by circumstance or accident--resting  on a flaw--founded on a speck--cause no ferment of my desires.    For the buying of books, it is the cheaper shops where I most often prowl.  There is in London a district around Charing Cross Road where almost every  shop has books for sale. There is a continuous rack along the sidewalk,  each title beckoning for your attention. You recall the class of  street-readers of whom Charles Lamb wrote--\"poor gentry, who, not having  wherewithal to buy or hire a book, filch a little learning at the open  stalls.\" It was on some such street that these folk practiced their  innocent larceny. If one shopkeeper frowned at the diligence with which  they read \"Clarissa,\" they would continue her distressing adventures across  the way. By a lingering progress up the street, \"Sir Charles Grandison\"  might be nibbled down--by such as had the stomach--without the outlay of  a single penny. As for Gibbon and the bulbous historians, though a whole  perusal would outlast the summer and stretch to the colder months, yet with  patience they could be got through. However, before the end was come even a  hasty reader whose eye was nimble on the page would be blowing on his nails  and pulling his tails between him and the November wind.    But the habit of reading at the open stalls was not only with the poor. You  will remember that Mr. Brownlow was addicted. Really, had not the Artful  Dodger stolen his pocket handkerchief as he was thus engaged upon his book,  the whole history of Oliver Twist must have been quite different. And Pepys  himself, Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., was guilty. \"To Paul's Church Yard,\" he  writes, \"and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy  not, but borrow to read.\" Such parsimony is the curse of authors. To thumb  a volume cheaply around a neighborhood is what keeps them in their garrets.  It is a less offence to steal peanuts from a stand. Also, it is recorded in  the life of Beau Nash that the persons of fashion of his time, to pass a  tedious morning \"did divert themselves with reading in the booksellers'  shops.\" We may conceive Mr. Fanciful Fopling in the sleepy blink of those  early hours before the pleasures of the day have made a start, inquiring  between his yawns what latest novels have come down from London, or whether  a new part of \"Pamela\" is offered yet. If the post be in, he will prop  himself against the shelf and--unless he glaze and nod--he will read  cheaply for an hour. Or my Lady Betty, having taken the waters in the  pump-room and lent her ear to such gossip as is abroad so early, is now  handed to her chair and goes round by Gregory's to read a bit. She is  flounced to the width of the passage. Indeed, until the fashion shall  abate, those more solid authors that are set up in the rear of the shop,  must remain during her visits in general neglect. Though she hold herself  against the shelf and tilt her hoops, it would not be possible to pass. She  is absorbed in a book of the softer sort, and she flips its pages against  her lap-dog's nose.    But now behold the student coming up the street! He is clad in shining  black. He is thin of shank as becomes a scholar. He sags with knowledge. He  hungers after wisdom. He comes opposite the bookshop. It is but coquetry  that his eyes seek the window of the tobacconist. His heart, you may be  sure, looks through the buttons at his back. At last he turns. He pauses on  the curb. Now desire has clutched him. He jiggles his trousered shillings.  He treads the gutter. He squints upon the rack. He lights upon a treasure.  He plucks it forth. He is unresolved whether to buy it or to spend the  extra shilling on his dinner. Now all you cooks together, to save your  business, rattle your pans to rouse him! If within these ancient buildings  there are onions ready peeled--quick!--throw them in the skillet that the  whiff may come beneath his nose! Chance trembles and casts its vote--eenie  meenie--down goes the shilling--he has bought the book. Tonight he will  spread it beneath his candle. Feet may beat a snare of pleasure on the  pavement, glad cries may pipe across the darkness, a fiddle may scratch its  invitation--all the rumbling notes of midnight traffic will tap in vain  their summons upon his window.          Any Stick Will Do To Beat A Dog      Reader, possibly on one of your country walks you have come upon a man with  his back against a hedge, tormented by a fiend in the likeness of a dog.  You yourself, of course, are not a coward. You possess that cornerstone of  virtue, a love for animals. If at your heels a dog sniffs and growls, you  humor his mistake, you flick him off and proceed with unbroken serenity. It  is scarcely an interlude to your speculation on the market. Or if you work  upon a sonnet and are in the vein, your thoughts, despite the beast, run  unbroken to a rhyme. But pity this other whose heart is less stoutly  wrapped! He has gone forth on a holiday to take the country air, to thrust  himself into the freer wind, to poke with his stick for such signs of  Spring as may be hiding in the winter's leaves. Having been grinding in an  office he flings himself on the great round world. He has come out to smell  the earth. Or maybe he seeks a hilltop for a view of the fields that lie  below patched in many colors, as though nature had been sewing at her  garments and had mended the cloth from her bag of scraps.    On such a journey this fellow is travelling when, at a turn of the road, he  hears the sound of barking. As yet there is no dog in sight. He pauses. He  listens. How shall one know whether the sound comes up a wrathful gullet or  whether the dog bays at him impersonally, as at the distant moon? Or maybe  he vents himself upon a stubborn"]]]
