We love modern fairy stories and tales of adventure, but they    are not more pleasing than these ancient stories.      [Illustration: THE PLAIN OF MARATHON]    THE STORY OF THE GREEKS. Our language and our books are full of    memories of Greek and Roman deeds of courage. The story of the Greeks    comes before the story of the Romans, for the Greeks were living in    beautiful cities, with temples and theaters, while the Romans were    still an almost unknown people dwelling on the hills that border the    river Tiber.    MEMORIES OF GREEK COURAGE. The most heroic deeds of the Greeks took    place in a great war between the Greek cities and the kingdom of    Persia about five hundred years before Christ. In those days there was    no kingdom called Greece, such as the geographies now describe.    Instead there were cities, a few of which were ruled by kings, others    by the citizens themselves. These cities banded together when any    danger threatened them. Sometimes one city turned traitor and helped    the enemy against the others. The most dangerous enemy the Greeks had,    until the Romans attacked them, was the kingdom of Persia, which    stretched from the Aegean Sea far into Asia. In the war with the    Persians the Greeks fought three famous battles, at Marathon,    Thermopylae, and Salamis, the stories of which men have always liked    to hear and remember.    PREPARING FOR MARATHON, 490 B.C. To the Athenians belong the    glories of Marathon. They lived where the modern city of Athens now    stands. The ruins of their temples and theaters still attract students    and travelers to Greece. The plain of Marathon lay more than twenty    miles to the northeast, and the roads to it led through mountain    passes. When the Athenians heard that the hosts of the Great King of    Persia were approaching, they sent a runner, Pheidippides by name, to    ask aid of Sparta, a city one hundred and forty miles away, in the    peninsula now called the Morea, where dwelt the sturdiest fighters of    Greece. This runner reached Sparta on the second day, but the Spartans    said it would be against their religious custom to march before the    moon was full. The Athenians saw that they must meet the enemy    alone--one small city against a mighty empire. They called their ten    thousand men together and set out. On the way they were joined by a    thousand more, the whole army of the brave little town of Plataea.      [Illustration: GREEK SOLDIERS IN ARMS From a Greek vase of    about the time of the battle of Marathon]    HOW THE ATHENIANS WERE ARMED. Although the Persians had six times    as many soldiers as the Athenians, they were not so well armed for    hand to hand fighting. Their principal weapon was the bow and arrow,    while the Greeks used the lance and a short sword. The Greek soldier    was protected by his bronze helmet, solid across the forehead and over    the nose; by his breastplate, a leathern or linen tunic covered with    small metal scales, with flaps hanging below his hips; and by greaves    or pieces of metal in front of his knees and shins. He was also    protected by a shield, often long enough to reach from his face to his    knees. According to a strange custom the Athenians were led by ten    generals, each commanding one day in turn.    THE BATTLE-GROUND. Marathon was a plain about two miles wide, lying    between the mountains and the sea. From it two roads ran toward    Athens, one along the shore where the hills almost reached the sea,    the other up a narrow valley and over the mountains. The Athenians    were encamped in this valley, where they could attack the Persians if    they tried to follow the shore road.      The Persians landed from their ships and filled the plain near the    shore. They wanted to fight in the open plain because they had so many    more soldiers than the Athenians and because they meant to use their    horsemen. For some time the Athenians watched the Persians, not    knowing what it was best to do. Half the generals did not wish to risk    a battle, but Miltiades was eager to fight, for he feared that delay    would lead timid citizens or traitors to yield to the Persians. He    finally gained his wish, and on his day of command the battle was    ordered.    THE BATTLE. The Persians by this time had decided to sail around to    the harbor of Athens and had taken their horsemen on board their    ships. When they saw the Greeks coming they drew up their    foot-soldiers in deep masses. The Athenians and their comrades--the    Plataeans--soon began to move forward on the run. The Persians thought    this madness, because the Greeks had no archers or horsemen. But the    Greeks saw that if they moved forward slowly the Persians would have    time to shoot arrows at them again and again.      When the Greeks rushed upon the Persians the soldiers at the two ends    of the Persian line gave way and fled towards the shore. In the    center, where the best Persian soldiers stood, the Greeks were not at    first successful, and were forced to retreat. But those who had been    victorious came to their rescue, attacked the Persians in the rear,    and finally drove them off. The Persians ran into the sea to reach the    ships, and the Athenians followed them. Some of the Greeks were so    eager in the fight that they seized the sides of the ships and tried    to keep them from being rowed away, but the Persians cut at their    hands and made them let go.      [Illustration: THE STRAITS OF SALAMIS Where a great sea-fight    between Greeks and Persians took place]    THE NEWS OF THE VICTORY. The Athenians had won a victory of which    they were so proud that they meant it never should be forgotten. Their    city had suddenly become great through the courage and self-sacrifice    of her citizens. One hundred and ninety-two Greeks had fallen, and on    the battle-field their comrades raised over their bodies a mound of    earth which still marks their tomb. The victors sent the runner    Pheidippides to bear the news to Athens. Over the hills he ran until    he reached the market place, and there, with the message of triumph on    his lips, he fell dead.    OTHER VICTORIES OF THE GREEKS. Marathon was only the beginning of    Greek victories over the Persians, only the first struggle in the long    wars between Europe and Asia. Ten years after Marathon the Spartans    won everlasting glory by their heroic stand at the Pass of Thermopylae  --three hundred Greeks against the mighty army of the Persian king    Xerxes. The barbarian hordes passed over their bodies, took the road    to Athens, burned the city, but were soon beaten in the sea-fight    which took place on the waters lying between the mainland of Athenian    territory and the island of Salamis. This victory was also due to    Athenian courage and leadership, for the Athenians and their leader,    Themistocles, were resolved to stay and fight, although the other    Greeks wanted to sail away.    WHY MARATHON IS REMEMBERED. The victories of Marathon and Salamis    were great not only because small armies of Greeks put to flight the    hosts of Persia, they were great because they saved the independence    of Greece. If the Greeks had become the subjects and slaves of Persia,    they would not have built the wonderful buildings, or carved the    beautiful statues, or written the books which we study and admire.    When we think of the Greeks as our first teachers we feel as proud of    their victories as if they were our own victories.    THE WARS OF THE GREEK CITIES. The Athenians had done the most in    winning the victory over the Persians, and therefore Athens was for    many years the most powerful city in Greece. The Spartans were always    jealous of the Athenians, and in less than a century after the victory    of Marathon they conquered and humbled Athens. The worst faults of the    Greeks were such jealousies and the desire to lord it over one    another. Greek history is full of wars of city against city, Sparta    against Athens, Corinth against Athens, and Thebes against Sparta. In    these wars many heroic deeds were done, of which we like to read, but    it is more important for us to understand how the Greeks lived.          QUESTIONS        1.

The Greeks lived in cities so much of the time that    we do not often think of them as ever living in the country. The    reason for this was that their government and everything else "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/99"],[0,"Collected Articles of Frederick Douglass (#3)"],[1,"I was able to redeem them  by paying to him the amount due for our rides.  This was soon done, for  Mr. Nathan Johnson not only received me kindly and hospitably, but, on  being informed about our baggage, at once loaned me the two dollars with  which to square accounts with the stage-driver.  Mr. and Mrs. Nathan  Johnson reached a good old age, and now rest from their labors.  I am  under many grateful obligations to them.  They not only \"took me in when  a stranger\" and \"fed me when hungry,\" but taught me how to make an honest  living.  Thus, in a fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe  in New Bedford, a citizen of the grand old commonwealth of Massachusetts.    Once initiated into my new life of freedom and assured by Mr. Johnson  that I need not fear recapture in that city, a comparatively unimportant  question arose as to the name by which I should be known thereafter in my  new relation as a free man.  The name given me by my dear mother was no  less pretentious and long than Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.  I  had, however, while living in Maryland, dispensed with the Augustus  Washington, and retained only Frederick Bailey.  Between Baltimore and  New Bedford, the better to conceal myself from the slave-hunters, I had  parted with Bailey and called myself Johnson; but in New Bedford I found  that the Johnson family was already so numerous as to cause some  confusion in distinguishing them, hence a change in this name seemed  desirable.  Nathan Johnson, mine host, placed great emphasis upon this  necessity, and wished me to allow him to select a name for me.  I  consented, and he called me by my present name--the one by which I have  been known for three and forty years--Frederick Douglass.  Mr. Johnson  had just been reading the \"Lady of the Lake,\" and so pleased was he with  its great character that he wished me to bear his name.  Since reading  that charming poem myself, I have often thought that, considering the  noble hospitality and manly character of Nathan Johnson--black man though  he was--he, far more than I, illustrated the virtues of the Douglas of  Scotland.  Sure am I that, if any slave-catcher had entered his domicile  with a view to my recapture, Johnson would have shown himself like him of  the \"stalwart hand.\"    The reader may be surprised at the impressions I had in some way  conceived of the social and material condition of the people at the  North.  I had no proper idea of the wealth, refinement, enterprise, and  high civilization of this section of the country.  My \"Columbian Orator,\"  almost my only book, had done nothing to enlighten me concerning Northern  society.  I had been taught that slavery was the bottom fact of all  wealth.  With this foundation idea, I came naturally to the conclusion  that poverty must be the general condition of the people of the free  States.  In the country from which I came, a white man holding no slaves  was usually an ignorant and poverty-stricken man, and men of this class  were contemptuously called \"poor white trash.\" Hence I supposed that,  since the non-slave-holders at the South were ignorant, poor, and  degraded as a class, the non-slave-holders at the North must be in a  similar condition.  I could have landed in no part of the United States  where I should have found a more striking and gratifying contrast, not  only to life generally in the South, but in the condition of the colored  people there, than in New Bedford. I was amazed when Mr. Johnson told me  that there was nothing in the laws or constitution of Massachusetts that  would prevent a colored man from being governor of the State, if the  people should see fit to elect him.  There, too, the black man's children  attended the public schools with the white man's children, and apparently  without objection from any quarter.  To impress me with my security from  recapture and return to slavery, Mr. Johnson assured me that no  slave-holder could take a slave out of New Bedford; that there were men  there who would lay down their lives to save me from such a fate.    The fifth day after my arrival, I put on the clothes of a common laborer,  and went upon the wharves in search of work.  On my way down Union street  I saw a large pile of coal in front of the house of Rev.  Ephraim  Peabody, the Unitarian minister.  I went to the kitchen door and asked  the privilege of bringing in and putting away this coal.  \"What will you  charge?\" said the lady.  \"I will leave that to you, madam.\"  \"You may put  it away,\" she said.  I was not long in accomplishing the job, when the  dear lady put into my hand TWO SILVER HALF-DOLLARS.  To understand the  emotion which swelled my heart as I clasped this money, realizing that I  had no master who could take it from me,--THAT IT WAS MINE--THAT MY HANDS  WERE MY OWN, and could earn more of the precious coin,--one must have  been in some sense himself a slave.  My next job was stowing a sloop at  Uncle Gid. Howland's wharf with a cargo of oil for New York.  I was not  only a freeman, but a free working-man, and no \"master\" stood ready at  the end of the week to seize my hard earnings.    The season was growing late and work was plenty.  Ships were being fitted  out for whaling, and much wood was used in storing them.  The sawing this  wood was considered a good job.  With the help of old Friend Johnson  (blessings on his memory) I got a saw and \"buck,\" and went at it.  When I  went into a store to buy a cord with which to brace up my saw in the  frame, I asked for a \"fip's\" worth of cord.  The man behind the counter  looked rather sharply at me, and said with equal sharpness, \"You don't  belong about here.\" I was alarmed, and thought I had betrayed myself.  A  fip in Maryland was six and a quarter cents, called fourpence in  Massachusetts.  But no harm came from the \"fi'penny-bit\" blunder, and I  confidently and cheerfully went to work with my saw and buck.  It was new  business to me, but I never did better work, or more of it, in the same  space of time on the plantation for Covey, the negro-breaker, than I did  for myself in these earliest years of my freedom.    Notwithstanding the just and humane sentiment of New Bedford three and  forty years ago, the place was not entirely free from race and color  prejudice.  The good influence of the Roaches, Rodmans, Arnolds,  Grinnells, and Robesons did not pervade all classes of its people.  The  test of the real civilization of the community came when I applied for  work at my trade, and then my repulse was emphatic and decisive.  It so  happened that Mr. Rodney French, a wealthy and enterprising citizen,  distinguished as an anti-slavery man, was fitting out a vessel for a  whaling voyage, upon which there was a heavy job of calking and coppering  to be done.  I had some skill in both branches, and applied to Mr. French  for work.  He, generous man that he was, told me he would employ me, and  I might go at once to the vessel.  I obeyed him, but upon reaching the  float-stage, where others [sic] calkers were at work, I was told that  every white man would leave the ship, in her unfinished condition, if I  struck a blow at my trade upon her.  This uncivil, inhuman, and selfish  treatment was not so shocking and scandalous in my eyes at the time as it  now appears to me.  Slavery had inured me to hardships that made ordinary  trouble sit lightly upon me.  Could I have worked at my trade I could  have earned two dollars a day, but as a common laborer I received but one  dollar.  The difference was of great importance to me, but if I could not  get two dollars, I was glad to get one; and so I went to work for Mr.  French as a common laborer.  The consciousness that I was free--no longer  a slave--kept me cheerful under this, and many similar proscriptions,  which I was destined to meet in New Bedford and elsewhere on the free  soil of Massachusetts.  For instance, though colored children attended  the schools, and were treated kindly by their teachers, the New Bedford  Lyceum refused, till several years after my residence in that city, to  allow any colored person to attend the lectures delivered in its hall.  Not until such men as Charles Sumner, Theodore Parker, Ralph Waldo  Emerson, and Horace Mann refused to lecture in their course while there  was such a restriction, was it abandoned.    Becoming satisfied that I could not rely on my trade in New Bedford to  give me a living, I prepared myself to do any kind of work that came to  hand.  I sawed wood, shoveled coal, dug cellars, moved rubbish from back  yards, worked on the wharves, loaded and unloaded vessels, and scoured  their cabins.    I afterward got steady work at the brass-foundry owned by Mr. Richmond.  My duty here was to blow the bellows, swing the crane, and empty the  flasks in which castings were made; and at times this was hot and heavy  work.  The articles produced here were mostly for ship work, and in the  busy season the foundry was in operation night and day.  I have often  worked two nights and every working day of the week.  My foreman, Mr.  Cobb, was a good man, and more than once protected me from abuse that one  or more of the hands was disposed to throw upon me.  While in this  situation I had little time for mental improvement.  Hard work, night and  day, over a furnace hot enough to keep the metal running like water, was  more favorable to action than thought; yet here I often nailed a  newspaper to the post near my bellows, and read while I was performing  the up and down motion of the heavy beam by which the bellows was  inflated and discharged.  It was the pursuit of knowledge under  difficulties, and I look back to it now, after so many years, with some  complacency and a little wonder that I could have been so earnest and  persevering in any pursuit other than for my daily bread.  I certainly  saw nothing in the conduct of those around to inspire me with such  interest: they were all devoted"]]]
