Basingstoke is a large populous market-town, has a good market for corn,  and lately within a very few years is fallen into a manufacture, viz., of  making druggets and shalloons, and such slight goods, which, however,  employs a good number of the poor people, and enables them to get their  bread, which knew not how to get it before.    From hence the great Western Road goes on to Whitchurch and Andover, two  market-towns, and sending members to Parliament; at the last of which the  Downs, or open country, begins, which we in general, though falsely, call  Salisbury Plain.  But my resolution being to take in my view what I had  passed by before, I was obliged to go off to the left hand, to Alresford  and Winchester.    Alresford was a flourishing market-town, and remarkable for this--that  though it had no great trade, and particularly very little, if any,  manufactures, yet there was no collection in the town for the poor, nor  any poor low enough to take alms of the parish, which is what I do not  think can be said of any town in England besides.    But this happy circumstance, which so distinguished Alresford from all  her neighbours, was brought to an end in the year ---, when by a sudden  and surprising fire the whole town, with both the church and the market-  house, was reduced to a heap of rubbish; and, except a few poor huts at  the remotest ends of the town, not a house left standing.  The town is  since that very handsomely rebuilt, and the neighbouring gentlemen  contributed largely to the relief of the people, especially by sending in  timber towards their building; also their market-house is handsomely  built, but the church not yet, though we hear there is a fund raising  likewise for that.    Here is a very large pond, or lake of water, kept up to a head by a  strong _batter d'eau_, or dam, which the people tell us was made by the  Romans; and that it is to this day part of the great Roman highway which  leads from Winchester to Alton, and, as it is supposed, went on to  London, though we nowhere see any remains of it, except between  Winchester and Alton, and chiefly between this town and Alton.    Near this town, a little north-west, the Duke of Bolton has another seat,  which, though not large, is a very handsome beautiful palace, and the  gardens not only very exact, but very finely situate, the prospect and  vistas noble and great, and the whole very well kept.    From hence, at the end of seven miles over the Downs, we come to the very  ancient city of Winchester; not only the great church (which is so famous  all over Europe, and has been so much talked of), but even the whole city  has at a distance the face of venerable, and looks ancient afar off; and  yet here are many modern buildings too, and some very handsome; as the  college schools, with the bishop's palace, built by Bishop Morley since  the late wars--the old palace of the bishop having been ruined by that  known church incendiary Sir William Waller and his crew of plunderers,  who, if my information is not wrong, as I believe it is not, destroyed  more monuments of the dead, and defaced more churches, than all the  Roundheads in England beside.    This church, and the schools also are accurately described by several  writers, especially by the \"Monasticon,\" where their antiquity and  original is fully set forth.  The outside of the church is as plain and  coarse as if the founders had abhorred ornaments, or that William of  Wickham had been a Quaker, or at least a Quietist.  There is neither  statue, nor a niche for a statue, to be seen on all the outside; no  carved work, no spires, towers, pinnacles, balustrades, or anything; but  mere walls, buttresses, windows, and coigns necessary to the support and  order of the building.  It has no steeple, but a short tower covered  flat, as if the top of it had fallen down, and it had been covered in  haste to keep the rain out till they had time to build it up again.    But the inside of the church has many very good things in it, and worth  observation; it was for some ages the burying-place of the English Saxon  kings, whose _reliques_, at the repair of the church, were collected by  Bishop Fox, and being put together into large wooden chests lined with  lead were again interred at the foot of the great wall in the choir,  three on one side, and three on the other, with an account whose bones  are in each chest.  Whether the division of the _reliques_ might be  depended upon, has been doubted, but is not thought material, so that we  do but believe they are all there.    The choir of the church appears very magnificent; the roof is very high,  and the Gothic work in the arched part is very fine, though very old; the  painting in the windows is admirably good, and easy to be distinguished  by those that understand those things: the steps ascending to the choir  make a very fine show, having the statues of King James and his son King  Charles, in copper, finely cast; the first on the right hand, and the  other on the left, as you go up to the choir.    The choir is said to be the longest in England; and as the number of  prebendaries, canons, &c., are many, it required such a length.  The  ornaments of the choir are the effects of the bounty of several bishops.  The fine altar (the noblest in England by much) was done by Bishop  Morley; the roof and the coat-of-arms of the Saxon and Norman kings were  done by Bishop Fox; and the fine throne for the bishop in the choir was  given by Bishop Mew in his lifetime; and it was well it was for if he had  ordered it by will, there is reason to believe it had never been  done--that reverend prelate, notwithstanding he enjoyed so rich a  bishopric, scarce leaving money enough behind him to pay for his coffin.    There are a great many persons of rank buried in this church, besides the  Saxon kings mentioned above, and besides several of the most eminent  bishops of the See.  Just under the altar lies a son of William the  Conqueror, without any monument; and behind the altar, under a very fine  and venerable monument, lies the famous Lord Treasurer Weston, late Earl  of Portland, Lord High Treasurer of England under King Charles I.  His  effigy is in copper armour at full-length, with his head raised on three  cushions of the same, and is a very magnificent work.  There is also a  very fine monument of Cardinal Beaufort in his cardinal's robes and hat.    The monument of Sir John Cloberry is extraordinary, but more because it  puts strangers upon inquiring into his story than for anything wonderful  in the figure, it being cut in a modern dress (the habit gentlemen wore  in those times, which, being now so much out of fashion, appears mean  enough).  But this gentleman's story is particular, being the person  solely entrusted with the secret of the restoration of King Charles II.,  as the messenger that passed between General Monk on one hand, and Mr.  Montague and others entrusted by King Charles II. on the other hand;  which he managed so faithfully as to effect that memorable event, to  which England owes the felicity of all her happy days since that time; by  which faithful service Sir John Cloberry, then a private musketeer only,  raised himself to the honour of a knight, with the reward of a good  estate from the bounty of the king.    Everybody that goes into this church, and reads what is to be read there,  will be told that the body of the church was built by the famous William  of Wickham; whose monument, intimating his fame, lies in the middle of  that part which was built at his expense.    He was a courtier before a bishop; and, though he had no great share of  learning, he was a great promoter of it, and a lover of learned men.  His  natural genius was much beyond his acquired parts, and his skill in  politics beyond his ecclesiastic knowledge.  He is said to have put his  master, King Edward III., to whom he was Secretary of State, upon the two  great projects which made his reign so glorious, viz.:--First, upon  setting up his claim to the crown of France, and pushing that claim by  force of arms, which brought on the war with France, in which that prince  was three times victorious in battle. (2)  Upon setting up, or  instituting the Order of the Garter; in which he (being before that made  Bishop of Winchester) obtained the honour for the Bishops of Winchester  of being always prelates of the Order, as an appendix to the bishopric;  and he himself was the first prelate of the Order, and the ensigns of  that honour are joined with his episcopal ornaments in the robing of his  effigy on the monument above.    To the honour of this bishop, there are other foundations of his, as much  to his fame as that of this church, of which I shall speak in their  order; but particularly the college in this city, which is a noble  foundation indeed.  The building consists of two large courts, in which  are the lodgings for the masters and scholars, and in the centre a very  noble chapel; beyond that, in the second court, are the schools, with a  large cloister beyond them, and some enclosures laid open for the  diversion of the scholars.  There also is a great hall, where the  scholars dine.  The funds for the support of this college are very  considerable; the masters live in a very good figure, and their  maintenance is sufficient to support it.  They have all separate  dwellings in the house, and all possible conveniences appointed them.    The scholars have exhibitions at a certain time of continuance here, if  they please to study in the new college at Oxford, built by the same  noble benefactor, of which I shall speak in its order.    The clergy here live at large, and very handsomely, in the Close  belonging to the cathedral; where, besides the bishop's palace mentioned  above, are very good houses, and very handsomely built,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#4)"],[1," the  Winchester, Vetterli, Mauser, and other rifles of class 1. It contains  six cartridges, while a seventh can be placed in the trough or carrier,  T.    When the breech is opened by pulling back the bolt, a projection on the  latter strikes the carrier at N, causing its front extremity to raise  the cartridge into the position shown in the section. This movement is  accelerated by the spring, A, acting against a knife-edge projection on  the trough, T; in the upper position of the trough, the spring acts upon  one face of the angle, and upon the other face when in the lower  position.    On closing the breech, the bolt pushes the cartridge into the chamber,  and when the handle is locked down to the right, a part of the bolt  presses against a stud, and thus depresses the trough to be ready to  receive another cartridge from the magazine.    The magazine can be cut off and the rifle used as a single loader by  pushing forward a thumb-piece on the right side of the shoe. The effect  of this is that, on turning down the handle to lock the bolt, the latter  does not act on the stud to depress the carrier, so that no fresh  cartridges are fed up from the magazine.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--LEE MAGAZINE GUN]    There is a projection, Z, on the fore part of the carrier, which keeps  the next cartridge from leaving the magazine while the trough is in the  upper or loading position. A supplementary cartridge stop, R, pivoted at  P and having a spring, L, underneath it, acts in conjunction with Z in  retaining the cartridges in the magazine, and especially in preventing  more than one at a time from passing out into the carrier when the  latter is depressed; it also retains the cartridges in the magazine tube  while the latter is being filled.    _Lee Magazine Rifle_.--This arm (see Fig. 10), which occupied the place  of honor in the report of the American \"Board on Magazine Guns,\"  embodied two new principles of considerable importance, viz., the  central position of the magazine, and having it detachable with ease, so  that two or more magazines can be carried by the soldier.    The breech action of the Lee does not materially differ in design from  other bolt rifles, except that the bolt is in two pieces only--the body,  or bolt proper, and the hammer or cocking-piece. The firing pin, or  striker, is screwed into the hammer; the spiral main spring, which  surrounds the striker, is contained in a hollow in the body. The handle  is placed at the rear end of the bolt, and bent down toward the stock,  so as to allow the trigger to be reached without wholly quitting hold of  the bolt. The extractor is so connected with the bolt head as not to  share the rotation of the latter when the handle is turned down into the  locking position. When the handle is turned up to unlock the bolt, the  hammer is cammed slightly to the rear, by means of oblique bearings on  the bolt and hammer, so as to withdraw the point of the striker within  the face of the bolt. This oblique cam action also gives great power to  the extractor at first starting the empty cartridge case out of the  chamber.    The magazine, M, is simply a sheet iron or steel box of a size to hold  five cartridges, but there seems no reason why it should not be of  larger dimensions. It is detachable from the rifle, and is inserted from  underneath into a slot or mortise in the stock and in the shoe, in front  of the trigger guard. A magazine catch, C, just above the trigger guard,  engages in a notch, N, in the rear of the magazine, the projection, L,  first entering a recess prepared for it in the shoe. There is a magazine  spring, D, at the bottom of the magazine box which pushes the cartridges  up into the shoe. The point of the top cartridge is pushed into the  projection, L, and this keeps the lower cartridges in their places in  the box while the latter is detached; when the magazine is inserted in  the rifle, the withdrawal of the bolt causes the top cartridge to be  slightly drawn back, so that it is now free to be fed up into the shoe  by the magazine spring, D.    There is a later pattern of magazine, which has its front face quite  plain, with no projection, L, as the magazine catch was found sufficient  to hold the box in its place. To prevent the cartridges being pressed  out of the magazine before the latter is inserted in the rifle, there is  a strong spring placed vertically in one side of this box, the curved  upper end of which bears upon the top cartridge; when the magazine is in  its place in the shoe, this side spring is so acted upon that it ceases  to hold down the cartridges in the box.    To use the rifle as a single loader, formerly the magazine had to be  detached, when a spring plate in the shoe, which is pushed aside by the  insertion of the magazine, starts back into its place and nearly fills  the magazine slot, so as to prevent cartridges falling through to the  ground when fed into the chamber by hand. The later pattern, however,  has two notches on the magazine for the catch, C, to engage in. When the  magazine is inserted in the slot only as far as the upper notch, the  rifle can be used only as a single loader, but on pressing the box home  to the second notch, the magazine immediately comes into play.    The magazine can be released from the slot by an upward pressure on the  lower projecting end of the magazine catch, C, which is covered by the  trigger guard.    _Improved Lee_.--This rifle is precisely similar in principle to the  Lee, the chief difference being that the magazine is permanently fixed  in its slot underneath the shoe, and in front of the trigger guard. The  cartridges are inserted from above. There is a stop by means of which  the cartridges can be prevented rising up into the shoe, and which forms  a sort of false bottom to the slot in the latter, so that the arm can be  used as a single loader.    _Lee-Burton_.--The bolt action is the same as the Lee, but the box  magazine is attached to the right side of the shoe, instead of being  underneath, as in that rifle. When the magazine is raised to its higher  position, the cartridges pass successively into the shoe by the action  of gravity alone, and are thus pressed home into the chamber by the  closing of the bolt.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    A number of the Lee-Burton and improved Lee rifles are now being  manufactured for issue to the troops, in order to undergo experimental  trials on an extended scale.    Several other magazine rifles have the box central magazine, but placed  in different positions as regards the shoe and the axis of the bore. In  the original pattern of the Jarman (Sweden and Norway), the magazine is  affixed to the upper part of the shoe, inclined at a considerable angle  to the right hand (see vertical cross section, Fig. 11). Here the  operation of gravity obviates the necessity of a magazine spring, but  the magazine was found to be very much in the way and liable to be  injured. It has therefore been replaced by a magazine underneath the  barrel, as in the Kropatschek and other rifles.--_Engineering_.

For a few weeks' preservation of organic objects in their original form,  dimensions, and color, Prof. Grawitz recommends a mixture composed of 21/2  ounces of chloride of sodium, 23/4 drachms of saltpeter, and 1 pint of  water, to which is to be added 3 per cent. of boric acid.--_Annales des  Travaux Publics_.           *       *       *       *       *          KENT'S TORSION BALANCE.      The United States Torsion Balance Company, of New York, has recently  brought before the public a new form of balance which presents so many  ingenious and excellent features that we illustrate it below, on the  present page. The instrument in its simplest form is shown in Fig. 1. It  consists of a beam, A, which is firmly attached to a wire or band, B, at  right angles to it, and which wire is tightly stretched by any  convenient means. Then, since the wire and beam are both horizontal in  their normal position, and since the center of gravity of the beam is  immediately above or below the middle line of the wire, the torsional  resistance of the latter tends to keep the beam horizontal and to limit  its sensitiveness. When the beam is deflected out of its horizontal  position and the wire thereby twisted, the resistance to twisting  increases with the arc of rotation. To counteract this resistance and to  render the beam sensitive to a very slight excess of load at either end,  a poise, D, is attached to the beam by a standard, C, which poise  carries the center of gravity of the structure above the axis of  rotation. This high center of gravity tends to make the beam \"top  heavy,\" or in unstable equilibrium. By properly proportioning the poise  and its distance above the wire to the resistance of the wire, the  top-heaviness may be made to exactly neutralize the torsional  resistance, and when this is done the beam is infinitely sensitive.    [Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 1.]    The moment of the weight or its tendency to fall increases directly as  the sine of the arc of rotation, while the torsional resistance  increases as the arc, and for small angles the sine and the arc are  practically equal.    When arranged as in Fig. 1, the scale is balanced only when the center  of gravity of the structure is vertically above the middle line of the  wire, and the support of the scale must be leveled in the direction of  the beam, so as to cause the center of gravity to take this normal  position. After the scale is thus leveled, if from any cause whatever,  such as shifting the scale on a table, or shifting the table itself, the  scale support is thrown out of level, the center of gravity of the poise  and beam is shifted from the vertical line above the support, and its  moment immediately becomes greater than the torsional"]]]
