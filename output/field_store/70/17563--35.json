They are  therefore one of the food constituents that help to make fruit valuable  in the diet and should be retained as far as possible in its  preparation. In fact, any method that results in a loss of minerals is  not a good one to adopt in the preparation of fruits.    The minerals commonly found in fruits are iron, lime, sodium, magnesium,  potash, and phosphorus. These are in solution in the fruit juices to a  very great extent, and when the juices are extracted the minerals  remain in them.    17. Acids in Fruit.--Some fruits contain only a small amount of acid,  while others contain larger quantities. It is these acids, together with  the sugar and the volatile oils of fruits, that constitute the entire  flavor of this food. Most ripe fruits contain less acid than unripe  ones, and cooked fruits are often higher in acid than the same  fruits when raw.    Numerous kinds of acid are found in the different varieties of fruits.  For example, lemons, oranges, grapefruit, and a few other fruits  belonging to the class known as citrus fruits contain _citric acid_;  peaches, plums, apricots, and apples, _malic acid_; and grapes and many  other fruits, _tartaric acid_.

The juice of fruits that contain very little sugar and a large  quantity of acid, such as the lemon, may be used for the seasoning of  food in much the same way that vinegar is used. It may also be diluted  with other liquids and used for a beverage. Then, again, various kinds  of fruit juices are subjected to a process of fermentation and, through  the production of another acid, are made into vinegar and wines. When  apples are treated in this way, the fermentation produces _acetic acid_  and, in addition, a certain amount of alcohol. It is on this principle  that the making of wines depends.    19. WATER IN FRUIT.--The water content of fresh fruits is very high,  reaching 94 per cent. in some varieties. Dried fruits, on the other  hand, contain much less water, their content being in some cases as low  as 15 to 20 per cent. It naturally follows that the fruits low in water  are high in food value, while those containing considerable water have  in their composition less of the material that adds food value. The high  percentage of water in fresh fruits, together with the acids they  contain, accounts for the fact that these fruits are so refreshing.  Fruits of this kind, in addition to having this refreshing quality, help  to provide the necessary liquid in the diet.    20. TABLE SHOWING COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF FRUITS.--Just as fruits  vary in their composition, so do they vary in their food value. This  fact is clearly shown in Table I, which gives the percentage of food  substances contained in different fruits and the food value per pound,  in calories, that these fruits contain. As in the table showing the  composition and food value of vegetables given in _Vegetables_, Part 1,  the figures in this table are taken from Atwater's Table of American  Food Materials and refer to the edible part of the material. Reference  to Table I, as progress is made with the study of fruits and their  preparation, will be of much assistance in learning the place that  fruits occupy in the dietary.      FOOD VALUE OF FRUITS    21. EFFECT OF RIPENESS ON FRUITS.--There is a very marked difference  between ripe and green fruits as to their composition, flavor, texture,  palatability, and digestibility. Green fruits, containing more acid than  ripe ones, serve some purposes for which ripe fruits of the same variety  cannot be used so well. For instance, a very much better jelly can be  made from grapes that are not entirely ripe than from those which have  completely ripened. Green fruits contain less sugar than do ripe ones,  and so they are more sour to the taste. In some cases, the carbohydrate  found in green fruits is partly in the form of starch, which in the  process of development is changed to sugar. The cellulose of green  fruits, especially that distributed throughout the pulp of the fruit  itself, is usually tougher and harder than that which is found in the  same fruit after it has ripened.    22. DIGESTIBILITY OF FRUITS.--The ripeness and freshness of fruits  determine their digestibility to a great extent, but the peculiarities  of each person have much to do with this matter. Many times a particular  fruit will agree with almost every one but a few exceptional persons,  and, for no apparent reason except their own peculiarities of digestion,  it disagrees very badly with them. Abnormal conditions of the alimentary  tract, however, cannot be taken into consideration in a general  discussion on the digestibility of foods, for it is a subject that  cannot be treated except from a dietetic standpoint. A safe rule to  follow when a fruit is found to disagree with a person is to omit it  from that person's diet. This need not prove a hardship, for the wide  range, or variety, of fruits makes it possible to find one or more kinds  that will agree with each person.    23. As has been explained, sugar is the food material from which the  nutritive value of fruits is obtained. With the exception of a few  predigested foods, manufactured in such a way that they can be digested  easily, this sugar is probably the most easily digested form of food  that can be obtained. This substance, being held in solution in the  fruit juices, which are encased in a cellulose covering, depends to some  extent for its digestion on the hardness of the cellulose. When this  covering is old and hard or green and tough, as the case may be, it is  difficult for the digestive juices to break through and attack the sugar  contained inside. As this difficulty is not encountered when fruit is  fresh and ripe, its freshness and ripeness become important factors in  digestibility. Cooking is also an important factor because it softens  the cellulose, but there are certain other changes made by cooking that  must be taken into consideration as well.    24. EFFECT OF COOKING ON FRUIT.--Cooking affects fruits in numerous  ways, depending on the condition of the fruit itself, the method used,  and the length of time the heat is applied. When fruits are cooked in  water or in a thin sirup, the cellulose becomes softened. On the other  hand, if they are cooked in a heavy sirup, as, for instance, in the  making of preserves, the cellulose becomes hardened and the fruit,  instead of breaking up, remains whole or nearly so and becomes tough  and hard in texture. The addition of quantities of sugar, as in the  latter case, besides helping to keep the fruit whole, increases its  food value.    25. Another change that usually takes place when fruit is cooked is in  its flavor. This change is due either to an increase in the acid  contained in the fruit or to a decrease in the amount of sugar. Some  authorities believe that cooking increases the amount of acid, while  others hold the view that, when fruit is cooked without removing the  skins and seeds, the acid contained in the seeds and skins and not  noticeable when the fruit is fresh, is released during the cooking. Such  is undoubtedly the case with plums. The change that is brought about in  the sugar by the cooking of fruits consists in changing the cane sugar  into levulose and dextrose, which are not so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],[0,"Riders to the Sea (#3)"],[1," him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came  first on the red mare; and I tried to say \"God speed you,\" but something  choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and \"the blessing of  God on you,\" says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and  I crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it--with fine  clothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.    CATHLEEN [Begins to keen.]    It's destroyed we are from this day. It's destroyed, surely.    NORA Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn't leave her  destitute with no son living?    MAURYA [In a low voice, but clearly.]    It's little the like of him knows of the sea. . . . Bartley will be  lost now, and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of  the white boards, for I won't live after them. I've had a husband, and  a husband's father, and six sons in this house--six fine men, though  it was a hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the  world--and some of them were found and some of them were not found, but  they're gone now the lot of them. . . There were Stephen, and Shawn,  were lost in the great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of  the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of them on the one plank, and  in by that door.    [She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something  through the door that is half open behind them.]    NORA [In a whisper.]    Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in the north-east?    CATHLEEN [In a whisper.]    There's some one after crying out by the seashore.    MAURYA [Continues without hearing anything.]    There was Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in  a dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went  up. There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over.  I was sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees,  and I seen two women, and three women, and four women coming in, and  they crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and  there were men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half  of a red sail, and water dripping out of it--it was a dry day, Nora--and  leaving a track to the door.    [She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It  opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the  threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats  over their heads.]    MAURYA [Half in a dream, to Cathleen.]    Is it Patch, or Michael, or what is it at all?    CATHLEEN Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is  found there how could he be here in this place?    MAURYA There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and  what way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like  him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it's  hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.    CATHLEEN It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after sending us a bit  of his clothes from the far north.    [She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to Michael.  Maurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. NORA looks out.]    NORA They're carrying a thing among them and there's water dripping out  of it and leaving a track by the big stones.    CATHLEEN [In a whisper to the women who have come in.]    Is it Bartley it is?    ONE OF THE WOMEN It is surely, God rest his soul.    [Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in the  body of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and lay  it on the table.]    CATHLEEN [To the women, as they are doing so.]    What way was he drowned?    ONE OF THE WOMEN The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was  washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.    [Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The women  are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement. Cathleen  and Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the  door.]    MAURYA [Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people  around her.]    They're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea can do to  me.... I'll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind  breaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and the  surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises, and they  hitting one on the other. I'll have no call now to be going down and  getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won't care  what way the sea is when the other women will be keening. [To Nora]. Give  me the Holy Water, Nora, there's a small sup still on the dresser.    [Nora gives it to her.]    MAURYA [Drops Michael's clothes across Bartley's feet, and sprinkles the  Holy Water over him.]    It isn't that I haven't prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God.  It isn't that I haven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't  know what I'ld be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's  time surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great sleeping in the  long nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of wet flour we do have to  eat, and maybe a fish that would be stinking.    [She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her  breath.]    CATHLEEN [To an old man.]    Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have  fine white boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would  be found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you'll be working.    THE OLD MAN [Looking at the boards.]    Are there nails with them?    CATHLEEN There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the nails.    ANOTHER MAN It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of the nails, and all  the coffins she's seen made already.    CATHLEEN It's getting old she is, and broken.    [Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of  Michael's clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the  Holy Water.]    NORA [In a whisper to Cathleen.]    She's quiet now and easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could  hear her crying out from this to the spring well. It's fonder she was of  Michael, and would any one have thought that?    CATHLEEN [Slowly and clearly.]    An old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do, and isn't it  nine days herself is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow  in the house?    MAURYA [Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her  hands together on Bartley's feet.]    They're all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty  God have mercy on Bartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and on the  souls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn (bending her head]);  and may He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of every one is  left living in the world.    [She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women,  then sinks away.]    MAURYA [Continuing.]    Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the  Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,  and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all  can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.    [She kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly.]"]]]
