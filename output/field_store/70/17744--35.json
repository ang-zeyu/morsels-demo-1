The original chapel on the east side of the north end of the transept  was also removed to make way for another and much larger one. This is  now used as the cathedral library.    The scheme planned after the second fire having been completed by  about the middle of the thirteenth century, little further work was  undertaken in comparison with that then finished; but before 1250 the  wall of the south aisle of the nave was pierced in four bays, and two  more chapels were added. Then, on the north of the nave, the outer  wall of the aisle was cut through in the second bay, going west from  the transept, and a small chapel was built. The other chapels west of  this one were added during the latter half of the century. In each  case the deeply projecting buttresses which had been introduced  against the earlier walls after the second fire were used, where they  were available, to form parts of the masonry of these new chapels, and  were therefore not disturbed unnecessarily. The old walls having been  altered, and the earlier buttresses being changed in their nature, it  became necessary to carry the original thrust from the nave still  farther out from its source in order to find for it some satisfactory  abutment, and in doing this there was that new force, introduced by  the vaulting of these added chapels, to be reckoned with in addition.  Consequently, to the earlier buttressing more was added. The exact  nature and the approximate date of this work are shown by Professor  Willis in the sections and plan given in his monograph on the  cathedral. The addition to each buttress amounted to an elongation of  it as a pierced wing wall which provided lateral support. Upon the end  of it a greater mass of masonry was introduced to serve as a weight  for steadying the structural device; and this necessary structural  idea was the means of introducing another architectural feature--the  pinnacle. Between the pinnacles of these buttresses rose the gabled  ends of each of the chapels. Professor Willis suggests that a great  part of the work done after the fire of 1186-1187 was completed by the  time of the dedication ceremony in 1199, and he is no doubt a safe  authority to follow. But the nature of many architectural features  tends very strongly to confirm the idea that much of the work in the  ambulatory eastward of the sanctuary had been delayed. It may have  been that the activity which prevailed during the early half of the  thirteenth century was caused by the desire to see this portion of the  church completed; and the energy with which the plea for new interest  and further funds was urged at this time would no doubt be indicative  of a supervening lethargy following on the great effort necessary for  the completion of so much in these few years. But it should be  remembered that these great works of mediaeval art were none of them  built in a day; they represented the accumulation of even centuries of  developing thought and continually improving skill. Therefore must we  realise that after this fire had occurred in 1186-1187 not more than  eleven or twelve years elapsed before the building was again in use  after the consecration in 1199.    _Note_.--For remarks on Chichester Cathedral, see _Archaeologia_,  xvii., pp. 22-28: \"Observations on the Origin of Gothic Architecture.\"  By G. Saunders, 1814.    [Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTIONS FROM WILLIS'S ARCHITECTURAL  HISTORY. North Aisle, original. (Scale 27 1/2 feet to 1 in.) South  Aisle, as now existing.]    This process of reconstruction shows that the mediaeval builders did  not restore in duplication of what had been lost. Where their work was  destroyed they built anew and improved upon what had gone.    We need not suppose that this repair, renewal, and addition had all  been completed when in 1199 Bishop Seffrid II. and six other bishops  again consecrated the church. Doubtless only so much had been done as  was necessary to enable the priests to officiate at an altar provided  for the purpose and the congregation to assemble within the walls; for  the work of building continued with a somewhat persistent  manifestation of energy throughout the whole of the thirteenth  century. Of this activity and enterprise there are many evidences in  proof, both documentary and structural. The documentary evidence  indicating the activity which prevailed after this date is sufficient  to show at least that much was being done; but it does not often  indicate in precise terms what is that particular portion of the  building to which it primarily refers. Early in the thirteenth  century (1207) the king gave Bishop Simon de Welles (1204-1207) his  written permission to bring marble from Purbeck for the repair of his  church at Chichester. He attached to this act of favour certain  conditions which were to prevent any disposal of the material for  other purposes.    John had also two years before given Bakechild Church to the  \"newly-dedicated\" cathedral. Then Bishop Neville, or Ralph II.  (1224-1244), at his death in 1244, \"Dedit cxxx. marcas ad fabricam  Ecclesiae et capellam suam integram cum multis ornamentis.\" Walcott  adds that \"his executors, besides releasing a debt of L60 due to him  and spent on the bell tower, gave L140 to the fabric of the Church,  receiving some benefit in return.\" This cannot be interpreted as  referring to the isolated tower standing apart to the north of the  west front; for, as we shall see, this was not erected until at least  one hundred and fifty years later. In 1232 \"the dean and chapter gave  of their substance. During five years they devoted to the glory and  beauty of the House of the Lord a twentieth part of the income of  every dignity and prebend\"; [3] and then, again, ten years after the  period covered by this act of the chapter the bishops of some other  sees granted indulgences on behalf of the fabric of the church at  Chichester. Bishop Richard of Wych (1245-1253) \"Dedit ad opus  Ecclesiae Circestrensis ecclesias de Stoghton et Alceston, et jus  patronatus ecclesiae de Mundlesham, et pensionem xl. s. in eadem.\" [4]  To this he added a bequest of L40. He had revived in 1249 a statute of  his predecessor, Simon de Welles, and extended \"the capitular  contribution to half the revenues of every prebend, whilst one moiety  of a prebend vacant by death went to the fabric and the rest to the  use of the canons.\" Other means were used to provide funds to continue  the work.      [3] Walcott, \"Early Statutes,\" p. 15.    [4] Walcott, p. 15.    But apart from these many indications of activity, the fabric as it  stands to-day speaks very clearly of the amount of building that went  on between 1200 and 1300. But it was not till 1288-1305 that Bishop  Gilbert de S. Leophardo had added the two new bays of the lady-chapel  eastward.    The fire was the direct cause of most of the work that was done. There  was another, however; for eleven years after the re-dedication, two  of the towers fell. It has been supposed by some that these must have  been the early towers of the west front, both of which still preserve  indications of having been begun during the twelfth century as part of  the original building scheme. It is probable, for reasons that will  appear later, that the two towers of the west front did not collapse  at the time of the second fire, although it would seem from the  Chronicle of Dunstable that their stability may have been impaired in  some measure, since the sole cause for this fall of towers is given in  the words \"impetu venti ceciderunt duae turres Cicestriae.\" [5] But if  these towers had been affected, what of the original central tower?  Its risk of receiving serious damage would be far greater. That no  more than the upper story of one of these can have fallen is evident  from the fact that the south-western tower presents for examination to  this day its original base, and the nature of the upper part of this  same tower shows that it was rebuilt anew daring the first half of the  thirteenth century. It was necessary that the two towers at the west  as well as the central tower should be finished up to a certain level,  for, placed as they were upon the plan, they became essential parts of  the structure, whose absence would diminish the strength of the whole;  hence any desire to maintain the fabric satisfactorily would require  that those of them which fell should receive the immediate attention  of the builders. In the case of the south-west tower we have already  seen what was done, and obviously it was one of the two towers that  had fallen. But what of the other of these? What suggestions remain to  show which it was? It is well known that a central tower had been  erected as part of the original plan, and also that a new upper part  was being added to this same tower about the middle of the thirteenth  century. This new portion eventually rose above the roofs to the level  of the top of the square parapet, about the base of the octagonal  spire, the spire being a still later addition. Now the heightening of  this tower--perhaps with already the idea of a future spire in  view--would raise many questions. Experience would already have taught  the builders that the early central towers of many other churches were  incapable of carrying their own weight. This being so, much less  would it do to suppose that it could bear the addition of new weight  upon the old piers; for though to all appearance sound, the cores were  of rough rubble work, not solidly bedded and not properly bonded with  the ashlar casing. So the question arises, did they remove the whole  or part of the old central tower and piers, or were they saved this  trouble by the structure having shared the fate of many others like  itself, which fell, and so made way for new work? Another tower had  fallen besides the one to which attention has already been drawn; and  as there appears to be nothing to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#4)"],[1,"the bridge, the  captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in  silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing  at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others  were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms  gigantic.    Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly  within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He  heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at  his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The  man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his  own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye  and remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all  famous markmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.    A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was  again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound  of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him  and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued  all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although  no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread  significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the  lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning's work. How coldly  and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and  enforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured  intervals fell those cruel words:    \"Attention, company!... Shoulder arms!... Ready!... Aim!... Fire!\"    Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his  ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the  volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal,  singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched  him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One  lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he  snatched it out.    As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a  long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream--nearer to  safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods  flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels,  turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels  fired again, independently and ineffectually.    The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming  vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and  legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.    \"The officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet's error a  second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has  probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I  cannot dodge them all!\"    An appalling plash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,  rushing sound, _diminuendo_, which seemed to travel back through the air  to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its  deeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him,  blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As  he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard  the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it  was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.    \"They will not do that again,\" he thought; \"the next time they will use  a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will  apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.  That is a good gun.\"    Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top.  The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men  --all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their  colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw.  He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity  of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments  he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream  --the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him  from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one  of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He  dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and  audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could  think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the  bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their  arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate  light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in  their branches the music of aeolian harps. He had no wish to perfect his  escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.    A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head  roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random  farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged  into the forest.    All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The  forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not  even a woodman's road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a  region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.    By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his  wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in  what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a  city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no  dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human  habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both  sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson  in perspective. Over-head, as he looked up through this rift in the  wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange  constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a  secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of  singular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly  heard whispers in an unknown tongue.    His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it he found it horribly  swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had  bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His  tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it  forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf  had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway  beneath his feet!    Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking,  for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a  delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it,  and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have  traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the  wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking  fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At  the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable  joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she  is! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her  he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white  light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then  all is darkness and silence!    Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently  from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.          CHICKAMAUGA    One sunny autumn afternoon a child strayed away from its rude home in a  small field and entered a forest unobserved. It was happy in a new sense  of freedom from control, happy in the opportunity of exploration and  adventure; for this child's spirit, in bodies of its ancestors, had for  thousands of years been trained to memorable feats of discovery and  conquest--victories in battles whose critical moments were centuries,  whose victors' camps were cities of hewn stone. From the cradle of its  race it had conquered its way through two continents and passing a great  sea had penetrated a third, there to be born to war and dominion as a  heritage.    The child was a boy aged about six years, the son of a poor planter. In  his younger manhood the father had been a soldier, had fought against  naked savages and followed the flag of his country into the capital of a  civilized race to the far South. In the peaceful life of a planter the  warrior-fire survived; once kindled, it is never extinguished. The man  loved military books and pictures and the boy had understood enough to  make himself a wooden sword, though even the eye of his father would  hardly have known it for what it was. This weapon he now bore bravely,  as became the son of an heroic race, and pausing now and again in the  sunny space of the forest assumed, with some exaggeration, the postures  of aggression and defense that he had been taught by the engraver's art.  Made reckless by the ease with which he overcame invisible foes  attempting to stay his advance, he committed the common enough military  error of pushing the pursuit to a dangerous extreme, until he found  himself upon the margin of a wide but shallow brook, whose rapid waters  barred his direct advance against the flying foe that had crossed with  illogical ease. But the intrepid victor was not to be baffled; the  spirit of the race which had passed the great sea burned unconquerable  in that small breast and would not be denied. Finding a place where some"]]]
