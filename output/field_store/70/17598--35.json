A good  idea, however, of one of the phases of Berni's humour may be obtained  from the same gentleman's abridgment of the _Animali Parlanti_ of Casti,  in which he has introduced a translation of the Tuscan's description of  himself and of his way of life, out of his additions to Boiardo's poem.  The verses in the prohibited edition of Berni's _Orlando_, in which he  denounced the corruptions of the clergy, have been published, for the  first time in this country, in the notes to the twentieth canto of Mr.  Panizzi's Boiardo. They have all his peculiar wit, together with a  _Lutheran_ earnestness; and shew him, as that critic observes, to have  been \"Protestant at his heart.\"    Since writing this note I have called to mind that a translation of  Berni's account of himself is to be found in Mr. Rose's prose abstract of  the _Innamorato._]      THE ADVENTURES OF ANGELICA.    Argument.    Angelica, daughter of Galafron, king of Cathay, the most beautiful of  womankind, and a possessor of the art of magic, comes, with her brother  Argalia, to the court of Charlemagne under false pretences, in order  to carry away his knights to the country of her father. Her immediate  purpose is defeated, and her brother slain; but all the knights, Orlando  in particular, fall in love with her; and she herself, in consequence of  drinking at an enchanted fountain, becomes in love with Rinaldo. On the  other hand, Rinaldo, from drinking a neighbouring fountain of a reverse  quality, finds his own love converted to loathing. Various adventures  arise out of these circumstances; and the fountains are again drunk, with  a mutual reversal of their effects.    THE ADVENTURES OF ANGELICA    It was the month of May and the feast of Pentecost, and Charlemagne had  ordained a great jousting, which brought into Paris an infinite number of  people, baptised and infidel; for there was truce proclaimed, in order  that every knight might come. There was King Grandonio from Spain, with  his serpent's face; and Ferragus, with his eyes like an eagle; and  Balugante, the emperor's kinsman; and Orlando, and Rinaldo, and Duke  Namo; and Astolfo of England, the handsomest of mankind; and the  enchanter Malagigi; and Isoliero and Salamone; and the traitor Gan, with  his scoundrel followers; and, in short, the whole flower of the chivalry  of the age, the greatest in the world. The tables at which they feasted  were on three sides of the hall, with the emperor's canopy midway at the  top; and at that first table sat crowned heads; and down the table on the  right sat dukes and marquises; and down the table on the left, counts and  cavaliers. But the Saracen nobles, after their doggish fashion, looked  neither for chair nor bench, but preferred a carpet on the floor, which  was accordingly spread for them in the midst.    High sat Charlemagne at the head of his vassals and his Paladins,  rejoicing in the thought of all the great men of which they consisted,  and holding the infidels cheap as the sands which are scattered by the  tempest. To each of his lords, as they drank, he sent round, by his  pages, gifts of enamelled cups of exquisite workmanship; and to every  body some mark of his princely distinction; and so they were all sitting  and hearing music, and feasting off dishes of gold, and talking of lovely  things with low voices,[1] when suddenly there came into the hall four  enormous giants, in the midst of whom was a lady, and behind the lady  there followed a cavalier. She was a very lily of the field, and a rose  of the garden, and a morning-star; in short, so beautiful that the like  had never been seen. There was Galerana in the hall; there was Alda,  the wife of Orlando; and Clarice, and Armellina the kind-hearted, and  abundance of other ladies, all beautiful till she made her appearance;  but after that they seemed nothing. Every Christian knight turned his  face that way; and not a Pagan remained on the floor, but arose and got  as near to her as he could; while she, with a cheerful sweetness, and  a smile fit to enamour a heart of stone, began speaking the following  words:    \"High-minded lord, the renown of your worthiness, and the valour of these  your knights, which echoes from sea to sea, encourages me to hope, that  two pilgrims who have come from the ends of the world to behold you, will  not have encountered their fatigue in vain. And to the end that I may not  hold your attention too long with speaking, let me briefly say, that  this knight here, Uberto of the Lion, a prince renowned also for his  achievements, has been wrongfully driven from out his dominions; and that  I, who was driven out with him, am his sister, whose name is Angelica.  Fame has told us of the jousting this day appointed, and of the noble  press of knights here assembled, and how your generous natures care not  to win prizes of gold or jewels, or gifts of cities, but only a wreath of  roses; and so the prince my brother has come to prove his own valour, and  to say, that if any or all of your guests, whether baptised or infidel,  choose to meet him in the joust, he will encounter them one by one, in  the green meadow without the walls, near the place called the Horseblock  of Merlin, by the Fountain of the Pine. And his conditions are  these,--that no knight who chances to be thrown shall have license to  renew the combat in any way whatsoever, but remain a submissive prisoner  in his hands; he, on the other hand, if himself be thrown, agreeing to  take his departure out of the country with his giants, and to leave his  sister, for prize, in the hands of the conqueror.\"    Kneeling at the close of these words, the lady awaited the answer of  Charlemagne, and every body gazed on her with astonishment. Orlando  especially, more than all the rest, felt irresistibly drawn towards her,  so that his heart trembled, and he changed countenance. But he felt  ashamed at the same time; and casting his eyes down, he said to himself,  \"Ah, mad and unworthy Orlando! whither is thy soul being hurried? I am  drawn, and cannot say nay to what draws me. I reckoned the whole world as  nothing, and now I am conquered by a girl. I cannot get her sweet look  out of my heart. My soul seems to die within me, at the thought of being  without her. It is love that has seized me, and I feel that nothing will  set me free;--not strength, nor courage, nor my own wisdom, nor that of  any adviser. I see the better part, and cleave to the worse.\"[2]    Thus secretly in his heart did the frank and noble Orlando lament over  his new feelings; and no wonder; for every knight in the hall was  enamoured of the beautiful stranger, not excepting even old white-headed  Duke Namo. Charlemagne himself did not escape.    All stood for awhile in silence, lost in the delight of looking at  her. The fiery youth Ferragus was the first to exhibit symptoms in his  countenance of uncontrollable passion. He refrained with difficulty from  going up to the giants, and tearing her out of their keeping. Rinaldo  also turned as red as fire; while his cousin Malagigi the enchanter, who  had discovered that the stranger was not speaking truth, muttered softly,  as he looked at her, \"Exquisite false creature! I will play thee such a  trick for this, as will leave thee no cause to boast of thy visit.\"    Charlemagne, to detain her as long as possible before him, made a speech  in answer, in which he talked and looked, and looked and talked, till  there seemed no end of it. At length, however, the challenge was accepted  in all its forms; and the lady quitted the hall with her brother and the  giants.    She had not yet passed the gates, when Malagigi the enchanter consulted  his books; and that no means might be wanting to complete the  counteraction of what he suspected, he summoned to his aid three spirits  out of the lower regions. But how serious his look turned, how his very  soul within him was shaken, when he discovered that the most dreadful  disasters hung over Charles and his court, and that the sister of the  pretended Uberto was daughter of King Galafron of Cathay, a beauty  accomplished in every species of enchantment, and sent there by her  father on purpose to betray them all! Her brother's name was not Uberto,  but Argalia. Galafron had given him a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#4)"],[1,"terials, wanted for the tessellated  flooring of his tent. Habits such as these will easily account for his  travelling in a carriage rather than on horseback.    The courtesy and obliging disposition of Caesar were notorious; and both  were illustrated in some anecdotes which survived for generations in  Rome. Dining on one occasion, as an invited guest, at a table where the  servants had inadvertently, for salad-oil, furnished some sort of coarse  lamp-oil, Caesar would not allow the rest of the company to point out  the mistake to their host, for fear of shocking him too much by exposing  what might have been construed into inhospitality. At another time,  whilst halting at a little _cabaret_, when one of his retinue was  suddenly taken ill, Caesar resigned to his use the sole bed which the  house afforded. Incidents as trifling as these express the urbanity of  Caesar's nature; and hence one is the more surprised to find the  alienation of the Senate charged, in no trifling degree, upon a gross  and most culpable failure in point of courtesy. Caesar, it is alleged--  but might we presume to call upon antiquity for its authority?--  neglected to rise from his seat, on their approaching him with an  address of congratulation. It is said, and we can believe it, that he  gave deeper offence by this one defect in a matter of ceremonial  observance than by all his substantial attacks upon their privileges.  What we find it difficult to believe is not that result from that  offence--this is no more than we should all anticipate--not _that_, but  the possibility of the offence itself, from one so little arrogant as  Caesar, and so entirely a man of the world. He was told of the disgust  which he had given; and we are bound to believe his apology, in which he  charged it upon sickness, that would not at the moment allow him to  maintain a standing attitude. Certainly the whole tenor of his life was  not courteous only, but kind, and to his enemies merciful in a degree  which implied so much more magnanimity than men in general could  understand that by many it was put down to the account of weakness.    Weakness, however, there was none in Caius Caesar; and, that there might  be none, it was fortunate that conspiracy should have cut him off in the  full vigour of his faculties, in the very meridian of his glory, and on  the brink of completing a series of gigantic achievements. Amongst these  are numbered:--a digest of the entire body of laws, even then become  unwieldy and oppressive; the establishment of vast and comprehensive  public libraries, Greek as well as Latin; the chastisement of Dacia  (that needed a cow-hiding for insolence as much as Affghanistan from us  in 1840); the conquest of Parthia; and the cutting a ship canal through  the Isthmus of Corinth. The reformation of the Calendar he had already  accomplished. And of all his projects it may be said that they were  equally patriotic in their purpose and colossal in their proportions.    As an orator, Caesar's merit was so eminent that, according to the  general belief, had he found time to cultivate this department of civil  exertion, the received supremacy of Cicero would have been made  questionable, or the honour would have been divided. Cicero himself was  of that opinion, and on different occasions applied the epithet  _splendidus_ to Caesar, as though in some exclusive sense, or with some  peculiar emphasis, due to him. His taste was much simpler, chaster, and  less inclined to the _florid_ and Asiatic, than that of Cicero. So far  he would, in that condition of the Roman culture and feeling, have been  less acceptable to the public; but, on the other hand, he would have  compensated this disadvantage by much more of natural and Demosthenic  fervour.    In literature, the merits of Caesar are familiar to most readers. Under  the modest title of _Commentaries_, he meant to offer the records of his  Gallic and British campaigns, simply as notes, or memoranda, afterwards  to be worked up by regular historians; but, as Cicero observes, their  merit was such in the eyes of the discerning that all judicious writers  shrank from the attempt to alter them. In another instance of his  literary labours he showed a very just sense of true dignity. Rightly  conceiving that everything patriotic was dignified, and that to  illustrate or polish his native language was a service of real and  paramount patriotism, he composed a work on the grammar and orthoepy of  the Latin language. Cicero and himself were the only Romans of  distinction in that age who applied themselves with true patriotism to  the task of purifying and ennobling their mother tongue. Both were aware  of a transcendent value in the Grecian literature as it then stood; but  that splendour did not depress their hopes of raising their own to  something of the same level. As respected the natural wealth of the two  languages, it was the private opinion of Cicero that the Latin had the  advantage; and, if Caesar did not accompany him to that length--which,  perhaps, under some limitations he ought to have done--he yet felt that  it was but the more necessary to draw forth any special or exceptional  advantage which it really had.    Was Caesar, upon the whole, the greatest of men? We restrict the  question, of course, to the classes of men great in _action_: great by  the extent of their influence over their social contemporaries; great by  throwing open avenues to extended powers that previously had been  closed; great by making obstacles once vast to become trivial, or prizes  that once were trivial to be glorified by expansion. I (said Augustus  Caesar) found Rome built of brick; but I left it built of marble. Well,  my man, we reply, for a wondrously little chap, you did what in  Westmoreland they call a good _darroch_ (day's work); and, if _navvies_  had been wanted in those days, you should have had our vote to a  certainty. But Caius Julius, even under such a limitation of the  comparison, did a thing as much transcending this as it was greater to  project Rome across the Alps and the Pyrenees,--expanding the grand  Republic into crowning provinces of 1. France (_Gallia_), 2. Belgium, 3.  Holland (_Batavia_), 4. England (_Britannia_), 5. Savoy (_Allobroges_),  6. Switzerland (_Helvetia_), 7. Spain (_Hispania_),--than to decorate a  street or to found an amphitheatre. Dr. Beattie once observed that, if  that question as to the greatest man in action upon the rolls of History  were left to be collected from the suffrages already expressed in books  and scattered throughout the literature of all nations, the scale would  be found to have turned prodigiously in Caesar's favour as against any  single competitor; and there is no doubt whatsoever that even amongst  his own countrymen, and his own contemporaries, the same verdict would  have been returned, had it been collected upon the famous principle of  Themistocles, that he should be reputed the first whom the greatest  number of rival voices had pronounced to be the second.

All these differ from each other  in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls  from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the  Belgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are  farthest from the civilisation and refinement of [our] Province, and  merchants least frequently resort to them and import those things which  tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans,  who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war;  for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in  valour, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when  they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage  war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that  the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone: it is bounded  by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae: it  borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the  river Rhine, and stretches towards the north. The Belgae rise from the  extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine;  and look towards the north and the rising sun.
