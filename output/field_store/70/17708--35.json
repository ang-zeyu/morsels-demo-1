Even the enormous balloon, almost  beaten to the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of  ballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was  held by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five  prisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived, and such was the  darkness that they could not even see each other.    Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their  places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer's order detached  successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only,  and the sailor rejoined his companions.    The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had  nothing to do but to give the word.    At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top,  a favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his  chain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional  weight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.    \"One more will make but little difference, poor beast!\" exclaimed  Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the  cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after  having dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it  swept by them.    Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the  voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending,  and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by  fog.    Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the  wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest  fury by the gale.    Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals  who set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of  March. Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast,  seven thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was  missing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the  engineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet,  they all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.        Chapter 3    The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried  off by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal  had voluntarily leaped out to help his master. \"Forward,\" cried the  reporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting  their fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving  way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on  earth.    Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared  to the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes  therefore of arriving in time to save him. \"Let us look for him! let us  look for him!\" cried Neb.    \"Yes, Neb,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"and we will find him too!\"    \"Living, I trust!\"    \"Still living!\"    \"Can he swim?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Yes,\" replied Neb, \"and besides, Top is there.\"    The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.    The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half  a mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point  of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.    It was then nearly six o'clock. A thick fog made the night very dark.  The castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had  thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they  could not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with  stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground,  very unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes,  making walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute  great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more  active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor  thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose  above the roaring of the sea.    From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for  some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had  landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the  barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to  give any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose  above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little  band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of  the shore.    After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly  brought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to  their feet. The solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the  extremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously.    \"It is a promontory,\" said the sailor; \"we must retrace our steps,  holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.\"    \"But if he is there,\" said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone  of a snowy white in the darkness. \"Well, let us call again,\" and all  uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no  reply. They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.    The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the  promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft  observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he  declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive  front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the  mist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea  was also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the  waves was diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This  side of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the  sharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow  this direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the  coast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a  half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to  the north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must  be attached to the mainland. The castaways, although their strength  was nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every  moment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first  direction. What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly  two miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks,  they found themselves again stopped by the sea.    \"We are on an islet,\" said Pencroft, \"and we have surveyed it from one  extremity to the other.\"    The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not  even on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in  length, with even a less breadth.    Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with  stones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important  archipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car  saw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter  it sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes  to piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly  distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated  coast. But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single  island, or connected with others. They could not leave it either, as the  sea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their  search for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached  them to show that he was still in existence.    \"The silence of our friend proves nothing,\" said the reporter. \"Perhaps  he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will  not despair.\"    The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet,  which would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain  for wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found.  The grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to  the intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too  evident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what  patience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to  save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast,  or he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold  was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived  it. They did not even think of taking a minute's rest. Forgetting  everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued  to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its  northern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the  catastrophe. They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices,  they endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would  be transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to  a calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb's  shouts even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft's  attention to it, adding, \"That proves that there is a coast to the west,  at no great distance.\" The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not  deceive him. If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might  appear, land was sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only  response produced by Neb's shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the  part east of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#4)"],[1,"same errand,  and bearing uncouth tin cans supplied by the institution. An  individualistic instinct of cleanliness made Esther prefer the family  pitcher. To-day this liberty of choice has been taken away, and the  regulation can, numbered and stamped, serves as a soup-ticket. There was  quite a crowd of applicants outside the stable-like doors of the kitchen  when Esther arrived, a few with well-lined stomachs, perhaps, but the  majority famished and shivering. The feminine element swamped the rest,  but there were about a dozen men and a few children among the group,  most of the men scarce taller than the children--strange, stunted,  swarthy, hairy creatures, with muddy complexions illumined by black,  twinkling eyes. A few were of imposing stature, wearing coarse, dusty  felt hats or peaked caps, with shaggy beards or faded scarfs around  their throats. Here and there, too, was a woman of comely face and  figure, but for the most part it was a collection of crones, prematurely  aged, with weird, wan, old-world features, slip-shod and draggle-tailed,  their heads bare, or covered with dingy shawls in lieu of bonnets--red  shawls, gray shawls, brick-dust shawls, mud-colored shawls. Yet there  was an indefinable touch of romance and pathos about the tawdriness and  witch-like ugliness, and an underlying identity about the crowd of  Polish, Russian, German, Dutch Jewesses, mutually apathetic, and  pressing forwards. Some of them had infants at their bare breasts, who  drowsed quietly with intervals of ululation. The women devoid of shawls  had nothing around their necks to protect them from the cold, the dusky  throats were exposed, and sometimes even the first hooks and eyes of the  bodice were unnecessarily undone. The majority wore cheap earrings and  black wigs with preternaturally polished hair; where there was no wig,  the hair was touzled.    At half-past five the stable-doors were thrown open, and the crowd  pressed through a long, narrow white-washed stone corridor into a  barn-like compartment, with a white-washed ceiling traversed by wooden  beams. Within this compartment, and leaving but a narrow, circumscribing  border, was a sort of cattle-pen, into which the paupers crushed,  awaiting amid discomfort and universal jabber the divine moment. The  single jet of gas-light depending from the ceiling flared upon the  strange simian faces, and touched them into a grotesque picturesqueness  that would have delighted Dore.    They felt hungry, these picturesque people; their near and dear ones  were hungering at home. Voluptuously savoring in imagination the  operation of the soup, they forgot its operation as a dole in aid of  wages; were unconscious of the grave economical possibilities of  pauperization and the rest, and quite willing to swallow their  independence with the soup. Even Esther, who had read much, and was  sensitive, accepted unquestioningly the theory of the universe that was  held by most people about her, that human beings were distinguished from  animals in having to toil terribly for a meagre crust, but that their  lot was lightened by the existence of a small and semi-divine class  called _Takeefim_, or rich people, who gave away what they didn't want.  How these rich people came to be, Esther did not inquire; they were as  much a part of the constitution of things as clouds and horses. The  semi-celestial variety was rarely to be met with. It lived far away from  the Ghetto, and a small family of it was said to occupy a whole house.  Representatives of it, clad in rustling silks or impressive broad-cloth,  and radiating an indefinable aroma of superhumanity, sometimes came to  the school, preceded by the beaming Head Mistress; and then all the  little girls rose and curtseyed, and the best of them, passing as  average members of the class, astonished the semi-divine persons by  their intimate acquaintance with the topography of the Pyrenees and the  disagreements of Saul and David, the intercourse of the two species  ending in effusive smiles and general satisfaction. But the dullest of  the girls was alive to the comedy, and had a good-humored contempt for  the unworldliness of the semi-divine persons who spoke to them as if  they were not going to recommence squabbling, and pulling one another's  hair, and copying one another's sums, and stealing one another's  needles, the moment the semi-celestial backs were turned.    To-night, semi-divine persons were to be seen in a galaxy of splendor,  for in the reserved standing-places, behind the white deal counter, was  gathered a group of philanthropists. The room was an odd-shaped polygon,  partially lined with eight boilers, whose great wooden lids were raised  by pulleys and balanced by red-painted iron balls. In the corner stood  the cooking-engine. Cooks in white caps and blouses stirred the steaming  soup with long wooden paddles. A tradesman besought the attention of the  Jewish reporters to the improved boiler he had manufactured, and the  superintendent adjured the newspaper men not to omit his name; while  amid the soberly-clad clergymen flitted, like gorgeous humming-birds  through a flock of crows, the marriageable daughters of an east-end  minister.    When a sufficient number of semi-divinities was gathered together, the  President addressed the meeting at considerable length, striving to  impress upon the clergymen and other philanthropists present that  charity was a virtue, and appealing to the Bible, the Koran, and even  the Vedas, for confirmation of his proposition. Early in his speech the  sliding door that separated the cattle-pen from the kitchen proper had  to be closed, because the jostling crowd jabbered so much and  inconsiderate infants squalled, and there did not seem to be any general  desire to hear the President's ethical views. They were a low material  lot, who thought only of their bellies, and did but chatter the louder  when the speech was shut out. They had overflowed their barriers by this  time, and were surging cruelly to and fro, and Esther had to keep her  elbows close to her sides lest her arms should be dislocated. Outside  the stable doors a shifting array of boys and girls hovered hungrily and  curiously. When the President had finished, the Rabbinate was invited to  address the philanthropists, which it did at not less length, eloquently  seconding the proposition that charity was a virtue. Then the door was  slid back, and the first two paupers were admitted, the rest of the  crowd being courageously kept at bay by the superintendent. The head  cook filled a couple of plates with soup, dipping a great pewter pot  into the cauldron. The Rabbinate then uplifted its eyes heavenwards, and  said the grace:    \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, King of the Universe, according to whose  word all things exist.\"    It then tasted a spoonful of the soup, as did also the President and  several of the visitors, the passage of the fluid along the palate  invariably evoking approving ecstatic smiles; and indeed, there was more  body in it this opening night than there would be later, when, in due  course, the bulk of the meat would take its legitimate place among the  pickings of office. The sight of the delighted deglutition of the  semi-divine persons made Esther's mouth water as she struggled for  breathing space on the outskirts of Paradise. The impatience which  fretted her was almost allayed by visions of stout-hearted Solomon and  gentle Rachel and whimpering little Sarah and Ikey, all gulping down  the delicious draught. Even the more stoical father and grandmother were  a little in her thoughts. The Ansells had eaten nothing but a slice of  dry bread each in the morning. Here before her, in the land of Goshen,  flowing with soup, was piled up a heap of halves of loaves, while  endless other loaves were ranged along the shelves as for a giant's  table. Esther looked ravenously at the four-square tower built of edible  bricks, shivering as the biting air sought out her back through a sudden  interstice in the heaving mass. The draught reminded her more keenly of  her little ones huddled together in the fireless garret at home. Ah!  what a happy night was in store. She must not let them devour the two  loaves to-night; that would be criminal extravagance. No, one would  suffice for the banquet, the other must be carefully put by. \"To-morrow  is also a day,\" as the old grandmother used to say in her quaint jargon.  But the banquet was not to be spread as fast as Esther's fancy could  fly; the doors must be shut again, other semi-divine and wholly divine  persons (in white ties) must move and second (with eloquence and length)  votes of thanks to the President, the Rabbinate, and all other available  recipients; a French visitor must express his admiration of English  charity. But at last the turn of the gnawing stomachs came. The motley  crowd, still babbling, made a slow, forward movement, squeezing  painfully through the narrow aperture, and shivering a plate glass  window pane at the side of the cattle-pen in the crush; the semi-divine  persons rubbed their hands and smiled genially; ingenious paupers tried  to dodge round to the cauldrons by the semi-divine entrance; the  tropical humming-birds fluttered among the crows; there was a splashing  of ladles and a gurgling of cascades of soup into the cans, and a hubbub  of voices; a toothless, white-haired, blear-eyed hag lamented in  excellent English that soup was refused her, owing to her case not  having yet been investigated, and her tears moistened the one loaf she  received. In like hard case a Russian threw himself on the stones and  howled. But at last Esther was running through the mist, warmed by the  pitcher which she hugged to her bosom, and suppressing the blind impulse  to pinch the pair of loaves tied up in her pinafore. She almost flew up  the dark flight of stairs to the attic in Royal Street. Little Sarah was  sobbing"]]]
