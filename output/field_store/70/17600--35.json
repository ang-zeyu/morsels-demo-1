The numerous  florets, which constitute the disk of the flowers in this class, contain  in each five males surrounding one female, which are connected at top,  whence the name of the class. An Italian writer, in a discourse on the  irritability of flowers, asserts, that if the top of the floret be  touched, all the filaments which support the cylindrical anther will  contrast themselves, and that by thus raising or depressing the anther  the whole of the prolific dust is collected on the stigma. He adds, that  if one filament be touched after it is separated from the floret, that it  will contract like the muscular fibres of animal bodies, his experiments  were tried on the Centaurea Calcitrapoides, and on artichokes, and  globe-thistles.

The flowers which  contain the five females, and those which contain the ten males, are  found on different plants; and often at a great distance from each other.  Five of the ten males arrive at their maturity some days before the other  five, as may be seen by opening the corol before it naturally expands  itself. When the females arrive at their maturity, they rise above the  petals, as if looking abroad for their distant husbands; the scarlet ones  contribute much to the beauty of our meadows in May and June.]              Proud GLORIOSA led _three_ chosen swains,  120  The blushing captives of her virgin chains.--          --When Time's rude hand a bark of wrinkles spread          Round her weak limbs, and silver'd o'er her head,          _Three_ other youths her riper years engage,          The flatter'd victims of her wily age.    125  So, in her wane of beauty, NINON won          With fatal smiles her gay unconscious son.--      [_Gloriosa_. l. 119. Superba. Six males, one female. The petals of this  beautiful flower with three of the stamens, which are first mature, stand  up in apparent disorder; and the pistil bends at nearly a right angle  to insert its stigma amongst them. In a few days, as these decline,  the other three stamens bend over, and approach the pistil. In the  Fritillaria Persica, the six stamens are of equal lengths, and the  anthers lie at a distance from the pistil, and three alternate ones  approach first; and, when these decline, the other three approach: in the  Lithrum Salicaria, (which has twelve males and one female) a beautiful  red flower, which grows on the banks of rivers, six of the males arrive  at maturity, and surround the female some time before the other six; when  these decline, the other six rise up, and supply their places. Several  other flowers have in similar manner two sets of stamens of different  ages, as Adoxa, Lychnis, Saxifraga. See Genista. Perhaps a difference  in the time of their maturity obtains in all these flowers, which have  numerous stamens. In the Kahnia the ten stamens lie round the pistil like  the radii of a wheel; and each anther is concealed in a nich of the corol  to protect it from cold and moisture; these anthers rise separately from  their niches, and approach the pistil for a time, and then recede to  their former situations.]    [Illustration: Gloriosa Superba]              Clasp'd in his arms she own'd a mother's name,--          \"Desist, rash youth! restrain your impious flame,          \"First on that bed your infant-form was press'd,  130  \"Born by my throes, and nurtured at my breast.\"--          Back as from death he sprung, with wild amaze          Fierce on the fair he fix'd his ardent gaze;          Dropp'd on one knee, his frantic arms outspread,          And stole a guilty glance toward the bed;  135  Then breath'd from quivering lips a whisper'd vow,          And bent on heaven his pale repentant brow;          \"Thus, thus!\" he cried, and plung'd the furious dart,          And life and love gush'd mingled from his heart.            The fell SILENE and her sisters fair,  140  Skill'd in destruction, spread the viscous snare.      [_Silene_. l. 139. Catchfly. Three females and ten males inhabit each  flower; the viscous material, which surrounds the stalks under the  flowers of this plant, and of the Cucubulus Otites, is a curious  contrivance to prevent various insects from plundering the honey, or  devouring the seed. In the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more  wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects: The leaves  are armed with long teeth, like the antennae of insects, and lie spread  upon the ground round the stem; and are so irritable, that when an  insect creeps upon them, they fold up, and crush or pierce it to death.  The last professor Linneus, in his Supplementum Plantarum, gives the  following account of the Arum Muscivorum. The flower has the smell of  carrion; by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber  of the flower, but in vain endeavour to escape, being prevented by the  hairs pointing inwards; and thus perish in the flower, whence its name  of fly-eater. P. 411. in the Dypsacus is another contrivance for this  purpose, a bason of water is placed round each joint of the stem. In  the Drosera is another kind of fly-trap. See Dypsacus and Drosera;  the flowers of Silene and Cucubalus are closed all day, but are open  and give an agreeable odour in the night. See Cerea.

When heaven's high vault condensing clouds deform,          Fair AMARYLLIS flies the incumbent storm,      [_Amaryllis_, l. 152. Formosissima. Most beautiful Amaryllis. Six males,  one female. Some of the bell-flowers close their apertures at night, or  in rainy or cold weather, as the convolvulus, and thus protect their  included stamens and pistils. Other bell-flowers hang their apertures  downwards, as many of the lilies; in those the pistil, when at maturity,  is longer than the stamens; and by this pendant attitude of the bell,  when the anthers burst, their dust falls on the stigma: and these are at  the same time sheltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews. But, as  a free exposure to the air is necessary for their fecundation, the style  and filaments in many of these flowers continue to grow longer after the  bell is open, and hang down below its rim. In others, as in the martagon,  the bell is deeply divided, and the divisions are reflected upwards, that  they may not prevent the access of air, and at the same time afford  some shelter from perpendicular rain or dew. Other bell-flowers, as the  hemerocallis and amaryllis, have their bells nodding only, as it were, or  hanging obliquely toward the horizon; which, as their stems are slender,  turn like a weathercock from the wind; and thus very effectually preserve  their inclosed stamens and anthers from the rain and cold. Many of these  flowers, both before and after their season of fecundation, erect their  heads perpendicular to the horizon, like the Meadia, which cannot be  explained from meer mechanism.    The Amaryllis formosissima is a flower of the last mentioned kind, and  affords an agreeable example of _art_ in the vegetable economy, 1. The  pistil is of great length compared with the stamens; and this I suppose  to have been the most unchangeable part of the flower, as in Meadia,  which see. 2. To counteract this circumstance, the pistil and stamens are  made to decline downwards, that the prolific dust might fall from the  anthers on the stigma. 3. To produce this effect, and to secure it when  produced, the corol is lacerated, contrary to what occurs in other  flowers of this genus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],[0,"Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#4)"],[1,". A plumule.    _Pea_. The same as the Bean.    They have also learned how the first leaves in the last three differ from  those of the Morning-Glory, being considerably thicker in the Sunflower,  and very much thicker in the Bean and Pea. Why should the Morning-Glory  have this jelly that the others have not? Why do the first leaves of the  Sunflower change so much as the seedling grows? What becomes of their  substance? Why do those of the Bean shrivel and finally drop off? By this  time some bright pupil will have discovered that the baby-plant needs food  and that this is stored around it in the Morning-Glory, and in the leaves  themselves in the others. It is nourished upon this prepared food, until  it has roots and leaves and can make its own living. The food of the  Morning-Glory is called _albumen_; it does not differ from the others in  kind, but only in its manner of storage.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. III. Seed-Food.]    Also the questions have brought out the fact that the Bean and Pea  have the plumule ready formed in the seed, while the Morning-Glory and  Sunflower have not. Why should this be? It is because there is so much  food stored in the first two that the plumule can develop before a root is  formed, while in the others there is only nourishment sufficient to enable  the plantlet to form its roots. These must make the second leaves by their  own labor.      3. _Comparison with other Dicotyledons_.--The pupils should now have other  seeds to compare with these four. Let them arrange Flax, Four o-clock,  Horsechestnut, Almond, Nasturtium, Maple-seeds, etc., under two heads.    _Seeds with the Food stored               _Seeds with the Food stored  outside the plantlet                      in the embryo itself  (Albuminous)_.                            (Exalbuminous)_.    Flax. Four-o'clock.                       Acorn. Horsechestnut. Almond.  Morning-Glory.                            Maple. Sunflower. Squash.                                            Bean. Pea. Nasturtium.    They may also be divided into those with and without the plumule.    _Without Plumule_.                        _With Plumule_.    Flax. Maple. Sunflower.                   Acorn. Horsechestnut.  Four-o'clock.                             Almond. Bean. Pea.  Morning-Glory.                            Squash. Nasturtium.    Those with plumules will be seen to have the most abundant nourishment. In  many cases this is made use of by man.    These last can be again divided into those in which the cotyledons come up  into the air and those where they remain in the ground.    _In the Air_.                             _In the Ground_.    Bean. Almond. Squash.                     Acorn. Horsechestnut.                                            Pea. Nasturtium.    In the latter the cotyledons are so heavily gorged with nourishment that  they never become of any use as leaves. As Darwin points out, they have  a better chance of escaping destruction by animals by remaining in the  ground.    The cotyledons are very good illustrations of the different uses to which  a single organ may be put, and the thorough understanding of it will  prepare the pupils' minds for other metamorphoses, and for the theory that  all the various parts of a plant are modified forms of a very few members.      4. _Nature of the Caulicle_.--Probably some of the pupils will have called  the caulicle the root. It is, however, of the nature of stem. The root  grows only at the end, from a point just behind the tip; the stem  elongates throughout its whole length. This can be shown by marking the  stem and roots of a young seedling with ink. India ink must be used, as  common ink injures the plants. Dip a needle in the ink and prick a row  of spots at equal distances on a young root. Corn is very good for this  purpose, but Morning-Glory or Bean is better for experiments on the  stem. The plants should then be carefully watched and the changes in  the relative distance of the spots noted. The experiment is very easily  conducted with the seedlings growing on sponge, with their roots in the  moist air of the tumbler, as before described.    Dr. Goodale says of this experiment,--\"Let a young seedling of corn be  grown on damp paper in the manner described in No. 1,[1] and when the  longest root is a few centimetres long let it be marked very carefully by  means of India ink, or purple ink, put on with a delicate camel's-hair  pencil just one centimetre apart. Plants thus marked are to be kept under  favorable conditions with respect to moisture and warmth, so that growth  will be as rapid as possible. The marks on the older part of the root  will not change their relative distance, but the mark at the tip will be  carried away from the one next it, showing that the growth has taken place  only at this point. Such experiments as the one described are perfectly  practicable for all classes of pupils except the very youngest. How far  the details of these experiments should be suggested to the pupils, or  rather how far they should be left to work out the problem for themselves,  is a question to be settled by the teacher in each case. The better plan  generally is to bring the problem in a very clear form before the whole  class, or before the whole school, and ask whether anybody can think of a  way in which it can be solved; for instance, in this case how can it be  found out whether roots grow only at their tip or throughout their whole  length. If the way is thought out by even a single pupil the rest will be  interested in seeing whether the plan will work successfully.\"    [Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 25.]    I have been more successful in pricking the roots than in marking them  with a brush.    The caulicle can be proved by the manner of its growth to be of the nature  of stem, not root. The main root grows from its naked end. Roots can also  grow from the sides of the caulicle, as in Indian Corn. In this, it acts  precisely as does the stem of a cutting. It can be prettily shown with the  seedlings by breaking off a bean at the ground and putting the slip in  water. It will throw out roots and the pupil will readily understand that  the caulicle does the same thing.    Darwin has made very interesting experiments on the movements of  seedlings. If the teacher wishes to repeat some of the experiments he will  find the details very fully given in \"The Power of Movement of Plants.\"[1]  The pupils can observe in their growing seedlings some of the points  mentioned and have already noticed a few in their answers. They have said  that the caulicle was the part to grow first, and have spoken of the  arched form of the young stem. Their attention should also be drawn to the  root-hairs, which are well seen in Corn, Wheat, and Oats. They absorb the  liquid food of the plants. A secondary office is to hold the seed firmly,  so that the caulicle can enter the ground. This is shown in Red Clover,  which may be sown on the surface of the ground. It puts out root-hairs,  which attach themselves to the particles of sand and hold the seed. These  hairs are treated more fully in the lessons on roots.    [Footnote 1: The Power of Movement in Plants. By Charles Darwin. London.  John Murray, 1880.]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. IV. Movements of Seedlings.]      5. _Leaves of Seedlings_.--Coming now to the question as to the number of  leaves at each joint of the stem, the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, and Bean  will present no difficulty, but probably all the pupils will be puzzled by  the Pea. The stipules, so large and leaf-like, look like two leaves,  with a stem between, bearing other opposite leaves, and terminating in a  tendril, while in the upper part it could not be told by a beginner which  was the continuation of the main stem. For these reasons I left this out  in the questions on the Pea, but it should be taken up in the class. How  are we to tell what constitutes a single leaf? The answer to this question  is that buds come in the _axils_ of single leaves; that is, in the inner  angle which the leaf makes with the stem. If no bud can be seen in the  Pea, the experiment may be tried of cutting off the top of the seedling  plant. Buds will be developed in the axils of the nearest leaves, and it  will be shown that each is a compound leaf with two appendages at its  base, called stipules, and with a tendril at its apex. Buds can be forced  in the same way to grow from the axils of the lower scales, and even from  those of the cotyledons, and the lesson may be again impressed that organs  are capable of undergoing great modifications. The teacher may use his own  judgment as to whether he will tell them that the tendril is a modified  leaflet.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. 1. Grain of Indian Corn. 2. Vertical section,  dividing the embryo, _a_, caulicle: _b_, cotyledon; _c_, plumule. 3.  Vertical section, at right angles to the last.]      6. _Monocotyledons_.--These are more difficult. Perhaps it is not worth  while to attempt to make the pupils see the embryo in Wheat and Oats. But  the embryo of Indian Corn is larger and can be easily examined after long  soaking. Removing the seed-covering, we find the greater part of the seed  to be albumen. Closely applied to one side of this, so closely that it  is difficult to separate it perfectly, is the single cotyledon. This  completely surrounds the plumule and furnishes it with food from the  albumen. There is a line down the middle, and, if we carefully bend back  the edges of the cotyledon, it splits along this line, showing the  plumule and caulicle within. The plumule consists of successive layers of  rudimentary leaves, the outer enclosing the rest (Fig. 10, 1, _c_). The  latter is the first leaf and remains undeveloped as a scaly sheath (Fig.  10, 2, _c_). In Wheat and Oats the cotyledon can be easily seen in the  largest seedlings by pulling off the dry husk of the grain. The food "]]]
