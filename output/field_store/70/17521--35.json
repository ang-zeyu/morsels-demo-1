That  claim is for no partial sway, no exclusive possession. He cannot be  satisfied with any one gift of life, any one department of knowledge  or telescopic peep at the heavens. He feels himself called to  understand and aid Nature, that she may, through his intelligence, be  raised and interpreted; to be a student of, and servant to, the  universe-spirit; and king of his planet, that, as an angelic minister  he may bring it into conscious harmony with the law of that spirit.    In clear, triumphant moments, many times, has rung through the spheres  the prophecy of his jubilee; and those moments, though past in time,  have been translated into eternity by thought; the bright signs they  left hang in the heavens, as single stars or constellations, and,  already, a thickly sown radiance consoles the wanderer in the darkest  night. Other heroes since Hercules have fulfilled the zodiac of  beneficent labors, and then given up their mortal part to the fire  without a murmur; while no God dared deny that they should have their  reward,          Siquis tamen, Hercule, siquis    Forte Deo doliturus erit, daia praemia nollet,    Sed meruise dari sciet, invitus que probabit,        Assensere Dei      Sages and lawgivers have bent their whole nature to the search for  truth, and thought themselves happy if they could buy, with the  sacrifice of all temporal ease and pleasure, one seed for the future  Eden. Poets and priests have strung the lyre with the heart-strings,  poured out their best blood upon the altar, which, reared anew from  age to age, shall at last sustain the flame pure enough to rise to  highest heaven. Shall we not name with as deep a benediction those  who, if not so immediately, or so consciously, in connection with the  eternal truth, yet, led and fashioned by a divine instinct, serve no  less to develop and interpret the open secret of love passing into  life, energy creating for the purpose of happiness; the artist whose  hand, drawn by a preexistent harmony to a certain medium, moulds it  to forms of life more highly and completely organized than are seen  elsewhere, and, by carrying out the intention of nature, reveals her  meaning to those who are not yet wise enough to divine it; the  philosopher who listens steadily for laws and causes, and from those  obvious infers those yet unknown; the historian who, in faith that all  events must have their reason and their aim, records them, and thus  fills archives from which the youth of prophets may be fed; the man of  science dissecting the statements, testing the facts and demonstrating  order, even where he cannot its purpose?    Lives, too, which bear none of these names, have yielded tones of no  less significance. The candlestick set in a low place has given light  as faithfully, where it was needed, as that upon the hill, In close  alleys, in dismal nooks, the Word has been read as distinctly, as when  shown by angels to holy men in the dark prison. Those who till a spot  of earth scarcely larger than is wanted for a grave, have deserved  that the sun should shine upon its sod till violets answer.    So great has been, from time to time, the promise, that, in all ages,  men have said the gods themselves came down to dwell with them; that  the All-Creating wandered on the earth to taste, in a limited nature,  the sweetness of virtue; that the All-Sustaining incarnated himself to  guard, in space and time, the destinies of this world; that heavenly  genius dwelt among the shepherds, to sing to them and teach them how  to sing. Indeed,      \"Der stets den Hirten gnadig sich bewies.\"      \"He has constantly shown himself favorable to shepherds.\"    And the dwellers in green pastures and natural students of the stars  were selected to hail, first among men, the holy child, whose life and  death were to present the type of excellence, which has sustained the  heart of so large a portion of mankind in these later generations.    Such marks have been made by the footsteps of _man_ (still, alas!  to be spoken of as the _ideal_ man), wherever he has passed  through the wilderness of _men_, and whenever the pigmies stepped  in one of those, they felt dilate within the breast somewhat that  promised nobler stature and purer blood. They were impelled to forsake  their evil ways of decrepit scepticism and covetousness of corruptible  possessions. Convictions flowed in upon them. They, too, raised the  cry: God is living, now, to-day; and all beings are brothers, for they  are his children. Simple words enough, yet which only angelic natures  can use or hear in their full, free sense.    These were the triumphant moments; but soon the lower nature took its  turn, and the era of a truly human life was postponed.    Thus is man still a stranger to his inheritance, still a pleader,  still a pilgrim. Yet his happiness is secure in the end. And now, no  more a glimmering consciousness, but assurance begins to be felt and  spoken, that the highest ideal Man can form of his own powers is that  which he is destined to attain. Whatever the soul knows how to seek,  it cannot fail to obtain. This is the Law and the Prophets. Knock and  it shall be opened; seek and ye shall find. It is demonstrated; it is  a maxim. Man no longer paints his proper nature in some form, and  says, \"Prometheus had it; it is God-like;\" but \"Man must have it; it  is human.\" However disputed by many, however ignorantly used, or  falsified by those who do receive it, the fact of an universal,  unceasing revelation has been too clearly stated in words to be lost  sight of in thought; and sermons preached from the text, \"Be ye  perfect,\" are the only sermons of a pervasive and deep-searching  influence.    But, among those who meditate upon this text, there is a great  difference of view as to the way in which perfection shall be sought.    \"Through the intellect,\" say some. \"Gather from every growth of life  its seed of thought; look behind every symbol for its law; if thou  canst _see_ clearly, the rest will follow.\"    \"Through the life,\" say others. \"Do the best thou knowest today.  Shrink not from frequent error in this gradual, fragmentary state.  Follow thy light for as much as it will show thee; be faithful as far  as thou canst, in hope that faith presently will lead to sight. Help  others, without blaming their need of thy help. Love much, and be  forgiven.\"    \"It needs not intellect, needs not experience,\" says a third. \"If you  took the true way, your destiny would be accomplished, in a purer and  more natural order. You would not learn through facts of thought or  action, but express through them the certainties of wisdom. In  quietness yield thy soul to the causal soul. Do not disturb thy  apprenticeship by premature effort; neither check the tide of  instruction by methods of thy own. Be still; seek not, but wait in  obedience. Thy commission will be given.\"    Could we indeed say what we want, could we give a description of the  child that is lost, he would be found. As soon as the soul can affirm  clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at hand. When  the Jewish prophet described the Lamb, as the expression of what was  required by the coming era, the time drew nigh. But we say not, see  not as yet, clearly, what we would. Those who call for a more  triumphant expression of love, a love that cannot be crucified, show  not a perfect sense of what has already been given. Love has already  been expressed, that made all things new, that gave the worm its place  and ministry as well as the eagle; a love to which it was alike to  descend into the depths of hell, or to sit at the right hand of the  Father.    Yet, no doubt, a new manifestation is at hand, a new hour in the day  of Man. We cannot expect to see any one sample of completed being,  when the mass of men still lie engaged in the sod, or use the freedom  of their limbs only with wolfish energy. The tree cannot come to  flower till its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole  growth open to air and light. While any one is base, none can be  entirely free and noble. Yet something new shall presently be shown of  the life of man, for hearts crave, if minds do not know how to ask it.    Among the strains of prophecy, the following, by an earnest mind of a  foreign land, written some thirty years ago, is not yet outgrown; and  it has the merit of being a positive appeal from the heart, instead of  a critical declaration what Man should _not_ do.    \"The ministry of Man implies that he must be filled from the divine  fountains which are being engendered through all eternity, so that, at  the mere name of his master, he may be able to cast all his enemies  into the abyss; that he may deliver all parts of nature from the  barriers that imprison them; that he may purge the terrestrial  atmosphere from the poisons that infect it; that he may preserve the  bodies of men from the corrupt influences that surround, and the  maladies that afflict them; still more, that he may keep their souls  pure from the malignant insinuations which pollute, and the gloomy  images that obscure them; that he may restore its serenity to the  Word, which false words of men fill with mourning and sadness; that he  may satisfy the desires of the angels, who await from him the  development of the marvels of nature; that, in fine, his world may be  filled with God, as eternity is.\" [Footnote: St. Martin]    Another attempt we will give, by an obscure observer of our own day  and country, to draw some lines of the desired image. It was suggested  by seeing the design of Crawford's Orpheus, and connecting with the  circumstance of the American, in his garret at Rome, making choice of  this subject, that of Americans here at home showing such ambition to  represent the character, by calling their prose and verse \"Orphic  sayings\"--\"Orphics.\" We wish we could add"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#3)"],[1,"tangle  of other voices most like the muttered song through a City telephone in  the busiest part of the day.    He talked of the galley--his own galley had he but known it--with  illustrations borrowed from the \"Bride of Abydos.\" He pointed the  experiences of his hero with quotations from \"The Corsair,\" and threw in  deep and desperate moral reflections from \"Cain\" and \"Manfred,\" expecting  me to use them all. Only when the talk turned on Longfellow were the  jarring cross-currents dumb, and I knew that Charlie was speaking the  truth as he remembered it.    \"What do you think of this?\" I said one evening, as soon as I understood  the medium in which his memory worked best, and, before he could  expostulate, read him the whole of \"The Saga of King Olaf!\"    He listened open-mouthed, flushed, his hands drumming on the back of the  sofa where he lay, till I came to the Song of Einar Tamberskelver and the  verse:      \"Einar then, the arrow taking       From the loosened string,     Answered: 'That was Norway breaking       'Neath thy hand, O King.'\"    He gasped with pure delight of sound.    \"That's better than Byron, a little,\" I ventured.    \"Better? Why it's _true!_ How could he have known?\"    I went back and repeated:      \"What was that?' said Olaf, standing       On the quarter-deck,     'Something heard I like the stranding       Of a shattered wreck?'\"    \"How could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and go  _z-zzp_ all along the line? Why only the other night.... But go back  please and read 'The Skerry of Shrieks' again.\"    \"No, I'm tired. Let's talk. What happened the other night?\"    \"I had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours. I dreamed I was  drowned in a fight. You see we ran alongside another ship in harbor. The  water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up. You know where I  always sit in the galley?\" He spoke haltingly at first, under a fine  English fear of being laughed at,    \"No. That's news to me,\" I answered, meekly, my heart beginning to beat.    \"On the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck. There  were four of us at that oar, all chained. I remember watching the water  and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began. Then we closed up  on the other ship, and all their fighting men jumped over our bulwarks,  and my bench broke and I was pinned down with the three other fellows on  top of me, and the big oar jammed across our backs.\"    \"Well?\" Charlie's eyes were alive and alight. He was looking at the wall  behind my chair.    \"I don't know how we fought. The men were trampling all over my back, and  I lay low. Then our rowers on the left side--tied to their oars, you  know--began to yell and back water. I could hear the water sizzle, and we  spun round like a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, that there was  a galley coming up bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could just lift  up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to meet her bow  to bow, but it was too late. We could only turn a little bit because the  galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving.  Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our left oars began to break as the other  galley, the moving one y'know, stuck her nose into them. Then the  lower-deck oars shot up through the deck planking, butt first, and one of  them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head.\"    \"How was that managed?\"    \"The moving galley's bow was plunking them back through their own  oar-holes, and I could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below. Then  her nose caught us nearly in the middle, and we tilted sideways, and the  fellows in the right-hand galley unhitched their hooks and ropes, and  threw things on to our upper deck--arrows, and hot pitch or something that  stung, and we went up and up and up on the left side, and the right side  dipped, and I twisted my head round and saw the water stand still as it  topped the right bulwarks, and then it curled over and crashed down on the  whole lot of us on the right side, and I felt it hit my back, and I woke.\"    \"One minute, Charlie. When the sea topped the bulwarks, what did it look  like?\" I had my reasons for asking. A man of my acquaintance had once gone  down with a leaking ship in a still sea, and had seen the water-level  pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck.    \"It looked just like a banjo-string drawn tight, and it seemed to stay  there for years,\" said Charlie.    Exactly! The other man had said: \"It looked like a silver wire laid down  along the bulwarks, and I thought it was never going to break.\" He had  paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of  knowledge, and I had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and  take his knowledge at second hand. But Charlie, the bank-clerk on  twenty-five shillings a week, he who had never been out of sight of a  London omnibus, knew it all. It was no consolation to me that once in his  lives he had been forced to die for his gains. I also must have died  scores of times, but behind me, because I could have used my knowledge,  the doors were shut.    \"And then?\" I said, trying to put away the devil of envy.    \"The funny thing was, though, in all the mess I didn't feel a bit  astonished or frightened. It seemed as if I'd been in a good many fights,  because I told my next man so when the row began. But that cad of an  overseer on my deck wouldn't unloose our chains and give us a chance. He  always said that we'd all be set free after a battle, but we never were;  we never were.\" Charlie shook his head mournfully.    \"What a scoundrel!\"    \"I should say he was. He never gave us enough to eat, and sometimes we  were so thirsty that we used to drink salt-water. I can taste that  salt-water still.\"    \"Now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought.\"    \"I didn't dream about that. I know it was a harbor, though; because we  were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone under  water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped when the  tide made us rock.\"    \"That's curious. Our hero commanded the galley, didn't he?\"    \"Didn't he just! He stood by the bows and shouted like a good 'un. He was  the man who killed the overseer.\"    \"But you were all drowned together, Charlie, weren't you?\"    \"I can't make that fit quite,\" he said, with a puzzled look. \"The galley  must have gone down with all hands, and yet I fancy that the hero went on  living afterward. Perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship. I wouldn't  see that, of course. I was dead, you know.\" He shivered slightly and  protested that he could remember no more.    I did not press him further, but to satisfy myself that he lay in  ignorance of the workings of his own mind, deliberately introduced him to  Mortimer Collins's \"Transmigration,\" and gave him a sketch of the plot  before he opened the pages.    \"What rot it all is!\" he said, frankly, at the end of an hour. \"I don't  understand his nonsense about the Red Planet Mars and the King, and the  rest of it. Chuck me the Longfellow again.\"    I handed him the book and wrote out as much as I could remember of his  description of the sea-fight, appealing to him from time to time for  confirmation of fact or detail. He would answer without raising his eyes  from the book, as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before him on  the printed page. I spoke under the normal key of my voice that the  current might not be broken, and I know that he was not aware of what he  was saying, for his thoughts were out on the sea with Longfellow.    \"Charlie,\" I asked, \"when the rowers on the gallies mutinied how did they  kill their overseers?\"    \"Tore up the benches and brained 'em. That happened when a heavy sea was  running. An overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and  fell among the rowers. They choked him to death against the side of the  ship with their chained hands quite quietly, and it was too dark for the  other overseer to see what had happened. When he asked, he was pulled down  too and choked, and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck, with  the pieces of the broken benches banging behind 'em. How they howled!\"    \"And what happened after that?\"    \"I don't know. The hero went away--red hair and red beard and all. That  was after he had captured our galley, I think.\"    The sound of my voice irritated him, and he motioned slightly with his  left hand as a man does when interruption jars.    \"You never told me he was red-headed before, or that he captured your  galley,\" I said, after a discreet interval.    Charlie did not raise his eyes.    \"He was as red as a red bear,\" said he, abstractedly. \"He came from the  north; they said so in the galley when he looked for rowers--not slaves,  but free men. Afterward--years and years afterward--news came from another  ship, or else he came back\"--    His lips moved in silence. He was rapturously retasting some poem before  him.    \"Where had he been, then?\" I was almost whispering that the sentence might  come gentle to whichever section of Charlie's brain was working on my  behalf.    \"To the Beaches--the Long and Wonderful Beaches!\" was the reply, after a  minute of silence.    \"To Furdurstrandi?\" I asked, tingling from head to foot.    \"Yes, to Furdurstrandi,\" he pronounced the word in a new fashion. \"And I  too saw\"----The voice failed.    \"Do you know what you have said?\" I shouted, incautiously.    He lifted his eyes, fully roused now, \"No!\" he snapped. \"I wish you'd let  a chap go on reading. Hark to this:      \"'But Othere, the old sea captain,     He neither paused nor stirred       Till the king listened, and then       Once more took up his pen     And wrote down every word,      \"'And to the King of the Saxons     In witness of the truth,       Raising his noble head,       He stretched his brown hand and said,     "]]]
