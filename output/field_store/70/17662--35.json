The hair on the  spine (and dorsal region) ought not to be touched with any instrument  whatever; the hand alone should be used to rub and smooth it, and in the  direction of its natural growth, so as to preserve from injury that part  of the horse's back on which the rider sits.    The head should be drenched with water simply; for, being bony, if you  try to cleanse it with iron or wooden instruments injury may be caused.  So, too, the forelock should be merely wetted; the long hairs of which  it is composed, without hindering the animal's vision, serve to scare  away from the eyes anything that might trouble them. Providence, we must  suppose, (6) bestowed these hairs upon the horse, instead of the large  ears which are given to the ass and the mule as a protection to the  eyes. (7) The tail, again, and mane should be washed, the object being  to help the hairs to grow--those in the tail so as to allow the creature  the greatest reach possible in brushing away molesting objects, (8) and  those of the neck in order that the rider may have as free a grip as  possible.     (6) Lit. \"The gods, we must suppose, gave...\"     (7) Lit. \"as defences or protective bulwarks.\"     (8) Insects, etc.    Mane, forelock, and tail are triple gifts bestowed by the gods upon the  horse for the sake of pride and ornament, (9) and here is the proof: a  brood mare, so long as her mane is long and flowing, will not readily  suffer herself to be covered by an ass; hence breeders of mules take  care to clip the mane of the mare with a view to covering. (10)     (9) {aglaias eneka} (a poetic word). Cf. \"Od.\" xv. 78; xvii. 310.     (10) For this belief Schneid. cf Aristot. \"H. A.\" vi. 18; Plin. viii.      42; Aelian, \"H. A.\" ii. 10, xi. 18, xii. 16, to which Dr. Morgan      aptly adds Soph. \"Fr.\" 587 (Tyro), a beautiful passage, {komes de      penthos lagkhano polou diken, k.t.l.} (cf. Plut. \"Mor.\" 754 A).    Washing of the legs we are inclined to dispense with--no good is done  but rather harm to the hoofs by this daily washing. So, too, excessive  cleanliness of the belly is to be discouraged; the operation itself is  most annoying to the horse; and the cleaner these parts are made, the  thicker the swarm of troublesome things which collect beneath the belly.  Besides which, however elaborately you clean these parts, the horse is  no sooner led out than presently he will be just as dirty as if he had  not been cleaned. Omit these ablutions then, we say; and similarly for  the legs, rubbing and currying by hand is quite sufficient.        VI    We will now explain how the operation of grooming may be performed with  least danger to oneself and best advantage to the horse. If the groom  attempts to clean the horse with his face turned the same way as the  horse, he runs the risk of getting a knock in the face from the animal's  knee or hoof. When cleaning him he should turn his face in the opposite  direction to the horse, and planting himself well out of the way of his  leg, at an angle to his shoulder-blade, proceed to rub him down. He  will then escape all mischief, and he will be able to clean the frog by  folding back the hoof. Let him clean the hind-legs in the same way.    The man who has to do with the horse should know, with regard to this  and all other necessary operations, that he ought to approach as little  as possible from the head or the tail to perform them; for if the horse  attempt to show vice he is master of the man in front and rear. But by  approaching from the side he will get the greatest hold over the horse  with the least risk of injury to himself.    When the horse has to be led, we do not approve of leading him from in  front, for the simple reason that the person so leading him robs himself  of his power of self-protection, whilst he leaves the horse freedom to  do what he likes. On the other hand, we take a like exception to the  plan of training the horse to go forward on a long rein (1) and lead  the way, and for this reason: it gives the horse the opportunity of  mischief, in whichever direction he likes, on either flank, and the  power also to turn right about and face his driver. How can a troop  of horses be kept free of one another, if driven in this fashion from  behind?--whereas a horse accustomed to be led from the side will have  least power of mischief to horse or man, and at the same time be in the  best position to be mounted by the rider at a moment's notice, were it  necessary.     (1) See a passage from Strattis, \"Chrys.\" 2 (Pollux, x. 55), {prosage      ton polon atrema, proslabon ton agogea brakhuteron. oukh oras oti      abolos estin}.    In order to insert the bit correctly the groom should, in the first  place, approach on the near (2) side of the horse, and then throwing  the reins over his head, let them drop loosely on the withers; raise the  headstall in his right hand, and with his left present the bit. If the  horse will take the bit, it is a simple business to adjust the strap of  the headstall; but if he refuses to open his mouth, the groom must hold  the bit against the teeth and at the same time insert the thumb (3)  of his left hand inside the horse's jaws. Most horses will open their  mouths to that operation. But if he still refuses, then the groom must  press the lip against the tush (4); very few horses will refuse the bit,  when that is done to them. (5)     (2) Lit. \"on the left-hand side.\"     (3) {ton megan daktulon}, Hdt. iii. 8.     (4) i.e. \"canine tooth.\"     (5) Or, \"it is a very exceptional horse that will not open his mouth      under the circumstances.\"    The groom can hardly be too much alive to the following points * * * if  any work is to be done: (6) in fact, so important is it that the horse  should readily take his bit, that, to put it tersely, a horse that will  not take it is good for nothing. Now, if the horse be bitted not only  when he has work to do, but also when he is being taken to his food and  when he is being led home from a ride, it would be no great marvel if he  learnt to take the bit of his own accord, when first presented to him.     (6) Reading with L. Dind. {khre de ton ippokomon kai ta oiade...      paroxunthai, ei ti dei ponein}, or if as Schneid., Sauppe, etc.,      {khre de ton ippon me kata toiade, k.t.l.}, transl. \"the horse      must not be irritated in such operations as these,\" etc.; but      {toiade} = \"as follows,\" if correct, suggests a lacuna in either      case at this point.    It would be good for the groom to know how to give a leg up in the  Persian fashion, (7) so that in case of illness or infirmity of age  the master himself may have a man to help him on to horseback without  trouble, or, if he so wish, be able to oblige a friend with a man to  mount him. (8)     (7) Cf. \"Anab.\" IV. iv. 4; \"Hipparch,\" i. 17; \"Cyrop.\" VII. i. 38.     (8) An {anaboleus}. Cf. Plut. \"C. Gracch.\" 7.    The one best precept--the golden rule--in dealing with a horse is never  to approach him angrily. Anger is so devoid of forethought that it will  often drive a man to do things which in a calmer mood he will regret.  (9) Thus, when a horse is shy of any object and refuses to approach it,  you must teach him that there is nothing to be alarmed at, particularly  if he be a plucky animal; (10) or, failing that, touch the formidable  object yourself, and then gently lead the horse up to it. The opposite  plan of forcing the frightened creature by blows only intensifies its  fear, the horse mentally associating the pain he suffers at such a  moment with the object of suspicion, which he naturally regards as its  cause.     (9) Cf. \"Hell.\" v. iii. 7 for this maxim.     (10) Al. \"if possibly by help of another and plucky animal.\"    If, when the groom brings up the horse to his master to mount, he knows  how to make him lower his back, (11) to facilitate mounting, we have no  fault to find. Still, we consider that the horseman should practise and  be able to mount, even if the horse does not so lend himself; (12) since  on another occasion another type of horse may fall to the rider's lot,  (13) nor can the same rider be always served by the same equerry.

VII    The master, let us suppose, has received his horse and is ready to  mount. (1) We will now prescribe certain rules to be observed in the  interests not only of the horseman but of the animal which he bestrides.  First, then, he should take the leading rein, which hangs from the  chin-strap or nose-band, (2) conveniently in his left hand, held slack  so as not to jerk the horse's mouth, whether he means to mount by  hoisting himself up, catching hold of the mane behind the ears, or  to vault on to horseback by help of his spear. With the right hand  he should grip the reins along with a tuft of hair beside the  shoulder-joint, (3) so that he may not in any way wrench the horse's  mouth with the bit while mounting. In the act of taking the spring off  the ground for mounting, (4) he should hoist his body by help of the  left hand, and with the right at full stretch assist the upward movement  (5) (a position in mounting which will present a graceful spectacle also  from behind); (6) at the same time with the leg well bent, and taking  care not to place his knee on the horse's back, he must pass his leg  clean over to the off side;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11772"],[0,"Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816 (#4)"],[1,"through the barriers which religion attempts to oppose to  it: this depravity of morals must therefore be attributed to inflamed  passions, and not to abuses facilitated by a religion so sublime as ours.    The Island of Teneriffe is not equal to that of Madeira: one cannot even  compare their agricultural productions, on account of the great difference  of their soils: but in a commercial view, Teneriffe has the advantage of  Madeira. Its geographical position in the middle of the Canaries, enables  it to carry on an extensive trade, while Madeira is confined to the sale  and exchange of its wines for articles of European manufacture.    The soil of Teneriffe is much drier; a great part of it is too volcanic to  be used for agriculture: every part of it however, which is capable of  producing anything is very well cultivated, which should seem to prove,  that the Spaniards of this country are naturally much less indolent than  they have been represented.[A3]    When we were in the open sea we had favorable winds from the N.N.E.    In the night of the 29th of June the frigate caught fire between decks, by  the negligence of the master baker; but being discovered in time, the fire  was extinguished. In the following night the same accident was repeated;  but this time it was necessary, in order to stop the progress of the fire,  to pull down the oven which was rebuilt the next day.    On the 1st of July we descried Cape Bayados, situated in latitude 26 deg. 12'  30\", and in longitude 16 deg. 47'. We then saw the skirts of the immense desert  of Zaara, and we thought we perceived the mouth of the river St. John [A4],  which is very little known. We passed the tropic at ten o'clock in the  morning; the usual ceremony was there performed with a certain pomp; the  jokes of the sailors amused us for some moments; we were far from thinking  of the cruel event which was soon to deprive of their lives a third of the  persons who were on board the frigate. This custom of tropical baptism is  strange enough; the chief object of it, is, to procure the sailors some  money.    From St. Croix, we had constantly steered to the S.S.W. During the ceremony  at the tropic we doubled Cape Barbas, situated in lat. 22 deg. 6', and long.  19 deg. 8': two officers suddenly had the course changed, without informing the  captain; this led to a pretty warm dispute, which however had no serious  consequences. These two officers affirmed that we were running upon a group  of rocks, and that we were already very near to the breakers. We had sailed  the whole morning in the Gulph of St. Cyprian, the bottom of which is  strewed with rocks, so that at low water, brigantines cannot frequent these  seas, as we were told at Senegal by M. Valentin, senior, who is perfectly  acquainted with this whole coast, and could not conceive how the frigate  could have passed amidst all these reefs without striking. The shore was  within half a cannon shot, and we clearly saw enormous rocks over which the  sea broke violently.[11] If it had fallen calm, there is no doubt but the  strong currents which set, in-shore, would have infallibly carried us into  danger.    In the evening we thought we descried Cape Blanco[A5], and according to  the instructions given by the Navy Office, we steered W.S.W. During a part  of the night the _Echo_, with which we had constantly kept company since we  left Madeira, burnt several charges of powder and hung a lanthorn at the  mizen-mast; her signals were not answered in the same manner; only a  lanthorn was hung for a few moments to the fore-mast; it went out soon  after, and was not replaced by another light. M. Savigny was on deck where  he remained a part of the night: he had full opportunity to perceive the  negligence of the officer of the watch, who did not even deign to answer  the signals made by the _Echo_[A6]. Why, in the neighbourhood of so  formidable a danger, not compare the points of the two ships, as is usual  when vessels sail in company?  The captain of the frigate was not even  informed of the signals of the corvette. At eleven o'clock, she bore off  the larboard bow; and soon after he perceived that the direction of her  course made a pretty large angle with ours, and that it tended to cross us  passing a-head; he soon perceived her on the starboard: it is affirmed that  her journal states that she sailed the whole night W.S.W. ours does the  same. We must necessarily have hauled to the larboard, or she to the  starboard, since at day-break the corvette was no longer in sight.    At sea a vessel may easily be perceived at the distance of six leagues.  From midnight till six in the morning, she must have gained above six  leagues of us, which is not to be imagined, for she sailed much slower than  we and stopped every two hours to take soundings. To explain this  separation we must necessarily admit either that the frigate steered more  south, or the corvette more west, if the two vessels had run on the same  tack it would be impossible to explain it.    Every two hours the frigate brought-to, to sound; every half hour the lead  was cast without lowering the sails; we were always upon shallows, and  stood out to sea, to find a greater quantity of water: at length about six  o'clock in the morning we had above a hundred fathoms; we then stood-to the  S.S.E.; this course made almost a right angle with that which we had  followed in the night: it bore directly in-shore, the approach to which, in  this place, is rendered terrible by a very long reef, called Arguin, which  according to instructions we had on board extends above thirty leagues in  breadth.[12] According to the instructions given by the Minister of the  Marine, this danger is avoided by running only twenty-two leagues in the  open sea; it is true they recommend not to approach the shore but with the  greatest precaution, and with the sounding line in the hand: the other  ships of the expedition which sailed according to those instructions all  arrived at St. Louis without any accident, which is a certain proof of  their exactness.[13] Besides it is said, that one must make W.S.W., when  one has discerned Cape Blanco; and it is probable we had not got sight of  it in the evening, as was supposed. We therefore had an uncertain point of  departure; hence the error which was so fatal to us.    According to my Comrade Correard, we cannot pass over in silence, a scene  which took place in the morning. The Captain was deceived in the most  singular manner; about five or six o'clock he was called up; some persons  who were on deck persuaded him that a great cloud which was in the  direction of Cape Blanco and in truth very near it, was that Cape itself.  My companion in misfortune, who sees clearly, and who knows how to  distinguish between a rock and a cloud, because he has seen enough of them  in the Alps, where he was born, told those gentlemen that it was only a  cape of vapour; he was answered that the instructions which the minister  had given to the captain prescribed to him to make this cape; but that we  had passed it above ten leagues; that at this moment the question was, to  make the captain believe that the instructions of the minister had been  punctually followed, and that they desired to persuade him, which was not  difficult, that this cloud was the Cape. Many have deposed, as we have been  told, that Cape Blanco, had been seen in the evening of the 1st of July: we  venture to affirm that that rock was not seen at all.    After this pretended reconnaissance of the 2d July, if we were persuaded  that we had seen that Cape, we should have steered west, to double the bank  of Arguin; the danger once passed, the course should have been again  directed to the south which is the route to Senegal; but he who for some  days past had guided the course of the ship, thought proper to persuade the  captain, to take immediately the southerly course, and to steer for  Portendic. We are ignorant of the reasons which induced the commander of  the frigate to give his confidence to a man who did not belong to the  staff. He was an ex-officer of the marine, who had just left an English  prison, where he had been for ten years; he certainly had not acquired  there knowledge superior to that of the officers on board, whom this mark  of deference could not but offend. M. de Chaumareys, while we were doubling  Cape Barbas, presided at the farce performed in passing the Tropic, while  he who had gained his confidence, was walking up and down the deck of the  frigate, coolly observing the numerous dangers, spread along the coast.  Several persons remonstrated against this management of the vessel,  particularly Mr. Picard the greffier of Senegal, who had struck upon the  bank of Arguin eight years before; this enlightened man declared at that  time that we were running into danger.    As soon as the sun's altitude was observed to ascertain our position, we  saw, on the quarter deck, Mr. Maudet, ensign of the watch, working the  day's work, (making out the reckoning) upon a chicken coop; this officer  who knows all the duties of his profession, affirmed that we were on the  edge of the reef; he communicated this to the person who for some days past  had given his counsel to the commander respecting the course to be steered;  he received for answer; never mind, we are in eighty fathoms.[14]    If our course during the night had partly averted all our dangers, that  which was taken in the morning led us into them again. Mr. Maudet,  convinced that we were upon the reef, took upon him, to have soundings  taken; the colour of the water was intirely changed, which was observed  even by those who were the least used to recognise the depth of the sea, by  the appearance of the water; we even thought that we saw sand roll amid the  little waves that rose; numerous sea weeds were seen by the ship's side,  and a great many fish were caught. All these facts proved"]]]
