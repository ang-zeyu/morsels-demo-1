I reckon by that they got some of  the goat.    \"They lived like we live now. Every family done his own cooking. I don't  know how many families lived on the place.    \"I know about the Yankees. They come by and every one of the men and  boys went with them but Uncle Cal. He was cripple and they advised him  not to start. Didn't none of the women go. Mama said she never seen but  one ever come back. She thought they got killed or went on some place  else.    \"Mr. Keller died and Miss Ada went back to her folks. They left  everything in our care that they didn't move. She took all her house  things. They sold or took all their stock. They left us a few cows and  pigs. I don't know how long they stayed after the old man died. His  children was young; he might not been so old.    \"I recollect grandma. She smoked a pipe nearly all the time. My papa was  a livery stable man. He was a fine man with stock. He was a little black  man. Mama was too big. Grandma was taller but she was slick black. He  lived at Mobile, Alabama. I was the onliest child mama had. Uncle 'Tate  Keller' took grandma and mama to Mobile. He never went to the War. He  was a good carpenter and he worked out when he didn't have a lot to do  in the field. He was off at work when all the black men and boys left  Mr. Bill. He never went back after they left till freedom.    \"They didn't know when freedom took place. They was all scattering for  two years about to get work and something to eat. Tate come and got  them. They went off in a wagon that Tate made for his master, Bill  Keller. We come to Tupelo, Mississippi from Mobile when I was a little  bit of a girl. Then we made one crop and come to Helena. Uncle Tate died  there and mama died at Crocketts Bluff. My papa died back in Mobile,  Alabama. He was breaking a young horse and got throwed up side a tree.  He didn't live long then.    \"I got three boys now and I had seben--all boys. They farms and do  public work. Tom is in Memphis. Pete is in Helena and I live wid Macon  between here (Wheatley) and Cotton Plant. We farm. I done everything  could be thought of on a farm. I ploughed some less than five year ago.  I liked to plough. My boy ploughs all he can now and we do the chopping.  We all pick cotton and get in the corn. We work day laborers now.    \"If I was young the times wouldn't stand in my way. I could make it. I  don't know what is the trouble lessen some wants too much. They can't  get it. We has a living and thankful for it. I never 'plied for no help  yet.    \"I still knits my winter stockings. I got knitting needles and cards my  own mother had and used. I got use for them. I wears clothes on my body  in cold weather. One reason you young folks ain't no 'count you don't  wear enough clothes when it is cold. I wear flannel clothes if I can get  holt of them.    \"Education done ruint the world.

Alexander                      2422 Center Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 74      [HW: Helps Build Railroad]    \"I was born in the country several miles from Charlotte in Macklenberg,  County, North Carolina in 1864.    \"My father's name was John Alexander and my mother was Esther McColley.  That was her maiden name of course.    \"My father's master was named Silas Alexander and my mother belonged to  Hugh Reed. I don't know just how she and my father happened to meet.  These two slaveholders were adjoining neighbors, you might say.    \"My father and my mother married during the war. I was the first child.  I had three half brothers and three half sisters from the father's side.  I didn't have no whole brothers and sisters. I am the only one on my  mother's side. My father was not in the war.    \"I don't know that the pateroles bothered him very much. My father and  mother were well treated by our master and then both she and my father  were quiet and their masters were good to them naturally.    \"During slavery times, my father was a farmer. My mother farmed too. She  was a hand in the field. They lived in a little log cabin, one room.  They had a bed in there, a few chairs and a homemade table. They had a  plank floor. I only know what I heard my people speak of. I don't know  what was what for myself because I was too young.    \"From what I can understand they had a big room at the house and the  slaves came there and ate there. They had a colored woman who prepared  their meals. The children mostly were raised on pot liquor. While the  old folk were working the larger young uns mongst the children would  take care of the little ones.    \"Their masters never forced any breeding. I have heard of that happening  in other places but I never heard them speak of it in connection with  our master.    \"When the master came back from the war, they told the slaves they were  free. After slavery my people stayed on and worked on the old  plantation. They didn't get much. Something like fifty cents a day and  one meal. My folks didn't work on shares.    \"Back there in North Carolina times got tight and it seemed that there  wasn't much doing. Agents came from Arkansas trying to get laborers. So  about seven or eight families of us emigrated from North Carolina. That  is how my folks got here.    \"The Ku Klux were bad in North Carolina too. My people didn't have any  trouble with them in Arkansas, though. They weren't bothered so much in  North Carolina because of their owners. But they would come around and  see them. They came at night. We came to Arkansas in the winter of 1897.    \"I went to public school after the war, in North Carolina. I didn't get  any further than the eighth grade. My father and mother didn't get any  schooling till after the war. They could read a little but they picked  it up themselves during slavery. I suppose their Master's children  learned it to them.    \"My father never did see any army service. I have heard him speak of  seeing soldiers come through though. They looted the place and took  everything they wanted and could carry.    \"When I first come to this state, I settled in Drew County and farmed. I  farmed for three years. During the time I was there, I got down sick  with slow fever. When I got over that I decided that I would move to  higher ground. There was a man down there who recommended Little Rock  and so I moved here. I have been here forty-nine years. That is quite a  few days.    \"I belong to the Presbyterian Church and have been a member of that  church for fifty-five years. I have never gotten out publicly, but I  even do my little preaching round in the house here.    \"When I came to Little Rock, I came in a very dull season. There wasn't  even a house to be rented. It was in the winter. I had to rent a room at  \"Jones\" hall on Ninth and Gaines streets and paid one dollar a day for  it. I stayed there about a month. Finally there was a vacant house over  on Nineteenth street and Common and I moved there. Then I commenced to  look for work and I walked the town over daily. No results whatever.  Finally I struck a little job with the contractor here digging ditches,  grubbing stumps, grading streets and so forth. I worked with him for  three years and finally I got a job with the street car company, as  laborer in the Parks. I worked at that job two years. Finally I got a  job as track laborer. I worked there a year. Then I was promoted to  track foreman. I held that seven years.    \"I quit that then and went to the railroads. I helped to build the  Choctaw Oklahoma and Gulf Railway. When the road was completed, I made  the first trip over it as Porter. I remained there till August 9, 1928.  During that time I was operated on for prostatitis and doctors rendered  me unfit for work, totally disabled; so that is my condition today.    \"I think the future looks bright. I think conditions will get better. I  believe that all that is necessary for betterment is cooperation.    \"I believe the younger generation--the way it looks--is pretty bad.

If we assume that God (who is mentioned in line 38) is Osiris,  it does not do away with the fact that he was regarded as a being  entirely different from the \"god of the city\" and that he was of  sufficient importance to have one line of the \"Confession\" devoted to  him. The Egyptian saw no incongruity in setting references to the \"gods\"  side by side with allusions to a god whom we cannot help identifying  with the Supreme Being and the Creator of the world; his ideas and  beliefs have, in consequence, been sadly misrepresented, and by certain  writers he has been made an object of ridicule. What, for example, could  be a more foolish description of Egyptian worship than the following?  \"Who knows not, O Volusius of Bithynia, the sort of monsters Egypt, in  her infatuation, worships. One part venerates the crocodile; another  trembles before an ibis gorged with serpents. The image of a sacred  monkey glitters in gold, where the magic chords sound from Memnon broken  in half, and ancient Thebes lies buried in ruins, with her hundred  gates. In one place they venerate sea-fish, in another river-fish;  there, whole towns worship a dog: no one Diana. It is an impious act to  violate or break with the teeth a leek or an onion. O holy nations!  whose gods grow for them in their gardens! Every table abstains from  animals that have wool: it is a crime there to kill a kid. But human  flesh is lawful food.\"    [Footnote: Juvenal, Satire XV. (Evans' translation in Bohn's Series, p.  180). Led astray by Juvenal, our own good George Herbert (_Church  Militant_) wrote:--      \"At first he (_i.e._, Sin) got to Egypt, and did sow    Gardens of gods, which every year did grow    Fresh and fine deities. They were at great cost,    Who for a god clearly a sallet lost.    Ah, what a thing is man devoid of grace,    Adoring garlic with an humble face,    Begging his food of that which he may eat,    Starving the while he worshippeth his meat!    Who makes a root his god, how low is he,    If God and man be severed infinitely!    What wretchedness can give him any room,    Whose house is foul, while he adores his broom?\"]    The epithets which the Egyptians applied to their gods also bear  valuable testimony concerning the ideas which they held about God. We  have already said that the \"gods\" are only forms, manifestations, and  phases of R[=a], the Sun-god, who was himself the type and symbol of  God, and it is evident from the nature of these epithets that they were  only applied to the \"gods\" because they represented some qualify or  attribute which they would have applied to God had it been their custom  to address Him. Let us take as examples the epithets which are applied  to H[=a]pi the god of the Nile. The beautiful hymn [Footnote: The whole  hymn has been published by Maspero in _Hymns au Nil_, Paris, 1868.] to  this god opens as follows:--      \"Homage to thee, O H[=a]pi! Thou comest forth in this land, and dost    come in peace to make Egypt to live, O thou hidden one, thou guide of    the darkness whensoever it is thy pleasure to be its guide. Thou    waterest the fields which R[=a] hath created, thou makest all animals    to live, thou makest the land to drink without ceasing; thou    descendest the path of heaven, thou art the friend of meat and drink,    thou art the giver of the grain, and thou makest every place of work    to flourish, O Ptah! ... If thou wert to be overcome in heaven the    gods would fall down headlong, and mankind would perish. Thou makest    the whole earth to be opened (_or_ ploughed up) by the cattle, and    prince and peasant lie down to rest.... His disposition (_or_ form) is    that of Khnemu; when he shineth upon the earth there is rejoicing, for    all people are glad, the mighty man (?) receiveth his meat, and every    tooth hath food to consume.\"    After praising him for what he does for mankind and beasts, and for  making the herb to grow for the use of all men, the text says:--      \"He cannot be figured in stone; he is not to be seen in the sculptured    images upon which men place the united crowns of the South and the    North furnished with uraei; neither works nor offerings can be made to    him; and he cannot be made to come forth from his secret place. The    place where he liveth is unknown; he is not to be found in inscribed    shrines; there existeth no habitation which can contain him; and thou    canst not conceive his form in thy heart.\"    First we notice that Hapi is addressed by the names of Ptah and Khnemu,  not because the writer thought these three gods were one, but because  Hapi as the great supplier of water to Egypt became, as it were, a  creative god like Ptah and Khnemu. Next we see that it is stated to be  impossible to depict him in paintings, or even to imagine what his form  may be, for he is unknown and his abode cannot be found, and no place  can contain him. But, as a matter of fact, several pictures and  sculptures of H[=a]pi have been preserved, and we know that he is  generally depicted in the form of two gods; one has upon his head a  papyrus plant, and the other a lotus plant, the former being the  Nile-god of the South, and the latter the Nile-god of the North.  Elsewhere he is portrayed in the form of a large man having the breasts  of a woman. It is quite clear, then, that the epithets which we have  quoted are applied to him merely as a form of God. In another hymn,  which was a favourite in the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties, H[=a]pi is  called \"One,\" and is said to have created himself; but as he is later on  in the text identified with R[=a] the epithets which belong to the  Sun-god are applied to him. The late Dr. H. Brugsch collected [Footnote:  _Religion and Mythologie_, pp. 96-99.] a number of the epithets which  are applied to the gods, from texts of all periods; and from these we  may see that the ideas and beliefs of the Egyptians concerning God were  almost identical with those of the Hebrews and Muhammadans at later  periods. When classified these epithets read thus:--      \"God is One and alone, and none other existeth with Him; God is the    One, the One Who hath made all things.      \"God is a spirit, a hidden spirit, the spirit of spirits, the great    spirit of the Egyptians, the divine spirit.      \"God is from the beginning, and He hath been from the beginning; He    hath existed from of old and was when nothing else had being. He    existed when nothing else existed, and what existeth He created after    He had come into being. He is the father of beginnings.      \"God is the eternal One, He is eternal and infinite; and endureth for    ever and aye; He hath endured for countless ages, and He shall endure    to all eternity.      \"God is the hidden Being, and no man hath known His form. No man hath    been able to seek out His likeness; He is hidden, from gods and men,    and He is a mystery unto His creatures.      \"No man knoweth how to know Him, His name remaineth hidden; His name    is a mystery unto His children. His names are innumerable, they are    manifold and none knoweth their number.      \"God is truth, and He liveth by truth, and he feedeth thereon. He is    the King of truth, He resteth upon truth, He fashioneth truth, and He    executeth truth throughout all the world.      \"God is life, and through Him only man liveth, He giveth life to man,    and He breatheth the breath of life into his nostrils.      \"God is father and mother, the father of fathers, and the mother of    mothers. He begetteth, but was never begotten; He produceth, but was    never produced He begat Himself and produced Himself. He createth, but    was never created; He is the maker of His own form, and the fashioner    of His own body.      \"God Himself is existence He liveth in all things, and liveth upon all    things. He endureth without increase or diminution, He multiplieth    Himself millions of times, and He possesseth multitudes of forms and    multitudes of members.      \"God hath made the universe, and He hath created all that therein is:    He is the Creator of what is in this world, of what was, of what is,    and of what shall be. He is the Creator of the world, and it was He    Who fashioned it with His hands before there was any beginning; and He    stablished it with that which went forth from Him. He is the Creator    of the heavens and the earth; the Creator of the heavens, and the    earth, and the deep; the Creator of the heavens, and the earth, and    the deep, and the waters, and the mountains. God hath stretched out    the heavens and founded the earth. What His heart conceived came to    pass straightway, and when He had spoken His word came to pass, and it    shall endure for ever.      \"God is the father of the gods, and the father of the father of all    deities; He made His voice to sound, and the deities came into being,    and the gods sprang into existence after He had spoken with His mouth.    He formed mankind and fashioned the gods. He is the great Master, the    primeval Potter Who turned men and gods out of His hands, and He    formed men and gods upon a potter's table.      \"The heavens rest upon His head, and the earth supporteth His feet;    heaven hideth His spirit, the earth hideth His form, and the    underworld shutteth up the mystery of Him within it. His body is like    the air, heaven resteth upon His head, and the new inundation [of the    Nile] containeth His form.      \"God is merciful unto those who reverence Him, and He heareth him that    calleth upon Him. He protecteth the weak against the strong, and He    heareth the cry of him that is bound in fetters; He judgeth between    the mighty and the weak, God knoweth him that knoweth Him, He    rewardeth him that serveth Him,"]]]
