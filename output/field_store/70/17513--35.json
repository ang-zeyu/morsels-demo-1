This made my first introduction to him. After that I had a long talk  over the whole matter at one of the _conversaziones_ of the Association,  and we became fast friends from thenceforward. However, he did not tell  me he was to be married in a week or so; but about a fortnight later I  was walking down from Chamounix to commence the tour of Mont Blanc, and  whom should I meet walking up but Joule, with a long thermometer in his  hand, and a carriage with a lady in it not far off. He told me he had  been married since we had parted at Oxford! and he was going to try for  elevation of temperature in waterfalls. We trysted to meet a few days  later at Martigny, and look at the Cascade de Sallanches, to see if it  might answer. We found it too much broken into spray. His young wife, as  long as she lived, took complete interest in his scientific work, and  both she and he showed me the greatest kindness during my visits to them  in Manchester for our experiments on the thermal effects of fluid in  motion, which we commenced a few years later\"    \"Joule's paper at the Oxford meeting made a great sensation. Faraday was  there and was much struck with it, but did not enter fully into the new  views. It was many years after that before any of the scientific chiefs  began to give their adhesion. It was not long after, when Stokes told me  he was inclined to be a Joulite.\"    \"Miller, or Graham, or both, were for years quite incredulous as to  Joule's results, because they all depended on fractions of a degree of  temperature--sometimes very small fractions. His boldness in making such  large conclusions from such very small observational effects is almost  as noteworthy and admirable as his skill in extorting accuracy from  them. I remember distinctly at the Royal Society, I think it was either  Graham or Miller, saying simply he did not believe Joule, because he had  nothing but hundredths of a degree to prove his case by.\"    The friendship formed between Joule and Thomson in 1847 grew rapidly.  A voluminous correspondence was kept up between them, and several  important researches were undertaken by the two friends in common. Their  first joint research was on the thermal effects experienced by air  rushing through small apertures The results of this investigation give  for the first time an experimental basis for the hypothesis assumed  without proof by Mayer as the foundation for an estimate of the  numerical relation between quantities of heat and mechanical work, and  they show that for permanent gases the hypothesis is very approximately  true. Subsequently, Joule and Thomson undertook more comprehensive  investigations on the thermal effects of fluids in motion, and on the  heat acquired by bodies moving rapidly through the air. They found the  heat generated by a body moving at one mile per second through the air  sufficient to account for its ignition. The phenomena of \"shooting  stars\" were explained by Mr. Joule in 1847 by the heat developed by  bodies rushing into our atmosphere.    It is impossible within the limits to which this sketch is necessarily  confined to speak in detail of the many researches undertaken by Mr.  Joule on various physical subjects. Even of the most interesting of  these a very brief notice must suffice for the present.    Molecular physics, as I have already remarked, early claimed his  attention. Various papers on electrolysis of liquids, and on the  constitution of gases, have been the result. A very interesting paper  on \"Heat and the Constitution of Elastic Fluids\" was read before  the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1848. In it he  developed Daniel Bernoulli's explanation of air pressure by the impact  of the molecules of the gas on the sides of the vessel which contains  it, and from very simple considerations he calculated the average  velocity of the particles requisite to produce ordinary atmospheric  pressure at different temperatures. The average velocity of the  particles of hydrogen at 32 deg. F. he found to be 6,055 feet per second,  the velocities at various temperatures being proportional to the square  roots of the numbers which express those temperatures on the absolute  thermodynamic scale.    His contribution to the theory of the velocity of sound in air was  likewise of great importance, and is distinguished alike for the  acuteness of his explanations of the existing causes of error in the  work of previous experimenters, and for the accuracy, so far as  was required for the purpose in hand, of his own experiments. His  determination of the specific heat of air, pressure constant, and the  specific heat of air, volume constant, furnished the data necessary for  making Laplace's theoretical velocity agree with the velocity of sound  experimentally determined. On the other hand, he was able to account  for most puzzling discrepancies, which appeared in attempted direct  determinations of the differences between the two specific heats by  careful experimenters. He pointed out that in experiments in which air  was allowed to rush violently or _explode_ into a vacuum, there was a  source of loss of energy that no one had taken account of, namely,  in the sound produced by the explosion. Hence in the most careful  experiments, where the vacuum was made as perfect as possible, and the  explosion correspondingly the more violent, the results were actually  the worst. With his explanations, the theory of the subject was rendered  quite complete.    Space fails, or I should mention in detail Mr. Joule's experiments on  magnetism and electro-magnets, referred to at the commencement of this  sketch. He discovered the now celebrated change of dimensions produced  by the magnetization of soft iron by the current. The peculiar noise  which accompanies the magnetization of an iron bar by the current,  sometimes called the \"magnetic tick,\" was thus explained.    Mr. Joule's improvements in galvanometers have already been incidentally  mentioned, and the construction by him of accurate thermometers has been  referred to. It should never be forgotten that _he first_ used small  enough needles in tangent galvanometers to practically annul error from  want of uniformity of the magnetic field. Of other improvements and  additions to philosophical instruments may be mentioned a thermometer,  unaffected by radiation, for measuring the temperature of the  atmosphere, an improved barometer, a mercurial vacuum pump, one of the  very first of the species which is now doing such valuable work, not  only in scientific laboratories, but in the manufacture of incandescent  electric lamps, and an apparatus for determining the earth's horizontal  magnetic force in absolute measure.    Here this imperfect sketch must close. My limits are already passed. Mr.  Joule has never been in any sense a public man; and, of those who know  his name as that of the discoverer who has given the experimental basis  for the grandest generalization in the whole of physical science, very  few have ever seen his face. Of his private character this is scarcely  the place to speak. Mr. Joule is still among us. May he long be spared  to work for that cause to which he has given his life with heart-whole  devotion that has never been excelled.    In June, 1878, he received a letter from the Earl of Beaconsfield  announcing to him that Her Majesty the Queen had been pleased to grant  him a pension of L200 per annum. This recognition of his labors by his  country was a subject of much gratification to Mr. Joule.    Mr. Joule received the Gold Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1852,  the Copley Gold Medal of the Royal Society in 1870, and the Albert Medal  of the Society of Arts from the hand of the Prince of Wales in 1880.    J. T. BOTTOMLEY.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW YORK CANALS.      The recent adoption of the constitutional amendment abolishing tolls on  the canals of New York State has revived interest in these water ways.  The overwhelming majority by which the measure was passed shows, says  the _Glassware Reporter_, that the people are willing to bear the cost  of their management by defraying from the public treasury all expenses  incident to their operation. That the abolition of the toll system will  be a great gain to the State seems to be admitted by nearly everybody,  and the measure met with but little opposition except from the railroad  corporations and their supporters.    At as early a date as the close of the Revolutionary War, Mr. Morris had  suggested the union of the great lakes with the Hudson River, and in  1812 he again advocated it. De Witt Clinton, of New York, one of the  most, valuable men of his day, took up the idea, and brought the leading  men of his State to lend him their support in pushing it. To dig a  canal all the way from Albany to Lake Erie was a pretty formidable  undertaking; the State of New York accordingly invited the Federal  government to assist in the enterprise.    The canal was as desirable on national grounds as on any other, but the  proposition met with a rebuff, and the Empire State then resolved to  build the canal herself. Surveyors were sent out to locate a line for  it, and on July 4, 1817, ground was broken for the canal by De Witt  Clinton, who was then Governor of the State.    The main line, from Albany, on the Hudson, to Buffalo, on Lake Erie,  measures 363 miles in length, and cost $7,143,789. The Champlain,  Oswego, Chemung, Cayuga, and Crooked Lake canals, and some others, join  the main line, and, including these branch lines, it measures 543 miles  in length, and cost upward of $11,500,000. This canal was originally 40  feet in breadth at the water line, 28 feet at the bottom, and 4 feet in  depth. Its dimensions proved too small for the extensive trade which it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8467"],[0,"Frost's Laws and By-Laws of American Society (#3)"],[1,"ation,  _and of that structure in the mind which renders it capable of the  most delicate sympathies_--one may say simply fineness of nature.  This is, of course, compatible with heroic bodily strength and  mental firmness; in fact, heroic strength is not conceivable  without such delicacy. Elephantine strength may drive its way  through a forest, and feel no touch of the boughs, but the white  skin of Homer's Atrides would have felt a bent rose leaf, yet  subdue its feelings in glow of battle, and behave itself like  iron. I do not mean to call an elephant a vulgar animal; but if  you think about him carefully, you will find that his non-  vulgarity consists in such gentleness as is possible to  elephantine nature; not in his insensitive hide, nor in his clumsy  foot, but in the way he will lift his foot if a child lies in his  way; and in his sensitive trunk, and still more sensitive mind,  and capability of pique on points of honor....    \"Hence it will follow, that one of the probable signs of high  breeding in men generally will be their kindness and mercifulness;  these always indicating more or less firmness of make in the  mind.\"    Undoubtedly the first law of good breeding is unselfishness, that  thorough forgetfulness of one's own wants and comforts, and  thoughtfulness for the happiness and ease of others, which is the  Christian gentleman's rule of life; which makes him yield the easy  chair to another older and weaker than himself, and sit upon a  narrow bench, or perhaps stand up; which selects for another the  choicest portions of the dishes upon the table, and uncomplainingly  dines off what is left; which hears with smiling interest the well-  worn anecdotes of the veteran story-teller; which gently lifts the  little child, who has fallen, and comforts the sobbing grief and  terror; which never forgets to endeavor to please others, and seems,  at least, pleased with all efforts made to entertain himself. Place  the code of politeness beside that of vulgarity and see if the one  does not contain all virtue, the other vice. Is not good temper  virtuous and polite, bad temper vicious and vulgar? Is not self  denial virtuous and polite, selfishness vicious and vulgar? Is not  truth virtuous and polite, scandal vicious and vulgar? Take every  principle in the conventional code of the perfectly well-bred, and  so define it, and not a virtue is rude.    True etiquette, as we have said before, is not politeness, yet it  is founded upon the same basis. An English author says:    \"Etiquette may be defined as the minor morality of life. No  observances, however minute, that tend to spare the feelings of  others, can be classed under the head of trivialities; and  politeness, which is but another name for general amiability,  will oil the creaking wheels of life more effectually than any of  those unguents supplied by mere wealth or station.\"    To be truly polite, one must be at once good, just and generous,  has been well said by a modern French writer:    \"True politeness is the outward visible sign of those inward  spiritual graces called modesty, unselfishness, generosity. The  manners of a gentleman are the index of his soul. His speech is  innocent, because his life is pure; his thoughts are direct,  because his actions are upright; his bearing is gentle, because  his blood, and his impulses, and his training are gentle also. A  true gentleman is entirely free from every kind of pretence. He  avoids homage, instead of exacting it. Mere ceremonies have no  attractions for him. He seeks not only to say civil things, but to  do them. His hospitality, though hearty and sincere, will be  strictly regulated by his means. His friends will he chosen for  their good qualities and good manners; his servants for their  thoughtfulness and honesty; his occupations for their usefulness,  or their gracefulness, or their elevating tendencies, whether  moral, or mental, or political. And so we come round again to our  first maxims, _i.e._, that 'good manners are the kindly fruit of a  refined nature.'    \"And if this be true of mankind, how still more true is it of  womankind! Granted that truthfulness, gracefulness, considerateness,  unselfishness, are essential to the breeding of a true gentleman,  how infinitely essential must they be to the breeding of a true  lady! That her tact should be even readier, her sympathies even  tenderer, her instinct even finer than those of the man, seems only  fit and natural. In her politeness, prevcyance, and all the minor  observances of etiquette, are absolutely indispensable. She must be  even more upon her guard than a man in all those niceties of speech,  look and manner, which are the especial and indispensable  credentials of good breeding. Every little drawing-room ceremonial,  all the laws of society, the whole etiquette of hospitality must be  familiar to her. And even in these points, artificial though they  be, her best guide after all, is that kindness of heart which gives  honor where honor is due, and which is ever anxious to spare the  feelings and prejudices of others.    \"Every mistress of a house, be it remembered, is a minor  sovereign, upon whose bounty the comfort, and happiness, and  refinement of her little court depends. She must take especial  care that her servants are capable, well trained and reliable, and  that her domestic arrangements are carried on as noiselessly and  easily as if by machinery. In a well ordered house the machinery  is always in order, and always works out of sight. No well-bred  woman talks of her servants, of her dinner arrangements, or the  affairs of her nursery. One feels these matters to be under her  _surveillance_, and that fact alone is a guarantee of their good  management. The amusements and comforts of her guests are provided  for without discussion or comment; and whatever goes wrong is  studiously withheld from the conversation of the drawing-room. And  let no lady, however young, however beautiful, however gifted, for  one moment imagine that the management of her house can be  neglected with impunity. If she is rich enough to provide an  efficient housekeeper, well and good; but, even so, the final  responsibility must still rest upon her, and her alone. No tastes,  no pleasures must stand in the way of this important duty; and  even if that duty should at first seem irksome, the fulfillment of  it is sure to bring its own reward.    \"The very atmosphere of the house proclaims the mistress. The  servants wear a cheerful air, and meet you with candid and  friendly faces; the rooms are tastefully furnished; an  irreproachable cleanliness and neatness reign around. The  unexpected guest finds an orderly table and an unembarrassed  welcome. In such a house, scandal finds no favor, and conversation  never degenerates into gossip. In such a home, peace and plenty  and goodwill are permanent household gods.\"    The most perfect law of politeness, the safest and surest guide in  all that pertains to the true definition of a gentleman or lady  is, after all, the Christian rule:    \"Do unto others as you would others should do unto you.\"     No one with this for a guide can ever fail in true, genuine  _politeness_, and that politeness will soon lead him to learn and  remember all the prevailing rules of established _etiquette_.      INTRODUCTIONS.    NEVER introduce people to each other unless you are sure the  acquaintance so commenced will be mutually agreeable.    A person who, from youth, social position or any other cause,  stands in the inferior position of the two persons to be  introduced to each other, must be introduced to the superior. A  gentleman is always to be introduced to a lady, never a lady to a  gentleman.    At a ball, it is the part of the host and hostess to make  introductions amongst the guests; but guests may with perfect  propriety introduce friends to each other. Gentlemen must never  introduce friends to ladies, without first obtaining special  permission to do so, and this permission should be always granted,  unless there is a very strong reason for the refusal. The French,  and in a great measure the English, dispense with introductions at  a private ball. It is taken for granted that the hostess has  invited to her ball only such people as are fit to be mutually  acquainted, and the fact that they have been invited to meet each  other is a sufficient warrant for self-introduction. This practice  saves a great deal of trouble, but it applies only to balls in  private houses. At any public ball, partners must be introduced to  each other; indeed it is better for ladies at such entertainments,  to dance only with the gentlemen of their own party, or with whom  they had a previous acquaintance. Special introductions may,  however, be made with propriety by the master of ceremonies.    When introducing two gentlemen, look first to the elder, or, if  there is any difference in social standing, to the superior, and  with a slight bow say to him: \"Allow me to introduce my friend,  Mr. Jones, to you;\" then turning to your friend, repeat his name,  and follow it by that of the gentleman to whom he is introduced,  thus: \"Mr. Smith, allow me to introduce my friend, Mr. Jones, to  you. Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith.\" In introducing a gentleman to a lady,  bow slightly to the latter, saying, \"Miss---, allow me to  introduce Mr.---; Mr.---, (bowing to him) Miss---.\"    When several persons are introduced to one, it is sufficient to  name the single individual once, repeating all the names of the  others, thus: \"Mr. Johnson, allow me to introduce Mr. and Mrs.  James, Miss Smithson, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Johnson,\" bowing slightly to  each when named.    Shaking hands after an introduction has taken place is merely  optional, not necessary; and is forbidden to an unmarried lady to  whom a gentleman is introduced. A bow is all that etiquette  requires. In introducing young persons to elder ones of good  social standing,"]]]
