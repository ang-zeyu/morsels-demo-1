I myself and my daughter Mary stayed to guard the  little children, because it was not safe there from wolves. We therefore  made a blazing fire, sat ourselves around it, and heard the little folks  say the Ten Commandments, when there was a rustling and crackling behind  us, and my daughter jumped up and ran into the cavern, crying, \"_Proh dolor  hostis_!\" But it was only some of the able-bodied men who had stayed behind  in the village, and who now came to bring us word how things stood there. I  therefore called to her directly, \"_Emergas amici_\" whereupon she came  skipping joyously out, and sat down again by the fire, and forthwith my  warden Hinrich Seden related all that had happened, and how his life had  only been saved by means of his wife Lizzie Kolken; but that Jurgen Flatow,  Chim Burse, Claus Peer, and Chim Seideritz were killed, and the last named  of them left lying on the church steps. The wicked incendiaries had burned  down twelve sheds, and it was not their fault that the whole village was  not destroyed, but only in consequence of the wind not being in the quarter  that suited their purpose. Meanwhile they tolled the bells in mockery and  scorn, to see whether any one would come and quench the fire; and that when  he and the three other young fellows came forward they fired off their  muskets at them, but, by God's help, none of them were hit. Hereupon his  three comrades jumped over the paling and escaped; but him they caught, and  had already taken aim at him with their firelocks, when his wife Lizzie  Kolken came out of the church with another troop and beckoned to them to  leave him in peace. But they stabbed Lene Hebers as she lay in childbed,  speared the child, and flung it over Claus Peer's hedge among the nettles,  where it was yet lying when they came away. There was not a living soul  left in the village, and still less a morsel of bread, so that unless the  Lord took pity on their need they must all die miserably of hunger.    (Now who is to believe that such people can call themselves Christians!)    I next inquired, when he had done speaking (but with many sighs, as any  one may guess), after my cottage; but of that they knew nought save that  it was still standing. I thanked the Lord therefore with a quiet sigh;  and having asked old Seden what his wife had been doing in the church, I  thought I should have died for grief when I heard that the villains came  out of it with both the chalices and patens in their hands. I therefore  spoke very sharply to old Lizzie, who now came slinking through the  bushes; but she answered insolently that the strange soldiers had forced  her to open the church, as her goodman had crept behind the hedge, and  nobody else was there; that they had gone straight up to the altar, and  seeing that one of the stones was not well fitted (which, truly, was an  arch-lie), had begun to dig with their swords till they found the chalices  and patens; or somebody else might have betrayed the spot to them, so I  need not always to lay the blame on her, and rate her so hardly.    Meanwhile the old men and the women came with a good store of berries;  _item_, my old maid, with the cow's tail and mane, who brought word that  the whole house was turned upside down, the windows all broken, and the  books and writings trampled in the dirt in the midst of the street, and  the doors torn off their hinges. This, however, was a less sorrow to me  than the chalices; and I only bade the people make springes and snares,  in order next morning to begin our fowling, with the help of Almighty God.  I therefore scraped the rods myself until near midnight; and when we had  made ready a good quantity, I told old Seden to repeat the evening  blessing, which we all heard on our knees; after which I wound up with  a prayer, and then admonished the people to creep in under the bushes  to keep them from the cold (seeing that it was now about the end of  September, and the wind blew very fresh from the sea), the men apart, and  the women also apart by themselves. I myself went up with my daughter and  my maid into the cavern, where I had not slept long before I heard old  Seden moaning bitterly because, as he said, he was seized with the colic.  I therefore got up and gave him my place, and sat down again by the fire  to cut springes, till I fell asleep for half an hour; and then morning  broke, and by that time he had got better, and I woke the people to  morning prayer. This time old Paasch had to say it, but could not get  through with it properly, so that I had to help him. Whether he had forgot  it, or whether he was frightened, I cannot say. _Summa_. After we had all  prayed most devoutly, we presently set to work, wedging the springes into  the trees, and hanging berries all around them; while my daughter took  care of the children, and looked for blackberries for their breakfast. Now  we wedged the snares right across the wood along the road to Uekeritze;  and mark what a wondrous act of mercy befell from gracious God! As I  stepped into the road with the hatchet in my hand (it was Seden his  hatchet, which he had fetched out of the village early in the morning), I  caught sight of a loaf as long as my arm, which a raven was pecking, and  which doubtless one of the Imperial troopers had dropped out of his  knapsack the day before, for there were fresh hoofmarks in the sand by it.  So I secretly buttoned the breast of my coat over it, so that none should  perceive anything, although the aforesaid Paasch was close behind me;  _item_, all the rest followed at no great distance. Now, having set the  springes so very early, towards noon we found such a great number of birds  taken in them that Katy Berow, who went beside me while I took them out,  scarce could hold them all in her apron; and at the other end old Pagels  pulled nearly as many out of his doublet and coat pockets. My daughter  then sat down with the rest of the womankind to pluck the birds; and  as there was no salt (indeed it was long since most of us had tasted  any), she desired two men to go down to the sea, and to fetch a little  salt-water in an iron pot borrowed from Staffer Zuter; and so they did. In  this water we first dipped the birds, and then roasted them at a large  fire, while our mouths watered only at the sweet savour of them, seeing it  was so long since we had tasted any food.    And now when all was ready, and the people seated on the earth, I said,  \"Behold how the Lord still feeds his people Israel in the wilderness with  fresh quails: if now he did yet more, and sent us a piece of manna bread  from heaven, what think ye? Would ye then ever weary of believing in him,  and not rather willingly endure all want, tribulation, hunger and thirst,  which he may hereafter lay upon you according to his gracious will?\"  Whereupon they all answered and said, \"Yea, surely!\" _Ego_: \"Will you then  promise me this in truth?\" And they said again, \"Yea, that will we!\" Then  with tears I drew forth the loaf from my breast, held it on high, and  cried, \"Behold, then, thou poor believing little flock, how sweet a manna  loaf your faithful Redeemer hath sent ye through me!\" Whereupon they all  wept, sobbed and groaned; and the little children again came running up  and held out their hands, crying, \"See, bread, bread!\" But as I myself  could not pray for heaviness of soul, I bade Paasch his little girl say  the _Gratias_ the while my Mary cut up the loaf and gave to each his  share. And now we all joyfully began to eat our meat from God in the  wilderness.    Meanwhile I had to tell in what manner I had found the blessed manna  bread, wherein I neglected not again to exhort them to lay to heart this  great sign and wonder, how that God in his mercy had done to them as of  old to the prophet Elijah, to whom a raven brought bread in his great need  in the wilderness; as likewise this bread had been given to me by means of  a raven, which showed it to me, when otherwise I might have passed it by  in my heaviness without ever seeing it.    When we were satisfied with food, I said the thanksgiving from Luke xii.  24, where the Lord saith, \"Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor  reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them:  how much more are ye better than the fowls?\" But our sins stank before  the Lord. For old Lizzie, as I afterwards heard, would not eat her  birds because she thought them unsavoury, but threw them among the  juniper-bushes; whereupon the wrath of the Lord was kindled against us as  of old against the people of Israel, and at night we found but seven birds  in the snares, and next morning but two. Neither did any raven come again  to give us bread. Wherefore I rebuked old Lizzie, and admonished the  people to take upon themselves willingly the righteous chastisement of the  Most High God, to pray without ceasing, to return to their desolate  dwellings, and to see whether the all-merciful God would peradventure give  them more on the sea. That I also would call upon him with prayer night  and day, remaining for a time in the cavern with my daughter and the maid  to watch the springes, and see whether his wrath might be turned from us.  That they should meanwhile put my manse to rights to the best of their  power, seeing that the cold was become very irksome to me. This they  promised me, and departed with many sighs. What a little flock! I counted  but twenty-five souls where there used to be above eighty: all the rest  had been slain by hunger, pestilence, or the sword. I then abode a while  alone and sorrowing in the cave, praying to God, and sent my daughter with  the maid into the village to see how things stood at the manse; _item_, to  gather together the books and papers, and also to bring me word whether  Hinze the carpenter, whom I had straightway sent back to the village, had  knocked together some coffins for the poor corpses, so that I might bury "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#3)"],[1,"ure, the frank  liberality, the indomitable bravery, and the endurance of hardship  that distinguished the race. He was Earl of the West Saxons, and  as such had special claims to their fealty.    London, it was true, did not lie in his earldom, but in that of his  brother Leofwyn, but Leofwyn and Harold were as one--true brothers  in heart and in disposition. The gentleness and courtesy of manner  that, although natural, had been softened and increased by Harold's  contact with foreigners, was not only pardoned but admired because  he was England's champion against foreigners. He had fought, and  victoriously, alike against the Norwegians, the Danes of Northumbria,  and the Welsh, and he struggled as sturdily, though peacefully,  against Norman influence in England. Already the dread of Norman  preponderance was present in the minds of Englishmen. It was no  secret that in his early days Edward had held out hopes, if he had  not given an actual promise, to William of Normandy that he should  succeed him. Of late the king had been somewhat weaned from his  Norman predilections, and had placed himself unreservedly in Harold's  hands, giving to the latter all real power while he confined himself  to the discharge of religious exercises, and to the supervision of  the building of his abbey, varied occasionally by hunting expeditions,  for he still retained a passionate love of the chase; but men knew  that the warlike Duke of Normandy would not be likely to forget the  promise, and that trouble might come to England from over the sea.    Harold, then, they not only regarded as their present ruler, but  as their future king, and as the national leader and champion.  Edward had no children. The royal house was extinct save for Edward  the Atheling, who, like the present king, had lived all his life  abroad, and could have no sympathy with Englishmen. There being,  then, no one of the royal house available, who but Harold, the head  of the great house of Godwin, the earl of the West Saxons, the  virtual ruler of England, could be chosen? The English kings,  although generally selected from the royal house, ruled rather by  the election of the people as declared by their representatives in  the Witan than by their hereditary right. The prince next in  succession by blood might, at the death of the sovereign, be called  king, but he was not really a monarch until elected by the Witan  and formally consecrated.    It had been nine months after he had been acclaimed to the throne  by the people of London that King Edward had been elected king by  the Witan, and formally enthroned. Thus, then, the fact that Harold  did not belong to the royal family mattered but little in the eyes  of Englishmen. To them belonged the right of choosing their own  monarch, and if they chose him, who was to say them nay?    Wulf felt uncomfortable as he followed the stately figure into the  inner room, but he faced the Earl as the door closed behind him  with as fearless a look as that with which he had stood before the  haughty prelate of London. A slight smile played upon Harold's face  as he looked down upon the boy.    \"You are a troublesome varlet, Wulf, and the Lord Bishop has been  making serious complaint of you to the king. He says that you brawled  with his page, Walter Fitz-Urse; that you used insolent words against  his countrymen; and that you even withstood himself. What have you  to say to this?\"    \"The brawling was on the part of the bishop's page and not of mine,  my lord. I was running out to carry the message with which you  charged me to Ernulf of Dover when I ran against Fitz-Urse. That  was not my fault, but a pure mischance, nevertheless I expressed  my regret in fitting terms. Instead of accepting them, he spoke  insolently, talked of chastising me, and put his hand on the hilt  of his dagger. Then, my lord, I grew angry too. Why should I, the  page of Earl Harold, submit to be thus contemptuously spoken to by  this young Norman, who is but the page of an upstart bishop, and  whom, if your lordship will give permission, I would right willingly  fight, with swords or any other weapons. Doubtless, in my anger, I  did not speak respectfully of Walter's countrymen, and for this I  am sorry, since it has been the ground of complaint and of trouble  to you.\"    \"In fact, Wulf, you spoke as a quarrelsome boy and not as the page  of one who has the cares of this kingdom on his shoulders, and whose  great desire is to keep peace between all parties,\" the earl put  in gravely.    For the first time Wulf hung his head:    \"I was wrong, my lord.\"    \"You were wrong, Wulf; it is not good always to say what we think;  and you, as my page, should bear in mind that here at court it  behoves you to behave and to speak not as a headstrong boy, but as  one whose words may, rightly or wrongly, be considered as an echo  of those you may have heard from me. And now to the third charge,  that you withstood the prelate; a matter that, in the king's eyes,  is a very serious one.\"    \"The bishop would give ear to nought I had to say. He listened to  his own page's account and not to mine, and when I said in my defence  that though I did use the words about the Normans, I did so merely  as one boy quarrelling with the other, he said I ought to have my  ears slit. Surely, my lord, a free-born thane is not to be spoken  to even by a Norman bishop as if he were a Norman serf. I only  replied that before there was any slitting of ears your lordship  would have a say in the matter. So far, I admit, I did withstand  the bishop, and I see not how I could have made other reply.\"    \"It would have been better to have held your peace altogether,  Wulf.\"    \"It would, my lord, but it would also surely have been better had  the bishop abstained from talking about slitting ears.\"    \"That would have been better also, but two wrongs do not make a  right. I was present when the bishop made his complaint, and upon  my inquiring more into the matter, his version was somewhat similar  to yours. I then pointed out to him that if holy bishops lost their  tempers and used threats that were beyond their power to carry into  effect, they must not be too severe upon boys who forget the respect  due to their office. Nevertheless, I admitted that you were wrong,  and I promised the king, who was perhaps more disturbed by this  incident than there was any occasion for, that I would take you to  task seriously, and that to avoid any further brawl between you and  young Fitz-Urse, you should for a time be sent away from court. I  did this on the agreement that the bishop should, on his part,  admonish Walter Fitz-Urse against discourteous behaviour and unseemly  brawling, and had I known that he had put his hand on his dagger,  I would have gone further. Have you any witnesses that he did so?\"    \"Yes, my lord; I saw the smith Ulred among those standing by, and  doubtless he would see the action.\"    \"That is well,\" Harold said. \"I shall acquaint the bishop with the  fact when I tell him that I have ordered you to leave for your  estate at Steyning, and that if his page denies it, I have witnesses  to prove the truth of your assertions. I think in that case he will  be glad to drop the matter, for were I to mention the fact to the  king, he, who has a horror of the drawing of weapons, would order  Walter Fitz-Urse to be sent back to Normandy. So your exile is not  likely to be of long duration. You understand, Wulf, that I am not  seriously angered with you in this matter. You are but a boy, and  one cannot expect that you will behave as a prudent man; but remember,  lad, even a boy's words may do mischief, especially when placed as  you are. There may come a time when you shall show by deeds and not  by words your feelings against the Normans, but till then bear  yourself prudently. We Saxons are over given to hasty words, and  this is a fault. I myself, as all men know, have no love for the  Normans, but no one has heard me speak against them. The king loves  them, as is but natural, seeing that he was brought up amongst them,  and I have not withstood his wishes in the matter, trying only that  a certain amount of preferment in the land should be bestowed upon  those who are its owners and not strangers to it and its tongue.  You will ride this afternoon for Steyning, Wulf, but I hope it will  not be long before you are back again. If I had my own way in the  matter, I should think that sufficient had already been said and  done in so trifling a matter as a boys' quarrel; but as it has been  brought before our king by a bishop, it is in the king's eyes a  serious business, for assuredly he himself would have borne a reproof  from William of London more meekly than you did, and having therefore  become a church matter, it is altogether beyond my power to interfere.  At any rate, a short sojourn on your estate will do you no harm;  it is sometime since you were there, and it is a good thing that  the lord of the soil should be well known by those over whom he is  placed.\"    Wulf bowed deeply and withdrew. The prospect of a visit for a few  weeks or even months to Steyning was not a terrible one. It was  some years since he had stayed there for any time. He had been two  years at Waltham, and since his father's death had been for the  most part with Harold, and the thought of an unrestricted life and  of spending his time as he chose, hunting and hawking, and going  about among his tenants, was by no means unpleasant. He was quite  satisfied that Harold was not seriously angered with him, and for  anything else he cared little.    As he understood that his duties as a page were at present at an  end, he thought he would first call upon Ulred the smith, to ask  him if he had seen Walter Fitz-Urse handle his dagger, and also to  tell Osgod that he was going away for a time. He found the smith  at work.    \"Good morning, Master Wulf; though this is not the first time I"]]]
