The ruin of Antichrist, Isa. 63. 4-7.    1 \"I lift my banners,\" saith the Lord,  \"Where Antichrist has stood,  \"The city of my gospel-foes  \"Shall be a field of blood.    2 \"My heart has study'd just revenge,  \"And now the day appears,  \"The day of my redeem'd is come  \"To wipe away their tears.    3 \"Quite weary is my patience grown,  \"And bids my fury go  \"Swift as the lightning it shall move,  \"And be as fatal too.    4 \"I call for helpers but in vain:  \"Then has my gospel none?  \"Well, mine own arm has might enough  \"To crush my foes alone.    5 \"Slaughter and my devouring sword  \"Shall walk the streets around,  \"Babel shall reel beneath my stroke,  \"And stagger to the ground.\"    6 Thy honours, O victorious King!  Thine own right-hand shall raise,  While we thy awful vengeance sing,  And our deliverer praise.      Hymn 1:30.  Prayer for deliverance answered, Isa. 26. 8-12 20 21.    1 In thine own ways, O God of love,  We wait the visits of thy grace,  Our souls desire is to thy Name,  And the remembrance of thy face.    2 My thoughts are searching, Lord, for thee,  'Mongst the black shades of lonesome night;  My earnest cries salute the skies  Before the dawn restore the light.    3 Look, how rebellious men deride  The tender patience of my God;  But they shall see thy lifted hand,  And feel the scourges of thy rod.    4 Hark, the Eternal rends the sky,  A mighty voice before him goes,  A voice of music to his friends,  But threatening thunder to his foes.    5 Come, children, to your Father's arms,  Hide in the chambers of my grace,  Till the fierce storms be overblown,  And my revenging fury cease.    6 My sword shall boast its thousands slain,  And drink the blood of haughty kings,  While heavenly peace around my flock  Stretches its soft and shady wings.      Hymn 1:31. [Supplement.]  The hidden life of a Christian, Col. 3. 3.    1 O happy soul that lives on high;  While men lie grovelling here!  His hopes are fix'd above the sky,  And faith forbids his fear.    2 His conscience knows no secret stings,  While peace and joy combine  To form a life whose holy springs  Are hidden and divine.    3 He waits in secret on his God;  His God in secret sees:  Let earth be all in arms abroad,  He dwells in heavenly peace.    4 His pleasures rise from things unseen,  Beyond this world and time,  Where neither eyes nor ears have been,  Nor thoughts of sinners climb.    5 He wants no pomp nor royal throne  To raise his figure here;  Content and pleas'd to live unknown,  Till Christ his life appear.    6 He looks to heaven's eternal hill  To meet that glorious day:  But patient waits his Saviour's will  To fetch his soul away.      Hymn 1:32.  Strength from heaven, Isa. 40. 27-30.    1 Whence do our mournful thoughts arise?  And where's our courage fled?  Has restless sin and raging hell  Struck all our comforts dead?    2 Have we forgot th' almighty Name  That form'd the earth and sea?  And can an all-creating arm  Grow weary or decay?    3 Treasures of everlasting might  In our Jehovah dwell;  He gives the conquest to the weak,  And treads their foes to hell.    4 Mere mortal power shall fade and die,  And youthful vigour cease;  But we that wait upon the Lord  Shall feel our strength increase.    5 The saints shall mount on eagles' wings  And taste the promis'd bliss,  Till their unwearied feet arrive  Where perfect pleasure is.      Hymn 1:33. [Supplement.]  The gospel the power of God to salvation, Rom. 1. 16.  1 Cor. 1. 18 24.    1 What shall the dying sinner do  That seeks relief for all his woe?  Where shall the guilty conscience find  Ease for the torment of the mind?    2 How shall we get our crimes forgiven,  Or form our natures fit for heaven?  Can souls all o'er defil'd with sin  Make their own powers and passions clean?    3 In vain we search, in vain we try,  Till Jesus bring his gospel nigh;  'Tis there such power and glory dwell  As saves rebellious souls from hell.    4 This is the pillar of our hope  That bears our fainting spirits up;  We read the grace, we trust the word,  And find salvation in the Lord.    5 Let men or angels dig the mines  Where nature's golden treasure shines,  Brought near the doctrine of the cross  All nature's gold appears but dross.    6 Should vile blasphemers with disdain  Pronounce the truths of Jesus vain,  I'll meet the scandal and the shame,  And sing and triumph in his Name.      Hymn 1:34. [Supplement.]  None excluded from hope, Rom. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 24.    1 Jesus, thy blessings are not few,  Nor is thy gospel weak;  Thy grace can melt the stubborn Jew,  And bow th' aspiring Greek.    2 Wide as the reach of Satan's rage  Doth thy salvation flow;  'Tis not confin'd to sex or age,  The lofty or the low.    3 While grace is offer'd to the prince,  The poor may take their share;  No mortal has a just pretence  To perish in despair.    4 Be wise, ye men of strength and wit,  Nor boast your native powers;  But to his sovereign grace submit,  And glory shall be yours.    5 Come, all ye vilest sinners come,  He'll form your souls anew:  His gospel and his heart have room  For rebels such as you.    6 His doctrine is almighty love;  There's virtue in his Name  To turn the raven to a dove,  The lion to a lamb.      Hymn 1:35. [Supplement.]  Truth, sincerity, &c. Phil. 4. 8.    1 Let those who bear the Christian name  Their holy vows fulfil:  The saints, the followers of the Lamb,  Are men of honour still.    2 True to the solemn oath they take,  Tho' to their hurt they swear;  Constant and just to all they speak,  For God and angels hear.    3 Still with their lips their hearts agree,  Nor flattering words devise,  They know the God of truth can see  Thro' every false disguise.    4 They hate th' appearance of a lie  In all the shapes it wears;  They live the truth; and, when they die,  Eternal life is theirs.    5 While hypocrites and liars fly  Before the Judge's frown,  His faithful friends, who fear a lie,  Receive th' immortal crown.      Hymn 1:36. [Supplement.]  A lovely carriage.    1 O 'tis a lovely thing to see  A man of prudent heart,  Whose thoughts, and lips, and life agree  To act a useful part.    2 When envy, strife, and wars begin,  In little angry souls,  Mark how the sons of peace come in,  And quench the kindling coals.    3 Their minds are humble, mild, and meek,  Nor let their fury rise;  Nor passion moves their lips to speak,  Nor pride exalts their eyes.    4 Their frame is prudence mix'd with love,  Good works fulfil their day:  They join the serpent with the dove,  But cast the sting away.    5 Such was the Saviour of mankind;  Such pleasures he pursu'd;  His flesh and blood were all refin'd,  His soul divinely good.    6 Lord, can these plants of virtue grow  In such a heart as mine?  Thy grace my nature can renew,  And make my soul like thine.      Hymn 1:37. [Supplement.]  Zeal and Fortitude.    1 Do I believe what Jesus saith,  And think the gospel true?  Lord, make me bold to own my faith,  And practise virtue too.    2 Suppress my shame, subdue my fear,  Arm me with heavenly zeal,  That I may make thy power appear,  And works of praise fulfil.    3 If men shall see my virtue shine,  And spread my name abroad,  Thine is the power, the praise is thine,  My Saviour and my God.    4 Thus when the saints in glory meet,  Their lips proclaim thy grace;  They cast their honours at thy feet,  And own their borrow'd rays.    PAUSE.    5 Are we the soldiers of the cross?  The followers of the Lamb?  And shall we fear to own his cause,  Or blush to speak his name?    6 Now we must fight, if we would reign;  Increase our courage, Lord!  We'll bear the toil, endure the pain,  Supported by thy word.    7 Thy saints in all this glorious war  Shall Conquer tho' they're slain;  They see the triumph from afar,  And shall with Jesus reign.    8 When that illustrious day shall rise,  And all thy armies shine  In robes of victory thro' the skies,  The glory shall be thine.      Hymn 1:38. [Supplement.]  The universal law of equity. Matt. 8. 12.    1 Blessed Redeemer how divine,  How righteous is this rule of thine,  \"To do to all men just the same  \"As we expect or wish from them.\"    2 This golden lesson, short and plain,  Gives not the mind nor memory pain;  And every conscience must approve  This universal law of love.    3 How blest would every nation be,  Thus rul'd by love and equity!  All would be friends without a foe,  And form a paradise below.    4 Jesus, forgive us, that we keep  Thy sacred law of love asleep,  No more let envy, wrath, and pride,  But thy blest maxims be our guide.      Hymn 1:39.  God's tender care of his church, Isa. 13 &c.    1 How shall my inward joys arise  And burst into a song,  Almighty love inspires my heart,  And pleasure tunes my tongue.    2 God on his thirsty Sion-hill  Some mercy-drops has thrown,  And solemn oaths have bound his love  To shower salvation down.    3 Why do we then indulge our fears,  Suspicions and complaints?  Is he a God, and shall his grace  Grow weary of his saints?    4 Can a kind woman e'er forget  The infant of her womb,  And 'mongst a thousand tender thoughts  Her suckling have no room?    5 \"Yet (saith the Lord) should nature change,  \"And mothers monsters prove,  \"Sion still dwells upon the heart  \"Of everlasting love.    6 \"Deep on the palms of both my hands  \"I have engrav'd her name,  \"My hands shall raise her ruin'd walls,  \"And build her broken frame.\"      Hymn 1:40.  The business and blessedness of glorified saints,  Rev. 7. 13 &c.    1 \"What happy men, or angels these  \"That all their robes are spotless white?  \"Whence did this glorious troop arrive  \"At the pure realms of heavenly light?\"    2 From tort'ring racks and burning fires,  And seas of their own blood they came;  But nobler blood has wash'd their robes,  Flowing from Christ the dying Lamb.    3 Now they approach th' almighty throne,  With loud hosannas night and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#4)"],[1,"rs. Hammond  were to say, \"Will you have green peas or nettle-tops?\" I believe you  would all say, \"Peas, if you please!\" So we had better look for a flower  that you may like better. We will go to Ashmead, where the cows are  grazing, and will find some Clover.    Mr. Hammond grows Clover in some of his fields every year. Those of you  who have been at Willow Farm before, and have walked about the farmer's  fields, know this, for we saw the bailiff sowing Clover broadcast.  Besides the fields of Clover, however, there is always plenty of it  growing among the meadow grass. We find some directly we go through the  gate into Ashmead. It is a plant with a bright purplish-red blossom.  Let us sit down and examine it carefully.    The blossom is a little knob, or ball of colour, almost round. It is  made up of a great many little purple stalks, standing upright and very  close together. Pull a few of these stalks from the blossom and put  their lower ends between your lips. They are quite sweet like sugar.  Nearly all flowers contain honey, or rather _nectar_ of which the bees  make honey. Some flowers have much nectar, some less, and some have none  at all; the Clover contains a great deal.    Now look at the leaves; each has three leaflets. If you can find a leaf  with four of these leaflets, the country children will think you very  fortunate, for a four-leaved Clover is said to bring good luck, just  as a four-leaved Shamrock does in Ireland. A four-leaved Clover is,  however, rather rare; I hope you may find one, but I am rather afraid  you will not.    Here is another Clover, not quite so handsome as the Red Clover at  which we have just been looking; the flowers are white, and are rather  smaller. This is White or Dutch Clover. It is a perennial plant, and one  which spreads over a great deal of ground if it is allowed to do so.  We saw, you remember, that the ivy-leaved Toadflax on the wall by the  foldyard steps sent out fresh roots from its stems as it grew. The White  Clover does the same. The stems creep along the ground, send out fresh  roots, and in this way the plant spreads quickly.    Keeping a few stems of both these clovers in our hands we will go a  little further up the lane. There, in a field, we shall see something  that even country people cannot see every day. The Clover which farmers  usually sow is either the Red Clover or the White, or else another kind  called Alsike. This year Mr. Hammond has sown a field with a fourth  kind--Crimson Clover.    Did you ever see a more beautiful sight? The whole field is a blaze of  rich crimson colour. I shall never forget the day I first saw a field  of Crimson Clover. I was so delighted that I asked the farmer--not Mr.  Hammond, but another friend--if he would have a field of it for me to  admire every year! He said he would tell me by and by. At the end of the  year he said he did not find it such a useful food for his animals as  the Red and White Clovers, and he should not sow it again--at least not  very soon. You see pretty things are not always the most useful.    Let us see what differences we can find between the three clovers we  have gathered. We look first at the blossoms. That of the Red Clover is,  as we have said, like a little round ball, or knob. The flower of the  White Clover is of much the same shape, but is less fine. The flower of  the Crimson Clover is altogether different in shape. It has indeed many  small crimson stems, but these do not form a round ball. They are  arranged in the form of a little circular cone or pyramid which is large  at the bottom and pointed at the top.    [Illustration: CLOVER LEAVES. 1. White; 2. Crimson; 3. Red.]    There are other differences. Immediately below the flower of the Red  Clover is a pair of leaves; the blossom is said to be \"sessile\" or  seated on these leaves. Other leaves, and also other blossoms, grow  on the same stem. Now look at the White Clover. The blossom grows on  a stalk without any leaves or other blossoms on it--only the single  blossom at the top of the stalk. The blossom of the Crimson Clover has  leaves below it.    To-day we easily distinguish one clover from the others by the flowers.  Supposing, however, that we looked at them some day before the flowers  were out; what then? Are there any differences in the leaves? All three  have leaves formed of three leaflets--they are trefoils--but the leaves  are otherwise different.    Those of the Red Clover grow on stems branching from the flower stem,  and sometimes on the flower stem itself. Both leaves and stems are  hairy, and on the leaves there is generally a white mark, something the  shape of a horseshoe.    The leaves of the White Clover grow, like the flower, at the top of the  stem--a single leaf on each stem. The under sides of the leaves are  smooth and glossy. The leaves of the Crimson Clover grow on the flower  stems like those of the Red Clover; but the leaflets are broader and  rounder than the Red Clover leaflets. The Crimson Clover is an annual,  while the others are perennials.    All these clovers are good food for the farmer's animals or stock. The  Red Clover is, perhaps, the most useful. Bees, however, prefer the White  Clover, for they can more easily get at its nectar.    Sheep are exceedingly fond of Clover, but Mr. Hammond is always careful  not to turn them into a field of Clover when they are very hungry,  or to let them stray in by accident. If they got in they would eat it  ravenously, and many would very likely die. Too hearty a meal of Clover  has the same effect on them as a great quantity of new bread would have  on you or me.    We have spent so much time this morning looking at the clovers that we  have only a minute or two to stand at the gate of a field of beans. The  blossoms are pretty--white with dark spots--and they are very fragrant.  A field of beans in flower gives us one of the most delightful of all  country scents.          CHAPTER VI    IN \"ASHMEAD\"      There are many other flowers besides the Clover in Ashmead to-day, and  this afternoon we will look at some that grow among the grass. One of  these you may perhaps call a weed, yet it is one of the most beautiful  wild flowers in England. I mean the golden Dandelion.    On a lawn or in a garden bed it would certainly be a weed, and a very  troublesome one. Here among the grass we need only think of it as a very  lovely flower. See what a rich golden yellow the little florets of the  blossom are. Plants like the Dandelion, in which the blossom is composed  of a number of florets, are called \"composite\" plants.    If we examine the plant closely we shall find that each stalk which  bears a blossom, and each long deeply indented leaf, grows, like the  flower-stem and leaf of the Primrose, from a very short underground  stem. It is from the indented leaves that the Dandelion gets its name.  The leaves have something the appearance of the teeth of a lion. Now  the French name for lion's tooth is _dent de lion_, and we English have  corrupted this into _dandelion._    Each flower-stem is round and, when we pull one, we see that it is a  hollow tube. We bite a piece of the stalk as we did with the Clover  blossom. What a difference! The Clover was quite sweet, but the  Dandelion is very bitter. You may not like the taste perhaps, but the  white milky-looking juice is quite wholesome. Dandelion tea and  Dandelion beer are often made by country people, and the leaves give a  pleasant flavour to a salad.    Shall we pull up a plant and examine the root? I am afraid we cannot,  unless you care to go back to the house for a fork or a trowel. The  Dandelion has a very long strong root--tap-root--which goes deep into  the ground; and there is no tall main stem of which we can take  hold--the leaves and flower stalks only break off in our hands.    Here is a stalk from which the flower has fallen, leaving only the seed.  Of what does it remind you? Of the Traveller's Joy in autumn? Yes; the  Dandelion has what is called a \"pappus\" attached to its seed, rather  similar to the feathery tail of the Traveller's Joy. This makes the  Dandelion a troublesome weed; the seeds are easily carried by the wind  and, if a patch of dandelions is allowed to go to seed, it will produce  fresh plants quite far away. Before the seeds are scattered each head is  like a round white fluffy ball.    Here are daisies, with their dainty white florets often tinged with  pink. In the centre of each blossom is a yellow spot. Every night the  white florets fold up over the yellow centre, and do not open until the  morning. This fact explains to us the Daisy's name; it is the Day's Eye  which opens at dawn and shuts at night.    The Daisy is a little flower which everyone knows and loves, yet in the  wrong place it is a weed. It is a perennial and it spreads very fast. Of  course both perennials and annuals spread by means of their seed, but  perennials also spread in other ways as well. We will see how the Daisy  does this.    There; with my pocket knife I have easily dug up a plant. The root is  small and compact, not long like that of the Dandelion. But, when I try  to lift the Daisy plant from the grass, I find that it is still held  down by a stout tough thread branching from the root. This thread is  connected with another Daisy plant; from that one there is another  thread connected with a third plant. When we have at last got our plant  clear away from the ground, three more are hanging to it by these  threads.    That is how the Daisy spreads; it throws out these thread-like shoots  from the root, and from these grow another root and plant. I knew only  too well what we should find; there are far too many daisies in my lawn  at home, and I found out long ago the way in which they spread so fast.  If daisies are allowed to increase in this way they form large clumps  which smother and kill the grass. We notice that each flower-stem and  each leaf of the Daisy "]]]
