[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8578"],[0,"The Grand Inquisitor (#3)"],[1," three propositions offered Thee by the  powerful and all-wise spirit in the wilderness? Judging of them by  their marvelous aptness alone, one can at once perceive that they  emanated not from a finite, terrestrial intellect, but indeed,  from the Eternal and the Absolute. In these three offers we find,  blended into one and foretold to us, the complete subsequent  history of man; we are shown three images, so to say, uniting in  them all the future axiomatic, insoluble problems and  contradictions of human nature, the world over. In those days, the  wondrous wisdom contained in them was not made so apparent as it  is now, for futurity remained still veiled; but now, when fifteen  centuries have elapsed, we see that everything in these three  questions is so marvelously foreseen and foretold, that to add to,  or to take away from, the prophecy one jot, would be absolutely  impossible!    \"'Decide then thyself.' sternly proceeded the Inquisitor, 'which  of ye twain was right: Thou who didst reject, or he who offered?  Remember the subtle meaning of question the first, which runs  thus: Wouldst Thou go into the world empty-handed? Would Thou  venture thither with Thy vague and undefined promise of freedom,  which men, dull and unruly as they are by nature, are unable so  much as to understand, which they avoid and fear?--for never was  there anything more unbearable to the human race than personal  freedom! Dost Thou see these stones in the desolate and glaring  wilderness? Command that these stones be made bread--and mankind  will run after Thee, obedient and grateful like a herd of cattle.  But even then it will be ever diffident and trembling, lest Thou  should take away Thy hand, and they lose thereby their bread!  Thou didst refuse to accept the offer for fear of depriving men  of their free choice; for where is there freedom of choice where  men are bribed with bread? Man shall not live by bread  alone--was Thine answer. Thou knewest not, it seems, that it was  precisely in the name of that earthly bread that the terrestrial  spirit would one day rise against, struggle with, and finally  conquer Thee, followed by the hungry multitudes shouting: \"Who is  like unto that Beast, who maketh fire come down from heaven upon  the earth!\" Knowest Thou not that, but a few centuries hence, and  the whole of mankind will have proclaimed in its wisdom and  through its mouthpiece, Science, that there is no more crime,  hence no more sin on earth, but only hungry people? \"Feed us  first and then command us to be virtuous!\" will be the words  written upon the banner lifted against Thee--a banner which  shall destroy Thy Church to its very foundations,  and in the  place of Thy Temple shall raise once more the terrible Tower of  Babel; and though its building be left unfinished, as was that of  the first one, yet the fact will remain recorded that Thou  couldst, but wouldst not, prevent the attempt to build that new  tower by accepting the offer, and thus saving mankind a  millennium of useless suffering on earth. And it is to us that  the people will return again. They will search for us catacombs,  as we shall once more be persecuted and martyred--and they will  begin crying unto us: \"Feed us, for they who promised us the fire  from heaven have deceived us!\" It is then that we will finish  building their tower for them. For they alone who feed them shall  finish it, and we shall feed them in Thy name, and lying to them  that it is in that name. Oh, never, never, will they learn to  feed themselves without our help! No science will ever give them  bread so long as they remain free, so long as they refuse to lay  that freedom at our feet, and say: \"Enslave, but feed us!\" That  day must come when men will understand that freedom and daily  bread enough to satisfy all are unthinkable and can never be had  together, as men will never be able to fairly divide the two  among themselves. And they will also learn that they can never be  free, for they are weak, vicious, miserable nonentities born  wicked and rebellious. Thou has promised to them the bread of  life, the bread of  heaven; but I ask Thee again, can that bread  ever equal in the sight of the weak and the vicious, the ever  ungrateful human race, their daily bread on earth? And even  supposing that thousands and tens of thousands follow Thee in the  name of, and for the sake of, Thy heavenly bread, what will  become of the millions and hundreds of millions of human beings  to weak to scorn the earthly for the sake of Thy heavenly bread?  Or is it but those tens of thousands chosen among the great and  the mighty, that are so dear to Thee, while the remaining  millions, innumerable as the grains of sand in the seas, the weak  and the loving, have to be used as material for the former? No,  no! In our sight and for our purpose the weak and the lowly are  the more dear to us. True, they are vicious and rebellious, but  we will force them into obedience, and it is they who will admire  us the most. They will regard us as gods, and feel grateful to  those who have consented to lead the masses and bear their burden  of freedom by ruling over them--so terrible will that freedom at  last appear to men! Then we will tell them that it is in  obedience to Thy will and in Thy name that we rule over them. We  will deceive them once more and lie to them once again--for  never, never more will we allow Thee to come among us. In this  deception we will find our suffering, for we must needs lie  eternally, and never cease to lie!    \"Such is the secret meaning of \"temptation\" the first, and that  is what Thou didst reject in the wilderness for the sake of that  freedom which Thou didst prize above all. Meanwhile Thy tempter's  offer contained another great world-mystery. By accepting the  \"bread,\" Thou wouldst have satisfied and answered a universal  craving, a ceaseless longing alive in the heart of every  individual human being, lurking in the breast of collective  mankind, that most perplexing problem--\"whom or what shall we  worship?\" There exists no greater or more painful anxiety for a  man who has freed himself from all religious bias, than how he  shall soonest find a new object or idea to worship. But man seeks  to bow before that only which is recognized by the greater  majority, if not by all his fellow-men, as having a right to be  worshipped; whose rights are so unquestionable that men agree  unanimously to bow down to it. For the chief concern of these  miserable creatures is not to find and worship the idol of their  own choice, but to discover that which all others will believe  in, and consent to bow down to in a mass. It is that instinctive  need of having a worship in common that is the chief suffering of  every man, the chief concern of mankind from the beginning of  times. It is for that universality of religious worship that  people destroyed each other by sword. Creating gods unto  themselves, they forwith began appealing to each other: \"Abandon  your deities, come and bow down to ours, or death to ye and your  idols!\" And so will they do till the end of this world; they will  do so even then, when all the gods themselves have disappeared,  for then men will prostrate themselves before and worship some  idea. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not be ignorant of, that  mysterious fundamental principle in human nature, and still thou  hast rejected the only absolute banner offered Thee, to which all  the nations would remain true, and before which all would have  bowed--the banner of earthly bread, rejected in the name of  freedom and of \"bread in the kingdom of God\"! Behold, then, what  Thou hast done furthermore for that \"freedom's\" sake! I repeat to  Thee, man has no greater anxiety in life than to find some one to  whom he can make over that gift of freedom with which the  unfortunate creature is born. But he alone will prove capable of  silencing and quieting their consciences, that shall succeed in  possessing himself of the freedom of men. With \"daily bread\" an  irresistible power was offered Thee: show a man \"bread\" and he  will follow Thee, for what can he resist less than the attraction  of bread? But if, at the same time, another succeed in possessing  himself of his conscience--oh! then even Thy bread will be  forgotten, and man will follow him who seduced his conscience. So  far Thou wert right. For the mystery of human being does not  solely rest in the desire to live, but in the problem--for what  should one live at all? Without a clear perception of his reasons  for living, man will never consent to live, and will rather  destroy himself than tarry on earth, though he be surrounded with  bread. This is the truth. But what has happened? Instead of  getting hold of man's freedom, Thou has enlarged it still more!  Hast Thou again forgotten that to man rest and even death are  preferable to a free choice between the knowledge of Good and  Evil? Nothing seems more seductive in his eyes than freedom of  conscience, and nothing proves more painful. And behold! instead  of laying a firm foundation whereon to rest once for all man's  conscience, Thou hast chosen to stir up in him all that is  abnormal, mysterious, and indefinite, all that is beyond human  strength, and has acted as if Thou never hadst any love for him,  and yet Thou wert He who came to \"lay down His life for His  friends!\" Thou hast burdened man's soul with anxieties hitherto  unknown to him. Thirsting for human love freely given, seeking to  enable man, seduced and charmed by Thee, to follow Thy path of  his own free-will, instead of the old and wise law which held him  in subjection, Thou hast given him the right henceforth to choose  and freely decide what is good and bad for him, guided but by  Thine image in his heart. But hast Thou never dreamt of the  probability, nay, of the certainty, of that same man one day  rejected finally, and controverting even Thine image and Thy  truth, once "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#3)"],[1,"her a brazier  with a little fire. After that she bade her retire, and shut the  door. When she was alone, she took a piece of aloes out of a box,  and put it into the brazier. As soon as she saw the smoke rise, she  repeated some words unknown to the King of Persia, who from a  recess observe with great attention all that she did. She had no  sooner ended, than the sea began to be disturbed. At length the sea  opened at some distance; and presently there rose out of it a tall,  handsome young man, with moustaches of a sea-green colour; a little  behind him, a lady, advanced in years, but of a majestic air,  attended by five young ladies, nowise inferior in beauty to the  Queen Gulnare.    Queen Gulnare immediately went to one of the windows, and saw the  king her brother, the queen her mother, and the rest of her  relations, who at the same time perceived her also. The company  came forward, borne, as it were, upon the surface of the waves.  When they came to the edge, they nimbly, one after another, sprang  up to the window, from whence Queen Gulnare had retired to make  room for them. King Saleh, the queen her mother, and the rest of  her relations, embraced her tenderly, with tears in their eyes, on  their first entrance.    After Queen Gulnare had received them with all imaginable honour,  and made them sit down upon a sofa, the queen her mother addressed  herself to her: 'Daughter,' said she, 'I am overjoyed to see you  again after so long an absence; and I am confident that your  brother and your relations are no less so. Your leaving us without  acquainting anybody with it involved us in inexpressible concern;  and it is impossible to tell you how many tears we have shed upon  that account. We know of no other reason that could induce you to  take such a surprising step, but what your brother told us of the  conversation that passed between him and you. The advice he gave  you seemed to him at that time very advantageous for settling you  handsomely in the world, and very suitable to the then posture of  our affairs. If you had not approved of his proposal, you ought not  to have been so much alarmed; and, give me leave to tell you, you  took the thing in a quite different light from what you ought to  have done. But no more of this; we and you ought now to bury it for  ever in oblivion: give us an account of all that has happened to  you since we saw you last, and of your present situation; but  especially let us know if you are satisfied.'    Queen Gulnare immediately threw herself at her mother's feet; and  after rising and kissing her hand, 'I own,' said she, 'I have been  guilty of a very great fault, and I am indebted to your goodness  for the pardon which you are pleased to grant me.' She then related  the whole of what had befallen her since she quitted the sea.    As soon as she had acquainted them with her having been sold to the  King of Persia, in whose palace she was at present; 'Sister,' said  the king her brother, 'you now have it in your power to free  yourself. Rise, and return with us into my kingdom, that I have  reconquered from the proud usurper who had made himself master of  it.'    The King of Persia, who heard these words from the recess where he  was concealed, was in the utmost alarm. 'Ah!' said he to himself,  'I am ruined; and if my queen, my Gulnare, hearkens to this advice,  and leaves me, I shall surely die.' But Queen Gulnare soon put him  out of his fears.    'Brother,' said she, smiling, 'I can scarce forbear being angry  with you for advising me to break the engagement I have made with  the most puissant and most renowned monarch in the world. I do not  speak here of an engagement between a slave and her master; it  would be easy to return the ten thousand pieces of gold that I cost  him; but I speak now of a contract between a wife and a husband,  and a wife who has not the least reason to complain. He is a  religious, wise, and temperate king. I am his wife, and he has  declared me Queen of Persia, to share with him in his councils.  Besides, I have a child, the little Prince Beder. I hope then  neither my mother, nor you, nor any of my cousins, will disapprove  of the resolution or the alliance I have made, which will be an  equal honour to the kings of the sea and the earth. Excuse me for  giving you the trouble of coming hither from the bottom of the  deep, to communicate it to you, and for the pleasure of seeing you  after so long a separation.'    'Sister,' replied King Saleh, 'the proposal I made you of going  back with us into my kingdom was only to let you see how much we  all love you, and how much I in particular honour you, and that  nothing in the world is so dear to me as your happiness.'    The queen confirmed what her son had just spoken, and addressing  herself to Queen Gulnare, said, 'I am very glad to hear you are  pleased; and I have nothing else to add to what your brother has  just said to you. I should have been the first to have condemned  you, if you had not expressed all the gratitude you owe to a  monarch that loves you so passionately, and has done such great  things for you.'    When the King of Persia, who was still in the recess, heard this he  began to love her more than ever, and resolved to express his  gratitude in every possible way.    Presently Queen Gulnare clapped her hands, and in came some of her  slaves, whom she had ordered to bring in a meal: as soon as it was  served up, she invited the queen her mother, the king her brother,  and her cousins, to sit down and take part of it. They began to  reflect, that without asking leave, they had got into the palace of  a mighty king, who had never seen nor heard of them, and that it  would be a great piece of rudeness to eat at his table without him.  This reflection raised a blush in their faces; in their emotion  their eyes glowed like fire, and they breathed flames at their  mouths and nostrils.    This unexpected sight put the King of Persia, who was totally  ignorant of the cause of it, into a dreadful consternation. Queen  Gulnare suspecting this, and understanding the intention of her  relations, rose from her seat, and told them she would be back in a  moment. She went directly to the recess, and recovered the King of  Persia from his surprise.    'Sir,' said she, 'give me leave to assure you of the sincere  friendship that the queen my mother and the king my brother are  pleased to honour you with: they earnestly desire to see you, and  tell you so themselves: I intended to have some conversation with  them by ordering a banquet for them, before I introduced them to  your majesty, but they are very impatient to pay their respects to  you: and therefore I desire your majesty would be pleased to walk  in, and honour them with your presence.'    'Madam,' said the King of Persia, 'I should be very glad to salute  persons that have the honour to be so nearly related to you, but I  am afraid of the flames that they breathe at their mouths and  nostrils.'    'Sir,' replied the queen, laughing, 'you need not in the least be  afraid of those flames, which are nothing but a sign of their  unwillingness to eat in your palace, without your honouring them  with your presence, and eating with them.'    The King of Persia, encouraged by these words, rose up, and came  out into the room with his Queen Gulnare. She presented him to the  queen her mother, to the king her brother, and to her other  relations, who instantly threw themselves at his feet, with their  faces to the ground. The King of Persia ran to them, and lifting  them up, embraced them one after another. After they were all  seated, King Saleh began: 'Sir,' said he to the King of Persia, 'we  are at a loss for words to express our joy to think that the queen  my sister should have the happiness of falling under the protection  of so powerful a monarch. We can assure you she is not unworthy of  the high rank you have been pleased to raise her to; and we have  always had so much love and tenderness for her, that we could never  think of parting with her to any of the puissant princes of the  sea, who often demanded her in marriage before she came of age.  Heaven has reserved her for you, Sir, and we have no better way of  returning thanks to it for the favour it has done her, than by  beseeching it to grant your majesty a long and happy life with her,  and to crown you with prosperity and satisfaction.'    'Certainly,' replied the King of Persia, 'I cannot sufficiently  thank either the queen her mother, or you, Prince, or your whole  family, for the generosity with which you have consented to receive  me into an alliance so glorious to me as yours.' So saying, he  invited them to take part of the luncheon, and he and his queen sat  down at the table with them. After it was over, the King of Persia  conversed with them till it was very late; and when they thought it  time to retire, he waited upon them himself to the several rooms he  had ordered to be prepared for them.    Next day, as the King of Persia, Queen Gulnare, the queen her  mother, King Saleh her brother, and the princesses their relations,  were discoursing together in her majesty's room, the nurse came in  with the young Prince Beder in her arms. King Saleh no sooner saw  him, than he ran to embrace him; and taking him in his arms, fell  to kissing and caressing him with the greatest demonstration of  tenderness. He took several turns with him about the room, dancing  and tossing him about, when all of a sudden, through a transport of  joy, the window being open, he sprang out, and plunged with him  into the sea.    The King of Persia, who expected no such sight, set up a hideous  cry, verily believing that he should either see the dear prince his  son no more, or else that he should see him drowned; and he nearly  died of grief and affliction. 'Sir,' said Queen Gulnare (with a  quiet and undisturbed countenance, the better to comfort him), 'let  your majesty "]]]
