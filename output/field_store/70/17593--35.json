It rather  replies with a mephistophelian grin when he begs for a humane  understanding of his case.    [A] Article 46: \"A person is not subject to punishment, if at the moment  of his deed he was in a mental condition which deprived him of  consciousness or of the freedom of action. But if the judge considers it  dangerous to acquit the prisoner, he has to transfer him to the care of  the proper authorities, who will take the necessary precautions.\"    [B] Article 47: \"If the mental condition mentioned in the foregoing  article was such as to considerably decrease the responsibility, without  eliminating it entirely, the penalty fixed upon the crime committed is  reduced according to the following rules:    \"I. In place of penitentiary, imprisonment for not less than six years.    \"II. In place of the permanent loss of civic rights, a loss of these  rights for a stipulated time.    \"III. Whenever it is a question of a penalty of more than twelve years,  it is reduced to from three to ten years; if of more than six years, but  not more than twelve, it is reduced to from one to five years; in other  cases, the reduction is to be one-half of the ordinary penalty.    \"IV. A fine is reduced to one-half.    \"V. If the penalty would be a restriction of personal liberty, the judge  may order the prisoner to a workhouse, until the proper authorities  object, when the remainder of the sentence is carried out in the usual  manner.\"    It is true that there is now and then in those halls of justice, which  remain all too frequently closed to the living wave of public sentiment,  some more intelligent and serene judge who is touched by this painful  understanding of the actual human life. Then he may, under the illogical  conditions of penal justice, with its compromise between the exactness  of the classic and that of the positive school of criminology, seek for  some expedient which may restore him to equanimity.    In 1832, France introduced a penal innovation, which seemed to represent  an advance on the field of justice, but which is in reality a denial of  justice: The expedient of _extenuating circumstances_. The judge does  not ask for the advice of the court physician in the case of some  forlorn criminal, but condemns him without a word of rebuke to society  for its complicity. But in order to assuage his own conscience he grants  him extenuating circumstances, which seem a concession of justice, but  are, in reality, a denial of justice. For you either believe that a man  is responsible for his crime, and in that case the concession of  extenuating circumstances is a hypocrisy; or you grant them in good  faith, and then you admit that the man was in circumstances which  reduced his moral responsibility, and thereby the extenuating  circumstances become a denial of justice. For if your conviction  concerning such circumstances were sincere, you would go to the bottom  of them and examine with the light of your understanding all those  innumerable conditions which contribute toward those extenuating  circumstances. But what are those extenuating circumstances? Family  conditions? Take it that a child is left alone by its parents, who are  swallowed up in the whirl of modern industry, which overthrows the laws  of nature and forbids the necessary rest, because steam engines do not  get tired and day work must be followed by night work, so that the  setting of the sun is no longer the signal for the laborer to rest, but  to begin a new shift of work. Take it that this applies not alone to  adults, but also to human beings in the growing stage, whose muscular  power may yield some profit for the capitalists. Take it that even the  mother, during the period of sacred maternity, becomes a cog in the  machinery of industry. And you will understand that the child must grow  up, left to its own resources, in the filth of life, and that its  history will be inscribed in criminal statistics, which are the shame of  our so-called civilization.    Of course, in this first lecture I cannot give you even a glimpse of the  positive results of that modern science which has studied the criminal  and his environment instead of his crimes. And I must, therefore, limit  myself to a few hints concerning the historical origin of the positive  school of criminology. I ought to tell you something concerning the  question of free will. But you will understand that such a momentous  question, which is worthy of a deep study of the many-sided physical,  moral, intellectual life, cannot be summed up in a few short words. I  can only say that the tendency of modern natural sciences, in physiology  as well as psychology, has overruled the illusions of those who would  fain persist in watching psychological phenomena merely within  themselves and think that they can understand them without any other  means. On the contrary, positive science, backed by the testimony of  anthropology and of the study of the environment, has arrived at the  following conclusions: The admission of a free will is out of the  question. For if the free will is but an illusion of our internal being,  it is not a real faculty possessed by the human mind. Free will would  imply that the human will, confronted by the choice of making  voluntarily a certain determination, has the last decisive word under  the pressure of circumstances contending for and against this decision;  that it is free to decide for or against a certain course independently  of internal and external circumstances, which play upon it, according to  the laws of cause and effect.    Take it that a man has insulted me. I leave the place in which I have  been insulted, and with me goes the suggestion of forgiveness or of  murder and vengeance. And then it is assumed that a man has his complete  free will, unless he is influenced by circumstances explicitly  enumerated by the law, such as minority, congenital deaf-muteness,  insanity, habitual drunkenness and, to a certain extent, violent  passion. If a man is not in a condition mentioned in this list, he is  considered in possession of his free will, and if he murders he is held  morally responsible and therefore punished.    This illusion of a free will has its source in our inner consciousness,  and is due solely to the ignorance in which we find ourselves concerning  the various motives and different external and internal conditions which  press upon our mind at the moment of decision.    If a man knows the principal causes which determine a certain  phenomenon, he says that this phenomenon is inevitable. If he does not  know them, he considers it as an accident, and this corresponds in the  physical field to the arbitrary phenomenon of the human will which does  not know whether it shall decide this way or that. For instance, some of  us were of the opinion, and many still are, that the coming and going of  meteorological phenomena was accidental and could not he foreseen. But  in the meantime, science has demonstrated that they are likewise subject  to the law of causality, because it discovered the causes which enable  us to foresee their course. Thus weather prognosis has made wonderful  progress by the help of a network of telegraphically connected  meteorological stations, which succeeded in demonstrating the connection  between cause and effect in the case of hurricanes, as well as of any  other physical phenomenon. It is evident that the idea of accident,  applied to physical nature, is unscientific. Every physical phenomenon  is the necessary effect of the causes that determined it beforehand. If  those causes are known to us, we have the conviction that that  phenomenon is necessary, is fate, and, if we do not know them, we think  it is accidental. The same is true of human phenomena. But since we do  not know the internal and external causes in the majority of cases, we  pretend that they are free phenomena, that is to say, that they are not  determined necessarily by their causes. Hence the spiritualistic  conception of the free will implies that every human being, in spite of  the fact that their internal and external conditions are necessarily  predetermined, should be able to come to a deliberate decision by the  mere fiat of his or her free will, so that, even though the sum of all  the causes demands a no, he or she can decide in favor of yes, and vice  versa. Now, who is there that thinks, when deliberating some action,  what are the causes that determine his choice? We can justly say that  the greater part of our actions are determined by habit, that we make up  our minds almost from custom, without considering the reason for or  against. When we get up in the morning we go about our customary  business quite automatically, we perform it as a function in which we do  not think of a free will. We think of that only in unusual and grave  cases, when we are called upon to make some special choice, the  so-called voluntary deliberation, and then we weigh the reasons for or  against; we ponder, we hesitate what to do. Well, even in such cases, so  little depends on our will in the deliberations which we are about to  take that if any one were to ask us one minute before we have decided  what we are going to do, we should not know what we were going to  decide. So long as we are undecided, we cannot foresee what we are going  to decide; for under the conditions in which we live that part of the  psychic process takes place outside of our consciousness. And since we  do not know its causes, we cannot tell what will be its effects. Only  after we have come to a certain decision can we imagine that it was due  to our voluntary action. But shortly before we could not tell, and that  proves that it did not depend on us alone.

If you leave a study door  unlocked in these strenuous times, the first thing you know is, somebody  comes right in, sits down, and begins to talk about himself. I think  with a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently  comfortable. That putrid calendar must come down, though. Do you think  you could make a long arm, and haul it off the parent tintack? Thanks.  We make progress. We make progress.\"    \"We shall jolly well make it out of the window,\" said Mike, spooning up  tea from a paperbag with a postcard, \"if a sort of young Hackenschmidt  turns up and claims the study. What are you going to do about it?\"    \"Don't let us worry about it. I have a presentiment that he will be an  insignificant-looking little weed. How are you getting on with the  evening meal?\"    \"Just ready. What would you give to be at Eton now? I'd give something  to be at Wrykyn.\"    \"These school reports,\" said Psmith sympathetically, \"are the very  dickens. Many a bright young lad has been soured by them. Hello, what's  this, I wonder.\"    A heavy body had plunged against the door, evidently without a suspicion  that there would be any resistance. A rattling of the handle followed,  and a voice outside said, \"Dash the door!\"    \"Hackenschmidt!\" said Mike.    \"The weed,\" said Psmith. \"You couldn't make a long arm, could you, and  turn the key? We had better give this merchant audience. Remind me later  to go on with my remarks on school reports. I had several bright things  to say on the subject.\"    Mike unlocked the door, and flung it open. Framed in the entrance was a  smallish, freckled boy, wearing a pork-pie hat and carrying a bag. On  his face was an expression of mingled wrath and astonishment.    Psmith rose courteously from his chair, and moved forward with slow  stateliness to do the honors.    \"What the dickens,\" inquired the newcomer, \"are you doing here?\"    \"We were having a little tea,\" said Psmith, \"to restore our tissues  after our journey. Come in and join us. We keep open house, we Psmiths.  Let me introduce you to Comrade Jackson. A stout fellow. Homely in  appearance, perhaps, but one of us. I am Psmith. Your own name will  doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the teacups.\"    \"My name's Spiller, and this is my study.\"    Psmith leaned against the mantelpiece, put up his eyeglass, and  harangued Spiller in a philosophical vein.    \"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,\" said he, \"the saddest are these:  'It might have been.' Too late! That is the bitter cry. If you had torn  yourself from the bosom of the Spiller family by an earlier train, all  might have been well. But no. Your father held your hand and said  huskily, 'Edwin, don't leave us!' Your mother clung to you weeping, and  said, 'Edwin, stay!' Your sisters--\"    \"I want to know what--\"    \"Your sisters froze on to your knees like little octopuses (or octopi),  and screamed, 'Don't go, Edwin!' And so,\" said Psmith, deeply affected  by his recital, \"you stayed on till the later train; and, on arrival,  you find strange faces in the familiar room, a people that know not  Spiller.\" Psmith went to the table, and cheered himself with a sip of  tea. Spiller's sad case had moved him greatly.    The victim of Fate seemed in no way consoled.    \"It's beastly cheek, that's what I call it. Are you new chaps?\"    \"The very latest thing,\" said Psmith.    \"Well, it's beastly cheek.\"    Mike's outlook on life was of the solid, practical order. He went  straight to the root of the matter.    \"What are you going to do about it?\" he asked.    Spiller evaded the question.    \"It's beastly cheek,\" he repeated. \"You can't go about the place bagging  studies.\"    \"But we do,\" said Psmith. \"In this life, Comrade Spiller, we must be  prepared for every emergency. We must distinguish between the unusual  and the impossible. It is unusual for people to go about the place  bagging studies, so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption  that it is impossible. Error! Ah, Spiller, Spiller, let this be a  lesson to you.\"    \"Look here, I tell you what it--\"    \"I was in a car with a man once. I said to him: 'What would happen if  you trod on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing?' He  said, 'I couldn't. One's the foot brake, and the other's the  accelerator.' 'But suppose you did?' I said. 'I wouldn't,' he said. 'Now  we'll let her rip.' So he stamped on the accelerator. Only it turned out  to be the foot brake after all, and we stopped dead, and skidded into a  ditch. The advice I give to every young man starting life is: 'Never  confuse the unusual and the impossible.' Take the present case. If you  had only realized the possibility of somebody someday collaring your  study, you might have thought out dozens of sound schemes for dealing  with the matter. As it is, you are unprepared. The thing comes on you as  a surprise. The cry goes round: 'Spiller has been taken unawares. He  cannot cope with the situation.'\"    \"Can't I! I'll--\"    \"What _are_ you going to do about it?\" said Mike.    \"All I know is, I'm going to have it. It was Simpson's last term, and  Simpson's left, and I'm next on the house list, so, of course, it's  my study.\"    \"But what steps,\" said Psmith, \"are you going to take? Spiller, the man  of Logic, we know. But what of Spiller, the Man of Action? How do you  intend to set about it? Force is useless. I was saying to Comrade  Jackson before you came in, that I didn't mind betting you were an  insignificant-looking little weed. And you _are_ an  insignificant-looking little weed.\"    \"We'll see what Outwood says about it.\"    \"Not an unsound scheme. By no means a scaly project. Comrade Jackson and  myself were about to interview him upon another point. We may as well  all go together.\"    The trio made their way to the Presence, Spiller pink and determined,  Mike sullen, Psmith particularly debonair. He hummed lightly as he  walked, and now and then pointed out to Spiller objects of interest by  the wayside.    Mr. Outwood received them with the motherly warmth which was evidently  the leading characteristic of his normal manner.    \"Ah, Spiller,\" he said. \"And Smith, and Jackson. I am glad to see you  have already made friends.\"    \"Spiller's, sir,\" said Psmith, laying a hand patronizingly on the  study-claimer's shoulder--a proceeding violently resented by  Spiller--\"is a character one cannot help but respect. His nature expands  before one like some beautiful flower.\"    Mr. Outwood received this eulogy with rather a startled expression, and  gazed at the object of the tribute in a surprised way.    \"Er--quite so, Smith, quite so,\" he said at last. \"I like to see boys in  my house friendly toward one another.\"    \"There is no vice in Spiller,\" pursued Psmith earnestly. \"His heart is  the heart of a little child.\"    \"Please, sir,\" burst out this paragon of all the virtues, \"I--\"    \"But it was not entirely with regard to Spiller that I wished to speak  to you, sir, if you were not too busy.\"    \"Not at all, Smith, not at all. Is there anything ...\"    \"Please, sir--\" began Spiller    \"I understand, sir,\" said Psmith, \"that there is an Archaeological  Society in the school.\"    Mr. Outwood's eyes sparkled behind their pince-nez. It was a  disappointment to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to his  chosen band. Cricket and football, games that left him cold, appeared to  be the main interest in their lives. It was but rarely that he could  induce new boys to join. His colleague, Mr. Downing, who presided over  the School Fire Brigade, never had any difficulty in finding support.  Boys came readily at his call. Mr. Outwood pondered wistfully on this at  times, not knowing that the Fire Brigade owed its support to the fact  that it provided its lighthearted members with perfectly unparalleled  opportunities for ragging, while his own band, though small, was, in the  main, earnest.    \"Yes, Smith,\" he said, \"Yes. We have a small Archaeological Society.  I--er--in a measure look after it. Perhaps you would care to become  a member?\"    \"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.    \"One moment, Spiller. Do you want to join, Smith?\"    \"Intensely, sir. Archaeology fascinates me. A grand pursuit, sir.\"    \"Undoubtedly, Smith. I am very pleased, very pleased indeed. I will put  down your name at once.\"    \"And Jackson's, sir.\"    \"Jackson, too!\" Mr. Outwood beamed. \"I am delighted. Most delighted.  This is capital. This enthusiasm is most capital.\"    \"Spiller, sir,\" said Psmith sadly, \"I have been unable to induce to  join.\"    \"Oh, he is one of our oldest members.\"    \"Ah,\" said Psmith, tolerantly, \"that accounts for it.\"    \"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.    \"One moment, Spiller. We shall have the first outing of the term on  Saturday. We intend to inspect the Roman Camp at Embury Hill, two miles  from the school.\"    \"We shall be there, sir.\"    \"Capital!\"    \"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.    \"One moment, Spiller,\" said Psmith. \"There is just one other matter, if  you could spare the time, sir.\"    \"Certainly, Smith. What is that?\"    \"Would there be any objection to Jackson and myself taking Simpson's old  study?\"    \"By all means, Smith. A very good idea.\"    \"Yes, sir. It would give us a place where we could work quietly in the  evenings.\"    \"Quite so. Quite so.\"    \"Thank you very much, sir. We will move our things in.\"    \"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Mike.    \"Please, sir,\" shouted Spiller, \"aren't I to have it? I'm next on the  list, sir. I come next after Simpson. Can't I have it?\"    \"I'm afraid I have already promised it to Smith, Spiller. You should  have spoken before.\"    \"But sir--\"    Psmith eyed the speaker pityingly.    \"This tendency to delay, Spiller,\" he said, \"is your besetting fault.  Correct it, Edwin."]]]
