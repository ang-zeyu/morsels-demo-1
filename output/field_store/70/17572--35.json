LONDON.    PUBLISHED BY J. L. MARKS, 91,    LONG LANE SMITHFIELD.          [Illustration]    THE SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF PUSS IN BOOTS.      [Illustration]        There once liv'd a young man who was very poor.        For all that he had was a Cat;      His food being gone, he could get no more,        And so he resolv'd to kill that.        Now Puss from the cupboard came out and thus spoke,        \"Grieve not my good master, I pray,      Provide me with boots, and a bag--'tis no joke--        Your fortune I'll make then straightway.\"    [Illustration]        Puss baited his bag with parsley and bread,        And away to a warren he hied,      Where he laid himself down as if he was dead,        Until some young rabbits he spied.        One entered the bag, puss pull'd at the string,        The rabbit was kill'd in a trice,      Puss said this fine game I'll take to the king,        I'm sure he will say it is nice.    [Illustration]        Next day to a wheat-field Grimalkin repair'd,        And there two fine partridges caught,      These he took to the king who kindly enquired,        From whence the fine present was brought.        \"From the Marquis Carabas, great Monarch,\" said he,        \"These birds and the rabbit I bring,\"      They both were accepted, and puss in high glee        Receiv'd a reward from the king.    [Illustration]        This king took a journey, his kingdom to view,        With his daughter so fine and so gay,      What happen'd then, I will now tell unto you,        To my tale therefore listen I pray.        Puss ran to a cornfield, to the reapers he said,        \"When the king comes these words you repeat,      'To the Marquis Carabas these fields all belong,        Or I'll chop you as small as minced meat.'\"    [Illustration]        To an Ogre's grand castle grimalkin now went,        Which was opened by servants so gay,      'Is his highness the Ogre at home sir,' said he,        'For my bus'ness is urgent to-day.'        The Ogre received him with kindness, and now,        Puss entr'd the castle so gay,      When making a low and reverend bow,        He march'd to the parlour straightway.    [Illustration]        'Tis thought mighty Ogre by all in the nation,        That miraculous power you possess,      The power, when you please, of complete transformation,        This a miracle is and no less.        To convince you 'tis true, the Ogre replied,        I will change myself now in your sight:      He did so--a lion he now roars by his side,        Which put the poor cat in a fright.    [Illustration]        \"Mighty sir,\" said the Cat, \"such a change I must say,        I never expected to view:      Yet I venture to doubt--your pardon I pray,        If a mouse you could change yourself to.\"        Doubt not, said the Ogre, my power to do so,        When a mouse he directly became,      On his victim Grimalkin immediately flew,        And sealed in an instant his doom.    [Illustration]        The king and princess now arriv'd at the place,        But Puss who had travell'd much faster,      Came out and invited them in with much grace,        In the name of the Marquis, his master.        In a spacious saloon, they sat themselves down,        Where a banquet was already spread,      And that day, \"PUSS IN BOOTS\" gain'd greater renown,        For the marquis and princess were wed.

Further off, the sun,  a splash of white flame, burned vividly against the dark.    An indefinite period passed. Then, for the last time, I saw the  earth--an enduring globule of radiant blue, swimming in an eternity of  ether. And there I, a fragile flake of soul dust, flickered silently  across the void, from the distant blue, into the expanse of the unknown.    A great while seemed to pass over me, and now I could nowhere see  anything. I had passed beyond the fixed stars and plunged into the huge  blackness that waits beyond. All this time I had experienced little,  save a sense of lightness and cold discomfort. Now however the atrocious  darkness seemed to creep into my soul, and I became filled with fear and  despair. What was going to become of me? Where was I going? Even as the  thoughts were formed, there grew against the impalpable blackness that  wrapped me a faint tinge of blood. It seemed extraordinarily remote, and  mistlike; yet, at once, the feeling of oppression was lightened, and I  no longer despaired.    Slowly, the distant redness became plainer and larger; until, as I drew  nearer, it spread out into a great, somber glare--dull and tremendous.  Still, I fled onward, and, presently, I had come so close, that it  seemed to stretch beneath me, like a great ocean of somber red. I could  see little, save that it appeared to spread out interminably in all  directions.    In a further space, I found that I was descending upon it; and, soon, I  sank into a great sea of sullen, red-hued clouds. Slowly, I emerged from  these, and there, below me, I saw the stupendous plain that I had seen  from my room in this house that stands upon the borders of the Silences.    Presently, I landed, and stood, surrounded by a great waste of  loneliness. The place was lit with a gloomy twilight that gave an  impression of indescribable desolation.    Afar to my right, within the sky, there burnt a gigantic ring of  dull-red fire, from the outer edge of which were projected huge,  writhing flames, darted and jagged. The interior of this ring was  black, black as the gloom of the outer night. I comprehended, at once,  that it was from this extraordinary sun that the place derived its  doleful light.    From that strange source of light, I glanced down again to my  surroundings. Everywhere I looked, I saw nothing but the same flat  weariness of interminable plain. Nowhere could I descry any signs of  life; not even the ruins of some ancient habitation.    Gradually, I found that I was being borne forward, floating across the  flat waste. For what seemed an eternity, I moved onward. I was unaware  of any great sense of impatience; though some curiosity and a vast  wonder were with me continually. Always, I saw around me the breadth of  that enormous plain; and, always, I searched for some new thing to break  its monotony; but there was no change--only loneliness, silence,  and desert.    Presently, in a half-conscious manner, I noticed that there was a faint  mistiness, ruddy in hue, lying over its surface. Still, when I looked  more intently, I was unable to say that it was really mist; for it  appeared to blend with the plain, giving it a peculiar unrealness, and  conveying to the senses the idea of unsubstantiality.    Gradually, I began to weary with the sameness of the thing. Yet, it was  a great time before I perceived any signs of the place, toward which I  was being conveyed.    \"At first, I saw it, far ahead, like a long hillock on the surface of  the Plain. Then, as I drew nearer, I perceived that I had been mistaken;  for, instead of a low hill, I made out, now, a chain of great mountains,  whose distant peaks towered up into the red gloom, until they were  almost lost to sight.\"        _III_    THE HOUSE IN THE ARENA    And so, after a time, I came to the mountains. Then, the course of my  journey was altered, and I began to move along their bases, until, all  at once, I saw that I had come opposite to a vast rift, opening into the  mountains. Through this, I was borne, moving at no great speed. On  either side of me, huge, scarped walls of rocklike substance rose sheer.  Far overhead, I discerned a thin ribbon of red, where the mouth of the  chasm opened, among inaccessible peaks. Within, was gloom, deep and  somber, and chilly silence. For a while, I went onward steadily, and  then, at last, I saw, ahead, a deep, red glow, that told me I was near  upon the further opening of the gorge.    A minute came and went, and I was at the exit of the chasm, staring out  upon an enormous amphitheatre of mountains. Yet, of the mountains, and  the terrible grandeur of the place, I recked nothing; for I was  confounded with amazement to behold, at a distance of several miles and  occupying the center of the arena, a stupendous structure built  apparently of green jade. Yet, in itself, it was not the discovery of  the building that had so astonished me; but the fact, which became every  moment more apparent, that in no particular, save in color and its  enormous size, did the lonely structure vary from this house in which  I live.    For a while, I continued to stare, fixedly. Even then, I could scarcely  believe that I saw aright. In my mind, a question formed, reiterating  incessantly: 'What does it mean?' 'What does it mean?' and I was unable  to make answer, even out of the depths of my imagination. I seemed  capable only of wonder and fear. For a time longer, I gazed, noting  continually some fresh point of resemblance that attracted me. At last,  wearied and sorely puzzled, I turned from it, to view the rest of the  strange place on to which I had intruded.    Hitherto, I had been so engrossed in my scrutiny of the House, that I  had given only a cursory glance 'round. Now, as I looked, I began to  realize upon what sort of a place I had come. The arena, for so I have  termed it, appeared a perfect circle of about ten to twelve miles in  diameter, the House, as I have mentioned before, standing in the center.  The surface of the place, like to that of the Plain, had a peculiar,  misty appearance, that was yet not mist.    From a rapid survey, my glance passed quickly upward along the slopes  of the circling mountains. How silent they were. I think that this same  abominable stillness was more trying to me than anything that I had so  far seen or imagined. I was looking up, now, at the great crags,  towering so loftily. Up there, the impalpable redness gave a blurred  appearance to everything.    And then, as I peered, curiously, a new terror came to me; for away up  among the dim peaks to my right, I had descried a vast shape of  blackness, giantlike. It grew upon my sight. It had an enormous equine  head, with gigantic ears, and seemed to peer steadfastly down into the  arena. There was that about the pose that gave me the impression of an  eternal watchfulness--of having warded that dismal place, through  unknown eternities. Slowly, the monster became plainer to me; and then,  suddenly, my gaze sprang from it to something further off and higher  among the crags. For a long minute, I gazed, fearfully. I was strangely  conscious of something not altogether unfamiliar--as though something  stirred in the back of my mind. The thing was black, and had four  grotesque arms. The features showed indistinctly, 'round the neck, I  made out several light-colored objects. Slowly, the details came to me,  and I realized, coldly, that they were skulls. Further down the body was  another circling belt, showing less dark against the black trunk. Then,  even as I puzzled to know what the thing was, a memory slid into my  mind, and straightway, I knew that I was looking at a monstrous  representation of Kali, the Hindu goddess of death.    Other remembrances of my old student days drifted into my thoughts. My  glance fell back upon the huge beast-headed Thing. Simultaneously, I  recognized it for the ancient Egyptian god Set, or Seth, the Destroyer  of Souls. With the knowledge, there came a great sweep of  questioning--'Two of the--!' I stopped, and endeavored to think. Things  beyond my imagination peered into my frightened mind. I saw, obscurely.  'The old gods of mythology!' I tried to comprehend to what it was all  pointing. My gaze dwelt, flickeringly, between the two. 'If--'    An idea came swiftly, and I turned, and glanced rapidly upward,  searching the gloomy crags, away to my left. Something loomed out under  a great peak, a shape of greyness. I wondered I had not seen it earlier,  and then remembered I had not yet viewed that portion. I saw it more  plainly now. It was, as I have said, grey. It had a tremendous head; but  no eyes. That part of its face was blank.    Now, I saw that there were other things up among the mountains. Further  off, reclining on a lofty ledge, I made out a livid mass, irregular and  ghoulish. It seemed without form, save for an unclean, half-animal face,  that looked out, vilely, from somewhere about its middle. And then I saw  others--there were hundreds of them. They seemed to grow out of the  shadows. Several I recognized almost immediately as mythological  deities; others were strange to me, utterly strange, beyond the power of  a human mind to conceive.    On each side, I looked, and saw more, continually. The mountains were  full of strange things--Beast-gods, and Horrors so atrocious and bestial  that possibility and decency deny any further attempt to describe them.  And I--I was filled with a terrible sense of overwhelming horror and  fear and repugnance; yet, spite of these, I wondered exceedingly. Was  there then, after all, something in the old heathen worship, something  more than the mere deifying of men, animals, and elements? The thought  gripped me--was there?    Later, a question repeated itself. What were they, those Beast-gods,  and the others? At first, they had appeared to me just sculptured  Monsters"]]]
