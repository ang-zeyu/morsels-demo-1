This Seth was a good man, and he  gat Enos, and Enos Cainan, and Cainan begot Malaleel, and Malaleel  Jared, and Jared Enoch, and Enoch Methuselah, and Methuselah Lamech, and  Lamech Noah. And like as in the generation of Cain the seventh was the  worst, so in the generation of Seth the seventh was the best, that was  Enoch whom God took and brought him into Paradise, unto the time that he  shall come with Elias for to convert the hearts of the fathers into the  sons. And Adam lived after he had begotten Seth eight hundred years, and  engendered sons and daughters. Some hold opinion thirty sons and thirty  daughters, and some fifty of that one and fifty of that other. We find  no certainty of them in the Bible. But all the days of Adam living here  in earth amount to the sum of nine hundred and thirty years. And in the  end of his life when he should die, it is said, but of none authority,  that he sent Seth his son into Paradise for to fetch the oil of mercy,  where he received certain grains of the fruit of the tree of mercy by an  angel. And when he came again he found his father Adam yet alive and  told him what he had done. And then Adam laughed first and then died.  And then he laid the grains or kernels under his father's tongue and  buried him in the vale of Hebron; and out of his mouth grew three trees  of the three grains, of which trees the cross that our Lord suffered his  passion on was made, by virtue of which he gat very mercy, and was  brought out of darkness into very light of Heaven. To the which he bring  us that liveth and reigneth God, world without end.          HERE BEGINNETH THE HISTORY OF NOAH    _The First Sunday in Sexagesima_      After that Adam was dead, died Eve and was buried by him. At the  beginning, in the first age, the people lived long. Adam lived nine  hundred and thirty years, and Methuselah lived nine hundred and  sixty-nine years. S. Jerome saith that he died the same year that the  flood was. Then Noah was the tenth from Adam in the generation of Seth,  in whom the first age was ended. The seventy interpreters say that this  first age dured two thousand two hundred and forty-four years. S. Jerome  saith not fully two thousand, and Methodius full two thousand, etc.    Noah then was a man perfect and righteous and kept God's commandment.  And when he was five hundred years old, he gat Shem, Ham, and Japhet.  This time men began to multiply on the earth, and the children of God,  that is to say of Seth, as religious, saw the daughters of men, that is  to say of Cain, and took them to their wives. This time was so much sin  on the earth, wherefore God was displeased and determined in his  prescience to destroy man that he had made, and said: I shall put man  away that I have made, and my spirit shall not abide in man for ever,  for he is flesh. As who said, I shall not punish man perpetually as I  do the devil, for man is frail, and yet ere I shall destroy him I shall  give him space and time of repentance and to amend him, if he will. The  time of repentance shall be one hundred and twenty years. Then Noah,  righteous and perfect, walked with God, that is in his laws, and the  earth was corrupt by sin and filled.    When God saw the earth to be corrupt, and that every man was corrupt by  sin upon the earth, he said to Noah: The end of all people is come  tofore me except them that shall be saved, and the earth is replenished  with their wickedness. I shall destroy them with the earth, id est [that  is], with the fertility of the earth. Make to thee an ark of tree, hewn,  polished, and squared. And make there divers places, and lime it with  clay and pitch within and without, that is to wit with glue which is so  fervent, that the timber may not be loosed. And thou shalt make it three  hundred cubits of length, fifty in breadth, and thirty of height. And  make therein divers distinctions of places and chambers and of  wardrobes. And the ark had a door for to enter in and come out, and a  window was made thereon, which that the Hebrews say was of crystal. This  ark was on making, from the beginning that God commanded first to make  it, one hundred and twenty years. In which time Noah oft desired the  people to leave their sin, and how he had spoken with God, and that he  was commanded to make the ship, for God should destroy them for their  sin, but if they left it. And they mocked him and said that he raved  and was a fool, and gave no faith to his saying and continued in their  sin and wickedness. Then, when the ark was perfectly made, God bade him  to take into it of all the beasts of the earth, and also of the fowls of  the air, of each two, male and female, that they may live. And also of  all the meats of the earth that be comestible, that they may serve and  feed thee and them. And Noah did all that our Lord commanded him. Then  said our Lord to Noah: Enter thou and all thy household into the ark,  that is to say thou and thy wife and thy three sons and their three  wives. I have seen that thou art rightful in this generation. Of all  beasts that be clean thou shalt take seven, and of unclean beasts but  only two. And of the birds seven and seven, male and female, that they  may be saved on the face of the earth. Yet after seven days I shall rain  upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and shall destroy all the  substance that I made on the earth. And Noah did all things that our  Lord commanded him.    He was six hundred years old when the flood began on the earth. And then  Noah entered in and his sons, his wife, and the wives of his sons, all  into the ark to eschew the waters of the flood. Of all the beasts and  the fowls, and of all that moved and had life on earth, male and female,  Noah took in to him as our Lord had bidden. And seven days after they  were entered, the water began to increase. The wells of the abysms were  broken, and the cataracts of heaven were opened, that is to say the  clouds, and it rained on the earth forty days and forty nights. And the  ark was elevate and borne upon the waters on height above the mountains  and hills, for the water was grown higher fifteen cubits above all the  mountains, that it should purge and wash the filth of the air. Then was  consumed all that was on the earth living, man, woman, and beast and  birds. And all that ever bare life, so that nothing abode upon the  earth, for the water was fifteen cubits above the highest mountain of  the earth. And when Noah was entered he shut the door fast without  forth, and limed it with glue.    And so the waters abode elevate in height an hundred and fifty days from  the day that Noah entered in. And our Lord then remembered Noah and all  them that were in the ark with him, and also on the beasts and fowls,  and ceased the waters. And the wells and cataracts were closed, and the  rains were prohibited, and forbidden to rain no more. The seventh month,  the twenty-seventh day of the month, the ark rested on the hills of  Armenia. The tenth month, of the first day of the month, the tops of the  hills appeared first. After these forty days after the lessing of the  waters, Noah opened the window and desired sore to have tidings of  ceasing of the flood. And sent out a raven for to have tidings, and when  he was gone he returned no more again, for peradventure she found some  dead carrion of a beast swimming on the water, and lighted thereon to  feed her and was left there. After this he sent out a dove which flew  out, and when she could find no place to rest ne set her foot on, she  returned unto Noah and he took her in. Yet then were not the tops of  the hills bare. And seven days after he sent her out again, which at  even returned, bearing a branch of an olive tree, burgeoning, in her  mouth. And after other seven days he sent her again, which came no more  again.    Then in the year of Noah six hundred and one, the first day of the  month, Noah opened the covering of the ark and saw that the earth was  dry, but he durst not go out, but abode the commandment of our Lord. The  second month, the twenty-seventh day of the month, our Lord said to  Noah: Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of  thy sons. He commanded them to go conjointly out which disjointly  entered, and let go out with them all the beasts and fowls living, and  all the reptiles, every each after his kind and gender, to whom our Lord  said: Grow ye and multiply upon the earth. Then Noah issued out and his  wife, and his sons with their wives, and all the beasts, the same day a  year after they entered in, every one after his gender. Noah then  edified an altar to our Lord and took of all the beasts that were clean  and offered sacrifice unto our Lord; and our Lord smelled the sweetness  of the sacrifice and said to Noah: From henceforth I shall not curse the  earth for man, for he is prone and ready to fall from the beginning of  his youth. I shall no more destroy man by such vengeance. And then our  Lord blessed them and said: Grow ye and multiply the earth and be ye  lords of all the beasts of the earth, of the fowls of the air, and of  the fishes. I have given all things to you, but eat no flesh with the  blood. I command you to slay no man, nor to shed no man's blood. I have  made man after mine image. Whosomever sheddeth his brother's blood, his  blood shall be shed. Go ye forth and grow and multiply and fill the  earth. This said our Lord to Noah and his sons: Lo! I have made a  covenant with you and with them that shall come after you, that I shall  no more bring such a flood to slay all people, and in token thereof I  have set my rainbow in the clouds of heaven, for who that trespasseth I  shall do justice otherwise on him. Noah lived after the flood three  hundred and fifty years. From the time of Adam until after Noah's flood,  the time and season was alway green and tempered; and all that time men  ate no flesh, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],[0,"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#4)"],[1,"as far     as Icollo i Bengo--Sugar Manufactory--Geology of this part of     the Country--Women spinning Cotton--Its Price--Native Weavers--     Market-places--Cazengo; its Coffee Plantations--South     American Trees--Ruins of Iron Foundry--Native Miners--The     Banks of the Lucalla--Cottages with Stages--Tobacco-plants--     Town of Massangano--Sugar and Rice--Superior District for     Cotton--Portuguese Merchants and foreign Enterprise--Ruins--     The Fort and its ancient Guns--Former Importance of     Massangano--Fires--The Tribe Kisama--Peculiar Variety of     Domestic Fowl--Coffee Plantations--Return to Golungo Alto--     Self-complacency of the Makololo--Fever--Jaundice--Insanity.
