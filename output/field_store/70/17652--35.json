Thus the  state of New York is mentioned in the table as having 161 newspapers;  but a late publication states that there are 193, exclusive of  religious journals. New York has 1,913,508 inhabitants. There are  about 50 daily newspapers in the United States, two-thirds of which  are considered to give a fair profit. The North American colonies, in  the year 1720, had only seven newspapers: in 1810, the United States  had 359; in 1826, they had 640; in 1830, 1,000, with a population  of 13,000,000; so that they have more newspapers than the whole 190  millions of Europe.    In drawing a comparison between the newspapers of the three freest  countries, France, England, and the United States, we find, as we have  just said, those of the last country to be the most numerous, while  some of the French papers have the largest subscription; and the whole  establishment of a first-rate London paper is the most complete. Its  activity is immense. When Canning sent British troops to Portugal, in  1826, we know that some papers sent reporters with the army. The zeal  of the New York papers also deserves to be mentioned, which send  out their news-boats, even fifty miles to sea, to board approaching  vessels, and obtain the news that they bring. The papers of the large  Atlantic cities are also remarkable for their detailed accounts of  arrivals, and the particulars of shipping news, interesting to the  commercial world, in which they are much more minute than the English.  From the immense number of different papers in the United States, it  results that the number of subscribers to each is limited, 2,000 being  considered a respectable list. One paper, therefore, is not able to  unite the talent of many able men, as is the case in France. There  men of the first rank in literature or politics occasionally, or at  regular periods, contribute articles. In the United States, few papers  have more than one editor, who generally writes upon almost all  subjects himself. This circumstance necessarily makes the papers less  spirited and able than some of the foreign journals, but is attended  with this advantage, that no particular set of men is enabled to  exercise a predominant influence by means of these periodicals. Their  abundance neutralizes their effects. Declamation and sophistry are  made comparatively harmless by running in a thousand conflicting  currents.    _Paper-making_.--The manufacture of paper has of late rapidly  increased in the United States. According to an estimate in 1829, the  whole quantity made in this country amounted to about five to seven  millions a year, and employed from ten to eleven thousand persons.  Rags are not imported from Italy and Germany to the same amount as  formerly, because people here save them more carefully; and the value  of the rags, junk, etc., saved annually in the United States, is  believed to amount to two millions of dollars. Machines for making  paper of any length are much employed in the United States. The  quality of American paper has also improved; but, as paper becomes  much better by keeping, it is difficult to have it of the best quality  in this country, the interest of capital being too high. The paper  used here for printing compares very disadvantageously with that of  England. Much wrapping paper is now made of straw, and paper for  tracing through is prepared in Germany from the poplar tree. A letter  of Mr. Brand, formerly a civil officer in Upper Provence, in France  (which contains many pine forests), dated Feb. 12, 1830, has been  published in the French papers, containing an account of his  successful experiments to make coarse paper of the pine tree. The  experiments of others have led to the same results. Any of our  readers, interested in this subject, can find Mr. Brand's letter in  the _Courrier Francais_ of Nov. 27, 1830, a French paper published  in New York. In salt-works near Hull, Massachusetts, in which the  sea-water is made to flow slowly over sheds of pine, in order to  evaporate, the writer found large quantities of a white substance--the  fibres of the pine wood dissolved and carried off by the brine--which  seemed to require nothing but glue to convert it into paper.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST           *       *       *       *       *      THE CUTTLE-FISH      Is one of the most curious creatures of \"the watery kingdom.\" It is  popularly termed a fish, though it is, in fact, a worm, belonging to  the order termed _Mollusca, (Molluscus_, soft,) from the body being of  a pulpy substance and having no skeleton. It differs in many respects  from other animals of its class, particularly with regard to its  internal structure, the perfect formation of the viscera, eyes, and  even organs of hearing. Moreover, \"it has three hearts, two of which  are placed at the root of the two branchiae (or gills); they receive  the blood from the body, and propel it into the branchiae. The  returning veins open into the middle heart, from which the aorta  proceeds.\"[7] Of Cuttle-fish there are several species. That  represented in the annexed Cut is the common or officinal Cuttle-fish,  (_Sepia officinalis_, Lin). It consists of a soft, pulpy, body, with  processes or arms, which are furnished with small holes or suckers,  by means of which the animal fixes itself in the manner of  cupping-glasses. These holes increase with the age of the animal; and  in some species amount to upwards of one thousand. The arms are often  torn or nipped off by shell or other fishes, but the animal has the  power of speedily reproducing the limbs. By means of the suckers the  Cuttle-fish usually affects its locomotion. \"It swims at freedom in  the bosom of the sea, moving by sudden and irregular jerks, the body  being nearly in a perpendicular position, and the head directed  downwards and backwards. Some species have a fleshy, muscular fin  on each side, by aid of which they accomplish these apparently  inconvenient motions; but, at least, an equal number of them are  finless, and yet can swim with perhaps little less agility. Lamarck,  indeed, denies this, and says that these can only trail themselves  along the bottom by means of the suckers. This is probably their  usual mode of proceeding; that it is not their only one, we have the  positive affirmation of other observers.\"[8] Serviceable as these arms  undoubtedly are to the Cuttle-fish, Blumenbach thinks it questionable  whether they can be considered as organs of touch, in the more limited  sense to which he has confined that term.[9]      THE CUTTLE-FISH.      [Illustration: The Cuttle-fish.]      The jaws of the Cuttle-fish, it should be observed, are fixed in the  body because there is no head to which they can be articulated. They  are of horny substance, and resemble the bill of a parrot. They are in  the centre of the under part of the body, surrounded by the arms. By  means of these parts, the shell-fish which are taken for food, are  completely triturated.        [7] Cuvier.        [8] Nat. Hist. Molluscous Animals, Mag. Nat. Hist. vol. iii.          p. 527.        [9] Manual Comp. Anat. p. 263.    We now come to the most peculiar parts of the structure of the  Cuttle-fish, viz. the _ear and eye_, inasmuch as it is the only animal  of its class, in which any thing has hitherto been discovered, at  all like an organ of hearing, or that has been shown to possess true  eyes.[10] The ears consist of two oval cavities, in the cartilaginous  ring, to which the large arms of the animal are affixed. In each of  these is a small bag, containing a bony substance, and receiving the  termination of the nerves, like those of the vestibulum (or cavity  in the bone of the ear) in fishes. The nature of the eyes cannot be  disputed. \"They resemble, on the whole, those of red-blooded animals,  particularly fishes; they are at least incomparably more like them  than the eyes of any known insects; yet they are distinguished by  several extraordinary peculiarities. The front of the eye-ball is  covered with a loose membrane instead of a cornea; the iris is  composed of a firm substance; and a process projects from the upper  margin of the pupil, which gives that membrane a semilunar form.\"[11]  The exterior coat or ball is remarkably strong, so as to seem almost  calcareous, and is, when taken out, of a brilliant pearl colour; it  is worn in some parts of Italy, and in the Grecian islands by way of  artificial pearl in necklaces.        [10] In all other worms the eyes are entirely wanting, or their           existence is very doubtful. Whether the black points at the           extremities of what Swammerdam calls the horns of the common           snail, are organs which really possess the power of vision,           is still problematical.        [11] Blumenbach, Man. Comp. Anat. p. 305.    Next we may notice the curious provision by which the Cuttle-fish is  enabled to elude the pursuit of its enemies in the \"vasty deep.\" This  consists of a black, inky fluid, (erroneously supposed to be the  bile,) which is contained in a bag beneath the body. The fluid itself  is thick, but miscible with water to such a degree, that a very small  quantity will colour a vast bulk of water.[12] Thus, the comparatively  small Cuttle-fish may darken the element about the acute eye of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1159"],[0,"Fire-Tongue (#4)"],[1," now assured and he required no  further evidence upon this point.    As he took his seat at the dining table he observed that Sir Charles's  collection had overflowed even into this room. In the warm shadows about  him were pictures and ornaments, all of which came from, or had been  inspired by, the Far East.    In this Oriental environment lay an inspiration. The terror which had  come into Sir Charles's life, the invisible menace which, swordlike,  hung over him, surely belonged in its eerie quality to the land of  temple bells, of silent, subtle peoples, to the secret land which has  bred so many mysteries. Yes, he must look into the past, into the Indian  life of Sir Charles Abingdon, for the birth of this thing which now had  grown into a shadow almost tangible.    Benson attended at table, assisted by a dark-faced and very  surly-looking maid, in whom Harley thought he recognized the  housekeeper's bete noire.    When presently both servants had temporarily retired. \"You see, Mr.  Harley,\" began Sir Charles, glancing about his own room in a manner  almost furtive, \"I realized to-day at your office that the history of  this dread which has come upon me perhaps went back so far that it was  almost impossible to acquaint you with it under the circumstances.\"    \"I quite understand.\"    \"I think perhaps I should inform you in the first place that I have a  daughter. Her mother has been dead for many years, and perhaps I have  not given her the attention which a motherless girl is entitled to  expect from her father. I don't mean,\" he said, hastily, \"that we are in  any sense out of sympathy, but latterly in some way I must confess that  we have got a little out of touch.\" He glanced anxiously at his guest,  indeed almost apologetically. \"You will of course understand, Mr.  Harley, that this seeming preamble may prove to have a direct bearing  upon what I propose to tell you?\"    \"Pray tell the story in your own way, Sir Charles,\" said Harley with  sympathy. \"I am all attention, and I shall only interrupt you in the  event of any point not being quite clear.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Sir Charles. \"I find it so much easier to explain  the matter now. To continue, there is a certain distinguished Oriental  gentleman--\"    He paused as Benson appeared to remove the soup plates.    \"It is always delightful to chat with one who knows India so well as you  do,\" he continued, glancing significantly at his guest.    Paul Harley, who fully appreciated the purpose of this abrupt change  in the conversation, nodded in agreement. \"The call of the East,\" he  replied, \"is a very real thing. Only one who has heard it can understand  and appreciate all it means.\"    The butler, an excellently trained servant, went about his work with  quiet efficiency, and once Harley heard him mutter rapid instructions to  the surly parlourmaid, who hovered disdainfully in the background.  When again host and guest found themselves alone: \"I don't in any way  distrust the servants,\" explained Sir Charles, \"but one cannot hope  to prevent gossip.\" He raised his serviette to his lips and almost  immediately resumed: \"I was about to tell you, Mr. Harley, about my  daughter's--\"    He paused and cleared his throat, then, hastily pouring out a glass of  water, he drank a sip or two and Paul Harley noticed that his hand was  shaking nervously. He thought of the photograph in the library, and now,  in this reference to a distinguished Oriental gentleman, he suddenly  perceived the possible drift of the conversation.    This was the point to which Sir Charles evidently experienced such  difficulty in coming. It was something which concerned his daughter;  and, mentally visualizing the pure oval face and taunting eyes of the  library photograph, Harley found it impossible to believe that the evil  which threatened Sir Charles could possibly be associated in any way  with Phyllis Abingdon.    Yet, if the revelation which he had to make must be held responsible for  his present condition, then truly it was a dreadful one. No longer able  to conceal his concern, Harley stood up. \"If the story distresses you so  keenly, Sir Charles,\" he said, \"I beg--\"    Sir Charles waved his hand reassuringly. \"A mere nothing. It will pass,\"  he whispered.    \"But I fear,\" continued Harley, \"that--\"    He ceased abruptly, and ran to his host's assistance, for the latter,  evidently enough, was in the throes of some sudden illness or seizure.  His fresh-coloured face was growing positively livid, and he plucked at  the edge of the table with twitching fingers. As Harley reached his side  he made a sudden effort to stand up, throwing out his arm to grasp the  other's shoulder.    \"Benson!\" cried Harley, loudly. \"Quick! Your master is ill!\"    There came a sound of swift footsteps and the door was thrown open.    \"Too late,\" whispered Sir Charles in a choking voice. He began to clutch  his throat as Benson hurried into the room.    \"My God!\" whispered Harley. \"He is dying!\"    Indeed, the truth was all too apparent. Sir Charles Abingdon was almost  past speech. He was glaring across the table as though he saw some  ghastly apparition there. And now with appalling suddenness he became as  a dead weight in Harley's supporting grasp. Raspingly, as if forced in  agony from his lips:    \"Fire-Tongue,\" he said... \"Nicol Brinn...\"    Benson, white and terror-stricken, bent over him.    \"Sir Charles!\" he kept muttering. \"Sir Charles! What is the matter,  sir?\"    A stifled shriek sounded from the doorway, and in tottered Mrs. Howett,  the old housekeeper, with other servants peering over her shoulder into  that warmly lighted dining room where Sir Charles Abingdon lay huddled  in his own chair--dead.        CHAPTER III. SHADOWS    \"Had you reason to suspect any cardiac trouble, Doctor McMurdoch?\" asked  Harley.    Doctor McMurdoch, a local practitioner who had been a friend of Sir  Charles Abingdon, shook his head slowly. He was a tall, preternaturally  thin Scotsman, clean-shaven, with shaggy dark brows and a most gloomy  expression in his deep-set eyes. While the presence of his sepulchral  figure seemed appropriate enough in that stricken house, Harley could  not help thinking that it must have been far from reassuring in a sick  room.    \"I had never actually detected anything of the kind,\" replied the  physician, and his deep voice was gloomily in keeping with his  personality. \"I had observed a certain breathlessness at times, however.  No doubt it is one of those cases of unsuspected endocarditis. Acute.  I take it,\" raising his shaggy brows interrogatively, \"that nothing had  occurred to excite Sir Charles?\"    \"On the contrary,\" replied Harley, \"he was highly distressed about some  family trouble, the nature of which he was about to confide to me when  this sudden illness seized him.\"    He stared hard at Doctor McMurdoch, wondering how much he might hope to  learn from him respecting the affairs of Sir Charles. It seemed almost  impertinent at that hour to seek to pry into the dead man's private  life.    To the quiet, book-lined apartment stole now and again little  significant sounds which told of the tragedy in the household. Sometimes  when a distant door was opened, it would be the sobs of a weeping woman,  for the poor old housekeeper had been quite prostrated by the blow. Or  ghostly movements would become audible from the room immediately over  the library--the room to which the dead man had been carried; muffled  footsteps, vague stirrings of furniture; each sound laden with its own  peculiar portent, awakening the imagination which all too readily filled  in the details of the scene above. Then, to spur Harley to action, came  the thought that Sir Charles Abingdon had appealed to him for aid. Did  his need terminate with his unexpected death or would the shadow under  which he had died extend now? Harley found himself staring across the  library at the photograph of Phil Abingdon. It was of her that Sir  Charles had been speaking when that mysterious seizure had tied his  tongue. That strange, fatal illness, mused Harley, all the more strange  in the case of a man supposedly in robust health--it almost seemed  like the working of a malignant will. For the revelation, whatever  its nature, had almost but not quite been made in Harley's office that  evening. Something, some embarrassment or mental disability, had stopped  Sir Charles from completing his statement. Tonight death had stopped  him.    \"Was he consulting you professionally, Mr. Harley?\" asked the physician.    \"He was,\" replied Harley, continuing to stare fascinatedly at the  photograph on the mantelpiece. \"I am informed,\" said he, abruptly, \"that  Miss Abingdon is out of town?\"    Doctor McMurdoch nodded in his slow, gloomy fashion. \"She is staying in  Devonshire with poor Abingdon's sister,\" he answered. \"I am wondering  how we are going to break the news to her.\"    Perceiving that Doctor McMurdoch had clearly been intimate with the  late Sir Charles, Harley determined to make use of this opportunity to  endeavour to fathom the mystery of the late surgeon's fears. \"You will  not misunderstand me, Doctor McMurdoch,\" he said, \"if I venture to ask  you one or two rather personal questions respecting Miss Abingdon?\"    Doctor McMurdoch lowered his shaggy brows and looked gloomily at the  speaker. \"Mr. Harley,\" he replied, \"I know you by repute for a man of  integrity. But before I answer your questions will you answer one of  mine?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then my question is this: Does not your interest cease with the death  of your client?\"    \"Doctor McMurdoch,\" said Harley, sternly, \"you no doubt believe yourself  to be acting as a friend of this bereaved family. You regard me,  perhaps, as a Paul Pry prompted by idle curiosity. On the contrary, I  find myself in a delicate and embarrassing situation. From Sir Charles's  conversation I had gathered that he entertained certain fears on behalf  of his "]]]
