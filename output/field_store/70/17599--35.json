But if indeed they do exist and look after things, still if  there is nothing communicated from them to men, nor in fact to myself,  how even so is it right (to follow them)? The wise and good man then,  after considering all these things, submits his own mind to him who  administers the whole, as good citizens do to the law of the state. He  who is receiving instruction ought to come to be instructed with this  intention, How shall I follow the gods in all things, how shall I be  contented with the divine administration, and how can I become free? For  he is free to whom everything happens according to his will, and whom no  man can hinder. What then, is freedom madness? Certainly not; for  madness and freedom do not consist. But, you say, I would have  everything result just as I like, and in whatever way I like. You are  mad, you are beside yourself. Do you not know that freedom is a noble  and valuable thing? But for me inconsiderately to wish for things to  happen as I inconsiderately like, this appears to be not only not noble,  but even most base. For how do we proceed in the matter of writing? Do I  wish to write the name of Dion as I choose? No, but I am taught to  choose to write it as it ought to be written. And how with respect to  music? In the same manner. And what universally in every art or science?  Just the same. If it were not so, it would be of no value to know  anything, if knowledge were adapted to every man's whim. Is it then in  this alone, in this which is the greatest and the chief thing, I mean  freedom, that I am permitted to will inconsiderately? By no means; but  to be instructed is this, to learn to wish that everything may happen as  it does. And how do things happen? As the disposer has disposed them?  And he has appointed summer and winter, and abundance and scarcity, and  virtue and vice, and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole;  and to each of us he has given a body, and parts of the body, and  possessions, and companions.    What then remains, or what method is discovered of holding commerce with  them? Is there such a method by which they shall do what seems fit to  them, and we not the less shall be in a mood which is conformable to  nature? But you are unwilling to endure, and are discontented; and if  you are alone, you call it solitude; and if you are with men, you call  them knaves and robbers; and you find fault with your own parents and  children, and brothers and neighbors. But you ought when you are alone  to call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom, and to  think yourself like to the gods; and when you are with many, you ought  not to call it crowd, nor trouble, nor uneasiness, but festival and  assembly, and so accept all contentedly.    What then is the punishment of those who do not accept? It is to be what  they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone? Let him be alone.  Is a man dissatisfied with his parents? Let him be a bad son, and  lament. Is he dissatisfied with his children? Let him be a bad father.  Cast him into prison. What prison? Where he is already, for he is there  against his will; and where a man is against his will, there he is in  prison. So Socrates was not in prison, for he was there willingly. Must  my leg then be lamed? Wretch, do you then on account of one poor leg  find fault with the world? Will you not willingly surrender it for the  whole? Will you not withdraw from it? Will you not gladly part with it  to him who gave it? And will you be vexed and discontented with the  things established by Zeus, which he, with the Moirae (fates) who were  present and spinning the thread of your generation, defined and put in  order? Know you not how small a part you are compared with the whole. I  mean with respect to the body, for as to intelligence you are not  inferior to the gods nor less; for the magnitude of intelligence is not  measured by length nor yet by height, but by thoughts.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW EVERYTHING MAY BE DONE ACCEPTABLY TO THE GODS.--When some one asked,  How may a man eat acceptably to the gods, he answered: If he can eat  justly and contentedly, and with equanimity, and temperately, and  orderly, will it not be also acceptable to the gods? But when you have  asked for warm water and the slave has not heard, or if he did hear has  brought only tepid water, or he is not even found to be in the house,  then not to be vexed or to burst with passion, is not this acceptable to  the gods? How then shall a man endure such persons as this slave? Slave  yourself, will you not bear with your own brother, who has Zeus for his  progenitor, and is like a son from the same seeds and of the same  descent from above? But if you have been put in any such higher place,  will you immediately make yourself a tyrant? Will you not remember who  you are, and whom you rule? That they are kinsmen, that they are  brethren by nature, that they are the offspring of Zeus? But I have  purchased them, and they have not purchased me. Do you see in what  direction you are looking, that it is towards the earth, towards the  pit, that it is towards these wretched laws of dead men? but towards the  laws of the gods you are not looking.           *       *       *       *       *    WHAT PHILOSOPHY PROMISES.--When a man was consulting him how he should  persuade his brother to cease being angry with him, Epictetus replied:  Philosophy does not propose to secure for a man any external thing. If  it did (or if it were not, as I say), philosophy would be allowing  something which is not within its province. For as the carpenter's  material is wood, and that of the statuary is copper, so the matter of  the art of living is each man's life. When then is my brother's? That  again belongs to his own art; but with respect to yours, it is one of  the external things, like a piece of land, like health, like reputation.  But Philosophy promises none of these. In every circumstance I will  maintain, she says, the governing part conformable to nature. Whose  governing part? His in whom I am, she says.    How then shall my brother cease to be angry with me? Bring him to me and  I will tell him. But I have nothing to say to you about his anger.    When the man who was consulting him said, I seek to know this, How, even  if my brother is not reconciled to me, shall I maintain myself in a  state conformable to nature? Nothing great, said Epictetus, is produced  suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you say to me now  that you want a fig, I will answer to you that it requires time: let it  flower first, then put forth fruit, and then ripen. Is then the fruit of  a fig-tree not perfected suddenly and in one hour, and would you possess  the fruit of a man's mind in so short a time and so easily? Do not  expect it, even if I tell you.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH THE ERRORS (FAULTS) OF OTHERS.--Ought  not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroyed? By no means say  so, but speak rather in this way: This man who has been mistaken and  deceived about the most important things, and blinded, not in the  faculty of vision which distinguishes white and black, but in the  faculty which distinguishes good and bad, should we not destroy him? If  you speak thus you will see how inhuman this is which you say, and that  it is just as if you would say, Ought we not to destroy this blind and  deaf man? But if the greatest harm is the privation of the greatest  things, and the greatest thing in every man is the will or choice such  as it ought to be, and a man is deprived of this will, why are you also  angry with him? Man, you ought not to be affected contrary to nature by  the bad things of another. Pity him rather; drop this readiness to be  offended and to hate, and these words which the many utter: \"These  accursed and odious fellows.\" How have you been made so wise at once?  and how are you so peevish? Why then are we angry? Is it because we  value so much the things of which these men rob us? Do not admire your  clothes, and then you will not be angry with the thief. Consider this  matter thus: you have fine clothes; your neighbor has not; you have a  window; you wish to air the clothes. The thief does not know wherein  man's good consists, but he thinks that it consist in having fine  clothes, the very thing which you also think. Must he not then come and  take them away? When you show a cake to greedy persons, and swallow it  all yourself, do you expect them not to snatch it from you? Do not  provoke them; do not have a window; do not air your clothes. I also  lately had an iron lamp placed by the side of my household gods; hearing  a noise at the door, I ran down, and found that the lamp had been  carried off. I reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done nothing  strange. What then? To-morrow, I said, you will find an earthen lamp;  for a man only loses that which he has. I have lost my garment. The  reason is that you had a garment. I have a pain in my head. Have you any  pain in your horns? Why then are you troubled? For we only lose those  things, we have only pains about those things, which we possess.    But the tyrant will chain--what? The leg. He will take away--what? The  neck. What then will he not chain and not take away? The will. This is  why the ancients taught the maxim, Know thyself. Therefore we ought to  exercise ourselves in small things, and beginning with them to proceed  to the greater. I have pain in the head. Do not say, Alas! I have pain  in the ear. Do not say alas! And I do not say that you are not allowed  to groan, but do not groan inwardly; and if your slave is slow in  bringing a bandage, do not cry out and torment yourself, and say, Every  body hates me; for who would not hate such a man?

And indeed well I might.    Yet, truly, all was safe ended now, and I utter thankful and with a mad  delight in the heart; so that I caught up Mirdath, and we danced very  slow and stately around the great hall, the while that Mistress Alison  whistled us a tune with her mouth, which she could very clever, as many  another thing, I wot.    And each day and all day after this Gladness, Mirdath and I could never  be apart; but must go a-wander always together, here and there, in an  unending joy of our togetherness.    And in a thousand things were we at one in delight; for we had both of  us that nature which doth love the blue of eternity which gathers beyond  the wings of the sunset; and the invisible sound of the starlight  falling upon the world; and the quiet of grey evenings when the Towers  of Sleep are builded unto the mystery of the Dusk; and the solemn green  of strange pastures in the moonlight; and the speech of the sycamore  unto the beech; and the slow way of the sea when it doth mood; and the  soft rustling of the night clouds. And likewise had we eyes to see the  Dancer of the Sunset, casting her mighty robes so strange; and ears to  know that there shakes a silent thunder over the Face of Dawn; and much  else that we knew and saw and understood together in our utter joy.    Now, there happened to us about this time a certain adventure that came  near to cause the death of Mirdath the Beautiful; for one day as we  wandered, as ever, like two children in our contentment, I made remark  to Mirdath that there went only two of the great boar-hounds with us;  and she then told me that the third was to the kennels, being sick.    Yet, scarce had she told me so much; ere she cried out something and  pointed; and lo! I saw that the third hound came towards us, at a run,  yet very strange-seeming in his going. And in a moment, Mirdath cried  out that the hound was mad; and truly, I saw then that the brute  slavered as he came running.    And in a moment he was upon us, and made never a sound; but leaped at me  in one instant of time; all before I had any thought of such intent. But  surely, My Beautiful One had a dreadful love for me, for she cast  herself at the dog, to save me, calling to the other hounds. And she was  bitten in a moment by the brute, as she strove to hold him off from me.  But I to have him instant by the neck and the body, and brake him, so  that he died at once; and I cast him to the earth, and gave help to  Mirdath, that I draw the poison from the wounds.    And this I did so well as I might, despite that she would have me stop.  And afterwards, I took her into mine arms, and ran very fierce all the  long and weary way to the Hall, and with hot skewers I burned the  wounds; so that when the doctor came, he to say I have saved her by my  care, if indeed she to be saved. But, truly, she had saved me in any  wise, as you shall think; so that I could never be done of honour to  her.    And she very pale; but yet to laugh at my fears, and to say that she  soon to have her health, and the wounds healed very speedy; but, indeed,  it was a long and bitter time before they were proper healed, and she so  well as ever. Yet, in time, so it was; and an utter weight off my heart.    And when Mirdath was grown full strong again, we set our wedding day.  And well do I mind how she stood there in her bridal dress, on that day,  so slender and lovely as may Love have stood in the Dawn of Life; and  the beauty of her eyes that had such sober sweetness in them, despite  the dear mischief of her nature; and the way of her little feet, and the  loveliness of her hair; and the dainty rogue-grace of her movements; and  her mouth an enticement, as that a child and a woman smiled out of the  one face. And this to be no more than but an hint of the loveliness of  My Beautiful One.    And so we were married.    Mirdath, My Beautiful One, lay dying, and I had no power to hold Death  backward from such dread intent. In another room, I heard the little  wail of the child; and the wail of the child waked my wife back into  this life, so that her hands fluttered white and desperately needful  upon the coverlid.    I kneeled beside My Beautiful One, and reached out and took her hands  very gentle into mine; but still they fluttered so needful; and she  looked at me, dumbly; but her eyes beseeching.    Then I went out of the room, and called gently to the Nurse; and the  Nurse brought in the child, wrapped very softly in a long, white robe.  And I saw the eyes of My Beautiful One grow clearer with a strange,  lovely light; and I beckoned to the Nurse to bring the babe near.    My wife moved her hands very weakly upon the coverlid, and I knew that  she craved to touch her child; and I signed to the Nurse, and took my  child in mine arms; and the Nurse went out from the room, and so we  three were alone together.    Then I sat very gentle upon the bed; and I held the babe near to My  Beautiful One, so that the wee cheek of the babe touched the white cheek  of my dying wife; but the weight of the child I kept off from her.    And presently, I knew that Mirdath, My Wife, strove dumbly to reach for  the hands of the babe; and I turned the child more towards her, and  slipped the hands of the child into the weak hands of My Beautiful One.  And I held the babe above my wife, with an utter care; so that the eyes  of my dying One, looked into the young eyes of the child. And presently,  in but a few moments of time; though it had been someways an eternity,  My Beautiful One closed her eyes and lay very quiet. And I took away the  child to the Nurse, who stood beyond the door. And I closed the door,  and came back to Mine Own, that we have those last instants alone  together.    And the hands of my wife lay very still and white; but presently they  began to move softly and weakly, searching for somewhat; and I put out  my great hands to her, and took her hands with an utter care; and so a  little time passed.    Then her eyes opened, quiet and grey, and a little dazed seeming; and  she rolled her head on the pillow and saw me; and the pain of  forgetfulness went out of her eyes, and she looked at me with a look  that grew in strength, unto a sweetness of tenderness and full  understanding.    And I bent a little to her; and her eyes told me to take her into mine  arms for those last minutes. Then I went very gentle upon the bed, and  lifted her with an utter and tender care, so that she lay suddenly  strangely restful against my breast; for Love gave me skill to hold her,  and Love gave My Beautiful One a sweetness of ease in that little time  that was left to us.    And so we twain were together; and Love seemed that it had made a truce  with Death in the air about us, that we be undisturbed; for there came a  drowse of rest even upon my tense heart, that had known nothing but a  dreadful pain through the weary hours.    And I whispered my love silently to My Beautiful One, and her eyes  answered; and the strangely beautiful and terrible moments passed by  into the hush of eternity.    And suddenly, Mirdath My Beautiful One, spoke,--whispering something.  And I stooped gently to hark; and Mine Own spoke again; and lo! it was  to call me by the olden Love Name that had been mine through all the  utter lovely months of our togetherness.    And I began again to tell her of my love, that should pass beyond death;  and lo! in that one moment of time, the light went out of her eyes; and  My Beautiful One lay dead in mine arms ... My Beautiful One....          II    THE LAST REDOUBT      Since Mirdath, My Beautiful One, died and left me lonely in this world,  I have suffered an anguish, and an utter and dreadful pain of longing,  such as truly no words shall ever tell; for, in truth, I that had all  the world through her sweet love and companionship, and knew all the joy  and gladness of Life, have known such lonesome misery as doth stun me to  think upon.    Yet am I to my pen again; for of late a wondrous hope has grown in me,  in that I have, at night in my sleep, waked into the future of this  world, and seen strange things and utter marvels, and known once more  the gladness of life; for I have learned the promise of the future, and  have visited in my dreams those places where in the womb of Time, she  and I shall come together, and part, and again come together--breaking  asunder most drearly in pain, and again reuniting after strange ages, in  a glad and mighty wonder.    And this is the utter strange story of that which I have seen, and  which, truly, I must set out, if the task be not too great; so that, in  the setting out thereof, I may gain a little ease of the heart; and  likewise, mayhap, give ease of hope to some other poor human, that doth  suffer, even as I have suffered so dreadful with longing for Mine Own  that is dead.    And some shall read and say that this thing was not, and some shall  dispute with them; but to them all I say naught, save \"Read!\" And having  read that which I set down, then shall one and all have looked towards  Eternity with me--unto its very portals. And so to my telling:    To me, in this last time of my visions, of which I would tell, it was  not as if I _dreamed_; but, as it were, that I _waked_ there into the  dark, _in the future of this world_. And the sun had died; and for me  thus newly waked into that Future, to look back upon this, our Present  Age, was to look back into dreams that my soul knew to be of reality;  but which to those newly-seeing eyes of mine, appeared but as a far  vision, strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light."]]]
