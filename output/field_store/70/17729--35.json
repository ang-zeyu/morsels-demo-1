It is as yet a mere sketch in manuscript, and to copy it would be a  difficult task even for the clever and practised Paraquin [counter-bass in  the Electoral orchestra]. You can have the Rondo copied, and return the  score. What I now send is the only one of my works at all suitable for you;  besides, as you are going to Kerpen [where an uncle of the family lived], I  thought these trifles might cause you pleasure.    Farewell, my friend; for it is impossible for me to give you any other  name. However indifferent I may be to you, believe me, I shall ever  continue to revere you and your mother as I have always done. If I can in  any way contribute to the fulfilment of a wish of yours, do not fail to let  me know, for I have no other means of testifying my gratitude for past  friendship.    I wish you an agreeable journey, and that your dear mother may return  entirely restored to health! Think sometimes of your affectionate friend,    BEETHOVEN.      6.    TO HERR SCHENK.    June, 1794.    DEAR SCHENK,[1]--    I did not know that I was to set off to-day to Eisenstadt. I should like to  have talked to you again. In the mean time rest assured of my gratitude for  your obliging services. I shall endeavor, so far as it lies in my power, to  requite them. I hope soon to see you, and once more to enjoy the pleasure  of your society. Farewell, and do not entirely forget your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Schenk, afterwards celebrated as the composer of the \"Dorf  Barbier,\" was for some time Beethoven's teacher in composition. This note  appears to have been written in June, 1794, and first printed in the  \"Freischuetz,\" No. 183, about 1836, at the time of Schenk's death, when his  connection with Beethoven was mentioned.]      7.    TO DR. WEGELER,--VIENNA.[1]    ... In what an odious light have you exhibited me to myself! Oh! I  acknowledge it, I do not deserve your friendship. It was no intentional or  deliberate malice that induced me to act towards you as I did, but  inexcusable thoughtlessness alone.    I say no more. I am coming to throw myself into your arms, and to entreat  you to restore me my lost friend; and you will give him back to me, to your  penitent, loving, and ever-grateful    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Dr. Wegeler, in answer to my request that he would send me the  entire letter, replied that \"the passages omitted in the letter consisted  chiefly in eulogiums of his father, and enthusiastic expressions of  friendship, which did not seem to him to be of any value; but besides this,  the same reasons that induced his father to give only a portion of the  letter were imperative with him also.\" I do not wish to contest the point  with the possessor of the letter; still I may remark that all the  utterances and letters of a great man belong to the world at large, and  that in a case like the present, the conscientious biographer, who strives  faithfully to portray such a man, is alone entitled to decide what portion  of these communications is fitted for publication, and what is not. Any  considerations of a personal character seem to me very trivial.]      8.    TO DR. WEGELER,--VIENNA.    Vienna, May 1797.    God speed you, my dear friend! I owe you a letter which you shall shortly  have, and my newest music besides, _I am going on well; indeed, I may say  every day better._ Greet those to whom it will give pleasure from me.  Farewell, and do not forget your    BEETHOVEN.      9.    WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF LENZ VON BREUNING.    Vienna, Oct. 1, 1797.      Truth for the wise,    Beauty for a feeling heart,    And both for each other.    MY DEAR, GOOD BREUNING,--    Never can I forget the time I passed with you, not only in Bonn, but here.  Continue your friendship towards me, for you shall always find me the same  true friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      10.    TO BARON ZMESKALL VON DOMANOWECZ.    1800.[1]    [Music: Alto, Tenor, Bass clefs, C Major, 4/4 time, Grave.  ALTO. Ba-ron.  TENORE. Ba-ron.  BASSO. Ba-ron. Ba-ron. Ba-ron.]    MY CHEAPEST (NOT DEAREST) BARON,--    Desire the guitar-player to come to me to-day. Amenda (instead of an  _amende_ [fine], which he sometimes deserves for not observing his rests  properly) must persuade this popular guitarist to visit me, and if possible  to come at five o'clock this evening; if not then, at five or six o'clock  to-morrow morning; but he must not waken me if I chance to be still asleep.  _Adieu, mon ami a bon marche._ Perhaps we may meet at the \"Swan\"?    [Footnote 1: As it appears from the following letters that Amenda was again  at home in 1800, the date of this note is thus ascertained. It is  undoubtedly addressed to Baron Zmeskall von Domanowecz, Royal Court  Secretary, a good violoncello-player, and one of Beethoven's earliest  friends in Vienna. The \"guitarist\" was probably the celebrated Giuliani,  who lived in Vienna.]      11.    The musical Count is from this day forth _cashiered_ with infamy. The first  violin [Schuppanzigh] ruthlessly transported to _Siberia_. The Baron [see  No. 10] for a whole month _strictly interdicted from asking questions_; no  longer to be so hasty, and to devote himself exclusively to his _ipse  miserum_.[1]    B.    [Footnote 1: Written in gigantic characters in pencil on a large sheet of  paper. The \"musical Count\" is probably Count Moritz Lichnowsky, brother of  Prince Carl Lichnowsky, in whose house were held those musical performances  in which Beethoven's works were first produced. Even at that time he  behaved in a very dictatorial manner to those gentlemen when his  compositions were badly executed. Thence the name given him by Haydn of  \"The Great Mogul.\"]      12.    TO PASTOR AMENDA,--COURLAND.    Does Amenda think that I can ever forget him, because I do not write? in  fact, never have written to him?--as if the memory of our friends could  only thus be preserved! The _best man I ever knew_ has a thousand times  recurred to my thoughts! Two persons alone once possessed my whole love,  one of whom still lives, and you are now the third. How can my remembrance  of you ever fade? You will shortly receive a long letter about my present  circumstances and all that can interest you. Farewell, beloved, good, and  noble friend! Ever continue your love and friendship towards me, just as I  shall ever be your faithful    BEETHOVEN.      13.    TO PASTOR AMENDA.    1800.    MY DEAR, MY GOOD AMENDA, MY WARM-HEARTED FRIEND,--    I received and read your last letter with deep emotion, and with mingled  pain and pleasure. To what can I compare your fidelity and devotion to me?  Ah! it is indeed delightful that you still continue to love me so well. I  know how to prize you, and to distinguish you from all others; you are not  like my Vienna friends. No! you are one of those whom the soil of my  fatherland is wont to bring forth; how often I wish that you were with me,  for your Beethoven is very unhappy. You must know that one of my most  precious faculties, that of hearing, is become very defective; even while  you were still with me I felt indications of this, though I said nothing;  but it is now much worse. Whether I shall ever be cured remains yet to be  seen; it is supposed to proceed from the state of my digestive organs, but  I am almost entirely recovered in that respect. I hope indeed that my  hearing may improve, but I scarcely think so, for attacks of this kind are  the most incurable of all. How sad my life must now be!--forced to shun all  that is most dear and precious to me, and to live with such miserable  egotists as ----, &c. I can with truth say that of all my friends  Lichnowsky [Prince Carl] is the most genuine. He last year settled 600  florins on me, which, together with the good sale of my works, enables me  to live free from care as to my maintenance. All that I now write I can  dispose of five times over, and be well paid into the bargain. I have been  writing a good deal latterly, and as I hear that you have ordered some  pianos from ----, I will send you some of my compositions in the  packing-case of one of these instruments, by which means they will not cost  you so much.    To my great comfort, a person has returned here with whom I can enjoy the  pleasures of society and disinterested friendship,--one of the friends of  my youth [Stephan von Breuning]. I have often spoken to him of you, and  told him that since I left my fatherland, you are one of those to whom my  heart specially clings. Z. [Zmeskall?] does not seem quite to please him;  he is, and always will be, too weak for true friendship, and I look on him  and ---- as mere instruments on which I play as I please, but never can  they bear noble testimony to my inner and outward energies, or feel true  sympathy with me; I value them only in so far as their services deserve.  Oh! how happy should I now be, had I my full sense of hearing; I would then  hasten to you; whereas, as it is, I must withdraw from everything. My best  years will thus pass away, without effecting what my talents and powers  might have enabled me to perform. How melancholy is the resignation in  which I must take refuge! I had determined to rise superior to all this,  but how is it possible? If in the course of six months my malady be  pronounced incurable then, Amenda! I shall appeal to you to leave all else  and come to me, when I intend to travel (my affliction is less distressing  when playing and composing, and most so in intercourse with others), and  you must be my companion. I have a conviction that good fortune will not  forsake me, for to what may I not at present aspire? Since you were here I  have written everything except operas and church music. You will not, I  know, refuse my petition; you will help your friend to bear his burden and  his calamity. I have also very much perfected my pianoforte playing, and I  hope that a journey of this kind may possibly contribute to your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#4)"],[1," guilty  either of treason or of misprison of treason, it was helped in that  respect by several other Acts; but the fullest of all was the Act made  in the reign of the late King William, and rendered perpetual by a  subsequent Law made in the reign of her late Majesty [Anne], whereby it  is enacted, that whoever shall make, mend, buy, sell, or have in his  possession, any mould or press for coining, or shall convey such  instruments out of the King's Mint, or mark on the edges of any coin  current or counterfeit, or any round blanks of base metal, or colour or  gild any coin resembling the coin of this kingdom, shall suffer death as  in case of high treason. At the time when these laws were made coining  and clipping were at a prodigious height, and practised not only by mean  and indigent persons but also by some of tolerable character and rank,  insomuch that these executions were numerous for some years after  passing the said Act, which as it created some new species of high  treason, so it also made felony some other offences against the coin  which were not so, or at least were not clearly so before, viz., to  blanch copper for sale; or to mix blanch copper with silver, or  knowingly or fraudulently to buy any mixture which shall be heavier than  silver, and look, touch, and wear like gold, but be manifestly worse; or  receive, or pay any counterfeit money at a lower rate than its  denomination doth import, shall be guilty of felony._    _A third head under which, in this cursory account of Crown Law, I shall  range other offences that are punished capitally, are those against our  fellow subjects, and they are either committed against their lives,  their goods or their habitations. With respect to those against life, if  one person kill another without any malice aforethought, then that  natural tenderness of which the Law of England is full, interposes for  the first fact, which in such a case is denominated manslaughter. Yet  there is a particular kind of manslaughter which, by the first of King  James, is made felony without benefit of clergy, and that is, where a  person shall stab or thrust any person or persons that have not any  weapon drawn (or that have not first struck the party which shall so  stab or thrust), so that the person or persons so stabbed or thrust  shall die within six months next following, though it cannot be proved  that the same was done of malice aforethought. This Act it is which is  commonly called the Statute of Stabbing._    _As to murder properly so called, and taking it as a term in the English  Law, it signifies the killing of any person whatsoever from malice  aforethought, whether the person slain be an Englishman or not, and this  may not only be done directly by a wound or blow, but also by  deliberately doing a thing which apparently endangers another's life, so  that if death follow thereon he shall be adjudged to have killed him.  Such was the case of him who carried his sick father from one town to  another against his will in a frosty season. It would be too long for  this Preface, should I endeavour to distinguish the several cases which  in the eye of the Law come under this denomination; having, therefore, a  view to the work itself, I shall distinguish two points only from which  malice prepense is presumed in Law._    _(1) Where an express purpose appears in him who kills, to do some  personal injury to him who is slain; in which case malice is properly to  be expressed._    _(2) Where a person in the execution of an unlawful action kills  another, though his principal intent was not to do any personal injury  to the person slain; in which case the malice is said to be implied._    _As to duels where the blood has once cooled, there is no doubt but he  who kills another is guilty of wilful murder; or even in case of a  sudden quarrel, if the person killing appear by any circumstance to be  master of his temper at the time he slew the other, then it will be  murder. Not that the English Law allows nothing to the frailties of  human nature, but that it always exerts itself where there appears to  have been a person killed in cool blood. Far this reason the seconds at  a premeditated duel have been held guilty of murder, nor will the  justice of the English Law be defeated where a person appears to have  intended a less hurt than death, if that hurt arose from a desire of  revenge in cool blood; for if the person dies of the injury it will be  murder. So, also, where the revenge of a sudden provocation is executed  in a cruel manner, though without intention of death, yet if it happen,  it is murder._    _We come now to those kinds of killing in which the Law, from the second  method of reasoning we have spoken of, implies malice, and into which  slaying of others, those unfortunate persons of whom we speak in the  following sheets were mostly led either through the violence of their  passions, or through the necessity into which they are often drawn by  the commission of thefts and other crimes. Thus, were a person to kill  another in doing a felony, though it be by accident, or where a person  fires at one who resists his robbing him and by such firing kills  another against whom he had no design, yet from the evil intention of  the first act, he becomes liable for all its consequences, and the fact,  by an implication of malice, will be adjudged murder. Nay, though there  be no design of committing felony, but only of breaking the peace, yet  if a man be slain in the tumult they will all be guilty of murder,  because their first act was a deliberate breach of the Law. There is yet  another manner of killing which the Law punishes with the utmost  severity, which is resisting an officer, civil or criminal, in the  execution of his office (arresting a person) so that he be slain, yet  though he did not produce his warrant, the offence will be adjudged  murder. And if persons who design no mischief at all, do unadvisedly  commit any idle wanton act which cannot but be attended with manifest  danger, such as riding with a horse known to kick amongst a crowd of  people, merely to divert oneself by putting them in a fright, and by  such riding a death ensues, there such a person will be judged guilty of  murder. Yet some offences there are of so transcendent a cruelty that  the Law hath thought fit to difference them from the other murders, and  these are of three sorts, viz., where a servant kills his master; where  a wife kills her husband; where an ecclesiastical man kills his prelate  to whom he owes obedience. In all these cases the Law makes the crimes  Petit Treason._    _From crimes committed against the lives of men we descend next to  offences against their goods, in which, that we may be the more clearly  understood, we shall begin with the lowest kind of thefts. The Law calls  it larceny where there is felonious and fraudulent taking and carrying  away the mere personal goods of another, so long as it be neither from  his person nor out of his house. If the value of such goods be under  twelvepence, then it is called petty larceny, and is punishable only by  whipping or other corporal punishments; but if they exceed that value,  then it is grand larceny, and is punishable with death, where benefit of  clergy is not allowed._    _There are a multitude of offences contained under the general title of  grand larceny, and, therefore, as I intend only to give my readers such  a general idea of Crown Law as may serve to render the following pages  more intelligible, so I shall dwell on such particulars as are more  especially useful in that respect, and leave the perfect knowledge of  the pleas of the Crown to be attained by the study of the several books  which treat of them directly and fully. There was until the reign of  King William, a doubt whether a lodger who stole the furniture of his  lodgings were indictable as a felon, inasmuch as he had a special  property in the goods, and was to pay the greater rent in consideration  of them. To clear this, a Statute was made in the afore-mentioned reign,  by which it is declared larceny and felony for any person to steal,  embezzle, or purloin any chattel or furniture which by contract he was  to have the use of in lodging; and by a Statute made in the reign of  Henry VIII, it is enacted that all servants being of the age of eighteen  years, and not apprentices, to whom goods and chattels shall be  delivered by their masters or mistresses for them to keep, if they shall  go away with, or shall defraud or embezzle any part of such goods or  chattels, to the value of forty shillings or upwards, then such false  and fraudulent act be deemed and adjudged felony._    _But besides simple larceny, which is divided into grand and petty,  there is a mixed larceny which has a greater degree of guilt in it, as  being a taking from the person of a man or from his house. Larceny from  the person of a man either puts him in fear, and then it is a robbery,  or does not put him in fear, and then it is a larceny from the person,  and of this we shall speak first. It is either committed without a man's  knowledge, and in such a case it is excluded from benefit of clergy, or  it is openly done before the person's face, and then it is within the  benefit of clergy, unless it be in a dwelling-house and to the value of  forty shillings, in which case benefit is taken away by an Act made in  the reign of the late Queen. Larceny from the house is at this day in  several cases excluded from benefit of clergy, but in others it is  allowed._    _Robbery is the taking away violently and feloniously the goods or money  from the person of a man, putting him in fear; and this taking is not  only with the robber's own hands, but if he compel, by the terror of his  assault, the person whom he robs to give it himself, or bind him by such  terrible oaths, that afterwards in conscience he thinks himself obliged  to give it, is a taking"]]]
