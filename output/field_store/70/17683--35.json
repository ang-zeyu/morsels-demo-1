[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#4)"],[1,"are Johann Wier,  Friedrich Spee, and notably Reginald Scot, who in his _Discovery of  Witchcraft_, in 1584, undertook to prove that \"the contracts and  compacts of witches with devils and all infernal spirits and familiars,  are but erroneous novelties and erroneous conceptions.\"    \"After all it is setting a high value on our conjectures to roast a man  alive on account of them.\" (MONTAIGNE.)    Who may measure in romance and the drama the presence, the cogent and  undeniable power of those same abiding elements of mysticism and  mystery, which underlie all human experience, and repeated in myriad  forms find their classic expression in the queries of the \"Weird  Sisters,\" \"_those elemental avengers without sex or kin_\"?      \"When shall we three meet again,    In thunder, lightning or in rain?    When the hurly burly's done,    When the battle's lost and won.\"    Are not the mummeries of the witches about the cauldron in Macbeth, and  Talbot's threat pour la Pucelle,      \"Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,\"    uttered so long ago, echoed in the wailing cry of La Meffraye in the  forests of Machecoul, in the maledictions of Grio, and of the Saga of  the Burning Fields?    Their vitality is also clearly shown in their constant use and  exemplification by the romance and novel writers who appeal with  certainty and success to the popular taste in the tales of spectral  terrors. Witness: Farjeon's _The Turn of the Screw_; Bierce's _The  Damned Thing_; Bulwer's _A Strange Story_; Cranford's _Witch of Prague_;  Howells' _The Shadow of a Dream_; Winthrop's _Cecil Dreeme_; Grusot's  _Night Side of Nature_; Crockett's Black Douglas; and _The Red Axe_,  Francis' _Lychgate Hall_; Caine's _The Shadow of a Crime_; and countless  other stories, traditions, tales, and legends, written and unwritten,  that invite and receive a gracious hospitality on every hand.          CHAPTER III    \"A belief in witchcraft had always existed; it was entertained by Coke,  Bacon, Hale and even Blackstone. It was a misdemeanor at English common  law and made a felony without benefit of clergy by 33 Henry VIII, c. 8,  and 5 Eliz., c. 16, and the more severe statute of I Jas. 1, ch. 12.\"  _Connecticut--Origin of her Courts and Laws_ (N.E. States, Vol I,  p. 487-488), HAMERSLEY.    \"Selden took up a somewhat peculiar and characteristic position. He  maintained that the law condemning women to death for witchcraft was  perfectly just, but that it was quite unnecessary to ascertain whether  witchcraft was a possibility. A woman might not be able to destroy the  life of her neighbor by her incantations; but if she intended to do so,  it was right that she should be hung.\" _Rationalism in Europe_ (Vol. 1,  p. 123) LECKY.      The fundamental authority for legislation, for the decrees of courts and  councils as to witchcraft, from the days of the Witch of Endor to those  of Mercy Disborough of Fairfield, and Giles Corey of Salem Farms, was  the code of the Hebrews and its recognition in the Gospel dispensations.  Thereon rest most of the historic precedents, legislative,  ecclesiastical, and judicial.    \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Exodus xxii, 18.    What law embalmed in ancientry and honored as of divine origin has been  more fruitful of sacrifice and suffering? Through the Scriptures,  gathering potency as it goes, runs the same grim decree, with widening  definitions.    \"And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits and  after wizards ... I will even set my face against that soul and will cut  him off from among his people.\" Deuteronomy xviii, 10-11.    \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his  daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an  observer of times, or an enchanter, or a consulter with familiar  spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\" Deuteronomy xviii, 10-11.    \"Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards out  of the land.\" Samuel i, 3.    \"Now Saul the king of the Hebrews, had cast out of the country the  fortune tellers, and the necromancers, and all such as exercised the  like arts, excepting the prophets.... Yet did he bid his servants to  inquire out for him some woman that was a necromancer, and called up the  souls of the dead, that so he might know whether his affairs would  succeed to his mind; for this sort of necromantic women that bring up  the souls of the dead, do by them foretell future events.\" Josephus,  Book 6, ch. 14.    \"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.\" Samuel i, 15-23.    \"And I will cut off witchcraft out of the land.\" Micah v. 12.    \"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together  and burned them.\" Acts xix, 19.    \"But there was a certain man called Simon which beforetime in the same  city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria.\" Acts viii, 9.    \"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is  withered, and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are  burned.\"[C] John xv, 6.    [Footnote C: In the opinion of the eminent Italian jurist Bartolo,  witches were burned alive in early times on this authority.]    These citations make clear the scriptural recognition of witchcraft as a  heinous sin and crime. It is, however, necessary to draw a broad line of  demarcation between the ancient forms and manifestations which have been  brought into view for an illustrative purpose, and that delusion or  mania which centered in the theologic belief and teaching that Satan was  the arch enemy of mankind, and clothed with such power over the souls of  men as to make compacts with them, and to hold supremacy over them in  the warfare between good and evil.    The church from its earliest history looked upon witchcraft as a deadly  sin, and disbelief in it as a heresy, and set its machinery in motion  for its extirpation. Its authority was the word of God and the civil  law, and it claimed jurisdiction through the ecclesiastical courts, the  secular courts, however, acting as the executive of their decrees and  sentences.    Such was the cardinal principle which governed in the merciless attempts  to suppress the epidemic in spreading from the continent to England and  Scotland, and at last to the Puritan colonies in America, where the last  chapter of its history was written.    There can be no better, no more comprehensive modern definition of the  crime once a heresy, or of the popular conception of it, than the one  set forth in the New England indictments, to wit: \"interteining  familiarity with Satan the enemy of mankind, and by his help doing  works above the course of nature.\"    In few words Henry Charles Lea, in his _History of the Inquisition in  the Middle Ages_, analyzes the development of the Satanic doctrine from  a superstition into its acceptance as a dogma of Christian belief.    \"As Satan's principal object in his warfare with God was to seduce human  souls from their divine allegiance, he was ever ready with whatever  temptation seemed most likely to effect his purpose. Some were to be won  by physical indulgence; others by conferring on them powers enabling  them apparently to forecast the future, to discover hidden things, to  gratify enmity, and to acquire wealth, whether through forbidden arts or  by the services of a familiar demon subject to their orders. As the  neophyte in receiving baptism renounced the devil, his pomps and his  angels, it was necessary for the Christian who desired the aid of Satan  to renounce God. Moreover, as Satan when he tempted Christ offered him  the kingdoms of the earth in return for adoration--'If thou therefore  wilt worship me all shall be thine' (Luke iv, 7)--there naturally arose  the idea that to obtain this aid it was necessary to render allegiance  to the prince of hell. Thence came the idea, so fruitful in the  development of sorcery, of compacts with Satan by which sorcerers became  his slaves, binding themselves to do all the evil they could to follow  their example. Thus the sorcerer or witch was an enemy of all the human  race as well as of God, the most efficient agent of hell in its  sempiternal conflict with heaven. His destruction, by any method, was  therefore the plainest duty of man.    \"This was the perfected theory of sorcery and witchcraft by which the  gentle superstitions inherited and adopted from all sides were fitted  into the Christian dispensation and formed part of its accepted creed.\"  (_History of Inquisition in the Middle Ages_, 3, 385, LEA.)    Once the widespread superstition became adapted to the forms of  religious faith and discipline, and \"the prince of the power of the air\"  was clothed with new energies, the Devil was taken broader account of by  Christianity itself; the sorcery of the ancients was embodied in the  Christian conception of witchcraft; and the church undertook to deal  with it as a heresy; the door was opened wide to the sweep of the  epidemic in some of the continental lands.    In Bamburg and Wurzburg, Geneva and Como, Toulouse and Lorraine, and in  many other places in Italy, Germany, and France, thousands were  sacrificed in the names of religion, justice, and law, with bigotry for  their advocate, ignorance for their judge, and fanaticism for their  executioner. The storm of demonism raged through three centuries, and  was stayed only by the mighty barriers of protest, of inquiry, of  remonstrance, and the forces that crystallize and mold public opinion,  which guides the destinies of men in their march to a higher  civilization.    The flames burning so long and so fiercely on the continent at first  spread slowly in England and Scotland. Sorcery in some of its guises had  obtained therein ever since the Conquest, and victims had been burned  under the king's writ after sentence in the ecclesiastical courts; but  witchcraft as a compact with Satan was not made a felony until 1541, by  a statute of Henry VIII."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#4)"],[1,"of actual experience of this kind, and of the introduction  of such books as the \"Receipts for Dutch Victual\" and \"Epulario, or  the Italian Banquet,\" to English readers and students, is manifest  enough; for in the latter volume we get such entries as these: \"To  make a Portugal dish;\" \"To make a Virginia dish;\" \"A Persian dish;\" \"A  Spanish olio;\" and then there are receipts \"To make a Posset the  Earl of Arundel's way;\" \"To make the Lady Abergavenny's Cheese;\"  \"The Jacobin's Pottage;\" \"To make Mrs. Leeds' Cheesecakes;\" \"The Lord  Conway His Lordship's receipt for the making of Amber Puddings;\" \"The  Countess of Rutland's receipt of making the Rare Banbury Cake, which  was so much praised as her daughter's (the Right Honourable Lady  Chaworth) Pudding,\" and \"To make Poor Knights\"--the last a medley in  which bread, cream, and eggs were the leading materials.    Warner, however, in the \"Additional Notes and Observations\" to his  \"Antiquitates Culinariae,\" 1791, expresses himself adversely to  the foreign systems of cookery from an English point of view.  \"Notwithstanding,\" he remarks, \"the partiality of our countrymen  to French cookery, yet that mode of disguising meat in this kingdom  (except perhaps in the hottest part of the hottest season of the year)  is an absurdity. It is _here_ the art of _spoiling good meat_. The  same art, indeed, in the South of France; where the climate is much  warmer, and the flesh of the animal lean and insipid, is highly  valuable; it is the art of making _bad meat eatable_.\" At the same  time, he acknowledges the superior thrift and intelligence of the  French cooks, and instances the frog and the horse. \"The frog is  considered in this country as a disgusting animal, altogether unfit  for the purposes of the kitchen; whereas, by the efforts of French  cookery, the thighs of this little creature are converted into a  delicate and estimable dish.\" So sings, too (save the mark!), _our_  Charles Lamb, so far back as 1822, after his visit to Paris. It  seems that in Elizabeth's reign a _powdered_, or pickled horse was  considered a suitable dish by a French general entertaining at dinner  some English officers.    It is difficult to avoid an impression that Warner has some reason,  when he suggests that the immoderate use of condiments was brought  to us by the dwellers under a higher temperature, and was not really  demanded in such a climate as that of England, where meat can be  kept sweet in ordinary seasons, much longer even than in France or in  Italy. But let us bear in mind, too, how different from our own the  old English _cuisine_ was, and how many strange beasts calling for  lubricants it comprehended within its range.    An edifying insight into the old Scottish _cuisine_ among people of  the better sort is afforded by Fynes Morisoh, in his description of a  stay at a knight's house in North Britain in 1598.    \"Myself,\" he says, \"was at a knight's house, who had many servants  to attend him, that brought in his meat with their heads covered  with blue caps, the table being more than half furnished with great  platters of porridge, each having a little piece of sodden meat; and  when the tables were served, the servants did sit down with us; but  the upper mess, instead of porridge, had a pullet with some prunes in  the broth. And I observed no art of cookery, or furniture of  household stuff, but rather rude neglect of both, though myself and  my companion, sent by the Governor of Berwick upon bordering affairs,  were entertained in the best manner. The Scots ... vulgarly eat  hearth-cakes of oats, but in cities have also wheaten bread, which,  for the most part, was bought by courtiers, gentlemen, and the best  sort of citizens. When I lived at Berwick, the Scots weekly upon the  market day _obtained leave in writing of the governor_ to buy peas and  beans, whereof, as also of wheat, their merchants to this day (1617)  send great quantities from London into Scotland. They drink pure wine,  not with sugar, as the English, yet at feasts they put comfits in the  wine, after the French manner: but they had not our vintners' fraud to  mix their wines.\"    He proceeds to say that he noticed no regular inns, with signs hanging  out, but that private householders would entertain passengers on  entreaty, or where acquaintance was claimed. The last statement is  interestingly corroborated by the account which Taylor the Water-Poet  printed in 1618 of his journey to Scotland, and which he termed his  \"Penniless Pilgrimage or Moneyless Perambulation,\" in the course of  which he purports to have depended entirely on private hospitality.    A friend says: \"The Scotch were long very poor. Only their fish,  oatmeal, and whiskey kept them alive. Fish was very cheap.\" This  remark sounds the key-note of a great English want--cheaper fish.  Of meat we already eat enough, or too much; but of fish we might eat  more, if it could be brought at a low price to our doors. It is a  noteworthy collateral fact that in the Lord Mayor of London's Pageant  of 1590 there is a representation of the double advantage which would  accrue if the unemployed poor were engaged to facilitate and cheapen  the supply of fish to the City; and here we are, three centuries  forward, with the want still very imperfectly answered.    Besides the bread and oatmeal above named, the bannock played its  part. \"The Land o' Cakes\" was more than a trim and pretty phrase:  there was in it a deep eloquence; it marked a wide national demand and  supply.    The \"Penny Magazine\" for 1842 has a good and suggestive paper on  \"Feasts and Entertainments,\" with extracts from some of the early  dramatists and a woodcut of \"a new French cook, to devise fine  kickshaws and toys.\" One curious point is brought out here in the  phrase \"boiled _jiggets_ of mutton,\" which shews that the French  _gigot_ for a leg of mutton was formerly in use here. Like many other  Gallicisms, it lingered in Scotland down to our own time.    The cut of the French cook above mentioned is a modern composition;  and indeed some of the excerpts from Ben Jonson and other writers are  of an extravagant and hyperbolical cast,--better calculated to amuse  an audience than to instruct the student.    Mr. Lucas remarks: \"It is probable that we are more dependent upon  animal food than we used to be. In their early days, the present  generation of dalesmen fed almost exclusively upon oatmeal; either as  'hasty-pudding,'--that is, Scotch oatmeal which had been _ground over  again_, so as to be nearly as fine as flour;... or 'lumpy,'--that is,  boiled quickly and not thoroughly stirred; or else in one of the  three kinds of cake which they call 'fermented,' viz., 'riddle cake,'  'held-on cake,' or 'turn-down cake,' which is made from oatcake batter  poured on the 'bak' ston'' from the ladle, and then spread with the  back of the ladle. It does not rise like an oatcake. Or of a fourth  kind called 'clap cake.' They also made 'tiffany cakes' of wheaten  flour, which was separated from the bran by being worked through a  hair-sieve _tiffany_, or _temse_:--south of England _Tammy_,--with a  brush called the _Brush shank_.\"          ROYAL FEASTS AND SAVAGE POMP.      In Rose's \"School of Instructions for the Officers of the Mouth,\"  1682, the staff of a great French establishment is described as a  Master of the Household, a Master Carver, a Master Butler, a Master  Confectioner, a Master Cook, and a Master Pastryman. The author, who  was himself one of the cooks in our royal kitchen, tells Sir Stephen  Fox, to whom he dedicates his book, that he had entered on it after  he had completed one of a very different nature: \"The Theatre of the  World, or a Prospect of Human Misery.\"    At the time that the \"School of Instructions\" was written, the French  and ourselves had both progressed very greatly in the Art of Cookery  and in the development of the _menu_. DelaHay Street, Westminster,  near Bird-Cage Walk, suggests a time when a hedge ran along the  western side of it towards the Park, in lieu of brick or stone walls;  but the fact is that we have here a curious association with the  office, just quoted from Rose, of Master Confectioner. For of the plot  of ground on which the street, or at any rate a portion of it stands,  the old proprieter was Peter DelaHaye, master confectioner of Charles  II. at the very period of the publication of Rose's book. His name  occurs in the title-deeds of one of the houses on the Park side, which  since his day has had only five owners, and has been, since 1840, the  freehold of an old and valued friend of the present writer.    It may be worth pointing out, that the Confectionery and Pastry were  two distinct departments, each with its superintendent and staff. The  fondness for confections had spread from Italy--which itself in turn  borrowed the taste from the East--to France and England; and, as we  perceive from the descriptions furnished in books, these were often of  a very elaborate and costly character.    The volume is of the less interest for us, as it is a translation from  the French, and consequently does not throw a direct light on our own  kitchens at this period. But of course collaterally it presents  many features of likeness and analogy, and may be compared with  Braithwaite's earlier view to which I shall presently advert.    The following anecdote is given in the Epistle to Fox: \"Many do  believe the French way of working is cheapest; but let these examine  this book, and then they may see (for their satisfaction) which is the  best husbandry, to extract gold out of herbs, or to make a pottage of  a stone, by the example of two soldiers, who in their quarters were  minded to have a pottage; the first of them coming into a house and  asking for all things necessary to the making of one, was as soon told  that he could have none of these things there, whereupon he went away,  and the other coming in with a stone "]]]
