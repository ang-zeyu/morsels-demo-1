[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#4)"],[1,"on the  previous nights; but at length, using ourselves to it, we resumed our  smoking, and bade George to read out to us from the writing upon the  paper wrappers.    Then George, though shaking somewhat in his voice, began to decipher that  which was upon the wrappers, and a strange and awesome story it was, and  bearing much upon our own concerns:--    \"Now, when they discovered the spring among the trees that crown the  bank, there was much rejoicing; for we had come to have much need of  water. And some, being in fear of the ship (declaring, because of all our  misfortune and the strange disappearances of their messmates and the  brother of my lover, that she was haunted by a devil), declared their  intention of taking their gear up to the spring, and there making a camp.  This they conceived and carried out in the space of one afternoon; though  our Captain, a good and true man, begged of them, as they valued life, to  stay within the shelter of their living-place. Yet, as I have remarked,  they would none of them hark to his counseling, and, because the Mate  and the bo'sun were gone he had no means of compelling them to wisdom--\"    At this point, George ceased to read, and began to rustle among the  wrappers, as though in search for the continuation of the story.    Presently he cried out that he could not find it, and dismay was  upon his face.    But the bo'sun told him to read on from such sheets as were left; for, as  he observed, we had no knowledge if more existed; and we were fain to  know further of that spring, which, from the story, appeared to be over  the bank near to the vessel.    George, being thus adjured, picked up the topmost sheet; for they were,  as I heard him explain to the bo'sun, all oddly numbered, and having but  little reference one to the other. Yet we were mightily keen to know even  so much as such odd scraps might tell unto us. Whereupon, George read  from the next wrapper, which ran thus:--    \"Now, suddenly, I heard the Captain cry out that there was something in  the main cabin, and immediately my lover's voice calling to me to lock my  door, and on no condition to open it. Then the door of the Captain's  cabin slammed, and there came a silence, and the silence was broken by a  _sound_. Now, this was the first time that I had heard the Thing make  search through the big cabin; but, afterwards, my lover told me it had  happened aforetime, and they had told me naught, fearing to frighten me  needlessly; though now I understood why my lover had bidden me never to  leave my stateroom door unbolted in the nighttime. I remember also,  wondering if the noise of breaking glass that had waked me somewhat from  my dreams a night or two previously, had been the work of this  indescribable Thing; for on the morning following that night, the glass  in the skylight had been smashed. Thus it was that my thoughts wandered  out to trifles, while yet my soul seemed ready to leap out from my bosom  with fright.    \"I had, by reason of usage, come to ability to sleep despite of the  fearsome growling; for I had conceived its cause to be the mutter of  spirits in the night, and had not allowed myself to be unnecessarily  frightened with doleful thoughts; for my lover had assured me of our  safety, and that we should yet come to our home. And now, beyond my door,  I could hear that fearsome sound of the Thing searching--\"    George came to a sudden pause; for the bo'sun had risen and put a great  hand upon his shoulder. The lad made to speak; but the bo'sun beckoned to  him to say no word, and at that we, who had grown to nervousness through  the happenings in the story, began every one to listen. Thus we heard a  sound which had escaped us in the noise of the growling without the  vessel, and the interest of the reading.    For a space we kept very silent, no man doing more than let the breath go  in and out of his body, and so each one of us knew that something moved  without, in the big cabin. In a little, something touched upon our door,  and it was, as I have mentioned earlier, as though a great swab rubbed  and scrubbed at the woodwork. At this, the men nearest unto the door came  backwards in a surge, being put in sudden fear by reason of the Thing  being so near; but the bo'sun held up a hand, bidding them, in a low  voice, to make no unneedful noise. Yet, as though the sounds of their  moving had been heard, the door was shaken with such violence that we  waited, everyone, expecting to see it torn from its hinges; but it stood,  and we hasted to brace it by means of the bunk boards, which we placed  between it and the two great chests, and upon these we set a third chest,  so that the door was quite hid.    Now, I have no remembrance whether I have put down that when we came  first to the ship, we had found the stern window upon the larboard side  to be shattered; but so it was, and the bo'sun had closed it by means of  a teak-wood cover which was made to go over it in stormy weather, with  stout battens across, which were set tight with wedges. This he had done  upon the first night, having fear that some evil thing might come upon us  through the opening, and very prudent was this same action of his, as  shall be seen. Then George cried out that something was at the cover of  the larboard window, and we stood back, growing ever more fearful because  that some evil creature was so eager to come at us. But the bo'sun, who  was a very courageous man, and calm withal, walked over to the closed  window, and saw to it that the battens were secure; for he had knowledge  sufficient to be sure, if this were so, that no creature with strength  less than that of a whale could break it down, and in such case its bulk  would assure us from being molested.    Then, even as he made sure of the fastenings, there came a cry of fear  from some of the men; for there had come at the glass of the unbroken  window, a reddish mass, which plunged up against it, sucking upon it,  as it were. Then Josh, who was nearest to the table, caught up the  candle, and held it towards the Thing; thus I saw that it had the  appearance of a many-flapped thing shaped as it might be, out of raw  beef--_but it was alive_.    At this, we stared, everyone being too bemused with terror to do aught  to protect ourselves, even had we been possessed of weapons. And as we  remained thus, an instant, like silly sheep awaiting the butcher, I  heard the framework creak and crack, and there ran splits all across the  glass. In another moment, the whole thing would have been torn away, and  the cabin undefended, but that the bo'sun, with a great curse at us for  our landlubberly lack of use, seized the other cover, and clapped it  over the window. At that, there was more help than could be made to  avail, and the battens and wedges were in place in a trice. That this  was no sooner accomplished than need be, we had immediate proof; for  there came a rending of wood and a splintering of glass, and after that  a strange yowling out in the dark, and the yowling rose above and  drowned the continuous growling that filled the night. In a little, it  died away, and in the brief silence that seemed to ensue, we heard a  slobby fumbling at the teak cover; but it was well secured, and we had  no immediate cause for fear.          IV    The Two Faces      Of the remainder of that night, I have but a confused memory. At times we  heard the door shaken behind the great chests; but no harm came to it.  And, odd whiles, there was a soft thudding and rubbing upon the decks  over our heads, and once, as I recollect, the Thing made a final try at  the teak covers across the windows; but the day came at last, and found  me sleeping. Indeed, we had slept beyond the noon, but that the bo'sun,  mindful of our needs, waked us, and we removed the chests. Yet, for  perhaps the space of a minute, none durst open the door, until the bo'sun  bid us stand to one side. We faced about at him then, and saw that he  held a great cutlass in his right hand.    He called to us that there were four more of the weapons, and made a  backward motion with his left hand towards an open locker. At that, as  might be supposed, we made some haste to the place to which he pointed,  and found that, among some other gear, there were three more weapons such  as he held; but the fourth was a straight cut-and-thrust, and this I had  the good fortune to secure.    Being now armed, we ran to join the bo'sun; for by this he had the door  open, and was scanning the main cabin. I would remark here how a good  weapon doth seem to put heart into a man; for I, who but a few, short  hours since had feared for my life, was now right full of lustiness and  fight; which, mayhap, was no matter for regret.    From the main cabin, the bo'sun led up on to the deck, and I remember  some surprise at finding the lid of the scuttle even as we had left it  the previous night; but then I recollected that the skylight was broken,  and there was access to the big cabin that way. Yet, I questioned within  myself as to what manner of thing it could be which ignored the  convenience of the scuttle, and descended by way of the broken skylight.    We made a search of the decks and fo'cas'le, but found nothing, and,  after that, the bo'sun stationed two of us on guard, whilst the rest went  about such duties as were needful. In a little, we came to breakfast,  and, after that, we prepared to test the story upon the sample wrappers  and see perchance whether there was indeed a spring of fresh water among  the trees.    Now between the vessel and the trees, lay a slope of the thick mud,  against which the vessel rested. To have scrambled up this bank had been  next to impossible, by reason of its fat richness; for, indeed, it looked  fit to crawl; but that Josh called out to the bo'sun that he had come  upon a ladder, lashed across the fo'cas'le head. This was brought, also  several hatch covers. The latter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#4)"],[1,"to stay with  some people in the country. Besides, you don't know.\"    \"Don't know what?\"    \"That this idea of Jeeves's won't work. I feel a most frightful chump  now, yes, but who can say whether that will not pass off when I get into  a mob of other people in fancy dress. I had the same experience as a  child, one year during the Christmas festivities. They dressed me up as a  rabbit, and the shame was indescribable. Yet when I got to the party and  found myself surrounded by scores of other children, many in costumes  even ghastlier than my own, I perked up amazingly, joined freely in the  revels, and was able to eat so hearty a supper that I was sick twice in  the cab coming home. What I mean is, you can't tell in cold blood.\"    I weighed this. It was specious, of course.    \"And you can't get away from it that, fundamentally, Jeeves's idea is  sound. In a striking costume like Mephistopheles, I might quite easily  pull off something pretty impressive. Colour does make a difference. Look  at newts. During the courting season the male newt is brilliantly  coloured. It helps him a lot.\"    \"But you aren't a male newt.\"    \"I wish I were. Do you know how a male newt proposes, Bertie? He just  stands in front of the female newt vibrating his tail and bending his  body in a semi-circle. I could do that on my head. No, you wouldn't find  me grousing if I were a male newt.\"    \"But if you were a male newt, Madeline Bassett wouldn't look at you. Not  with the eye of love, I mean.\"    \"She would, if she were a female newt.\"    \"But she isn't a female newt.\"    \"No, but suppose she was.\"    \"Well, if she was, you wouldn't be in love with her.\"    \"Yes, I would, if I were a male newt.\"    A slight throbbing about the temples told me that this discussion had  reached saturation point.    \"Well, anyway,\" I said, \"coming down to hard facts and cutting out all  this visionary stuff about vibrating tails and what not, the salient  point that emerges is that you are booked to appear at a fancy-dress  ball. And I tell you out of my riper knowledge of fancy-dress balls,  Gussie, that you won't enjoy yourself.\"    \"It isn't a question of enjoying yourself.\"    \"I wouldn't go.\"    \"I must go. I keep telling you she's off to the country tomorrow.\"    I gave it up.    \"So be it,\" I said. \"Have it your own way.... Yes, Jeeves?\"    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle's cab, sir.\"    \"Ah? The cab, eh?... Your cab, Gussie.\"    \"Oh, the cab? Oh, right. Of course, yes, rather.... Thanks, Jeeves ...  Well, so long, Bertie.\"    And giving me the sort of weak smile Roman gladiators used to give the  Emperor before entering the arena, Gussie trickled off. And I turned to  Jeeves. The moment had arrived for putting him in his place, and I was  all for it.    It was a little difficult to know how to begin, of course. I mean to say,  while firmly resolved to tick him off, I didn't want to gash his feelings  too deeply. Even when displaying the iron hand, we Woosters like to keep  the thing fairly matey.    However, on consideration, I saw that there was nothing to be gained by  trying to lead up to it gently. It is never any use beating about the b.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"may I speak frankly?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"What I have to say may wound you.\"    \"Not at all, sir.\"    \"Well, then, I have been having a chat with Mr. Fink-Nottle, and he has  been telling me about this Mephistopheles scheme of yours.\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"Now let me get it straight. If I follow your reasoning correctly, you  think that, stimulated by being upholstered throughout in scarlet tights,  Mr. Fink-Nottle, on encountering the adored object, will vibrate his tail  and generally let himself go with a whoop.\"    \"I am of opinion that he will lose much of his normal diffidence, sir.\"    \"I don't agree with you, Jeeves.\"    \"No, sir?\"    \"No. In fact, not to put too fine a point upon it, I consider that of all  the dashed silly, drivelling ideas I ever heard in my puff this is the  most blithering and futile. It won't work. Not a chance. All you have  done is to subject Mr. Fink-Nottle to the nameless horrors of a  fancy-dress ball for nothing. And this is not the first time this sort  of thing has happened. To be quite candid, Jeeves, I have frequently  noticed before now a tendency or disposition on your part to  become--what's the word?\"    \"I could not say, sir.\"    \"Eloquent? No, it's not eloquent. Elusive? No, it's not elusive. It's on  the tip of my tongue. Begins with an 'e' and means being a jolly sight  too clever.\"    \"Elaborate, sir?\"    \"That is the exact word I was after. Too elaborate, Jeeves--that is what  you are frequently prone to become. Your methods are not simple, not  straightforward. You cloud the issue with a lot of fancy stuff that is  not of the essence. All that Gussie needs is the elder-brotherly advice  of a seasoned man of the world. So what I suggest is that from now onward  you leave this case to me.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"You lay off and devote yourself to your duties about the home.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"I shall no doubt think of something quite simple and straightforward yet  perfectly effective ere long. I will make a point of seeing Gussie  tomorrow.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"Right ho, Jeeves.\"    But on the morrow all those telegrams started coming in, and I confess  that for twenty-four hours I didn't give the poor chap a thought, having  problems of my own to contend with.        -3-      The first of the telegrams arrived shortly after noon, and Jeeves brought  it in with the before-luncheon snifter. It was from my Aunt Dahlia,  operating from Market Snodsbury, a small town of sorts a mile or two  along the main road as you leave her country seat.    It ran as follows:    _Come at once. Travers._    And when I say it puzzled me like the dickens, I am understating it; if  anything. As mysterious a communication, I considered, as was ever  flashed over the wires. I studied it in a profound reverie for the best  part of two dry Martinis and a dividend. I read it backwards. I read it  forwards. As a matter of fact, I have a sort of recollection of even  smelling it. But it still baffled me.    Consider the facts, I mean. It was only a few hours since this aunt and I  had parted, after being in constant association for nearly two months.  And yet here she was--with my farewell kiss still lingering on her cheek,  so to speak--pleading for another reunion. Bertram Wooster is not  accustomed to this gluttonous appetite for his society. Ask anyone who  knows me, and they will tell you that after two months of my company,  what the normal person feels is that that will about do for the present.  Indeed, I have known people who couldn't stick it out for more than a few  days.    Before sitting down to the well-cooked, therefore, I sent this reply:    _Perplexed. Explain. Bertie._    To this I received an answer during the after-luncheon sleep:    _What on earth is there to be perplexed about, ass? Come at once.  Travers._    Three cigarettes and a couple of turns about the room, and I had my  response ready:    _How do you mean come at once? Regards. Bertie._    I append the comeback:    _I mean come at once, you maddening half-wit. What did you think I meant?  Come at once or expect an aunt's curse first post tomorrow. Love.  Travers._    I then dispatched the following message, wishing to get everything quite  clear:    _When you say \"Come\" do you mean \"Come to Brinkley Court\"? And when you  say \"At once\" do you mean \"At once\"? Fogged. At a loss. All the best.  Bertie._    I sent this one off on my way to the Drones, where I spent a restful  afternoon throwing cards into a top-hat with some of the better element.  Returning in the evening hush, I found the answer waiting for me:    _Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It doesn't matter whether you  understand or not. You just come at once, as I tell you, and for heaven's  sake stop this back-chat. Do you think I am made of money that I can  afford to send you telegrams every ten minutes. Stop being a fathead and  come immediately. Love. Travers._    It was at this point that I felt the need of getting a second opinion. I  pressed the bell.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"a V-shaped rumminess has manifested itself from the  direction of Worcestershire. Read these,\" I said, handing him the papers  in the case.    He scanned them.    \"What do you make of it, Jeeves?\"    \"I think Mrs. Travers wishes you to come at once, sir.\"    \"You gather that too, do you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I put the same construction on the thing. But why, Jeeves? Dash it all,  she's just had nearly two months of me.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And many people consider the medium dose for an adult two days.\"    \"Yes, sir. I appreciate the point you raise. Nevertheless, Mrs. Travers  appears very insistent. I think it would be well to acquiesce in her  wishes.\"    \"Pop down, you mean?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, I certainly can't go at once. I've an important conference on at  the Drones tonight. Pongo Twistleton's birthday party, you remember.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    There was a slight pause. We were both recalling the little  unpleasantness that had arisen. I felt obliged to allude to it.    \"You're all wrong about that mess jacket, Jeeves.\"    \"These things are matters of opinion, sir.\"    \"When I wore it at the Casino at Cannes, beautiful women nudged one  another and whispered: 'Who is he?'\"    \"The code at Continental casinos is notoriously lax, sir.\"    \"And when I described it to Pongo last night, he was fascinated.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"So were all the rest of those present. One and all admitted that I had  got hold of a good thing. Not a dissentient voice.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"I am convinced that you will eventually learn to love this mess-jacket,  Jeeves.\"    \"I fear not, sir.\"    I gave it up. It is never any use trying to reason with Jeeves on these  occasions. \"Pig-headed\" is the word that springs to the lips. One sighs  and passes"]]]
