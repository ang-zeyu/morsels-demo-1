The incident  of the oath extracted from everything on earth to protect Baldr, which  occurs in Snorri and in a paper MS. of _Baldr's Dreams_, was probably  invented to explain the choice of weapon, which would certainly need  explanation to an Icelandic audience. If Dr. Frazer's theory be right,  Vali, who slew the slayer, must also have been an original figure in  the legend. His antiquity is supported by the fact that he plays the  part of avenger in the poems; while in Snorri, where he is mentioned  as a God, his absence from the account of Baldr's death is only a  part of that literary development by which real responsibility for  the murder was transferred from Hoed to Loki.    Snorri gives Baldr a son, Forseti (Judge), who is also named as a  God in _Grimnismal_. He must have grown out of an epithet of Baldr's,  of whom Snorri says that \"no one can resist his sentence\"; the sacred  tree would naturally be the seat of judgment.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Wanes._--Three of the Norse divinities, Njoerd and his son and  daughter, are not Aesir by descent. The following account is given  of their presence in Asgard:    (1) In _Vafthrudnismal_, Odin asks:    \"Whence came Njoerd among the sons of the Aesir? for he was not born  of the Aesir.\"    _Vafthrudni_. \"In Vanaheim wise powers ordained and gave him for a  hostage to the Gods; at the doom of the world he shall come back,  home to the wise Wanes.\"    (2) There is an allusion in _Voeluspa_ to the war which caused the  giving of hostages:    \"Odin shot into the host: this was the first war in the world. Broken  was the wall of the citadel of the Aesir, so that the Wanes could  tread the fields of war.\"    (3) Loki taunts Njoerd with his position, in _Lokasenna_:    \"Thou wast sent from the east as a hostage to the Gods....\"    _Njoerd_. \"This is my comfort, though I was sent from far as a hostage  to the Gods, yet I have a son whom no one hates, and he is thought  the best of the Aesir.\"    _Loki_. \"Stay, Njoerd, restrain thy pride; I will hide it no longer:  thy son is thine own sister's son, and that is no worse than one  would expect.\"    _Tyr_. \"Frey is the best of all the bold riders of Asgard.\"    There is little doubt that Njoerd was once a God of higher importance  than he is in the Edda, where he is overshadowed by his son. Grimm's  suggestion that he and the goddess Nerthus, mentioned by Tacitus,  were brother and sister, is supported by the line in _Lokasenna_; it  is an isolated reference, and the Goddess has left no other traces in  Scandinavian mythology. They were the deities, probably agricultural,  of an earlier age, whose adoption by the later Northmen was explained  by the story of the compact between Aesir and Vanir. Then their places  were usurped by Frey and Freyja, who were possibly created out of  epithets originally applied to the older pair; Njoerd was retained  with lessened importance, Nerthus passed out altogether. The Edda  gives Njoerd a giant-bride, Skadi, who was admitted among the Gods in  atonement for the slaying of her father Thiazi; she is little more  than a name. Frey and Freyja have other marks of agricultural deities,  besides their relationship. Nothing is said about Frey's changing  shape, but Freyja possesses a hawk-dress which Loki borrows when  he wishes to change his form; and, according to Snorri, Frey was  sacrificed to for the crops. Njoerd has an epithet, \"the wealthy,\"  which may have survived from his earlier connexion with the soil. In  that case, it would explain why, in Snorri and elsewhere, he is God of  the sea and ships, once the province of the ocean-goddess Gefion; the  transference is a natural one to an age whose wealth came from the sea.    In spite of their origin, Frey and Freyja become to all intents  and purposes Aesir. Frey is to be one of the chief combatants at  Ragnaroek, with the fire-giant Surt for his antagonist, and a story is  told to explain his defeat: he fell in love with Gerd, a giant-maid,  and sacrificed his sword to get her; hence he is weaponless at the  last fight. Loki alludes to this episode in _Lokasenna_: \"With gold  didst thou buy Gymi's daughter, and gavest thy sword for her; but when  Muspell's sons ride over Myrkwood, thou shalt not know with what to  fight, unhappy one.\" The story is told in full in _Skirnisfoer_.    Freyja is called by Snorri \"the chief Goddess after Frigg,\" and the  two are sometimes confused. Like her father and brother, she comes into  connexion with the giants; she is the beautiful Goddess, and coveted by  them. _Voeluspa_ says that the Gods went into consultation to discuss  \"who had given the bride of Od (_i.e._, Freyja) to the giant race\";  _Thrymskvida_ relates how the giant Thrym bargained for Freyja as  the ransom for Thor's hammer, which he had hidden, and how Loki and  Thor outwitted him; and Snorri says the giants bargained for her as  the price for building Valhalla, but were outwitted. Sir G.W. Dasent  notices in the folk-tales the eagerness of trolls and giants to learn  the details of the agricultural processes, and this is probably the  clue to the desire of the Frost-Giants in the Edda for the possession  of Freyja. Idunn, the wife of Bragi, and a purely Norse creation, seems  to be a double of Freyja; she, too, according to Snorri, is carried  away by the giants and rescued by Loki. The golden apples which she  is to keep till Ragnaroek remind us of those which Frey offered to  Gerd; and the gift of eternal youth, of which they are the symbols,  would be appropriate enough to Freyja as an agricultural deity.    The great necklace Brising, stolen by Loki and won back in fight  by Heimdal (according to the tenth-century Skalds Thjodulf and Ulf  Uggason), is Freyja's property. On this ground, she has been identified  with the heroine of _Svipdag and Menglad_, a poem undoubtedly old,  though it has only come down in paper MSS. It is in two parts, the  first telling how Svipdag aroused the Sibyl Groa, his mother, to  give him spells to guard him on his journey; the second describing  his crossing the wall of fire which surrounded his fated bride  Menglad. If Menglad is really Freyja, the \"Necklace-glad,\" it is a  curious coincidence that one poem connects the waverlowe, or ring of  fire, with Frey also; for his bride Gerd is protected in the same way,  though his servant Skirni goes through it in his place:    _Skirni_. \"Give me the horse that will bear me through the dark magic  waverlowe, and the sword that fights of itself against the giant-race.\"    _Frey_. \"I give thee the horse that will bear thee through the dark  magic waverlowe, and the sword that will fight of itself if he is  bold who bears it.\" (_Skirnisfoer_.)    The connexion of both with the Midsummer fires, originally part of  an agricultural ritual, can hardly be doubted.           *       *       *       *       *    _Loki_, or Lopt, is a strange figure. He is admitted among the Aesir,  though not one of them by birth, and his whole relation to them  points to his being an older elemental God. He is in alliance with  them against the giants; he and Odin have sworn blood-brothership,  according to _Lokasenna_, and he helps Thor to recover his hammer  that Asgard may be defended against the giants. On the other hand,  while in present alliance with the Gods, he is chief agent in their  future destruction, and this they know. In Snorri, he is a mischievous  spirit of the fairy-tale kind, exercising his ingenuity alternately in  getting the Gods into difficulties, and in getting them out again. So  he betrays Idunn to the giants, and delivers her; he makes the bargain  by which Freyja is promised to the giant-builders of Valhalla,  and invents the trick by which they are cheated of their prize;  by killing the otter he endangers his own head, Odin's and Hoeni's,  and he obtains the gold which buys their atonement. Hence, in the  systematising of the Viking religion, the responsibility for Baldr's  death also was transferred to him. At the coming of the fire-giants  at Ragnaroek, he is to steer the ship in which Muspell's sons sail  (_Voeluspa_), further evidence of his identity as a fire-spirit. Like  his son the Wolf, he is chained by the Gods; the episode is related  in a prose-piece affixed to _Lokasenna_:    \"After that Loki hid himself in Franangr's Foss in the form of  a salmon. There the Aesir caught him. He was bound with the guts  of his son Nari, but his son Narfi was changed into a wolf. Skadi  took a poisonous snake and fastened it up over Loki's face, and the  poison dropped down. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat there and held a cup  under the poison. But when it was full she poured the poison away,  and meanwhile poison dropped on Loki, and he struggled so hard that  all the earth shook; those are called earthquakes now.\"    _Voeluspa_ inserts lines corresponding to this passage after the  Baldr episode, and Snorri makes it a consequence of Loki's share in  that event.    He is more especially agent of the doom through his children:  at Ragnaroek, Fenri the Wolf, bound long before by Tyr's help,  will be freed, and swallow the sun (_Vafthrudnismal_) and Odin  (_Vafthrudnismal_ and _Voeluspa_); and Joermungandr, the Giant-Snake,  will rise from the sea where he lies curled round the world, to slay  and be slain by Thor. The dragon's writhing in the waves is one  of the tokens to herald Ragnaroek, and his battle with Thor is the  fiercest combat of that day. Only _Voeluspa_ of our poems gives any  account of it: \"Then comes the glorious son of Hlodyn, Odin's son  goes to meet the serpent; Midgard's guardian slays him in his rage,  but scarcely can Earth's son reel back nine feet from the dragon.\"    When Thor goes fishing with the giant Hymi, he terrifies his companion  by dragging the snake's head out of the sea, but he does not slay it;  it must wait there till Ragnaroek:    \"Th"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#4)"],[1,"has broken faith with him, and the Giukings with  some reluctance murder their sister's husband. Brynhild springs on to  the funeral pyre, and dies with Sigurd.  _Voelsunga_ makes the murder  take place in Sigurd's chamber, and one poem, the _Short Sigurd Lay_,  agrees. The fragment which follows _Sigrdrifumal_, on the other hand,  places the scene in the open air:    \"Sigurd was slain south of the Rhine; a raven on a tree called aloud:  'On you will Atli redden the sword; your broken oaths shall destroy  you.' Gudrun Giuki's daughter stood without, and these were the first  words she spoke: 'Where is now Sigurd, the lord of men, that my kinsmen  ride first?' Hoegni alone made answer: 'We have hewn Sigurd asunder  with the sword; the grey horse still stoops over his dead lord.'\"    This agrees with the _Old Gudrun Lay_ and with the Continental German  version, as a prose epilogue points out.    Of the Giuking brothers, Gunnar appears only in a contemptible light:  he gains his bride by treachery, and keeps his oath to Sigurd by a  quibble. Hoegni, who has little but his name in common with Hagen von  Tronje of the _Nibelungen Lied_, advises Gunnar against breaking his  oath, but it is he who taunts Gudrun afterwards. The later poems of  the cycle try to make heroes out of both; the same discrepancy exists  between the first and second halves of the _Nibelungen Lied_. Their  half-brother, Gutthorm, plays no part in the story except as the  actual murderer of Sigurd.    The chief effect of the influences of Christianity and Romance on  the legend is a loss of sympathy with the heroic type of Brynhild,  and an attempt to give more dignity to the figure of Gudrun. The  Shield-maiden of divine origin and unearthly wisdom, with her  unrelenting vengeance on her beloved, and her contempt for her  slighter rival (\"Fitter would it be for Gudrun to die with Sigurd,  if she had a soul like mine\"), is a figure out of harmony with the new  religion, and beyond the comprehension of a time coloured by romance;  while both the sentiment and the morality of the age would be on the  side of Gudrun as the formally wedded wife. So the poem known as the  _Short Sigurd Lay_, which has many marks of lateness, such as the  elaborate description of the funeral pyre and the exaggeration of  the signs of mourning, says nothing of Sigurd's love for Brynhild,  nor do his last words to Gudrun give any hint of it. The _Nibelungen  Lied_ suppresses Sigurd's love to Brynhild, and the magic drink, and  altogether lowers Brynhild, but elevates Gudrun (under her mother's  name); her slow but terrible vengeance, and absolute forgetfulness  of the ties of blood in pursuit of it, are equal to anything in the  original version. The later heroic poems of the Edda make a less  successful attempt to create sympathy for Gudrun; some, such as the  so-called _First Gudrun Lay_, which is entirely romantic in character,  try to make her pathetic by the abundance of tears she sheds; others,  to make her heroic, though the result is only a spurious savagery.    The remaining poems of the cycle, all late in style and tone, deal  with the fates of Gudrun and her brothers, and owe their existence  to a narrator's unwillingness to let a favourite story end. The  curse makes continuation easy, since the Giukings inherit it with the  hoard. Gudrun was married at the wish of her kinsmen to Atli the Hun,  said to be Brynhild's brother. He invited Gunnar and Hoegni to his  court and killed them for the sake of the treasure, in vengeance for  which Gudrun killed her own two sons and Atli; this latter incident  being possibly an imitation of Signy. If we may believe that Gudrun,  like Chriemhild in the _Nibelungen Lied_, married Atli in order to  gain vengeance for Sigurd, we might suppose that there was confusion  here: that she herself incited the murder of her brothers, and killed  Atli when he had served his purpose. This would strengthen the part  of Gudrun, who as the tale stands is rather a futile character. But  in all probability the episode is due to a confusion of Signy's story  with that of the German Chriemhild and Etzel.    One point has still to be considered: the place of the Nibelungs in the  story. In the Edda, the Hniflungs are always the Giukings, Gunnar and  Hoegni, and Snorri gives it as the name of an heroic family. The title  of the first _aventiure_ of the _Nibelungen Lied_ also apparently uses  the word of the Burgundians. Yet the treasure is always the Nibelungs'  hoard, which clearly means that they were the original owners; and when  Hagen von Tronje tells the story later in the poem, he speaks of the  Nibelungs correctly as the dwarfs from whom Siegfried won it. On this  point, therefore, the German preserves the older tradition: the Norse  Andvari, the river-dwarf, is the German Alberich the Nibelung. In  the _Nibelungen Lied_ the winning of the treasure forms no part of  the action: it is merely narrated by Hagen. This accounts for the  shortening of the episode and the omission of the intermediate steps:  the robbing of the dwarf, the curse, and the dragon-slaying.           *       *       *       *       *    _Ermanric.--_The two poems of _Gudrun's Lament_ and _Hamthismal_,  in the Edda attached to the Volsung cycle, belong correctly to  that of the Gothic hero Ermanric. According to these poems, Gudrun,  Giuki's daughter, married a third time, and had three sons, Soerli,  Hamthi and Erp. She married Svanhild, her own and Sigurd's daughter,  to Joermunrek, king of the Goths; but Svanhild was slandered, and her  husband had her trodden to death by horses' hoofs. The description  of Svanhild is a good example of the style of the romantic poems:    \"The bondmaids sat round Svanhild, dearest of my children; Svanhild  was like a glorious sunbeam in my hall. I dowered her with gold  and goodly fabrics when I married her into Gothland. That was the  hardest of my griefs, when they trod Svanhild's fair hair into the  dust beneath the horses' hoofs.\"    Gudrun sent her three sons to avenge their sister; two of them  slew Erp by the way, and were killed themselves in their attack on  Joermunrek for want of his help. So died, as Snorri says, all who were  of Giuking descent; and only Aslaug, daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild,  survived. _Heimskringla_, a thirteenth century history of the royal  races of Scandinavia, traces the descent of the Norse kings from her.    This Ermanric story, which belongs to legendary history rather than  myth, is in reality quite independent of the Volsung or Nibelung  cycle. The connection is loose and inartistic, the legend being  probably linked to Gudrun's name because she had become a favourite  character and Icelandic narrators were unwilling to let her die. The  historic Ermanric was conquered by the Huns in 374; the sixth century  historian Jornandes is the earliest authority for the tradition that he  was murdered by Sarus and Ammius in revenge for their sister's death  by wild horses. Saxo also tells the story, with greater similarity  of names. It seems hardly necessary to assume, with many scholars,  the existence of two heroes of the name Ermanric, an historic and  a mythical one. A simpler explanation is that a legendary story  became connected with the name of a real personage. The slaying of  Erp introduces a common folk-tale incident, familiar in stories like  the _Golden Bird_, told by both Asbjoernsen and Grimm.           *       *       *       *       *    _Helgi._--The Helgi-lays, three in number, are the best of the  heroic poems. Nominally they tell two stories, Helgi Hjoervardsson  being sandwiched between the two poems of Helgi Hundingsbane; but  essentially the stories are the same.    In _Helyi Hjoervardsson_, Helgi, son of Hjoervard and Sigrlinn, was dumb  and nameless until a certain day when, while sitting on a howe, he  saw a troop of nine Valkyries. The fairest, Svava, Eylimi's daughter,  named him, and bidding him avenge his grandfather on Hrodmar (a former  wooer of Sigrlinn's, and her father's slayer), sent him to find a  magic sword. Helgi slew Hrodmar and married Svava, having escaped  from the sea-giantess Hrimgerd through the protection of his Valkyrie  bride and the wit of a faithful servant. His brother Hedin, through  the spells of a troll-wife, swore to wed Helgi's bride. Repenting, he  told his brother, who, dying in a fight with Hrodmar's son, charged  Svava to marry Hedin. A note by the collector adds \"Helgi and Svava  are said to have been born again.\"    In _Helgi Hundingsbane I_., Helgi is the son of Sigmund and  Borghild. He fought and slew Hunding, and afterwards met in battle  Hunding's sons at Logafell, where the Valkyrie Sigrun, Hoegni's  daughter, protected him, and challenged him to fight Hoedbrodd to whom  her father had plighted her. She protected his ships in the storm which  overtook them as they sailed to meet Hoedbrodd, and watched over him in  the battle, in which he slew his rival and was greeted as victor by  Sigrun: \"Hail, hero of Yngvi's race ... thou shalt have both the red  rings and the mighty maid: thine are Hoegni's daughter and Hringstad,  the victory and the land.\"    _Helgi Hundingsbane II_., besides giving additional details of the  hero's early life, completes the story. In the battle with Hoedbrodd,  Helgi killed all Sigrun's kinsmen except one brother, Dag, who slew  him later in vengeance. But Helgi returned from the grave, awakened by  Sigrun's weeping, and she went into the howe with him. The collector  again adds a note: \"Helgi and Sigrun are said to have been born again:  he was then called Helgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kara Halfdan's  daughter, as it is told in the Kara-ljod, and she was a Valkyrie.\"    This third Helgi legend does not survive in verse, the _Kara-ljod_  having perished. It is told in prose in the late saga of Hromund  Gripsson, according to which Kara was a Valkyrie and swan-maid: while  she was hovering over"]]]
