It is perfectly true that I am assisting and countenancing  the union between Hindus and Muslims, but certainly not with \"a view of  embarrassing England and the Allied Powers in the matter of the  dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire,\" it is contrary to my creed to  embarrass governments or anybody else. This does not how ever mean that  certain acts of mine may not result in embarrassment. But I should not  hold myself responsible for having caused embarrassment when I resist  the wrong of a wrong-doer by refusing assistance in his wrong-doing. On  the Khilafat question I refuse to be party to a broken pledge. Mr. Lloyd  George's solemn declaration is practically the whole of the case for  Indian Mahomedans and when that case is fortified by scriptural  authority it becomes unanswerable. Moreover, it is incorrect to say that  I have \"allied myself to one of the prevailing anarchies\" or that I have  wrongly countenanced the movement to place the cruel and unjust  despotism of the Stamboul Government above the interests of humanity.  In the whole of the Mahomedan demand there is no insistance on the  retention of the so-called unjust despotism of the Stamboul Government;  on the contrary the Mahomedans have accepted the principle of taking  full guarantees from that Government for the protection of non-Muslim  minorities. I do not know how far the condition of Armenia and Syria may  be considered an 'anarchy' and how far the Turkish Government may be  held responsible for it. I much suspect that the reports from these  quarters are much exaggerated and that the European powers are  themselves in a measure responsible for what misrule there may be in  Armenia and Syria. But I am in no way interested in supporting Turkish  or any other anarchy. The Allied Powers can easily prevent it by means  other than that of ending Turkish rule or dismembering and weakening the  Ottoman Empire. The Allied Powers are not dealing with a new situation.  If Turkey was to be partitioned, the position should have been made  clear at the commencement of the war. There would then have been no  question of a broken pledge. As it is, no Indian Mahomedan has any  regard for the promises of British Ministers. In his opinion, the cry  against Turkey is that of Christianity _vs._ Islam with England as the  louder in the cry. The latest cablegram from Mr. Mahomed Ali strengthens  the impression, for he says that unlike as in England his deputation is  receiving much support from the French Government and the people.    Thus, if it is true, as I hold it is true that the Indian Mussalmans  have a cause that is just and is supported by scriptural authority, then  for the Hindus not to support them to the utmost would be a cowardly  breach of brotherhood and they would forfeit all claim to consideration  from their Mahomedan countrymen. As a public-server therefore, I would  be unworthy of the position I claim, if I did not support Indian  Mussalmans in their struggle to maintain the Khilafat in accordance with  their religious belief. I believe that in supporting them I am rendering  a service to the Empire, because by assisting my Mahomedan countrymen to  give a disciplined expression to their sentiment it becomes possible to  make the agitation thoroughly, orderly and even successful.      THE TURKISH TREATY    The Turkish treaty will be out on the 10th of May. It is stated to  provide for the internationalisation of the Straits, the occupation of  Gallipoli by the Allies, the maintenance of Allied contingents in  Constantinople and the appointment of a Commission of Control over  Turkish finances. The San Remo Conference has entrusted Britain with  Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine and France with the Mandate for  Syria. As regards Smyrna the accounts so far received inform that  Turkish suzerainty over Smyrna will be indicated by the fact that the  population will not be entitled to send delegates to the Greek  Parliament but at the end of five years local Smyrna Parliament will  have the right of voting in favour of union with Greece and in such an  event Turkish suzerainty will cease. Turkish suzerainty will be confined  to the area within the Chatalja lines. With regard to Emir Foisul's  position there is no news except that the Mandates of Britain and France  transform his military title into a civil title.           *       *       *       *      *    We have given above the terms of the Turkish treaty as indicated in  Router's messages. These reports are incomplete and all of them are not  equally authenticated. But if these terms are true, they are a challenge  to the Muslim demands. Turkish Sovereignty is confined to the Chatalja  lines. This means that the Big Three of the Supreme Council have cut off  Thrace from Turkish dominions. This is a distinct breach of the pledge  given by one of these Three, _viz._, the Premier of the British Empire.  To remain within the Chatalja lines and, we are afraid, as a dependent  of the Allies, is for the Sultan a humiliating position inconsistent  with the Koranic injunctions. Such a restricted position of the Turks is  virtually a success of the bag and baggage school.    It is not yet known how the Supreme Council disposed of the rich and  renowned lands of Asia Minor. If Mr. Lloyd George's views recently  expressed in this respect have received the Allies' sanction--it is  probable--nothing less than a common control is expected. The decision  in the case of Smyrna will be satisfying to none, though the Allies seem  to have made by their arrangement a skillful attempt to please all the  parties concerned. Mr. Lloyd George, in his reply to the Khilafat  Deputation, had talked about the careful investigations by an impartial  committee and had added; \"The great majority of the population  undoubtedly prefer Greek rule to Turkish rule, so I understand\" But the  decision postpones to carry out his understanding till a period of  five years.           *       *       *       *      *    When we come to the question of mandates, the Allied Powers' motives  come out more distinctly. The Arabs' claim of independence was used as a  difficulty against keeping Turkish Sovereignty. This was defended in the  of self-determination and by pointing out parallels of Transylvania and  other provinces. When the final moment came, the Allies have ventured to  divide the spoils amongst themselves. Britain is given the mandate over  Mesopotamia and Palestine and France has the mandate over Syria. The  Arab delegation complains in their note lately issued expressing their  disappointment at the Supreme Council's decision with regard to the  Arab liberated countries, which, it declares, is contrary to the  principle of self-determination.           *       *       *       *       *    So what little news has arrived about the Turkish treaty, is uniformly  disquieting. The Moslems have found sufficient ground to honour Russia,  more than the Allies. Russia has recognised the freedom of Khiva and  Bokhara. The Moslem world, as H. M. the Amir of Afghanistan said in his  speech, will feel grateful towards Russia in spite of all the rumours  abroad about its anarchy and disorder, whereas the whole Moslem world  will resent the action of the other European nations who have allied  with each other to carry out a joint coercion and extinction of Turkey  in the name of self-determination and partly in the guise of the  interest of civilization.           *       *       *       *      *    The terms of the Turkish treaty are not only a breach of the Premier's  pledge, not only a sin against the principle of self-determination, but  they also show a reckless indifference of the Allied Powers towards the  Koranic injunctions. The terms point out that Mr. Lloyd George's  misinformed ideas of Khilafat have prevailed in the Council. Like Mr.  Lloyd George other statesmen also at San Remo have compared Caliphate  with Popedom and ignored the Koronic idea of associating spiritual  power with temporal power. These misguided statesmen were too much  possessed by haughtiness and so they refused to receive any  enlightenment on the question of Khilafat from the Deputation. They  could have corrected themselves had they heard Mr. Mahomed Ali on this  point. Speaking at the Essex Hall meeting Mr. Mahomed Ali distinguished  between Popedom and Caliphate and clearly explained what Caliphate  means. He said:       \"Islam is supernational and not national, the basis of Islamic     sympathy is a common outlook on life and common culture.... And it     has two centres. The personal centre is the island of Arabia. The     Khalifa is the Commander of the Faithful and his orders must be     obeyed by all Muslims so long and so long only, as they are not at     variance with the Commandments of God and the Traditions of the     Prophet. But since there is no lacerating distinction between things     temporal and things spiritual, the Khalifa is something more than a     Pope and cannot be \"Vaticanised.\" But he is also less than a Pope for     he is not infallible. If he persists in un-Islamic conduct we can     depose him. And we have deposed him more than once. But so long as he     orders only that which Islam demands we must support him. He and no     other ruler is the Defender of _our_ faith.\"    These few words could have removed the mis-undertakings rooted in the  minds of those that at San Remo, if they were in earnest for a just  solution. But Mr. Mahomed Ali's deputation was not given any hearing by  the Peace Conference. They were told that the Peace Conference had  already heard the official delegation of India on this question. But the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#4)"],[1,"were all sizes  and colors. Among them were some of colored glass. Walking with my  mother to the river, on a late winter day, we found great chunks of ice  piled all along the bank. The ice on the river was floating in huge  pieces. As I stood beside one large block, I noticed for the first time  the colors of the rainbow in the crystal ice. Immediately I thought of  my glass marbles at home. With my bare fingers I tried to pick out some  of the colors, for they seemed so near the surface. But my fingers  began to sting with the intense cold, and I had to bite them hard to  keep from crying.    From that day on, for many a moon, I believed that glass marbles had  river ice inside of them.          VII.    THE BIG RED APPLES.      The first turning away from the easy, natural flow of my life occurred  in an early spring. It was in my eighth year; in the month of March, I  afterward learned. At this age I knew but one language, and that was my  mother's native tongue.    From some of my playmates I heard that two paleface missionaries were in  our village. They were from that class of white men who wore big hats  and carried large hearts, they said. Running direct to my mother, I  began to question her why these two strangers were among us. She told  me, after I had teased much, that they had come to take away Indian boys  and girls to the East. My mother did not seem to want me to talk about  them. But in a day or two, I gleaned many wonderful stories from my  playfellows concerning the strangers.    \"Mother, my friend Judewin is going home with the missionaries. She is  going to a more beautiful country than ours; the palefaces told her  so!\" I said wistfully, wishing in my heart that I too might go.    Mother sat in a chair, and I was hanging on her knee. Within the last  two seasons my big brother Dawee had returned from a three years'  education in the East, and his coming back influenced my mother to take  a farther step from her native way of living. First it was a change from  the buffalo skin to the white man's canvas that covered our wigwam. Now  she had given up her wigwam of slender poles, to live, a foreigner, in a  home of clumsy logs.    \"Yes, my child, several others besides Judewin are going away with the  palefaces. Your brother said the missionaries had inquired about his  little sister,\" she said, watching my face very closely.    My heart thumped so hard against my breast, I wondered if she could hear  it.    \"Did he tell them to take me, mother?\" I asked, fearing lest Dawee had  forbidden the palefaces to see me, and that my hope of going to the  Wonderland would be entirely blighted.    With a sad, slow smile, she answered: \"There! I knew you were wishing to  go, because Judewin has filled your ears with the white man's lies.  Don't believe a word they say! Their words are sweet, but, my child,  their deeds are bitter. You will cry for me, but they will not even  soothe you. Stay with me, my little one! Your brother Dawee says that  going East, away from your mother, is too hard an experience for his  baby sister.\"    Thus my mother discouraged my curiosity about the lands beyond our  eastern horizon; for it was not yet an ambition for Letters that was  stirring me. But on the following day the missionaries did come to our  very house. I spied them coming up the footpath leading to our cottage.  A third man was with them, but he was not my brother Dawee. It was  another, a young interpreter, a paleface who had a smattering of the  Indian language. I was ready to run out to meet them, but I did not dare  to displease my mother. With great glee, I jumped up and down on our  ground floor. I begged my mother to open the door, that they would be  sure to come to us. Alas! They came, they saw, and they conquered!    Judewin had told me of the great tree where grew red, red apples; and  how we could reach out our hands and pick all the red apples we could  eat. I had never seen apple trees. I had never tasted more than a dozen  red apples in my life; and when I heard of the orchards of the East, I  was eager to roam among them. The missionaries smiled into my eyes and  patted my head. I wondered how mother could say such hard words against  him.    \"Mother, ask them if little girls may have all the red apples they want,  when they go East,\" I whispered aloud, in my excitement.    The interpreter heard me, and answered: \"Yes, little girl, the nice red  apples are for those who pick them; and you will have a ride on the iron  horse if you go with these good people.\"    I had never seen a train, and he knew it.    \"Mother, I am going East! I like big red apples, and I want to ride on  the iron horse! Mother, say yes!\" I pleaded.    My mother said nothing. The missionaries waited in silence; and my eyes  began to blur with tears, though I struggled to choke them back. The  corners of my mouth twitched, and my mother saw me.    \"I am not ready to give you any word,\" she said to them. \"Tomorrow I  shall send you my answer by my son.\"    With this they left us. Alone with my mother, I yielded to my tears, and  cried aloud, shaking my head so as not to hear what she was saying to  me. This was the first time I had ever been so unwilling to give up my  own desire that I refused to hearken to my mother's voice.    There was a solemn silence in our home that night. Before I went to bed  I begged the Great Spirit to make my mother willing I should go with the  missionaries.    The next morning came, and my mother called me to her side. \"My  daughter, do you still persist in wishing to leave your mother?\" she  asked.    \"Oh, mother, it is not that I wish to leave you, but I want to see the  wonderful Eastern land,\" I answered.    My dear old aunt came to our house that morning, and I heard her say,  \"Let her try it.\"    I hoped that, as usual, my aunt was pleading on my side. My brother  Dawee came for mother's decision. I dropped my play, and crept close to  my aunt.    \"Yes, Dawee, my daughter, though she does not understand what it all  means, is anxious to go. She will need an education when she is grown,  for then there will be fewer real Dakotas, and many more palefaces. This  tearing her away, so young, from her mother is necessary, if I would  have her an educated woman. The palefaces, who owe us a large debt for  stolen lands, have begun to pay a tardy justice in offering some  education to our children. But I know my daughter must suffer keenly in  this experiment. For her sake, I dread to tell you my reply to the  missionaries. Go, tell them that they may take my little daughter, and  that the Great Spirit shall not fail to reward them according to their  hearts.\"    Wrapped in my heavy blanket, I walked with my mother to the carriage  that was soon to take us to the iron horse. I was happy. I met my  playmates, who were also wearing their best thick blankets. We showed  one another our new beaded moccasins, and the width of the belts that  girdled our new dresses. Soon we were being drawn rapidly away by the  white man's horses. When I saw the lonely figure of my mother vanish in  the distance, a sense of regret settled heavily upon me. I felt  suddenly weak, as if I might fall limp to the ground. I was in the hands  of strangers whom my mother did not fully trust. I no longer felt free  to be myself, or to voice my own feelings. The tears trickled down my  cheeks, and I buried my face in the folds of my blanket. Now the first  step, parting me from my mother, was taken, and all my belated tears  availed nothing.    Having driven thirty miles to the ferryboat, we crossed the Missouri in  the evening. Then riding again a few miles eastward, we stopped before a  massive brick building. I looked at it in amazement, and with a vague  misgiving, for in our village I had never seen so large a house.  Trembling with fear and distrust of the palefaces, my teeth chattering  from the chilly ride, I crept noiselessly in my soft moccasins along the  narrow hall, keeping very close to the bare wall. I was as frightened  and bewildered as the captured young of a wild creature.          THE SCHOOL DAYS OF AN INDIAN GIRL    I.    THE LAND OF RED APPLES.      There were eight in our party of bronzed children who were going East  with the missionaries. Among us were three young braves, two tall girls,  and we three little ones, Judewin, Thowin, and I.    We had been very impatient to start on our journey to the Red Apple  Country, which, we were told, lay a little beyond the great circular  horizon of the Western prairie. Under a sky of rosy apples we dreamt of  roaming as freely and happily as we had chased the cloud shadows on the  Dakota plains. We had anticipated much pleasure from a ride on the iron  horse, but the throngs of staring palefaces disturbed and troubled us.    On the train, fair women, with tottering babies on each arm, stopped  their haste and scrutinized the children of absent mothers. Large men,  with heavy bundles in their hands, halted near by, and riveted their  glassy blue eyes upon us.    I sank deep into the corner of my seat, for I resented being watched.  Directly in front of me, children who were no larger than I hung  themselves upon the backs of their seats, with their bold white faces  toward me. Sometimes they took their forefingers out of their mouths and  pointed at my moccasined feet. Their mothers, instead of reproving such  rude curiosity, looked closely at me, and attracted their children's  further notice to my blanket. This embarrassed me, and kept me  constantly on the verge of tears.    I sat perfectly still, with my eyes downcast, daring only now and then  to shoot long glances around me. Chancing to turn to the window at my  side, I was quite breathless upon seeing one familiar object. It was the  telegraph pole which strode by at short paces. Very near my mother's  dwelling, along the edge of a road thickly bordered with wild  sunflowers, some poles like these"]]]
