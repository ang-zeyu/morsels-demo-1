The dead have here what to the dead belongs,    Though legislation makes not laws, but wrongs.\"    I sought a letter'd stone, on which my tears    Had fall'n like thunder-rain, in other years,    My mother's grave I sought, in my despair,    But found it not! our grave-stone was not there!    No we were fallen men, mere workhouse slaves,    And how could fallen men have names or graves?    I thought of sorrow in the wilderness,    And death in solitude, and pitiless    Interment in the tiger's hideous maw:    I pray'd, and, praying, turn'd from all I saw;    My prayers were curses! But the sexton came;    How my heart yearn'd to name my Hannah's name!    White was his hair, for full of days was he,    And walk'd o'er tombstones, like their history.    With well feign'd carelessness I rais'd a spade,    Left near a grave, which seem'd but newly made,    And ask'd who slept below? \"You knew him well,\"    The old man answer'd, \"Sir, his name was Bell.    He had a sister--she, alas! is gone,    Body and soul. Sir! for she married one    Unworthy of her. Many a corpse he took    From this churchyard.\" And then his head he shook,    And utter'd--whispering low, as if in fear    That the old stones and senseless dead would hear--    A word, a verb, a noun, too widely famed,    Which makes me blush to hear my country named.    That word he utter'd, gazing on my face,    As if he loath'd my thoughts, then paus'd a space.    \"Sir,\" he resumed, \"a sad death Hannah died;    Her husband--kill'd her, or his own son lied.    Vain is your voyage o'er the briny wave,    If here you seek her grave--she had no grave!    The terror-stricken murderer fled before    His crime was known, and ne'er was heard of more.    The poor boy died, sir! uttering fearful cries    In his last dreams, and with his glaring eyes,    And troubled hands, seem'd acting, as it were,    His mother's fate. Yes, Sir, his grave is there.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE SELECTOR AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.    LANDERS' DISCOVERY OF THE TERMINATION OF THE NIGER      Our readers are already in possession of the outline of this memorable  journey; though nothing but an attentive perusal of the Discoverers'  Narrative can afford them the remotest idea of the dangers they  encountered in their progress. To gratify this curiosity, Mr. Murray has  considerately enough, printed their Journal in three volumes of the  _Family Library_, and to say that they are, in interest, equal if not  superior to any of the Series would be praise inadequate to their merits.  The simple, unvarnished style of the Narrative is just suitable for a  family fireside. We intend to quote a few scenes: at present    _An African Horse-Race_,    at Kiama, in the kingdom of Borgoo from the first volume.    \"In the afternoon, all the inhabitants of the town, and many from the  little villages in its neighbourhood, assembled to witness the  horse-racing, which takes place always on the anniversary of the 'Bebun  Salah,' and to which every one had been looking forward with impatience.  Previous to its commencement, the king, with his principal attendants,  rode slowly round the town, more for the purpose of receiving the  admiration and plaudits of his people than to observe where distress more  particularly prevailed, which was his avowed intention. A hint from the  chief induced us to attend the course with our pistols, to salute him as  he rode by; and as we felt a strong inclination to witness the amusements  of the day, we were there rather sooner than was necessary, which afforded  us, however, a fairer opportunity of observing the various groups of  people which were flocking to the scene of amusement.    \"The race-course was bounded on the north by low granite hills; on the  south by a forest; and on the east and west by tall shady trees, among  which were habitations of the people. Under the shadow of these  magnificent trees the spectators were assembled, and testified their  happiness by their noisy mirth and animated gestures. When we arrived, the  king had not made his appearance on the course; but his absence was fully  compensated by the pleasure we derived from watching the anxious and  animated countenances of the multitude, and in passing our opinions on the  taste of the women in the choice and adjustment of their fanciful and  many-coloured dresses. The chief's wives and younger children sat near us  in a group by themselves; and were distinguished from their companions by  their superior dress. Manchester cloths of inferior quality, but of the  most showy patterns, and dresses made of common English bed-furniture,  were fastened round the waist of several sooty maidens, who, for the sake  of fluttering a short hour in the gaze of their countrymen, had sacrificed  in clothes the earnings of a twelve-month's labour. All the women had  ornamented their necks with strings of beads, and their wrists with  bracelets of various patterns, some made of glass beads, some of brass,  others of copper; and some again of a mixture of both metals: their ancles  also were adorned with different sorts of rings, of neat workmanship.    \"The distant sound of drums gave notice of the king's approach, and every  eye was immediately directed to the quarter from whence he was expected.  The cavalcade shortly appeared, and four horsemen first drew up in front  of the chief's house, which was near the centre of the course, and close  to the spot where his wives and children and ourselves were sitting.  Several men bearing on their heads an immense quantity of arrows in huge  quivers of leopard's skin came next, followed by two persons who, by their  extraordinary antics and gestures, we concluded to be buffoons. These two  last were employed in throwing sticks into the air as they went on, and  adroitly catching them in falling, besides performing many whimsical and  ridiculous feats. Behind these, and immediately preceding the king, a  group of little boys, nearly naked came dancing merrily along, flourishing  cows' tails over their heads in all directions. The king rode onwards,  followed by a number of fine-looking men, on handsome steeds; and the  motley cavalcade all drew up in front of his house, where they awaited his  further orders without dismounting. This we thought was the proper time to  give the first salute, so we accordingly fired three rounds; and our  example was immediately followed by two soldiers, with muskets which were  made at least a century and a half ago.    \"Preparations in the mean time had been going on for the race, and the  horses with their riders made their appearance. The men were dressed in  caps and loose tobes and trousers of every colour; boots of red morocco  leather, and turbans of white and blue cotton. The horses were gaily  caparisoned; strings of little brass bells covered their heads; their  breasts were ornamented with bright red cloth and tassels of silk and  cotton; a large quilted pad of neat embroidered patchwork was placed under  the saddle of each; and little charms, enclosed in red and yellow cloth,  were attached to the bridle with bits of tinsel. The Arab saddle and  stirrup were in common use; and the whole group presented an imposing  appearance.    \"The signal for starting was made, and the impatient animals sprung  forward and set off at a full gallop. The riders brandished their spears,  the little boys flourished their cows' tails, the buffoons performed their  antics, muskets were discharged, and the chief himself, mounted on the  finest horse on the ground, watched the progress of the race, while tears  of delight were starting from his eyes. The sun shone gloriously on the  tobes of green, white, yellow, blue, and crimson, as they fluttered in the  breeze; and with the fanciful caps, the glittering spears, the jingling of  the horses' bells, the animated looks and warlike bearing of their riders,  presented one of the most extraordinary and pleasing sights that we have  ever witnessed. The race was well contested, and terminated only by the  horses being fatigued and out of breath; but though every one was emulous  to outstrip his companion, honour and fame were the only reward of the  competitors.    \"A few naked boys, on ponies without saddles, then rode over the course,  after which the second and last heat commenced. This was not by any means  so good as the first, owing to the greater anxiety which the horsemen  evinced to display their skill in the use of the spear and the management  of their animals. The king maintained his seat on horseback during these  amusements, without even once dismounting to converse with his wives and  children who were sitting on the ground on each side of him. His dress was  showy rather than rich, consisting of a red cap, enveloped in the large  folds of a white muslin turban; two under tobes of blue and scarlet cloth,  and an outer one of white muslin; red trousers, and boots of scarlet and  yellow leather. His horse seemed distressed by the weight of his rider,  and the various ornaments and trappings with which his head, breast, and  body, were bedecked. The chief's eldest and youngest sons were near his  women and other children, mounted on two noble looking horses. The eldest  of these youths was about eleven years of age. The youngest being not more  than three, was held on the back of his animal by a male attendant, as he  was unable to sit upright in the saddle without this assistance. The  child's dress was ill suited to his age. He wore on his head a tight cap  of Manchester cotton,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12552"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 19, No. 542, April (#4)"],[1,"we took them in again. We found the description to be  in no wise exaggerated; it presented a most forbidding appearance, and  yields only to the state of the Niger near Boossa in difficulty and danger.  On our arrival at this formidable place, we discovered a range of black  rocks running directly across the stream, and the water, finding only one  narrow passage, rushed through it with great impetuosity, over-turning and  carrying away everything in its course. Our boatmen, with the assistance  of a number of the natives, who planted themselves on the rocks on each  side of the only channel, and in the stream at the stern of the canoe,  lifted it by main force into smoother and safer water. The last difficulty  with respect to rocks and sand-banks was now overcome, and in a very  little time we came to the termination of all the islands, after which, it  is said, there is not a single dangerous place up the Niger. The river  here presented its noblest appearance; not a single rock nor sand-bank was  anywhere perceptible; its borders resumed their beauty, and a strong,  refreshing breeze, which had blown during the whole of the morning, now  gave it the motion of a slightly-agitated sea. In the course of the  morning we passed two lovely little islands, clothed in verdure, which at  a short distance looked as charming as the fabled gardens of Hesperia;  indeed no spot on earth can excel them in beauty of appearance. These  islands are inhabited by a few individuals.\"    Upon leaving Yaoorie, a venerable Arab chief pretended great regard for  the travellers, though he used them deceitfully; they had, however,  \"enjoyed an innocent kind of revenge, in administering to him a powerful  dose of medicine, which though harmless in its effects, had yet been very  troublesome to him. Indeed, it was not till we had 'jalaped' the sultan,  his sister, and all the royal family, that we were permitted to take our  farewell of Yaoorie.\"    The incident of physicking the royal family at Yaoorie by way of  leave-taking, is only equalled by the following oddity:--\"The captain of  the palm oil brig, Elizabeth, now in the Calabar river, actually  white-washed his crew from head to foot, while they were sick with fever  and unable to protect themselves; his cook suffered so much in the  operation, that the lime totally deprived him of the sight of one of his  eyes, and rendered the other of little service to him.\"    The account of the Travellers' visit to Fernando Po, in the third volume,  will be read with interest, as indeed will every page of the whole  narrative; and to this commendation of the Messrs. Landers' Journal of  their past adventures we cheerfully add our best wishes for the success of  their future enterprize.           *       *       *       *       *      SONGS OF THE GIPSIES.    Among the musical novelties of the day, we notice with much pleasure, a  pretty volume of Lyrics, written by Mr. Moncrieff, the music by Mr. S.  Nelson. The poetry is throughout sparkling and characteristic, and \"an  Historical Introduction on the origin and customs of Gipsies,\" prefixed to  the Songs, is so attractive as to be likely to share the popularity of the  piano-forte accompaniments. It is written with considerable care and  neatness, and the peculiar tact requisite to produce an interesting paper  on a dry subject.    We are only enabled to quote from the lyrics, an opening carol, as      Liberty, liberty!        Search the world round,    'Tis with the Gipsy        Alone thou art found.    Then in the gay greenwood        We worship thee now,    The free, oh the free!        Still live under the bough.      Trarah! Trarah!        Hark, the deep dingles ring,    Free hearts, with the bird        And the deer are on wing;    Joy claims in the greenwood        The Gipsy's glad vow,    The blithe, oh the blithe!        Still live under the bough.    And the first song entire.    THE GIPSY QUEEN.      Oh! 'tis I am the Gipsy Queen!      And where is there queen like me,    That can revel upon the green,      In boundless liberty?    What though my cheek be brown,      And wild my raven hair,    A red cloth hood my crown,      And my sceptre the wand I bear!    Yet, 'tis I am the Gipsy Queen!      With my kingdom I'm well content,      Though my realm's but the hawthorn glade;    And my palace a tatter'd tent      Beneath the willow's shade:    Though my banquet I'm forc'd to make      On haws and berries store,    And the game that by chance we take      From some neighbouring hind's barn door!    Yet, 'tis I am the Gipsy Queen!      'Tis true I must ply my art,      And share in my subjects' toils;    But of all their gains I've part,      I've the choice of all their spoils;    And, by love and duty led,      Ere from my jet black eye    One sad tear should be shed,      A thousand hearts would die!    For, 'tis I am the Gipsy Queen!           *       *       *       *       *    A SONG OF PITCAIRN'S ISLAND.      Come, take our boy, and we will go      Before our cabin door;    The winds shall bring us, as they blow,      The murmurs of the shore;    And we will kiss his young blue eyes,    And I will sing him as he lies,      Songs that were made of yore:    I'll sing, in his delighted ear,    The island-lays thou lov'st to hear.      And thou, while stammering I repeat,      Thy country's tongue shalt teach;    'Tis not so soft, but far more sweet      Than my own native speech;    For thou no other tongue didst know,    When, scarcely twenty moons ago,      Upon Tahite's beach,    Thou cam'st to woo me to be thine,    With many a speaking look and sign.      I knew thy meaning--thou didst praise      My eyes, my locks of jet;    Ah! well for me they won thy gaze--      But thine were fairer yet!    I'm glad to see my infant wear    Thy soft blue eyes and sunny hair,      And when my sight is met    By his white brow and blooming cheek,    I feel a joy I cannot speak.      Come talk of Europe's maids with me,      Whose necks and cheeks, they tell,    Outshine the beauty of the sea,      White foam and crimson shell.    I'll shape like theirs my simple dress,    And bind like them each jetty tress,      A sight to please thee well;    And for my dusky brow will braid    A bonnet like an English maid.      Come, for the soft, low sunlight calls--      We lose the pleasant hours;    'Tis lovelier than these cottage walls--      That seat among the flowers.    And I will learn of thee a prayer    To Him who gave a home so fair,      A lot so blest as ours--    The God who made for thee and me    This sweet lone isle amid the sea.    _From a volume of American Poetry, William Cullen Bryant._           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: TOMB OF THE POET, WALLER.]      In the churchyard of Beaconsfield, Bucks, stands the above handsome  tribute to the memory of the celebrated poet and politician, EDMUND WALLER.  The monument is of marble, with a pyramid rising from the centre, and a  votive urn at each corner. On the east side is a Latin inscription,  stating that Waller was born March 30, 1605, at Coleshill, in  Hertfordshire; his father being Robert Waller, Esq. (of Agmondelsham in  Buckingham, whose family was originally a branch of the Kentish  Wallers,[5]) and his mother of the Hampden family; that he was a student  at Cambridge; \"his first wife was Anne, only daughter and heiress to  Edward Banks, twice made a father by his first wife, and thirteen times by  his second, whom he survived eight years; he died October 21, 1687.\" The  original inscription is by Rymer, and is to be seen in most editions of  the poet's works. The monument was erected by the poet's son's executors,  in 1700, and stands on the east side of the churchyard, near the family  vault. The above engraving is from a sketch, obligingly furnished by our  Correspondent, W.H. of Wycombe.    Waller was proprietor of the manor of Beaconsfield, and that of Hall Barn,  in the vicinity, at which latter place he resided.    It is remarkable, that this great man, toward the decline of life bought a  small house, with a little land, on his natal spot; observing, \"that he  should be glad to die like the stag, where he was roused.\" This, however,  did not happen. \"When he was at Beaconsfield,\" says Johnson, \"he found his  legs grow tumid: he went to Windsor, where Sir Charles Scarborough then  attended the king, and requested him, as both a friend and physician, to  tell him what that swelling meant. 'Sir,' answered Scarborough, 'your  blood will run no longer.' Waller repeated some lines of Virgil, and went  home to die. As the disease increased upon him, he composed himself for  his departure; and calling upon Dr. Birch to give him the holy sacrament,  he desired his children to take it with him, and made an earnest  declaration of his faith in Christianity. It now appeared what part of his  conversation with the great could be remembered with delight. He related,  that being present when the Duke of Buckingham talked profanely before  King Charles, he said to him, 'My lord, I am a great deal older than your  Grace, and have, I believe, heard more arguments for atheism than ever  your Grace did; but I have lived long enough to see there is nothing in  them, and so I hope your Grace will.\"          [5] Johnson's Life of Waller, wherein the poet is stated to have          been born March 3.           *       *       *       *       *            SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.
