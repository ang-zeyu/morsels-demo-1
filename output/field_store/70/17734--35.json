Psalm 4:2. 3 4 5 8. C. M.  An evening Psalm.    1 Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray  I am for ever thine:  I fear before thee all the day,  Nor would I dare to sin.    2 And while I rest my weary head  From cares and business free,  'Tis sweet conversing on my bed  With my own heart and thee.    3 I pay this evening sacrifice;  And when my work is done,  Great God, my faith and hope relies  Upon thy grace alone.    4 Thus with my thoughts compos'd to peace  I'll give mine eyes to sleep;  Thy hand in safety keeps my days,  And will my slumbers keep.      Psalm 5.  For the Lord's day morning.    1 Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear  My voice ascending high;  To thee will I direct my prayer,  To thee lift up mine eye;    2 Up to the hills where Christ is gone  To plead for all his saints,  Presenting at his Father's throne  Our songs and our complaints.    3 Thou art a God before whose sight  The wicked shall not stand;  Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight,  Nor dwell at thy right hand.    4 But to thy house will I resort,  To taste thy mercies there;  I will frequent thine holy court,  And worship in thy fear.    5 O may thy Spirit guide my feet  In ways of righteousness!  Make every path of duty straight  And plain before my face.    PAUSE.    6 My watchful enemies combine  To tempt my feet astray;  They flatter with a base design  To make my soul their prey.    7 Lord, crush the serpent in the dust,  And all his plots destroy;  While those that in thy mercy trust  For ever shout for joy.    8 The men that love and fear thy name  Shall see their hopes fulfill'd;  The mighty God will compass them  With favour as a shield.      Psalm 6:1. C. M.  Complaint in sickness;  or, diseases healed.    1 In anger, Lord, rebuke me not,  Withdraw the dreadful storm;  Nor let thy fury grow so hot  Against a feeble worm.    2 My soul's bow'd down with heavy cares,  My flesh with pain oppress'd;  My couch is witness to my tears,  My tears forbid my rest.    3 Sorrow and pain wear out my days;  I waste the night with cries,  Counting the minutes as they pass,  Till the slow morning rise.    4 Shall I be still tormented more?  Mine eye consum'd with grief?  How long, my God, how long before  Thine hand afford relief?    5 He hears when dust and ashes speak,  He pities all our groans,  He saves us for his mercy's sake  And heals our broken bones.    6 The virtue of his sovereign word  Restores our fainting breath;  For silent graves praise not the Lord,  Nor is he known in death.      Psalm 6:2. L. M.  Temptations in sickness overcome.    1 Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes,  When thou with kindness dost chastise  But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear,  O let it not against me rise!    2 Pity my languishing estate,  And ease the sorrows that I feel;  The wounds thine heavy hand hath made,  O let thy gentler touches heal.    3 See how I pass my weary days  In sighs and groans; and when 'tis night  My bed is water'd with my tears;  My grief consumes and dims my sight.    4 Look how the powers of nature mourn!  How long, almighty God, how long?  When shall thine hour of grace return?  When shall I make thy grace my song?    5 I feel my flesh so near the grave,  My thoughts are tempted to despair;  But graves can never praise the Lord,  For all is dust and silence there.    6 Depart, ye tempters, from my soul,  And all despairing thoughts depart;  My God, who hears my humble moan,  Will ease my flesh, and cheer my heart.      Psalm 7.  God's care of his people and  punishment of persecutors.    1 My trust is in my heavenly Friend,  My hope in thee, my God;  Rise and my helpless life defend  From those that seek my blood.    2 With insolence and fury they  My soul in pieces tear,  As hungry lions rend the prey  When no deliverer's near.    3 If I had e'er provok'd them first,  Or once abus'd my foe,  Then let him tread my life to dust,  And lay mine honour low.    4 If there be malice found in me,  I know thy piercing eyes;  I should not dare appeal to thee,  Nor ask my God to rise.    5 Arise, my God, lift up thy hand,  Their pride and power control;  Awake to judgment and command  Deliverance for my soul.    PAUSE.    6 [Let sinners and their wicked rage  Be humbled to the dust;  Shall not the God of truth engage  To vindicate the just?    7 He knows the heart, he tries the reins,  He will defend th' upright:  His sharpest arrows he ordains  Against the sons of spite.    8 For me their malice digg'd a pit,  But there themselves are cast;  My God makes all their mischief light  On their own heads at last.]    9 That cruel persecuting race  Must feel his dreadful sword;  Awake, my soul, and praise the grace  And justice of the Lord.      Psalm 8:1. S. M.  God's sovereignty and goodness; and  man's dominion over the creatures.    1 O Lord, our heavenly King,  Thy name is all divine;  Thy glories round the earth are spread,  And o'er the heavens they shine.    2 When to thy works on high  I raise my wondering eyes,  And see the moon complete in light  Adorn the darksome skies:    3 When I survey the stars,  And all their shining forms,  Lord, what is man, that worthless thing,  Akin to dust and worms?    4 Lord, what is worthless man,  That thou shouldst love him so?  Next to thine angels he is plac'd,  And lord of all below.    5 Thine honours crown his head,  While beasts like slaves obey,  And birds that cut the air with wings,  And fish that cleave the sea.    6 How rich thy bounties are!  And wondrous are thy ways:  Of dust and worms thy power can frame  A monument of praise.    7 [Out of the mouths of babes  And sucklings thou canst draw  Surprising honours to thy name,  And strike the world with awe.]    8 O Lord, our heavenly King,  Thy name is all divine:  Thy glories round the earth are spread,  And o'er the heavens they shine.      Psalm 8:2. C. M.  Christ's condescension and  glorification; or, God made man.    1 O Lord, our Lord, how wondrous great  Is thine exalted name!  The glories of thy heavenly state  Let men and babes proclaim.    2 When I behold thy works on high,  The moon that rules the night,  And stars that well adorn the sky,  Those moving worlds of light;    3 Lord, what is man, or all his race,  Who dwells so far below,  That thou shouldst visit him with grace,  And love his nature so?    4 That thine eternal Son should bear  To take a mortal form,  Made lower than his angels are,  To save a dying worm!    5 [Yet while he liv'd on earth unknown,  And men would not adore,  Th' obedient seas and fishes own  His Godhead and his power.    6 The waves lay spread beneath his feet;  And fish, at his command,  Bring their large shoals to Peter's net,  Bring tribute to his hand.    7 These lesser glories of the Son  Shone thro' the fleshly cloud;  Now we behold him on his throne,  And men confess him God.]    8 Let him be crown'd with majesty,  Who bow'd his head to death;  And be his honours sounded high,  By all things that have breath.    9 Jesus, our Lord, how wondrous great  Is thine exalted name!  The glories of thy heavenly state  Let the whole earth proclaim.      Psalm 8:3. 1 2. paraphrased.  First Part. L. M.  The Hosanna of the children;  or, Infants praising God.    1 Almighty Ruler of the skies,  Thro' the wide earth thy name is spread,  And thine eternal glories rise  O'er all the heavens thy hands have made.    2 To thee the voices of the young  A monument of honour raise;  And babes, with uninstructed tongue,  Declare the wonders of thy praise.    3 Thy power assists their tender age  To bring proud rebels to the ground,  To still the bold blasphemer's rage,  And all their policies confound.    4 Children amidst thy temple throng  To see their great Redeemer's face;  The Son of David is their song,  And young hosannas fill the place.    3 The frowning scribes and angry priests  In vain their impious cavils bring;  Revenge sits silent in their breasts,  While Jewish babes proclaim their king.      Psalm 8:4. 3 &c. paraphrased.  Second Part. L. M.  Adam and Christ, lords of  the old and the new creation.    1 Lord, what was man, when made at first,  Adam the offspring of the dust,  That thou shouldst set him and his race  But just below an angel's place?    2 That thou shouldst raise his nature so  And make him lord of all below;  Make every beast and bird submit,  And lay the fishes at his feet?    3 But O, what brighter glories wait  To crown the second Adam's state!  What honours shall thy Son adorn  Who condescended to be born!    4 See him below his angels made,  See him in dust amongst the dead,  To save a ruin'd world from sin;  But he shall reign with power divine.    5 The world to come, redeem'd from all  The miseries that attend the fall,  New made, and glorious, shall submit  At our exalted Saviour's feet.      Psalm 9:1. First Part.  Wrath and mercy from the judgment-seat.    1 With my whole heart I'll raise my song,  Thy wonders I'll proclaim;  Thou sov'reign judge of right and wrong  Wilt put my foes to shame.    2 I'll sing thy majesty and grace;  My God prepares his throne  To judge the world in righteousness  And make his vengeance known.    3 Then shall the Lord a refuge prove  For all the poor opprest,  To save the people of his love,  And give the weary rest.    4 The men, that know thy name will trust  In thy abundant grace;  For thou hast ne'er forsook the just,  Who humbly seek thy face.    5 Sing praises to the righteous Lord,  Who dwells on Zion's hill,  Who executes his threatening word,  And doth his grace fulfil.      Psalm 9:2. 10. Second Part.  The wisdom and equity of providence.    1 When the great Judge, supreme and just,  Shall once inquire for blood,  The humble souls, that mourn in dust,  Shall find a faithful God.    2 He from the dreadful gates of death  Does his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#4)"],[1,"story with a certain winsome naivete which carried an air of  semi-probability with it. From her deportment on the stand one would  have taken her for a boarding school miss who in some inconsequent  fashion had got mixed up in a frolic for which no really logical  explanation could be given.    Then the door in the back of the court room opened and James Parker was  led to the bar, where in the presence of the jury he pleaded guilty to  the forgery of the very signature for which his wife was standing trial.  (Kauser check, Fig. 6.) He was then sworn as a witness, took the stand  and testified that _he_ had written all the forged signatures to the  checks, including the signatures upon \"the Peabody sheet.\"    The District Attorney found himself in an embarrassing position. If  Parker was the forger, why not challenge him to write the forged  signatures upon the witness stand and thus to prove his alleged capacity  for so doing? The obvious objection to this was that Parker, in  anticipation of this test, had probably been practicing the signature in  the Tombs for months. On the other hand if the District Attorney did not  challenge him to write the signatures, the defense would argue that he  was afraid to do so, and that as Parker had sworn himself to be the  forger it was not incumbent upon the defense to prove it further--that  that was a matter for cross examination.    With considerable hesitation the prosecuting attorney asked Parker to  write the Kauser signature, which was the one set forth in the  indictment charging the forgery, and after much backing and filling on  the part of the witness, who ingeniously complained that he was in a bad  nervous condition owing to lack of morphine, in consequence of which his  hand trembled and he was in no condition to write forgeries, the latter  took his pen and managed to make a very fair copy of the Kauser  signature from memory, good enough in fact to warrant a jury in forming  the conclusion that he was in fact the forger. (Fig. 7.) This closed the  case.    The defense claimed that it was clear that James Parker was the forger,  since he had admitted it in open court, pleaded guilty to the indictment  and proved that he had the capacity. The prosecution, upon the other  hand, argued that the evidence was conclusive that the defendant herself  was the writer of the check. The whole thing boiled down to whether or  not the jury was going to believe that Mrs. Parker had written \"the  Peabody sheet\" in the presence of the detective, when her husband  claimed that, with the exception of Mabel's signature, he had done it  himself and carelessly left the paper in his desk in the room.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Parker's copy of the signature of Alice Kauser,  made in court in an attempt to shield his wife.]    The prosecuting attorney was at his wits' end for an argument to meet  the fact that Parker had written a sample forgery of the Kauser  signature before the very eyes of the jury. He found it at last in an  offer on his own part in open court during his \"summing up\" to write for  the jury from memory a better forgery of the Kauser signature than that  written by Parker himself, and thus to show how simple a matter it was  to learn to do so. He had taken up his pen and was about to give a  sample of his handiwork in this respect when the defendant grasped her  counsel's arm and whispered: \"For God's sake, don't let him do it!\"  whereupon the lawyer arose and objected, saying that such evidence was  improper, as the case was closed. As might have been expected under the  circumstances, considering the blunders of the prosecution and the  ingenuous appearance of the defendant, the trial ended in a  disagreement, the jury standing eight to four for acquittal.    The District Attorney's office now took up a thorough investigation of  the case, with the result that on a second prosecution Mrs. Parker was  confronted with a mass of evidence which it was impossible for her to  refute. A boy named Wallace Sweeney, sentenced to the Elmira  Reformatory, was found to have been an active accomplice of the Parkers  for several years, and he was accordingly brought down to New York,  where he gave a complete history of his relations with them. His story  proved beyond any doubt that Mrs. Parker was the forger of the checks in  the possession of the District Attorney, and of many others beside, some  of them for very large amounts. The evidence of Sweeney was of itself  quite sufficient to warrant a conviction. To make assurance doubly sure,  however, the District Attorney upon the second trial moved a new  indictment, setting forth as the forgery a check signed \"E. Bierstadt,\"  so that when Parker took the stand, as he had done in the former trial  and testified that he was the forger, he found himself unable to write  this new signature, and hence his testimony went for nothing.    But even the testimony of Sweeney was that of an accomplice, requiring  corroboration, while that of Peabody remained the evidence of \"a mere  policeman,\" eager to convict the defendant and \"add another scalp to his  official belt.\" With an extraordinary accumulation of evidence the case  hinged on the veracity of these two men, to which was opposed the denial  of the defendant and her husband. It is an interesting fact that in the  final analysis of the case the jury were compelled to determine the  issue by evidence entirely documentary in character. It is also an  illustration of what tiny facts stamp whole masses of testimony as true  or false.    On her examination Mrs. Parker had sworn among other things: (1) That  she had no knowledge of the envelope, the back of which had been used by  Parker for the purpose of directing Rogers, Peet & Co. to deliver the  clothes and money to his messenger--and, of course, that the words \"Mr.  Geo. B. Lang\" were not in her handwriting. This was one of the envelopes  claimed by the prosecution to have been originally addressed in pencil  and sent to themselves by the Parkers through the mail for this precise  purpose. (2) That she had never seen the \"Kauser practice sheets,\" and  that the words \"Alice Kauser,\" repeated hundreds of times thereon, were  not in her handwriting. For some reason unknown to the District  Attorney, however, she admitted having written the words \"I am upstairs  in the bath-room\" upon a similar sheet, but claimed that at the time  this was done the reverse of the paper was entirely blank.    Microscopic examination showed that among the words \"Alice\" and \"Kauser\"  on the practice sheets some one had written a capital \"M.\" One of the  legs of the \"M\" crossed and was superimposed upon a letter in the word  \"Alice.\" Hence, whoever wrote the \"M\" knew what was on the practice  sheet. An enlargement of this \"M\" and a comparison of it with the \"M\" in  the defendant's signature to her formal examination in the police court,  with the \"M\" in \"_Mr._\" in the address on the envelope and with that in  the \"Mrs.\" on the \"Peabody sheet,\" rendered it obvious that they were  all written by one and the same hand. Therefore it was clear that the  defendant was familiar with the contents of the practice sheets (Fig.  8.), even if she had not written them herself and had not told the truth  in this regard.    Moreover, it was fairly easy to see that the same hand that had written  the words \"I am upstairs in the bath-room\" upon the second practice  sheet had at the same time and with the same pen written the rest of the  sheet. This was clearly perceptible on examining the \"e's\" and \"a's.\"    A comparison of the address \"Mr. Geo. B. Lang\" (on Fig. 1) with the name  Mrs. James D. Singley (on Fig. 4) also shows clearly that one and the  same person wrote them both. And to the accuracy of all these  self-evident propositions a leading handwriting expert in New York added  his unqualified opinion.    Thus, but for a little carelessness in failing to destroy odd scraps of  paper and to disguise her penmanship which it seemed to her quite  unnecessary to do, as in the address of the \"Lang\" envelope, Mrs. Parker  might well have gone free after all.    It is impossible to describe all the varied dramatic features of this  interesting case. No one who was present is likely to forget the  impression made by the defendant at her second trial, when in defiance  of overwhelming proof she still struggled to vindicate herself.    Her counsel contended throughout the trial that she was a hitherto  innocent young woman led astray and started upon a criminal career by a  rascally husband, whom she still loved devotedly and for whose sake  she had prepared to confess herself a criminal. That James Parker  introduced his wife to a life of crime there can be no doubt, but that  she had a natural predilection for it must be equally obvious. It is  probably true that Mabel Parker's affection for her convict husband was  unfeigned and deep. The natural repugnance of the American jury for  convicting a woman was shown when in spite of the overwhelming proof  upon the Parker woman's second trial the jury remained out eight hours  and then found her guilty of \"uttering only,\" with a strong  recommendation for mercy. She was sentenced to the Bedford Reformatory.
