For the right to vote is the great primitive right. It is the  right in which all freedom originates and culminates. It is the right  from which all others spring, in which they merge, and without which  they fall whenever assailed.    This right makes, and is all the difference between government by and  with the consent of the governed and government without and against  the consent of the governed; and that is the difference between  freedom and slavery. If the right to vote be not that difference, what  is? No, sir. If either sex as a class can dispense with the right to  vote, then take it from the strong, and no longer rob the weak of  their defense for the benefit of the strong.    But it is impossible to conceive of the suffrage as a right dependent  at all upon such an irrelevant condition as sex. It is an individual,  a personal right. It may be withheld by force; but if withheld by  reason of sex it is a moral robbery.    But it is said that the duties of maternity disqualify for the  performance of the act of voting. It can not be, and I think is not  claimed by any one, that the mother who otherwise would be fit to  vote is rendered mentally or morally less fit to exercise this high  function in the state because of motherhood. On the contrary, if any  woman has a motive more than another person, man or woman, to secure  the enactment and enforcement of good laws, it is the mother, who,  beside her own life, person, and property, to the protection of which  the ballot is as essential as to the same rights possessed by man,  has her little contingent of immortal beings to conduct safely to  the portals of active life through all the snares and pitfalls woven  around them by bad men and bad laws which bad men have made, or good  laws which bad men, unhindered by the good, have defied or have  prostituted, and rightly to prepare, them for the discharge of all the  duties of their day and generation, including the exercise of the very  right denied to their mother.    Certainly, if but for motherhood she should vote, then ten thousand  times more necessary is it that the mother should be guarded and armed  with this great social and political power for the sake of all men and  women who are yet to be. But it is said that she has not the time. Let  us see. By the best deductions I can make from the census and from  other sources there are 15,000,000 women of voting age in this country  at the present time, of whom not more than 10,000,000 are married and  not more than 7,500,000 are still liable to the duties of maternity,  for it will be remembered that a large proportion of the mothers of  our country at any given time are below the voting age, while of those  who are above it another large proportion have passed beyond the point  of this objection. Not more than one-half the female population of  voting age are liable to this objection. Then why disfranchise the  7,500,000, the other half, as to whom your objection, even if valid  as to any, does not apply at all; and these, too, as a class the most  mature and therefore the best qualified to vote of any of their sex?  But how much is there of this objection of want of time or physical  strength to vote, in its application to women who are bearing and  training the coming millions? The families of the country average five  persons in number. If we assume that this gives an average of three  children to every pair, which is probably the full number, or if we  assume that every married mother, after she becomes of voting age,  bears three children, which is certainly the full allowance, and that  twenty-four years are consumed in doing it, there is one child born  every eight years whose coming is to interfere with the exercise of a  duty of privilege which, in most States, and in all the most important  elections, occurs only one day in two years.    That same mother will attend church at least forty times yearly on  the average from her cradle to her grave, beside an infinity of other  social, religious, and industrial obligations which she performs and  assumes to perform because she is a married woman and a mother rather  than for any other reason whatever. Yet it is proposed to deprive  women--yes, all women alike--of an inestimable privilege and the chief  power which can be exercised by any free individual in the state for  the reason that on any given day of election not more than one woman  in twenty of voting age will probably not be able to reach the polls.  It does seem probable that on these interesting occasions if the  husband and wife disagree in politics they could arrange a pair, and  the probability is, that arrangement failing, one could be consummated  with some other lady in like fortunate circumstances, of opposite  political opinions. More men are kept from the polls by drunkenness,  or, being at the polls, vote under the influence of strong drink, to  the reproach and destruction of our free institutions, and who, if  woman could and did vote, would cast the ballot of sobriety, good  order, and reform under her holy influences, than all those who would  be kept from any given election by the necessary engagements of  mothers at home.    When one thinks of the innumerable and trifling causes which keep many  of the best of men and strongest opponents of woman suffrage from the  polls upon important occasions it is difficult to be tolerant of the  objection that woman by reason of motherhood has no time to vote. Why,  sir, the greater exposure of man to the casualties of life actually  disables him in such way as to make it physically impossible for him  to exercise the franchise more frequently than is the case with  women, including mothers and all. And if this liability to lose the  opportunity to exercise the right once or possibly twice in a lifetime  is a reason that women should not he allowed to vote at all, why  should men not be disfranchised also by the same rule?    But it is urged that woman does not desire the privilege. If the right  exist at all it is an individual right, and not one which belongs to a  class or to the sex as such. Yet men tell us that they will vote the  suffrage to women whenever the majority of women desire it. Are, then,  our rights the property of the majority of a disfranchised class to  which we may chance to belong? What would we say if it were seriously  proposed to recall the suffrage from all colored or from all white men  because a majority of either class should decline or for any cause  fail to vote? I know that it is said that the suffrage is a privilege  to be extended by those who have it to those who have it not. But the  matter of right, of moral right, to the franchise does not depend  upon the indifference of those who possess it or of those who do not  possess it to the desire of those women who desire to enjoy their  right and to discharge their duty. If one or many choose not to claim  their right it is no argument for depriving me of mine or one woman of  hers. There are many reasons why some women declare themselves opposed  to the extension of suffrage to their sex. Some well-fed and pampered,  without serious experiences in life, are incapable of comprehending  the subject at all. Vast numbers, who secretly and earnestly desire it  from the long habit of deference to the wishes of the other sex, upon  whom they are so entirely dependent while disfranchised, and knowing  the hostility of their \"protectors\" to the agitation of the subject,  conceal their real sentiments, and the \"lord\" of the family referring  this question to his wife, who has heard him sneer or worse than sneer  at suffragists for half a lifetime, ought not to expect an answer  which she knows will subject her to his censure and ridicule or even  his unexpressed disapprobation.    It is like the old appeal of the master to his slave to know if  he would be free. Full well did the wise and wary slave know that  happiness depended upon declared contentment with his lot. But all  the same the world does move. Colored men are free. Colored men vote.  Women will vote. A little further on I shall revert to the evidence of  a general and growing desire on her part and on the part of just and  intelligent men that the suffrage be extended to women.    But we are told that husband and wife will disagree and thus the  suffrage will destroy the family and ruin society. If a married  couple will quarrel at all, they will find the occasion, and it were  fortunate indeed if their contention might concern important affairs.  There is no peace in the family save where love is, and the same  spirit which enables the husband and wife to enforce the toleration  act between themselves in religious matters will keep the peace  between them in political discussions. At all events, this argument  is unworthy of notice at all unless we are to push it to its logical  conclusion, and, for the sake of peace in the family, to prohibit  woman absolutely the exercise of freedom of thought and speech.  Men live with their countrymen and disagree with them in politics,  religion, and ten thousand of the affairs of life, as often the  trifling as the important. What harm, then, if woman be allowed her  thought and vote upon the tariff, education, temperance, peace and  war, and whatsoever else the suffrage decides?    But we are told that no government, of which we have authentic  history, ever gave to woman a share in the sovereignty.    This is not true, for the annals of monarchies and despotisms have  been rendered illustrious by queens of surpassing brilliance and  power. But even if it be true that no republic ever enfranchised woman  with the ballot--even so until within one hundred years universal or  even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#4)"],[1,"in one of the little groups.  \"Diamond is mad enough to do as he threatens.\"    \"Sure,\" nodded another. \"And that breaks up this joint. No more little  lunches here--no more games of penny ante.\"    \"It's a howling shame!\" exploded a third. \"It makes me feel grouchy.\"    \"I move we strangle Diamond,\" suggested the first speaker.    \"It seems that that is the only way to keep his tongue still,\" dolefully  groaned a tall chap. \"This is a big horse on us.\"    \"That's what,\" sighed a boy with a face like a girl's. \"The whole  business puts me in a blue funk.\"    Then they stood and stared silently at each other through the eyeholes  in their masks, and not one of them was able to propose anything  practicable.    The rest of the assembled sophomores seemed in quite as bad a plight,  and some of them were inclined to indulge in profanity, which, although  it relieved their feelings for the moment, did not suggest any way out  of the scrape.    At this point Merriwell spoke up, addressing Diamond.    \"Look here, old man,\" he said in a friendly way, \"you've only taken the  same dose they gave me. It's nothing when you get used to it.\"    Diamond gave him a contemptuous look, but did not speak.    \"Now, I don't propose to make a fuss about this little joke,\" Frank went  on. \"What's the use? I'm not half killed.\"    \"Perhaps you think you can hoodwink me!\" cried Diamond. \"Well, you  cannot! You were in the game all the time. That's why you were so ready  to meet me in a duel--that's why you came here.\"    \"I assure you on my word of honor that you are wrong.\"    \"Your word of honor!\"    \"Yes, my word of honor,\" he calmly returned. \"See--look at my clothes.  You can tell that I have been through the mill.\"    \"You may have had them fixed that way on purpose to fool me.\"    \"Oh, you must know better than that! Be reasonable, Diamond.\"    The Virginian made a savage gesture.    \"If you are so pleased to be made a laughingstock of it's nothing to  me,\" he flashed. \"Keep still if you want to. I'm going to tell all I  know.\"    \"That would make a very large book--full of nice clean, blank pages,\"  said some one in the background.    Frank's manner suddenly changed.    \"Look here, Diamond,\" he said, \"you won't tell a thing.\"    The Southerner caught his breath and his eyes stared.    \"Eh?\" he muttered, surprised at the other's manner. \"I won't?\"    \"Not on your life.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because it will mean expulsion for you as well as myself if you do.\"    Every one was listening. They gathered about the two freshmen, wondering  not a little at Merriwell's words and manner.    \"Expulsion for me?\" slowly repeated Diamond. \"How is that?\"    \"It's straight goods.\"    \"Explain it.\"    \"Well, I will. We came here to fight a duel, didn't we?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You admit that?\"    \"I do, sir.\"    \"That is all that's needed.\"    \"How? Why? I don't understand.\"    \"Duels are not countenanced in the North, and nothing would cause a  fellow to be fired from Yale quicker than the knowledge that he had had  anything to do with one while here. Do you twig?\"    There was a moment of silence and then a stir. A deep sigh of relief  came from the masked lads, and some of them showed an inclination to  cheer Merriwell.    Diamond seemed nonplused for the moment. He glared at Frank, his hands  clinched and his face pale.    At last he slowly said:    \"A duel is something no gentleman can blow about, so if you are a  gentleman you will have to remain silent, sir.\"    \"That's the way you Southerners look at it, but yon will excuse us  Northerners if we do not see it in the same light. A hazing is something  we do not blow about, but you seem determined to let out everything, for  all that it would be a dirty thing to do. In order to even the matter,  these fellows are sure to tell that you came here to fight a duel with  deadly weapons, and you'll find yourself rusticating in Virginia  directly.\"    \"'Way down in ole Virginny,\" softly warbled one of the delighted  sophomores. \"That's the stuff, Merry, old boy!\"    Diamond trembled with intense anger. He tried to speak, but his voice  was so hoarse that his words were unintelligible. A blue line seemed to  form around his mouth.    \"Merriwell's got him!\" Bruce Brown lazily whispered in Tad Horner's ear.  \"See him squirm!\"    Tad was relieved, although he endeavored not to show it; but a satisfied  smile crept over his rosy face, and he felt like giving Frank Merriwell  the \"glad hand.\"    Diamond's anger got the best of him. He strode forward, looked straight  into Frank's eyes, and panted:    \"I hate you, sir! I could kill you!\"    And then, before he realized what he was doing, he struck Merriwell a  sharp blow on the cheek with his open hand.          CHAPTER IV.    THE FIGHT.      The blow staggered Frank. It had come so suddenly that he was quite  unprepared for it. His face became suddenly pale, save where Diamond's  hand had struck, and there the crimson prints of four fingers came out  quickly, like a danger signal.    With the utmost deliberation Merriwell removed his coat.    \"Come, sir!\" he said to Diamond as he passed coat and hat to a ready  sophomore.    \"I--I can't fight you that way!\" protested the Virginian. \"Bring the  rapiers.\"    \"This time I claim the right to name the weapons, and they will be bare  fists.\"    \"Right! right!\" cried several voices. \"You'll have to fight him that  way, Diamond.\"    \"I will fight him!\" grated Jack, furiously. \"It is the prize fighter's  way, but I'll fight him, and I will lick him!\"    He tore off his coat and flung it down. The boys quickly formed a ring,  and the freshmen foes faced each other.    Then the door of the room where the other freshmen were confined was  thrust open, and Harry Rattleton excitedly cried:    \"Whee jiz--I mean jee whiz! what do you fellows think? Do you imagine we  are going to stay penned in here while there is a scrap going on? Well,  I guess not! We're coming out!\"    Harry came with a rush, and the other freshmen followed at his heels,  the party having been abandoned by the sophs who had been placed on  guard over them.    \"Hold on! hold on!\" commanded Harry, forcing his way toward the  fighters. \"I am Merriwell's second, and I'm going to see fair play, you  bet!\"    \"And I am Diamond's second,\" said Roland Ditson. \"Just give me a chance  in the ring there.\"    The appearance of the freshmen caused a brief delay. There was some talk  about rules and rounds, and Diamond said:    \"If I must fight with my fists, I'll fight as I please. I don't know  about your rules, and there will be but one round--that will finish it.\"    \"How does that suit you, Merriwell?\" asked Tad Horner, who seemed to  have assumed the position of referee.    \"I am willing that Mr. Diamond should arrange that matter to suit  himself.\"    \"But there is to be no kicking,\" Tad Horner hastily put in.    \"Certainly not,\" stiffly agreed the Southerner.    \"All right. Shake hands.\"    Diamond placed both hands behind his back, and Merriwell laughed.    \"Ready!\" called Horner. \"On guard! Now you're off!\"    Barely had the words left the little referee's lips when--top, tap,  slap!--Merriwell had struck Diamond three light blows with his open  hand.    A gasp of astonishment came from the watching sophomores. Never had they  seen three blows delivered in such lightning-like rapidity, but their  ears had not fooled them, and they heard each blow distinctly.    Merriwell's guard was perfect, his pose was light and professional, and  he suddenly seemed catlike on his feet.    Diamond was astonished, but only for an instant. The tapping blows  started his blood, and he sprang toward his foe, striking out with his  left and then with his right.    Merriwell did not attempt to guard, but he dodged both blows with ease,  and then smiled sweetly into the face of the baffled Virginian.    \"Oh, say!\" chuckled Harry Rattleton, hugging himself in delighted  anticipation, \"just you fellows wait a minute! Diamond will think he has  been struck by an earthquake!\"    Bruce Browning, himself a scientific boxer, was watching every movement  of the two freshmen. He turned to Puss Parker at his side and said:    \"Merriwell handles himself like an old professional. By Jove! I believe  there's good stuff in that fellow!\"    \"Diamond would like to kill Merriwell,\" said Parker. \"You can see it in  his face and eyes.\"    In truth there was a deadly look in the eyes of the pale-faced young  Virginian. His lips were pressed together, and a hardening of the jaws  told that his teeth were set. He was following Merriwell up, and the  latter was avoiding him with ease. Plainly Diamond meant to corner the  lad he hated and then force the fighting to a finish.    The rivals were nearly of a height and they wore built much alike,  although Frank had slightly the better chest development.    Merriwell seemed to toy with Diamond, giving him several little pat-like  blows on the breast and in the ribs. When the Virginian felt that he had  Frank cornered he was astonished to see Merriwell slip under his arm and  come up laughing behind him.    Merriwell's laughter filled Diamond's very soul with gall and wormwood.    \"Wait!\" he thought. \"He laughs best who laughs last.\"    \"Give it to him, Frank!\" urged Rattleton. \"You'll get out of wind  dodging about, and then it will not be so easy to finish him off.\"    But Frank saw that in a scientific way Diamond was no match for him, and  he disliked to strike the fellow. He regretted very much that the  unfortunate affair had come about, and he felt that there could be no  satisfaction in whipping the Southerner.    Merriwell hoped to toy with Diamond till the latter should see that his  efforts were fruitless and give up in disgust.    But he did not yet recognize the kind of stuff of which John Diamond was  built.    \"Come! come!\" impatiently called one of the spectators. \"Quit ducking  and dodging and get into the game.\"    \"That's right!"]]]
