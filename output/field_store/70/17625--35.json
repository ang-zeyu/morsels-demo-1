And such an existence is even now the lot of many, during  some considerable portion of their lives. The present wretched  education, and wretched social arrangements, are the only real hindrance  to its being attainable by almost all.    The objectors perhaps may doubt whether human beings, if taught to  consider happiness as the end of life, would be satisfied with such a  moderate share of it. But great numbers of mankind have been satisfied  with much less. The main constituents of a satisfied life appear to be  two, either of which by itself is often found sufficient for the  purpose: tranquillity, and excitement. With much tranquillity, many find  that they can be content with very little pleasure: with much  excitement, many can reconcile themselves to a considerable quantity of  pain. There is assuredly no inherent impossibility in enabling even the  mass of mankind to unite both; since the two are so far from being  incompatible that they are in natural alliance, the prolongation of  either being a preparation for, and exciting a wish for, the other. It  is only those in whom indolence amounts to a vice, that do not desire  excitement after an interval of repose; it is only those in whom the  need of excitement is a disease, that feel the tranquillity which  follows excitement dull and insipid, instead of pleasurable in direct  proportion to the excitement which preceded it. When people who are  tolerably fortunate in their outward lot do not find in life sufficient  enjoyment to make it valuable to them, the cause generally is, caring  for nobody but themselves. To those who have neither public nor private  affections, the excitements of life are much curtailed, and in any case  dwindle in value as the time approaches when all selfish interests must  be terminated by death: while those who leave after them objects of  personal affection, and especially those who have also cultivated a  fellow-feeling with the collective interests of mankind, retain as  lively an interest in life on the eve of death as in the vigour of youth  and health. Next to selfishness, the principal cause which makes life  unsatisfactory, is want of mental cultivation. A cultivated mind--I do  not mean that of a philosopher, but any mind to which the fountains of  knowledge have been opened, and which has been taught, in any tolerable  degree, to exercise its faculties--finds sources of inexhaustible  interest in all that surrounds it; in the objects of nature, the  achievements of art, the imaginations of poetry, the incidents of  history, the ways of mankind past and present, and their prospects in  the future. It is possible, indeed, to become indifferent to all this,  and that too without having exhausted a thousandth part of it; but only  when one has had from the beginning no moral or human interest in these  things, and has sought in them only the gratification of curiosity.    Now there is absolutely no reason in the nature of things why an amount  of mental culture sufficient to give an intelligent interest in these  objects of contemplation, should not be the inheritance of every one  born in a civilized country. As little is there an inherent necessity  that any human being should be a selfish egotist, devoid of every  feeling or care but those which centre in his own miserable  individuality. Something far superior to this is sufficiently common  even now, to give ample earnest of what the human species may be made.  Genuine private affections, and a sincere interest in the public good,  are possible, though in unequal degrees, to every rightly brought-up  human being. In a world in which there is so much to interest, so much  to enjoy, and so much also to correct and improve, every one who has  this moderate amount of moral and intellectual requisites is capable of  an existence which may be called enviable; and unless such a person,  through bad laws, or subjection to the will of others, is denied the  liberty to use the sources of happiness within his reach, he will not  fail to find this enviable existence, if he escape the positive evils of  life, the great sources of physical and mental suffering--such as  indigence, disease, and the unkindness, worthlessness, or premature loss  of objects of affection. The main stress of the problem lies, therefore,  in the contest with these calamities, from which it is a rare good  fortune entirely to escape; which, as things now are, cannot be  obviated, and often cannot be in any material degree mitigated. Yet no  one whose opinion deserves a moment's consideration can doubt that most  of the great positive evils of the world are in themselves removable,  and will, if human affairs continue to improve, be in the end reduced  within narrow limits. Poverty, in any sense implying suffering, may be  completely extinguished by the wisdom of society, combined with the good  sense and providence of individuals. Even that most intractable of  enemies, disease, may be indefinitely reduced in dimensions by good  physical and moral education, and proper control of noxious influences;  while the progress of science holds out a promise for the future of  still more direct conquests over this detestable foe. And every advance  in that direction relieves us from some, not only of the chances which  cut short our own lives, but, what concerns us still more, which deprive  us of those in whom our happiness is wrapt up. As for vicissitudes of  fortune, and other disappointments connected with worldly circumstances,  these are principally the effect either of gross imprudence, of  ill-regulated desires, or of bad or imperfect social institutions. All  the grand sources, in short, of human suffering are in a great degree,  many of them almost entirely, conquerable by human care and effort; and  though their removal is grievously slow--though a long succession of  generations will perish in the breach before the conquest is completed,  and this world becomes all that, if will and knowledge were not wanting,  it might easily be made--yet every mind sufficiently intelligent and  generous to bear a part, however small and unconspicuous, in the  endeavour, will draw a noble enjoyment from the contest itself, which he  would not for any bribe in the form of selfish indulgence consent to be  without.    And this leads to the true estimation of what is said by the objectors  concerning the possibility, and the obligation, of learning to do  without happiness. Unquestionably it is possible to do without  happiness; it is done involuntarily by nineteen-twentieths of mankind,  even in those parts of our present world which are least deep in  barbarism; and it often has to be done voluntarily by the hero or the  martyr, for the sake of something which he prizes more than his  individual happiness. But this something, what is it, unless the  happiness of others, or some of the requisites of happiness? It is noble  to be capable of resigning entirely one's own portion of happiness, or  chances of it: but, after all, this self-sacrifice must be for some end;  it is not its own end; and if we are told that its end is not happiness,  but virtue, which is better than happiness, I ask, would the sacrifice  be made if the hero or martyr did not believe that it would earn for  others immunity from similar sacrifices? Would it be made, if he thought  that his renunciation of happiness for himself would produce no fruit  for any of his fellow creatures, but to make their lot like his, and  place them also in the condition of persons who have renounced  happiness? All honour to those who can abnegate for themselves the  personal enjoyment of life, when by such renunciation they contribute  worthily to increase the amount of happiness in the world; but he who  does it, or professes to do it, for any other purpose, is no more  deserving of admiration than the ascetic mounted on his pillar. He may  be an inspiriting proof of what men _can_ do, but assuredly not an  example of what they _should_.    Though it is only in a very imperfect state of the world's arrangements  that any one can best serve the happiness of others by the absolute  sacrifice of his own, yet so long as the world is in that imperfect  state, I fully acknowledge that the readiness to make such a sacrifice  is the highest virtue which can be found in man. I will add, that in  this condition of the world, paradoxical as the assertion may be, the  conscious ability to do without happiness gives the best prospect of  realizing such happiness as is attainable. For nothing except that  consciousness can raise a person above the chances of life, by making  him feel that, let fate and fortune do their worst, they have not power  to subdue him: which, once felt, frees him from excess of anxiety  concerning the evils of life, and enables him, like many a Stoic in the  worst times of the Roman Empire, to cultivate in tranquillity the  sources of satisfaction accessible to him, without concerning himself  about the uncertainty of their duration, any more than about their  inevitable end.    Meanwhile, let utilitarians never cease to claim the morality of  self-devotion as a possession which belongs by as good a right to them,  as either to the Stoic or to the Transcendentalist. The utilitarian  morality does recognise in human beings the power of sacrificing their  own greatest good for the good of others. It only refuses to admit that  the sacrifice is itself a good. A sacrifice which does not increase, or  tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.  The only self-renunciation which it applauds, is devotion to the  happiness, or to some of the means of happiness, of others; either of  mankind collectively, or of individuals within the limits imposed by the  collective interests of mankind.    I must again repeat, what the assailants of utilitarianism seldom have  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11233"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Unhappy, surrounded only by a few pious nuns, and urged by her  confessor, she renounced the religion of Mahomet, and became a  Christian. At length, in December, 1818, an Indian Sheik, named Goolam,  arrived in Paris, with instructions to claim the Princess Aline from the  Court of France. The Envoy sought out the Sultana: he informed her, that  her relations were desirous of her return; that she should be reinstated  in the rank which was her right, and again behold the bright sun and the  beautiful face of her own Asia, upon the sole condition that she would  forsake Christ for Mahomet. No persuasions, however, could prevail upon  the convert to comply with this requisition; Goolam went back to India  without accomplishing the object of his mission, which produced no  improvement in her straitened circumstances. Two years afterwards, she  learned that an Indian Prince had landed in England with a splendid  retinue, including three females, but that he had been obliged by the  English government to embark again immediately for India. Aline had no  doubt that this event had some connexion with her history, but she  heard no more of the matter.    These particulars are chiefly extracted from the preface to the books  of the Princess, written by the Marquess de Fortia. This nobleman  generously took upon himself the charge of supporting Aline, who has  now attained the age of sixty years in a foreign land.--_Court  Journal_.           *       *       *       *       *      MAKING PUNCH.      (_From the Noctes--Blackwood_.)    _Shepherd_.--I hae mony a time thocht it took as muckle natural  genius to mak a jug of punch as an epic poem, sic as Paradise Lost, or  even Queen Hynde hersell.    _Odoherty_.--More, my friend, more. I think an ingenious comparison  between these works of intellect could be easily made by a man of a  metaphysical turn of mind.    _North_.--A more interesting consideration would be, the effect  produced upon the national character, by the mere circumstance of the  modes of preparing the different beverages of different countries. Much  of the acknowledged inferiority of the inhabitants of wine countries,  arises from the circumstance of having their liquor prepared to their  hand. There is no stretch of imagination in pouring wine ready made from  carafe, or barochio, or flask, into a glass--the operation is merely  mechanical; whereas, among us punch drinkers, the necessity of a nightly  manufacture of a most intricate kind, calls forth habits of industry and  forethought--induces a taste for chemical experiment--improves us in  hygrometry, and many other sciences--to say nothing of the geographical  reflections drawn forth by the pressure of the lemon, or the colonial  questions, which press upon every meditative mind on the appearance of  white sugar.

Hand me a segar.    _Moses Edrehi_.--Yo suis of Madoc.    _North (aside.)_--Zounds! _(to Edrehi)_ I never chanced to  pass that way--the emperor and I were not on good terms.    _Moses Edrehi_.--Then, sare, you was good luck to no pass, for the  emperor was a man ver disagreeable ven no gut humours. Gott keep ush! He  hat lions in cage--and him gab peoples zu de lions--dey roarsh--oh,  mucho, mucho!--and eats de poor peoples--Gott keep ush! a ver  disagreeable man dat emperor.    _Shepherd_.--Nae doot--it canna be a pleasant thing to be gobbled  by a lion. Oh, sirs, imagine yoursell daundering out to Canaan, to take  your kail wi' our frien' James, and as ye're passing the Links, out  jumps a lion, and at you!    _Odoherty_.--The Links--oh! James, you are no Polyglott.    _Tickler_.--I don't wish to insinuate that I should like to be  eaten, either by lion or shepherd, but I confess that I consider that  the new drop would be a worse fate than either.    _North_.--Quite mistaken--the drop's a trifle.    _Moses Edrehi_.--Ja whoel, Milord.    _Shepherd_.--As to being hangit, why, that's a matter that happens  to mony a deacent man, and it's but a spurl or tway, and a gaspin  gurble, an' ae stour heave, and a's ower; ye're dead ere a body's weel  certified that the board's awa' from behind you--and the night-cap's a  great blessing, baith to you and the company.

You are seated in a most  comfortable arm-chair with a silk handkerchief over your eyes--they read  a prayer if you are so inclined--you call for a glass of wine, or a cup  of coffee--an iced cream--a dram--any thing you please, in fact, and  your desires are instantly complied with--you put the cup to the lip,  and just at that moment swap comes the whistling sabre.    _Shepherd_.--Preserve us! keep your hand to yoursell, Captain.    _Odoherty_.--Sweep he comes--the basket is ready, they put a clean  towel over it--pack off the cold meat to the hospital--scrub the  scaffold--take it to pieces--all within five minutes.    _Shepherd_.--That's capital. In fact a' these are civilized  exits--but oh! man, man, to think of a lion on the Burntsfield  Links--what would your gowfers say to that, Mr. Tickler?    _Tickler_.--A rum customer certainly.    _Shepherd_.--Oh! the een, the red, fiery, fixit, unwinkin' een, I  think I see them--and the laigh, deep, dour growl, like the purring o'  ten hundred cats--and the muckle white sharp teeth girnin' and  grundin'--and the lang rough tongue, and the yirnest slaver running  outour the chaps o' the brute--and the cauld shiver---minutes may  be--and than the loup like lightning, and your back-bane broken wi' a  thud, like a rotten rash--and then the creature begins to lick your face  wi' his tongue, and sniffle and snort over owre you, and now a snap at  your nose, and than a rive out o' your breast, and then a crunch at your  knee--and you're a' the time quite sensible, particularly sensible.    _Odoherty_.--Give him a dig in the muzzle, and he'll tip you the  _coup-de-grace_.    _North_.--What a vivid imagination the Shepherd has--well,  cowardice is an inspiring principle.           *       *       *       *       *      HEAD WAGER.      The following is a story from a MS., copied by Gaillard, in his Life of  Francis I.:--    Duprat said in one of the conversations with the emperor's minister,  that he would consent to lose his head if his sovereign had aided Robert  de la Mark against Charles. The Spanish chancellor claimed du Prat's  head as forfeited, for, he said he had in his possession letters which  proved Francis's connivance with Robert de la Mark. \"My head is my own  yet,\" replied Du Prat, \"for I have the originals of the letters you  allude to, and they in no manner justify the scorn you would put upon  them.\" \"If I had won your head,\" replied the imperial chancellor, \"you  might keep it still. I protest I would rather have a pig's head, for  that would be more eatable.\" _Monthly Mag._           *       *       *       *       *          The Novelist.           *       *       *       *       *      FAIR FANARIOTE.      In consequence of the numerous revolutions that have accompanied the  fall of the Greek empire in Byzantium, most of the inhabitants of  Fanari, near Constantinople, boast of being descendants of the dethroned  imperial families; a circumstance which is probable enough, and which  nobody takes the trouble to dispute, any more than the alleged nobility  of the Castilian peasantry, or the absurd genealogies of certain great  families.    In a retired street in Pera, (one of the suburbs of Constantinople,) a  descendant of the Cantacuzenes followed the humble calling of a butcher;  but, in spite of industry and activity, he had great difficulty in  earning a sufficiency to pay his way, and maintain his wife and his only  daughter, Sophia. The latter had just entered her fourteenth year, and  her growing beauty was the admiration of the whole neighbourhood.    Fate, or, if you please so to call it, Providence, ordained that the  poor butcher should suffer repeated losses, which reduced him to a  condition bordering on beggary. His wife unfolded her distressed  circumstances to a Greek, one of her relations, who was Dragoman to the  French embassy, and who, in his turn, related the story to the Marquess  de Vauban, the ambassador. This nobleman became interested for the  unfortunate family, and especially for Sophia, whom the officious  Dragoman described as being likely to fall into the snares that were  laid for her, and to become an inmate of the haram of some Pasha, or  even of a Turk of inferior rank. Prompted by pity, curiosity, or perhaps  by some other motive, the ambassador paid a visit to the distressed  family. He saw Sophia, was charmed by her beauty and intelligence, and  he proposed that her "]]]
