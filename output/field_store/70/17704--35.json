Could it be that that  ugly-looking bug was as dangerous an enemy to the baby Toad as Reddy Fox is  to a baby Rabbit? He began to suspect so, and a little later he knew so,  for there was that same little pollywog trying hard to swim and making bad  work of it, because he had lost half of his long tail.    That set Peter to watching sharper than ever, and presently he discovered  that pollywogs have to keep their eyes open quite as much as do baby  Rabbits, if they would live to grow up. There were several kinds of queer,  ugly-looking bugs forever darting out at the wriggling pollywogs.  Hungry-looking fish lay in wait for them, and Longlegs the Blue Heron  seemed to have a special liking for them. But the pollywogs were spry, and  seemed to have learned to watch out. They seemed to Peter to spend all  their time swimming and eating and growing. They grew so fast that it  seemed to him that he could almost _see_ them grow. And just imagine how  surprised Peter was to discover one day that that very pollywog which he  had seen lose his tail had grown a _new_ one. That puzzled Peter more than  anything he had seen in a long time.    \"Why, I couldn't do that!\" he exclaimed right out loud.    \"Do what?\" demanded Jerry Muskrat, who happened along just then.    \"Why, grow a new tail like that pollywog,\" replied Peter, and told Jerry  all that he had seen. Jerry laughed.    \"You'll see queerer things than that if you watch those pollywogs long  enough,\" said he. \"They are a queer lot of babies, and very interesting to  watch if you've got the time for it. I haven't. This Smiling Pool is a  great kindergarten, and there's something happening here every minute.  There's no place like it.\"    \"Are those great big fat pollywogs Grandfather Frog's children, or Old Mr.  Toad's?\" asked Peter.    \"Grandfather Frog's last year's children,\" replied Jerry. \"They'll grow  into real Frogs this summer, if nothing happens to them.\"    \"Where are Old Mr. Toad's last year's children?\" asked Peter.    \"Don't ask me,\" replied Jerry. \"They hopped away last summer. Never saw  anything like the way those Toad youngsters grow. Those Toad pollywogs you  see now will turn into real Toads, and be leaving the Smiling Pool in a few  weeks. People think Old Mr. Toad is slow, but there is nothing slow about  his children. Look at that little fellow over there; he's begun to grow  legs already.\"    Peter looked, and sure enough there was a pollywog with a pair of legs  sprouting out. They were his fore legs, and they certainly did make him  look funny. And only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs.    \"My gracious!\" exclaimed Peter. \"What a funny sight! I thought my babies  grew fast, but these beat them.\"          X      THE LITTLE TOADS START OUT TO SEE THE WORLD      The world is a wonderful great big place      And in it the young must roam    To learn what their elders have long since learned--      There's never a place like home.    It had been some time since Peter Rabbit had visited the Smiling Pool to  watch the pollywogs. But one cloudy morning he happened to think of them,  and decided that he would run over there and see how they were getting  along. So off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He wondered if those  pollywog children of Old Mr. Toad would be much changed. The last time he  saw them some of them had just begun to grow legs, although they still had  long tails.    He had almost reached the Smiling Pool when great big drops of rain began  to splash down. And with those first raindrops something funny happened.  Anyway, it seemed funny to Peter. Right away he was surrounded by tiny  little Toads. Everywhere he looked he saw Toads, tiny little Toads just  like Old Mr. Toad, only so tiny that one could have sat comfortably on a  ten-cent piece and still had plenty of room.    Peter's big eyes grew round with surprise as he stared. Where had they all  come from so suddenly? A minute before he hadn't seen a single one, and now  he could hardly move without stepping on one. It seemed, it really seemed,  as if each raindrop turned into a tiny Toad the instant it struck the  ground. Of course Peter knew that that couldn't be, but it was very  puzzling. And all those little Toads were bravely hopping along as if they  were bound for some particular place.    Peter watched them for a few minutes, then he once more started for the  Smiling Pool. On the very bank whom should he meet but Old Mr. Toad. He  looked rather thin, and his back was to the Smiling Pool. Yes, Sir, he was  hopping away from the Smiling Pool where he had been all the spring,  singing in the great chorus. Peter was almost as surprised to see him as he  had been to see the little Toads, but just then he was most interested in  those little Toads.    \"Good morning, Old Mr. Toad,\" said Peter in his most polite manner. \"Can  you tell me where all these little Toads came from?\"    [Illustration: \"Can you tell me where all these little Toads came from?\"]    \"Certainly,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"They came from the Smiling Pool, of  course. Where did you suppose they came from?\"    \"I--I didn't know. There wasn't one to be seen, and then it began to rain,  and right away they were everywhere. It--it almost seemed as if they had  rained down out of the sky.\"    Old Mr. Toad chuckled. \"They've got good sense, if I must say it about my  own children,\" said he. \"They know that wet weather is the only weather for  Toads to travel in. They left the Smiling Pool in the night while it was  damp and comfortable, and then, when the sun came up, they hid, like  sensible children, under anything they could find, sticks, stones, pieces  of bark, grass. The minute this shower came up, they knew it was good  traveling weather and out they popped.\"    \"But what did they leave the Smiling Pool for?\" Peter asked.    \"To see the Great World,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"Foolish, very foolish of  them, but they would do it. I did the same thing myself when I was their  age. Couldn't stop me any more than I could stop them. They don't know when  they're well off, but young folks never do. Fine weather, isn't it?\"          XI      OLD MR. TOAD'S QUEER TONGUE      Old Mother Nature doth provide      For all her children, large or small.    Her wisdom foresees all their needs      And makes provision for them all.    If you don't believe it, just you go ask Old Mr. Toad, as Peter Rabbit did,  how such a slow-moving fellow as he is can catch enough bugs and insects to  keep him alive. Perhaps you'll learn something just as Peter did. Peter and  Old Mr. Toad sat in the rain watching the tiny Toads, who, you know, were  Mr. Toad's children, leaving their kindergarten in the Smiling Pool and  starting out to see the Great World. When the last little Toad had passed  them, Old Mr. Toad suddenly remembered that he was hungry, very hungry  indeed.    \"Didn't have time to eat much while I was in the Smiling Pool,\" he  explained. \"Couldn't eat and sing too, and while I was down there, I was  supposed to sing. Now that it is time to quit singing, I begin to realize  that I've got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice. See that bug  over there on that leaf? Watch him.\"    Peter looked, and sure enough there was a fat bug crawling along on an old  leaf. He was about two inches from Old Mr. Toad, and he was crawling very  fast. And right while Peter was looking at him he disappeared. Peter turned  to look at Old Mr. Toad. He hadn't budged. He was sitting exactly where he  had been sitting all the time, but he was smacking his lips, and there was  a twinkle of satisfaction in his eyes. Peter opened his eyes very wide.    \"Wha--what--\" he began.    \"Nice bug,\" interrupted Old Mr. Toad. \"Nicest bug I've eaten for a  longtime.\"    \"But I didn't see you catch him!\" protested Peter, looking at Old Mr. Toad  as if he suspected him of joking.    \"Anything wrong with your eyes?\" inquired Old Mr. Toad.    \"No,\" replied Peter just a wee bit crossly. \"My eyes are just as good as  ever.\"    \"Then watch me catch that fly over yonder,\" said Old Mr. Toad. He hopped  towards a fly which had lighted on a blade of grass just ahead. About two  inches from it he stopped, and so far as Peter could see, he sat perfectly  still. But the fly disappeared, and it wasn't because it flew away, either.  Peter was sure of that. As he told Mrs. Peter about it afterwards, \"It was  there, and then it wasn't, and that was all there was to it.\"    Old Mr. Toad chuckled. \"Didn't you see that one go, Peter?\" he asked.    Peter shook his head. \"I wish you Would stop fooling me,\" said Peter. \"The  joke is on me, but now you've had your laugh at my expense, I wish you  would tell me how you do it. Please, Mr. Toad.\"    Now when Peter said please that way, of course Old Mr. Toad couldn't resist  him. Nobody could.    \"Here comes an ant this way. Now you watch my mouth instead of the ant and  see what happens,\" said Old Mr. Toad.    Peter looked and saw a big black ant coming. Then he kept his eyes on Old  Mr. Toad's mouth. Suddenly there was a little flash of red from it, so tiny  and so quick that Peter couldn't be absolutely sure that he saw it. But  when he looked for the ant, it was nowhere to be seen. Peter looked at Old  Mr. Toad very hard.    \"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Toad, that you've got a tongue long enough to  reach way over to where that ant was?\" he asked.    Old Mr. Toad chuckled again. With every insect swallowed he felt better  natured. \"You've guessed it, Peter,\" said he. \"Handy tongue, isn't it?\"    \"I think it's a very queer tongue,\" retorted Peter, \"and I don't understand  it at all. If it's so long as all that, where do you keep it when it isn't  in use? I should think you'd have to swallow it to get it out of the way,  or else leave it hanging out of your mouth.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Old Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#4)"],[1,",  without violating ancient verities.    In studying these crucial periods in the history of European  architecture it is possible to trace a gradual growth or unfolding  as of a plant. It is a fact fairly well established that the Greeks  derived their architecture and ornament from Egypt; the Romans in  turn borrowed from the Greeks; while a Gothic cathedral is a lineal  descendant from a Roman basilica.    [Illustration 2]    [Illustration 3]    The Egyptians in their constructions did little more than to place  enormous stones on end, and pile one huge block upon another. They  used many columns placed close together: the spaces which they spanned  were inconsiderable. The upright or supporting member may be said to  have been in Egyptian architecture the predominant one. A vertical  line therefore may be taken as the simplest and most abstract symbol  of Egyptian architecture (Illustration 2). It remained for the Greeks  fully to develop the lintel. In their architecture the vertical  member, or column, existed solely for the sake of the horizontal  member, or lintel; it rarely stood alone as in the case of an Egyptian  obelisk. The columns of the Greek temples were reduced to those  proportions most consistent with strength and beauty, and the  intercolumnations were relatively greater than in Egyptian examples.  It may truly be said that Greek architecture exhibits the perfect  equality and equipoise of vertical and horizontal elements and these  only, no other factor entering in. Its graphic symbol would therefore  be composed of a vertical and a horizontal line (Illustration 3). The  Romans, while retaining the column and lintel of the Greeks, deprived  them of their structural significance and subordinated them to the  semicircular arch and the semi-cylindrical and hemispherical vault,  the truly characteristic and determining forms of Roman architecture.  Our symbol grows therefore by the addition of the arc of a circle  (Illustration 4). In Gothic architecture column, lintel, arch and  vault are all retained in changed form, but that which more than  anything else differentiates Gothic architecture from any style which  preceded it is the introduction of the principle of an equilibrium of  forces, of a state of balance rather than a state of rest, arrived at  by the opposition of one thrust with another contrary to it. This fact  can be indicated graphically by two opposing inclined lines, and  these united to the preceding symbol yield an accurate abstract of the  elements of Gothic architecture (Illustration 5).    [Illustration 4]    [Illustration 5]    All this is but an unusual application of a familiar theosophic  teaching, namely, that it is the method of nature on every plane and  in every department not to omit anything that has gone before, but to  store it up and carry it along and bring it into manifestation later.  Nature everywhere proceeds like the jingle of _The House that Jack  Built_: she repeats each time all she has learned, and adds another  line for subsequent repetition.    [Footnote A: The quaint Oriental imagery here employed should not  blind the reader to the precise scientific accuracy of the idea of  which this imagery is the vehicle. Schopenhauer says: \"Polarity, or  the sundering of a force into two quantitively different and opposed  activities striving after re-union,... is a fundamental type of almost  all the phenomena of nature, from the magnet and the crystal to man  himself.\"]          II    UNITY AND POLARITY      Theosophy, both as a philosophy, or system of thought, which discovers  correlations between things apparently unrelated, and as a life,  or system of training whereby it is possible to gain the power to  perceive and use these correlations for worthy ends, is of great value  to the creative artist, whose success depends on the extent to which  he works organically, conforming to the cosmic pattern, proceeding  rationally and rhythmically to some predetermined end. It is of value  no less to the layman, the critic, the art amateur--to anyone in  fact who would come to an accurate and intimate understanding and  appreciation of every variety of esthetic endeavor. For the benefit of  such I shall try to trace some of those correlations which theosophy  affirms, and indicate their bearing upon art, and upon the art of  architecture in particular.    One of the things which theosophy teaches is that those transcendent  glimpses of a divine order and harmony throughout the universe  vouchsafed the poet and the mystic in their moments of vision are not  the paradoxes--the paronomasia as it were--of an intoxicated state of  consciousness, but glimpses of reality. We are all of us participators  in a world of concrete music, geometry and number--a world of  sounds, odors, forms, motions, colors, so mathematically related and  coordinated that our pigmy bodies, equally with the farthest star,  vibrate to the music of the spheres. There is a _Beautiful Necessity_  which rules the world, which is a law of nature and equally a law of  art, for art is idealized creation: nature carried to a higher power  by reason of its passage through a human consciousness. Thought and  emotion tend to crystallize into forms of beauty as inevitably as does  the frost on a window pane. Art therefore in one of its aspects is the  weaving of a pattern, the communication of an order and a method to  the material or medium employed. Although no masterpiece was ever  created by the conscious following to set rules, for the true artist  works unconsciously, instinctively, as the bird sings or as the bee  builds its honey-cell, yet an analysis of any masterpiece reveals the  fact that its author (like the bird and the bee) has \"followed the  rules without knowing them.\"    Helmholtz says, \"No doubt is now entertained that beauty is subject  to laws and rules dependent on the nature of human intelligence. The  difficulty consists in the fact that these laws and rules, on whose  fulfilment beauty depends, are not consciously present in the mind of  the artist who creates the work, or of the observer who contemplates  it.\" Nevertheless they are discoverable, and can be formulated,  after a fashion. We have only to read aright the lessons everywhere  portrayed in the vast picture-books of nature and of art.    The first truth therein published is the law of _Unity_--oneness; for  there is one Self, one Life, which, myriad in manifestation, is yet  in essence ever _one_. Atom and universe, man and the world--each is  a unit, an organic and coherent whole. The application of this law to  art is so obvious as to be almost unnecessary of elucidation, for to  say that a work of art must possess unity, must seem to proceed from a  single impulse and be the embodiment of one dominant idea, is to state  a truism. In a work of architecture the cooerdination of its various  parts with one another is almost the measure of its success. We  remember any masterpiece--the cathedral of Paris no less than the  pyramids of Egypt--by the singleness of its appeal; complex it may be,  but it is a coordinated complexity; variety it may possess, but it is  a variety in an all-embracing unity.    The second law, not contradicting but supplementing the first is the  law of _Polarity_, i.e., duality. All things have sex, are either  masculine or feminine. This too is the reflection on a lower plane  of one of those transcendental truths taught by the Ancient Wisdom,  namely that the Logos, in his voluntarily circumscribing his infinite  life in order that he may manifest, encloses himself within his  limiting veil, _maya_, and that his life appears as spirit (male), and  his _maya_ as matter (female), the two being never disjoined during  manifestation. The two terms of this polarity are endlessly repeated  throughout nature: in sun and moon, day and night, fire and water, man  and woman--and so on. A close inter-relation is always seen to subsist  between corresponding members of such pairs of opposites: sun, day,  fire, man express and embody the primal and active aspect of the  manifesting deity; moon, night, water, woman, its secondary and  passive aspect. Moreover, each implies or brings to mind the others  of its class: man, like the sun, is lord of day; he is like fire, a  devastating force; woman is subject to the lunar rhythm; like water,  she is soft, sinuous, fecund.    The part which this polarity plays in the arts is important, and the  constant and characteristic distinction between the two terms is a  thing far beyond mere contrast.    In music they are the major and minor modes: the typical, or  representative chords of the dominant seventh, and of the tonic (the  two chords into which Schopenhauer says all music can be resolved): a  partial dissonance, and a consonance: a chord of suspense, and a chord  of satisfaction. In speech the two are vowel, and consonant sounds:  the type of the first being _a_, a sound of suspense, made with the  mouth open; and of the second _m_, a sound of satisfaction, made by  closing the mouth; their combination forms the sacred syllable Om  (_Aum_). In painting they are warm colors, and cold: the pole of  the first being in red, the color of fire, which excites; and of the  second in blue, the color of water, which calms; in the Arts of design  they are lines straight (like fire), and flowing (like water); masses  light (like the day), and dark (like night). In architecture they are  the column, or vertical member, which resists the force of gravity;  and the lintel, or horizontal member, which succumbs to it; they are  vertical lines, which are aspiring, effortful; and horizontal lines,  which are restful to the eye and mind.    It is desirable to have an instant and keen realization of this sex  quality, and to make this easier some sort of classification and  analysis must be attempted. Those things which are allied to and  partake of the nature of _time_ are"]]]
