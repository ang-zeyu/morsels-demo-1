It is far from translation into familiar acts and objects. Such  material is relatively technical and superficial. Taking the ordinary  standard of reality as a measure, it is artificial. For this measure is  connection with practical concerns. Such material exists in a world by  itself, unassimilated to ordinary customs of thought and expression.  There is the standing danger that the material of formal instruction  will be merely the subject matter of the schools, isolated from the  subject matter of life-experience. The permanent social interests are  likely to be lost from view. Those which have not been carried over  into the structure of social life, but which remain largely matters  of technical information expressed in symbols, are made conspicuous  in schools. Thus we reach the ordinary notion of education: the notion  which ignores its social necessity and its identity with all human  association that affects conscious life, and which identifies it with  imparting information about remote matters and the conveying of learning  through verbal signs: the acquisition of literacy.    Hence one of the weightiest problems with which the philosophy of  education has to cope is the method of keeping a proper balance between  the informal and the formal, the incidental and the intentional,  modes of education. When the acquiring of information and of technical  intellectual skill do not influence the formation of a social  disposition, ordinary vital experience fails to gain in meaning, while  schooling, in so far, creates only \"sharps\" in learning--that is,  egoistic specialists. To avoid a split between what men consciously  know because they are aware of having learned it by a specific job of  learning, and what they unconsciously know because they have absorbed it  in the formation of their characters by intercourse with others,  becomes an increasingly delicate task with every development of special  schooling.    Summary. It is the very nature of life to strive to continue in being.  Since this continuance can be secured only by constant renewals, life  is a self-renewing process. What nutrition and reproduction are to  physiological life, education is to social life. This education consists  primarily in transmission through communication. Communication is a  process of sharing experience till it becomes a common possession. It  modifies the disposition of both the parties who partake in it. That  the ulterior significance of every mode of human association lies in  the contribution which it makes to the improvement of the quality  of experience is a fact most easily recognized in dealing with the  immature. That is to say, while every social arrangement is educative  in effect, the educative effect first becomes an important part of the  purpose of the association in connection with the association of the  older with the younger. As societies become more complex in structure  and resources, the need of formal or intentional teaching and learning  increases. As formal teaching and training grow in extent, there is the  danger of creating an undesirable split between the experience gained in  more direct associations and what is acquired in school. This danger was  never greater than at the present time, on account of the rapid growth  in the last few centuries of knowledge and technical modes of skill.    Chapter Two: Education as a Social Function    1. The Nature and Meaning of Environment. We have seen that a community  or social group sustains itself through continuous self-renewal, and  that this renewal takes place by means of the educational growth of the  immature members of the group. By various agencies, unintentional and  designed, a society transforms uninitiated and seemingly alien beings  into robust trustees of its own resources and ideals. Education is thus  a fostering, a nurturing, a cultivating, process. All of these words  mean that it implies attention to the conditions of growth. We also  speak of rearing, raising, bringing up--words which express the  difference of level which education aims to cover. Etymologically, the  word education means just a process of leading or bringing up. When  we have the outcome of the process in mind, we speak of education as  shaping, forming, molding activity--that is, a shaping into the standard  form of social activity. In this chapter we are concerned with the  general features of the way in which a social group brings up its  immature members into its own social form.    Since what is required is a transformation of the quality of experience  till it partakes in the interests, purposes, and ideas current in the  social group, the problem is evidently not one of mere physical forming.  Things can be physically transported in space; they may be bodily  conveyed. Beliefs and aspirations cannot be physically extracted and  inserted. How then are they communicated? Given the impossibility of  direct contagion or literal inculcation, our problem is to discover the  method by which the young assimilate the point of view of the old, or  the older bring the young into like-mindedness with themselves. The  answer, in general formulation, is: By means of the action of the  environment in calling out certain responses. The required beliefs  cannot be hammered in; the needed attitudes cannot be plastered on. But  the particular medium in which an individual exists leads him to see and  feel one thing rather than another; it leads him to have certain plans  in order that he may act successfully with others; it strengthens some  beliefs and weakens others as a condition of winning the approval of  others. Thus it gradually produces in him a certain system of behavior,  a certain disposition of action. The words \"environment,\" \"medium\"  denote something more than surroundings which encompass an individual.  They denote the specific continuity of the surroundings with his own  active tendencies. An inanimate being is, of course, continuous with  its surroundings; but the environing circumstances do not, save  metaphorically, constitute an environment. For the inorganic being is  not concerned in the influences which affect it. On the other hand,  some things which are remote in space and time from a living creature,  especially a human creature, may form his environment even more truly  than some of the things close to him. The things with which a man varies  are his genuine environment. Thus the activities of the astronomer vary  with the stars at which he gazes or about which he calculates. Of  his immediate surroundings, his telescope is most intimately his  environment. The environment of an antiquarian, as an antiquarian,  consists of the remote epoch of human life with which he is concerned,  and the relics, inscriptions, etc., by which he establishes connections  with that period.    In brief, the environment consists of those conditions that promote or  hinder, stimulate or inhibit, the characteristic activities of a living  being. Water is the environment of a fish because it is necessary to the  fish's activities--to its life. The north pole is a significant element  in the environment of an arctic explorer, whether he succeeds in  reaching it or not, because it defines his activities, makes them what  they distinctively are. Just because life signifies not bare passive  existence (supposing there is such a thing), but a way of acting,  environment or medium signifies what enters into this activity as a  sustaining or frustrating condition.    2. The Social Environment. A being whose activities are associated with  others has a social environment. What he does and what he can do depend  upon the expectations, demands, approvals, and condemnations of others.  A being connected with other beings cannot perform his own activities  without taking the activities of others into account. For they are the  indispensable conditions of the realization of his tendencies. When he  moves he stirs them and reciprocally. We might as well try to imagine a  business man doing business, buying and selling, all by himself, as to  conceive it possible to define the activities of an individual in terms  of his isolated actions. The manufacturer moreover is as truly socially  guided in his activities when he is laying plans in the privacy of his  own counting house as when he is buying his raw material or selling  his finished goods. Thinking and feeling that have to do with action in  association with others is as much a social mode of behavior as is the  most overt cooperative or hostile act.    What we have more especially to indicate is how the social medium  nurtures its immature members. There is no great difficulty in seeing  how it shapes the external habits of action. Even dogs and horses have  their actions modified by association with human beings; they form  different habits because human beings are concerned with what they do.  Human beings control animals by controlling the natural stimuli which  influence them; by creating a certain environment in other words. Food,  bits and bridles, noises, vehicles, are used to direct the ways in  which the natural or instinctive responses of horses occur. By operating  steadily to call out certain acts, habits are formed which function with  the same uniformity as the original stimuli. If a rat is put in a  maze and finds food only by making a given number of turns in a given  sequence, his activity is gradually modified till he habitually takes  that course rather than another when he is hungry.    Human actions are modified in a like fashion. A burnt child dreads the  fire; if a parent arranged conditions so that every time a child touched  a certain toy he got burned, the child would learn to avoid that toy  as automatically as he avoids touching fire. So far, however, we are  dealing with what may be called training in distinction from educative  teaching.

We'd have 'em real often in  the winter if it wasn't such a job to git music. Well, I got too much to do  to be standin' here talkin'. I have to keep right after that breed girl all  the time, or she won't do nothing. I'll git my old man after your fellow  right away. Jest make yourself to home, and anything you want ask for it  in the kitchen.\" She smiled in friendly fashion and closed the door with a  little slam to make sure that it latched.    Valeria stood for a moment with her hands hanging straight at her  sides, staring absently at the door. Then she glanced at Walt, staring  wooden-faced from his gilt frame upon his gilt easel, and shivered. She  pushed the red plush chair as far away from him as possible, sat down with  her back to the picture, and immediately felt his dull, black eyes boring  into her back.    \"What a fool I must be!\" she said aloud, glancing reluctantly over her  shoulder at the portrait. She got up resolutely, placed the chair where it  had stood before, and stared deliberately at Walt, as if she would prove  how little she cared. But in a moment more she was crying dismally.          CHAPTER II. WELL-MEANT ADVICE    Kent Burnett, bearing over his arm a coat newly pressed in the Delmonico  restaurant, dodged in at the back door of the saloon, threw the coat down  upon the tousled bed, and pushed back his hat with a gesture of relief at  an onerous duty well performed.    \"I had one hell of a time,\" he announced plaintively, \"and that Chink will  likely try to poison me if I eat over there, after this--but I got her  ironed, all right. Get into it, Man, and chase yourself over there to the  hotel. Got a clean collar? That one's all-over coffee.\"    Fleetwood stifled a groan, reached into a trousers pocket, and brought up a  dollar. \"Get me one at the store, will you, Kent? Fifteen and a half--and a  tie, if they've got any that's decent. And hurry! Such a triple-three-star  fool as I am ought to be taken out and shot.\"    He went on cursing himself audibly and bitterly, even after Kent  had hurried out. He was sober now--was Manley Fleetwood--sober and  self-condemnatory and penitent. His head ached splittingly; his eyes  were heavy-lidded and bloodshot, and his hands trembled so that he could  scarcely button his coat. But he was sober. He did not even carry the odor  of whisky upon his breath or his person; for Kent had been very thoughtful  and very thorough. He had compelled his patient to crunch and swallow many  nauseous tablets of \"whisky killer,\" and he had sprinkled his clothes  liberally with Jockey Club; Fleetwood, therefore, while he emanated odors  in plenty, carried about him none of the aroma properly belonging to  intoxication.    In ten minutes Kent was back, with a celluloid collar and two ties of  questionable taste. Manley just glanced at them, waved them away with  gloomy finality, and swore.    \"They're just about the limit, and that's no dream,\" sympathized Kent, \"but  they're clean, and they don't look like they'd been slept in for a month.  You've got to put 'em on--by George, I sized up the layout in both those  imitation stores, and I drew the highest in the deck. And for the Lord's  sake, get a move on. Here, I'll button it for you.\"    Behind Fleetwood's back, when collar and tie were in place, Kent grinned  and lowered an eyelid at Jim, who put his head in from the saloon to see  how far the sobering had progressed.    \"You look fine!\" he encouraged heartily. \"That green-and-blue tie's just  what you need to set you off. And the collar sure is shiny and nice--your  girl will be plumb dazzled. She won't see anything wrong--believe _me_.  Now, run along and get married. Here, you better sneak out the back way; if  she happened to be looking out, she'd likely wonder what you were doing,  coming out of a saloon. Duck out past the coal shed and cut into the street  by Brinberg's. Tell her you're sick--got a sick headache. Your looks'll  swear it's the truth. Hike!\" He opened the door and pushed Fleetwood out,  watched him out of sight around the corner of Brinberg's store, and turned  back into the close-smelling little room.    \"Do you know,\" he remarked to Jim, \"I never thought of it before, but I've  been playing a low-down trick on that poor girl. I kinda wish now I'd put  her next, and given her a chance to draw outa the game if she wanted to.  It's stacking the deck on her, if you ask _me_!\" He pushed his hat back  upon his head, gave his shoulders a twist of dissatisfaction, and told Jim  to dig up some Eastern beer; drank it meditatively, and set down the glass  with some force.    \"Yes, sir,\" he said disgustedly, \"darn my fool soul, I stacked the deck on  that girl--and she looked to be real nice. Kinda innocent and trusting,  like she hasn't found out yet how rotten mean men critters can be.\" He took  the bottle and poured himself another glass. \"She's sure due to wise up a  lot,\" he added grimly.    \"You bet your sweet life!\" Jim agreed, and then he reconsidered. \"Still, I  dunno; Man ain't so worse. He ain't what you can call a real booze fighter.  This here's what I'd call an accidental jag; got it in the exuberance of  the joyful moment when he knew his girl was coming. He'll likely straighten  up and be all right. He--\" Jim broke off there and looked to see who had  opened the door.    \"Hello, Polly,\" he greeted carelessly.    The man came forward, grinning skinnily. Polycarp Jenks was the outrageous  name of him. He was under the average height, and he was lean to the point  of emaciation. His mouth was absolutely curveless--a straight gash across  his face; a gash which simply stopped short without any tapering or any  turn at the corners, when it had reached as far as was decent. His nose was  also straight and high, and owned no perceptible slope; indeed, it seemed  merely a pendant attached to his forehead, and its upper termination was  indefinite, except that somewhere between his eyebrows one felt impelled to  consider it forehead rather than nose. His eyes also were rather long and  narrow, like buttonholes cut to match the mouth. When he grinned his face  appeared to break up into splinters.    He was intensely proud of his name, and his pleasure was almost pathetic  when one pronounced it without curtailment in his presence. His skinniness  was also a matter of pride. And when you realize that he was an  indefatigable gossip, and seemed always to be riding at large, gathering or  imparting trivial news, you should know fairly well Polycarp Jenks.    \"I see Man Fleetwood's might' near sober enough to git married,\" Polycarp  began, coming up to the two and leaning a sharp elbow upon the bar beside  Kent. \"By granny, gitting married'd sober anybody! Dinner time he was so  drunk he couldn't find his mouth. I met him up here a little ways just now,  and he was so sober he remembered to pay me that ten I lent him t' other  day--_he-he!_ Open up a bottle of pop, James.    \"His girl's been might' near crying her eyes out, 'cause he didn't show  up. Mis' Hawley says she looked like she was due at a funeral 'stid of a  weddin'. 'Clined to be stuck up, accordin' to Mis' Hawley--shied at hearin'  about Walt--_he-he!_ I'll bet there ain't been a transient to that hotel in  the last five year, man or woman, that ain't had to hear about Walt and the  shotgun--Pop's all right on a hot day, you bet!    \"She's got two trunks and a fiddle over to the depot--don't see how 'n the  world Man's going to git 'em out to the ranch; they're might' near as big  as claim shacks, both of 'em. Time she gits 'em into Man's shack she'll  have to go outside every time she wants to turn around--_he-he!_ By  granny--two trunks, to one woman! Have some pop, Kenneth, on me.    \"The boys are talkin' about a shivaree t'-night. On the quiet, y' know.  Some of 'em's workin' on a horse fiddle now, over in the lumber yard.  Wanted me to play a coal-oil can, but I dunno. I'm gittin' a leetle old for  sech doings. Keeps you up nights too much. Man had any sense, he'd marry  and pull outa town. 'Bout fifteen or twenty in the bunch, and a string of  cans and irons to reach clean across the street. By granny, I'm going to  plug m' ears good with cotton when it comes off--_he-he!_ 'Nother bottle of  pop, James.\"    \"Who's running the show, Polycarp?\" Kent asked, accepting the glass of soda  because he disliked to offend. \"Funny I didn't hear about it.\"    Polycarp twisted his slit of a mouth knowingly, and closed one slit of an  eye to assist the facial elucidation.    \"Ain't funny--not when I tell you Fred De Garmo's handing out the  _in_vites, and he sure aims to have plenty of excitement--_he-he!_  Betcher Manley won't be able to set on the wagon seat an' hold the lines  t'-morrow--not if he comes out when he's called and does the thing  proper--_he-he!_ An' if he don't show up, they aim to jest about pull the  old shebang down over his ears. Hope'll think it's the day of judgment,  sure--_he-he!_ Reckon I might's well git in on the fun--they won't be no  sleepin' within ten mile of the place, nohow, and a feller always sees the  joke better when he's lendin' a hand. Too bad you an' Fred's on the outs,  Kenneth.\"    \"Oh, I don't know--it suits me fine,\" Kent declared easily, setting down  his glass with a sigh of relief; he hated \"pop.\"    \"What's it all about, anyway?\" quizzed Polycarp, hungering for the details  which had thus far been denied him. \"De Garmo sees red whenever anybody  mentions your name, Kenneth--but I never did hear no particulars.\"    \"No?\" Kent was turning toward the door. \"Well, you see, Fred claims he  can holler louder than I can, and I say he can't.\" He opened the door and  calmly departed, leaving Polycarp looking exceedingly foolish and a bit  angry.    Straight to the hotel, without any pretense at disguising his destination, "]]]
