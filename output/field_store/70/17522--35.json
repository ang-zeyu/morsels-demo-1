The meeting-house not only was employed for the worship of God and for town  meetings, but it was a storehouse as well. Until after the Revolutionary  War it was universally used as a powder magazine; and indeed, as no fire in  stove or fireplace was ever allowed within, it was a safe enough place for  the explosive material. In Hanover, the powder room was in the steeple,  while in Quincy the \"powder-closite\" was in the beams of the roof. Whenever  there chanced to be a thunderstorm during the time of public worship, the  people of Beverly ran out under the trees, and in other towns they left  the meeting-house if the storm seemed severe or near; still they built no  powder houses. Grain, too, was stored in the loft of the meeting-house for  safety; hatches were built, and often the corn paid to the minister was  placed there. \"Leantos,\" or \"linters,\" were sometimes built by the side of  the building for use for storage. In Springfield, Mr. Pyncheon was allowed  to place his corn in the roof chamber of the meeting-house; but as the  people were afraid that the great weight might burst the floor, he was  forbidden to store more than four hundred bushels at a time, unless he  \"underpropped the floor.\"    In one church in the Connecticut valley, in a township where it was  forbidden that tobacco be smoked upon the public streets, the church  loft was used to dry and store the freshly cut tobacco-leaves which the  inhabitants sold to the \"ungodly Dutch.\" Thus did greed for gain lead even  blue Connecticut Christians to profane the house of God.    The early meeting-houses in country parishes were seldom painted, such  outward show being thought vain and extravagant. In the middle of the  eighteenth century paint became cheaper and more plentiful, and a gay  rivalry in church-decoration sprang up. One meeting-house had to be as fine  as its neighbor. Votes were taken, \"rates were levied,\" gifts were asked  in every town to buy \"colour\" for the meeting-house. For instance, the new  meeting-house in Pomfret, Connecticut, was painted bright yellow; it proved  a veritable golden apple of discord throughout the county. Windham town  quickly voted that its meeting-house be \"coloured something like the  Pomfret meeting-house.\" Killingly soon ordered that the \"cullering of the  body of our meeting-house should be like the Pomfret meeting-house, and the  Roff shal be cullered Read.\" Brooklyn church then, in 1762, ordered that  the outside of its meeting-house be \"culered\" in the approved fashion.  The body of the house was painted a bright orange; the doors and \"bottom  boards\" a warm chocolate color; the \"window-jets,\" corner-boards, and  weather-boards white. What a bright nosegay of color! As a crowning glory  Brooklyn people put up an \"Eleclarick Rod\" on the gorgeous edifice, and  proudly boasted that--Brooklyn meeting-house was the \"newest biggest and  yallowest\" in the county. One old writer, however, spoke scornfully of the  spirit of envious emulation, extravagance, and bad taste that spread and  prevailed from the example of the foolish and useless \"colouring\" of the  Pomfret meeting-house.    Within the meeting-house all was simple enough: raftered walls, sanded  floors, rows of benches, a few pews, and the pulpit, or the \"scaffold,\"  as John Cotton called it. The bare rafters were often profusely hung with  dusty spiders' webs, and were the home also of countless swallows, that  flew in and out of the open bell-turret. Sometimes, too, mischievous  squirrels, attracted by the corn in the meeting-house loft, made their  homes in the sanctuary; and they were so prolific and so omnivorous that  the Bible and the pulpit cushions were not safe from their nibbling  attacks. On every Sunday afternoon the Word of God and its sustaining  cushion had to be removed to the safe shelter of a neighboring farmhouse or  tavern, to prevent total annihilation by these Puritanical, Bible-loving  squirrels.    The pulpits were often pretentious, even in the plain and undecorated  meeting-houses, and were usually high desks, to which a narrow flight of  stairs led. In the churches of the third stage of architecture, these  stairs were often inclosed in a towering hexagonal mahogany structure,  which was ornamented with pillars and panels. Into this the minister  walked, closed the door behind him, and invisibly ascended the stairs;  while the children counted the seconds from the time he closed the door  until his head appeared through the trap-door at the top of the pulpit. The  form known as a tub-pulpit was very popular in the larger churches. The  pulpit of one old, unpainted church retained until the middle of this  century, as its sole decoration, an enormous, carefully painted, staring  eye, a terrible and suggestive illustration to youthful wrong-doers of the  great, all-seeing eye of God.    As the ceiling and rafters were so open and reverberating, it was generally  thought imperative to hang above the pulpit a great sounding-board, which  threatened the minister like a giant extinguisher, and was really as devoid  of utility as it was curious in ornamentation, \"reflecting most part an  empty ineffectual sound.\" This great sound-killer was decorated with carved  and painted rosettes, as in the Shrewsbury meeting-house; with carved ivy  leaves, as in Farmington; with a carved bunch of grapes or pomegranates, as  in the Leicester church; with letters indicating a date, as, \"M. R. H.\" for  March, in the Hadley church; with appropriate mottoes and texts, such as  the words, \"Holiness is the Lords,\" in the Windham church; with cords and  tassels, with hanging fringes, with panels and balls; and thus formed a  great ornament to the church, and a source of honest pride to the church  members. The clumsy sounding-board was usually hung by a slight iron rod,  which looked smaller still as it stretched up to the high, raftered roof,  and always appeared to be entirely insufficient to sustain the great weight  of the heavy machine. In Danvers, one of these useless though ornamental  structures hung within eighteen inches of the preacher's nose, on a slender  bar thirty feet in length; and every Sunday the children gazed with  fascinated anticipation at the slight rod and the great hexagonal  extinguisher, thinking and hoping that on this day the sounding-board would  surely drop, and \"put out\" the minister. In fact, it was regarded by many  a child, though this idea was hardly formulated in the little brain, as  a visible means of possible punishment for any false doctrine that might  issue from the mouth of the preacher.    Another pastime and source of interest to the children in many old churches  was the study of the knots and veins in the unpainted wood of which the  pews and galleries were made. Age had developed and darkened and rendered  visible all the natural irregularities in the wood, just as it had brought  out and strengthened the dry-woody, close, unaired, penetrating scent which  permeated the meeting-house and gave it the distinctive \"church smell.\" The  children, and perhaps a few of the grown people, found in these clusters  of knots queer similitudes of faces, strange figures and constellations,  which, though conned Sunday after Sunday until known by heart, still seemed  ever to show in their irregular groupings a puzzling possibility of the  discovery of new configurations and monstrosities.    The dangling, dusty spiders' webs afforded, too, an interesting sight and  diversion for the sermon-hearing, but not sermon-listening, young Puritans,  who watched the cobwebs swaying, trembling, forming strange maps of  imaginary rivers with their many tributaries, or outlines of intersecting  roads and lanes. And if little Yet-Once, Hate-Evil, or Shearjashub chanced,  by good fortune, to be seated near a window where a crafty spider and a  foolish buzzing fly could be watched through the dreary exposition and  attempted reconciliation of predestination and free will, that indeed were  a happy way of passing the weary hours.          II.    The Church Militant.        For many years after the settlement of New England the Puritans, even in  outwardly tranquil times, went armed to meeting; and to sanctify the Sunday  gun-loading they were expressly forbidden to fire off their charges at  any object on that day save an Indian or a wolf, their two \"greatest  inconveniencies.\" Trumbull, in his \"Mac Fingal,\" Avrites thus in jest of  this custom of Sunday arm-bearing:--      \"So once, for fear of Indian beating,    Our grandsires bore their guns to meeting,--    Each man equipped on Sunday morn    With psalm-book, shot, and powder-horn,    And looked in form, as all must grant,    Like the ancient true church militant.\"    In 1640 it was ordered in Massachusetts that in every township the  attendants at church should carry a \"competent number of peeces, fixed  and compleat with powder and shot and swords every Lords-day to the  meeting-house;\" one armed man from each household was then thought  advisable and necessary for public safety. In 1642 six men with muskets and  powder and shot were thought sufficient for protection for each church. In  Connecticut similar mandates were issued, and as the orders were neglected  \"by divers persones,\" a law was passed in 1643 that each offender should  forfeit twelve pence for each offence. In 1644 a fourth part of the  \"trayned hand\" was obliged to come armed each Sabbath, and the sentinels  were ordered to keep their matches constantly lighted for use in their  match-locks. They were also commanded to wear armor, which consisted of  \"coats basted with cotton-wool, and thus made defensive against Indian  arrows.\" In 1650 so much dread and fear were felt of Sunday attacks from  the red men that the Sabbath-Day guard was doubled in number. In 1692, the  Connecticut Legislature ordered one fifth of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8675"],[0,"Welsh Fairy-Tales and Other Stories (#3)"],[1,"in  those days, after the young lambs.    Now the prince had several hunting-houses--sorts of farm houses, one of  them was at the place now called Beth-Gelert, for the wolves were very  thick there at this time. Now the prince used to travel from farm-house  to farm-house with his family and friends, when going on these hunting  parties.    One season they went hunting from Aber, and stopped at the house where  Beth-Gelert is now--it's about fourteen miles away. The prince had all  his hounds with him, but his favourite was Gelert, a hound who had never  let off a wolf for six years.    The prince loved the dog like a child, and at the sound of his horn  Gelert was always the first to come bounding up. There was company  at the house, and one day they went hunting, leaving his wife and the  child, in a big wooden cradle, behind him at the farm-house.    The hunting party killed three or four wolves, and about two hours  before the word passed for returning home, Llewellyn missed Gelert, and  he asked his huntsmen:    \"Where's Gelert? I don't see him.\"    \"Well, indeed, master, I've missed him this half-hour.\"    And Llewellyn blew his horn, but no Gelert came at the sound.    Indeed, Gelert had got on to a wolves' track which led to the house.    The prince sounded the return, and they went home, the prince lamenting  Gelert. \"He's sure to have been slain--he's sure to have been slain!  since he did not answer the horn. Oh, my Gelert!\" And they approached  the house, and the prince went into the house, and saw Gelert lying by  the overturned cradle, and blood all about the room.    \"What! hast thou slain my child?\" said the prince, and ran his sword  through the dog.    After that he lifted up the cradle to look for his child, and found the  body of a big wolf underneath that Gelert had slain, and his child was  safe. Gelert had capsized the cradle in the scuffle.    \"Oh, Gelert! Oh, Gelert!\" said the prince, \"my favourite hound, my  favourite hound! Thou hast been slain by thy master's hand, and in death  thou hast licked thy master's hand!\" He patted the dog, but it was too  late, and poor Gelert died licking his master's hand.    Next day they made a coffin, and had a regular funeral, the same as if  it were a human being; all the servants in deep mourning, and everybody.  They made him a grave, and the village was called after the dog,  Beth-Gelert--Gelert's Grave; and the prince planted a tree, and put a  gravestone of slate, though it was before the days of quarries. And they  are to be seen to this day.          ORIGIN OF THE WELSH.    Many years ago there lived several wild tribes round the King of  Persia's city, and the king's men were always annoying and harassing  them, exacting yearly a heavy tribute. Now these tribes, though very  brave in warfare, could not hold their own before the Persian army  when sent out against them, so that they paid their yearly tribute  grudgingly, but took revenge, whenever they could, upon travellers to or  from the city, robbing and killing them.    At last one of the tribesmen, a clever old chieftain, thought of a  cunning plan whereby to defeat the Persians, and free themselves from  the yearly tribute. And this was his scheme:    The wild wastes where these tribes lived were infested with large  birds called \"Rohs\", [Footnote: Pronounced softly.] which were very  destructive to human beings--devouring men, women, and children greedily  whenever they could catch them. Such a terror were they that the tribes  had to protect their village with high walls, [Footnote: Can this have  anything to do with the idea of walling-in the cuckoo?] and then  they slept securely, for the Roh hunted by night. This old chieftain  determined to watch the birds, and find out their nesting-places; so he  had a series of towers built, in which the watchmen could sleep securely  by night. These towers were advanced in whatever direction the birds  were seen to congregate by night. The observers reported that the Roh  could not fly, but ran very swiftly, being fleeter than any horse.    At length, by watching, their nesting-places were found in a sandy  plain, and it was discovered that those monstrous birds stole sheep and  cattle in great numbers.    The chieftain then gave orders for the watchmen to keep on guard until  the young birds were hatched, when they were commanded to secure fifty,  and bring them into the walled town. The order was carried out, and one  night they secured fifty young birds just out of the egg, and brought  them to the town.    The old chieftain then told off fifty skilful warriors, a man to each  bird, to his son being allotted the largest bird. These warriors were  ordered to feed the birds on flesh, and to train them for battle. The  birds grew up as tame as horses. Saddles and bridles were made for them,  and they were trained and exercised just like chargers.    When the next tribute day came round, the King of Persia sent his  emissaries to collect the tax, but the chieftains of the tribes insulted  and defied them, so that they returned to the king, who at once sent  forward his army.    The chieftain then marshalled his men, and forty-six of the Rohs were  drawn up in front of the army, the chief getting on the strongest bird.  The remaining four were placed on the right flank, and ordered at a  signal to advance and cut off the army, should they retreat.    The Rohs had small scales, like those of a fish, on their necks and  bodies, the scales being hidden under a soft hair, except on the upper  half of the neck. They had no feathers except on their wings. So they  were invulnerable except as to the eyes--for in those days the Persians  only had bows and arrows, and light javelins. When the Persian army  advanced, the Rohs advanced at lightning speed, and made fearful havoc,  the birds murdering and trampling the soldiers under foot, and beating  them down with their powerful wings. In less than two hours half the  Persian army was slain, and the rest had escaped. The tribes returned to  their walled towns, delighted with their victory.    When the news of his defeat reached the King of Persia he was wroth  beyond expression, and could not sleep for rage. So the next morning he  called for his magician.    \"What are you going to do with the birds?\" asked the king.    \"Well, I've been thinking the matter over,\" replied the magician.    \"Cannot you destroy all of them?\"    \"No, your majesty; I cannot destroy them, for I have not the power; but  I can get rid of them in one way; for though I cannot put out life, I  have the power of turning one life into some other living creature.\"    \"Well, what will you turn them into?\" asked the king.    \"I'll consider to-night, your majesty,\" replied the magician.    \"Well, mind and be sure to do it.\"    \"Yes, I'll be sure to do it, your majesty.\"            *       *       *       *       *    The next day, at ten, the magician appeared before the king, who asked:    \"Have you considered well?\"    \"Yes, your majesty.\"    \"Well, how are you going to act?\"    \"Your majesty, I've thought and thought during the night, and the best  thing we can do is to turn all the birds into fairies.\"    \"What are fairies?\" asked the king.    \"I've planned it all out, and I hope your majesty will agree.\"    \"Oh! I'll agree, as long as they never molest us more.\"    \"Well, your majesty, I'm going to turn them to fairies--small living  creatures to live in caves in the bowels of the earth, and they shall  only visit people living on the earth once a year. They shall be  harmless, and hurt nothing; they shall be fairies, and do nothing  but dance and sing, and I shall allow them to go about on earth for  twenty-four hours once a year and play their antics, but they shall do  no mischief.\"    \"How long are the birds to remain in that state?\" asked the king.    \"I'll give them 2,000 years, your majesty; and at the end of that time  they are to go back into birds, as they were before. And after the birds  change from the fairy state back into birds, they shall never breed  more, but die a natural death.\"    So the tribes lost their birds, and the King of Persia made such fearful  havoc amongst them that they decided to leave the country.    They travelled, supporting themselves by robbery; until they came to  a place where they built a city, and called it Troy, where they were  besieged for a long time.    At length the besiegers built a large caravan, with a large man's  head in front; the head was all gilded with gold. When the caravan was  finished they put 150 of the best warriors inside, provided with food,  and one of them had a trumpet. Then they pulled the caravan, which ran  upon eight broad wheels, up to the gates of the city, and left it there,  their army being drawn up in a valley near by. It was, agreed that  when the caravan got inside the gates the bugler should blow three loud  blasts to warn, the army, who would immediately advance into the city.    The men on the ramparts saw this curious caravan, and they began  wondering what it was, and for two or three days they left it alone.    At last an old chieftain said, \"It must be their food.\"    On the third day they opened the gates, and attaching ropes, began to  haul it into the city; then the warriors leaped out, and the horn blew,  and the army hurried up, and the town was taken after great slaughter;  but a number escaped with their wives and children, and fled on to the  Crimea, whence they were driven by the Russians, so they marched away  along the sea to Spain, and bearing up through France, they stopped.  Some wanted to go across the sea, and some stayed in the heart of  France: they were the Bretoons. [Footnote: Bretons.] The others came  on over in boats, and landed in England, and they were the first people  settled in Great Britain: they were the Welsh.          CROWS.
