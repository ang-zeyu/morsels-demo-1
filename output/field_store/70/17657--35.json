A Sex Difference          When men in Congress come to blows at something someone said,      I always notice that it shows their blood is quick and red;      But if two women disagree, with very little noise,      It proves, and this seems strange to me, that women have no poise.          Advice to Heroines      I        A heroine must shrink and cling        When heroes are about,      And thus the watching world will think:        \"How brave his heart and stout!\"      But if he chance to be away        When bright-faced dangers shine,      It will be best for her to play        The oak-tree, not the vine.      In fact the most important thing      Is knowing when it's time to cling.      II    _With apologies to R.L.S._        A heroine must be polite      And do what others say is right,      And think men wise and formidable--      At least as far as she is able.

If you will recollect our wedding day      You vowed on that occasion to obey.\"      \"I do recall the day,\" said she, \"and how      Me with your worldly goods you did endow.\"      \"That,\" he replied, \"is palpably absurd----\"      \"You mean you did not mean to keep your word?\"      \"O, yes,\" he answered, \"in a general way.\"      \"And that,\" said she, \"is how I meant obey.\"          If They Meant All They Said          Charm is a woman's strongest arm;      My charwoman is full of charm;      I chose her, not for strength of arm      But for her strange elusive charm.        And how tears heighten woman's powers!      My typist weeps for hours and hours:      I took her for her weeping powers--      They so delight my business hours.        A woman lives by intuition.      Though my accountant shuns addition      She has the rarest intuition.      (And I myself can do addition.)        Timidity in girls is nice.

What critic could object to that?      But to spend two precious hours      At a lecture! Oh, my powers,        The home is all a woman needs to learn.      And an hour, or a quarter,      Spent in voting! Why, my daughter,        You could not find your home on your return.          Evolution          Said Mr. Jones in 1910:      \"Women, subject yourselves to men.\"      Nineteen-Eleven heard him quote:      \"They rule the world without the vote.\"      By Nineteen-Twelve, he would submit      \"When all the women wanted it.\"      By Nineteen-Thirteen, looking glum,      He said that it was bound to come.      This year I heard him say with pride:      \"No reasons on the other side!\"      By Nineteen-Fifteen, he'll insist      He's always been a suffragist.      And what is really stranger, too,      He'll think that what he says is true.

It seems to me so clear,            That women's highest sphere      Is being loving wives and patient mothers.

And you're going to say that you greatly fear        I don't understand a woman's sphere;      Now aren't you honestly?\" \"Yes,\" he said.        \"I know what you're going to say,\" she said,        \"You're going to ask what I hope to gain        By stepping down to the dusty plain,      By seeking a stone when I might have bread;        You're going to say: 'Can a vote replace        The tender force of a woman's grace?'

I went to ask my government if they would set me free,      They gave a pardoned crook a vote, but hadn't one for me;      The men about me laughed and frowned and said: \"Go home, because      We really can't be bothered when we're busy making laws.\"        Oh, it's women this, and women that and women have no sense,      But it's pay your taxes promptly when it comes to the expense,      It comes to the expense, my dears, it comes to the expense,      It's pay your taxes promptly when it comes to the expense.        I went into a factory to earn my daily bread:      Men said: \"The home is woman's sphere.\" \"I have no home,\" I said.      But when the men all marched to war, they cried to wife and maid,      \"Oh, never mind about the home, but save the export trade.\"        For it's women this and women that, and home's the place for you,      But it's patriotic angels when there's outside work to do,      There's outside work to do, my dears, there's outside work to do,      It's patriotic angels when there's outside work to do.        We are not really senseless, and we are not angels, too,      But very human beings, human just as much as you.      It's hard upon occasions to be forceful and sublime      When you're treated as incompetents three-quarters of the time.        But it's women this and women that, and woman's like a hen,      But it's do the country's work alone, when war takes off the men,      And it's women this and women that and everything you please,      But woman is observant, and be sure that woman sees.          Beware!          In the days that are gone when a statue was wanted        In park or museum where statues must be,      A chivalrous male would come forward undaunted        And say: \"If you must have one, make it of me.      Bad though they be, yet I'll agree      If you must make them, why make them of me.\"        But chivalry's dead, as I always expected        Since women would not let things stay as they were;      So now, I suppose, when a statue's erected        Men will say brutally: \"Make it of her.\"      She may prefer things as they were      When they start making the statues of her.

Look not without, as the fool may do;      It is in thee and ever created anew.    In 1797--_Hermann and Dorothea_ was just then under way--Goethe and  Schiller interchanged views by letter on the subject of epic poetry in  general and the ballad in particular. As they had both written ballads  in their youth, it was but natural that they should be led to fresh  experiments with the species. So they both began to make ballads for  next year's _Musenalmanach_. Schiller contributed five, among them the  famous _Diver_ and _The Cranes of Ibycus_. In after years he wrote  several more, of which the best, perhaps, are _The Pledge_, a stirring  version of the Damon and Pythias story, and _The Battle with the  Dragon_, which, however, was called a romanza instead of a ballad. The  interest of all these poems turns mainly, of course, on the story, but  also, in no small degree, on the splendid art which the poet displays.  They are quite unlike any earlier German ballads, owing nothing to the  folk-song and making no use of the uncanny, the gruesome, or the  supernatural. There is no mystery in them, no resort to verbal tricks  such as Buerger had employed in _Lenore_. The subjects are not derived  from German folk-lore, but from Greek legend or medieval romance.  Their great merit is the strong and vivid, yet always noble, style  with which the details are set forth.    [Illustration: THE CHURCH IN WHICH SCHILLER WAS MARRIED]    We come back now to the province of art in which Schiller himself felt  that his strength lay, and to which he devoted nearly all his strength  during his remaining years. The very successful performance of the  complete _Wallenstein_ in the spring of 1799 added greatly to his  prestige, for discerning judges could see that something extraordinary  had been achieved. Weimar had by this time become the acknowledged  centre of German letters, and its modest little theatre now took on  fresh glory. Schiller had made himself very useful as a translator and  adapter, and Goethe was disposed to lean heavily on his friend's  superior knowledge of stage-craft. In order to be nearer to the  theatre and its director, Schiller moved over to Weimar in December,  1799, and took up his abode in what is now called the Schillerstrasse.  He was already working at _Mary Stuart_, which was finished the  following spring and first played on June 14, 1800.    In _Mary Stuart_, as in _Wallenstein_, Schiller focused his light on a  famous personage who was the subject of passionate controversy. But of  course he did not wish to make a Catholic play, or a Protestant play,  or to have its effect dependent in any way on the spectator's  pre-assumed attitude toward the purely political questions involved.  So he decided to omit Mary's trial and to let the curtain rise on her  as a prisoner waiting for the verdict of her judges. This meant,  however, according to his conception of the tragic art, a pathetic  rather than a tragic situation; for the queen's fate would be a  foregone conclusion, and she could do nothing to avert it. To give her  the semblance of a tragic guilt he resorted to three unhistorical  inventions: First, an attempt to escape, with resulting complicity in  the act of the murderous Catholic fanatic Mortimer; second, a putative  love on the part of Mary for Leicester, who would use his great  influence to bring about a personal interview between her and  Elizabeth; and, finally, the meeting of the two queens, in which  Mary's long pent-up passion would get the better of her discretion and  betray her into a mortal insult of her rival. In reality, however, the  meeting of the two queens, while theatrically very effective, is not  the true climax of the play. That comes when Mary conquers her  rebellious spirit and accepts her ignominious fate as a divinely  appointed expiation for long-past sins. The play thus becomes a  tragedy of moral self-conquest in the presence of an undeserved death.    Next in order came _The Maid of Orleans_, expressly called by its  author a romantic tragedy. It is a \"rescue\" of the Maid's character.  Shakespeare had depicted her as a witch, Voltaire as a vulgar fraud.  Schiller conceives her as a genuine ambassadress of God, or rather of  the Holy Virgin. Not only does he accept at its face value the  tradition of her \"voices,\" her miraculous clairvoyance, her magic  influence on the French troops; but he makes her fight in the ranks  with men and gives to her a terrible avenging sword, before which no  Englishman can stand. But she, too, had to have her tragic guilt. So  Schiller makes her supernatural power depend--by the Virgin's express  command--on her renunciation of the love of man. A fleeting passion  for the English general Lionel, conceived on the battle-field in the  fury of combat, fills her with remorse and the sense of treason to her  high mission. For a while she is deprived of her self-confidence, and  with it of her supernatural power. There follow scenes of bitter  humiliation, until her expiation is complete. At last, purified by  suffering, she recovers her divine strength, breaks her fetters,  brings victory once more to the disheartened French soldiers, and dies  in glory on the field of battle. One sees that it is not at all the  real Jeanne d'Arc that Schiller depicts, but a glorified heroine  invested with divine power and called to be the savior of her country.  Here, for the first time in German drama, the passion of patriotism  plays an important part.    After the completion of _The Maid of Orleans_ Schiller was minded to  try his hand on a tragedy \"in the strictest Greek form.\" He had been  deeply impressed by the art of Sophocles and wished to create  something which should produce on the modern mind the effect of a  Greek tragedy, with its simple structure, its few characters, and  above all its chorus. But the choice of a subject was not easy, and  for several months he occupied himself with other matters. He made a  German version of Gozzi's _Turandot_ and took notes for a tragedy  about Perkin Warbeck. In the summer of 1802 he decided definitely to  carry out his plan of vying with the Greeks. _The Bride of Messina_  was finished in February, 1803. While he was working at it there  arrived one day--it was in November, 1802--a patent of nobility from  the chancelry of the Holy Roman Empire. It may be noted in passing  that several years before he had been made an honorary citizen of the  French Republic, his name having been presented at the same time with  those of Washington, Wilberforce, and Kosciusko.    Among the later plays of Schiller _The Bride of Messina_ is the one  which shows his stately poetic diction at its best, but has proved  least acceptable on the stage. As we have seen, it was an artistic  experiment. A medieval prince of Messina has an ominous dream which is  interpreted by an Arab astrologer to mean that a daughter to be born  will cause the death of his two sons, thus making an end of his  dynasty. When the child is born he orders it put to death. But  meanwhile his queen has had a dream of contrary import, and thereby  saves the life of her new-born daughter, but has her brought up remote  from the court. In time the two quarrelsome brothers, ignorant that  they have a sister, fall in love with the girl. One slays the other in  a frenzy of jealous rage, the other commits suicide in remorse. This  invention can hardly be called plausible. Indeed, so far as the mere  fable is concerned, it is a house of cards which would collapse any  moment at the breath of common sense. One must remember in reading the  play that common sense was not one of the nine muses. The dreams take  the place of the Delphic oracle, and the Greek chorus is represented  by two semi-choruses, the retainers of the quarreling brothers, who  speak their parts by the mouth of a leader, at one moment taking part  in the action, at another delivering the detached comment of the ideal  spectator. There is much splendid poetry in these pseudo-choruses, but  it was impossible that such a scheme should produce the effect of  the Greek choral dance.    Did Schiller feel that in _The Bride of Messina_ he had wandered a  little too far away from the vital concerns of modern life? Probably,  for he next set to work on a play which should be popular in the best  sense of the word--_William Tell_. It is his one play with a happy  ending and has always been a prime favorite on the stage. The hero is  the Swiss people, and the action idealizes the legendary uprising of  the Forest Cantons against their Austrian governors. There are really  three separate actions: the conspiracy, the love-affair of Bertha and  Rudenz, the exploits of William Tell. All, however, contribute to the  common end, which is the triumph of the Swiss people over their  oppressors. The exposition is superb, there is rapidity of movement,  variety, picturesqueness, the glamor of romance; and the feelings  evoked are such as warm and keep warm the cockles of the heart. When  the famous actor Iffland received the manuscript of the first act, in  February, 1804, he wrote:    \"I have read, devoured, bent my knee; and my heart, my tears, my  rushing blood, have paid ecstatic homage to your spirit, to your  heart. Oh, more! Soon, soon more! Pages, scraps--whatever you can  send. I tender heart and hand to your genius. What a work! What  wealth, power, poetic beauty, and irresistible force! God keep you!  Amen.\"    With _Tell_ off his hands Schiller next threw his tireless energy on a  Russian subject--the story of Dmitri, reputed son of Ivan the  Terrible. The reading, note-taking and planning proved a long  laborious task, and there were many interruptions. In November, 1804,  the hereditary Prince of Weimar brought home a Russian"]]]
