[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#3)"],[1," first nonsense verses, published in 1846, are written in the  form of the well-known stanza beginning:      There was an old man of Tobago.    This type of stanza, known as the \"Limerick,\" is said by a gentleman  who speaks with authority to have flourished in the reign of William  IV. This is one of several he remembers as current at his public  school in 1834:      There was a young man at St. Kitts    Who was very much troubled with fits;        The eclipse of the moon        Threw him into a swoon,    When he tumbled and broke into bits.    Lear distinctly asserts that this form of verse was not invented by  him, but was suggested by a friend as a useful model for amusing  rhymes. It proved so in his case, for he published no less than two  hundred and twelve of these \"Limericks.\"    In regard to his verses, Lear asserted that \"nonsense, pure and  absolute,\" was his aim throughout; and remarked, further, that to  have been the means of administering innocent mirth to thousands was  surely a just excuse for satisfaction. He pursued his aim with  scrupulous consistency, and his absurd conceits are fantastic and  ridiculous, but never cheaply or vulgarly funny.    Twenty-five years after his first book came out, Lear published  other books of nonsense verse and prose, with pictures which are  irresistibly mirth-provoking. Lear's nonsense songs, while retaining  all the ludicrous merriment of his Limericks, have an added quality  of poetic harmony. They are distinctly _singable_, and many of them  have been set to music by talented composers. Perhaps the best-known  songs are \"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat\" and \"The Daddy-Long-Legs and  the Fly.\"    Lear himself composed airs for \"The Pelican Chorus\" and \"The  Yonghy-Bonghy Bo,\" which were arranged for the piano by Professor Pom√®,  of San Remo, Italy.    Although like Lear's in some respects, Lewis Carroll's nonsense is  perhaps of a more refined type. There is less of the grotesque and  more poetic imagery. But though Carroll was more of a poet than Lear,  both had the true sense of nonsense. Both assumed the most absurd  conditions, and proceeded to detail their consequences with a simple  seriousness that convulses appreciative readers, and we find  ourselves uncertain whether it is the manner or the matter that is  more amusing.    Lewis Carroll was a man of intellect and education; his funniest  sayings are often based on profound knowledge or deep thought. Like  Lear, he never spoiled his quaint fancies by over-exaggerating their  quaintness or their fancifulness, and his ridiculous plots are as  carefully conceived, constructed, and elaborated as though they  embodied the soundest facts. No funny detail is ever allowed to  become _too_ funny; and it is in this judicious economy of  extravagance that his genius is shown. As he remarks in one of his  own poems:      Then, fourthly, there are epithets        That suit with any word--    As well as Harvey's Reading Sauce        With fish, or flesh, or bird.    Such epithets, like pepper,        Give zest to what you write;    And, if you strew them sparely,        They whet the appetite;    But if you lay them on too thick,        You spoil the matter quite!    Both Lear and Carroll suffered from the undiscerning critics who  persisted in seeing in their nonsense a hidden meaning, a cynical,  political, or other intent, veiled under the apparent foolery. Lear  takes occasion to deny this in the preface to one of his books, and  asserts not only that his rhymes and pictures have no symbolical  meaning, but that he \"took more care than might be supposed to make  the subjects incapable of such misinterpretation.\"    Likewise, \"Jabberwocky\" was declared by one critic to be a  translation from the German, and by others its originality was  doubted. The truth is, that it was written by Lewis Carroll at an  evening party; it was quite impromptu, and no ulterior meaning was  intended. \"The Hunting of the Snark\" was also regarded by some as an  allegory, or, perhaps, a burlesque on a celebrated case, in which  the _Snark_ was used as a personification of popularity, but Lewis  Carroll protested that the poem had no meaning at all.    A favorite trick of the Nonsensists is the coining of words to suit  their needs, and Lear and Carroll are especially happy in their  inventions of this kind.    Lear gives us such gems as scroobious, meloobious, ombliferous,  borascible, slobaciously, himmeltanious, flumpetty, and mumbian;  while the best of Lewis Carroll's coined words are those found in  \"Jabberwocky.\"    Another of the great Nonsensists is W. S. Gilbert. Unlike Lear or  Carroll, his work is not characterized by absurd words or phrases;  he prefers a still wider scope, and invents a ridiculous plot. The  \"Bab Ballads,\" as well as Mr. Gilbert's comic opera librettos, hinge  upon schemes of ludicrous impossibility, which are treated as the  most natural proceedings in the world. The best known of the  \"Bab Ballads\" is no doubt \"The Yarn of the 'Nancy Bell,'\" which was  long since set to music and is still a popular song. In addition to  his talent for nonsense, Mr. Gilbert possesses a wonderful rhyming  facility, and juggles cleverly with difficult and unusual metres.    In regard to his \"Bab Ballads,\" Mr. Gilbert gravely says that  \"they are not, as a rule, founded on fact,\" and, remembering their  gory and often cannibalistic tendencies, we are grateful for this  assurance. An instance of Gilbert's appreciation of other people's  nonsense is his parody of Lear's verse:      There was an old man in a tree    Who was horribly bored by a bee;        When they said, \"Does it buzz?\"        He replied, \"Yes, it does!    It's a regular brute of a bee!\"    The parody attributed to Gilbert is called \"A Nonsense Rhyme in  Blank Verse\":      There was an old man of St. Bees,    Who was stung in the arm by a wasp;        When they asked, \"Does it hurt?\"        He replied, \"No, it doesn't,    But I thought all the while 'twas a Hornet!\"    Thackeray wrote spirited nonsense, but much of it had an  under-meaning, political or otherwise, which bars it from the field  of sheer nonsense.    The sense of nonsense is no respecter of persons; even staid old  Dr. Johnson possessed it, though his nonsense verses are marked by  credible fact and irrefutable logic. Witness these two examples:      As with my hat upon my head        I walked along the Strand,    I there did meet another man        With his hat in his hand.        The tender infant, meek and mild,        Fell down upon the stone;    The nurse took up the squealing child,        But still the child squealed on.    The Doctor is also responsible for      If a man who turnips cries,        Cry not when his father dies,    'Tis a proof that he would rather        Have a turnip than a father.    And indeed, among our best writers there are few who have not  dropped into nonsense or semi-nonsense at one time or another.    A familiar bit of nonsense prose is by S. Foote, and it is said that  Charles Macklin used to recite it with great gusto:      \"She went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make    an apple-pie, and at the same time a great she-bear coming    up the street, pops its head into the shop. 'What, no    soap?' so he died. She imprudently married the barber,    and there were present the Pickaninnies, the Joblilies, the    Gayrulies, and the Grand Panjandrum himself with the little    round button on top, and they all fell to playing         catch-as-catch-can    till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their    boots.\"    [Transcriber's note: The above paragraph is not an excerpt from a  longer work, but is complete as it stands.]    An old nonsense verse attributed to an Oxford student, is the well  known:      A centipede was happy quite,        Until a frog in fun    Said, \"Pray, which leg comes after which?\"    This raised her mind to such a pitch,    She lay distracted in the ditch        Considering how to run.    So far as we know, Kipling has never printed anything which can be  called nonsense verse, but it is doubtless only a question of time  when that branch shall be added to his versatility. His \"Just So\"  stories are capital nonsense prose, and the following rhyme proves  him guilty of at least one Limerick:      There was a small boy of Quebec,    Who was buried in snow to his neck;        When they said, \"Are you friz?\"        He replied, \"Yes, I is--    But we don't call this cold in Quebec.\"    Among living authors, one who has written a great amount of good  nonsense is Mr. Gelett Burgess, late editor of _The Lark_.    According to Mr. Burgess' own statement, the test of nonsense is its  quotability, and his work stands this test admirably, for what  absurd rhyme ever attained such popularity as his \"Purple Cow\"? This  was first printed in _The Lark_, a paper published in San  Francisco for two years, the only periodical of any merit that has  ever made intelligent nonsense its special feature.    Another of the most talented nonsense writers of to-day is Mr. Oliver  Herford. It is a pity, however, to reproduce his verse without his  illustrations, for as nonsense these are as admirable as the text.  But the greater part of Mr. Herford's work belongs to the realm  of pure fancy, and though of a whimsical delicacy often equal to  Lewis Carroll's, it is rarely sheer nonsense.    As a proof that good nonsense is by no means an easy achievement,  attention is called to a recent competition inaugurated by the  London _Academy_.    Nonsense rhymes similar to those quoted from _The Lark_ were asked  for, and though many were received, it is stated that no brilliant  results were among them.    The prize was awarded to this weak and uninteresting specimen:      \"If half the road was made of jam,        The other half of bread,    How very nice my walks would be,\"        The greedy infant said.    These two were also offered by competitors:      I love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#3)"],[1,"record, dated 1757, the place was styled \"Fort  Cannatchocary,\" and mentioned as a prospering settlement. Incorporated as  a town in 1788, its population has been rapidly increasing since then,  and now is estimated to amount to more than 3,000.    It was a glorious morning, the 24th of July, as we left Canajoharie. The  sun rose up into a cloudless heaven and poured a flood of gorgeous  splendor over the landscape, as if proud of the realm he shone upon.    When I entered the pilot-house I found Mr. James, in the absence of the  captain, busy steering the yacht, and in the course of our long voyage I  often had opportunity to admire his abilities as a navigator. On many  occasions I observed that he was very cautious in all his proceedings;  that he took nothing for granted, and was only convinced of a fact when  properly certified by ocular demonstration.    Engaged in a French conversation with the dexterous commodore, the time,  as well as the vessel, was rapidly gliding along; the latter being  assisted by a little breeze that rippled the surface of the water. So,  after a three miles' ride, we approached _Fort Plain_, which boasts of  numerous factories, and also the largest spring and axle works of the  world. The Clinton Liberal Institute, one of the leading military schools  of the State, occupies a commanding position, overlooking the valley. The  site of old Fort Plain, of revolutionary memory, is within the village  limits.    Having passed Cox and Mindenville, a route of nine miles brought us into  the proximity of the busy town of _Little Falls_, which has a population  of about 10,000. It is romantically situated, and many elegant dwellings  stand upon steep acclivities, commanding views of grand and attractive  sceneries. The chief products of the numerous manufactories are knit  goods. Little Falls is also one of the principal cheese markets of the  Empire State. The Mohawk river supplies the place with abundant  water-power, having at this point a fall of forty-five feet in half a  mile.    Still proceeding on our voyage, the town was soon out of sight. The sun  shone with the clearest splendor from the zenith, beautifully illumining  the smiling valleys, wooded hills, sparkling brooks and dimpled lakes,  which makes this landscape scene so attractive. We were unable to leave  our seats on the stern-deck; for everything around us seemed to have  assumed the character of enchantment, and--had I been educated in the  Grecian mythology--I should scarcely have been surprised to find an  assemblage of Dryads, Naiads and Oreads sporting on the plain beside us.    After having viewed Mohawk, eight miles from Little Falls; Herkimer, a  town of about 5,000 inhabitants; Ilion, with a population of nearly the  same number, and Frankfort, four miles from Utica, we reached the latter  city as       \"The sunset gorgeous dyes,      Paled slowly from the skies,\"    having achieved forty-two miles that day.    _Utica_ contains approximately 47,000 residents. At the time of the  revolution it was a frontier trading-post and the site of Fort Schuyler,  built to guard the settlements against the French and Indians.    We made arrangements to remain in this city over night.    A long walk through Utica made us acquainted with a regular and handsomely  built city, which rises from the south bank of the Mohawk River to an  elevation of 150 feet. Among the stately buildings are six large hotels,  the handsome city hall, the postoffice and the bank edifice. There is also  a State Lunatic Asylum. Utica, being in the center of a great dairy  region, has become the most important cheese market in the United States.    Genesee Street is the principal thoroughfare lined with large blocks of  commercial houses.    The city has not yet attained its centennial; but during its history of  less than a century it has experienced a wonderful growth, especially  during the last fifty years.    At 7 o'clock the next morning we resumed our voyage, sailing on the  so-called sixty mile level; having thus the delightful prospect not to  be detained by going through numerous locks.    We were also _in limine_ of the far-famed lake region, and soon traversed  one of the finest portions of New York State.    Passing the hamlets of York Mills, Whitesboro and Oriskany, the  \"Marguerite\" advanced near to the city of _Rome_ towards 10 o'clock A.M.  In its vicinity the famous battle of Oriskany was fought; and Fort  Stanwix, which was besieged by the British in 1777, occupies a site now in  the center of the city of Rome. The latter is laid out with wide streets  well shaded with maples and elms. In the resident portion, a very high  artistic taste has been displayed in the erection of dwelling houses.  Although this thriving city of almost 16,000 inhabitants has not so many  points of interest as its namesake, the ancient metropolis of the glorious  Roman empire, whose wealth of antiquities is perfectly marvelous and whose  relics of classical and papal times are alike almost innumerable; still it  possesses one interesting feature that ought not to be left unmentioned:  It was here that cheese was first made in factories.    Other important manufactures are merchantable iron, brass and copper,  locomotives and agricultural implements.    Greatly favored by the clemency of the weather, we sped through this  beautiful region, which is a never ending source of interest to the  tourist, sailing past New London, Grove Springs, Higginsville, Dunbarton,  State Bridge, Durhamville, Lenox Basin, Canastota, New Boston,  Chittenango, Bolivar, Pool's Brook, Kirkville, Manlius and Lodi. At the  latter place the bed of the canal suddenly widens considerably, being  about twice its average width. Entering that portion of the grand  artificial waterway, we found its waters so shallow that we could plainly  discern its rocky bed.    We entered the city of _Syracuse_ when the last streak of daylight had  faded from the west and the blush on the waters was followed by the  reflection of the far blue arch and its starry host.    Opposite the city hall, a magnificent structure, the \"Marguerite\" was made  fast to repose after a fifty-five miles' course that day.    Syracuse, situated in the heart of New York State, has been appropriately  named the \"Central City.\" Its wonderful growth for the past twenty years  entitles it to rank amongst the foremost cities of the East. It has a  population of nearly 100,000, and is one of the leading manufacturing  towns of the country. For a long period Syracuse practically controlled  the salt product of the United States; in fact, it was that which first  gave the place its importance. The existence of the vast salt springs of  Onondaga was known to the Indians at an early date, and the secret was by  them imparted to the Jesuits in 1654. The State took possession of the  springs in 1794; and laws were passed for the conduct of the manufacture.  Although numerous companies are now engaged in this industry, it  constitutes a comparatively small factor in the commercial interests of  the city, inasmuch as it possesses at the present time over five hundred  industrial establishments; giving employment to not less than twenty  thousand people.    The city is handsomely laid out, containing many fine public buildings and  private residences.    When I came on deck the following morning the rain fell in heavy showers.  A cloud appeared to open directly over our heads, and let down the water  almost in one body, but at 7.15, as the violence of the rainfall had  somewhat abated, we departed from Syracuse, sailing past Geddes, Bell'isle  and Canton, where we struck another shallow place in the canal. As we  approached Peru the mists were rolling away, which gradually, as they  became thinner, received and transmitted the rays of the sun; illuminating  them with a golden radiance, increasing every minute in splendor, until  they vanished.    Therefore, it was a redoubled pleasure to glance at the green plains  studded with yet greener woodlands; the little mountains raising their  crests, and the lovely lakes gleaming like floods of molten silver.    Thus we journeyed along past Weedsport, Centerport, Port Byron, Montezuma,  Pitt Lock, Clyde and Lock Berlin.    Nearly midway between Syracuse and Rochester, forty-nine miles from the  former city, we halted, choosing _Lyons_ for our night's lodging. The  town, having a population of almost 6,000, is the seat of Wayne County,  which produces more dried fruit than any other county in the State. The  oil of peppermint forms an important product of manufacture, there being a  score of peppermint distilleries yielding annually more than 100,000  pounds of this costly oil.    Thursday, the 27th of July, as the tints of a bright morning reddened the  eastern sky, we pursued our journey, greatly delighted with the cool and  refreshing atmosphere. Speeding along we passed Arcadia; Newark, a  thriving town, numbering about 4,000 inhabitants; and Palmyra, seven miles  beyond, with broad and well shaded streets.    Two miles south of _Palmyra_ Joe Smith, the founder of Mormonism, claimed  to have dug from a hill, which now bears the name of Mormon Hill, the  golden plates constituting the first Mormon Bible.    Sailing by the villages of Lower and Upper Macedon, Pittsford was reached;  a beautiful town of more than 3,000 inhabitants and one of the oldest  settlements in that part of the State. Here is located the famous  \"Pittsford Farm,\" which is one of the finest stock farms in the East. It  is at this place that Shetland ponies, Jersey cattle and Angora cats are  raised in great numbers. Uncountable varieties of water-fowl can always be  seen at this point.    Having passed Brighton, we arrived at _Rochester_ long ere the first gold  dye of sunset was stealing into the vast blue arch on high, having  traveled forty-two miles that day.    Near the center of the city destined for our"]]]
