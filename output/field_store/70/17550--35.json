Then, gaining his  feet, he waded to the bank, the little fish speeding hither and thither,  all frightened at his splashing.    \"Give me thy hand,\" cried he, when he had reached the bank. \"I must  needs own thou art a brave and a sturdy soul and, withal, a good stout  stroke with the cudgels. By this and by that, my head hummeth like to a  hive of bees on a hot June day.\"    Then he clapped his horn to his lips and winded a blast that went  echoing sweetly down the forest paths. \"Ay, marry,\" quoth he again,  \"thou art a tall lad, and eke a brave one, for ne'er, I bow, is there a  man betwixt here and Canterbury Town could do the like to me that thou  hast done.\"    \"And thou,\" quoth the stranger, laughing, \"takest thy cudgeling like a  brave heart and a stout yeoman.\"    But now the distant twigs and branches rustled with the coming of men,  and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln  green, burst from out the covert, with merry Will Stutely at their head.    \"Good master,\" cried Will, \"how is this? Truly thou art all wet from  head to foot, and that to the very skin.\"    \"Why, marry,\" answered jolly Robin, \"yon stout fellow hath tumbled me  neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside.\"    \"Then shall he not go without a ducking and eke a drubbing himself!\"  cried Will Stutely. \"Have at him, lads!\"    Then Will and a score of yeomen leaped upon the stranger, but though  they sprang quickly they found him ready and felt him strike right and  left with his stout staff, so that, though he went down with press of  numbers, some of them rubbed cracked crowns before he was overcome.    \"Nay, forbear!\" cried Robin, laughing until his sore sides ached again.  \"He is a right good man and true, and no harm shall befall him. Now  hark ye, good youth, wilt thou stay with me and be one of my band? Three  suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have each year, beside forty marks in  fee, and share with us whatsoever good shall befall us. Thou shalt eat  sweet venison and quaff the stoutest ale, and mine own good right-hand  man shalt thou be, for never did I see such a cudgel player in all my  life before. Speak! Wilt thou be one of my good merry men?\"    \"That know I not,\" quoth the stranger surlily, for he was angry at being  so tumbled about. \"If ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than  ye do oaken cudgel, I wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my  country; but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than  I, then will I bethink me of joining with you.\"    \"Now by my faith,\" said Robin, \"thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah;  yet I will stoop to thee as I never stooped to man before. Good Stutely,  cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth, and set it  fourscore yards distant on yonder oak. Now, stranger, hit that fairly  with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer.\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I,\" answered he. \"Give me a good stout bow and a  fair broad arrow, and if I hit it not, strip me and beat me blue with  bowstrings.\"    Then he chose the stoutest bow among them all, next to Robin's own, and  a straight gray goose shaft, well-feathered and smooth, and stepping  to the mark--while all the band, sitting or lying upon the greensward,  watched to see him shoot--he drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the  shaft right deftly, sending it so straight down the path that it clove  the mark in the very center. \"Aha!\" cried he, \"mend thou that if thou  canst;\" while even the yeomen clapped their hands at so fair a shot.    \"That is a keen shot indeed,\" quoth Robin. \"Mend it I cannot, but mar it  I may, perhaps.\"    Then taking up his own good stout bow and nocking an arrow with care, he  shot with his very greatest skill. Straight flew the arrow, and so  true that it lit fairly upon the stranger's shaft and split it into  splinters. Then all the yeomen leaped to their feet and shouted for joy  that their master had shot so well.    \"Now by the lusty yew bow of good Saint Withold,\" cried the stranger,  \"that is a shot indeed, and never saw I the like in all my life before!  Now truly will I be thy man henceforth and for aye. Good Adam Bell(1)  was a fair shot, but never shot he so!\"           (1) Adam Bell, Clym o' the Clough, and William of Cloudesly       were three noted north-country bowmen whose names have been       celebrated in many ballads of the olden time.      \"Then have I gained a right good man this day,\" quoth jolly Robin. \"What  name goest thou by, good fellow?\"    \"Men call me John Little whence I came,\" answered the stranger.    Then Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up. \"Nay, fair little  stranger,\" said he, \"I like not thy name and fain would I have it  otherwise. Little art thou indeed, and small of bone and sinew,  therefore shalt thou be christened Little John, and I will be thy  godfather.\"    Then Robin Hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began  to grow angry.    \"An thou make a jest of me,\" quoth he to Will Stutely, \"thou wilt have  sore bones and little pay, and that in short season.\"    \"Nay, good friend,\" said Robin Hood, \"bottle thine anger, for the name  fitteth thee well. Little John shall thou be called henceforth, and  Little John shall it be. So come, my merry men, we will prepare a  christening feast for this fair infant.\"    So turning their backs upon the stream, they plunged into the forest  once more, through which they traced their steps till they reached the  spot where they dwelled in the depths of the woodland. There had they  built huts of bark and branches of trees, and made couches of sweet  rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer. Here stood a great oak  tree with branches spreading broadly around, beneath which was a seat of  green moss where Robin Hood was wont to sit at feast and at merrymaking  with his stout men about him. Here they found the rest of the band, some  of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. Then they all built great  fires and after a time roasted the does and broached a barrel of humming  ale. Then when the feast was ready they all sat down, but Robin placed  Little John at his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the second in  the band.    Then when the feast was done Will Stutely spoke up. \"It is now time, I  ween, to christen our bonny babe, is it not so, merry boys?\" And \"Aye!  Aye!\" cried all, laughing till the woods echoed with their mirth.    \"Then seven sponsors shall we have,\" quoth Will Stutely, and hunting  among all the band, he chose the seven stoutest men of them all.    \"Now by Saint Dunstan,\" cried Little John, springing to his feet, \"more  than one of you shall rue it an you lay finger upon me.\"    But without a word they all ran upon him at once, seizing him by his  legs and arms and holding him tightly in spite of his struggles, and  they bore him forth while all stood around to see the sport. Then one  came forward who had been chosen to play the priest because he had a  bald crown, and in his hand he carried a brimming pot of ale. \"Now, who  bringeth this babe?\" asked he right soberly.    \"That do I,\" answered Will Stutely.    \"And what name callest thou him?\"    \"Little John call I him.\"    \"Now Little John,\" quoth the mock priest, \"thou hast not lived  heretofore, but only got thee along through the world, but henceforth  thou wilt live indeed. When thou livedst not thou wast called John  Little, but now that thou dost live indeed, Little John shalt thou be  called, so christen I thee.\" And at these last words he emptied the pot  of ale upon Little John's head.    Then all shouted with laughter as they saw the good brown ale stream  over Little John's beard and trickle from his nose and chin, while his  eyes blinked with the smart of it. At first he was of a mind to be angry  but found he could not, because the others were so merry; so he, too,  laughed with the rest. Then Robin took this sweet, pretty babe, clothed  him all anew from top to toe in Lincoln green, and gave him a good stout  bow, and so made him a member of the merry band.    And thus it was that Robin Hood became outlawed; thus a band of merry  companions gathered about him, and thus he gained his right-hand man,  Little John; and so the prologue ends. And now I will tell how the  Sheriff of Nottingham three times sought to take Robin Hood, and how he  failed each time.          Robin Hood and the Tinker    Now it was told before how two hundred pounds were set upon Robin Hood's  head, and how the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would  seize Robin, both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and  because the slain man was a kinsman of his own. Now the Sheriff did not  yet know what a force Robin had about him in Sherwood, but thought that  he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man  that had broken the laws; therefore he offered fourscore golden angels  to anyone who would serve this warrant. But men of Nottingham Town knew  more of Robin Hood and his doings than the Sheriff did, and many laughed  to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw, knowing well that  all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns; so that no  one came forward to take the matter in hand. Thus a fortnight passed, in  which time none came forward to do the Sheriff's business. Then said he,  \"A right good reward have I offered to whosoever would serve my warrant  upon Robin Hood, and I marvel that no one has come to undertake the  task.\"    Then one of his men who was near him said, \"Good master, thou wottest  not the force that Robin Hood has about him and how little he cares for  warrant of king or sheriff.

Why guard the prison?\" cried the Orangists.    \"Stop,\" replied the Count, \"there you at once ask me more than I  can tell you. I was told, 'Guard the prison,' and I guard it. You,  gentlemen, who are almost military men yourselves, you are aware that an  order must never be gainsaid.\"    \"But this order has been given to you that the traitors may be enabled  to leave the town.\"    \"Very possibly, as the traitors are condemned to exile,\" replied Tilly.    \"But who has given this order?\"    \"The States, to be sure!\"    \"The States are traitors.\"    \"I don't know anything about that!\"    \"And you are a traitor yourself!\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes, you.\"    \"Well, as to that, let us understand each other gentlemen. Whom should  I betray? The States? Why, I cannot betray them, whilst, being in their  pay, I faithfully obey their orders.\"    As the Count was so indisputably in the right that it was impossible  to argue against him, the mob answered only by redoubled clamour and  horrible threats, to which the Count opposed the most perfect urbanity.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"uncock your muskets, one of them may go off by  accident; and if the shot chanced to wound one of my men, we should  knock over a couple of hundreds of yours, for which we should, indeed,  be very sorry, but you even more so; especially as such a thing is  neither contemplated by you nor by myself.\"    \"If you did that,\" cried the burghers, \"we should have a pop at you,  too.\"    \"Of course you would; but suppose you killed every man Jack of us, those  whom we should have killed would not, for all that, be less dead.\"    \"Then leave the place to us, and you will perform the part of a good  citizen.\"    \"First of all,\" said the Count, \"I am not a citizen, but an officer,  which is a very different thing; and secondly, I am not a Hollander, but  a Frenchman, which is more different still. I have to do with no one but  the States, by whom I am paid; let me see an order from them to leave  the place to you, and I shall only be too glad to wheel off in an  instant, as I am confoundedly bored here.\"    \"Yes, yes!\" cried a hundred voices; the din of which was immediately  swelled by five hundred others; \"let us march to the Town-hall; let us  go and see the deputies! Come along! come along!\"    \"That's it,\" Tilly muttered between his teeth, as he saw the most  violent among the crowd turning away; \"go and ask for a meanness at  the Town-hall, and you will see whether they will grant it; go, my fine  fellows, go!\"    The worthy officer relied on the honour of the magistrates, who, on  their side, relied on his honour as a soldier.    \"I say, Captain,\" the first lieutenant whispered into the ear of the  Count, \"I hope the deputies will give these madmen a flat refusal;  but, after all, it would do no harm if they would send us some  reinforcement.\"    In the meanwhile, John de Witt, whom we left climbing the stairs, after  the conversation with the jailer Gryphus and his daughter Rosa, had  reached the door of the cell, where on a mattress his brother Cornelius  was resting, after having undergone the preparatory degrees of the  torture. The sentence of banishment having been pronounced, there was no  occasion for inflicting the torture extraordinary.    Cornelius was stretched on his couch, with broken wrists and crushed  fingers. He had not confessed a crime of which he was not guilty; and  now, after three days of agony, he once more breathed freely, on being  informed that the judges, from whom he had expected death, were only  condemning him to exile.    Endowed with an iron frame and a stout heart, how would he have  disappointed his enemies if they could only have seen, in the dark cell  of the Buytenhof, his pale face lit up by the smile of the martyr, who  forgets the dross of this earth after having obtained a glimpse of the  bright glory of heaven.    The warden, indeed, had already recovered his full strength, much more  owing to the force of his own strong will than to actual aid; and he was  calculating how long the formalities of the law would still detain him  in prison.    This was just at the very moment when the mingled shouts of the  burgher guard and of the mob were raging against the two brothers, and  threatening Captain Tilly, who served as a rampart to them. This noise,  which roared outside of the walls of the prison, as the surf dashing  against the rocks, now reached the ears of the prisoner.    But, threatening as it sounded, Cornelius appeared not to deem it worth  his while to inquire after its cause; nor did he get up to look out  of the narrow grated window, which gave access to the light and to the  noise of the world without.    He was so absorbed in his never-ceasing pain that it had almost become a  habit with him. He felt with such delight the bonds which connected his  immortal being with his perishable frame gradually loosening, that it  seemed to him as if his spirit, freed from the trammels of the body,  were hovering above it, like the expiring flame which rises from the  half-extinguished embers.    He also thought of his brother; and whilst the latter was thus vividly  present to his mind the door opened, and John entered, hurrying to the  bedside of the prisoner, who stretched out his broken limbs and his  hands tied up in bandages towards that glorious brother, whom he now  excelled, not in services rendered to the country, but in the hatred  which the Dutch bore him.    John tenderly kissed his brother on the forehead, and put his sore hands  gently back on the mattress.    \"Cornelius, my poor brother, you are suffering great pain, are you not?\"    \"I am suffering no longer, since I see you, my brother.\"    \"Oh, my poor dear Cornelius! I feel most wretched to see you in such a  state.\"    \"And, indeed, I have thought more of you than of myself; and whilst they  were torturing me, I never thought of uttering a complaint, except once,  to say, 'Poor brother!' But now that you are here, let us forget all.  You are coming to take me away, are you not?\"    \"I am.\"    \"I am quite healed; help me to get up, and you shall see how I can  walk.\"    \"You will not have to walk far, as I have my coach near the pond, behind  Tilly's dragoons.\"    \"Tilly's dragoons! What are they near the pond for?\"    \"Well,\" said the Grand Pensionary with a melancholy smile which was  habitual to him, \"the gentlemen at the Town-hall expect that the  people at the Hague would like to see you depart, and there is some  apprehension of a tumult.\"    \"Of a tumult?\" replied Cornelius, fixing his eyes on his perplexed  brother; \"a tumult?\"    \"Yes, Cornelius.\"    \"Oh! that's what I heard just now,\" said the prisoner, as if speaking to  himself. Then, turning to his brother, he continued,--    \"Are there many persons down before the prison.\"    \"Yes, my brother, there are.\"    \"But then, to come here to me----\"    \"Well?\"    \"How is it that they have allowed you to pass?\"    \"You know well that we are not very popular, Cornelius,\" said the Grand  Pensionary, with gloomy bitterness. \"I have made my way through all  sorts of bystreets and alleys.\"    \"You hid yourself, John?\"    \"I wished to reach you without loss of time, and I did what people will  do in politics, or on the sea when the wind is against them,--I tacked.\"    At this moment the noise in the square below was heard to roar with  increasing fury. Tilly was parleying with the burghers.    \"Well, well,\" said Cornelius, \"you are a very skilful pilot, John; but I  doubt whether you will as safely guide your brother out of the Buytenhof  in the midst of this gale, and through the raging surf of popular  hatred, as you did the fleet of Van Tromp past the shoals of the Scheldt  to Antwerp.\"    \"With the help of God, Cornelius, we'll at least try,\" answered John;  \"but, first of all, a word with you.\"    \"Speak!\"    The shouts began anew.    \"Hark, hark!\" continued Cornelius, \"how angry those people are! Is it  against you, or against me?\"    \"I should say it is against us both, Cornelius. I told you, my dear  brother, that the Orange party, while assailing us with their absurd  calumnies, have also made it a reproach against us that we have  negotiated with France.\"    \"What blockheads they are!\"    \"But, indeed, they reproach us with it.\"    \"And yet, if these negotiations had been successful, they would have  prevented the defeats of Rees, Orsay, Wesel, and Rheinberg; the Rhine  would not have been crossed, and Holland might still consider herself  invincible in the midst of her marshes and canals.\"    \"All this is quite true, my dear Cornelius, but still more certain  it is, that if at this moment our correspondence with the Marquis de  Louvois were discovered, skilful pilot as I am, I should not be able to  save the frail barque which is to carry the brothers De Witt and their  fortunes out of Holland. That correspondence, which might prove to  honest people how dearly I love my country, and what sacrifices I have  offered to make for its liberty and glory, would be ruin to us if it  fell into the hands of the Orange party. I hope you have burned the  letters before you left Dort to join me at the Hague.\"    \"My dear brother,\" Cornelius answered, \"your correspondence with M. de  Louvois affords ample proof of your having been of late the greatest,  most generous, and most able citizen of the Seven United Provinces. I  rejoice in the glory of my country; and particularly do I rejoice  in your glory, John. I have taken good care not to burn that  correspondence.\"    \"Then we are lost, as far as this life is concerned,\" quietly said the  Grand Pensionary, approaching the window.    \"No, on the contrary, John, we shall at the same time save our lives and  regain our popularity.\"    \"But what have you done with these letters?\"    \"I have intrusted them to the care of Cornelius van Baerle, my godson,  whom you know, and"]]]
