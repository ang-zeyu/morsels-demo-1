When this  absis, therefore, of Mars shall appear in Virgo, who shall expect less  than a strange _catastrophe_ of human affairs in the commonwealth,  monarchy, and kingdom of England? There will then, either in or about  these times, or neer that year, _or within ten years, more or less, of  that time_, appear in this kingdom so strange a revolution of fate,  _so grand a catastrophe_, and great mutation unto this monarchy and  government, as never yet appeared; of which, as the times now stand, I  have no liberty or encouragement to deliver any opinion. _Only, it  will be ominous to London, unto her merchants at sea, to her traffique  at land, to her poor, to her rich, to all sorts of people inhabiting  in her or her liberties, BY REASON OF SUNDRY FIRES AND A CONSUMING  PLAGUE.\"    This is the prediction which, in 1666, led to his being examined by a  Committee of the House of Commons; not, as has been supposed, that he  might \"discover by the stars who were the authors of the Fire of  London,\" but because the precision with which he was thought to have  foretold the event, gave birth to a suspicion that he was already  acquainted with them, and privy to the (supposed) machinations which  had brought about the catastrophe. Curran says, there are two kind of  prophets, those who are really inspired, and those who prophesy events  which they intend themselves to bring about. Upon this occasion, poor  Lilly had the ill-luck to be deemed one of the latter class.           *       *       *       *       *      WHIGS AND TORIES.      Whenever these terms were first introduced, and whatever might be  their original meaning, it is certain that in the reign of Charles the  Second they carried the political signification which they still  retain. Take, as a proof, the following nervous passage from Dryden's  Epilogue to \"The Duke of Guise,\" 1683:        \"Damn'd neuters, in their middle way of steering,    Are neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring:    Nor whigs, nor Tories they; nor this nor that;    Not birds, not beasts, but just a kind of bat:    A twilight animal, true to neither cause,    With _Tory_ wings, but _Whiggish_ teeth and claws.\"           *       *       *       *       *      OTWAY'S \"CAIUS MARIUS.\"      When poor Otway's \"unpardonable piracy,\" in taking part of this play  from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" was reprobated so severely, the critic might  have done him the justice to mention, that, instead of attempting to  pass off the borrowed beauties as his own, he, in the prologue, fully  avowed his obligations. It contains an animated eulogy on Shakspeare,  which thus concludes:--        \"Though much the most unworthy of the throng,    Our this day's poet fears he's done him wrong.    Like greedy beggars, that steal sheaves away,    _You'll find he's rifled him of half a play;_    Among his baser dross you'll see it shine,    Most beautiful, amazing, and divine.\"           *       *       *       *       *      NANCY DAWSON      Was a dancer at Covent Garden Theatre, previous to the accession of  his late majesty; and in 1760 transferred her services to the other  house. On the 23rd of September, in that year, the \"Beggar's Opera\"  was performed at Drury Lane, when the play-bill thus announced her:  \"In Act III, a hornpipe by Miss Dawson, her first appearance  here.\"--It seems she was engaged to oppose Mrs. Vernon in the same  exhibition at the rival house. That her performance of it was somewhat  celebrated, may be inferred from the circumstance of there being a  full-length print of her in it.--_Gentleman's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *    RELIC OF JOHN BUNYAN.      [Illustration: Relic of John Bunyan.]      The cut represents the vessel from which John Bunyan, the author of  that popular allegory, \"the Pilgrim's Progress,\" was accustomed to  drink syllabub, during his incarceration in Bedford County Gaol. The  original is in the possession of the correspondent who has furnished  us with the sketch for the engraver. It is of common earthen-ware,  7-1/2 inches in height, and will contain 3-1/2 pints; one of the  handles is partly broken off; the glaze is of a light flesh tint; and  the vessel is a fair specimen of pottery in the early part of the  seventeenth century.    Bunyan, it will be recollected, was born in 1628, at Elstow, near  Bedford, where the cottage stood in its original state till within  these few years. It has latterly been new fronted, but the interior  remains nearly as in Bunyan's time. He was the son of a tinker, and  followed his father's trade; and at Elstow are the remains of a closet  in which, in early life, he carried on business. During the civil war  he served as a soldier in the parliament army; and subsequently joined  a society of Anabaptists at Bedford, and became their public teacher.  Soon after the Restoration, he was indicted for \"abstaining from  coming to church,\" and holding \"unlawful meetings and conventicles,\"  for which he was sentenced to transportation, which was not executed,  as he was detained in prison upwards of twelve years, and at last  liberated through the charitable interposition of Dr. Barlow, Bishop  of Lincoln.    Sir Richard Phillips, in his recent \"Personal Tour,\" says, \"on  inquiring for relics of honest Bunyan, I was introduced to Mr.  Hilyard, the present amiable and exemplary pastor of the large  Independent Congregation, which 150 years since was under the  spiritual care of Bunyan. Mr. H. at his meeting-house, showed me the  vestry-chair of Bunyan; and the present pulpit is that in which Bunyan  used to preach. At his own house he preserves the records of the  establishment, many pages of which are in a neat and very scholastic  hand by Bunyan, and contain many of his signatures.\"    Bunyan's imprisonment gave rise to \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" a work,  which like \"Robinson Crusoe,\" has remained unrivalled amidst a host of  imitators. He was too, a wit as well as a preacher. Towards the close  of his imprisonment a Quaker called on him, probably to make a convert  of the author of the Pilgrim. He thus addressed him:--\"Friend John, I  am come to thee with a message from the Lord; and after having  searched for thee in half the prisons in England, I am glad that I  have found thee at last.\" \"If the Lord had sent you,\" sarcastically  replied Bunyan, \"you need not have taken so much pains, for the Lord  knows that I have been a prisoner in Bedford Gaol for these twelve  years past.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SKELETON OF AN ELEPHANT.      The bones of poor Chunee, the stupendous elephant shot at Exeter  'Change, in 1826, have, at a considerable expense, been accurately  articulated, and the entire skeleton is now exhibiting in one of the  chambers at \"the Egyptian Hall,\" in Piccadilly. We remember the  interest, the \"sensation,\" which the death of Chunee occasioned: it  was a fertile incident--for we gave an engraving of the enormous  deceased in his den at Exeter 'Change. It is little more than three  years since, and probably in three years more, Chunee will figure in  books of Natural History, and Exeter 'Change in the antiquarian's  portfolio.    We recommend the Naturalist and all such as delight in contemplating  sublime objects of nature, to see this skeleton; and there can  scarcely be an exhibition better calculated to impress the youthful  mind with the vastness of creation. It stands nearly 13 feet high, and  the clear space beneath the ribs is 6 feet.    It would, we think, suit the Zoological Society, and make a fine  _nucleus_ for their Museum.           *       *       *       *       *      ROYAL VISITS TO THE THEATRES.      When the King visited the Opera in 1821, the preparations cost upwards  of L300. The ante-room and the box were hung with satin, and festoons  of gold lace.    When his Majesty visited Covent Garden Theatre in 1823, there were 4,255  persons present, and the receipts were L971. 18_s_. 6_d_.--_Companion to  the Theatres_.           *       *       *       *       *      SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.      EMIGRATION.    _NEW COLONY ON SWAN RIVER_.      We have abridged the following very important and interesting  information respecting the New Settlement on the Western Coast of  Australia, from the last Number of the _Quarterly Review_. The writer  appears to have profited by access to official sources, and thus  enhanced the value of his paper; but, disposed as we are, generally,  to coincide with his views on the subject of _Emigration_, we do not  think it necessary to detail them in this place. We have, however,  retained the \"Regulations,\" as issued from the Colonial Office, and  made occasional quotations from Captain Stirling's Report; besides  availing ourselves of a pamphlet lately published, entitled \"Hints on  Emigration to the New Settlement on the Swan and Canning Rivers.\"[2]  The Report of Mr. Fraser, the government botanical surveyor, from  Sydney, who accompanied Captain Stirling, is not so easy of access.  The _Quarterly_ writer, by some coincident opinions and references,  appears to be acquainted with the above pamphlet, although it is not  mentioned in the review. The official Regulations are as follow:--    1. His majesty's government do not intend to incur any _expense_ in  conveying settlers to the New Colony on the Swan River; and will not  feel bound to defray the expense of supplying them with provisions or  other necessaries, after their arrival there, nor to assist their  removal to England, or elsewhere, should they be desirous of quitting  the Colony.    2.

Then, snorting from the rapid race,    Snuffs the free air a moment's space,    Glares grimly on the baffled chase,      And seeks the covert loan.\"      \"THE COMPLAINT OF THE VIOLETS.        By the silent foot of the shadowy hill      We slept in our green retreats,    And the April showers were wont to fill      Our hearts with sweets;    And though we lay in a lowly bower,      Yet all things loved us well,    And the waking bee left its fairest flower      With us to dwell.    But the warm May came in his pride to woo      The wealth of our virgin store,    And our hearts just felt his breath, and knew      Their sweets no more!    And the summer reigns on the quiet spot      Where we dwell--and its suns and showers    Bring balm to our sisters' hearts, but not--      Oh! not to _ours_!    We live--we bloom--but for ever o'er      Is the charm of the earth and sky:    To our life, ye heavens, that balm restore,      Or bid us die!\"      \"THE FOUNTAIN: A BALLAD.        Why startest thou back from that fount of sweet water?      The roses are drooping while waiting for thee;    'Ladye, 'tis dark with the red hue of slaughter,      There is blood on that fountain--oh! whose may it be?'    Uprose the ladye at once from her dreaming,      Dreams born of sighs from the violets round,    The jasmine bough caught in her bright tresses, seeming      In pity to keep the fair prisoner it bound.    Tear-like the white leaves fell round her, as, breaking      The branch in her haste, to the fountain she flew,    The wave and the flowers o'er its mirror were reeking,      Pale as the marble around it she grew.    She followed its track to the grove of the willow,      To the bower of the twilight it led her at last,    There lay the bosom so often her pillow,      But the dagger was in it, its beating was past.    Round the neck of the youth a light chain was entwining,      The dagger had cleft it, she joined it again.    One dark curl of his, one of her's like gold shining,      'They hoped this would part us, they hoped it in vain.    Race of dark hatred, the stern unforgiving.      Whose hearts are as cold as the steel which they wear.    By the blood of the dead, the despair of the living,      Oh, house of my kinsman, my curse be your share!'    She bowed her fair face on the sleeper before her,      Night came and shed its cold tears on her brow;    Crimson the blush of the morning past o'er her,      But the cheek of the maiden returned not its glow.    Pale on the earth are the wild flowers weeping,      The cypress their column, the night-wind their hymn,    These mark the grave where those lovers are sleeping      Lovely--the lovely are mourning for them.\"    _The Casket._           *       *       *       *       *          THE COSMOPOLITE.           *       *       *       *       *      COUNTRY CHARACTER.    (_For the Mirror_.)      Country society has but little relief; and in proportion to intellectual  refinement, this monotony appears to increase. We have always been  favourable to Book Clubs in country towns, and about ten years since,  established one in the anti-social town of ----. The plan worked well; its  economy was admired, and extensively adopted all over England, but we  heard little of its contributing to the social enjoyments of the people.  Twenty families reading the same books, and these passed from house to  house, among the respectability of the town, might have brought about  a kind of consanguinity of opinion, and led to frequent interchange of  civilities, meetings of the members at each others' houses, or at least  a sort of how-d'ye-do acquaintance. The case was otherwise. The attorney  and the doctor joined our society that their families of ten or twelve  sons and daughters might keep under the sixpences and shillings of the  circulating library; but they soon became jealous of _new books_, although  they often returned them uncut and unread; and so far from knitting the  bonds of acquaintance, we at last thought our plan served to estrange the  members, by affording the little aristocracy frequent opportunities for  venting their splenetic pride; the books were like _disjunctive  conjunctions_, and when we left the place, the \"society\" did not promise  to live another year.    We could entertain ourselves, at least, with sketches of a few of the  members of this disjointed body; but we must be content with one, and that  shall be the _bookseller_ of the town.    Imagine a man of middle height, rather inclined to obesity, and just  turned of fifty-eight. He had a broad, low forehead, sunken eyes, an  aquiline nose, a heavy, hanging lip, and a chin which buried its  projections in ample and unclassical folds of neckerchief. He was bald,  except a tuft on the _occiput_, or hinder part of his head, and on dress  occasions he wore powder. He was a widower, his wife having been dead  about ten years, leaving him two daughters, the amiability of whose  dispositions was a painful contrast to the uneven temper of their father.  He kept a good table, and had the best cellar of grape wine in the town,  but entertained little company. His guests were usually the valets or  butlers of the gentry in the neighbourhood; but the housekeepers were  never invited by his daughters, a point of propriety in male and female  acquaintanceship which amused us not a little. His business was of a most  multifarious description, and besides the trades of bookseller, stationer,  and druggist, he had a printing-office, and was, moreover, a self-taught  printer, He was post-master and stamp sub-distributor, receiver of bail,  and agent for insurances--little official appointments which would have  made him mayor in a corporate town. Of late years, he seldom meddled with  these matters of business; but tired of their common track, he struck out  a course of life, which was neither public nor private, but made him a  sort of oracle in the town, whose opinions were freely printed and  gratuitously circulated, whilst the author was seldom seen except at  vestry-meetings. In this way he acted as secretary to a benevolent society  established by the gentry, and such was his enthusiasm that he gave his  services and L200. worth of printing during the first year; and the  Committee in return presented him with a handsome piece of plate with a  complimentary inscription, which he had the modesty to keep locked up, and  never to display even to his visiters. This proved him to be a benevolent  man, and he would have been ten times more useful had not his charitable  disposition been over tinged with oddity and caprice. His contact with  the poor of the parish soon made him overseer, although his religious  observances would not qualify him for churchwarden; for he only went  to church at funerals, to which he was frequently invited, his staid  appearance, and a certain air of gentility of which he was master, being  in such cases no mean recommendation. Overseer and select vestryman, he  printed the parish accounts, for the most part gratuitously, although the  poor and even the better portion of the towns-people never gave him full  credit for this generosity, conceiving that he was repaid by some secret  services or funds. The oddity of his pursuits was only exceeded by their  variety. In politics he was a disciple of Cobbett, and year after year,  foretold a revolution, an alarm which he communicated to every one of his  household. He took extreme interest in all new mechanical projects, but  seldom indulged in the practical part of them. In wine-making he was once  a very experimentalist, and studied every line of Macculloch and unripe  fruit; next, he turned over every inch of his garden, analyzed the soil  _a la_ Davy, and _salted_ all his growing crops. His cogitative habits led  him to take long walks in the country, and he soon flew from horticultural  chemistry to real farming; and about the same time took to road making and  macadamization, and became a surveyor of the highways. But the trustees  wanting to macadamize the miserably pitched street of the town, he  bethought him of dust in summer and mud in winter, and drew up a long  memorial to the lords of the soil, remonstrating with them on their  impolitic conduct; but all in vain. It is curious, however, to reflect  that what the people of a country town about ten years ago thought a curse  to their roads should now be adopted in many of the principal London  Streets. The last we heard of our bookseller's hobbies, was that he had  bought the lease of a house for the sake of the large garden attached to  it, and here, like Evelyn in his _Elysium Britannicum_, he passes his days  in the primitive occupation of gardening.    Our bookseller is a self-educated man, and in some pamphlets on the  charitable institution to which we have alluded, are many of the errors  of style peculiar to self-educated writers. Among his acquaintance we  remember an attorney who practised in London, but had a small house in  the town. He had been editor and proprietor of four or five morning and  evening newspapers, and furnished our bookseller with all the news off  'Change and about town. This friend and the journals were his oracles, and  their influence he digested in morsels of political economy, so introduced  into his pamphlets as not to offend the landed gentry of the neighbourhood.  To them, it should be mentioned, he was a most useful personage, and his  aid and auspices, were almost necessary to the success of any project for  the interest of the town. The trades-people looked up to him; they would  agree if Mr. ---- did, or they would wait his opinion.    We have heard that he has been a gallant in his time; and more than once  he has told little stories of dances and harvest homes, and merry meetings  at the wealthy farmers' in the neighbourhood, of the moonlight walk home,  and of his companions counting their won guineas"]]]
