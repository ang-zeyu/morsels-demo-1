Laurence, the dangers of priuie rockes and  quicksands, the running seas, and the perils thereof, with the certaine and  vndoubted signes of land. All these and other particularities are plainly  and truely here deliuered by one Thomas Steuens a learned Englishman, who  in the yeere 1579 going as a passenger in the Portugale Fleete from Lisbon  into India, wrote the same from Goa to his father in England: Whereunto I  haue added the memorable voyage of M. Iames Lancaster, who doth not onely  recount and confirme most of the things aboue mentioned, but also doth  acquaint vs with the state of the voyage beyond Cape Comori, and the Isle  of Ceilon, with the Isles of Nicubar and Gomes Polo lying within two  leagues of the rich Island Sumatra, and those of Pulo Pinaom, with the  maine land of Iunçalaon and the streight of Malacca. I haue likewise added  a late intercepted letter of a Portugall reuealing the secret and most  gainefull trade of Pegu, which is also confirmed by Cesar Fredericke a  Venetian, and M. Ralph Fitch now liuing here in London.    And because our chiefe desire is to find out ample vent of our wollen  cloth, the naturall commoditie of this our Realme, the fittest places,  which in al my readings and obseruations I find for that purpose, are the  manifold Islands of Iapan, and the Northern parts of China, and the regions  of the Tartars next adioyning (whereof I read, that the countrey in winter  is Assi fria como Flandes, that is to say, as cold as Flanders, and that  the riuers be strongly ouer frozen) and therefore I haue here inserted two  speciall Treatises of the sayd Countries, the last discourse I hold to be  the most exact of those parts that is yet come to light, which was printed  in Lantine in Macao a citie of China, in China paper, in the yeere a  thousand fiue hundred and ninetie, and was intercepted in the great Carack  called Madre de Dios two yeeres after, inclosed in a case of sweete Cedar  wood, and lapped vp almost an hundred fold in fine Calicut cloth, as though  it had bene some incomparable iewel.    But leauing abruptly this discourse, I thinke it not impertinent, before I  make an end, to deliuer some of the reasons, that moued me to present this  part of my trauailes vnto your Honour. The reuerend antiquitie in the  dedication of their workes made choyse of such patrons, as eyther with  their reputation and credits were able to countenance the same, or by their  wisedome and vnderstanding were able to censure and approue them, or with  their abilitie were likely to stand them or theirs in steade in the  ordinarie necessities and accidents of their life. Touching the first, your  descent from a father, that was accounted Pater patriæ, your owne place and  credite in execution of her Maiesties inward counsailes and publike  seruices, added to your well discharging your forren imployment (when the  greatest cause in Christendome was handled) haue not onely drawen mens eyes  vpon you, but also forcibly haue moued many, and my selfe among the rest to  haue our labours protected by your authoritie. For the second point, when  it pleased your Honour in sommer was two yeeres to haue some conference  with me, and to demaund mine opinion touching the state of the Country of  Guiana, and whether it were fit to be planted by the English: I then (to my  no small ioy) did admire the exact knowledge which you had gotten of those  matters of Indian Nauigations: and how carefull you were, not to be  ouertaken with any partiall affection to the Action, appeared also, by the  sound arguments which you made pro and contra, of the likelihood and reason  of good or ill successe of the same, before the State and common wealth  (wherein you haue an extraordinarie voyce) should be farther engaged. In  consideration whereof I thinke myselfe thrise happie to haue these my  trauailes censured by your Honours so well approued iudgement, Touching the  third and last motiue I cannot but acknowledge my selfe much indebted for  your fauourable letters heretofore written in my behalfe in mine, honest  causes. Whereunto I may adde, that when this worke was to passe vnto the  presse, your Honour did not onely intreate a worthy knight, a person of  speciall experience, as in many others so in marine causes, to ouersee and  peruse the same, but also vpon his good report with your most fauourable  letters did warrant, and with extraordinarie commendation did approue and  allow my labours, and desire to publish the same. Wherefore to conclude,  seeing they take their life and light from the most cheerefull and benigne  aspect of your fauour, I thinke it my bounden dutie in all humilitie and  with much bashfulnesse to recommend my selfe and them vnto your right  Honorable and fauourable protection, and your Honour to the merciful  tuition of the most High.

The voyage of Macham an English man, wherein he first of any man discouered    the Iland of Madera, recorded verbatim in the Portugall history, written    by Antonio Galuano.    [Sidenote: Madera first discouered by one Macham an Englishman.] In the  yeere 1344, King Peter the fourth of that name reigning in Aragon, the  Chronicles of his age write that about this time the Iland of Madera,  standing in 32 degrees, was discouered by an English man, which was named  Macham, who sailing out of England into Spaine, with a woman that he had  stollen, arriued by tempest in that Iland, and did cast anker in that hauen  or bay, which now is called Machico after the name of Macham. And because  his louer was sea sicke, he went on land with some of his company, and the  shippe with a good winde made saile away, and the woman died for thought.  [Sidenote: Macham made there a chapel, naming it Iesus chapell.] Macham,  which loued her dearely built a chapell, or hermitage, to bury her in,  calling it by the name of Iesus, and caused his name and hers to be written  or grauen vpon the stone of her tombe, and the occasion of their arriuall  there. And afterward he ordeined a boat made of one tree (for there be  trees of a great compasse about) and went to sea in it, with those men that  he had, and were left behinde with him, and came vpon the coast of Afrike,  without saile or oare. And the Moores which saw it tooke it to be a  maruellous thing, and presented him vnto the king of that countrey for a  woonder, and that king also sent him and his companions for a miracle vnto  the king of Castile.    In the yeere 1395. King Henry the third of that name reigning in Castile,  the information which Macham gaue of this Iland, and also the ship of his  company, mooued many of France and Castile to go and discouer it, and also  the great Canaria, &c.    In the yeere 1417, King Iohn the second reigning in Castile, and his mother  Lady Katherine being Regent, one Monsieur Ruben of Bracamont, which was  Admirall of France, demanding the conquest of the Ilands of the Canaries,  with the title of King, for a kinsman of his named Monsieur Iohn  Betancourt, after that the Queene hath giuen him them, and holpen him, he  departed from Siuil with a good army. And they affirme also, that the  principall cause which moued him to this, was to discouer the Iland of  Madera, which Macham had found, &c. ibidem pag. 2. of Anthonio Galuano.  [Footnote: The romantic story of Machin or Macham has been recently  confirmed by authentic documents discovered in Lisbon. The lady eloped with  him from near Bristol. The name of Madeira is derived from its thick woods,  the word being the same as the Latin Materies.]           *       *       *       *       *    A briefe note concerning an ancient trade of the English Marchants to the    Canarie-ilands, gathered out of an olde ligier booke of M.

In a previous work I have considered the organization of the  American aborigines in gentes, phratries, and tribes, with the  functions of each in their social system. From the importance of  this organization to a right understanding of their social and  governmental life, a recapitulation of the principal features of  each member of the organic series is necessary in this connection.  [Footnote: \"Ancient Society\" or \"Researches in the Lines of Human  Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization.\" Henry  Holt & Co. 1877.]    The gentile organization opens to us one of the oldest and most  widely-prevalent institutions of mankind. It furnished the nearly  universal plan of government of ancient society, Asiatic, European,  African, American, and Australian. It was the instrumentality by  means of which society was organized and held together. Commencing  in savagery, and continuing through the three subperiods of barbarism,  it remained until the establishment of political society, which did  not occur until after civilization had Commenced. The Grecian gens,  phratry, and tribe, the Roman gens, curia, and tribe find their  analogues in the gens, phratry, and tribe of the American aborigines.  In like manner the Irish sept, the Scottish clan, the phratra of the  Albanians, and the Sanskrit ganas, without extending the comparison  further, are the same as the American Indian gens, which has usually  been called a clan. As far as our knowledge extends, this  organization runs through the entire ancient world upon all the  continents, and it was brought down to the historical period by such  tribes as attained to civilization. Nor is this all. Gentile society  wherever found is the same in structural organization and in  principles of action; but changing from lower to higher forms with  the progressive advancement of the people. These changes give the  history of development of the same original conceptions.        THE GENS.    Gens, [Greek: genos], and gattas in Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit have  alike the primary signification of kin. They contain the same  element as gigno, [Greek: gignouas], and ganaman, in the same  languages, signifying to beget; thus implying in each an immediate  common descent of the members of a gens. A gens, therefore, is a  body of consanguinei descended from the same common ancestor,  distinguished by a gentile name, and bound together by affinities of  blood. It includes a moiety only of such descendants. Where descent  is in the female line, as it was universally in the archaic period,  the gens is composed of a supposed female ancestor and her children,  together with the children of her female descendants, through females,  in perpetuity; and where descent is in the male line--into which it  was changed after the appearance of property in masses--of a  supposed male ancestor and his children, together with the children  of his male descendants, through males, in perpetuity. The family  name among ourselves is a survival of the gentile name, with descent  in the male line, and passing in the same manner. The modern family,  as expressed by its name, is an unorganized gens, with the bond of  kin broken, and its members as widely dispersed as the family name  is found.    Among the nations named, the gens indicated a social organization of  a remarkable character, which had prevailed from an antiquity so  remote that its origin was lost in the obscurity of far distant ages.  It was also the unit of organization of a social and governmental  system, the fundamental basis of ancient society. This organization  was not confined to the Latin, Grecian, and Sanskrit speaking tribes,  with whom it became such a conspicuous institution. It has been  found in other branches of the Aryan family of nations, in the  Semitic, Uralian and Turanian families, among the tribes of Africa  and Australia, and of the American aborigines.    The gens has passed through successive stages of development in its  transition from its archaic to its final form with the progress of  mankind. These changes were limited in the main to two, firstly,  changing descent from the female line, which was the archaic rule,  as among the Iroquois, to the male line, which was the final rule,  as among the Grecian and Roman gentes; and, secondly, changing the  inheritance of the property of a deceased member of the gens from  his gentiles, who took it in the archaic period, first to his  agnatic kindred, and finally to his children. These changes, slight  as they may seem, indicate very great changes of condition as well  as a large degree of progressive development.    The gentile organization, originating in the period of savagery,  enduring through the three subperiods of barbarism, finally gave way,  among the more advanced tribes, when they attained civilization--the  requirements of which it was unable to meet. Among the Greeks and  Romans political society supervened upon gentile society, but not  until civilization had commenced. The township (and its equivalent,  the city ward), with its fixed property, and the inhabitants it  contained, organized as a body politic, became the unit and the  basis of a new and radically different system of government. After  political society was instituted this ancient and time-honored  organization, with the phratry and tribe developed from it,  gradually yielded up their existence. It was under gentile  institutions that barbarism was won by some of the tribes of mankind  while in savagery, and that civilization was won by the descendants  of some of the same tribes while in barbarism. Gentile institutions  carried a portion of mankind from savagery to civilization.    This organization may be successfully studied both in its living and  in its historical forms in a large number of tribes and races. In  such an investigation it is preferable to commence with the gens in  its archaic form I shall commence, therefore, with the gens as it  now exists among the American aborigines, where it is found in its  archaic form, and among whom its theoretical constitution and  practical workings can be investigated more successfully than in the  historical gentes of the Greeks and Romans. In fact, to understand  fully the gentes of the latter nations a knowledge of the functions  and of the rights, privileges, and obligations of the members of the  American Indian gens is imperatively necessary.    In American ethnography tribe and clan have been used in the place  of gens as equivalent terms from not perceiving the universality of  the latter. In previous works, and following my predecessors, I have  so used them. A comparison of the Indian clan with the gens of the  Greeks and Romans reveals at once their identity in structure and  functions. It also extends to the phratry and tribe. If the identity  of these several organizations can be shown, of which there can be  no doubt, there is a manifest propriety in returning to the Latin  and Grecian terminologies, which are full and precise as well as  historical.    The plan of government of the American aborigines commenced with the  gens and ended with the confederacy, the latter being the highest  point to which their governmental institutions attained. It gave for  the organic series: first, the gens, a body of consanguinei having a  common gentile name; second, the phratry, an assemblage of related  gentes united in a higher association for certain common objects;  third, the tribe, an assemblage of gentes, usually organized in  phratries, all the members of which spoke the same dialect; and  fourth, a confederacy of tribes, the members of which respectively  spoke dialects of the same stock language. It resulted in a gentile  society (societas) as distinguished from a political society or  state (civitas). The difference between the two is wide and  fundamental. There was neither a political society, nor a citizen,  nor a state, nor any civilization in America when it was discovered.  One entire ethnical period intervened between the highest American  Indian tribes and the beginning of civilization, as that term is  properly understood.    The gens, though a very ancient social organization founded upon kin,  does not include all the descendants of a common ancestor. It was  for the reason that when the gens came in marriage between single  pairs was unknown, and descent through males could not be traced  with certainty. Kindred were linked together chiefly through the  bond of their maternity In the ancient gens descent was limited to  the female line. It embraced all such persons as traced their  descent from a supposed common female ancestor, through females, the  evidence of the fact being the possession of a common gentile name.  It would include this ancestor and her children, the children of her  daughters, and the children of her female descendants, through  females, in perpetuity, while the children of her sons and the  children of her male descendants, through males, would belong to  other gentes, namely, those of their respective mothers. Such was  the gens in its archaic form, when the paternity of children was not  certainly ascertainable, and when their maternity afforded the only  certain criterion of descents.    This state of descents which can be traced back to the Middle Status  of savagery, as among the Australians, remained among the American  aborigines through the Upper Status of savagery, and into and  through the Lower Status of barbarism, with occasional exceptions.  In the Middle Status of barbarism the Indian tribes began to change  descent from the female line to the male, as die syndyasmian family  of the period began to assume monogamian characteristics.
