IN DEFENSE OF ASTIGMATISM      This is peculiarly an age where novelists pride themselves on the  breadth of their outlook and the courage with which they refuse to  ignore the realities of life; and never before have authors had such  scope in the matter of the selection of heroes. In the days of the  old-fashioned novel, when the hero was automatically Lord Blank or Sir  Ralph Asterisk, there were, of course, certain rules that had to be  observed, but today--why, you can hardly hear yourself think for the  uproar of earnest young novelists proclaiming how free and unfettered  they are. And yet, no writer has had the pluck to make his hero wear  glasses.    In the old days, as I say, this was all very well. The hero was a  young lordling, sprung from a line of ancestors who had never done  anything with their eyes except wear a piercing glance before which  lesser men quailed. But now novelists go into every class of society  for their heroes, and surely, at least an occasional one of them must  have been astigmatic. Kipps undoubtedly wore glasses; so did Bunker  Bean; so did Mr. Polly, Clayhanger, Bibbs, Sheridan, and a score of  others. Then why not say so?    Novelists are moving with the times in every other direction. Why not  in this?    It is futile to advance the argument that glasses are unromantic. They  are not. I know, because I wear them myself, and I am a singularly  romantic figure, whether in my rimless, my Oxford gold-bordered, or  the plain gent's spectacles which I wear in the privacy of my study.    Besides, everybody wears glasses nowadays. That is the point I wish to  make. For commercial reasons, if for no others, authors ought to think  seriously of this matter of goggling their heroes. It is an admitted  fact that the reader of a novel likes to put himself in the hero's  place--to imagine, while reading, that he is the hero. What an  audience the writer of the first romance to star a spectacled hero  will have. All over the country thousands of short-sighted men will  polish their glasses and plunge into his pages. It is absurd to go on  writing in these days for a normal-sighted public. The growing  tenseness of life, with its small print, its newspapers read by  artificial light, and its flickering motion pictures, is whittling  down the section of the populace which has perfect sight to a mere  handful.    I seem to see that romance. In fact, I think I shall write it myself.  \"'Evadne,' murmured Clarence, removing his pince-nez and polishing  them tenderly....'\" \"'See,' cried Clarence, 'how clearly every leaf of  yonder tree is mirrored in the still water of the lake. I can't see  myself, unfortunately, for I have left my glasses on the parlor piano,  but don't worry about me: go ahead and see!\" ... \"Clarence adjusted his  tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles with a careless gesture, and faced the  assassins without a tremor.\" Hot stuff? Got the punch? I should say  so. Do you imagine that there will be a single man in this country  with the price of the book in his pocket and a pair of pince-nez on  his face who will not scream and kick like an angry child if you  withhold my novel from him?    And just pause for a moment to think of the serial and dramatic rights  of the story. All editors wear glasses, so do all theatrical managers.  My appeal will be irresistible. All I shall have to do will be to see  that the check is for the right figure and to supervise the placing of  the electric sign        SPECTACLES OF FATE        BY P. G. WODEHOUSE    over the doors of whichever theatre I happen to select for the  production of the play.    Have you ever considered the latent possibilities for dramatic  situations in short sight? You know how your glasses cloud over when  you come into a warm room out of the cold? Well, imagine your hero in  such a position. He has been waiting outside the murderer's den  preparatory to dashing in and saving the heroine. He dashes in. \"Hands  up, you scoundrels,\" he cries. And then his glasses get all misty, and  there he is, temporarily blind, with a full-size desperado backing  away and measuring the distance in order to hand him one with a  pickaxe.    Or would you prefer something less sensational, something more in the  romantic line? Very well. Hero, on his way to the Dowager Duchess's  ball, slips on a banana-peel and smashes his only pair of spectacles.  He dare not fail to attend the ball, for the dear Duchess would never  forgive him; so he goes in and proposes to a girl he particularly  dislikes because she is dressed in pink, and the heroine told him that  she was going to wear pink. But the heroine's pink dress was late in  coming home from the modiste's and she had to turn up in blue. The  heroine comes in just as the other girl is accepting him, and there  you have a nice, live, peppy, kick-off for your tale of passion and  human interest.    But I have said enough to show that the time has come when novelists,  if they do not wish to be left behind in the race, must adapt  themselves to modern conditions. One does not wish to threaten, but,  as I say, we astigmatics are in a large minority and can, if we get  together, make our presence felt. Roused by this article to a sense of  the injustice of their treatment, the great army of glass-wearing  citizens could very easily make novelists see reason. A boycott of  non-spectacled heroes would soon achieve the necessary reform. Perhaps  there will be no need to let matters go as far as that. I hope not.  But, if this warning should be neglected, if we have any more of these  novels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or  cheerful blue eyes--any sort of eyes, in fact, lacking some muscular  affliction, we shall know what to do.          PHOTOGRAPHERS AND ME      I look in my glass, dear reader, and what do I see? Nothing so  frightfully hot, believe me. The face is slablike, the ears are large  and fastened on at right-angles. Above the eyebrows comes a stagnant  sea of bald forehead, stretching away into the distance with nothing  to relieve it but a few wisps of lonely hair. The nose is blobby, the  eyes dull, like those of a fish not in the best of health. A face, in  short, taking it for all in all, which should be reserved for the gaze  of my nearest and dearest who, through long habit, have got used to it  and can see through to the pure white soul beneath. At any rate, a  face not to be scattered about at random and come upon suddenly by  nervous people and invalids.    And yet, just because I am an author, I have to keep on being  photographed. It is the fault of publishers and editors, of course,  really, but it is the photographer who comes in for the author's hate.    Something has got to be done about this practice of publishing  authors' photographs. We have to submit to it, because editors and  publishers insist. They have an extraordinary superstition that it  helps an author's sales. The idea is that the public sees the  photograph, pauses spell-bound for an instant, and then with a cry of  ecstasy rushes off to the book-shop and buys copy after copy of the  gargoyle's latest novel.    Of course, in practice, it works out just the other way. People read a  review of an author's book and are told that it throbs with a passion  so intense as almost to be painful, and are on the point of digging  seven-and-sixpence out of their child's money-box to secure a copy,  when their eyes fall on the man's photograph at the side of the  review, and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears  spectacles and a low collar. And this man is the man who is said to  have laid bare the soul of a woman as with a scalpel.    Naturally their faith is shaken. They feel that a man like that cannot  possibly know anything about Woman or any other subject except where  to go for a vegetarian lunch, and the next moment they have put down  the hair-pin and the child is seven-and-six in hand and the author his  ten per cent., or whatever it is, to the bad. And all because of a  photograph.    For the ordinary man, the recent introduction of high-art methods into  photography has done much to diminish the unpleasantness of the  operation. In the old days of crude and direct posing, there was no  escape for the sitter. He had to stand up, backed by a rustic stile  and a flabby canvas sheet covered with exotic trees, glaring straight  into the camera. To prevent any eleventh-hour retreat, a sort of spiky  thing was shoved firmly into the back of his head leaving him with the  choice of being taken as he stood or having an inch of steel jabbed  into his skull. Modern methods have changed all that.    There are no photographs nowadays. Only \"camera portraits\" and \"lens  impressions.\" The full face has been abolished. The ideal of the  present-day photographer is to eliminate the sitter as far as possible  and concentrate on a general cloudy effect. I have in my possession  two studies of my Uncle Theodore--one taken in the early 'nineties,  the other in the present year. The first shows him, evidently in pain,  staring before him with a fixed expression. In his right hand he  grasps a scroll. His left rests on a moss-covered wall. Two sea-gulls  are flying against a stormy sky.    As a likeness, it is almost brutally exact. My uncle stands forever  condemned as the wearer of a made-up tie.    The second is different in every respect. Not only has the sitter been  taken in the popular modern \"one-twentieth face,\" showing only the  back of the head, the left ear and what is either a pimple or a flaw  in the print, but the whole thing is plunged in the deepest shadow. It  is as if my uncle had been surprised by the camera while chasing a  black cat in his coal-cellar on a moonlight night. There is no  question as to which of the two makes the more attractive picture. My  family resemble me in that respect.

The editor of an Eastern health magazine, having asked for information  relative to the habits, hours of work, and style and frequency of feed  adopted by literary men, and several parties having responded who were no  more essentially saturated with literature than I am, I now take my pen in  hand to reveal the true inwardness of my literary life, so that boys, who  may yearn to follow in my footsteps and wear a laurel wreath the year round  in place of a hat, may know what the personal habits of a literary party  are.    I rise from bed the first thing in the morning, leaving my couch not  because I am dissatisfied with it, but because I cannot carry it with me  during the day.    I then seat myself on the edge of the bed and devote a few moments to  thought. Literary men who have never set aside a few moments on rising for  thought will do well to try it.    I then insert myself into a pair of middle-aged pantaloons. It is needless  to say that girls who may have a literary tendency will find little to  interest them here.    Other clothing is added to the above from time to time. I then bathe  myself. Still this is not absolutely essential to a literary life. Others  who do not do so have been equally successful.    Some literary people bathe before dressing.    I then go down stairs and out to the barn, where I feed the horse. Some  literary men feel above taking care of a horse, because there is really  nothing in common between the care of a horse and literature, but  simplicity is my watchword. T. Jefferson would have to rise early in the  day to eclipse me in simplicity. I wish I had as many dollars as I have  got simplicity.    I then go in to breakfast. This meal consists almost wholly of food. I am  passionately fond of food, and I may truly say, with my hand on my heart,  that I owe much of my great success in life to this inward craving, this  constant yearning for something better.    During this meal I frequently converse with my family. I do not feel above  my family, at least, if I do, I try to conceal it as much as possible.  Buckwheat pancakes in a heated state, with maple syrup on the upper side,  are extremely conducive to literature. Nothing jerks the mental faculties  around with greater rapidity than buckwheat pancakes.    After breakfast the time is put in to good advantage looking forward to  the time when dinner will be ready. From 8 to 10 A. M., however, I  frequently retire to my private library hot-bed in the hay mow, and write  1,200 words in my forthcoming book, the price of which will be $2.50 in  cloth and $4 with Russia back.    I then play Copenhagen with some little girls 21 years of age, who live  near by, and of whom I am passionately fond.    After that I dig some worms, with a view to angling. I then angle. After  this I return home, waiting until dusk, however, as I do not like to  attract attention. Nothing is more distasteful to a truly good man of  wonderful literary acquirements, and yet with singular modesty, than the  coarse and rude scrutiny of the vulgar herd.    In winter I do not angle. I read the \"Pirate Prince\" or the \"Missourian's  Mash,\" or some other work, not so much for the plot as the style, that I  may get my mind into correct channels of thought I then play \"old sledge\"  in a rambling sort of manner. I sometimes spend an evening at home, in  order to excite remark and draw attention to my wonderful eccentricity.    I do not use alcohol in any form, if I know it, though sometimes I am  basely deceived by those who know of my peculiar prejudice, and who do it,  too, because they enjoy watching my odd and amusing antics at the time.    Alcohol should be avoided entirely by literary workers, especially young  women. There can be no more pitiable sight to the tender hearted, than a  young woman of marked ability writing an obituary poem while under the  influence of liquor.    I knew a young man who was a good writer. His penmanship was very good,  indeed. He once wrote an article for the press while under the influence  of liquor. He sent it to the editor, who returned it at once with a cold  and cruel letter, every line of which was a stab. The letter came at a  time when he was full of remorse.    He tossed up a cent to see whether he should blow out his brains or go  into the ready-made clothing business. The coin decided that he should die  by his own hand, but his head ached so that he didn't feel like shooting  into it. So he went into the ready-made clothing business, and now he pays  taxes on $75,000, so he is probably worth $150,000. This, of course,  salves over his wounded heart, but he often says to me that he might have  been in the literary business to-day if he had let liquor alone.          A Father's Letter.    My dear son.--Your letter of last week reached us yesterday, and I enclose  $13, which is all I have by me at the present time. I may sell the other  shote next week and make up the balance of what you wanted. I will  probably have to wear the old buffalo overcoat to meetings again this  winter, but that don't matter so long as you are getting an education.    I hope you will get your education as cheap as you can, for it cramps your  mother and me like Sam Hill to put up the money. Mind you, I don't  complain. I knew education come high, but I didn't know the clothes cost  so like sixty.    I want you to be so that you can go anywhere and spell the hardest word. I  want you to be able to go among the Romans or the Medes and Persians and  talk to any of them in their own native tongue.    I never had any advantages when I was a boy, but your mother and I decided  that we would sock you full of knowledge, if your liver held out,  regardless of expense. We calculate to do it, only we want you to go as  slow on swallowtail coats as possible till we can sell our hay.    Now, regarding that boat-paddling suit, and that baseball suit, and that  bathing suit, and that roller-rinktum suit, and that lawn-tennis suit,  mind, I don't care about the expense, because you say a young man can't  really educate himself thoroughly without them, but I wish you'd send home  what you get through with this fall, and I'll wear them through the winter  under my other clothes. We have a good deal severer winters here than we  used to, or else I'm failing in bodily health. Last winter I tried to go  through without underclothes, the way I did when I was a boy, but a  Manitoba wave came down our way and picked me out of a crowd with its eyes  shet.    In your last letter you alluded to getting injured in a little \"hazing  scuffle with a pelican from the rural districts.\" I don't want any harm to  come to you, my son, but if I went from the rural districts and another  young gosling from the rural districts undertook to haze me, I would meet  him when the sun goes down, and I would swat him across the back of the  neck with a fence board, and then I would meander across the pit of his  stomach and put a blue forget-me-not under his eye.    Your father aint much on Grecian mythology and how to get the square root  of a barrel of pork, but he wouldn't allow any educational institutions to  haze him with impunity. Perhaps you remember once when you tried to haze  your father a little, just to kill time, and how long it took you to  recover. Anybody that goes at it right can have a good deal of fun with  your father, but those who have sought to monkey with him, just to break  up the monotony of life, have most always succeeded in finding what they  sought.    [Illustration: RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE.]    I ain't much of a pensman, so you will have to excuse this letter. We are  all quite well, except old Fan, who has a galded shoulder, and hope this  will find you enjoying the same great blessing.    Your Father.          Archimedes.    Archimedes, whose given name has been accidentally torn off and swallowed  up in oblivion, was born in Syracuse, 2,171 years ago last spring. He was  a philosopher and mathematical expert. During his life he was never  successfully stumped in figures. It ill befits me now, standing by his  new-made grave, to say aught of him that is not of praise. We can only  mourn his untimely death, and wonder which of our little band of great men  will be the next to go.    Archimedes was the first to originate and use the word \"Eureka.\" It has  been successfully used very much lately, and as a result we have the  Eureka baking powder, the Eureka suspender, the Eureka bed-bug buster, the  Eureka shirt, and the Eureka stomach bitters. Little did Archimedes wot,  when he invented this term, that it would come into such general use.    Its origin has been explained before, but it would not be out of place  here for me to tell it as I call it to mind now, looking back over  Archie's eventful life.    King Hiero had ordered an eighteen karat crown, size 7-1/8, and, after  receiving it from the hands of the jeweler, suspected that it had been  adulterated. He therefore applied to Archimedes to ascertain, if possible,  whether such was the case or not. Archimedes had just got in on No. 3, two  hours late, and covered with dust. He at once started for a hot and cold  bath emporium on Sixteenth street, meantime wondering how the dickens he  would settle that crown business.    He filled the bath-tub level full, and, piling up his raiment on the  floor, jumped in. Displacing a large quantity of water, equal to his own  bulk, he thereupon solved the question of specific gravity, and,  forgetting his bill, forgetting his clothes, he sailed up Sixteenth street  and all over Syracuse, clothed in shimmering sunlight and a plain gold  ring, shouting \"Eureka!\" He ran head-first into a Syracuse policeman and  howled \"Eureka!\" The policeman said: \"You'll have to excuse me; I don't  know him.\" He scattered the Syracuse Normal school on its way home, and  tried to board a Fifteenth"]]]
