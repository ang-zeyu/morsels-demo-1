It is the tendency of Bulgarian  historians, who scornfully point to the fact that the history of Russia  only dates from the ninth century, to exaggerate the antiquity of their  own and to claim as early a date as possible for the authentic appearance  of their ancestors on the kaleidoscopic stage of the Balkan theatre. They  are also unwilling to admit that they were anticipated by the Slavs; they  prefer to think that the Slavs only insinuated themselves there thanks to  the energy of the Bulgars' offensive against the Greeks, and that as soon  as the Bulgars had leisure to look about them they found all the best  places already occupied by the anarchic Slavs.    Of course it is very difficult to say positively whether Bulgars were or  were not present in the welter of Asiatic nations which swept westwards  into Europe with little intermission throughout the fifth and sixth  centuries, but even if they were, they do not seem to have settled down as  early as that anywhere south of the Danube; it seems certain that they did  not do so until the seventh century, and therefore that the Slavs were  definitely installed in the Balkan peninsula a whole century before the  Bulgars crossed the Danube for good.    The Bulgars, like the Huns and the Avars who preceded them, and like the  Magyars and the Turks who followed them, were a tribe from eastern Asia,  of the stock known as Mongol or Tartar. The tendency of all these peoples  was to move westwards from Asia into Europe, and this they did at  considerable and irregular intervals, though in alarming and apparently  inexhaustible numbers, roughly from the fourth till the fourteenth  centuries. The distance was great, but the journey, thanks to the flat,  grassy, treeless, and well-watered character of the steppes of southern  Russia which they had to cross, was easy. They often halted for  considerable periods by the way, and some never moved further westwards  than Russia. Thus at one time the Bulgars settled in large numbers on the  Volga, near its confluence with the Kama, and it is presumed that they  were well established there in the fifth century. They formed a community  of considerable strength and importance, known as Great or White Bulgaria.  These Bulgars fused with later Tartar immigrants from Asia and eventually  were consolidated into the powerful kingdom of Kazan, which was only  crushed by the Tsar Ivan IV in 1552. According to Bulgarian historians,  the basins of the rivers Volga and Don and the steppes of eastern Russia  proved too confined a space for the legitimate development of Bulgarian  energy, and expansion to the west was decided on. A large number of  Bulgars therefore detached themselves and began to move south-westwards.  During the sixth century they seem to have been settled in the country to  the north of the Black Sea, forming a colony known as Black Bulgaria. It  is very doubtful whether the Bulgars did take part, as they are supposed  to have done, in the ambitious but unsuccessful attack on Constantinople  in 559 under Zabergan, chief of another Tartar tribe; but it is fairly  certain that they did in the equally formidable but equally unsuccessful  attacks by the Slavs and Avars against Salonika in 609 and Constantinople  in 626.    During the last quarter of the sixth and the first of the seventh century  the various branches of the Bulgar nation, stretching from the Volga to  the Danube, were consolidated and kept in control by their prince Kubrat,  who eventually fought on behalf of the Greeks against the Avars, and was  actually baptized in Constantinople. The power of the Bulgars grew as that  of the Avars declined, but at the death of Kubrat, in 638, his realm was  divided amongst his sons. One of these established himself in Pannonia,  where he joined forces with what was left of the Avars, and there the  Bulgars maintained themselves till they were obliterated by the irruption  of the Magyars in 893. Another son, Asparukh, or Isperikh, settled in  Bessarabia, between the rivers Prut and Dniester, in 640, and some years  later passed southwards. After desultory warfare with Constantinople, from  660 onwards, his successor finally overcame the Greeks, who were at that  time at war with the Arabs, captured Varna, and definitely established  himself between the Danube and the Balkan range in the year 679. From that  year the Danube ceased to be the frontier of the eastern empire.    The numbers of the Bulgars who settled south of the Danube are not known,  but what happened to them is notorious. The well-known process, by which  the Franks in Gaul were absorbed by the far more numerous indigenous  population which they had conquered, was repeated, and the Bulgars became  fused with the Slavs. So complete was the fusion, and so preponderating  the influence of the subject nationality, that beyond a few personal names  no traces of the language of the Bulgars have survived. Modern Bulgarian,  except for the Turkish words introduced into it later during the Ottoman  rule, is purely Slavonic. Not so the Bulgarian nationality; as is so often  the case with mongrel products, this race, compared with the Serbs, who  are purely Slav, has shown considerably greater virility, cohesion, and  driving-power, though it must be conceded that its problems have been  infinitely simpler.        5    _The Early Years of Bulgaria and the Introduction of Christianity_,  700-893      From the time of their establishment in the country to which they have  given their name the Bulgars became a thorn in the side of the Greeks, and  ever since both peoples have looked on one another as natural and  hereditary enemies. The Bulgars, like all the barbarians who had preceded  them, were fascinated by the honey-pot of Constantinople, and, though they  never succeeded in taking it, they never grew tired of making the attempt.    For two hundred years after the death of Asparukh, in 661, the Bulgars  were perpetually fighting either against the Greeks or else amongst  themselves. At times a diversion was caused by the Bulgars taking the part  of the Greeks, as in 718, when they 'delivered' Constantinople, at the  invocation of the Emperor Leo, from the Arabs, who were besieging it. From  about this time the Bulgarian monarchy, which had been hereditary, became  elective, and the anarchy of the many, which the Bulgars found when they  arrived, and which their first few autocratic rulers had been able to  control, was replaced by an anarchy of the few. Prince succeeded prince,  war followed war, at the will of the feudal nobles. This internal strife  was naturally profitable to the Greeks, who lavishly subsidized the rival  factions.    At the end of the eighth century the Bulgars south of the Danube joined  forces with those to the north in the efforts of the latter against the  Avars, who, beaten by Charlemagne, were again pressing south-eastwards  towards the Danube. In this the Bulgars were completely successful under  the leadership of one Krum, whom, in the elation of victory, they promptly  elected to the throne. Krum was a far more capable ruler than they had  bargained for, and he not only united all the Bulgars north and south of  the Danube into one dominion, but also forcibly repressed the whims of the  nobles and re-established the autocracy and the hereditary monarchy.  Having finished with his enemies in the north, he turned his attention to  the Greeks, with no less success. In 809 he captured from them the  important city of Sofia (the Roman Sardica, known to the Slavs as  Sredets), which is to-day the capital of Bulgaria. The loss of this city  was a blow to the Greeks, because it was a great centre of commerce and  also the point at which the commercial and strategic highways of the  peninsula met and crossed. The Emperor Nikiphoros, who wished to take his  revenge and recover his lost property, was totally defeated by the Bulgars  and lost his life in the Balkan passes in 811. After further victories, at  Mesembria (the modern Misivria) in 812 and Adrianople in 813, Krum  appeared before the capital, where he nearly lost his life in an ambush  while negotiating for peace. During preparations for a final assault on  Constantinople he died suddenly in 815. Though Krum cannot be said to have  introduced civilisation into Bulgaria, he at any rate increased its power  and gave it some of the more essential organs of government. He framed a  code of laws remarkable for their rigour, which was undoubtedly necessary  in such a community and beneficial in its effect. He repressed civil  strife, and by this means made possible the reawakening of commerce and  agriculture. His successor, of uncertain identity, founded in 822 the city  of Preslav (known to the Russians as Pereyaslav), situated in eastern  Bulgaria, between Varna and Silistria, which was the capital until 972.    The reign of Prince Boris (852-88) is remarkable because it witnessed the  definitive conversion to Christianity of Bulgaria and her ruler. It is  within this period also that fell the activities of the two great  'Slavonic' missionaries and apostles, the brothers Cyril and Methodius,  who are looked upon by all Slavs of the orthodox faith as the founders of  their civilisation. Christianity had of course penetrated into Bulgaria  (or Moesia, as it was then) long before the arrival of the Slavs and  Bulgars, but the influx of one horde of barbarians after another was  naturally not propitious to its growth. The conversion of Boris in 865,  which was brought about largely by the influence of his sister, who had  spent many years in Constantinople as a captive, was a triumph for Greek  influence and for Byzantium. Though the Church was at this time still  nominally one, yet the rivalry between Rome and Constantinople "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#4)"],[1,"to Camp Fire, and taking refuge behind her  favorite excuse, that of being in mourning, stated that she did not wish  Hinpoha to go out in society.    \"But this isn't 'society',\" broke in Hinpoha desperately.    \"A meeting of a club partakes of a social nature,\" returned her aunt,  \"and is not to be thought of.\" And there the matter rested.    So Nyoda had to depart without accomplishing her mission. Hinpoha,  utterly crushed, followed her to the door, and Nyoda gave her hand a  reassuring squeeze. \"Don't despair, dear,\" she whispered hopefully; \"she  will come around to it eventually, but it will take time. Be patient.  And in the meantime read this,\" and she slipped into her hand a tiny  copy of \"The Desert of Waiting.\" \"Just be true to the Law, and see if  you cannot find the roses among the thorns and from them distil the  precious ointment that will open the door of the City of Your Desire  later on.\"    Hinpoha thrust the little book into her blouse, and when she was safe in  her own room read it from cover to cover. When she finished there was a  song in her heart again and a light in her eyes. Resolutely she turned  her face to the East and began her long sojourn in the Desert of  Waiting.    Nyoda pondered the problem for a long while that night, and the next day  she went to call on Gladys's mother. Mrs. Evans had taken a great liking  to the popular young teacher of whom Gladys was so fond, and cordially  invited her to spend as much time as she could at the house with the  family. It was to her, then, that Nyoda appealed for advice in regard to  Hinpoha. Mrs. Evans made a slight grimace when the facts were laid  before her.    \"If that isn't just like Phoebe Bradford,\" she exclaimed indignantly.  \"Trying to shut up that poor girl like a nun to conform to some  moth-eaten ideas of hers! If the Judge were alive that house wouldn't  look as if there was a perpetual funeral going on! I certainly will call  and see if I can do anything to change her mind, although I doubt very  much if that could be accomplished by human means.\"    The next day Aunt Phoebe was agreeably surprised to receive a call from  Mrs. Evans, \"All the best people in the neighborhood are making haste to  call on the sister of Judge Bradford,\" she reflected complacently. Mrs.  Evans made herself very agreeable, speaking of many friends they had in  common, and finally led the conversation around to Hinpoha.    \"The child looks very pale,\" she said. \"I presume the death of her  parents was a terrible shock to her?\"    Aunt Phoebe dabbed her eyes with her black-bordered handkerchief. \"The  hand of misfortune has fallen heavily upon this house,\" she said  mournfully.    \"It has indeed!\" thought Mrs. Evans. Aloud she said, \"You must not let  the girl grieve herself sick. Cheerful company is what she needs at this  time. Make her go out with the Camp Fire Girls as much as possible.\"    Aunt Phoebe drew herself up rather stiffly. \"I do not approve of the  Camp Fire Girls,\" she said.    \"Not approve of the Camp Fire Girls!\" echoed Mrs. Evans in well-feigned  astonishment; \"why, what's wrong with them?\"    Just what the great objection was Aunt Phoebe was not prepared to say,  but she remarked that such nonsense had never been thought of in her  day. \"And, of course,\" she added, hiding behind her usual argument,  \"while we are in mourning my grandniece will not go out to any  gatherings.\"    \"Why, I wouldn't think of keeping Gladys home for that reason,\" said  Mrs. Evans, seeing the subterfuge. \"She went to a Camp Fire meeting the  day after her grandfather's funeral. It's not like going to a social  function, you know.\"    Aunt Phoebe shook her head, but her policy of seclusion for Hinpoha was  getting shaky. Mrs. Homer Evans was a power in the community, and what  she did set the fashion in a good many directions. Aunt Phoebe was very  anxious to keep her as a permanent acquaintance, and if Mrs. Evans gave  her sanction to this Camp Fire business, she wondered if she had not  better swallow her prejudice--outwardly at least, for she declared  inwardly that she had never heard of such foolishness in all her born  days. When Mrs. Evans went home Aunt Phoebe had actually promised that  after three months Hinpoha might attend the meetings as before. Those  three months of mourning, however, were sacred to her, and on no account  would she have consented to allow a single ray of cheer to enter the  house during that period.          CHAPTER III.      SOME TRIALS OF GENIUS.    \"The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.\"  Migwan drew the construction lines as indicated in the book and labored  valiantly to understand why the Angle A was equal to its alternate, DBA,  her brow puckered into a studious frown. Geometry was not her long suit,  her talents running to literature and languages. Outside the October sun  was shining on the crimson and yellow maples, making the long street a  scene of dazzling splendor. The carpet of dry leaves on the walk and  sidewalk tantalized Migwan with their crisp dryness; she longed to be  out swishing and crackling through them. She sighed and stirred  impatiently in her chair, wishing heartily that Euclid had died in his  cradle.    \"I can't study with all this noise going on!\" she groaned, flinging her  pencil and compass down in despair. Indeed, it would have taken a much  more keenly interested person than Migwan to have concentrated on a  geometry lesson just then. From somewhere upstairs there came an  ear-splitting din. It sounded like an earthquake in a tin shop, mingled  with the noise of the sky falling on a glass roof, and accompanied by  the tramping of an army; a noise such as could only have been produced  by an extremely large elephant or an extremely small boy amusing himself  indoors. Migwan rose resolutely and mounted the stairs to the room  overhead, where her twelve-year-old brother and two of his bosom friends  were holding forth. \"Tom,\" she said appealingly, \"wouldn't you and the  boys just as soon play outdoors or in somebody else's house? I simply  can't study with all that noise going on.\"    \"But the others have no punching bag,\" said Tom in an injured tone, \"and  Jim brought George over especially to-day to practice.\"    \"Can't you take the punching bag over to Jim's?\" suggested Migwan  desperately.    \"Sure,\" said Jim good-naturedly; \"that's a good idea.\" So the boys  unscrewed the object of attraction and departed with it, their pockets  bulging with ginger cookies which Migwan gave them as a reward for their  trouble. Silence fell on the house and Migwan returned to the mastering  of the sum of the angles. Geometry was the bane of her existence and she  was only cheered into digging away at it by the thought of the money  lying in her name in the bank, which she had received for giving the  clew leading to little Raymond Bartlett's discovery the summer before,  and which would pay her way to college for one year at least.    The theorem was learned at last so that she could make a recitation on  it, even if she did not understand it perfectly, and Migwan left it to  take up a piece of work which gave her as much pleasure as the other did  pain. This was the writing of a story which she intended to send away to  a magazine. She wrote it in the back of an old notebook, and when she  was not working at it she kept it carefully in the bottom of her  shirtwaist box, where the prying eyes of her younger sister would not  find it. She had all the golden dreams and aspirations of a young  authoress writing her first story, and her days were filled with a  secret delight when she thought of the riches that would soon be hers  when the story was accepted, as it of course would be. If she had known  then of the long years of cruel disillusionment that would drag their  weary length along until her efforts were finally crowned with success  it is doubtful whether she would have stayed in out of the October  sunshine so cheerfully and worked with such enthusiasm.    Migwan's family could have used to advantage all the gold which she was  dreaming of earning. After her father died her mother's income, from  various sources, amounted to only about seventy-five dollars a month,  which is not a great amount when there are three children to keep in  school, and it was a struggle all the way around to make both ends meet.  Mrs. Gardiner was a poor manager and kept no accounts, and so took no  notice of the small leaks that drained her purse from month to month.  She was fond of reading, as Migwan was, and sat up until midnight every  night burning gas. Then the next morning she would be too tired to get  up in time to get the children off to school, and they would depart with  a hasty bite, according to their own fancy, or without any breakfast at  all, if they were late. She bought ready-made clothes when she could  have made them herself at half the cost, and generally chose light  colors which soiled quickly. She never went to the store herself,  depending on Tom or scatter-brained Betty, her younger daughter, to do  her marketing, and in consequence paid the highest prices for  inferior-grade goods.    Thus the seventy-five dollars covered less ground every month as prices  mounted, and little bills began to be left outstanding. Part of the  income was from a house which rented for twenty dollars but this last  month the tenants had abruptly moved, and that much was cut off. Migwan,  unbusiness-like as she was, began to be worried about the condition of  their affairs, and worked on her story feverishly, that it might be  turned into money as soon as possible. She was deep in the intricacies  of literary construction when her mother entered the room, broom in hand  and dust cap on head, and sank into a chair.    \"Do you suppose you could finish this sweeping?\" she asked Migwan. \"My  back aches so I just can't stand up any longer.\"    \"Why can't Betty do it?\" asked"]]]
