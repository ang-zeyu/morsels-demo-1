A continuation of it (1852-59) brought the  story down to the accession of Louis Napoleon. A. was also the author of  a life of Marlborough, and of two standard works on the criminal law of  Scotland. In his private and official capacities he was highly respected,  and was elected Lord Rector successively of Marischal Coll., Aberdeen,  and of Glasgow University. He was created a baronet by Lord Derby in  1852.      ALLEN, CHARLES GRANT (1848-1899).--Scientific writer and novelist, _b._  in Canada, to which his _f._, a clergyman, had emigrated, and _ed._ at  Birmingham and Oxford. For a time he was a professor in a college for  negroes in Jamaica, but returning to England in 1876 devoted himself to  literature. His first books were on scientific subjects, and include  _Physiological AEsthetics_ (1877) and _Flowers and Their Pedigrees_. After  assisting Sir W.W. Hunter in his _Gazeteer of India_, he turned his  attention to fiction, and between 1884 and 1899 produced about 30 novels,  among which _The Woman Who Did_ (1895), promulgating certain startling  views on marriage and kindred questions, created some sensation. Another  work, _The Evolution of the Idea of God_, propounding a theory of  religion on heterodox lines, has the disadvantage of endeavouring to  explain everything by one theory. His scientific works also included  _Colour Sense_, _Evolutionist at Large_, _Colin Clout's Calendar_, and  the _Story of the Plants_, and among his novels may be added _Babylon_,  _In all Shades_, _Philistia_ (1884), _The Devil's Die_, and _The British  Barbarians_ (1896).      ALLINGHAM, WILLIAM (1824-1889).--Poet, the _s._ of a banker of English  descent, was _b._ at Ballyshannon, entered the customs service, and was  ultimately settled in London, where he contributed to _Leigh Hunt's  Journal_. Hunt introduced him to Carlyle and other men of letters, and in  1850 he _pub._ a book of poems, which was followed by _Day and Night  Songs_ (1854), _Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland_ (1864) (his most  ambitious, though not his most successful work), and _Collected Poems_ in  6 vols. (1888-93). He also edited _The Ballad Book_ for the _Golden  Treasury_ series in 1864. In 1870 he retired from the civil service and  became sub-editor of _Fraser's Magazine_ under Froude, whom he succeeded  as editor (1874-79). His verse is clear, fresh, and graceful. He married  Helen Paterson, the water colourist, whose idylls have made the name of  \"Mrs. Allingham\" famous also. He _d._ in 1889. Other works are _Fifty  Modern Poems_ (1865), _Songs, Poems, and Ballads_ (1877), _Evil May Day_  (1883), _Blackberries_ (1884), _Irish Songs and Poems_ (1887), and  _Varieties in Prose_ (1893). A selection from his diaries and  autobiography was _pub._ in 1906.      ALLSTON, WASHINGTON (1779-1843).--Painter and poet, _b._ in S. Carolina,  became a distinguished painter, and also wrote a good deal of verse  including _The Sylphs of the Seasons_, etc. (1813), and _The Two  Painters_, a satire. He also produced a novel, _Monaldi_. He was known as  \"the American Titian.\"      AMORY, THOMAS (1691(?)-1788).--Eccentric writer, was of Irish descent. In  1755 he _publ._ _Memoirs containing the lives of several ladies of Great  Britain, a History of Antiquities and Observations on the Christian  Religion_, which was followed by the _Life of John Buncle_ (1756),  practically a continuation. The contents of these works are of the most  miscellaneous description--philology, natural science, theology, and, in  fact, whatever occurred to the writer, treated without any system, but  with occasional originality and felicity of diction. The author, who was  probably more or less insane, is described as having a very peculiar  aspect, with the manner of a gentleman, scarcely ever stirring abroad  except at dusk. He reached the age of 97.      ANDERSON, ALEXANDER (1845-1909).--Poet, _s._ of a quarrier at Kirkconnel,  Dumfriesshire, became a surfaceman on the railway. Spending all his  leisure in self-culture, he mastered German, French, and Spanish  sufficiently to read the chief masterpieces in these languages. His  poetic vein, which was true if somewhat limited in range, soon manifested  itself, and his first book, _Songs of Labour_, appeared in 1873, and  there followed _Two Angels_ (1875), _Songs of the Rail_ (1878), and  _Ballads and Sonnets_ (1879). In the following year he was made assistant  librarian in the University of Edinburgh, and after an interval as  secretary to the Philosophical Institution there, he returned as Chief  Librarian to the university. Thereafter he wrote little. Of a simple and  gentle character, he made many friends, including the Duke of Argyll,  Carlyle, and Lord Houghton. He generally wrote under the name of  \"Surfaceman.\"      ANDREWES, LANCELOT (1555-1626).--Churchman and scholar, was _b._ in  London, and _ed._ at Merchant Taylor's School and Cambridge, where he  took a fellowship and taught divinity. After receiving various other  preferments he became Dean of Westminster, and a chaplain-in-ordinary to  Queen Elizabeth, who, however, did not advance him further on account of  his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. On the  accession, however, of James I., to whom his somewhat pedantic learning  and style of preaching recommended him, he rose into great favour, and  was made successively Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and, in 1618, of  Winchester. He attended the Hampton Court Conference, and took part in  the translation of the Bible, known as the _Authorised Version_, his  special work being given to the earlier parts of the Old Testament: he  acted, however, as a sort of general editor. He was considered as, next  to Ussher, the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great  reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and  artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste.  His doctrine was High Church, and in his life he was humble, pious, and  charitable. Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command  of Charles I.    There are lives by A.T. Russell (1863), and R.L. Ottley (1894);  _Devotions_ were edited by Rev. Dr. Whyte (1900).      ANSTEY, CHRISTOPHER (1724-1805).--Poet, _s._ of Dr. A., a wealthy  clergyman, rector of Brinkley, Cambridgeshire, was _ed._ at Eton and  Cambridge. He _pub._ in 1766 a satirical poem of considerable sparkle,  _The New Bath Guide_, from which Smollett is said to have drawn largely  in his _Humphrey Clinker_. He made many other excursions into literature  which are hardly remembered, and ended his days as a country squire at  the age of eighty.      D'ARBLAY, FRANCES (BURNEY) (1752-1840).--Novelist, _dau._ of Dr. Charles  B., a musician of some distinction, was _b._ at Lynn Regis, where her  _f._ was organist. Her mother having died while she was very young, and  her _f._, who had come to London, being too busy to give her any  attention, she was practically self-educated. Her first novel, _Evelina_,  _pub._ anonymously in 1778, at once by its narrative and comic power,  brought her fame, and, through Mrs. Thrale (_q.v._), she made the  acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, with whom she became a great favourite. Her  next literary venture was a comedy, _The Witlings_; but, by the advice of  her _f._, it was not put upon the stage. In 1782, however, she produced  _Cecilia_, which, like its predecessor, had an enormous sale, and which,  though not perhaps so popular as _Evelina_, added to her fame. She now  became the friend of Burke and other distinguished persons, including  Mrs. Delaney, through whom she became known to the royal family, and was  offered the appointment of Second Keeper of the Robes, which, with some  misgivings, she accepted. This situation did not prove a happy one, the  duties being menial, the society uncongenial, and the court etiquette  oppressive and injurious to her health, and in 1791 she obtained  permission to retire on a pension of L100. She had, during her connection  with the court, continued her _Diary_, which she had begun in girlhood,  and continued during her whole life, and which during this period  contains many interesting accounts of persons and affairs of note. She  married (1793) Gen. D'Arblay, a French _emigre_, their only income being  her slender pension. This she endeavoured to increase by producing a  tragedy, _Edwy and Elvira_, which failed. In 1795 she _pub._ by  subscription another novel, _Camilla_, which, though it did not add to  her reputation, considerably improved her circumstances, as it is said to  have brought her L3000. After some years spent in France, where her  husband had obtained employment, she returned to England and _pub._ her  last novel, _The Wanderer_, which fell flat. Her only remaining work was  a life of her father, written in an extraordinarily grandiloquent style.  She died in 1840, aged 87.      ARBUTHNOT, JOHN (1667-1735).--Physician and satirist, was _b._ in  Kincardineshire, and after studying at Aberdeen and Oxford, took his  degree of M.D. at St. Andrews. Settling in London, he taught mathematics.  Being by a fortunate accident at Epsom, he was called in to prescribe for  Prince George, who was suddenly taken ill there, and was so successful in  his treatment that he was appointed his regular physician. This  circumstance made his professional fortune, for his ability enabled him  to take full advantage of it, and in 1705 he became physician to the  Queen. He became the cherished friend of Swift and Pope, and himself  gained a high reputation as a wit and man of letters. His principal works  are the _Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus_, partly by Pope, but to which he  was the chief contributor, the _History of John Bull_ (1712), mainly  against the Duke of Marlborough, _A Treatise concerning the Altercation  or Scolding of the Ancients_, and the _Art of Political Lying_.

She wore a working-dress which  betokened little ease and less luxury, a robe of striped _Indienne_,  discolored and faded; a cotton handkerchief on her neck, her black  hair neatly braided, but like her shoes, somewhat soiled by the dust  of the road. Her features were fine and graceful, with that mild  and docile Asiatic expression, which renders any muscular tension  impossible, and gives utterance only to inspiring and attractive  candor. Her mouth was possibly a line too large, and her brow was  unwrinkled as that of a child. The lower part of her face was very  full, and was joined by full undulations, altogether feminine however  in their character, to a throat which was large and somewhat distended  at the middle, like that of the old Greek statues. Her glance had the  expression of the moonlight of her country rather than of its sun.  It was the expression of timidity mingled with confidence in the  indulgence of another, emanating from a forgetfulness of her own  nature. In fine, it was the image of good-feeling, impressed as well  on her air as on her heart, and which seem confident that others are  like her. It was evident that this woman, who was yet so agreeable,  must in her youth have been most attractive. She yet had what the  people (the language of which is so expressive) call the _seed of  beauty_, that _prestige_, that ray, that star, that essence, that  indescribable something, which attracts, charms, and enslaves us. When  she saw me, her embarrassment and blushes enabled me to contemplate  her calmly and to feel myself at once at ease with her. I begged her  to sit down at once on an orange-box over which was thrown a Syrian  mat, and to encourage her sat down in front of her. Her blushes  continued to increase, and she passed her dimpled but rather large  hand more than once over her eyes. She did not know how to begin  nor what to say. I sought to give her confidence, and by one or two  questions assisted her in opening the conversation she seemed both to  wish for and to fear.\"    [This girl is Reine-Garde, a peasant woman, attracted by a passionate  love of his poetry to visit Lamartine. She unfolds to him much that is  exquisitely reproduced in Genevieve. The romance bids fair to be one  of the most interesting this author has yet produced.]    \"Madame ----,\" said I to her. She blushed yet more.    \"I have no husband, Monsieur. I am an unmarried woman.\"    \"Ah! Mlle, will you be pleased to tell me why you have come so far,  and why you waited so long to speak with me? Can I be useful to you  in any manner? Have you any letter to give me from any one in your  neighborhood?\"    \"Ah, Monsieur, I have no letter, I have nothing to ask of you, and the  last thing in the world that I should have done, would have been to  get a letter from any of the gentlemen in my neighborhood to you. I  would not even have suffered them to know that I came to Marseilles  to see you. They would have thought me a vain creature, who sought to  magnify her importance by visiting people who are so famous. Ah, that  would never do!\"    \"What then do you wish to say?\"    \"Nothing, _Monsieur_.\"    \"How can that be? You should not _for nothing_ have wasted two days in  coming from Aix to Marseilles, and should not have waited for me here  until sunset, when to-morrow you must return home.\"    \"It is, however, true, Monsieur. I know you will think me very  foolish, but ... I have nothing to tell you, and not for a fortune  would I consent that people at Aix should know whither I am gone.\"    \"Something however induced you to come--you are not one of those  triflers who go hither and thither without a motive. I think you are  intellectual and intelligent. Reflect. What induced you to take a  place in the diligence and come to see me? Eh!\"    \"Well, sir,\" said she, passing her hands over her cheeks as if to wipe  away all blushes and embarrassment, and at the same time pushing her  long black curls, moist as they were with perspiration, beyond her  ears, \"I had an idea which permitted me neither to sleep by day nor  night; I said to myself, Reine, you must be satisfied. You must say  nothing to any one. You must shut up your shop on Saturday night as  you are in the habit of doing. You must take a place in the night  diligence and go on Sunday to Marseilles. You will go to see that  gentleman, and on Monday morning you can again be at work. All will  then be over and for once in your life you will have been satisfied  without your neighbors having once fancied for a moment that you have  passed the limits of the street in which you live.\"    \"Why, however, did you wish so much to see me? How did you even know  that I was here?\"    \"Thus, Monsieur: a person came to Aix who was very kind to me, for I  am the dressmaker of his daughters, having previously been a servant  in his mother's country-house. The family has always been kind  and attentive, because in Provence, the nobles do not despise the  peasants. Ah! it is far otherwise--some are lofty and others humble,  but their hearts are all alike. _Monsieur_ and the young ladies knew  how I loved to read, and that I am unable to buy books and newspapers.  They sometimes lent books to me, when they saw anything which they  fancied would interest me, such as fashion plates, engravings of  ladies' bonnets, interesting stories, like that of Reboul, the baker  of Nimes, Jasmin, the hairdresser of Agen, or _Monsieur_, the history  of your own life. They know, Monsieur, that above all things I love  poetry, especially that which brings tears into the eyes.\"    \"Ah, I know,\" said I with a smile, \"you are poetical as the winds  which sigh amid your olive-groves, or the dews which drip from your  fig trees.\"    \"No, Monsieur, I am only a mantua-maker--a poor seamstress in ...  street, in Aix, the name of which I am almost ashamed to tell you. I  am no finer lady than was my mother. Once I was servant and nurse in  the house of M.... Ah! they were good people and treated me always as  if I belonged to the family. I too thought I did. My health however,  obliged me to leave them and establish myself as a mantua-maker, in  one room, with no companion but a goldfinch. That, however, is not the  question you asked me,--why I have come hither? I will tell you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Truth is altogether ineffably, holily beautiful.

BY MISS ALICE CAREY.      From the pale, broken ruins of the heart,    The soul's bright wing, uplifted silently,    Sweeps thro' the steadfast depths of the mind's heaven,    Like the fixed splendor of the morning star--    Nearer and nearer to the wasteless flame    That in the centres of the universe    Burns through the o'erlapping centuries of time.    And shall it stagger midway on its path,    And sink its radiance low as the dull dust,    For the death-flutter of a fledgling hope?    Or, with the headlong phrensy of a fiend,    Front the keen arrows of Love's sunken sun,    For that, with nearer vision it discerns    What in the distance like ripe roses seemed    Crimsoning with odorous beauty the gray rocks    Are the red lights of wreckers!                                  Just as well    The obstinate traveler might in pride oppose    His puny shoulder to the icy slip    Of the blind avalanche, and hope for life;    Or Beauty press her forehead in the grave,    And think to rise as from the bridal bed.    But let the soul resolve its course shall be    Onward and upward, and the walls of pain    May build themselves about it as they will,    Yet leave it all-sufficient to itself.      How like the very truth a lie may seem!--    Led by that bright curse, Genius, some have gone    On the broad wake of visions wonderful    And seemed, to the dull mortals far below,    Unraveling the web of fate, at will.    And leaning on their own creative power,    As on the confident arm of buoyant Love.    But from the climbing of their wildering way    Many have faltered, fallen,--some have died,    Still wooing from across the lapse of years    The faded splendour of a morning dream,    And feeding sorrow with remembered smiles.    Love, that pale passion-flower of the heart,    Nursed into bloom and beauty by a breath,    With the resplendence of its broken light,    Even on the outposts of mortality,    Dims the still watchfires of the waiting soul.      O, tender-visaged Pity, stoop from heaven,    And from the much-loved bosom of the past    Draw back the nestling hand of Memory,    Though it be quivering and pale with pain;    And with the dead dust of departed Hope    Choke up and wither into barrenness    The sweetest fountain of the human heart,    And stay its channels everlastingly    From the endeavor of the loftier soul.    Nay, 'twere a task outbalancing thy power,    Nor can the almost-omnipotence of mind    Away from aching bind the bleeding heart,    Or keep at will its mighty sorrow down.    And, were the white flames of the world below    Binding my forehead with undying pain,    The lily crowns of heaven I would put back,    If thou wert there, lost light of my young dream!--    Hope, opening with the faint flowers of the wood,    Bloomed crimson with the summer's heavy kiss,    But autumn's dim feet left it in the dust,    And like tired reapers my lorn thoughts went down    To the gloom-harvest of a hopeless love,    For past all thought I loved thee: Listening close    From the soft hour when twilight's rosy"]]]
