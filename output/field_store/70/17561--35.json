As he brought his forequarters off the earth, he lunged at the  rider with open mouth. A sidestep that would have done credit to a  pugilist sent the youngster swerving past that danger. He leaped to the  saddle at the same time that the blood-bay came to his four feet.    The chorus in full cry was around the horse, four or five excited cow-  punchers waving their sombreros and yelling for horse or rider, according  to the gallantry of the fight.    The bay was in the air more than he was on the ground, eleven or twelve  hundred pounds of might, writhing, snapping, bolting, halting, sunfishing  with devilish cunning, dropping out of the air on one stiff foreleg with  an accompanying sway to one side that gave the rider the effect of a  cudgel blow at the back of the head and then a whip-snap to part the  vertebrae. Whirling on his hind legs, and again flinging himself  desperately on the ground, only to fail, come to his feet with the  clinging burden once more maddeningly in place, and go again through a  maze of fence-rowing and sun-fishing until suddenly he straightened out  and bolted down the slope like a runaway locomotive on a downgrade. A  terrifying spectacle, but the rider sat erect, with one arm raised high  above his head in triumph, and his yell trailing off behind him. From a  running gait the stallion fell into a smooth pace--a true wild pacer, his  hoofs beating the ground with the force and speed of pistons and hurling  himself forward with incredible strides. Horse and rider lurched out of  sight among the silver spruce.    \"By the Lord, wonderful!\" cried Vance Cornish.    He heard a stifled cry beside him, a cry of infinite pain.    \"Is--is it over?\"    And there sat Elizabeth the Indomitable with her face buried in her hands  like a girl of sixteen!    \"Of course it's over,\" said Vance, wondering profoundly.    She seemed to dread to look up. \"And--Terence?\"    \"He's all right. Ever hear of a horse that could get that young wildcat  out of the saddle? He clings as if he had claws. But--where did he get  that red devil?\"    \"Terence ran him down--in the mountains--somewhere,\" she answered,  speaking as one who had only half heard the question. \"Two months of  constant trailing to do it, I think. But oh, you're right! The horse is a  devil! And sometimes I think--\"    She stopped, shuddering. Vance had returned to the ranch only the day  before after a long absence. More and more, after he had been away, he  found it difficult to get in touch with things on the ranch. Once he had  been a necessary part of the inner life. Now he was on the outside.  Terence and Elizabeth were a perfectly completed circle in themselves.        CHAPTER 3      \"If Terry worries you like this,\" suggested her brother kindly, \"why  don't you forbid these pranks?\"    She looked at him as if in surprise.    \"Forbid Terry?\" she echoed, and then smiled. Decidedly this was her first  tone, a soft tone that came from deep in her throat. Instinctively Vance  contrasted it with the way she had spoken to him. But it was always this  way when Terry was mentioned. For the first time he saw it clearly. It  was amazing how blind he had been. \"Forbid Terence? Vance, that devil of  a horse is part of his life. He was on a hunting trip when he saw Le  Sangre--\"    \"Good Lord, did they call the horse that?\"    \"A French-Canadian was the first to discover him, and he gave the name.  And he's the color of blood, really. Well, Terence saw Le Sangre on a  hilltop against the sky. And he literally went mad. Actually, he struck  out on foot with his rifle and lived in the country and never stopped  walking until he wore down Le Sangre somehow and brought him back  hobbled--just skin and bones, and Terence not much more. Now Le Sangre is  himself again, and he and Terence have a fight--like that--every day. I  dream about it; the most horrible nightmares!\"    \"And you don't stop it?\"    \"My dear Vance, how little you know Terence! You couldn't tear that horse  out of his life without breaking his heart. I _know!_\"    \"So you suffer, day by day?\"    \"I've done very little else all my life,\" said Elizabeth gravely. \"And  I've learned to bear pain.\"    He swallowed. Also, he was beginning to grow irritated. He had never  before had a talk with Elizabeth that contained so many reefs that  threatened shipwreck. He returned to the gist of their conversation  rather too bluntly.    \"But to continue, Elizabeth, any banker would lend me money on my  prospects.\"    \"You mean the property which will come to you when I die?\"    He used all his power, but he could not meet her glance. \"You know that's  a nasty way to put it, Elizabeth.\"    \"Dear Vance,\" she sighed, \"a great many people say that I'm a hard woman.  I suppose I am. And I like to look facts squarely in the face. Your  prospects begin with my death, of course.\"    He had no answer, but bit his lip nervously and wished the ordeal would  come to an end.    \"Vance,\" she went on, \"I'm glad to have this talk with you. It's  something you have to know. Of course I'll see that during my life or my  death you'll be provided for. But as for your main prospects, do you know  where they are?\"    \"Well?\"    She was needlessly brutal about it, but as she had told him, her  education had been one of pain.    \"Your prospects are down there by the river on the back of Le Sangre.\"    Vance Cornish gasped.    \"I'll show you what I mean, Vance. Come along.\"    The moment she rose, some of her age fell from her. Her carriage was  erect. Her step was still full of spring and decision, as she led the way  into the house. It was a big, solid, two-story building which the  mightiest wind could not shake. Henry Cornish had merely founded the  house, just as he had founded the ranch; the main portion of the work had  been done by his daughter. And as they passed through, her stern old eye  rested peacefully on the deep, shadowy vistas, and her foot fell with  just pride on the splendid rising sweep of the staircase. They passed  into the roomy vault of the upper hall and went down to the end. She took  out a big key from her pocket and fitted it into the lock; then Vance  dropped his hand on her arm. His voice lowered.    \"You've made a mistake, Elizabeth. This is Father's room.\"    Ever since his death it had been kept unchanged, and practically  unentered save for an occasional rare day of work to keep it in order.  Now she nodded and resolutely turned the key and swung the door open.  Vance went in with an exclamation of wonder. It was quite changed from  the solemn old room and the brown, varnished woodwork which he  remembered. Cream-tinted paint now made the walls cool and fresh. The  solemn engravings no longer hung above the bookcases. And the bookcases  themselves had been replaced with built-in shelves pleasantly filled with  rich bindings, black and red and deep yellow-browns. A tall cabinet stood  open at one side filled with rifles and shotguns of every description,  and another cabinet was loaded with fishing apparatus. The stiff-backed  chairs had given place to comfortable monsters of easy lines. Vance  Cornish, as one in a dream, peered here and there.    \"God bless us!\" he kept repeating. \"God bless us! But where's there a  trace of Father?\"    \"I left it out,\" said Elizabeth huskily, \"because this room is meant  for--but let's go back. Do you remember that day twenty-four years ago  when we took Jack Hollis's baby?\"    \"When _you_ took it,\" he corrected. \"I disclaim all share in the idea.\"    \"Thank you,\" she answered proudly. \"At any rate, I took the boy and  called him Terence Colby.\"    \"Why that name,\" muttered Vance, \"I never could understand.\"    \"Haven't I told you? No, and I hardly know whether to trust even you with  the secret, Vance. But you remember we argued about it, and you said that  blood would out; that the boy would turn out wrong; that before he was  twenty-five he would have shot a man?\"    \"I believe the talk ran like that.\"    \"Well, Vance, I started out with a theory; but the moment I had that baby  in my arms, it became a matter of theory, plus, and chiefly plus. I kept  remembering what you had said, and I was afraid. That was why I worked up  the Colby idea.\"    \"That's easy to see.\"    \"It wasn't so easy to do. But I heard of the last of an old Virginia  family who had died of consumption in Arizona. I traced his family. He  was the last of it. Then it was easy to arrange a little story: Terence  Colby had married a girl in Arizona, died shortly after; the girl died  also, and I took the baby. Nobody can disprove what I say. There's not a  living soul who knows that Terence is the son of Jack Hollis--except you  and me.\"    \"How about the woman I got the baby from?\"    \"I bought her silence until fifteen years ago. Then she died, and now  Terry is convinced that he is the last representative of the Colby  family.\"    She laughed with excitement and beckoned him out of the room and into  another--Terry's room, farther down the hall. She pointed to a large  photograph of a solemn-faced man on the wall. \"You see that?\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"I got it when I took Terry to Virginia last winter--to see the old  family estate and go over the ground of the historic Colbys.\"    She laughed again happily.    \"Terry was wild with enthusiasm. He read everything he could lay his  hands on about the Colbys. Discovered the year they landed in Virginia;  how they fought in the Revolution; how they fought and died in the Civil  War. Oh, he knows every landmark in the history of 'his' family. Of  course, I encouraged him.\"    \"I know,\" chuckled Vance. \"Whenever he gets in a pinch, I've heard you  say: 'Terry, what should a Colby do?'\"    \"And,\" cut in Elizabeth, \"you must admit that it has worked. There isn't  a prouder, gentler, cleaner-minded boy in the world than Terry. Not  blood. It's the blood of Jack Hollis. But it's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#3)"],[1," over her companion's. Out of  the girlish sympathetic action a warm friendship was born.    \"I imagine things do happen here,\" said Mr. Sheppard, hoping to hear  more from Colonel Zane.    The colonel smiled grimly.    \"Every summer during fifteen years has been a bloody one on the  border. The sieges of Fort Henry, and Crawford's defeat, the biggest  things we ever knew out here, are matters of history; of course you  are familiar with them. But the numberless Indian forays and attacks,  the women who have been carried into captivity by renegades, the  murdered farmers, in fact, ceaseless war never long directed at any  point, but carried on the entire length of the river, are matters  known only to the pioneers. Within five miles of Fort Henry I can show  you where the laurel bushes grow three feet high over the ashes of two  settlements, and many a clearing where some unfortunate pioneer had  staked his claim and thrown up a log cabin, only to die fighting for  his wife and children. Between here and Fort Pitt there is only one  settlement, Yellow Creek, and most of its inhabitants are survivors of  abandoned villages farther up the river. Last summer we had the  Moravian Massacre, the blackest, most inhuman deed ever committed.  Since then Simon Girty and his bloody redskins have lain low.\"    \"You must always have had a big force,\" said Sheppard.    \"We've managed always to be strong enough, though there never were a  large number of men here. During the last siege I had only forty in  the fort, counting men, women and boys. But I had pioneers and women  who could handle a rifle, and the best bordermen on the frontier.\"    \"Do you make a distinction between pioneers and bordermen?\" asked  Sheppard.    \"Indeed, yes. I am a pioneer; a borderman is an Indian hunter, or  scout. For years my cabins housed Andrew Zane, Sam and John McCollock,  Bill Metzar, and John and Martin Wetzel, all of whom are dead. Not one  saved his scalp. Fort Henry is growing; it has pioneers, rivermen,  soldiers, but only two bordermen. Wetzel and Jonathan are the only  ones we have left of those great men.\"    \"They must be old,\" mused Helen, with a dreamy glow still in her eyes.    \"Well, Miss Helen, not in years, as you mean. Life here is old in  experience; few pioneers, and no bordermen, live to a great age.  Wetzel is about forty, and my brother Jonathan still a young man; but  both are old in border lore.\"    Earnestly, as a man who loves his subject, Colonel Zane told his  listeners of these two most prominent characters of the border.  Sixteen years previously, when but boys in years, they had cast in  their lot with his, and journeyed over the Virginian Mountains, Wetzel  to devote his life to the vengeful calling he had chosen, and Jonathan  to give rein to an adventurous spirit and love of the wilds. By some  wonderful chance, by cunning, woodcraft, or daring, both men had lived  through the years of border warfare which had brought to a close the  careers of all their contemporaries.    For many years Wetzel preferred solitude to companionship; he roamed  the wilderness in pursuit of Indians, his life-long foes, and seldom  appeared at the settlement except to bring news of an intended raid of  the savages. Jonathan also spent much time alone in the woods, or  scouting along the river. But of late years a friendship had ripened  between the two bordermen. Mutual interest had brought them together  on the trail of a noted renegade, and when, after many long days of  patient watching and persistent tracking, the outlaw paid an awful  penalty for his bloody deeds, these lone and silent men were friends.    Powerful in build, fleet as deer, fearless and tireless, Wetzel's  peculiar bloodhound sagacity, ferocity, and implacability, balanced by  Jonathan's keen intelligence and judgment caused these bordermen to  become the bane of redmen and renegades. Their fame increased with  each succeeding summer, until now the people of the settlement looked  upon wonderful deeds of strength and of woodcraft as a matter of  course, rejoicing in the power and skill with which these men  were endowed.    By common consent the pioneers attributed any mysterious deed, from  the finding of a fat turkey on a cabin doorstep, to the discovery of a  savage scalped and pulled from his ambush near a settler's spring, to  Wetzel and Jonathan. All the more did they feel sure of this  conclusion because the bordermen never spoke of their deeds. Sometimes  a pioneer living on the outskirts of the settlement would be awakened  in the morning by a single rifle shot, and on peering out would see a  dead Indian lying almost across his doorstep, while beyond, in the  dim, gray mist, a tall figure stealing away. Often in the twilight on  a summer evening, while fondling his children and enjoying his smoke  after a hard day's labor in the fields, this same settler would see  the tall, dark figure of Jonathan Zane step noiselessly out of a  thicket, and learn that he must take his family and flee at once to  the fort for safety. When a settler was murdered, his children carried  into captivity by Indians, and the wife given over to the power of  some brutal renegade, tragedies wofully frequent on the border, Wetzel  and Jonathan took the trail alone. Many a white woman was returned  alive and, sometimes, unharmed to her relatives; more than one maiden  lived to be captured, rescued, and returned to her lover, while almost  numberless were the bones of brutal redmen lying in the deep and  gloomy woods, or bleaching on the plains, silent, ghastly reminders of  the stern justice meted out by these two heroes.    \"Such are my two bordermen, Miss Sheppard. The fort there, and all  these cabins, would be only black ashes, save for them, and as for us,  our wives and children--God only knows.\"    \"Haven't they wives and children, too?\" asked Helen.    \"No,\" answered Colonel Zane, with his genial smile. \"Such joys are not  for bordermen.\"    \"Why not? Fine men like them deserve happiness,\" declared Helen.    \"It is necessary we have such,\" said the colonel simply, \"and they  cannot be bordermen unless free as the air blows. Wetzel and Jonathan  have never had sweethearts. I believe Wetzel loved a lass once; but he  was an Indian-killer whose hands were red with blood. He silenced his  heart, and kept to his chosen, lonely life. Jonathan does not seem to  realize that women exist to charm, to please, to be loved and married.  Once we twitted him about his brothers doing their duty by the border,  whereupon he flashed out: 'My life is the border's: my sweetheart is  the North Star!'\"    Helen dreamily watched the dancing, dimpling waves that broke on the  stones of the river shore. All unconscious of the powerful impression  the colonel's recital had made upon her, she was feeling the greatness  of the lives of these bordermen, and the glory it would now be for her  to share with others the pride in their protection.    \"Say, Sheppard, look here,\" said Colonel Zane, on the return to his  cabin, \"that girl of yours has a pair of eyes. I can't forget the way  they flashed! They'll cause more trouble here among my garrison than  would a swarm of redskins.\"    \"No! You don't mean it! Out here in this wilderness?\" queried Sheppard  doubtfully.    \"Well, I do.\"    \"O Lord! What a time I've had with that girl! There was one man  especially, back home, who made our lives miserable. He was rich and  well born; but Helen would have none of him. He got around me, old  fool that I am! Practically stole what was left of my estate, and  gambled it away when Helen said she'd die before giving herself to  him. It was partly on his account that I brought her away. Then there  were a lot of moon-eyed beggars after her all the time, and she's  young and full of fire. I hoped I'd marry her to some farmer out here,  and end my days in peace.\"    \"Peace? With eyes like those? Never on this green earth,\" and Colonel  Zane laughed as he slapped his friend on the shoulder. \"Don't worry,  old fellow. You can't help her having those changing dark-blue eyes  any more than you can help being proud of them. They have won me,  already, susceptible old backwoodsman! I'll help you with this  spirited young lady. I've had experience, Sheppard, and don't you  forget it. First, my sister, a Zane all through, which is saying  enough. Then as sweet and fiery a little Indian princess as ever  stepped in a beaded moccasin, and since, more than one beautiful,  impulsive creature. Being in authority, I suppose it's natural that  all the work, from keeping the garrison ready against an attack, to  straightening out love affairs, should fall upon me. I'll take the  care off your shoulders; I'll keep these young dare-devils from  killing each other over Miss Helen's favors. I certainly--Hello! There  are strangers at the gate. Something's up.\"    Half a dozen rough-looking men had appeared from round the corner of  the cabin, and halted at the gate.    \"Bill Elsing, and some of his men from Yellow Creek,\" said Colonel  Zane, as he went toward the group.    \"Hullo, Kurnel,\" was the greeting of the foremost, evidently the  leader. \"We've lost six head of hosses over our way, an' are out  lookin' 'em up.\"    \"The deuce you have! Say, this horse-stealing business is getting  interesting. What did you come in for?\"    \"Wal, we meets Jonathan on the ridge about sunup, an' he sent us back  lickety-cut. Said he had two of the hosses corralled, an' mebbe Wetzel  could git the others.\"    \"That's strange,\" replied Colonel Zane thoughtfully.    \"'Pears to me Jack and Wetzel hev some redskins treed, an' didn't want  us to spile the fun. Mebbe there wasn't scalps enough to go round.  Anyway, we come in, an' we'll hang up here to-day.\"    \"Bill, who's doing this horse-stealing?\"    \"Damn if I know. It's a mighty pert piece of work. I've a mind it's  some slick white fellar, with Injuns backin' him.\"    Helen noted, when she "]]]
