This, in general outline, is the cause of  Cuba's slow progress until the 19th Century, and the explanation of its  failure to make more rapid progress during that century.    Naturally, under such conditions, bribery of officials and smuggling became  active and lucrative enterprises. It may be said, in strict confidence  between writer and reader, that Americans were frequently the parties of  the other part in these transactions. In search through a considerable  number of American histories, I have been unable to find definite  references to trade with Cuba, yet there seems to be abundant reason for  belief that such trade was carried on. There are many references to trade  with the West Indies as far back as 1640 and even a year or two earlier,  but allusions to trade with Cuba do not appear, doubtless for the reason  that it was contraband, a violation of both Spanish and British laws. There  was evidently some relaxation toward the close of the 18th Century.  There are no records of the commerce of the American colonies, and only  fragmentary records between 1776 and 1789. The more elaborate records of  1789 and following years show shipments of fish, whale oil, spermaceti  candles, lumber, staves and heading, and other articles to the \"Spanish  West Indies,\" in which group Cuba was presumably included. The records of  the time are somewhat unreliable. It was a custom for the small vessels  engaged in that trade to take out clearance papers for the West Indies. The  cargo might be distributed in a number of ports, and the return cargo might  be similarly collected. For the year 1795, the records of the United States  show total imports from the Spanish West Indies as valued at $1,740,000,  and exports to that area as valued at $1,390,000. In 1800, the imports were  $10,588,000, and the exports $8,270,000. Just how much of this was trade  with Cuba, does not appear. Because of the trade increase at that time,  and because of other events that, soon afterward, brought Cuba into more  prominent notice, this period has been chosen as the line of division  between the Old and the New Cuba.    Compared with the wonderful fertility of Cuba, New England is a sterile  area. Yet in 1790, a hundred and seventy years after its settlement, the  latter had a population a little exceeding a million, while the former, in  1792, or two hundred and eighty years after its occupation, is officially  credited with a population of 272,300. Of these, 153,559 were white and  118,741 were colored. Several forces came into operation at this time, and  population increased rapidly, to 572,363 in 1817, and to 704,465 in 1827.  In 1841, it was a little more than a million. But the increase in colored  population, by the importation of African slaves, outstripped the increase  by the whites. In 1841, the population was divided into 418,291 whites and  589,333 colored. The importation of slaves having declined, the year 1861  shows a white preponderance, since continued and substantially increased.  Among the forces contributing to Cuba's rapid growth during this period  were a somewhat greater freedom of trade; the revolution in the neighboring  island of Haiti and Santo Domingo, that had its beginning in 1791 and  culminated, some ten years later, in the rule of Toussaint L'Ouverture; and  an increased demand for sugar. One result of the Haitian disorder was the  arrival, in eastern Cuba, of a large number of exiles and emigrants who  established extensive coffee plantations. During the first hundred and  fifty years of Cuba's history, the principal industry of the island was  cattle raising, aside from the domestic industry of food supply. The  proprietors lived, usually, in the cities and maintained their vast estates  in the neighborhood. To this, later on, were added the production of  honey and wax and the cultivation of tobacco. With the period now under  consideration, there came the expansion of the coffee and sugar industries.  The older activities do not appear to have been appreciably lessened; the  others were added on.    Europe and the Western Hemisphere were at that time in a state of general  upheaval and rearrangement. Following the American Revolution, there came  the French Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the war of 1812 between the  United States and England; and the general revolt of the Spanish colonies.  The world was learning new lessons, adopting new policies, in which the  Spanish colonial system was a blunder the folly of which Spain did not  even then fully realize. Yet from it all, by one means and another, Cuba  benefited. Spain was fortunate in its selection of Governors-General sent  out at this time. Luis de Las Casas, who arrived in 1790, is credited with  much useful work. He improved roads and built bridges; established schools  and the _Casa de Beneficencia_, still among the leading institutions in  Havana; paved the streets of Havana; improved as far as he could the  commercial conditions; and established the _Sociedad Patriotica_, sometimes  called the _Sociedad Economica_, an organization that has since contributed  immeasurably to Cuba's welfare and progress. He was followed by others  whose rule was creditable. But the principal evils, restricted commerce  and burdensome taxation, were not removed, although world conditions  practically compelled some modification of the commercial regulations. In  1801 the ports of the island were thrown open to the trade of friendly and  neutral nations. Eight years later, foreign commerce was again prohibited.  In 1818, a new system was established, that of a tariff so highly favorable  to merchandise from Spain that it was by no means unusual for goods to  be shipped to that country, even from the United States, and from there  reshipped to Cuba. Changes in the rates were made from time to time, but  the system of heavy discrimination in favor of Spanish goods in Spanish  ships continued until the equalization of conditions under the order of the  Government of Intervention, in 1899.    In his book published in 1840, Mr. Turnbull states that \"the mercantile  interests of the island have been greatly promoted by the relaxation of  those restrictive regulations which under the old peninsular system bound  down all foreign commerce with the colonies of Spain, and laid it prostrate  at the feet of the mother-country. It cannot be said that the sound  principles of free trade, in any large or extended sense of the term,  have been recognized or acted upon even at the single port of Havana. The  discriminating duties imposed by the supreme government of Madrid on the  natural productions, manufactures, and shipping of foreign countries, in  contradistinction to those of Spain, are so stringent and so onerous as  altogether to exclude the idea of anything approaching to commercial  freedom. There is no longer, it is true, any absolute prohibition, but in  many cases the distinguishing duties are so heavy as to defeat their own  object, and, in place of promoting the interests of the mother-country,  have had little other effect than the establishment of an extensive and  ruinous contraband.\" Under such conditions as those existing in Cuba,  from its beginning practically until the establishment of its political  independence, industrial development and commercial expansion are more than  difficult.    One of the natural results of such a system appeared in the activities of  smugglers. The extent to which that industry was carried on cannot, of  course, be even guessed. Some have estimated that the merchandise imported  in violation of the laws equalled in value the merchandise entered at  the custom houses. An official publication (American) states that \"from  smuggling on a large scale and privateering to buccaneering and piracy is  not a long step, and under the name of privateers French, Dutch, English,  and American smugglers and buccaneers swarmed the Caribbean Sea and the  Gulf of Mexico for more than two centuries, plundering Spanish _flotas_  and attacking colonial settlements. Among the latter, Cuba was the chief  sufferer.\" Had Cuba's coasts been made to order for the purpose, they could  hardly have been better adapted to the uses of smugglers. Off shore, for  more than half its coast line, both north and south, are small islands  and keys with narrow and shallow passages between them, thus making an  excellent dodging area for small boats if pursued by revenue vessels.  Thoroughly familiar with these entrances and hiding places, smugglers could  land their goods almost at will with little danger of detection or capture.    Another heavy handicap on the economic progress of the island appears in  the system of taxation. Regarding this system, the Census of 1899 reports  as follows:    \"Apart from imports and exports, taxes were levied on real and personal  property and on industries and commerce of all kinds. Every profession,  art, or manual occupation contributed its quota, while, as far back as  1638, seal and stamp taxes were established on all judicial business and  on all kinds of petitions and claims made to official corporations, and  subsequently on all bills and accounts. These taxes were in the form of  stamps on official paper and at the date of American occupation the paper  cost from 35 cents to $3 a sheet. On deeds, wills, and other similar  documents the paper cost from 35 cents to $37.50 per sheet, according to  the value of the property concerned. Failure to use even the lowest-priced  paper involved a fine of $50.    \"There was also a municipal tax on the slaughter of cattle for the market.  This privilege was sold by the municipal council to the highest bidder,  with the result that taxes were assessed on all animals slaughtered,  whether for the market or for private consumption, with a corresponding  increase in the price of meat.    \"Another tax established"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11487"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

[As Sir Walter Scott's new work has not reached us in time to enable us  to fill in the outline of the story in our present Number, we give a few  sketchy extracts, or portraits,--such as will increase the interest for  the appearance of the Narrative.    There are some admirable specimens of Swiss scenery, which have the  effect of sublime painting: witness the following attempt of two  travellers, father and son, who with their guide, are bewildered in the  mountains by a sudden storm. The younger attempts to scale a broken path  on the side of the precipice:]    Thus estimating the extent of his danger by the measure of sound sense  and reality, and supported by some degree of practice in such exercise,  the brave youth went forward on his awful journey, step by step, winning  his way with a caution, and fortitude, and presence of mind, which alone  could have saved him from instant destruction. At length he gained a  point where a projecting rock formed the angle of the precipice, so far  as it had been visible to him from the platform. This, therefore, was  the critical point of his undertaking; but it was also the most perilous  part of it. The rock projected more than six feet forward over the  torrent, which he heard raging at the depth of a hundred yards beneath,  with a noise like subterranean thunder. He examined the spot with the  utmost care, and was led by the existence of shrubs, grass, and even  stunted trees, to believe that this rock marked the farthest extent of  the slip, or slide of earth, and that, could he but round the angle of  which it was the termination, he might hope to attain the continuation  of the path which had been so strangely interrupted by this convulsion  of nature. But the crag jutted out so much as to afford no possibility  of passing either under or around it; and as it rose several feet above  the position which Arthur had attained, it was no easy matter to climb  over it. This was, however, the course which he chose, as the only mode  of surmounting what he hoped might prove the last obstacle to his voyage  of discovery. A projecting tree afforded him the means of raising and  swinging himself up to the top of the crag. But he had scarcely planted  himself on it, had scarcely a moment to congratulate himself, on seeing,  amid a wild chaos of cliffs and woods, the gloomy ruins of Geierstein,  with smoke arising, and indicating something like a human habitation  beside them, when, to his extreme terror, he felt the huge cliff on  which he stood tremble, stoop slowly forward, and gradually sink from  its position. Projecting as it was, and shaken as its equilibrium had  been by the recent earthquake, it lay now so insecurely poised, that its  balance was entirely destroyed, even by the addition of the young man's  weight. Aroused by the imminence of the danger, Arthur, by an  instinctive attempt at self-preservation, drew cautiously back from the  falling crag into the tree by which he had ascended, and turned his head  back as if spell-bound, to watch the descent of the fatal rock from  which he had just retreated. It tottered for two or three seconds, as if  uncertain which way to fall; and had it taken a sidelong direction, must  have dashed the adventurer from his place of refuge, or borne both the  tree and him headlong down into the river. After a moment of horrible  uncertainty, the power of gravitation determined a direct and forward  descent. Down went the huge fragment, which must have weighed at least  twenty tons, rending and splintering in its precipitate course the trees  and bushes which it encountered, and settling at length in the channel  of the torrent, with a din equal to the discharge of a hundred pieces of  artillery. The sound was re-echoed from bank to bank, from precipice to  precipice, with emulative thunders; nor was the tumult silent till it  rose into the region of eternal snows, which, equally insensible to  terrestrial sounds, and unfavourable to animal life, heard the roar in  their majestic solitude, but suffered it to die away without a  responsive voice.    The solid rock had trembled and rent beneath his footsteps; and  although, by an effort rather mechanical than voluntary, he had  withdrawn himself from the instant ruin attending its descent, he felt  as if the better part of him, his firmness of mind and strength of body,  had been rent away with the descending rock, as it fell thundering,  with clouds of dust and smoke, into the torrents and whirlpools of the  vexed gulf beneath. In fact, the seaman swept from the deck of a wrecked  vessel, drenched in the waves, and battered against the rocks on  the shore, does not differ more from the same mariner, when, at the  commencement of the gale, he stood upon the deck of his favourite  ship, proud of her strength and his own dexterity, than Arthur, when  commencing his journey, from the same Arthur, while clinging to the  decayed trunk of an old tree, from which, suspended between heaven and  earth, he saw the fall of the crag which he had so nearly accompanied.  The effects of his terror, indeed, were physical as well as moral, for  a thousand colours played before his eyes; he was attacked by a sick  dizziness, and deprived at once of the obedience of those limbs which  had hitherto served him so admirably; his arms and hands, as if no  longer at his own command, now clung to the branches of the tree, with a  cramp-like tenacity, over which he seemed to possess no power, and now  trembled in a state of such complete nervous relaxation, as led him to  fear that they were becoming unable to support him longer in his  position.    [We must leave the reader here, although in dire suspense--and we regret  to do so, because a beautiful incident follows--to give the following  exquisite sketch of the heroine--a Swiss maiden. We will endeavour to  connect these passages with our abridgment of the narrative.]    An upper vest, neither so close as to display the person--a habit  forbidden by the sumptuary laws of the canton--nor so loose as to be an  encumbrance in walking or climbing, covered a close tunic of a different  colour, and came down beneath the middle of the leg, but suffered the  ancle, in all its fine proportions, to be completely visible. The foot  was defended by a sandal, the point of which was turned upwards, and the  crossings and knots of the strings which secured it on the front of the  leg were garnished with silver rings. The upper vest was gathered round  the middle by a sash of parti-coloured silk, ornamented with twisted  threads of gold; while the tunic, open at the throat, permitted the  shape and exquisite whiteness of a well-formed neck to be visible at the  collar, and for an inch or two beneath. The small portion of the throat  and bosom thus exposed was even more brilliantly fair than was promised  by the countenance, which last bore some marks of having been freely  exposed to the sun and air--by no means in a degree to diminish its  beauty, but just so far as to show that the maiden possessed the health  which is purchased by habits of rural exercise. Her long, fair hair fell  down in a profusion of curls on each side of a face whose blue eyes,  lovely features, and dignified simplicity of expression, implied at once  a character of gentleness, and of the self-relying resolution of a mind  too virtuous to suspect evil, and too noble to fear it. Above these  locks beauty's natural and most beseeming ornament--or rather, I should  say, amongst them--was placed the small bonnet, which, from its size,  little answered the purpose of protecting the head, but served to  exercise the ingenuity of the fair wearer, who had not failed, according  to the prevailing custom of the mountain maidens, to decorate the tiny  cap with a heron's feather, and the then unusual luxury of a small and  thin chain of gold, long enough to encircle the cap four or five times,  and having the ends secured under a broad medal of the same costly  metal. I have only to add, that the stature of the young person was  something above the common size, and that the whole contour of her form,  without being in the slightest degree masculine, resembled that of  Minerva, rather than the proud beauties of Juno, or the yielding graces  of Venus. The noble brow, the well-formed and active limbs, the firm and  yet light step; above all, the total absence of any thing resembling the  consciousness of personal beauty, and the open and candid look, which  seemed desirous of knowing nothing that was hidden, and conscious that  she herself had nothing to hide, were traits not unworthy of the goddess  of wisdom and of chastity.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SELECTOR, AND LITERARY NOTICES"]]]
