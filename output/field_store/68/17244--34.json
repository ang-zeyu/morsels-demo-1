There  is a wide difference between naturalists who compile, and form their  theories from books, and those who study nature, and think for themselves;  and nothing will result from the first but mischief to the science, and  perplexity to the student.    Our figure is from a specimen brought from Demerara by C. Edmonston, Esq.;  another is in the possession of A. MacLeay, Esq. Though rare in our  cabinets, M. Le Vaillant says it is common in Cayenne. He has given a  beautiful figure of the female, which is entirely green.    Total length six inches. Plumage above entirely green, beneath paler and  inclining to yellow; just under the lower mandible is a small  snuff-coloured spot, and a very narrow line of the same in front just above  the nostrils; the quills dark-green, the greater ones on their outside base  are blue, with which the head is also tinged. The spurious wings are  entirely of a rich and clear orange. Inner wing-covers green. Quills inside  greenish-blue, except on each side the shafts, where there is a line of  black. Tail short, cuneated, hardly projecting an inch beyond the wings,  both above and below green: the interior margin dirty-yellow, the feathers  pointed. Bill and legs flesh-colour.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 2    [Illustration]    SITTA frontalis.    _Blue Nuthatch._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum rectissimum, acutum, compressum; utroque mandibulo ad apicem      aeque inclinato; apice integro cuneo compresso simili.

Banks from Ceylon, that I  discovered the species had already been included in the Doctor's account of  the birds of Java, presented to the Linnaean Society, where he has  described it under the name of _Orthorynchus frontalis_.    The specific name of its first describer is of course retained: with  respect, however, to its generic situation, I must be allowed to dissent  from considering it as a distinct genus, merely from the prolongation of  the hinder toe being somewhat more developed than in _Sitta Europaea_ and  _Carolinensis_, both which birds are now before me, and which in themselves  differ in the relative proportion of this part: thus in _S. Carolinensis_  the hind toe and claw is two-tenths of an inch shorter than the leg; in _S.  Europaea_ it is one-tenth shorter; and in the present species it just  exceeds that of the leg: in every other respect not the slightest  difference I apprehend will be observed ....    Total length five inches. Size of the European Nuthatch. Bill, from the  angle of the mouth to the tip, eight lines; front of the head velvet-black,  continued in a stripe of the same colour over the eye, and terminating  above the ear feathers: the upper plumage is of a rich blue, more brilliant  on the head, and paler on the front, and external margins of the quills.  Spurious wings and lesser quills black margined with blue. Inner  wing-covers deep black; the under plumage is a light-brown, changing to  lilac on the ears and sides of the neck, and tinged with cinereous on the  flanks and vent: the chin is white; tail even, the two middle feathers  blue, the rest more or less black, having the external margins and tips  blue. The outer quill of the wings is short, the second and third longest  and equal, the fourth rather less; the hind toe with the claw, measures one  inch in a straight line.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 3    [Illustration]    MITRA zonata.    _Zoned Mitre._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa inaequaliter fusiformis, spira producta attenuata, labio      exteriore intus edentulo.

My  friend Dr. Leach, with his usual liberality, permitted me to draw the  accompanying figure of it at the British Museum, where it is now deposited.    It appears to have been taken near Nice in the Mediterranean, adhering to a  sounding-line, in very deep water; a very singular locality, since nearly  all the Mitres have generally been supposed to inhabit the tropical seas,  or at least far from the coasts of Europe. It should, however, be remarked,  that _Cypraea lurida_, an Asiatic shell, I have found on the shores of  Greece: and C. Ulysses, in his travels in the kingdom of Naples, enumerates  several shells as inhabiting the warm shores of the Tarentine Bay, which  are generally known only as natives of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. These  facts, with many others, prove the physical distribution of _Molluscae_ to  be less decidedly marked than almost any other class of animals.    This genus is included with that of _Voluta_ by Linnaeus and our own  writers, although long ago justly separated by the continental zoologists.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 4    [Illustration]    BULIMUS melastomus.    _Blackmouthed Bulimus._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa ovalis, vel oblongo-ovalis.

While travelling among the  forests of Brazil, in the province of Bahia, I found the shell here figured  one morning on the leaves of a _Solanum_. I not only searched myself, but  promised as a reward to any of my Indians who would bring me another, a  two-bladed Birmingham knife!--the greatest temptation they could have!--but  in vain; for I never saw another before or since.    There are many peculiar characters presented in this species independent of  its colour: the spiral whorls are strongly plaited longitudinally about  half their length, and marked very slightly (but sufficiently distinct)  with several oblique indented striae; the principal whorl has a row of  indented and unequal sulcations near the suture, and a slight appearance of  elevation along the white transverse band; the outer lip is thick, broad,  and flattened beneath; but the margin is reflected back, and forms a  prominent rim on the upper surface. The shell, when viewed closely, appears  rough with minute scale-like elevations, very much resembling shagreen.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 5    [Illustration]    COLIAS Statira.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Palpi breves, curvati, compressi ad linguam, squamis dense tecti.

The species are numerous, and are found both in temperate and tropical  seas; two or three inhabit our own coasts, but by far the greater number  are found in the Asiatic Ocean. They are subject to variation in their  colour; and this, joined with a general resemblance in form, has rendered  the discrimination of the species very difficult. I have, however,  remarked, that the various modifications of the umbilicus, and the  termination of the pillar (which is indicated in many species by an  elevated ridge or rib within the umbilicus) is a certain and constant  indication, presenting the same peculiarity through all the individuals of  a species, even in the young state. This termination of the pillar has been  mistaken for the inner lip, which, on the contrary, is always above the  umbilicus, which, if closed, is not closed by the lip, but by the thickened  termination of the pillar or columella.    The two most striking varieties are here figured of this species, which is  sufficiently described in the specific character. I believe it is found  both in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 76    [Illustration]    MEROPS Savignii,    _Black-capped Bee-eater._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 8.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _M. viridis, subtus albescens, uropygio caudaque caeruleis; vertice,      striga oculari, fasciaque lata collari nigris; mento, superciliisque      albis; rectricibus mediis elongatis._        Green; beneath whitish; rump and tail blue; crown of the head, eye      stripe, and broad band across the neck, black; chin and eye-brows      white; two middle tail feathers lengthened.           *       *       *       *       *    This Bird was pointed out to me by Professor Temminck as described by Le  Vaillant in his work on this family, under the name here given; on this  authority, therefore, I have been obliged to rest, for I have in vain  turned over the catalogues of all the public libraries in the metropolis,  in the hope of seeing the work, and ascertaining the fact.

The thorough investigation of these is a work of no  ordinary labour; and, until this is done, it appears most advisable to let  the generic distinction remain, as given by Latreille, though there can be  no doubt that among them distinct groups will be detected.    Cramer's figure will not indicate even the genus, and Fabricius describes  the body as white; the tip ferruginous; in this it is yellow, tipped with  red.    Mr. Haworth obliged me with this insect, which Fabricius notes as African.           *       *       *       *       *    BOTIS bicolor,    _Black and White Gauze-wing._           *       *       *       *       *        _B. alis anticis fuscis, punctis duabus angulatis transversis albis;      posticis ad basin albis._        Anterior wings, brown, with two transverse angulated white spots;      posterior white at the base.           *       *       *       *       *    From the same collection as the preceding; the margin of the thorax and  body are white.
