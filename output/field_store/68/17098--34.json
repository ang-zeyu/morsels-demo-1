Laura had heard it twenty times,--for she had \"stood up\" with twenty of  the girls, who had dared The Enterprise of Life before her! Nay, Laura  could repeat, with all the emphasis, the most pathetic passage of the  whole,--\"And above all,--my beloved young friends,--first of all and  last of all,--let me beseech you as you climb the hill of life together,  hand with hand, and step with step,--that you will look beyond the  crests upon its summit to the eternal lights which blaze in the  infinite heaven of the Better Land beyond.\" Twenty times had Laura heard  this passage,--nay, ten times, I am afraid, had she, in an honest and  friendly way, repeated it, under strict vows of secrecy, to the  edification of circles of screaming girls. But now the dear child looked  truly and loyally into the old man's face, as he went on from word to  word, and only thought of him, and of how noble and true he was,--and of  the Great Master whom he represented there,--and it was just as real to  her and to Tom Cutts that they must look into the Heaven of heavens for  life and strength, as Parson Spaulding wanted it to be. When he prayed  with all his heart, she prayed; what he hoped, she hoped; what he  promised for her, she promised to her Father in heaven; and what he  asked her to promise by word aloud, she promised loyally and eternally.    And Tom Cutts? He looked so handsome in his uniform,--and he looked like  the man he was. And in those days, the uniform, if it were only a  flannel fatigue-jacket on a private's back, was as beautiful as the  flag; nothing more beautiful than either for eyes to look upon. And  when Parson Spaulding had said the benediction, and the Amen,--and when  he had kissed Laura, with her eyes full of tears,--and when he had given  Tom Cutts joy,--then all the people came up in a double line,--and they  all kissed Laura,--and they shook hands with Tom as if they would shake  his hands off,--and in the half-reticent methods of Tripp's Cove, every  lord and lady bright that was in Moses Marvel's parlor there, said,  \"honored be the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair.\"    And there was a bunch of laurel hanging in the middle of the room, as  make-believe mistletoe. And the boys, who could not make believe even  that they were eighteen, so that they had been left at home, would catch  Phebe, and Sarah, and Mattie, and Helen, when by accident they crossed  underneath the laurel,--and would kiss them, for all their screaming.  And soon Moses Marvel brought in a waiter with wedding-cake, and Nathan  Philbrick brought in a waiter with bride-cake, and pretty Mattie Marvel  brought in a waiter with currant wine. And Tom Cutts gave every girl a  piece of wedding-cake himself, and made her promise to sleep on it. And  before they were all gone, he and Laura had been made to write names  for the girls to dream upon, that they might draw their fortunes the  next morning. And before long Moses Cutts led Mrs. Spaulding out into  the great family-room, and there was the real wedding supper. And after  they had eaten the supper, Bengel's fiddle sounded in the parlor, and  they danced, and they waltzed, and they polkaed to their hearts'  content. And so they celebrated the Christmas of 1861.    Too bad! was not it? Tom's leave was only twenty days. It took five to  come. It took five to go. After the wedding there were but seven little  days. And then he kissed dear Laura good-by,--with tears running from  his eyes and hers,--and she begged him to be sure she should be all  right, and he begged her to be certain nothing would happen to him. And  so, for near two years, they did not see each other's faces again.           *       *       *       *       *    CHRISTMAS EVE again!    Moses Marvel has driven out his own bays in his own double cutter to  meet the stage at Fordyce's. On the back seat is Mattie Marvel, with a  rosy little baby all wrapped up in furs, who has never seen his father.  Where is Laura?    \"Here she comes! here she comes!\" Sure enough! Here is the stage at  last. Job Stiles never swept round with a more knowing sweep, or better  satisfied with his precious freight at Fordyce's, than he did this  afternoon. And the curtains were up already. And there is Laura, and  there is Tom! He is pale, poor fellow. But how pleased he is! Laura is  out first, of course. And then she gives him her hand so gently, and the  others all help. And here is the hero at Marvel's side, and he is  bending over his baby, whom he does not try to lift with his one  arm,--and Mattie is crying, and I believe old Moses Marvel is  crying,--but everybody is as happy as a king, and everybody is talking  at one time,--and all the combination has turned out well.    Tom Cutts had had a hole made through his left thigh, so that they  despaired of his life. And, as he lay on the ground, a bit of a shell  had struck his left forearm and knocked that to pieces. Tom Cutts had  been sent back to hospital at Washington, and reported by telegraph as  mortally wounded. But almost as soon as Tom Cutts got to the Lincoln  Hospital himself, Laura Cutts got there too, and then Tom did not mean  to die if he could help it, and Laura did not mean to have him. And the  honest fellow held to his purpose in that steadfast Cutts way. The blood  tells, I believe. And love tells. And will tells. How much love has to  do with will! \"I believe you are a witch, Mrs. Cutts,\" the doctor used  to say to her. \"Nothing but good happens to this good-man of yours.\"  Bits of bone came out just as they were wanted to. Inflammation kept  away just as it was told to do. And the two wounds ran a race with each  other in healing after their fashion. \"It will be a beautiful stump  after all,\" said the doctor, where poor Laura saw little beauty. But  every thing was beautiful to her, when at last he told her that she  might wrap her husband up as well as she knew how, and take him home and  nurse him there. So she had telegraphed that they were coming, and that  was the way in which it happened that her father and her sister had  brought out the baby to meet them both at Fordyce's. Mattie's surprise  had worked perfectly.    And now it was time for Laura's surprise! After she had her baby in her  own arms, and was on the back seat of the sleigh; after Tom was well  wrapped up by her side, with his well arm just supporting the little  fellow's head; after Mattie was all tucked in by her father, and Mr.  Marvel himself had looked round to say, \"All ready?\" then was it that  Jem Marvel first stepped out from the stage, and said, \"Haven't you one  word for me, Mattie?\" Then how they screamed again! For everybody  thought Jem was in the West Indies. He was cruising there, on board the  \"Greywing,\" looking after blockaders who took the Southern route. Nobody  dreamed of Jem's being at Christmas. And here he had stumbled on Tom and  Laura in the New Haven train as they came on! Jem had been sent into New  York with a prize. He had got leave, and was on his way to see the rest  of them. He had bidden Laura not say one word, and so he had watched one  greeting from the stage, before he broke in to take his part for  another.    Oh! what an uproarious Christmas that was when they all came home! No!  Tom Cutts would not let one of them be sad! He was the cheeriest of them  all. He monopolized the baby, and showed immense power in the way of  baby talk and of tending. Laura had only to sit on the side of the room  and be perfectly happy. It was very soon known what the arrivals were.  And Parson Spaulding came in, and his wife. Of course the Cuttses had  been there already. Then everybody came. That is the simplest way of  putting it. They all would have wanted to come, because in that  community there was not one person who did not love Laura and Tom and  Jem. But whether they would have come, on the very first night, I am not  sure. But this was Christmas Eve, and the girls were finishing off the  meeting-house just as the stage and the sleigh came in. And, in a  minute, the news was everywhere. And, of course, everybody felt he might  just go in to get news from the fleet or the army. Nor was there one  household in Tripp's Cove which was not more or less closely represented  in the fleet or the army. So there was really, as the evening passed, a  town-meeting in Moses Marvel's sitting-room and parlor; and whether  Moses Marvel were most pleased, or Mrs. Marvel, or Laura,--who sat and  beamed,--or old General Simeon Cutts, I am sure I do not know.    That was indeed a merry Christmas!    But after that I must own it was hard sledding for Tom Cutts and for  pretty Laura. A hero with one blue sleeve pinned neatly together, who,  at the best, limps as he walks, quickens all your compassion and  gratitude;--yes! But when you are selecting a director of your lumber  works, or when you are sending to New York to buy goods, or when you are  driving a line of railway through the wilderness, I am afraid you do not  choose that hero to do your work for you. Or if you do, you were not  standing by when Tom Cutts was looking right and looking left for  something to do, so that he might keep the wolf from the door. It was  sadly like the life that his great-grandfather, Samuel Cutts, led at the  old farm in old Newbury after the old war. Tom lost his place when he  went to the front, and he could not find it again.    Laura, sweet girl, never complained. No, nor Moses Marvel. He never  complained, nor would he complain if Tom and his wife and children had  lived with him till doomsday. \"Good luck for us,\" said Moses Marvel, and  those were many words for him to say in one sentence. But Tom was proud,  and it ground him to the dust to be eating Moses Marvel's bread when he  had not earned it, and to have nothing but his major's pension to buy  Laura and the babies their clothes with, and to keep the pot a-boiling.
