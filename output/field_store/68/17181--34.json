This sentence substituted the gallows for the decapitation decreed by the  first judge, inasmuch as the latter punishment was reserved for criminals  of noble birth, while hanging was inflicted on meaner persons.              ALI PACHA  alpac10.txt or alpac10.zip [Etext #2753]    Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage.  Its  inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was  mountainous and inaccessible.  The pashas had great difficulty in  collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their  bread.  Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all  soldiers.  Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on  the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the  world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great  movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their  veins, and that war was their element.  Sometimes at feud with one  another, canton against canton, village against village, often even house  against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their sanjaks;  sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never rested from  combat except in an armed peace.  Each tribe had its military  organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on  his shoulder.  When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their  fields, or mowed their neighbours', carrying off, it should be noted, the  crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to trespass  over pasture limits.  This was the normal and regular life of the  population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania.            MURAT  murat10.txt or murat10.zip [Etext #2755]    On the 18th June, 1815, at the very moment when the destiny of Europe was  being decided at Waterloo, a man dressed like a beggar was silently  following the road from Toulon to Marseilles.    Arrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a little  eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country; then either  because he had reached the end of his journey, or because, before  attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the Thermopylae  of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which spread to the  southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on the edge of the  ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the mountains which  rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and having at his  feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation, exotics of a  conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other part of  France.

I operate only after the decision  of the Faculty.  God forbid that I should be stoned by all the  physicians, and perhaps expelled from France!\"            MARQUISE DE BRINVILLIERS  brinv10.txt or brinv10.zip [Etext #2756]    When the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before  him the executioner wiping his face.  \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"was not that  a good stroke?  I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has  always assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this  lady.  I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart.\"  He then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and  taking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in his  other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots,  which his assistant lighted.    \"The next day,\" says Madame de Sevigne, \"people were looking for the  charred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a  saint.\"            MARQUISE DE GANGES  gange10.txt or gange10.zip [Etext #2758]    The beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in  love for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have  been in love.  A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness.  The marquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she  occasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever have  believed in it.  Such happiness is not of this world, and when by chance  it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than by the  goodness of God.  Better, indeed, would it be for him who possesses and  who loses it, never to have known it.              VANINKA  vanin10.txt or vanin10.zip [Etext #2757]    About the end of the reign of the Emperor Paul I--that is to say, towards  the middle of the first year of the nineteenth century--just as four  o'clock in the afternoon was sounding from the church of St.  Peter and  St. Paul, whose gilded vane overlooks the ramparts of the fortress, a  crowd, composed of all sorts and conditions of people, began to gather in  front of a house which belonged to General Count Tchermayloff, formerly  military governor of a fair-sized town in the government of Pultava.  The  first spectators had been attracted by the preparations which they saw  had been made in the middle of the courtyard for administering torture  with the knout.  One of the general's serfs, he who acted as barber, was  to be the victim.    Although this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St.  Petersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was publicly  administered.  This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd, as just  mentioned, before General Tchermayloff's house.

To find an explanation  we must go farther afield. No one will probably deny that such a  custom savours of a barbarous age, and, surviving into imperial  times, stands out in striking isolation from the polished Italian  society of the day, like a primaeval rock rising from a  smooth-shaven lawn. It is the very rudeness and barbarity of the  custom which allow us a hope of explaining it. For recent researches  into the early history of man have revealed the essential similarity  with which, under many superficial differences, the human mind has  elaborated its first crude philosophy of life. Accordingly, if we  can show that a barbarous custom, like that of the priesthood of  Nemi, has existed elsewhere; if we can detect the motives which led  to its institution; if we can prove that these motives have operated  widely, perhaps universally, in human society, producing in varied  circumstances a variety of institutions specifically different but  generically alike; if we can show, lastly, that these very motives,  with some of their derivative institutions, were actually at work in  classical antiquity; then we may fairly infer that at a remoter age  the same motives gave birth to the priesthood of Nemi. Such an  inference, in default of direct evidence as to how the priesthood  did actually arise, can never amount to demonstration. But it will  be more or less probable according to the degree of completeness  with which it fulfils the conditions I have indicated. The object of  this book is, by meeting these conditions, to offer a fairly  probable explanation of the priesthood of Nemi.    I begin by setting forth the few facts and legends which have come  down to us on the subject. According to one story the worship of  Diana at Nemi was instituted by Orestes, who, after killing Thoas,  King of the Tauric Chersonese (the Crimea), fled with his sister to  Italy, bringing with him the image of the Tauric Diana hidden in a  faggot of sticks. After his death his bones were transported from  Aricia to Rome and buried in front of the temple of Saturn, on the  Capitoline slope, beside the temple of Concord. The bloody ritual  which legend ascribed to the Tauric Diana is familiar to classical  readers; it is said that every stranger who landed on the shore was  sacrificed on her altar. But transported to Italy, the rite assumed  a milder form. Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of  which no branch might be broken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to  break off, if he could, one of its boughs. Success in the attempt  entitled him to fight the priest in single combat, and if he slew  him he reigned in his stead with the title of King of the Wood (_Rex  Nemorensis_). According to the public opinion of the ancients the  fateful branch was that Golden Bough which, at the Sibyl's bidding,  Aeneas plucked before he essayed the perilous journey to the world  of the dead. The flight of the slave represented, it was said, the  flight of Orestes; his combat with the priest was a reminiscence of  the human sacrifices once offered to the Tauric Diana. This rule of  succession by the sword was observed down to imperial times; for  amongst his other freaks Caligula, thinking that the priest of Nemi  had held office too long, hired a more stalwart ruffian to slay him;  and a Greek traveller, who visited Italy in the age of the  Antonines, remarks that down to his time the priesthood was still  the prize of victory in a single combat.    Of the worship of Diana at Nemi some leading features can still be  made out. From the votive offerings which have been found on the  site, it appears that she was conceived of especially as a huntress,  and further as blessing men and women with offspring, and granting  expectant mothers an easy delivery. Again, fire seems to have played  a foremost part in her ritual. For during her annual festival, held  on the thirteenth of August, at the hottest time of the year, her  grove shone with a multitude of torches, whose ruddy glare was  reflected by the lake; and throughout the length and breadth of  Italy the day was kept with holy rites at every domestic hearth.  Bronze statuettes found in her precinct represent the goddess  herself holding a torch in her raised right hand; and women whose  prayers had been heard by her came crowned with wreaths and bearing  lighted torches to the sanctuary in fulfilment of their vows. Some  one unknown dedicated a perpetually burning lamp in a little shrine  at Nemi for the safety of the Emperor Claudius and his family. The  terra-cotta lamps which have been discovered in the grove may  perhaps have served a like purpose for humbler persons. If so, the  analogy of the custom to the Catholic practice of dedicating holy  candles in churches would be obvious. Further, the title of Vesta  borne by Diana at Nemi points clearly to the maintenance of a  perpetual holy fire in her sanctuary. A large circular basement at  the north-east corner of the temple, raised on three steps and  bearing traces of a mosaic pavement, probably supported a round  temple of Diana in her character of Vesta, like the round temple of  Vesta in the Roman Forum. Here the sacred fire would seem to have  been tended by Vestal Virgins, for the head of a Vestal in  terra-cotta was found on the spot, and the worship of a perpetual  fire, cared for by holy maidens, appears to have been common in  Latium from the earliest to the latest times. Further, at the annual  festival of the goddess, hunting dogs were crowned and wild beasts  were not molested; young people went through a purificatory ceremony  in her honour; wine was brought forth, and the feast consisted of a  kid cakes served piping hot on plates of leaves, and apples still  hanging in clusters on the boughs.    But Diana did not reign alone in her grove at Nemi. Two lesser  divinities shared her forest sanctuary. One was Egeria, the nymph of  the clear water which, bubbling from the basaltic rocks, used to  fall in graceful cascades into the lake at the place called Le Mole,  because here were established the mills of the modern village of  Nemi. The purling of the stream as it ran over the pebbles is  mentioned by Ovid, who tells us that he had often drunk of its  water. Women with child used to sacrifice to Egeria, because she was  believed, like Diana, to be able to grant them an easy delivery.  Tradition ran that the nymph had been the wife or mistress of the  wise king Numa, that he had consorted with her in the secrecy of the  sacred grove, and that the laws which he gave the Romans had been  inspired by communion with her divinity. Plutarch compares the  legend with other tales of the loves of goddesses for mortal men,  such as the love of Cybele and the Moon for the fair youths Attis  and Endymion. According to some, the trysting-place of the lovers  was not in the woods of Nemi but in a grove outside the dripping  Porta Capena at Rome, where another sacred spring of Egeria gushed  from a dark cavern. Every day the Roman Vestals fetched water from  this spring to wash the temple of Vesta, carrying it in earthenware  pitchers on their heads. In Juvenal's time the natural rock had been  encased in marble, and the hallowed spot was profaned by gangs of  poor Jews, who were suffered to squat, like gypsies, in the grove.  We may suppose that the spring which fell into the lake of Nemi was  the true original Egeria, and that when the first settlers moved  down from the Alban hills to the banks of the Tiber they brought the  nymph with them and found a new home for her in a grove outside the  gates. The remains of baths which have been discovered within the  sacred precinct, together with many terra-cotta models of various  parts of the human body, suggest that the waters of Egeria were used  to heal the sick, who may have signified their hopes or testified  their gratitude by dedicating likenesses of the diseased members to  the goddess, in accordance with a custom which is still observed in  many parts of Europe. To this day it would seem that the spring  retains medicinal virtues.    The other of the minor deities at Nemi was Virbius. Legend had it  that Virbius was the young Greek hero Hippolytus, chaste and fair,  who learned the art of venery from the centaur Chiron, and spent all  his days in the greenwood chasing wild beasts with the virgin  huntress Artemis (the Greek counterpart of Diana) for his only  comrade. Proud of her divine society, he spurned the love of women,  and this proved his bane. For Aphrodite, stung by his scorn,  inspired his stepmother Phaedra with love of him; and when he  disdained her wicked advances she falsely accused him to his father  Theseus. The slander was believed, and Theseus prayed to his sire  Poseidon to avenge the imagined wrong. So while Hippolytus drove in  a chariot by the shore of the Saronic Gulf, the sea-god sent a  fierce bull forth from the waves. The terrified horses bolted, threw  Hippolytus from the chariot, and dragged him at their hoofs to  death. But Diana, for the love she bore Hippolytus, persuaded the  leech Aesculapius to bring her fair young hunter back to life by his  simples. Jupiter, indignant that a mortal man should return from the  gates of death, thrust down the meddling leech himself to Hades. But  Diana hid her favourite from the angry god in a thick cloud,  disguised his features by adding years to his life, and then bore  him far away to the dells of Nemi, where she entrusted him to the  nymph Egeria, to live there, unknown and solitary, under the name of  Virbius, in the depth of the Italian forest. There he reigned a  king, and there he dedicated a precinct to Diana. He had a comely  son, Virbius, who, undaunted by his father's fate, drove a team of  fiery steeds to join the Latins in the war against Aeneas and the  Trojans. Virbius was worshipped as a god not only at Nemi but  elsewhere; for in Campania we hear of a special priest"]]]
