CHAPTER I.         THE OBJECT OF OUR EXPEDITION--A GLIMPSE OF ALASKA THROUGH CAPTAIN       WALRUS' GLASS--WE ARE TEMPTED BY OUR RECENT PURCHASE--ALASKAN GAME       OF \"OLD SLEDGE\"--THE EARLY STRUGGLES OF KANSAS--THE SMOKY HILL       TRAIL--INDIAN HIGH ART--THE \"BORDER-RUFFIAN,\" PAST AND       PRESENT--TOPEKA--HOW IT RECEIVED ITS NAME--WAUKARUSA AND ITS       LEGEND.      The great plains--the region of country in which our expedition  sojourned for so many months--is wilder, and by far more interesting,  than those solitudes over which the Egyptian Sphynx looks out. The  latter are barren and desolate, while the former teem with their savage  races and scarcely more savage beasts. The very soil which these tread  is written all over with a history of the past, even its surface giving  to science wonderful and countless fossils of those ages when the world  was young and man not yet born.    At first, it was rather unsettled which way the steps of our party would  turn; between unexplored territory and that newly acquired, there were  several fields open which promised much of interest. Originally, our  company numbered a dozen; but Alaska tempted a portion of our savans,  and to the fishy and frigid maiden they yielded, drawn by a strange  predilection for train-oil and seal meat toward the land of furs. For  the remainder of our party, however, life under the Alaskan's tent-pole  had no charms. Our decision may have been influenced somewhat by the  seafaring man with whom our friends were to sail. The real name of this  son of Neptune was Samuels, but our party called him, as it savored more  of salt water, Captain Walrus, of the bark Harpoon. This worthy,  according to his own statement, had been born on a whaler, weaned among  the Esquimeaux, and, moreover, had frozen off eight toes \"trying to  winter it at our recent purchase.\" He evidently disliked to have  scientific men aboard, intent on studying eclipses and seals. \"A  heathenish and strange people are the Alaskans,\" Walrus was wont to say.  \"What is not Indian is Russian, and a compound of the latter and  aboriginal is a mixture most villainous. One portion of the partnership  anatomy takes to brandy, while the other absorbs train-oil, and so a  half-breed Alaskan heathen is always prepared for spontaneous  combustion, and if rubbed the wrong way, flames up instantly. He is  always hot for murder, and if you throw cold water on his designs, his  oily nature sheds it.\"    And many a yarn did the captain spin concerning their strange customs.  Sealing a marriage contract consisted in the warrior leaving a fat seal  at the hole of the hut, where his intended crawled in to her home  privileges of smoke and fish. Their favorite game was \"old sledge,\"  played with prisoners to shorten their captivity.    [Illustration: ALASKAN LOVERS--SEALING THE CONTRACT.]    [Illustration: ALASKAN GAME OF OLD SLEDGE.]    All this, and much more, probably equally true, we had picked up of  Alaskan history, and at one time our chests had been packed for a voyage  on the Harpoon; but at the final council the west carried it against  the north, and our steps were directed toward the setting sun, instead  of the polar star.    The expedition afforded unexcelled facilities for seeing Buffalo Land.  It was composed of good material, and pursued its chosen path  successfully, though under difficulties which would have turned back a  less determined party.    None of our company, I trust, will consider it an unwarrantable license  which recounts to others the personal peculiarities and mistakes about  which we joked so freely while in camp. It was generally understood,  before we parted, that the adventures should be common stock for our  children and children's children. Why should not the great public share  in it also?           *       *       *       *       *    Let the reader place before him a checker-board, and allow it to  represent Kansas, whose shape and outline it much resembles; the half  nearest him will stand for the eastern or settled portion of the State,  of which the other half is embraced in Buffalo Land proper. It is with  the latter that we have first to do, as with it we first became  acquainted.    Our party entered the State at Kansas City, and took the cars for  Topeka, its capital. During our morning ride through the valley of the  Kaw, memory went backward to the years when \"Bleeding Kansas\" was the  signal-cry of emancipation. When gray old Time, a decade and a half ago,  was writing the history of those bright children of Freedom, the united  sisterhood, a virgin arm reached over his shoulder, and a fair young  hand, stained with its own life-blood, wrote on the page toward which  all the world was gazing, \"I am Kansas, latest-born of America. I would  be free, yet they would make me a slave. Save me, my sisters!\" The great  heart of our nation was sorely distressed. Conscience pointed to one  path--Policy, that rank hypocrite, to another.    And so it was that the young queen, with her grand domain in the West,  struggled forward to lay her fealty at the feet of our great mother,  Liberty. She made a body-guard of her own sons, and their number was  quickly swelled by brave hearts from the north, east, and west. The new  territory, begging admission as a State, became a battle-ground. Slavery  had reached forth its hand to grasp the new State and fresh soil, but  the mutilated member was drawn back with wounds which soon reached,  corrupted and destroyed the body. In this land of the Far West a nation  of young giants had been suddenly developed, and Kansas was forever won  for freedom.    But there was yet another enemy and another danger. Westward, toward  Colorado, the savage's tomahawk and knife glittered, and struck among  the affrighted settlements. _Ad Astra per Aspera_, \"to the stars through  difficulties,\" the State exclaims on the seal, and to the stars, through  blood, its course has been.    Those old pages of history are too bloody to be brought to light in the  bright present, and we purpose turning them only enough to gather what  will be now of practical use. Kansas suffered cruelly, and brooded over  her wrongs, but she has long since struck hands with her bitterer foe.  Most of the \"Border Ruffians\" ripened on gallows trees, or fell by the  sword, years ago. A few, however, are yet spared, to cheer their old age  by riding around in desolate woods at midnight, wrapped in damp  nightgowns, and masked in grinning death-heads. Although the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#3)"],[1,"masonry. The main building was certainly erected quite a  century earlier. Here and there modern windows have been inserted in  place of the Tudor mullioned ones, as also have later doorways, for part  of the building is now occupied as tenements. The archway leading into  the courtyard has also been somewhat modernised, as may be judged from  the corresponding internal arch, with its original curved dripstone  above.    We came upon this inn, tramping northwards in a bitter day in March.  It looked homely and inviting, the waning sunlight tinting the stonework  and lighting up the window casements. Enthusiastic with pleasing  imaginings of panelled chambers and ghostly echoing corridors, we  entered only to have our dreams speedily dispersed. In vain we sought  for such a \"best room\" as greeted Mr. Chester at the \"Maypole.\" There  were no rich rustling hangings here, nor oaken screens enriched with  grotesque carvings. Alas! not even a cheery fire of fagots. Nor, indeed,  was there a bed to rest our weary bones upon. Spring cleaning was  rampant, and the merciless east wind sweeping along the bare passages  made one shudder more than usual at the thought of that terrible annual  necessity (but the glory of energetic house-wives). But surely mine  hostess of the good old days would have scrupled to thrust the traveller  from her door: moreover to a house of refreshment, or rather  eating-house, a stone's-throw off, uncomfortably near that rickety  propped-up red-brick residence.    With visions of the smoking bowl and lavender-scented sheets dashed to  the ground, we turned away. But, lo! and behold a good _angel_ had come  to the rescue. So absorbed had we been with the possibilities of the  \"Bell\" that the \"Angel\" opposite had quite been overlooked. This rival  inn of Georgian date furnished us with cosy quarters. From our  flower-bedecked window the whole front of the old \"Bell\" could be  leisurely studied in all its varying stages of light and shade--an inn  with a past; an object-lesson for the philosopher to ruminate upon. Yes,  in its day one can picture scenes of lavish, shall we say Ainsworthian  hospitality. There is a smack of huge venison pasties, fatted capons,  and of roasted peacocks about this hoary hostel. And its stables; one  has but to stroll up an adjacent lane to get some idea of the once vast  extent of its outbuildings. The ground they covered must have occupied  nearly half the village. Here was stabling for over eighty horses, and  before the birth of trains, thirty-six coaches pulled up daily at the  portal for hungry passengers to refresh or rest.    The famous cheese, by the way, was first sold at this inn; but why it  was dubbed Stilton instead of Dalby in Leicestershire, where it was  first manufactured, is a mystery. Like its _vis-a-vis_, the \"Angel\" is  far different from what it was in its flourishing days. The main  building is now occupied for other purposes, and its dignity has long  since departed. To-day Stilton looks on its last legs. The goggled  motor-fiend sweeps by to Huntingdon or Peterborough while Stilton rubs  its sleepy eyes. But who can tell but that its fortunes may yet revive.  Was not Broadway dying a natural death when Jonathan, who invariably  tells us what treasures we possess, stepped in and made it popular? Some  enterprising landlord might do worse than take the old \"Bell\" in hand  and ring it to a profitable tune. But judging by appearances, visitors  to-day, at least in March, are few and far between.    Half the charm of Stilton lies in the fact that there is no hurry. It is  quite refreshing in these days of rush. For instance, you want to catch  a train at Peterborough,--at least we did, for that was the handiest way  of reaching Oundle, some seven miles to the west of Stilton as the crow  flies. Sitting on thorns, we awaited the convenience of the horse as to  whether his accustomed jog-trot would enable us to catch our train. We  _did_ catch it truly, but the anxiety was a terrible experience.    Oundle is full of old inns. The \"Turk's Head,\" facing the church, is a  fine and compact specimen of Jacobean architecture. It was a brilliant  morning when we stood in the churchyard looking up at the  ball-surmounted gables standing out in bold relief against the clear  blue sky, while the caw of a colony of rooks sailing overhead seemed  quite in harmony with the old-world surroundings.    More important and flourishing is the \"Talbot,\" which looks  self-conscious of the fact that in its walls are incorporated some of  the remains of no less historic a building than Fotheringay Castle,  whose moat and fragmentary walls are to be seen some three and a half  miles to the north of the town. The fortress, with its sad and tragic  memories of Mary Queen of Scots, was demolished after James came to the  throne, and its fine oak staircase, by repute the same by which she  descended to the scaffold, was re-erected in the \"Talbot.\" The courtyard  is picturesque. The old windows which light the staircase, which also  are said to have come from Fotheringay, are angular at the base, and  have an odd and pleasing appearance.    Two ancient almshouses, with imposing entrance gates, are well worth  inspection. There is a graceful little pinnacle surmounting one of the  gable ends, at which we were curiously gazing when one of the aged  inmates came out in alarm to see if the chimney was on fire.    Fotheringay church, with its lantern tower and flying buttresses, is  picturesquely situated close to the river Nene, and with the bridge  makes a charming picture. The older bridge of Queen Mary's time was  angular, with square arches, as may be seen from a print of the early  part of the eighteenth century. In this is shown the same scanty remains  of the historic Castle: a wall with a couple of Gothic doorways, all  that survived of the formidable fortress that was the unfortunate  queen's last prison-house. As at Cumnor, where poor Amy Robsart was  done to death in a manner which certainly Elizabeth hinted at regarding  her troublesome cousin, there is little beyond the foundations from  which to form an idea of the building. It was divided by a double moat,  which is still to be seen, as well as the natural earthwork upon which  the keep stood. The queen's apartments, that towards the end were  stripped of all emblems of royalty, were situated above and to the south  of the great hall, into which she had to descend by a staircase to the  scaffold. Some ancient thorn trees now flourish upon the spot. The  historian Fuller, who visited the castle prior to its demolition, found  the following lines from an old ballad scratched with a diamond upon a  window-pane of Mary's prison-chamber:      \"From the top of all my trust    Mishap hath laid me in the dust.\"    Though Mary's mock trial took place at Fotheringay in the \"Presence  Chamber,\" she was actually condemned in the Star Chamber at Westminster;  and it may here be stated that that fine old room may yet be seen not  very many miles away, at Wormleighton, near the Northamptonshire border  of south-east Warwickshire. A farmhouse near Fotheringay is still  pointed out where the executioner lodged the night before the deed; and  some claim this distinction for the ancient inn in which are  incorporated some remains of the castle.    As is known, the Queen of Scots' body was buried first in Peterborough  Cathedral, whence it was removed to Westminster Abbey. There is a  superstition in Northamptonshire that if a body after interment be  removed, it bodes misfortune to the surviving members of the family.  This was pointed out at the time to James I.; but superstitious as he  was, he did not alter his plans, and the death of Prince Henry shortly  afterwards seemed to confirm this belief.[4]    But there are other memories of famous names in history, for the head of  the White Rose family, Richard of York, was buried in the church, and  his duchess, Cecilia Neville, as well as Edward of York, whose death at  Agincourt is immortalised by Shakespeare. When the older church was  dismantled and the bodies removed to their present destination, a silver  ribbon was discovered round the Duchess Cecilia's neck upon which a  pardon from Rome was clearly written. The windows of the church once  were rich in painted glass; and at the fine fifteenth-century font it is  conjectured Richard III. was baptized, for he was born at the Castle.  Crookback's badge, the boar, may still be seen in the church, and the  Yorkist falcon and fetterlock are displayed on the summit of the vane  upon the tower. Also some carved stalls, which came from here, in the  churches of Tansor and Hemington to the south of Fotheringay, bear the  regal badges and crest. The falcon and the fetterlock also occur in the  monuments to the Dukes of York, which were rebuilt by Queen Elizabeth  when the older tombs had fallen to decay. The allegiance to the  fascinating Queen of Scots is far from dead, for in February 1902, and  doubtless more recently, a gentleman journeyed specially from Edinburgh  to Fotheringay to place a tribute to her martyrdom in the form of a  large cross of immortelles bearing the Scots crown and Mary's monogram,  and a black bordered white silk sash attached.    A few miles to the west of this historic spot are the fine Tudor houses  Deene and Kirby: the former still a palatial residence; the latter,  alas! a ruin fast falling to decay. Deene, with its battlemented towers  and turrets and buttressed walls, is a noble-looking structure, with  numerous shields of arms and heraldic devices carved upon the masonry.  These are of the great families, Brudenel, Montagu, Bruce, Bulstrode,  etc., whose intermarriages are emblazoned in painted glass in the top of  the mullioned windows of the hall. Sir Thomas Brudenel, the first Earl  of Cardigan, who died three years after the Restoration, was a typical  old cavalier after the style of Sir "]]]
