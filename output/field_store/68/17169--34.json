This was owing to the general prevalence of sectarian principles,  divisions, precepts, commandments, and doctrines of men, by which the  Law and the Prophets were made void, and a veil was thrown over them,  or over the hearts of men, by which means they were misunderstood, or  rather, not understood at all.    It therefore became the duty of Jesus Christ and his Apostles and  Elders, as well as of his forerunner, to reprove those sects, denounce  their doctrines and traditions, and restore that which was lost in  this great science.    This restoration was at first confined strictly to the nation of the  Jews. But seeing they turned from it, and judged themselves unworthy  of eternal life, preferring their own powerless forms and doctrines,  to the science of revelation, miracles, visions, and prophecy, which  had ever illuminated the pathway of their more ancient fathers, the  Apostles turned from them, by the commandment of the Lord, and  translated this science, with its keys and legitimate powers, to the  Gentiles.    The nation had rejected and slain the Messiah, stoned the Prophets,  and imprisoned and even murdered many of the Apostles and Elders; and  Jesus had already, in tears of anguish, announced their doom--    \"_O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest  them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy  children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her  wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  For I say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say,  Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord_.\"    Again, on another occasion, the Messiah uttered his voice,  saying--\"_There shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon  this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall  be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden  down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled_.\"    Again he spake, concerning the Temple, saying--\"_There shall net be  left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down_.\"    All these things, foretold by the science of Theology, were fulfilled  in that generation. And Jerusalem has been destroyed, trodden down by  the Gentiles, and the Jews have remained in captivity among the  nations until now.    Our readers will readily discern the entire loss of the science and  powers of Theology among this nation; the time, circumstances, and  reasons of its decline; and the time or circumstances which will  restore it unto them.    They lost it when, by the hand of the Apostles, it was taken from them  and given to the Gentiles.    The result was, the destruction of their city and temple, and of their  national existence.    Their temple, priesthood, and offerings were no longer attended by  divine power. Its outward forms were, therefore, of no possible use.    From that very time to the present--One thousand eight hundred and  fifty-one of the Christian era, the voice of a Prophet has not been  heard among the Jews.    Angels have not ministered unto them.    There has been no vision from the Lord.    No dream or interpretation.    No answer by Urim or Thummim.    No Prophet.    No voice.    No sound.    No reproof.    No comforting whisper.    All is silence--stillness--solemn blackness of despair.    All is as the similitude and shadow of death.    Oh the weariness, the painful suspense, the watchings, the wanderings,  the anxieties, the pains and sorrows of eighteen centuries! Oh the  mist of ages which has shrouded a nation as it were in the gloom of an  endless night!    When--O when, will their day dawn, and the day star of their ancient  science appear above the horizon, disperse the cloud, and usher in the  morning of a brighter day?    _When the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled_.    When they shall welcome a messenger in the name of the Lord.          CHAPTER III.    PROGRESS, DECLINE, AND FINAL LOSS OF THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY AMONG THE  GENTILES--FORESHADOWINGS OF ITS RESTORATION FOR THE USHERING IN OF THE  MILLENNIUM.          Oh Mystic Babel, long has been thy reign!      What direful evils follow in thy train!      The veil is rent--thy mystery revealed,      Angels cry wo! and God thy doom has sealed.      The nations, from thy long and dreary night,      Are waking now to everlasting light.    Returning to the Gentile Church, we find the science of Theology, with  all its miraculous powers of visions, dreams, angels, revelations,  prophecy, healings, &c., everywhere enjoyed. It had abated none of its  powers, in its transition from Jew to Gentile. The wild branches,  being engrafted into the good old stock, immediately partook of the  root and fatness of the tame olive tree, and thus was produced the  natural fruit.    But Paul, the great Apostle of the Gentiles, in his writings to the  Romans, cautioned them to beware lest they should fall away after the  same example as the Jews had done before them.    Said he--\"_If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he  also spare not thee_.\"    John the Apostle also predicted the rise and universal sway of a  certain mystical power, a Babel of spiritual or religious confusion,  in short--\"_Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and  abominations of the earth_.\"    This power should bear rule among all nations. The kings and rulers of  the earth should be drunken with the wine of her fornication. The  merchants of the earth should become rich through the abundance of her  delicacies.    This power should, according to the Prophet Daniel and the Apostle  John, \"_wear out the Saints of the Most High_;\" \"_change times and  laws_;\" \"_be drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood  of the martyrs of Jesus_;\" \"_destroy the mighty and the holy people_;\"  \"_make war with the Saints, and overcome them_\" until a set time.    All these predictions, and many others, foretell the doom of the  Gentile Church--its destruction from the earth, and the consequent  decline and cessation of the science of Theology, and of its powers  and blessings in the Gentile world.    Connected with these predictions, we have the most positive prophetic  declarations of Holy Writ concerning the overthrow and entire  destruction of this same mystical power, which had made war with the  Saints.    Its judgments are set forth as far more terrible than those which  befell Jerusalem. Plague, pestilence, sword, earthquake, and the flame  of devouring fire will cause her to cease to be.    Then will usher in the kingdom of our God, and the power of His  Christ. Then will the Saints of the Most High take the kingdom, and  the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven.    Thus are to be revived the ancient powers and blessings, the knowledge  and wisdom, of the science of Theology.    In the fulfilment of the foregoing predictions, the science of  Theology declined, and passed away from among the Gentiles, just in  proportion as the Church, or the Saints of the Most High, were warred  against and overcome.    For years, centuries, ages, there has been no voice from heaven among  the Gentiles, any more than among the Jews. They have fallen \"_after  the same example of unbelief_,\" notwithstanding the caution of their  great Apostle.    No Gentile Prophet has arisen and uttered his voice.    No kind angel has ministered to them.    No vision from the Lord.    No answer.    No inspired dream.    No voice.    No sound from the heavens.    No revelation has burst upon the silence of midnight darkness which  has brooded over the nations.    Or, if such voice, such vision, such Prophet has occasionally burst  forth with the testimony of Jesus, the spirit of prophecy, his  testimony has been unheeded by the mass of the people called  Christians, his voice silenced in death, or himself and his followers  have been banished from society, to wander in the mountains, forests,  caves, or deserts of the earth; or, on the other hand, compelled to  drag out an existence in the solitude of the dungeon.    Ages, centuries have passed, and Oh! what suffering! what torture!  what rivers of tears! what oceans of blood! what groanings! what  strong crying and tears on the earth! what prayers in heaven!    \"How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our  blood, on them that dwell on the earth?\"    The fire consumed.    The sword devoured.    Hell's artillery bellowed.    Devils hugely grinned.    Widows and orphans mourned.    Heaven wept.    Saints prayed.    Justice stood aghast.    Mercy, retiring, dropped a tear of blood.    Angels, starting, half-drew their glittering swords.    And the Gods, in solemn council, decreed a just vengeance.    Protest upon protest! reforms and re-reforms; revolutions, struggles,  exertions of every kind, of mere human invention, have been tried, and  tried in vain. The science of Theology, with all its keys and powers,  once lost, could never, consistent with the ancient Prophetic  testimony, be restored to either Jew or Gentile, until the full time  should arrive--\"_The times of restitution of all things, which God  hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world  began_.\"    The time for _a mighty angel to fly in the midst of heaven, having the  everlasting Gospel to preach to them who dwell on the earth; to every  nation, kindred, tongue, and people_. (See John's revelation.)    The time of judgment for \"_Mystery Babylon_.\"    The times of \"_the fulness of the Gentiles_.\"    The times for the grafting in again of the Jews, and all the natural  branches of Israel.    Then, and not till then, could the science, the keys, the powers of  Theology, be restored to man.    No individual or combined human action could obtain or restore again  these keys--this science.    A mighty angel held the keys of this science for the last days.

(#3)"],[1,"complex life, their  association in fixed or floating communities, their wonderful  processes of development uniting the most dissimilar individuals in  one and the same cycle of growth, their study should have become one  of the most fascinating pursuits of modern science, and have engaged  the attention of some of the most original investigators during the  last half century. It is true that from the earliest days of Natural  History, the more conspicuous and easily accessible of these animals  attracted notice and found their way into the scientific works of the  time. Even Aristotle describes some of them under the names of  Acalephae and Knidae, and later observers have added something, here and  there, to our knowledge on the subject; but it is only within the last  fifty years that their complicated history has been unravelled, and  the facts concerning them presented in their true connection.    Among the earlier writers on this subject we are most indebted to  Rondelet, in the sixteenth century, who includes some account of the  Radiates, in his work on the marine animals of the Mediterranean. His  position as Professor in the University at Montpelier gave him an  admirable opportunity, of which he availed himself to the utmost, for  carrying out his investigations in this direction. Seba and Klein, two  naturalists in the North of Europe, also published at about this time  numerous illustrations of marine animals, including Radiates. But in  all these works we find only drawings and descriptions of the animals,  without any attempt to classify them according to common structural  features. In 1776, O. F. Mueller, in a work on the marine and  terrestrial faunae of Denmark, gave some admirable figures of Radiates,  several of which are identical with those found on our own coast.  Cavolini also in his investigations on the lower marine animals of the  Mediterranean, and Ellis in his work upon those of the British coast,  did much during the latter half of the past century to enlarge our  knowledge of them.    It was Cuvier, however, who first gave coherence and precision to all  previous investigations upon this subject, by showing that these  animals are united on a common plan of structure expressively  designated by him under the name Radiata. Although, from a mistaken  appreciation of their affinities, he associated some animals with them  which do not belong to the type, and have since, upon a more intimate  knowledge of their structure, been removed to their true positions;  yet the principle introduced by him into their classification, as well  as into that of the other types of the animal kingdom, has been all  important to science.    It was in the early part of this century that the French began to  associate scientific objects with their government expeditions.  Scarcely any important voyage was undertaken to foreign countries by  the French navy which did not include its corps of naturalists, under  the patronage of government. Among the most beautiful figures we have  of Radiates, are those made by Savigny, one of the French naturalists  who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt; and from this time the lower marine  animals began to be extensively collected and studied in their living  condition. Henceforth the number of investigators in the field became  more numerous, and it may not be amiss to give here a slight account  of the more prominent among them.    Darwin's fascinating book, published after his voyage to the Pacific,  and giving an account of the Coral islands, the many memoirs of Milne  Edwards and Haime, and the great works of Quoy and Gaimard, and of  Dana, are the chief authorities upon Polyps. In the study of the  European Acalephs we have a long list of names high in the annals of  science. Eschscholtz, Peron and Lesueur, Quoy and Gaimard, Lesson,  Mertens, and Huxley, have all added largely to our information  respecting these animals, their various voyages having enabled them to  extend their investigations over a wide field. No less valuable have  been the memoirs of Koelliker, Leuckart, Gegenbaur, Vogt, and Haeckel,  who in their frequent excursions to the coasts of Italy and France  have made a special study of the Acalephs, and whose descriptions have  all the vividness and freshness which nothing but familiarity with the  living specimens can give. Besides these, we have the admirable works  of Von Siebold, of Ehrenberg, the great interpreter of the microscopic  world, of Steenstrup, Dujardin, Dalyell, Forbes, Allman, and Sars. Of  these, the four latter were fortunate in having their home on the  sea-shore within reach of the objects of their study, so that they  could watch them in their living condition, and follow all their  changes. The charming books of Forbes, who knew so well how to  popularize his instructions, and present scientific results under the  most attractive form, are well known to English readers. But a word on  the investigations of Sars may not be superfluous.    Born near the coast of Norway, and in early life associated with the  Church, his passion for Natural History led him to employ all his  spare time in the study of the marine animals immediately about him,  and his first papers on this subject attracted so much attention, that  he was offered the place of Professor at Christiania, and henceforth  devoted himself exclusively to scientific pursuits, and especially to  the investigation of the Acalephs. He gave us the key to the almost  fabulous transformations of these animals, and opened a new path in  science by showing the singular phenomenon of the so-called \"alternate  generations,\" in which the different phases of the same life may be so  distinct and seemingly so disconnected that, until we find the  relation between them, we seem to have several animals where we have  but one.    To the works above mentioned, we may add the third and fourth volumes  of Professor Agassiz's Contributions to the Natural History of the  United States, which are entirely devoted to the American Acalephs.    The most important works and memoirs concerning the Echinoderms are  those by Klein, Link, Johannes Mueller, Jaeger, Desmoulins, Troschel,  Sars, Savigny, Forbes, Agassiz, and Luetken, but excepting those of  Forbes and Sars, few of these observations are made upon the living  specimens. It may be well to mention here, for the benefit of those  who care to know something more of the literature of this subject in  our own country, a number of memoirs on the Radiates of our coasts,  published by the various scientific societies of the United States,  and to be found in their annals. Such are the papers of Gould,  Agassiz, Leidy, Stimpson, Ayres, McCrady, Clark, A. Agassiz, and  Verrill.    One additional word as to the manner in which the subjects included in  the following descriptions are arranged. We have seen that Cuvier  recognized the unity of plan in the structure of the whole type of  Radiates. All these animals have their parts disposed around a common  central axis, and diverging from it toward the periphery. The idea of  bilateral symmetry, or the arrangement of parts on either side of a  longitudinal axis, on which all the higher animals are built, does not  enter into their structure, except in a very subordinate manner,  hardly to be perceived by any but the professional naturalist. This  radiate structure being then common to the whole type, the animals  composing it appear under three distinct structural expressions of the  general plan, and according to these differences are divided into  three classes,--Polyps, Acalephs, and Echinoderms. With these few  preliminary remarks we may now take up in turn these different groups,  beginning with the lowest, or the Polyps.[1]    [Footnote 1: It is to be regretted that on account of the meagre  representations of Polyps on our coast, where the coral reefs, which  include the most interesting features of Polyp life, are entirely  wanting, our account of these animals is necessarily deficient in  variety of material. When we reach the Acalephs or Jelly-Fishes, in  which the fauna of our shores is especially rich, we shall not have the  same apology for dulness; and it will be our own fault if our readers  are not attracted by the many graceful forms to which we shall then  introduce them.]           *       *       *       *       *          GENERAL SKETCH OF THE POLYPS.    Before describing the different kinds of Polyps living on our  immediate coast, we will say a few words of Polyps in general and of  the mode in which the structural plan common to all Radiates is  adapted to this particular class. In all Polyps the body consists of a  sac divided by vertical partitions (Fig. 1.) into distinct cavities or  chambers. These partitions are not, however, all formed at once, but  are usually limited to six at first, multiplying indefinitely with the  growth of the animal in some kinds, while in others they never  increase beyond a certain definite number. In the axis of the sac,  thus divided, hangs a smaller one, forming the digestive cavity, and  supported for its whole length by the six primary partitions. The  other partitions, though they extend more or less inward in proportion  to their age, do not unite with the digestive sac, but leave a free  space in the centre between their inner edge and the outer wall of the  digestive sac. The genital organs are placed on the inner edges of the  partitions, thus hanging as it were at the door of the chambers, so  that when hatched, the eggs naturally drop into the main cavity of the  body, whence they pass into the second smaller sac through an opening  in its bottom or digestive cavity, and thence out through the mouth  into the water. In the lower Polyps, as in our common Actinia for  instance, these organs occur on all the radiating partitions, while  among the higher ones, the Halcyonoids for example, they are found  only on a limited number.
