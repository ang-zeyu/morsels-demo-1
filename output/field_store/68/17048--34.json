It must be remembered that the flavor is the very life of the candy.  Color may please the eye, but excellence in that alone is not all that  is required. A buyer may be attracted by the eye, but he does not eat  with it. Neither old or young would knowingly eat only colored sugar. A  sweet taste may be satisfied with sugar alone.    It is the variety of pleasant flavors that is desired and it is the  business of the confectioner to supply it. Flavors for sugar boiling  should be as concentrated as it is possible for it to be. Several large  houses who have confined their attention to the wants and requirements  of the confectionery and mineral water trades have succeeded in  producing fruit essences of quality, which is a pleasure to work with.  Being very powerful, little is required to give the boil rich flavor,  consequently it passes through the machine easily, forming a perfect  drop on which the clear imprint of the engraving characteristic of the  machine used. Essential oils used by confectioners are those having an  agreeable aromatic flavor, and should be used in their original  strength, without being adulterated or reduced. It is absolutely  necessary that they should be pure and fresh, more particularly the oils  of lemon and orange, as when not fresh and pure they partake of the  flavor of turpentine, and are particularly unpleasant to the taste.    Small makers would do well to buy carefully from a good house not more  than would be used up in two or three months, especially the two before  mentioned. Some oils on the contrary, improve by keeping such as  peppermint and lavender. All essences and oils are best kept well corked  in a cool dark place.    These oils being powerful, popular and expensive, they are frequently  adulterated. Cream of tartar and tartaric acid on account of the price  is often increased, the former with different cheap powders, the latter  usually with alum. Many people fail in the process through no fault of  their own, but simply through their being supplied with inferior  ingredients, it is therefore of importance, that colors and flavors  should be purchased at some respectable house; get list of oils'  extracts and essences from Fletcher Mnf'g. Co. who are large dealers in  these goods.    The colors prepared, consisting of several very nice shades of yellow  and red, also coffee brown, jetoline black, damson blue, and apple  green; they are in paste, ready for use, being vegetable, they are  guaranteed strictly wholesome, and may be used with confidence.      WRINKLES WORTH READING ON SUGAR BOILING.    To make an acid drop to perfection, the pan must not only be clean but  bright; use best white sugar, and just enough water to melt it, with a  little extra cream of tartar (no glucose); boil on a sharp fire to 305;  after passing through machine, well dust with icing sugar and bottle.  Beginners should not try to work with less water, as the boil is more  liable to grain, which can be seen by an expert and avoided. Before  putting on the boil see that there is sufficient fuel on the furnace to  carry through the operation. To make up a fire during the process spoils  the color and quality. The sharper the sugar is boiled the better the  appearance and durability.    When boiling common sugars have the pan large enough,--some throw up a  good deal of foam when they reach the boiling point and are liable to  flow over--watch closely, and if unable to beat the foam down, lift the  pan on the side of the fire a few minutes until boiled through.    Many weak sugars burn on a clear fire before they come to a degree of  crack. In this case sprinkle a little fresh fuel or ashes over the fire  and replace the pan again. Should it again catch, repeat the operation  nursing it up to the desired degree. Bad boiling sugar is very  troublesome. A good plan is to make a rule of straining the batch just  after it boils, through a very fine copper wire or hair sieve, this  prevents foreign matter such as grit, saw dust or even nails, which is  often mixed with the sugar getting into the goods. Keep thermometer when  not in use in jar of water standing on the furnace plate by the side of  the pan, wash out the jar and fill with cold water every morning; keep  the thermometer clean, especially the top part, as the sugar which  adheres to it becomes grainy, and might spoil a whole boil. After making  many dark candies thoroughly wash the thermometer before putting into a  light boil.    In using colors for drops and clear goods, use them in the form of a  paste where practicable, then you can mix them in when the boil is on  the slab, thus saving your pan; keep the colors damp in jars, look over  them every night, and, where necessary, add a little cold water to keep  them moist, or the top may get dry and hard, which would make the goods  specky. Use a separate piece of stick for each color to rub in with, and  be careful not to use too much color; a very little goes a long way with  clear boiled goods. Goods are more often spoiled by using too much than  too little; more can always be added if the shades are too light, but  there is no remedy if you have added too much. When coloring taffies,  this must be done in the pan; liquid colors are best; trouble will be  saved if used in the following order. Suppose Raspberry, Everton and  Lemon taffies were wanted, make the Lemon taffy first, add saffron just  before the boil is ready, then the lemon, and pour out; make the Everton  taffy next in the same way, add the butter before the lemon; then make  the Raspberry. In this arrangement there is no necessity of steaming out  the pan. Had the Raspberry taffy been made first, the pan would have to  be cleaned out before the Lemon or Everton taffy could have been made,  because it would have been red.    Measure the flavors in a graduated glass; wash out the glass frequently,  or it will get rancid; weigh the acid and see that it is well ground; if  it has become dry and lumpy, rub it down to a powder with a rolling pin  or heavy bottle on a sheet of paper before using. In using fruit  essences a little powdered tartaric acid throws up the flavor, half the  essences will have a better effect. Put the acid on the boil after it  has been poured on the slab in a little heap, and pour the essence over  it, then thoroughly incorporate the whole.    Use the best oil for the slab with a clean flannel cloth; keep the cloth  in a saucer, if it lies about it falls on the floor and picks up dirt  and carries it to the pouring plate. When it gets hard or gritty burn it  at once and get a new one, or it may be used by mistake and make a mess.  We have seen the beauty of a boil spoilt scores of times by using dirty  rags and rancid oil. A sugar boiler cannot be too careful in these  little details, the success of his work largely depends upon it. It is  easy to inaugurate a good system, and much more comfortable to work to  it than a slovenly \"what shall I do next\" sort of a method. Know where  to find and put your hand on everything; when the boil is hot there is  no time to look for what you require. \"A place for everything and  everything in its place\" should be a practical feature in every boiling  shop.      STICKY CANDIES.    Perhaps there is nothing more annoying to the trade than sticky boiled  sugars. All clear goods when exposed to the atmosphere will turn damp,  especially in wet weather. It is a question of degree, some slightly and  some will run almost to syrup; it is impossible to obviate the former  but the latter can be prevented. Great care should be used in adding the  lowering, whether cream of tartar or glucose, too much of either will  cause the goods to run immediately after they are turned out. Weak or  inferior sugars, or not sufficient boiling, has also this effect. We  know of no reliable agent which will altogether prevent this result but  we do know that a careful arrangement of the different proportions,  using good sugar and well boiling greatly mitigate, if not altogether  prevent the grievance. Goods intended for exposure should contain just  sufficient lowering to prevent the boil from growing grainy and boiled  right up to the standard. Of course different sugars will carry more or  less lowering, but this can be easily tested by the workman. A few  experiments will determine the exact quantity for each boil. There is no  excuse for drops sticking in bottles when corked, this should not  occur, if it does, the fault is in the making; the water has a great  deal to do with causing the candies to be sticky. The writer has  experienced this in several country places, where the only supply of  this indispensable ingredient was drawn from the artesian wells. To look  at it, it was all that could be desired--a beautiful, cold, clear and  wholesome beverage. Of its chemical constituents I do not pretend to  give an opinion, but the drops and other clear boils for which it was  used got damp directly after they were exposed, and would have run to a  syrup had they not been covered up. The goods keep all right in bottles,  but it is very annoying, not to speak of the injury and loss to a  business, when this is the position with regard to the water supply. The  only remedy we could suggest, and which was very successful, was  powdered borax. We used this in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031"],[0,"Wild Animals I Have Known (#3)"],[1,"avail to destroy this robber, and though I continued  to use it while awaiting the arrival of the traps, it was only because  it was meanwhile a sure means of killing many prairie wolves and other  destructive vermin.    About this time there came under my observation an incident that will  illustrate Lobo's diabolic cunning. These wolves had at least one  pursuit which was merely an amusement; it was stampeding and killing  sheep, though they rarely ate them. The sheep are usually kept in flocks  of from one thousand to three thousand under one or more shepherds. At  night they are gathered in the most sheltered place available, and a  herdsman sleeps on each side of the flock to give additional protection.  Sheep are such senseless creatures that they are liable to be stampeded  by the veriest trifle, but they have deeply ingrained in their nature  one, and perhaps only one, strong weakness, namely, to follow their  leader. And this the shepherds turn to good account by putting half a  dozen goats in the flock of sheep. The latter recognize the superior  intelligence of their bearded cousins, and when a night alarm occurs  they crowd around them, and usually are thus saved from a stampede and  are easily protected. But it was not always so. One night late in last  November, two Perico shepherds were aroused by an onset of wolves. Their  flocks huddled around the goats, which, being neither fools nor cowards,  stood their ground and were bravely defiant; but alas for them, no  common wolf was heading this attack. Old Lobo, the werewolf, knew as  well as the shepherds that the goats were the moral force of the flock,  so, hastily running over the backs of the densely packed sheep, he  fell on these leaders, slew them all in a few minutes, and soon had the  luckless sheep stampeding in a thousand different directions. For weeks  afterward I was almost daily accosted by some anxious shepherd, who  asked, \"Have you seen any stray OTO sheep lately?\" and usually I was  obliged to say I had; one day it was, \"Yes, I came on some five or six  carcasses by Diamond Springs;\" or another, it was to the effect that I  had seen a small \"bunch\" running on the Malpai Mesa; or again, \"No, but  Juan Meira saw about twenty, freshly killed, on the Cedra Monte two days  ago.\"    At length the wolf traps arrived, and with two men I worked a whole week  to get them properly set out. We spared no labor or pains, I adopted  every device I could think of that might help to insure success. The  second day after the traps arrived, I rode around to inspect, and soon  came upon Lobo's trail running from trap to trap. In the dust I could  read the whole story of his doings that night. He had trotted along in  the darkness, and although the traps were so carefully concealed, he had  instantly detected the first one. Stopping the onward march of the pack,  he had cautiously scratched around it until he had disclosed the trap,  the chain, and the log, then left them wholly exposed to view with the  trap still unsprung, and passing on he treated over a dozen traps in the  same fashion. Very soon I noticed that he stopped and turned aside as  soon as he detected suspicious signs on the trail, and a new plan to  outwit him at once suggested itself. I set the traps in the form of an  H; that is, with a row of traps on each side of the trail, and one on  the trail for the cross-bar of the H. Before long, I had an opportunity  to count another failure. Lobo came trotting along the trail, and was  fairly between the parallel lines before he detected the single trap  in the trail, but he stopped in time, and why or how he knew enough I  cannot tell, the Angel of the wild things must have been with him, but  without turning an inch to the right or left, he slowly and cautiously  backed on his own tracks, putting each paw exactly in its old track  until he was off the dangerous ground. Then returning at one side he  scratched clods and stones with his hind feet till he had sprung every  trap. This he did on many other occasions, and although I varied  my methods and redoubled my precautions, he was never deceived, his  sagacity seemed never at fault, and he might have been pursuing his  career of rapine to-day, but for an unfortunate alliance that proved  his ruin and added his name to the long list of heroes who, unassailable  when alone, have fallen through the indiscretion of a trusted ally.    III    Once or twice, I had found indications that everything was not  quite right in the Currumpaw pack. There were signs of irregularity,  I thought; for instance there was clearly the trail of a smaller wolf  running ahead of the leader, at times, and this I could not understand  until a cowboy made a remark which explained the matter.    \"I saw them to-day,\" he said, \"and the wild one that breaks away is  Blanca.\" Then the truth dawned upon me, and I added, \"Now, I know that  Blanca is a she-wolf, because were a he-wolf to act thus, Lobo would  kill him at once.\"    This suggested a new plan. I killed a heifer, and set one or two rather  obvious traps about the carcass. Then cutting off the head, which is  considered useless offal, and quite beneath the notice of a wolf, I set  it a little apart and around it placed six powerful steel traps properly  deodorized and concealed with the utmost care. During my operations  I kept my hands, boots, and implements smeared with fresh blood, and  afterward sprinkled the ground with the same, as though it had flowed  from the head; and when the traps were buried in the dust I brushed the  place over with the skin of a coyote, and with a foot of the same animal  made a number of tracks over the traps. The head was so placed that  there was a narrow passage between it and some tussocks, and in this  passage I buried two of my best traps, fastening them to the head  itself.    Wolves have a habit of approaching every carcass they get the wind of,  in order to examine it, even when they have no intention of eating it,  and I hoped that this habit would bring the Currumpaw pack within  reach of my latest stratagem. I did not doubt that Lobo would detect my  handiwork about the meat, and prevent the pack approaching it, but I did  build some hopes on the head, for it looked as though it had been thrown  aside as useless.    Next morning, I sallied forth to inspect the traps, and there, oh, joy!  were the tracks of the pack, and the place where the beef-head and its  traps had been was empty. A hasty study of the trail showed that Lobo  had kept the pack from approaching the meat, but one, a small wolf, had  evidently gone on to examine the head as it lay apart and had walked  right into one of the traps.    We set out on the trail, and within a mile discovered that the hapless  wolf was Blanca. Away she went, however, at a gallop, and although  encumbered by the beef-head, which weighed over fifty pounds, she  speedily distanced my companion, who was on foot. But we overtook her  when she reached the rocks, for the horns of the cow's head became  caught and held her fast. She was the handsomest wolf I had ever seen.  Her coat was in perfect condition and nearly white.    She turned to fight, and, raising her voice in the rallying cry of her  race, sent a long howl rolling over the canyon. From far away upon the  mesa came a deep response, the cry of Old Lobo. That was her last call,  for now we had closed in on her, and all her energy and breath were  devoted to combat.    Then followed the inevitable tragedy, the idea of which I shrank from  afterward more than at the time. We each threw a lasso over the neck of  the doomed wolf, and strained our horses in opposite directions until  the blood burst from her mouth, her eyes glazed, her limbs stiffened  and then fell limp. Homeward then we rode, carrying the dead wolf, and  exulting over this, the first death-blow we had been able to inflict on  the Currumpaw pack.    At intervals during the tragedy, and afterward as we rode homeward, we  heard the roar of Lobo as he wandered about on the distant mesas, where  he seemed to be searching for Blanca. He had never really deserted  her, but, knowing that he could not save her, his deep-rooted dread of  firearms had been too much for him when he saw us approaching. All that  day we heard him wailing as he roamed in his quest, and I remarked at  length to one of the boys, \"Now, indeed, I truly know that Blanca was  his mate.\"    As evening fell he seemed to be coming toward the home canyon, for his  voice sounded continually nearer.    There was an unmistakable note of sorrow in it now. It was no longer  the loud, defiant howl, but a long, plaintive wail; \"Blanca! Blanca!\"  he seemed to call. And as night came down, I noticed that he was not far  from the place where we had overtaken her. At length he seemed to find  the trail, and when he came to the spot where we had killed her, his  heartbroken wailing was piteous to hear. It was sadder than I could  possibly have believed. Even the stolid cowboys noticed it, and said  they had \"never heard a wolf carry on like that before.\" He seemed to  know exactly what had taken place, for her blood had stained the place  of her death.    Then he took up the trail of the horses and followed it to the  ranch-house. Whether in hopes of finding her there, or in quest of  revenge, I know not, but the latter was what he found, for he surprised  our unfortunate watchdog outside and tore him to little bits within  fifty yards of the door. He evidently came alone this time, for I found  but one trail next morning, and he had galloped about in a reckless  manner that was very unusual with him. I had half expected this, and had  set a number of additional traps about the pasture. Afterward I found  that he had indeed fallen into one of these, but, such was his strength,  he had torn himself loose and cast it aside.    I believed that he would continue in the neighborhood until he found her  body "]]]
