[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],[0,"A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#3)"],[1," bistincta bistincta_  by having \"the gray reticulation of the sides entirely broken up into  elongate black blotches; tarsal fold moderately elevated.\" The  condition of the tarsal fold is characteristic of the species. The  dispersion of dark pigment on the flanks is variable. The type of  _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ (USNM 123689) is extreme in the  development of dark dashes on the flanks, but this condition is  approached in several specimes from Oaxaca and Veracruz. For example,  in some specimens from Cumbres de Acultzingo, Veracruz, the mottling  on the flanks is bold; in others the flanks are reticulated. The  specimen from San Vicente, Oaxaca, has black dashes on the flanks  (Smith and Williams, 1963:23), whereas a specimen from Cerro San  Felipe, Oaxaca, has no pattern on the flanks. In general, specimens  from western Mexico have reticulate mottling on the flanks as compared  with the marbling on the flanks in specimens from eastern Mexico. On  the basis of available data, the recognition of subspecies in _Hyla  bistincta_ is unwarranted.    The tadpoles of this species described by Duellman (1961:47) are like  those of _Hyla robertsorum_ in having 2/3 tooth-rows, peglike  serrations on the beaks, and long, rounded tails. At Uruapan tadpoles  were found in a rocky stream on April 24, 1956, and metamorphosing  young were found there on August 2, 1956. A completely metamorphosed  juvenile has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm.    _Hyla bistincta_ is found only along streams, where individuals can be  seen clinging to vines and other vegetation closely over-hanging  fast-moving parts of the stream.    _Distribution._--_Hyla bistincta_ occurs at elevations from 1400 to  2600 meters in the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western  Jalisco southward through the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacan,  Mexico, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcoman in Michoacan, and the  Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and thence northward in  the Sierra Madre Oriental to central Veracruz (Fig. 2).

[Illustration: FIG. 3. Holotype of _Hyla charadricola_      (KU 58414). x 1.5.]    _Variation._--Adult males have snout-vent lengths from 35.3 to 44.4  mm., and adult females from 43.4 to 50.9 mm. No notable variation in  structure is displayed in the type series. In some individuals the  dark reticulation on the dorsum is faint. Juveniles in life had dorsal  colorations varying from rich brown with darker reticulations to pale  green or gray with dark green reticulations. Some adults when  collected were pale green with faint or no dorsal reticulations; later  these individuals darkened. In all specimens the anal stripe is  absent, and the flanks are heavily spotted.    _Comparisons.--Hyla charadricola_ differs from all other members of  the _Hyla bistincta_ group in the following combination of characters:  truncate snout, green dorsum, and absence of a thoracic fold. From  other hylids that occur in the same area, _Hyla charadricola_ differs  from _Hyla miotympanum_ and _H. arborescandens_, both of which are  green dorsally, by having a truncate snout and longer fingers with  less webbing. _Hyla eximia_, though green, has brown dorsal spots,  shorter fingers, and a round snout. _Hyla robertsorum_ differs in  having a round snout and brown dorsum, and _Hyla taeniopus_ is much  larger, has transverse bands on the limbs, and has extensive webbing  between fingers.    _Remarks._--At the type locality, a shallow rocky stream in pine  forest, _Hyla charadricola_ was found beneath rocks at the edge of  fast moving sections of the stream and beneath rocks in shallow  riffles in the stream. Most of the frogs were in water. At night  they were found sitting on rocks in the stream. _Hyla miotympanum_,  which is abundant at the type locality, lives in bushes and beneath  rocks along the stream but usually is not found in the riffles inhabited  by _Hyla charadricola_. At Lago de Tejocotal _Hyla charadricola_  was found beneath rocks near the shore of the lake and by a  stream in the pine forest. Individuals were found on low vegetation  over-hanging a small stream in pine-oak forest four kilometers southwest  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],[0,"Black Amazon of Mars (#3)"],[1," certain talisman.\"    Stark said, \"My comrade was called Greshi.\" The leather belt weighed  heavy about him, and the iron boss seemed hot against his belly. He was  beginning, now, to be afraid.           *       *       *       *       *    The Lord Ciaran spoke, ignoring Stark. \"It was the sacred talisman of  Kushat. Without it, the city is like a man without a soul.\"    As the Veil of Tanit was to Carthage, Stark thought, and reflected on  the fate of that city after the Veil was stolen.    \"The nobles were afraid of their own people,\" the man in armor said.  \"They did not dare to tell that it was gone. But we know.\"    \"And,\" said Stark, \"you will attack Kushat before the thaw, when they  least expect you.\"    \"You have a sharp mind, stranger. Yes. But the great wall will be hard  to carry, even so. If I came, bearing in _my_ hands the talisman of Ban  Cruach....\"    He did not finish, but turned instead to Thord. \"When you plundered the  dead man's body, what did you find?\"    \"Nothing, Lord. A few coins, a knife, hardly worth the taking.\"    \"And you, Eric John Stark. What did you take from the body?\"    With perfect truth he answered, \"Nothing.\"    \"Thord,\" said the Lord Ciaran, \"search him.\"    Thord came smiling up to Stark and ripped his jacket open.    With uncanny swiftness, the Earthman moved. The edge of one broad hand  took Thord under the ear, and before the man's knees had time to sag  Stark had caught his arm. He turned, crouching forward, and pitched  Thord headlong through the door flap.    He straightened and turned again. His eyes held a feral glint. \"The man  has robbed me once,\" he said. \"It is enough.\"    He heard Thord's men coming. Three of them tried to jam through the  entrance at once, and he sprang at them. He made no sound. His fists did  the talking for him, and then his feet, as he kicked the stunned  barbarians back upon their leader.    \"Now,\" he said to the Lord Ciaran, \"will we talk as men?\"    The man in armor laughed, a sound of pure enjoyment. It seemed that the  gaze behind the mask studied Stark's savage face, and then lifted to  greet the sullen Thord who came back into the shelter, his cheeks  flushed crimson with rage.    \"Go,\" said the Lord Ciaran. \"The stranger and I will talk.\"    \"But Lord,\" he protested, glaring at Stark, \"it is not safe....\"    \"My dark mistress looks after my safety,\" said Ciaran, stroking the axe  across his knees. \"Go.\"    Thord went.    The man in armor was silent then, the blind mask turned to Stark, who  met that eyeless gaze and was silent also. And the bundle of rags in the  shadows straightened slowly and became a tall old man with rusty hair  and beard, through which peered craggy juts of bone and two bright,  small points of fire, as though some wicked flame burned within him.    He shuffled over and crouched at the feet of the Lord Ciaran, watching  the Earthman. And the man in armor leaned forward.    \"I will tell you something, Eric John Stark. I am a bastard, but I come  of the blood of kings. My name and rank I must make with my own hands.  But I will set them high, and my name will ring in the Norlands!    \"I will take Kushat. Who holds Kushat, holds Mars--and the power and the  riches that lie beyond the Gates of Death!\"    \"I have seen them,\" said the old man, and his eyes blazed. \"I have seen  Ban Cruach the mighty. I have seen the temples and the palaces glitter  in the ice. I have seen _Them_, the shining ones. Oh, I have seen them,  the beautiful, hideous ones!\"    He glanced sidelong at Stark, very cunning. \"That is why Otar is mad,  stranger. _He has seen._\"    A chill swept Stark. He too had seen, not with his own eyes but with the  mind and memories of Ban Cruach, of a million years ago.    Then it had been no illusion, the fantastic vision opened to him by the  talisman now hidden in his belt! If this old madman had seen....    \"What beings lurk beyond the Gates of Death I do not know,\" said Ciaran.  \"But my dark mistress will test their strength--and I think my red  wolves will hunt them down, once they get a smell of plunder.\"    \"The beautiful, terrible ones,\" whispered Otar. \"And oh, the temples and  the palaces, and the great towers of stone!\"    \"Ride with me, Stark,\" said the Lord Ciaran abruptly. \"Yield up the  talisman, and be the shield at my back. I have offered no other man that  honor.\"    Stark asked slowly, \"Why do you choose me?\"    \"We are of one blood, Stark, though we be strangers.\"    The Earthman's cold eyes narrowed. \"What would your red wolves say to  that? And what would Otar say? Look at him, already stiff with jealousy,  and fear lest I answer, 'Yes'.\"    \"I do not think you would be afraid of either of them.\"    \"On the contrary,\" said Stark, \"I am a prudent man.\" He paused. \"There  is one other thing. I will bargain with no man until I have looked into  his eyes. Take off your helm, Ciaran--and then perhaps we will talk!\"    Otar's breath made a snakelike hissing between his toothless gums, and  the hands of the Lord Ciaran tightened on the haft of the axe.    \"No!\" he whispered. \"That I can never do.\"    Otar rose to his feet, and for the first time Stark felt the full  strength that lay in this strange old man.    \"Would you look upon the face of destruction?\" he thundered. \"Do you ask  for death? Do you think a thing is hidden behind a mask of steel without  a reason, that you demand to see it?\"    He turned. \"My Lord,\" he said. \"By tomorrow the last of the clans will  have joined us. After that, we must march. Give this Earthman to Thord,  for the time that remains--and you will have the talisman.\"    The blank, blind mask was unmoving, turned toward Stark, and the  Earthman thought that from behind it came a faint sound that might have  been a sigh.    Then....    \"Thord!\" cried the Lord Ciaran, and lifted up the axe.          III      The flames leaped high from the fire in the windless gorge. Men sat  around it in a great circle, the wild riders out of the mountain valleys  of Mekh. They sat with the curbed and shivering eagerness of wolves  around a dying quarry. Now and again their white teeth showed in a kind  of silent laughter, and their eyes watched.    \"He is strong,\" they whispered, one to the other. \"He will live the  night out, surely!\"    On an outcrop of rock sat the Lord Ciaran, wrapped in a black cloak,  holding the great axe in the crook of his arm. Beside him, Otar huddled  in the snow.    Close by, the long spears had been driven deep and lashed together to  make a scaffolding, and upon this frame was hung a man. A big man,  iron-muscled and very lean, the bulk of his shoulders filling the space  between the bending shafts. Eric John Stark of Earth, out of Mercury.    He had already been scourged without mercy. He sagged of his own weight  between the spears, breathing in harsh sobs, and the trampled snow  around him was spotted red.    Thord was wielding the lash. He had stripped off his own coat, and his  body glistened with sweat in spite of the cold. He cut his victim with  great care, making the long lash sing and crack. He was proud of his  skill.    Stark did not cry out.    Presently Thord stepped back, panting, and looked at the Lord Ciaran.  And the black helm nodded.    Thord dropped the whip. He went up to the big dark man and lifted his  head by the hair.    \"Stark,\" he said, and shook the head roughly. \"Stranger!\"    Eyes opened and stared at him, and Thord could not repress a slight  shiver. It seemed that the pain and indignity had wrought some evil  magic on this man he had ridden with, and thought he knew. He had seen  exactly the same gaze in a big snow-cat caught in a trap, and he felt  suddenly that it was not a man he spoke to, but a predatory beast.    \"Stark,\" he said. \"Where is the talisman of Ban Cruach?\"    The Earthman did not answer.    Thord laughed. He glanced up at the sky, where the moons rode low and  swift.    \"The night is only half gone. Do you think you can last it out?\"    The cold, cruel, patient eyes watched Thord. There was no reply.    Some quality of pride in that gaze angered the barbarian. It seemed to  mock him, who was so sure of his ability to loosen a reluctant tongue.    \"You think I cannot make you talk, don't you? You don't know me,  stranger! You don't know Thord, who can make the rocks speak out if he  will!\"    He reached out with his free hand and struck Stark across the face.    It seemed impossible that anything so still could move so quickly. There  was an ugly flash of teeth, and Thord's wrist was caught above the  thumb-joint. He bellowed, and the iron jaws closed down, worrying the  bone.    Quite suddenly, Thord screamed. Not for pain, but for panic. And the  rows of watching men swayed forward, and even the Lord Ciaran rose up,  startled.    \"_Hark!_\" ran the whispering around the fire. \"Hark how he growls!\"    Thord had let go of Stark's hair and was beating him about the head with  his clenched fist. His face was white.    \"Werewolf!\" he screamed. \"Let me go, beast-thing! Let me go!\"    But the dark man clung to Thord's wrist, snarling, and did not hear.  After a bit there came the dull crack of bone.    Stark opened his jaws. Thord ceased to strike him. He backed off slowly,  staring at the torn flesh. Stark had sunk down to the length of his  arms.    With his left hand, Thord drew his knife. The Lord Ciaran stepped  forward. \"Wait, Thord!\"    \"It is a thing of evil,\" whispered the barbarian. \"Warlock. Werewolf.  Beast.\"    He sprang at Stark.           *       *       *       *       *    The man in armor moved, very swiftly, and the great axe went whirling  through the air. It caught Thord squarely where the cords of his neck  ran into the shoulder--caught, and shore on through.    There was a silence in the valley.    The Lord Ciaran walked slowly across the trampled snow and took up his  axe again.    \"I will be obeyed,\" he said. \"And I will not stand for fear, not of god,  man, nor devil.\""]]]
