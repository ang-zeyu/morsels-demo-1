Averages three quarters of a pound to one pound  and a half in the streams, and one pound to three pounds in the lakes  and ponds. Occurs between latitude 32-1/2 deg. and 55 deg., in the lakes and  streams of the Atlantic watershed, near the sources of a few rivers  flowing into the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, and some of the  southern affluents of Hudson Bay, its range being limited by the  western foothills of the Alleghanies, extending about three hundred  miles from the coast, except about the Great Lakes, in the northern  tributaries of which it abounds. It also inhabits the headwaters of  the Chattahoochee, in the southern spurs of the Georgia Alleghanies  and tributaries of the Catawba in North Carolina, and clear waters of  the great islands of the Gulf of St. Lawrence--Anticosti, Cape  Breton. Prince Edward, and Newfoundland; and abounds in New York,  Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania. Maine, Long Island, Canada,  Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.

No. I.          OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVANTS.    CHARLES B. HADDOCK,    CHARGE D'AFFAIRES FOR PORTUGAL.    [With a Portrait, Engraved by J. Andrews.]      Old notions of diplomacy are obsolete. The plain, straightforward, and  masterly manner in which Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton managed the  difficult affairs which a few years ago threatened war between this  country and England have taught mankind a useful lesson on this subject.  We perceive that the London _Times_ has been engaged in a controversy  whether there should be diplomatists or no diplomatists, whether, in  fact, the profession should survive; arguing from this case conducted by  our illustrious Secretary and Lord Ashburton, that negotiation in  foreign countries is plain sailing for great men, and that common agents  would do the necessary business on ordinary occasions. We are not  prepared to accept the doctrine of the _Times_, though ready enough to  admit that it is to be preferred to the employment of such persons as  many whom we have sent abroad in the last twenty years--many who now in  various capacities represent the United States in foreign countries.  Upon this question however we do not propose now to enter. It is one  which may be deferred still a long time--until the means of  intercommunication shall be greater than steam and electricity have yet  made them, or until the evils of unworthy representation shall have  driven people to the possible dangers of an abandonment of the system  without such a reason. We design in this and future numbers of the  _International_ simply to give a few brief personal sketches of the most  honorably distinguished of the diplomatic servants of the United States  now abroad, and we commence with the newly-appointed _Charge d'Affaires_  to Lisbon.    Charles Brickett Haddock was born at Salisbury (now Franklin), New  Hampshire, on the 20th of June, 1796. His father, William Haddock, was a  native of Haverhill, Massachusetts. His paternal grandfather removed  from Boston to Haverhill, and married a sister of Dr. Charles Brickett,  an eminent physician of that town. The family, according to a tradition  among them, are descended from Admiral Sir Richard Haddocke, one of ten  sons and eleven daughters of Mr. Haddocke, of Lee, in England. Richard  Haddocke was an eminent officer in the Royal Navy. He was knighted  before 1678, and returned a member of Parliament the same year, and  again in 1685. He died in 1713, and was buried in the family vault at  Lee, where there is a gravestone, with brass plates on which are  engraved portraits of his father, his father's three wives, and thirteen  sons and eleven daughters.    The mother of Dr. Haddock was Abigail Webster, a favorite sister of  Ezekiel and Daniel Webster, who, with Sarah, were the only children of  the Hon. Ebenezer Webster by his second wife, Abigail Eastman, who  survived her husband and all her daughters. Mrs. Haddock was a woman of  strong character, and greatly beloved in society. She died in December,  1805, at the age of twenty-seven, leaving two sons, Charles and William,  one about nine and the other seven years of age. Her last words to her  husband were, \"I leave you two beautiful boys: my wish is that you  should educate them both.\" The injunction was not forgotten; both were  in due time placed at a preparatory school in Salisbury, both entered  Dartmouth College, and without an academic censure or reproof graduated  with distinction.
