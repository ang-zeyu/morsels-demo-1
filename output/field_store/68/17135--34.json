The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet within a  few miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean afford many  special advantages for the study of things not in books. Special  advantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits its  attendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred  applicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by  the large proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced work in  the large universities. In addition, well-manned departments of music  and art afford exceptional advantages.

The No. 2, which is the smallest size of the double spring style is  known as the fox trap. It is also the best size for coon and is  sometimes used for otter especially in the North but in my opinion it  is too small for regular use on otter.    Next in order is the No. 3 which has been named the otter trap, and  it is the proper size to use for this animal. It is also used for  catching the coyote, beaver, wild cat and lynx and is a very popular  trap in the more remote sections of the country.    The No. 4 trap was originally intended for the capture of the beaver  and is the proper size for that animal. The higher grades of this are  also used to a great extent for trapping the timber wolf, also for  otter and coyote.    The best trap for wolves, however, is the 4 1/2 which was designed  especially for trapping these animals. It is considerably heavier  than the No. 4 and is fitted with a longer chain and a pronged drag.  This size is also used for taking the cougar or mountain lion.    The bear traps are known as the No. 50, the No. 5 and the No. 6. The  No. 50 is the smallest but is sufficiently strong for the black bear.  For those who prefer a larger trap for this animal, the No. 5 will  prove satisfactory, and it will also hold the grizzly, but is rather  small for that animal. The size best adapted to the capture of the  larger varieties of bears is the No. 6, which will hold almost any  living animal.    In addition to the traps mentioned, there are a number of special  styles designed to meet the demand from those trappers who desire  special traps for some certain animals. Among these may be mentioned  the clutch traps, the single spring otter traps and the traps with  offset jaws.    It should be understood that in writing the foregoing description of  traps, I had in mind the higher grades only. In the following  chapters devoted to the capture of the various animals, the proper  sizes and brands of traps to use will be given.      [Illustration: The Skunk.]        CHAPTER II.    THE SKUNK.    The skunk is an animal of the weasel family, and is found throughout  the United States and the southern parts of Canada. A full grown  specimen will usually measure sixteen or eighteen inches, from the  nose to the root of the tail, which is about twelve or fourteen  inches long and quite bushy. The color is a glossy black, with  usually, a white V-shaped stripe extending from the top of the head  to about half the length of the back. Often, this stripe is quite  broad and extends the length of the body, while in others the stripe  is missing, there being only a white spot on the head, and a white  tip to the tail; this latter marking being found on all specimens. In  some of the Pacific coast States, a variety is found having only a  single white stripe running the entire length of the back. There is  also a small species found in parts of the Mississippi valley, which  has white spots, instead of stripes. This animal is known to the fur  trade as well as the trappers, as the \"civet cat\", although the true  civet cat is quite a different animal.    The skunk has become quite famous, among country folks, because of  its powerful scent, which is found in two glands near the root of the  tail, which the animal can eject at will. This scent is perhaps the  most powerful and offensive of all odors, and the use of it is the  skunk's only means of defending itself against enemies.    The skunk makes its den in the ground, usually along a gravelly  hill-side, and it sometimes makes use of the den of the woodchuck. In  thickly settled countries where the dens have been destroyed by  hunters, they often make their homes under barns and out-buildings,  and even under dwelling houses, much to the discomfort of the  inmates.    The skunk is a nocturnal animal, searching for food only at night and  remaining in its den during the day. During the cold part of the  winter, they remain in their dens, coming out only on warm nights,  until after the middle of February, when their mating season  commences, and the males travel, at this time in almost all kinds of  weather.    The young are born in April and May, and there are usually from four  to ten in a litter, though occasionally there will be a larger  number.    Their food consists mostly of insects, grubs, young birds and eggs,  and when they have an opportunity to do so, they will kill and eat  poultry, etc. They are also fond of carrion, and even the flesh of  their own kind.    In the northern states the skunk becomes prime about the last week in  October, while in the extreme south they are probably not prime until  the last week in November. In the north they commence to shed their  fur about the tenth or fifteenth of March, while in the south they  shed still earlier. During very cold weather, when the skunks have  been confined to their dens for a considerable length of time, the  warmth of the dens has a tendency to injure the fur. The males also  fight among themselves and their fur is often injured in this way. At  other times the fur is spoiled somewhat, because of too small an  entrance to the den, the fur having a rubbed or woolly appearance. It  is the fine black skins taken when in the best condition, that are  the most valuable. Skunks are, perhaps, found in the greatest numbers  in the eastern states, and the trappers from that section, make more  money from skunks than from any other animal.    In winter, one may track them to their dens, and if the den is a good  one, may find any number of skunks, up to a dozen, in the same den.  It is a common practice to dig the den open and kill all the inmates,  but as this method means the destruction of a good den, it is not  advisable to do so. The best way is to trap them, as in this way the  den will not be injured, and it is almost certain that you will find  skunks in the same den each season. Such a den is worth money to the  trapper. The oil of the skunk, if rendered carefully, without  burning, is useful, and is often used by country people as a remedy  for croup.    The most common method of trapping the skunk is to set the trap in  the entrance of the den, without bait, but where there are many dens,  or where the dens are hard to find, it is best to use bait. In  setting the trap in a den, it should be set just inside the entrance,  unless the mouth of the den is small, when it should be set just  outside. The trap should be set with the jaws lengthwise of the hole,  so that the skunk steps between the jaws, and not over them, as by  stepping over the jaw the foot is likely to be thrown out of the  trap, by the jaw, as the trap springs. This rule also applies to all  traps set in dens or enclosures of any kind. The common way of  fastening is to stake the trap or fasten to a clog, but the balance  pole is better.    No great care is necessary in covering the trap, as the skunk is not  suspicious, but it is always best to use care, especially in setting  baited traps, as one never knows what animal may come along. On one  occasion I caught a fox in a trap set for skunk.    It is a good idea also, when trapping at dens, to put a small scrap  of bait inside of the den, as many skunks that are traveling about,  only look in and turn away, and if the trap is set inside, will not  be caught. If, however, there is a small bait inside the den, the  skunk will attempt to get it, and will be caught in the trap.    The traps most used for skunks are the No. 1 and No. 1 1/2. There are  also some special traps manufactured for these animals, having double  jaws or webbed jaws, to prevent the animal gnawing off its foot.    Traps set for skunk should be visited every day, as otherwise the  captured animals are likely to escape. They seem to struggle more on  dark stormy nights, and during such weather, one should get around to  his traps as early as possible in the morning.    Sometimes one can find a well-defined trail leading away from the  mouth of the den. In such a case, several traps may be set in the  trail, thus doubling or trebling the chance for a catch.    When good dens cannot be found, dig a hole under an old stump, and  place a bait inside, setting the trap directly in front of the hole  and cover with dry dirt. Sprinkle some scent about, on the stump and  ground; use care in setting as you are likely to catch a fox,  providing the trap is carefully set and covered, and the stake driven  out of sight. For bait use tainted meat of almost any kind.    Another good way is to find a spot of sandy ground, and set the trap  in a small hole, covering with sand. Cut the bait into small pieces  and scatter it all around the trap, also, if you have it, sprinkle  some scent around. The trap may be fastened to a brush drag, and the  brush set up to look as though it were growing there.    If you can find a tree or stump with two spreading roots, set the  trap between these roots and fasten the bait on the side of the tree,  about ten inches above the trap.    Still another way is to make a small pen of old, rotten wood, stones  or stakes, setting the trap in the entrance, and placing the bait in  the pen beyond the trap.    Any natural enclosure, such as a hollow log, a hole in the bank, or  in a wall or pile of stones, makes a good place in which to set a  trap.    Skunks may also be taken in box traps, deadfalls and snares, and they  seldom become scented when caught in such traps.    For bait, the following are all good: muskrat, skunk, chicken, birds  of any kind, rabbit, squirrel, mice, rotten eggs or fish--tainted  bait is always to be preferred for skunks, fresh bait being second  choice.    To make a good decoy, take one-half dozen rotten eggs, and the scent  of one skunk, and mix thoroughly. A mixture of the male and female  scent is probably best. Many of the decoys"]]]
