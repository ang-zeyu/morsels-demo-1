To meet this demand books have been published and articles  have appeared in the various women's papers giving directions for living  at all sorts of prices, from the extremely low one, \"How to Live on Ten  Cents a Day,\" to the normal one which requires the preparation of  appetizing and satisfying dinners at a nominal cost.    In order to accomplish living comfortably at small cost it is evident  that one must understand the comparative values of foods, so as to  select those which at low prices furnish the necessary nourishment, and,  also, be able to cook them in an appetizing way which will conserve the  nourishment. Meat is a necessity to most people. Yet much of the present  expense in the purchase of meat is needless and unwise. Many pieces of  meat of the best quality are sold at low rates because not in shapes to  be served as roasting or broiling pieces. These serve well for entrees  or made-up dishes. Other pieces which are tough but well flavored can,  in the hands of an educated cook, be sent to the table as tender,  palatable, sightly and nutritious as the prime cuts. It is to show some  methods of preparing these cheaper cuts of meat in an appetizing manner  that the following explanation of the processes of cooking and the  accompanying recipes are given.    Meat is cooked, first, to aid digestion; secondly, to develop new  flavors and render it more palatable.    For cooking there are three essentials besides the material to be  cooked--namely, heat, air, and moisture, the latter in the form of  water, either found in the food or added to it.    The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and bursts starch  grains, hardens albumen, and softens fiber.    Albumen is a substance like the white of an egg. It exists in the juices  of meat and contains much nourishment. If allowed to escape, the  nourishment is lost and the meat is hard. Therefore we have the first  general rule for the cooking of meat, namely:    _To retain the albumen, the outside of each piece of meat should be  seared or sealed at once before the cooking is continued._    Albumen is coagulated and hardened by intense heat. Therefrom comes the  second general rule, namely:    _Intense heat hardens and toughens meat, while a soft moist heat softens  the fiber._    From these general rules we pass to the specific methods of cooking  meat, which are nine in number--broiling, roasting, baking, frying,  sauteing, steaming, boiling, stewing, or fricasseeing.    Broiling and roasting are practically the same, the chief difference  being in the time employed. Both mean to expose one side of the meat to  the fire while the other is exposed to the air. By this method the meat  is quickly seared and the nutritive juices retained. Meat cooked in this  way is richer and finer in flavor.    Baking means cooking in a pan in the oven of a stove, and in these days  of hurry has largely superseded roasting.    Frying is the cooking by immersion in hot fat at a temperature of 350  degrees Fahrenheit. There must be sufficient fat to wholly cover each  article. This method is employed for croquettes, oysters, etc., and is  less injurious to digestion than sauteing.    Sauteing is cooking in a small quantity of fat, as an omelet or hashed  browned potatoes are cooked. This is the least wholesome of all methods  of cooking meat, and is often held directly responsible for indigestion.    Steaming is an admirable method of cooking tough meats or hams. Modern  housewives use a \"cooker,\" which comes for this purpose, but the  old-fashioned perforated steamer over a kettle of boiling water is also  good.    Boiling is one of the simplest methods of cooking the cheaper cuts of  meat. Properly employed, it consists in plunging the whole piece of meat  in a large kettle of rapidly boiling water. The meat should be entirely  covered by the water, which should continue to boil rapidly for five  minutes after the meat has been immersed in it. The temperature of the  water should then be immediately lowered to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. If  one has not a cooking thermometer, one has only to remember that water  boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and it will easily be seen that 160  degrees is considerably below the boiling point.    Stewing or fricasseeing is really cooking slowly in a sauce after the  meat has first been browned in a little hot fat. If the mixture is  allowed to boil the meat will be tough and shriveled, but if properly  stewed it will be soft and easy to digest. Fricasseeing is the most  economical of all methods of cooking meat, as there is very little loss  in weight, and what is lost from the meat is found in the sauce.    Braising is a method much used in France, and is a cross between  boiling and baking. It is done in a covered pan in the oven. The meat is  first browned in a little hot fat and then placed in a pan which is  partly filled with stock or water. The pan is covered closely and set in  a hot oven. After ten minutes the temperature of the oven is reduced to  a very low point, and the meat cooks slowly as the stock in the pan  evaporates. This method is the best for inferior pieces which require  long, slow cooking. It is an excellent method of cooking veal. Meat  which is lacking in flavor can be flavored by adding vegetables or herbs  to the stock in the pan.    Different cuts of meat require different methods of cooking to bring  about the best results. The following diagram and the accompanying  suggestions for proper cuts for certain methods of cooking are those  given by a prominent teacher in one of the leading domestic science  schools in the United States.

Mitchell, Instructor of Domestic Science at  Drexel, Pa., and formerly Dietitian of Manhattan Institute State  Hospital, N. Y.; Mrs. Runyon, manager of the lunchroom in the Boston  Chamber of Commerce; and Miss Armstrong, director of the Drexel  Institute lunchroom--all advocate the use of fireless cookers, and unite  in the assertion that it has invariably been found that a good  understanding of their management has resulted in success followed  inevitably by enthusiasm._          The Practical Value and Use of Fireless Cookers      This twentieth century is the age of progress in many directions, but  most of all in Domestic Science. Never before has so much attention been  devoted to the home. Journalists are giving columns of space to this  topic. Churches are directing their efforts to the betterment of the  home. Women's Clubs and charitable organizations have taken up the study  of the home. The most important result of all this action and thought is  the widespread awakening to the fact that the social and moral standing  of the home is directly dependent upon its hygienic and economic  condition.    In view of this fact, the National Federation of Women's Clubs has  practically covered the United States with their County, State, and  National Committees on Housekeeping. They know that bad cooking in the  home means unsatisfied stomachs, to gratify whose cravings the saloons  are filled; it means anemic children, a physical condition that tends to  produce criminals; it means premature funerals. To remedy these evils,  churches, journalists, philanthropists, clubs are alike working, and all  are working along the same lines--that is, better home furnishings,  better fuels, better utensils, more efficient, more economic, and less  laborious methods of housekeeping. They have not only sought and  introduced new inventions, but they have studied the past and adapted  and bettered the old.    Among the adaptations of the old ideas with new and modern improvements  is the fireless cooker. Ages ago Norwegian and German peasant women,  obliged to be away from the house all day working in the fields, knew  the secret of bringing food to the boiling point and then continuing its  cooking and keeping it hot by packing it in an improvised box of hay. In  the evening when the women returned, weary and worn from their field  labor, there was the family dinner all ready to serve.    German club women were the first to see the value of this idea adapted  to the needs of the German working class of the present day. These  German club women revived the hay boxes and distributed numbers of them  among poor families and began an educational campaign on their use. The  American manufacturer, ever on the alert for ideas, was quick to  perceive the economic and commercial advantages of making such an  appliance in an up-to-date manner, and so to-day we have on the market  numerous fireless cookers.    The principle of fireless cooking, though it bears the difficult name  of recaloration, is simple enough. It is merely the retention of heat  through complete insulation, just as we retain cold in the ice-box by  complete insulation. In the first case, a material which is a poor  conductor of heat is interposed between the kettle of hot food and the  surrounding atmosphere to prevent radiation or the escape of heat into  the surrounding air. In the second case, a poor conductor of heat is  placed between the ice and the warmer surrounding atmosphere to prevent  the contact of the atmosphere with the ice and the consequent  equalization"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33766"],[0,"History of Phosphorus (#3)"],[1,"of the phosphoric acids through  his previous studies of \"Alcoates, definite compounds of Salts and  Alcohol analogous to the Hydrates\" (1831). Liebig started from analogies  he saw with certain organic acids when he formulated the phosphoric  acids with a constant proportion of water (aq.) and varying proportions  of \"phosphoric acid\" (P) as follows:        2 P 3 aq.  phosphoric acid      3 P 3 aq.  pyrophosphoric acid      6 P 3 aq.  metaphosphoric acid.    [Illustration: Figure 7.--FLORIDA HARD-ROCK PHOSPHATE MINING. (From  Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States_, sixth  special report of the Commissioner of Labor, Government Printing Office,  Washington, 1893, plate facing page 43.)]    Salts are formed when a \"basis,\" i.e., a metal oxide, replaces water.  When potassium-acid sulfate is neutralized by sodium base, the acid-salt  divides into Glauber's salt and potassium sulfate, which proves the  acid-salt to be a mixture of the neutral salt with its acid. Sodium-acid  phosphate behaves quite differently. After neutralization by a potassium  \"base\" (hydroxide), the salt does not split up; a uniform  sodium-potassium phosphate is obtained. Therefore, phosphoric acid is  truly three-basic![23]    This result has later been confirmed, but the analogy by means of which  it had been obtained was very weak, in certain parts quite wrong.    The acids from the two lower oxides of phosphorus were also considered  as three-basic. Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) formulated them in 1846,  according to the theory of chemical types:        (PO)...              O^{3}  phosphoric acid        H^{3}        (PHO)..              O^{2}  phosphorus acid         H^{2}        (PH^{2}O).                 O   hypophosphorous acid.[24]             H    Further proof for these constitutions was sought in the study of the  esters formed when the acids react with alcohols.    Among the analogies and generalizations by which the research on  phosphoric acid was supported, and to the results of which it  contributed a full share, was the new theory of acids. Not oxygen,  Lavoisier's general acidifier, but reactive hydrogen determines the  character of acids. In this brief survey, it seems sufficient just to  mention this connection without describing it in detail.    The study of phosphoric acids led to important new concepts in  theoretical chemistry. The finding of polybasicity was extended to other  acids and formed the model that helped to recognize the  polyfunctionality in other compounds, like alcohols and amines. The  hydrogen theory of acids was fundamental for further advance. In another  dimension, it is particularly interesting to see that large-scale  applications followed almost immediately and directly from the new  theoretical insight. The first and foremost of these applications was in  agriculture.          Phosphates as Plant Nutrients      One hundred years after the discovery of \"cold light,\" the presence of  phosphorus in plants and animals was ascertained, and its form was  established as a compound of phosphoric acid. This knowledge had little  practical effect until the \"nature\" of the acid, in its various forms,  was explained through the work of Thomas Graham. From it, there started  a considerable technical development.    At about that time (1833), the Duke of Richmond proved that the  fertilizing value of bones resided not in the gelatin, nor in the  calcium, but in the phosphoric acid. Thus, he confirmed what Theodore de  Saussure had said in 1804, that \"we have no reason to believe\" that  plants can exist without phosphorus. Unknowingly at first, the farmer  had supplied this element by means of the organic fertilizers he used:  manure, excrements, bones, and horns. Now, with the value of phosphorus  known, a search began for mineral phosphates to be applied as  fertilizers. Jean Baptiste Boussingault (1802-1887), an agricultural  chemist in Lyons, traveled to Peru to see the guano deposits. Garcilaso  de la Vega (ca. 1540 to ca. 1616) noted in his history of Peru (1604)  that guano was used by the Incas as a fertilizer. Two hundred years  later, Alexander von Humboldt revived this knowledge, and Humphry Davy  wrote about the benefits of guano to the soil. Yet, the application of  this fertilizer developed only slowly, until Justus Liebig sang its  praise. Imports into England rose and far exceeded those into France  where, between 1857 and 1867, about 50,000 tons were annually received.    The other great advance in the use of phosphatic plant nutrients started  with Liebig's recommendation (1840) to treat bones with sulfuric acid  for solubilization. This idea was not entirely new; since 1832, a  production of a \"superphosphate\" from bones and sulfuric acid had been  in progress at Prague. At Rothamsted in 1842, John Bennet Lawes  obtained a patent on the manufacture of superphosphate. Other  manufactures in England followed and were successful, although James  Muspratt (1793-1886) at Newton lost much time and \"some thousands of  pounds\" on Liebig's idea of a \"mineral manure.\"    [Illustration: Figure 8.--FLORIDA LAND-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From  Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._,  plate facing page 58.)]    It was difficult enough to establish the efficacy of bones and  artificially produced phosphates in promoting the growth of plants under  special conditions of soils and climate; therefore, the question as to  the action of phosphates in the growing plant was not even seriously  formulated at that time. The beneficial effects were obvious enough to  increase the use of phosphates as plant nutrients and to call for new  sources of supply. Active developments of phosphate mining and treating  started in South Carolina in 1867, and in Florida in 1888.[25]    In a reciprocal action, more phosphate application to soils stimulated  increasing research on the conditions and reactions obtaining in the  complex and varying compositions called soil. The findings of  bacteriologists made it clear that physics and chemistry had to be  amplified by biology for a real understanding of fertilizer effects.  After 1900, for example, Julius Stoklasa (1857-1936) pointed out that  bacterial action in soil solubilizes water-insoluble phosphates and  makes them available to the plants.[26]    [Illustration: Figure 9.--FLORIDA RIVER-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE MINING. (From  Carroll D. Wright, _The Phosphate Industry of the United States ..._,  plate facing page 64.)]    The insight into the importance of phosphorus in organisms, especially  since Liebig's time, is reflected in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche  (1844-1900). This \"re-valuator of all values\" who modestly said of  himself: \"I am dynamite!\" once explained the human temperaments as  caused by the inorganic salts they contain: \"The differences in  temperament are perhaps caused more by the different distribution and  quantities of the inorganic salts than by everything else. Bilious  people have too little sodium sulfate, the melancholics are lacking in  potassium sulfate and phosphate; too little calcium phosphate in the  phlegmatics. Courageous natures have an excess of iron phosphate.\" (See  volume 12 of _Nietzsche's Works_, edit. Naumann-Kroener, Leipzig, 1886.)  In this strange association of inorganic salts with human temperaments,  the role of iron phosphate as a producer of courage is particularly  interesting. What would a modern philosopher conclude if he followed the  development of insight into the composition and function of complex  phosphate compounds in organisms?          From Inorganic to Organic Phosphates      By the middle of the 19th century, the source of phosphorus in natural  phosphates and the chemistry of its oxidation products had been  established. The main difficulty that had to be overcome was that these  oxidation products existed in so many forms, not only several stages of  oxidation, but, in addition, aggregations and condensations of the  phosphoric acids. Once the fundamental chemistry of these acids was  elucidated, the attention of chemists and physiologists turned to the  task of finding the actual state in which phosphorus compounds were  present in the organisms. It had been a great advance when it had been  shown that plants need phosphates in their soil. This led to the next  question concerning the materials in the body of the plant for which  phosphates were being used and into which they were incorporated.  Similarly, the knowledge that animals attain their phosphates from the  digested plant food called, in the next step of scientific inquiry, for  information on the nature of phosphates produced from this source.    The method used in this inquiry was to subject anatomically separated  parts of the organisms to chemical separations. The means for such  separations had to be more gentle than the strong heat and destructive  chemicals that had been considered adequate up to then. The  interpretation of the new results naturally relied on the general  advance of chemistry, the development of new methods for isolating  substances of little stability, of new concepts concerning the  arrangements of atoms in the molecules, and of new apparatus to measure  their rates of change.    In the system of chemistry, as it developed in the first half of the  19th century, the new development can be characterized as the turn from  inorganic to organic phosphates, from the substance of minerals and  strong chemical interactions to the components in which phosphate groups  remained combined with carbon-containing substances.
