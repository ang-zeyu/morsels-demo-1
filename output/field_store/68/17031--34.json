[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#3)"],[1," his experiments in gland-transplanting upon animals  in the year 1911, three years before the European War, using goats,  sheep, and guinea-pigs as his subjects. He ran beyond the limits of his  resources in this experimental work on animals, which was interrupted by  his enlistment in the army, and assignment to service as First  Lieutenant in the Medical Corps. Passed fit for Foreign Duty he was  nevertheless unable to get across to France, and remained, like many  another good surgeon, on duty in various southern camps.    Returning to civilian life he took up his quest again, varying a general  medical and surgical practice by continued observation and experiment in  gland-transplantations upon animals, leaning ever more strongly towards  the exclusive use of goats. About this time he heard of the work of  Professor Steinach of Vienna in grafting the glands of rats, and  producing changes in the character and appearance of the animals by  inverting the process of nature and transplanting male glands into  females, and vice versa, sometimes with success. He had followed with  the greatest interest also the experiments of Dr. Frank Lydston of  Chicago, who performed his first human-gland transplantation upon  himself, an example of courage that falls not far short of heroism. But  Dr. Brinkley was never favorably impressed with the idea of using the  glands of a human being for the renovation of the life-force of another  human being. He was looking to the young of the animal kingdom to  furnish him with the material he proposed to use to improve the  functioning of human organs, and more certainly as time passed he drew  to the conclusion that in the goat, and in the goat alone, was to be  found that gland-tissue which, because of its rapid maturity, potency,  and freedom from those diseases to which humanity is liable, was most  sure under right conditions of implantation to feed, nourish, grow into  and become a part of, human gland-tissue.    Later we will dwell a little upon some of his results. It is worthy of  note in passing that his first experiment upon a human being was an  unqualified success. He transplanted the goat-glands into a farmer who  was forty-six years of age, happily married, but childless, and one year  after the transplantation a child was born, who was christened \"Billy\"  in honor of the circumstances responsible for his birth. By patient  selection Dr. Brinkley has found that the Toggenburg breed of Swiss goat  gives him the best possible stock to use in his gland-work. This choice  was forced upon him by results obtained by the use of other breeds. He  found that the Toggenburg goat gave him best results because the animal,  besides its sound health, carries none of that persistent odor which is  peculiar to male goats the world over, and which, if shed abroad by a  human being would make his neighborhood unpleasant. He found that the  best age of the male goats whose glands were to be transplanted was from  three weeks to a month. He found that the best age at which to use the  ovaries of the female goat was one year, because, unlike its youthful  brother, the female goat's sex-activities are not developed before that  age.    His method of transplanting the glands into a man is by making two  incisions in the man's scrotum under simple local anesthesia,  a practically painless operation, but from this point on the technique  varies according to the conditions presented by the case. No two cases  are exactly alike, and Dr. Brinkley performs no two operations exactly  alike. That is the reason, he explains, why, with the best will in the  world to teach his fellow-practitioners what to do and how to do it, he  is nevertheless unable to state in writing exactly what treatment to use  to cover all cases. It cannot be taught by correspondence, and, simple  though it sounds to hear it, it cannot be learned by attendance at a few  clinics. It is delicate in this sense, that if it is not rightly  performed in the individual case the glands will slough. That means loss  of time, loss of temper, and the waste of a perfectly good pair of young  goat-glands. Another very important thing which his experiments have  taught Dr. Brinkley is this: the glands on being removed from the goat  must immediately be placed in a salt solution warmed to blood-heat, and  they must be used on the human being WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES from the time  they are taken from the goat. No such thing is possible as keeping these  glands in the refrigerator for twenty-four hours, or anything of that  kind, before using. The more quickly after removal from the animal they  are used the more likely they are to take hold and grow. In his men  cases he uses sometimes one gland, sometimes two; sometimes the whole  gland, just as it came from the young goat, sometimes a part of the  gland only, but he leans to the opinion that the gland of the  three-weeks-old goat gives best results if used entire, without  trimming. Sometimes he lays the gland +upon+ the outside of the human  testis, connecting part with part; sometimes he opens the testis by  incision and lays the goat-gland within the cleft. Very often there are  adhesions which must be broken down before the goat-gland can function  rightly. Very often there are unsuspected hydroceles, forming cysts in  the testicular mass, which must be cut out, or there may be varicocele  requiring attention. The patient suffers very slight inconvenience; the  local anesthetic is enough to dull the pain even of the breaking down of  the adhesions, so that it is at its worst no more than the pain of a  toothache, and lasts a very brief while. Many of the patients converse  with the doctor while the operation is proceeding. The pain is  negligible. The doctor proceeds according to the condition, age, etc.,  of his patient. He may ligate, that is to say, tie off, the tubes that  connect with one testis, or the other, or both; he may not ligate at  all. It will depend upon the result sought, the condition present, and  the age of the patient. Suppose the patient is an old man in whom it is  desired to produce rejuvenation; the doctor then will ligate both sides,  in order that the new glands when they take hold, and begin to feed the  testes of the man, stimulating these to a new activity, may not be  overtaxed to the point of excess usage by the patient when he returns  home and finds himself in possession of a sexual vigor that has been  unknown to him for many years. This increase in sexual vigor  +invariably+ follows, regardless of the age of the patient. The glowing  letters on file in the doctor's office attest this. Here, for instance,  is a letter from a man eighty-one years of age, who says, \"I feel like a  boy of eighteen. This is something I have not known for more than forty  years. The goat-glands have certainly done the work for me, but I wish,  doctor, you would fix it so that I could complete the sexual act,\" etc.,  etc.    But this completion of the sexual act is exactly the thing that is to be  avoided in the case of these old men. Remember the theory in the last  chapter, \"All animal energy is sex-energy.\" The conversion of this  sex-energy into other forms of energy, physical and mental, is the aim,  and this aim would be frustrated if these old men were given full power  to do as they pleased with their new-found youthful vigor. You cannot  always trust them. That is the purpose of the ligating of both sides,  making the emission of the semen impossible. The life-force, then,  having no other outlet, can do nothing else but reinvigorate the entire  system by pouring its precious fluids into the blood.    Suppose, now, the case is that of a man of fifty who is physically run  down, married, and anxious to be the father of a child. In such a case,  if the man is physically sound, Dr. Brinkley will do one of two things.  After the transplantation of the new glands he will either ligate one  side permanently, and allow one testis to carry on the work of  rejuvenation while the other can be used for procreation, or he will  ligate both sides and say to the man, \"I am tying off both testes  because you will need to rebuild for at least one year before you should  think of becoming a father. But I am ligating with linen thread, which  does not dissolve, and if you come back to me in one year from now I  will remove the ligatures, one or both, and you will then be able to  procreate.\" This is reasonable and wise talk, and the man makes no  objection. When the year of probation, as you might call it, has  expired, the man returns to the hospital, the ligature is removed, and  he goes home in a couple of days. These things are not fairy-tales, but  solid facts, amazing as they sound to you. There are five goat-gland  babies today among Dr. Brinkley's patients that he knows of, four boys  and one girl. There are probably many more of whom he has heard nothing,  for patients have a way of moving out of touch after awhile.          CHAPTER III    THE PRACTICE. WOMEN      At Dr. Brinkley's hospital, a beautifully appointed private residence,  it is a comfort to women patients to have the doctor's wife, herself a  competent surgeon if necessary, at hand during the actual operation.  Mrs. Brinkley administers the local anesthetic, or the general  anesthetic, if that is called for, as it sometimes is. While  the bulk of the operations performed on both men and women are  gland-transplantations, a diseased condition of tubes and ovaries has  sometimes made a laporotomy necessary, and many major operations have  been successfully performed in the white-enameled operating room.  At such times a woman clings to the presence of a woman, and Mrs.  Brinkley's kind and pleasant manner is usually sufficient to banish all  nervousness from the woman patient.    In ordinary cases of gland-transplantation into women, where the patient  is in good physical condition, with no disease of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2938"],[0,"Yeast (#3)"],[1,"kind to the torula would be killed, and by which the yeast plant is  killed, then the yeast loses its efficiency. But a capital experiment  upon this subject was made by a very distinguished man, Helmholz, who  performed an experiment of this kind. He had two vessels--one of them we  will suppose full of yeast, but over the bottom of it, as this might be,  was tied a thin film of bladder; consequently, through that thin film of  bladder all the liquid parts of the yeast would go, but the solid parts  would be stopped behind; the torula would be stopped, the liquid parts  of the yeast would go. And then he took another vessel containing a  fermentable solution of sugar, and he put one inside the other; and in  this way you see the fluid parts of the yeast were able to pass through  with the utmost ease into the sugar, but the solid parts could not get  through at all. And he judged thus: if the fluid parts are those which  excite fermentation, then, inasmuch as these are stopped, the sugar will  not ferment; and the sugar did not ferment, showing quite clearly,  that an immediate contact with the solid, living torula was absolutely  necessary to excite this process of splitting up of the sugar. This  experiment was quite conclusive as to this particular point, and has had  very great fruits in other directions.    Well, then, the yeast plant being essential to the production of  fermentation, where does the yeast plant come from? Here, again, was  another great problem opened up, for, as I said at starting, you have,  under ordinary circumstances in warm weather, merely to expose some  fluid containing a solution of sugar, or any form of syrup or vegetable  juice to the air, in order, after a comparatively short time, to see all  these phenomena of fermentation. Of course the first obvious suggestion  is, that the torula has been generated within the fluid. In fact, it  seems at first quite absurd to entertain any other conviction; but that  belief would most assuredly be an erroneous one.    Towards the beginning of this century, in the vigorous times of the old  French wars, there was a Monsieur Appert, who had his attention directed  to the preservation of things that ordinarily perish, such as meats and  vegetables, and in fact he laid the foundation of our modern method of  preserving meats; and he found that if he boiled any of these substances  and then tied them so as to exclude the air, that they would be  preserved for any time. He tried these experiments, particularly with  the must of wine and with the wort of beer; and he found that if the  wort of beer had been carefully boiled and was stopped in such a way  that the air could not get at it, it would never ferment. What was the  reason of this? That, again, became the subject of a long string of  experiments, with this ultimate result, that if you take precautions to  prevent any solid matters from getting into the must of wine or the wort  of beer, under these circumstances--that is to say, if the fluid has  been boiled and placed in a bottle, and if you stuff the neck of the  bottle full of cotton wool, which allows the air to go through and stops  anything of a solid character however fine, then you may let it be for  ten years and it will not ferment. But if you take that plug out and  give the air free access, then, sooner or later fermentation will set  up. And there is no doubt whatever that fermentation is excited only by  the presence of some torula or other, and that that torula proceeds in  our present experience, from pre-existing torulae. These little bodies  are excessively light. You can easily imagine what must be the weight of  little particles, but slightly heavier than water, and not more than the  two-thousandth or perhaps seven-thousandth of an inch in diameter. They  are capable of floating about and dancing like motes in the sunbeam;  they are carried about by all sorts of currents of air; the great  majority of them perish; but one or two, which may chance to enter into  a sugary solution, immediately enter into active life, find there the  conditions of their nourishment, increase and multiply, and may give  rise to any quantity whatever of this substance yeast. And, whatever  may be true or not be true about this \"spontaneous generation,\" as it  is called in regard to all other kinds of living things, it is perfectly  certain, as regards yeast, that it always owes its origin to this  process of transportation or inoculation, if you like so to call it,  from some other living yeast organism; and so far as yeast is concerned,  the doctrine of spontaneous generation is absolutely out of court.  And not only so, but the yeast must be alive in order to exert these  peculiar properties. If it be crushed, if it be heated so far that its  life is destroyed, that peculiar power of fermentation is not excited.  Thus we have come to this conclusion, as the result of our inquiry, that  the fermentation of sugar, the splitting of the sugar into alcohol and  carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid, is the result of nothing  but the vital activity of this little fungus, the torula.    And now comes the further exceedingly difficult inquiry--how is it  that this plant, the torula, produces this singular operation of the  splitting up of the sugar? Fabroni, to whom I referred some time ago,  imagined that the effervescence of fermentation was produced in just the  same way as the effervescence of a sedlitz powder, that the yeast was a  kind of acid, and that the sugar was a combination of carbonic acid and  some base to form the alcohol, and that the yeast combined with  this substance, and set free the carbonic acid; just as when you add  carbonate of soda to acid you turn out the carbonic acid. But of course  the discovery of Lavoisier that the carbonic acid and the alcohol taken  together are very nearly equal in weight to the sugar, completely upset  this hypothesis. Another view was therefore taken by the French chemist,  Thenard, and it is still held by a very eminent chemist, M. Pasteur, and  their view is this, that the yeast, so to speak, eats a little of the  sugar, turns a little of it to its own purposes, and by so doing gives  such a shape to the sugar that the rest of it breaks up into carbonic  acid and alcohol.    Well, then, there is a third hypothesis, which is maintained by another  very distinguished chemist, Liebig, which denies either of the other  two, and which declares that the particles of the sugar are, as it were,  shaken asunder by the forces at work in the yeast plant. Now I am not  going to take you into these refinements of chemical theory, I cannot  for a moment pretend to do so, but I may put the case before you by an  analogy. Suppose you compare the sugar to a card house, and suppose you  compare the yeast to a child coming near the card house, then Fabroni's  hypothesis was that the child took half the cards away; Thenard's and  Pasteur's hypothesis is that the child pulls out the bottom card and  thus makes it tumble to pieces; and Liebig's hypothesis is that the  child comes by and shakes the table and tumbles the house down. I  appeal to my friend here (Professor Roscoe) whether that is not a fair  statement of the case.    Having thus, as far as I can, discussed the general state of the  question, it remains only that I should speak of some of those  collateral results which have come in a very remarkable way out of the  investigation of yeast. I told you that it was very early observed that  the yeast plant consisted of a bag made up of the same material as that  which composes wood, and of an interior semifluid mass which contains  a substance, identical in its composition, in a broad sense, with  that which constitutes the flesh of animals. Subsequently, after  the structure of the yeast plant had been carefully observed, it was  discovered that all plants, high and low, are made up of separate  bags or \"cells,\" as they are called; these bags or cells having the  composition of the pure matter of wood; having the same composition,  broadly speaking, as the sac of the yeast plant, and having in their  interior a more or less fluid substance containing a matter of the same  nature as the protein substance of the yeast plant. And therefore this  remarkable result came out--that however much a plant may differ from  an animal, yet that the essential constituent of the contents of these  various cells or sacs of which the plant is made up, the nitrogenous  protein matter, is the same in the animal as in the plant. And not only  was this gradually discovered, but it was found that these semifluid  contents of the plant cell had, in many cases, a remarkable power of  contractility quite like that of the substance of animals. And about  24 or 25 years ago, namely, about the year 1846, to the best of my  recollection, a very eminent German botanist, Hugo Von Mohl, conferred  upon this substance which is found in the interior of the plant cell,  and which is identical with the matter found in the inside of the yeast  cell, and which again contains an animal substance similar to that of  which we ourselves are made up--he conferred upon this that title of  \"protoplasm,\" which has brought other people a great deal of trouble  since! I beg particularly to say that, because I find many people  suppose that I was the inventor of that term, whereas it has been in  existence for at least twenty-five years. And then other observers,  taking the question up, came to this astonishing conclusion (working  from this basis of the yeast), that the differences between animals and  plants are not so much in the fundamental substances which compose them,  not in the protoplasm, but in the manner in which the cells of which  their bodies are built up have become modified. There is a sense in  which it is true--and the analogy was pointed out very many years ago by  some French botanists and chemists--there is a"]]]
