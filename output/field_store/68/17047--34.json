I didn't--not until just now. But, yes, that's when  it started. I'd never minded the dark or being alone, but I was  frightened when Mother shut the door that night, because the walls  seemed so ... so solid, now that I knew all the thoughts I used to  think were with me there were just pretend. When I finally went to  sleep, I dreamed, and I went on having the same dream, night after  night after night, until finally they called a doctor and he gave me  something to make me sleep.\"    \"I wish they'd called me,\" Dr. Andrews said.    \"What could you have done? The sleeping pills worked, anyway, and  after a while I didn't need them any more, because I'd heard other  kids talking about having hunches and lucky streaks and I stopped  feeling different from the rest of them, except once in a while, when  I was so lucky it ... bothered me.\"    \"And after you met Paul, you stopped being ... too lucky ... and the  dream stopped?\"    \"No!\" Lucilla was startled at her own vehemence. \"No, it wasn't like  that at all, and you'd know it, if you'd been listening. With Paul, I  felt close to him all the time, no matter how many miles or walls or  anything else there were between us. We hardly had to talk at all,  because we seemed to know just what the other one was thinking all the  time, listening to music, or watching the waves pound in or just  working together at the office. Instead of feeling ... odd ... when I  knew what he was thinking or what he was going to say, I felt good  about it, because I was so sure it was the same way with him and what  I was thinking. We didn't talk about it. There just wasn't any need  to.\" She lapsed into silence again. Dr. Andrews straightened her  clenched hand out and stroked the fingers gently. After a moment, she  went on.    \"He hadn't asked me to marry him, but I knew he would, and there wasn't  any hurry, because everything was so perfect, anyway. Then one of the  company's clients decided to sponsor a series of fantasy shows on TV and  wanted us to tie in the ads for next year with the fantasy theme. Paul was  assigned to the account, and G.G. let him borrow me to work on it, because  it was such a rush project. I'd always liked fairy stories when I was  little and when I discovered there were grown-up ones, too, like those in  _Unknown Worlds_ and the old _Weird Tales_, I read them, too.  But I hadn't any idea how much there was, until we started buying copies  of everything there was on the news-stands, and then ransacking musty  little stores for back issues and ones that had gone out of publication,  until Paul's office was just full of teetery piles of gaudy magazines and  everywhere you looked there were pictures of strange stars and  eight-legged monsters and men in space suits.\"    \"So what do the magazines have to do with you and Paul?\"    \"The way he felt about them changed everything. He just laughed at the  ones about space ships and other planets and robots and things, but he  didn't laugh when came across stories about ... well, mutants, and  people with talents....\"    \"Talents? Like reading minds, you mean?\"    She nodded, not looking at him. \"He didn't laugh at those. He acted as  if they were ... well, indecent. The sort of thing you wouldn't be  caught dead reading in public. And he thought that way, too,  especially about the stories that even mentioned telepathy. At first,  when he brought them to my attention in that disapproving way, I  thought he was just pretending to sneer, to tease me, because  he--we--knew they could be true. Only his thoughts matched his  remarks. He hated the stories, Dr. Andrews, and was just determined to  have me hate them, too. All at once I began to feel as if I didn't  know him at all and I began to wonder if I'd just imagined everything  all those months I felt so close to him. And then I began to dream  again, and to think about that lonesome silent world even when I was  wide awake.\"    \"Go on, Lucilla,\" Dr. Andrews said, as she hesitated.    \"That's all, just about. We finished the job and got rid of the  magazines and for a little while it was almost as if those two weeks  had never been, except I couldn't forget that he didn't know what I  was thinking at all, even when everything he did, almost, made it seem  as if he did. It began to seem wrong for me to know what he was  thinking. Crazy, like Mother had said, and worse, somehow. Not well,  not even nice, if you know what I mean.\"    \"Then he asked you to marry him.\"    \"And I said no, even when I wanted, oh, so terribly, to say yes and  yes and yes.\" She squeezed her eyes tight shut to hold back a rush of  tears.           *       *       *       *       *    Time folded back on itself. Once again, the hands of her wristwatch  pointed to 4:30 and the white-clad receptionist said briskly, \"Doctor  will see you now.\" Once again, from some remote vantage point, Lucilla  watched herself brush past Dr. Andrews and cross to the familiar  couch, heard herself say, \"It's getting worse,\" watched herself move  through a flickering montage of scenes from childhood to womanhood,  from past to present.    She opened he eyes to meet those of the man who sat patiently beside  her. \"You see,\" he said, \"telling me wasn't so difficult, after all.\"  And then, before she had decided on a response, \"What do you know  about Darwin's theory of evolution, Lucilla?\"    His habit of ending a tense moment by making an irrelevant query no  longer even startled her. Obediently, she fumbled for an answer. \"Not  much. Just that he thought all the different kinds of life on earth  today evolved from a few blobs of protoplasm that sprouted wings or  grew fur or developed teeth, depending on when they lived, and where.\"  She paused hopefully, but met with only silence. \"Sometimes what  seemed like a step forward wasn't,\" she said, ransacking her brain for  scattered bits of information. \"Then the species died out, like the  saber-tooth tiger, with those tusks that kept right on growing until  they locked his jaws shut, so he starved to death.\" As she spoke, she  remembered the huge beast as he had been pictured in one of her  college textbooks. The recollection grew more and more vivid, until  she could see both the picture and the facing page of text. There was  an irregularly shaped inkblot in the upper corner and several heavily  underlined sentences that stood out so distinctly she could actually  read the words. \"According to Darwin, variations in general are not  infinitesimal, but in the nature of specific mutations. Thousands of  these occur, but only the fittest survive the climate, the times,  natural enemies, and their own kind, who strive to perpetuate  themselves unchanged.\" Taken one by one, the words were all  familiar--taken as a whole, they made no sense at all. She let the  book slip unheeded from her mind and stared at Dr. Andrews in  bewilderment.    \"Try saying it in a different way.\"    \"You sound like a school teacher humoring a stupid child.\" And then,  because of the habit of obedience was strong, \"I guess he meant that  tails didn't grow an inch at a time, the way the dog's got cut off,  but all at once ... like a fish being born with legs as well as fins,  or a baby saber-tooth showing up among tigers with regular teeth, or  one ape in a tribe discovering he could swing down out of the treetops  and stand erect and walk alone.\"    He echoed her last words. \"And walk alone....\" A premonitory chill  traced its icy way down Lucilla's backbone. For a second she stood on  gray moss, under a gray sky, in the midst of a gray silence. \"He not  only could walk alone, he had to. Do you remember what your book  said?\"    \"Only the fittest survive,\" Lucilla said numbly. \"Because they have to  fight the climate ... and their natural enemies ... and their own  kind.\" She swung her feet to the floor and pushed herself into a  sitting position. \"I'm not a ... a mutation. I'm not, I'm not, I'm  NOT, and you can't say I am, because I won't listen!\"    \"I didn't say you were.\" There was the barest hint of emphasis on the  first word. Lucilla was almost certain she heard a whisper of  laughter, but he met her gaze blandly, his expression completely  serious.    \"Don't you dare laugh!\" she said, nonetheless. \"There's nothing funny  about ... about....\"    \"About being able to read people's minds,\" Dr Andrews said helpfully.  \"You'd much rather have me offer some other explanation for the  occurrences that bother you so--is that it?\"    \"I guess so. Yes, it is. A brain tumor. Or schizophrenia. Or anything  at all that could maybe be cured, so I could marry Paul and have  children and be like everybody else. Like you.\" She looked past him to  the picture on his desk. \"It's easy for you to talk.\"    He ignored the last statement. \"Why can't you get married, anyway?\"    \"You've already said why. Because Paul would hate me--everybody would  hate me--if they knew I was different.\"    \"How would they know? It doesn't show. Now if you had three legs, or a  long bushy tail, or outsized teeth....\"    Lucilla smiled involuntarily, and then was furious at herself for  doing so and at Dr Andrews for provoking her into it. \"This whole  thing is utterly asinine, anyhow. Here we are, talking as if I might  really be a mutant, and you know perfectly well that I'm not.\"    \"Do I? You made the diagnosis, Lucilla, and you've given me some  mighty potent reasons for believing it ... can you give me equally  good reasons for doubting that you're a telepath?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The peremptory demand left Lucilla speechless for a moment. She groped  blindly for an answer, then almost laughed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#3)"],[1,"an expedition to assist  the Cretan insurgents against the Turks. Between the two men it was  arranged that MacIver should precede the expedition to Crete and  prepare for its arrival. The Cretans received him gladly, and from the  provisional government he received a commission in which he was given  \"full power to make war on land and sea against the enemies of Crete,  and particularly against the Sultan of Turkey and the Turkish forces,  and to burn, destroy, or capture any vessel bearing the Turkish flag.\"    This permission to destroy the Turkish navy single-handed strikes one  as more than generous, for the Cretans had no navy, and before one could  begin the destruction of a Turkish gun-boat it was first necessary to  catch it and tie it to a wharf.    At the close of the Cretan insurrection MacIver crossed to Athens and  served against the brigands in Kisissia on the borders of Albania  and Thessaly as volunteer aide to Colonel Corroneus, who had been  commander-in-chief of the Cretans against the Turks. MacIver spent three  months potting at brigands, and for his services in the mountains was  recommended for the highest Greek decoration.    From Greece it was only a step to New York, and almost immediately  MacIver appears as one of the Goicouria-Christo expedition to Cuba,  of which Goicouria was commander-in-chief, and two famous American  officers, Brigadier-General Samuel C. Williams was a general and Colonel  Wright Schumburg was chief of staff.    In the scrap-book I find \"General Order No. 11 of the Liberal Army of  the Republic of Cuba, issued at Cedar Keys, October 3, 1869.\" In it  Colonel MacIver is spoken of as in charge of officers not attached to  any organized corps of the division. And again:    \"General Order No. V, Expeditionary Division, Republic of Cuba, on board  _Lilian_,\" announces that the place to which the expedition is bound has  been changed, and that General Wright Schumburg, who now is in command,  orders \"all officers not otherwise commissioned to join Colonel  MacIver's 'Corps of Officers.'\"    The _Lilian_ ran out of coal, and to obtain firewood put in at Cedar  Keys. For two weeks the patriots cut wood and drilled upon the beach,  when they were captured by a British gun-boat and taken to Nassau.  There they were set at liberty, but their arms, boat, and stores were  confiscated.    In a sailing vessel MacIver finally reached Cuba, and under Goicouria,  who had made a successful landing, saw some \"help yourself\" fighting.  Goicouria's force was finally scattered, and MacIver escaped from the  Spanish soldiery only by putting to sea in an open boat, in which he  endeavored to make Jamaica.    On the third day out he was picked up by a steamer and again landed at  Nassau, from which place he returned to New York.    At that time in this city there was a very interesting man named  Thaddeus P. Mott, who had been an officer in our army and later  had entered the service of Ismail Pasha. By the Khedive he had  been appointed a general of division and had received permission to  reorganize the Egyptian army.    His object in coming to New York was to engage officers for that  service. He came at an opportune moment. At that time the city was  filled with men who, in the Rebellion, on one side or the other, had  held command, and many of these, unfitted by four years of soldiering  for any other calling, readily accepted the commissions which Mott had  authority to offer. New York was not large enough to keep MacIver and  Mott long apart, and they soon came to an understanding. The agreement  drawn up between them is a curious document. It is written in a neat  hand on sheets of foolscap tied together like a Commencement-day  address, with blue ribbon. In it MacIver agrees to serve as colonel of  cavalry in the service of the Khedive. With a few legal phrases omitted,  the document reads as follows:    \"Agreement entered into this 24th day of March, 1870, between the  Government of his Royal Highness and the Khedive of Egypt, represented  by General Thaddeus P. Mott of the first part, and H. R. H. MacIver of  New York City.    \"The party of the second part, being desirous of entering into the  service of party of the first part, in the military capacity of a  colonel of cavalry, promises to serve and obey party of the first part  faithfully and truly in his military capacity during the space of five  years from this date; that the party of the second part waives all  claims of protection usually afforded to Americans by consular and  diplomatic agents of the United States, and expressly obligates himself  to be subject to the orders of the party of the first part, and to make,  wage, and vigorously prosecute war against any and all the enemies of  party of the first part; that the party of the second part will not  under any event be governed, controlled by, or submit to, any order,  law, mandate, or proclamation issued by the Government of the United  States of America, forbidding party of the second part to serve party  of the first part to make war according to any of the provisions herein  contained, _it being, however, distinctly understood_ that nothing  herein contained shall be construed as obligating party of the second  part to bear arms or wage war against the United States of America.    \"Party of the first part promises to furnish party of the second part  with horses, rations, and pay him for his services the same salary now  paid to colonels of cavalry in United States army, and will furnish him  quarters suitable to his rank in army. Also promises, in the case of  illness caused by climate, that said party may resign his office and  shall receive his expenses to America and two months' pay; that he  receives one-fifth of his regular pay during his active service,  together with all expenses of every nature attending such enterprise.\"    It also stipulates as to what sums shall be paid his family or children  in case of his death.    To this MacIver signs this oath:    \"In the presence of the ever-living God, I swear that I will in all  things honestly, faithfully, and truly keep, observe, and perform the  obligations and promises above enumerated, and endeavor to conform to  the wishes and desires of the Government of his Royal Highness, the  Khedive of Egypt, in all things connected with the furtherance of his  prosperity, and the maintenance of his throne.\"    On arriving at Cairo, MacIver was appointed inspector-general of  cavalry, and furnished with a uniform, of which this is a description:  \"It consisted of a blue tunic with gold spangles, embroidered in gold  up the sleeves and front, neat-fitting red trousers, and high  patent-leather boots, while the inevitable fez completed the gay  costume.\"    The climate of Cairo did not agree with MacIver, and, in spite of  his \"gay costume,\" after six months he left the Egyptian service. His  honorable discharge was signed by Stone Bey, who, in the favor of the  Khedive, had supplanted General Mott.    It is a curious fact that, in spite of his ill health, immediately after  leaving Cairo, MacIver was sufficiently recovered to at once plunge into  the Franco-Prussian War. At the battle of Orleans, while on the staff  of General Chanzy, he was wounded. In this war his rank was that of a  colonel of cavalry of the auxiliary army.    His next venture was in the Carlist uprising of 1873, when he formed a  Carlist League, and on several occasions acted as bearer of important  messages from the \"King,\" as Don Carlos was called, to the sympathizers  with his cause in France and England.    MacIver was promised, if he carried out successfully a certain mission  upon which he was sent, and if Don Carlos became king, that he would be  made a marquis. As Don Carlos is still a pretender, MacIver is still a  general. Although in disposing of his sword MacIver never allowed his  personal predilections to weigh with him, he always treated himself to a  hearty dislike of the Turks, and we next find him fighting against them  in Herzegovina with the Montenegrins. And when the Servians declared  war against the same people, MacIver returned to London to organize a  cavalry brigade to fight with the Servian army.    Of this brigade and of the rapid rise of MacIver to highest rank and  honors in Servia, the scrap-book is most eloquent. The cavalry brigade  was to be called the Knights of the Red Cross.    In a letter to the editor of the _Hour_, the general himself speaks of  it in the following terms:    \"It may be interesting to many of your readers to learn that a select  corps of gentlemen is at present in course of organization under  the above title with the mission of proceeding to the Levant to  take measures in case of emergency for the defense of the Christian  population, and more especially of British subjects who are to a great  extent unprovided with adequate means of protection from the religious  furies of the Mussulmans. The lives of Christian women and children are  in hourly peril from fanatical hordes. The Knights will be carefully  chosen and kept within strict military control, and will be under  command of a practical soldier with large experience of the Eastern  countries. Templars and all other crusaders are invited to give aid and  sympathy.\"    Apparently MacIver was not successful in enlisting many Knights, for  a war correspondent at the capital of Servia, waiting for the war to  begin, writes as follows:    \"A Scotch soldier of fortune, Henry MacIver, a colonel by rank, has  arrived at Belgrade with a small contingent of military adventurers.  Five weeks ago I met him in Fleet Street, London, and had some talk  about his 'expedition.' He had received a commission from the Prince of  Servia to organize and command an independent cavalry brigade, and he  then was busily enrolling his volunteers into a body styled 'The Knights  of the Red Cross.' I am afraid some of his bold crusaders have earned "]]]
