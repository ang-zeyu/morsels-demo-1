The color pattern consists of three black or deep brown  stripes on the dorsal part of the head, one mid-dorsally, and one on  each side of the head passing through the eye. On the body, there are  usually dark longitudinal stripes on a pale tan or white background.  There may be as few as three in _vittatus_, and as many as 13 in _l.  dunni_; except that there is none in _C. l. concolor_. There are two  pairs of primary dark stripes. The first is the body stripe that is  the posterior extension of the stripe which on the head passes through  the eye and is termed the lateral stripe. The other primary stripe is  the posterior continuation of the mid-dorsal head stripe. Usually it  is split into two dorsolateral stripes on the body. Stripes may be  present on the scale-row to either side of the primary stripe. These  stripes are usually dark brown or black and are the secondary stripes.  Finally, additional stripes may be present that are paler brown and  bear no direct relationship to the primary stripes. These are  auxiliary stripes.    Every stripe originates either as broad continuous stripe or as a row  of spots or dashes, forming a discontinuous stripe, which in some  specimens becomes continuous posteriorly. The stripes are usually  black or deep brown, although auxiliary stripes are sometimes paler.  The dorsal ground color is pale brown, tan, olive, or white; usually  the ground color is palest ventrally and darkest dorsally.    In some specimens of _Conophis_ the lateral tips of the ventrals are  spotted, one spot on each end of each ventral. Otherwise, the ventrals  are immaculate white.    In some species there is considerable ontogenetic change in color  pattern, although the juveniles bear the basic color characteristics  of the adults. For example, juveniles of the sympatric species _C.  lineatus dunni_ and _C. pulcher_ can be separated on the basis of  which scale-rows are darkly pigmented. _C. l. dunni_ has eight stripes  in juveniles and as many as 13 in adults. Juveniles show a greater  contrast between the black stripes and the pale ground color than do  adults. With increased age (size) the stripes in some populations  become paler and are split; simultaneously the ground color becomes  darker.      Sexual Dimorphism    Sexual dimorphism is evident in all species and subspecies of  _Conophis_. Differences always exist in the number of subcaudals and  in the tail/body ratio; males have more subcaudals and relatively  longer tails than do females (table 3). Otherwise, there is little  sexual dimorphism in these snakes. Males and females cannot be  differentiated by any feature of coloration.    Formulation of a biological concept of the species as defined by Mayr  (1942) is difficult when most of the data primarily relied upon are  from preserved specimens. Nevertheless, a total view of variation was  attempted so that differences within and between populations could be  recognized. Differences, between populations, that seem to be part of  a continuous or internal cline (Huxley, 1942) are not used for  characterizing subspecies.       [Illustration: FIG. 1.

One hundred and  seven specimens have 157 to 178 (164.8) ventrals. Eighty-eight of  these snakes having complete tails have 56 to 80 (68.0) subcaudals;  the number of ventrals plus subcaudals varies from 222 to 247 (233.5)  in 87 of these. On 107 specimens the reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal  scale-rows takes place between ventrals 89 and 114 (101.8). Sexual  dimorphism is evident in the number of subcaudals; there are, on the  average, fewer subcaudals in females than in males of each subspecies.  The largest specimen is a male _C. l. concolor_ (USNM 46345) from  Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico, having a body length of 893 mm., a tail  length of 274 mm. and a total length of 1167 mm. The smallest is a  juvenile _C. l. dunni_ (MCZ 49749) from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, having  a body length of 162 mm., a tail length of 51 mm. and a total length  of 213 mm.    The greatest variation is in coloration. Dark color, or lack thereof,  has been used to separate the subspecies of _C. lineatus_. The  ground-color is pale brown, pale olive or white, either with no  stripes on the body or with eight to thirteen dark stripes at  mid-body. Specimens having dark stripes on the body always have black  or dark brown pigmentation on the first, 4th and 7th dorsal  scale-rows. In some there is dark pigmentation on the 2nd, 3rd, 8th  and 10th rows of scales. The stripes appear on the nape or farther  posteriorly, usually on the anterior third of the body, either as a  series of spots or dashes that form a continuous stripe farther  posteriorly or as a continuous stripe.    The ventrals usually have more or less conspicuous dark spots  laterally on those specimens having dark stripes present on the  dorsum; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37530"],[0,"The Story of an Ostrich: An Allegory and Humorous Satire in Rhyme.

The judges, thrown now on their own wisdom, turned      To next take account of how much they had learned;      The peacock, as chairman, assuming dominion,      Invited from each a judicial opinion;      Whereupon, in his turn, each his own views expressed,      Then sat down and looked around, wise, at the rest.        The fox was the first to arise to his feet,      To announce that his own mind was made up complete;    [Illustration]        He seized the occasion his own reputation      To clear of a cloud of ill-got defamation      Alleging that he had habitually crept      Round henroosts, at midnight, when honest folk slept;      Which libel had darkened his whole life's existence,      And made it much harder to gain a subsistence;      He thought it a shame that a poor tempted sinner,      Like him, should thus suffer for getting his dinner.        While he spake, his eyes rested, in manner abiding,      Upon the slim neck of the peacock presiding,      Which ruffled its feathers and spread out its tail,      Though feeling itself round the gills growing pale.        The next to express an opinion, invoked      By the peacock presiding, the toad gruffly croaked      His belief that beneath stillest tongue there lay hid,      Most often, the softest and tenderest quid;      For his part, he thought that the ostrich inclined      To lay too much stress on his power of mind;      But there are those who work as well as preach, and to such may yet be  recorded the service of universal peace.      _VII._    In solemn convocation met, stand the mighty men of our realm, with the  policy of the bull, of the bear, of the wolf and of the fox, each  animal, according to the nature of its disposition, awaiting the  opportunity of power and spoliation, by which he may grasp and hold to  himself, as his own personal increment, all that can be wrested from the  state and humanity at large. The state, itself, in principle wise,  majestic and supreme, petitions peace of the leering devil, who  constantly juggles with the tape of human selfishness, as waiting angels  record the devious courses that nations and individuals take.    Behold, how pressed on all sides is the man of the hour in the grasp of  the huge, overbrooding, material powers of self-interest.      _VIII._    Confusion still reigns, but labor has risen from the cross and comes to  legislation. He dreams of conquests that are chimerical, where the  shadowy knight of honor contests the field with the disgruntled spirit  of melancholy, who pessimistically broods the unhatched egg of  arbitration. Agitators and agitations still hold sway, while Satan in  their midst dominates the human idea of progress and reform with the  accursed principle of Self, that is in itself Self-destroying.      _IX._    When, now, the monster spirit of protest begins to show its gigantic  figure, high, low, and middle classes are alarmed. Prices fluctuate,  business goes down, work and bread are scarce. Behold, in the heavens  appear the gruesome phantoms of war. But so far, in every crisis,  messengers from worlds beyond have sanctified the impending woe to the  world's welfare.    The tides of progress are in the hands of the Infinite, who measures  from cycle to cycle their ebb and flow; while the ever rising tide-mark  signifies the ultimate inundation of the millenium. How great is God!  How small is man in his own councils!      _X._    By the loss of men and money mighty men are upset, and the wise among  them are made to look grave. In      [Illustration]        Its all very well for them as can do it,      To strive after learning and try to construe it,      But an ostrich's presumption is, clearly, mere shoddy,      His head is too small for the size of his body.\"        The snail next emerged from his shell, to announce      His opinion, in words he could scarcely pronounce;      He spake without grace and his voice was not strong,      While his sentences dragged themselves slowly along;      \"An estredge,\" he said, \"is er monstrus big creeter,      Who'd kill you all dead, as you'd kill er muskeeter;      Ef he stepped his gret foot on your body and shell,      I'm sure you would never, again, feel so well;\"      The snail then withdrew to his shell's deep recesses,      With the same staid demeanor he ever possesses.        The hatter essayed, now, to speak, in his turn,      In serious words, that evinced his concern,      Lest justice miscarry and leave their decision      A subject for mirth, if not open derision.    [Illustration]        \"My friends,\" he began, \"I'm pleased with your brevity,      But you treat the matter with far too much levity;      Its plainly the duty of those of our station,      To recomend that which deserves commendation;\"        \"The world is a large one, and all who are in it      Should join in this principle, this very minute,--      That nature, or Providence, made no mistake      In giving an ostrich a head that will ache,      In order that when he slips off from his trolley,      Some well sustained kicks may reveal him his folly.\"        \"I perceive in this case a well defined principle,--      Divinely appointed, eternal, invincible,--      To wit,--adaptation of means to an end,      By reason of which, all effect and cause blend,--      Which gave the dumb feet an integument bony,      To travel in dirt and o'er ground rough and stony,      And set in the head, held aloft in the main,      The delicate eye for the convolute brain,      the day of judgment, in the overturning of the kingdom and principles of  the world they inhabit, no one knows what to think. Apprehension and  gloom are on all the faces that meet in the populous thoroughfares of  trade; but the public school, the pen, and the power of the press have  so raised the standard of common intelligence, that there is a steady  advance and progress, animated by its inspiring, though still shackled  Spirit of Protest. It has entered of its own volition into the service  which makes for the unity of powers working jointly in Heaven and upon  the earth, and our beautiful flag shows only the transfigured light of  the stars.      _XI._    To separate the head from the feet, labor from capital, or to inaugurate  war between them, brings about such confusion and distress as can only  be likened to the great body of humanity being continually brewed by  Satan in an enormous caldron kept hot by the fires of revolution. All  evil being ultimate good, the process, though one of renovation and  purification, is bitterly painful to the innocent as well as to the  guilty. In the determined revolt of the feet of humanity against the  head, it has always been discovered that the head was too small for the  size of the body; and that the bulky feet carry with them, when aroused  to action along the lines of self-defence, a tremendous barbaric force  and cruelty. Witness the fearful revolts of society that have brought  the issue to a test. In the cosmical alembic of human jurisprudence,  there must be mixed with lofty and divine sentiments a recognition of  our mutual dependence and accountability, not of man to man, only, but  to something higher than his humanity, a perfect and divine law to which  that humanity may be harmoniously attuned. God, dominant in love that is  not calculating, but universal and free as the air we breathe and  without taint of prejudice, can alone amalgamate the differences of  these varying tones,--wielding them together into a perfectly melodious  theme.    He is, indeed, the tuning fork that shall put the instruments into  perfect tune.      _XII._    The age has reached a point of reason so far as councils may serve to  settle the differences between the head and the feet; and the waiting  world stands with attentive ear      [Illustration]        To detect at a distance impending disaster,      Fulfilling the duties assigned to the master,      Of guiding the feet toward smooth paths, every day,      And making as easy as may be their way.\"        The peacock had listened with bated emotion,      While each indicated and stated his notion;      But when they were done, he screeched out with a flout,      \"You, none of you, know what you're talking about!\"      With which allegation he gravely begun      To strut up and down, back and forth, in the sun,      And spread out his frail and great, glimmering tail,      Till it shone like a beautiful, shimmering veil.        \"Excuse me,\" he said, in tones harsh and discordant,      Ill-concealing a feeling sarcastic and mordant      That listeners all noted, \"if, I implore you,      I perambulate gorgeously round here before you,      To show you that beauty of plumage and figure      Have nothing in common with prosaic vigor;    [Illustration]        Creation, which wisely decreed that the feet      Were made to be used in the dust of the street,      Has, also, ordained that they shall sustain      Superior cellular tissue and brain      Above and away from the gross things of earth,--      Evincing, thereby, a superlative birth;      And why should I be, then, so terribly blamed,      If I, of my feet, am a good deal ashamed;\"      As he ended, the floor of the sand-pit he spurned,      And abruptly announced arbitration adjourned.        Although no agreement was reached, as a whole,      Discussion is generally good for the soul;      The ostrich, ere adjudication was through,      Unconsciously passing his acts in review,      Had arrived, independently, at the decision,      That he'd been a fool; and he laughed in derision,      To think he'd permitted his weak self-conceit,      To lead him to pecking his own faithful feet.      to hear the judgment of such councils of mankind; great and small are  its representatives, and"]]]
