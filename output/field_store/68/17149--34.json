Each of you shall have a share.\"    The king took up the sack nearest to him, their surprise, when out  rushed a great heap of brown leaves, which flew all over the floor and  half choked them with dust! When the king saw this he growled with  rage and looked at the fairies with a dark frown on his face. They  begged him to look at the next sack, but when he did so, it, too, was  full of brown leaves, instead of gold and precious stones. This was  too much for King Winter's patience. He tossed the bags one by one out  of the palace window, and would have tossed the unlucky fairies after  them, had not some of the bravest ones knelt down and asked for mercy,  telling him they had obeyed his orders, and, if King Frost had taken  back his treasure, they were not to blame.    This turned their master's anger against King Frost, and very angry  and fierce he was. He gnashed his great teeth with rage and rushed up  and down in his palace, until it shook again. At last he made up his  mind to go out that night, break down King Frost's beautiful palace,  and take away all his riches.    When night came, he started out with all his fairies. Some were armed  with the clubs they had beaten off the leaves with, and others had  lumps of ice to throw at their enemy; but the king had been so angry  all day that he had not told them what to do; also, he had left their  sharp spears locked up. He wrapped himself in his great white cloak of  swan's down in order that he might look very grand, and so they went  on their way.    King Frost lived on the other side of the wood, and he had heard all  the noise made by the winter fairies in spoiling the trees and had  seen the next morning the mischief they had done. It made him very  sorry to find the beautiful leaves all knocked off and taken away, and  he determined to punish King Winter by going to attack _his_ palace  that night. He spent the day making ready and dressing himself and his  servants in shining coats of ice-armour and giving each one several  spears and darts of ice tipped with sharp diamond points. They looked  like brave little soldiers.    The two groups of fairies met in the midst of the great wood. After  some words between the kings, their servants fell to blows and a  great battle they had. The winter fairies fought with their clubs and  threw lumps of ice at the frost fairies; but their clubs were weak  from being used so roughly the night before and soon broke; and when  their ice-balls were all thrown away they could find no more. But King  Frost had armed his servants well, and they threw their icy darts  among the winter fairies. The trees, too, seemed to fight on the Frost  King's side. The bare twigs pulled their hair and the branches ripped  their ice clothes wherever they could. So the winter fairies had the  worst of it and at last started off at full speed and rushed through  the woods, never stopping till they reached the palace, and shut  themselves in--leaving their king, who was too proud to run, all alone  with King Frost and his fairies. You may be sure they were not very  merciful to him. They began to pull his cloak, calling out, \"Give us  your cloak to keep our trees warm. You stole their pretty leaves; you  must give us your cloak.\"    Now this was a magic cloak and had been given to King Winter by the  Queen of the fairies, so when he felt them pulling at it, he wrapped  it tightly about him, and began to run. After him flew the frost  fairies, pulling and plucking at his great white cloak, snatching out  a bit here and a bit there and laughing and shouting while King Winter  howled and roared and rushed along, not knowing where he went. On they  flew up and down the wood in and out among the trees,--their way  marked by the scattered bits of white down from King Winter's cloak.  When day began King Winter found himself near his own palace. He  dashed his tattered cloak to the ground and rushed through the gate,  shaking his fist at King Frost.    He and his fairies took the cloak. As they went home through the woods  they hung beautiful wreaths of white down on all the trees and also  trimmed the branches with their broken spears and darts, which shone  like silver in the sunlight, and made the woods look as bright almost,  as before it had been robbed of its golden and ruby leaves. Even the  ground was covered with shining darts and white feathers. Every one  thought it very beautiful, and no one could tell how it happened.

Come, see the north wind's masonry.      Out of an unseen quarry evermore      Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer      Curves his white bastions with projected roof      Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.      Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work      So fanciful, so savage, naught cares he      For number or proportion. Mockingly,      On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;      A swanlike form invests the hidden thorn;      Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,      Mauger the farmer's sighs; and at the gate      A tapering turret overtops the work.      And when his hours are numbered, and the world      Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,      Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art      To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone--      Built in an age, the mad wind's night work,      The frolic architecture of the snow.                            Ralph Waldo Emerson.          THE FIRST WINTER    (Iroquois Legend)      There was a time when the days were always of the same length, and it  was always summer. The red men lived continually in the smile of the  Great Spirit and were happy. But there arose a chief who was so  powerful that he at last declared himself mightier than the Great  Spirit, and taught his brothers to go forth to the plain and mock him.  They would call upon the Great Spirit to come and fight with them or  would challenge him to take away the crop of growing corn or drive the  game from the woods. They would say he was an unkind father to keep  himself and their dead brothers in the Happy Hunting Grounds, where  the red men could hunt forever without weariness.    They laughed at their old men who had feared for so many moons to  reproach the Great Spirit for his unfair treatment of the Indians who  were compelled to hunt and fish for game for their wives and children,  while their own women had to plant the corn and harvest it.    \"In the Happy Hunting Grounds,\" they said, \"the Great Spirit feeds our  brothers and their wives and does not let any foes or dangers come  upon them, but here he lets us go hungry many times. If he is as great  as you have said, why does he not take care of his children here?\"    Then the Great Spirit told them he would turn his smiling face away  from them, so that they should have no more light and warmth and they  must build fires in the forest if they would see.    But the red men laughed and taunted him, telling him that he had  followed one trail so long that he could not get out of it, but would  have to come every day and give them light and heat as usual. Then  they would dance and make faces at him and taunt him with his  helplessness.    In a few days the quick eyes of some of the red men saw in the morning  the face of the Great Spirit appear where it was not wont to appear,  but they were silent, fearing the jibes of their brothers. Finally,  duller eyes noticed the change, and alarm and consternation spread  among the people. Each day brought less and less of the Great Spirit's  smile and his countenance was often hidden by dark clouds, while  terrible storms beat upon the frightened faces turned in appeal toward  the heavens. The strong braves and warriors became as women; the old  men covered their heads with skins and starved in the forests; while  the women in their lodges crooned the low, mournful wail of the death  song. Frosts and snows came upon an unsheltered and stricken race, and  many of them perished.    Then the Great Spirit, who had almost removed his face from the sight  of men, had pity and told them he would come back. Day after day the  few that remained alive watched with joy the return of the sun. They  sang in praise of the approaching summer and once more hailed with  thankfulness the first blades of growing corn as it burst from the  ground. The Great Spirit told his children that every year, as a  punishment for the insults they had given their Father, they should  feel for a season the might of the power they had mocked; and they  murmured not, but bowed their heads in meekness.          SNOW SONG          Over valley, over hill,      Hark, the shepherd piping shrill,      Driving all the white flock forth,      From the far folds of the north.        Blow, wind, blow,      Weird melodies you play,      Following your flocks that go      Across the world today.        Hither, thither, up and down,      Every highway of the town,      Huddling close the white flocks all      Gather at the shepherd's call.        Blow, wind, blow,      Upon your pipes of joy,      All your sheep the flakes of snow      And you their shepherd boy.                            Frank Dempster Sherman.          THE SNOW MAIDEN    (Russian Legend)      Once upon a time there lived a peasant named Ivan and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#3)"],[1,"uttermost farthing.\" The measure ye mete \"shall  5:12    be measured to you again,\" and it will be full \"and run-          ning over.\"            Saints and sinners get their full award, but not always  5:15    in this world. The followers of Christ drank his cup.          Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim; but God          pours the riches of His love into the understanding and  5:18    affections, giving us strength according to our day. Sin-          ners flourish \"like a green bay tree;\" but, looking farther,          the Psalmist could see their end, - the destruction of sin  5:21    through suffering.                            Cancellation of human sin            Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin.          Such an error would impede true religion. Sin is forgiven  5:24    only as it is destroyed by Christ, - Truth and          Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is          cancelled, and that man is made better merely by praying,  5:27    prayer is an evil. He grows worse who continues in sin          because he fancies himself forgiven.                               Diabolism destroyed            An apostle says that the Son of God [Christ] came to  5:30    \"destroy the /works/ of the devil.\" We should          follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the de-          struction of all evil works, error and disease included.  6:1     We cannot escape the penalty due for sin. The Scrip-          tures say, that if we deny Christ, \" he also will deny us.\"                              Pardon and amendment    6:3     Divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may          pardon, but this divine Principle alone reforms the          sinner. God is not separate from the wis-  6:6     dom He bestows. The talents He gives we          must improve. Calling on Him to forgive our work          badly done or left undone, implies the vain supposition  6:9     that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and          that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.            To cause suffering as the result of sin, is the means  6:12    of destroying sin. Every supposed pleasure in sin          will furnish more than its equivalent of pain, until be-          lief in material life and sin is destroyed. To reach  6:15    heaven, the harmony of being, we must understand          the divine Principle of being.                            Mercy without partiality            \"God is Love.\" More than this we cannot ask,  6:18    higher we cannot look, farther we cannot go. To          suppose that God forgives or punishes sin          according as His mercy is sought or un-  6:21    sought, is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer          the safety-valve for wrong-doing.                                 Divine severity            Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it  6:24    out. Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound          her, and to Peter he said, \"Thou art an of-          fence unto me.\" He came teaching and  6:27    showing men how to destroy sin, sickness, and death.          He said of the fruitless tree, \"[It] is hewn down.\"            It is believed by many that a certain magistrate,  6:30    who lived in the time of Jesus, left this record: \"His          rebuke is fearful.\" The strong language of our Mas-          ter confirms this description.    7:1     The only civil sentence which he had for error was,          \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" Still stronger evidence  7:3     that Jesus' reproof was pointed and pungent is found          in his own words,- showing the necessity for such          forcible utterance, when he cast out devils and healed  7:6     the sick and sinning. The relinquishment of error de-          prives material sense of its false claims.                                 Audible praying            Audible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary  7:9     solemnity and elevation to thought. But does it pro-          duce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply          into these things, we find that \"a zeal . . .  7:12    not according to knowledge\" gives occasion for reac-          tion unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve, and          wholesome perception of God's requirements. The mo-  7:15    tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of          applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment.                              Emotional utterances            Physical sensation, not Soul, produces material ec-  7:18    stasy and emotion. If spiritual sense always guided          men, there would grow out of ecstatic mo-          ments a higher experience and a better life  7:21    with more devout self-abnegation and purity. A self-          satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes          a Christian. God is not influenced by man. The \"di-  7:24    vine ear\" is not an auditory nerve. It is the all-hearing          and all-knowing Mind, to whom each need of man is          always known and by whom it will be supplied.                           Danger from audible prayer    7:27    The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp-          tation. By it we may become involuntary hypocrites, ut-          tering desires which are not real and consoling  7:30    ourselves in the midst of sin with the recollection          that we have prayed over it or mean to ask for-          giveness at some later day. Hypocrisy is fatal to religion.    8:1     A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-          justification, though it makes the sinner a hypocrite.  8:3     We never need to despair of an honest heart; but          there is little hope for those who come only spasmodi-          cally face to face with their wickedness and then seek to  8:6     hide it. Their prayers are indexes which do not correspond          with their character. They hold secret fellowship with          sin, and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as \"like  8:9     unto whited sepulchres . . . full . . . of all uncleanness.\"                               Aspiration and love            If a man, though apparently fervent and prayerful,          is impure and therefore insincere, what must be the  8:12    comment upon him? If he reached the          loftiness of his prayer, there would be no          occasion for comment. If we feel the aspiration, hu-  8:15    mility, gratitude, and love which our words express,-          this God accepts; and it is wise not to try to deceive          ourselves or others, for \"there is nothing covered that  8:18    shall not be revealed.\" Professions and audible pray-          ers are like charity in one respect,- they \"cover the          multitude of sins.\" Praying for humility with what-  8:21    ever fervency of expression does not always mean a          desire for it. If we turn away from the poor, we are          not ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses  8:24    the poor. We confess to having a very wicked heart          and ask that it may be laid bare before us, but do          we not already know more of this heart than we are  8:27    willing to have our neighbor see?                               Searching the heart            We should examine ourselves and learn what is the          affection and purpose of the heart, for in this way  8:30    only can we learn what we honestly are. If a          friend informs us of a fault, do we listen pa-          tiently to the rebuke and credit what is said? Do we not  9:1     rather give thanks that we are \"not as other men\"?          During many years the author has been most grateful  9:3     for merited rebuke. The wrong lies in unmerited cen-          sure,- in the falsehood which does no one any good.                              Summit of aspiration            The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these  9:6     questions: Do we love our neighbor better because of          this asking? Do we pursue the old selfish-          ness, satisfied with having prayed for some-  9:9     thing better, though we give no evidence of the sin-          cerity of our requests by living consistently with our          prayer? If selfishness has given place to kindness,  9:12    we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly, and bless          them that curse us; but we shall never meet this great          duty simply by asking that it may be done. There is  9:15    a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition          of our hope and faith.                               Practical religion            Dost thou \"love the Lord thy God with all thy  9:18    heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\"?          This command includes much, even the sur-          render of all merely material sensation, affec-  9:21    tion, and worship. This is the El Dorado of Christianity.          It involves the Science of Life, and recognizes only the          divine control of Spirit, in which Soul is our master,  9:24    and material sense and human will have no place.                             The chalice sacrificial            Are you willing to leave all for Christ, for Truth, and          so be counted among sinners? No! Do you really desire  9:27    to attain this point? No! Then why make long          prayers about it and ask to be Christians,          since you do not care to tread in the footsteps of our  9:30    dear Master? If unwilling to follow his example, why          pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his          nature? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right.  10:1    Prayer means that we desire to walk and will walk in          the light so far as we receive it, even though with bleed-  10:3    ing footsteps, and that waiting patiently on the Lord,          we will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him.            The world must grow to the spiritual understanding  10:6    of prayer. If good enough to profit by Jesus' cup of          earthly sorrows, God will"]]]
