The following receipts are not a mere marrowless collection of shreds  and patches, and cuttings and pastings, but a bona fide register of  practical facts,--accumulated by a perseverance not to be subdued or  evaporated by the igniferous terrors of a roasting fire in the  dog-days,--in defiance of the odoriferous and calefacient repellents of  roasting, boiling, frying, and broiling;--moreover, the author has  submitted to a labour no preceding cookery-book-maker, perhaps, ever  attempted to encounter,--having _eaten_ each receipt before he set it  down in his book.    They have all been heartily welcomed by a sufficiently well-educated  palate, and a rather fastidious stomach:--perhaps this certificate of  the reception of the respective preparations, will partly apologize for  the book containing a smaller number of them than preceding writers on  this gratifying subject have transcribed--for the amusement of \"every  man's master,\" the STOMACH.[15-*]    Numerous as are the receipts in former books, they vary little from each  other, except in the name given to them; the processes of cookery are  very few: I have endeavoured to describe each, in so plain and  circumstantial a manner, as I hope will be easily understood, even by  the amateur, who is unacquainted with the practical part of culinary  concerns.    OLD HOUSEKEEPERS may think I have been tediously minute on many points  which may appear trifling: my predecessors seem to have considered the  RUDIMENTS of COOKERY quite unworthy of attention. These little delicate  distinctions constitute all the difference between a common and an  elegant table, and are not trifles to the YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS who must  learn them either from the communication of others or blunder on till  their own slowly accumulating and dear-bought experience teaches them.    A wish to save time, trouble and money to inexperienced housekeepers and  cooks, and to bring the enjoyments and indulgences of the opulent within  reach of the middle ranks of society, were my motives for publishing  this book. I could accomplish it only by supposing the reader (when he  first opens it) to be as ignorant of cookery as I was, when I first  thought of writing on the subject.    I have done my best to contribute to the comfort of my fellow-creatures:  by a careful attention to the directions herein given, the most ignorant  may easily learn to prepare food, not only in an agreeable and  wholesome, but in an elegant and economical manner.    This task seems to have been left for me; and I have endeavoured to  collect and communicate, in the clearest and most intelligible manner,  the whole of the heretofore abstruse mysteries of the culinary art,  which are herein, I hope, so plainly developed, that the most  inexperienced student in the occult art of cookery, may work from my  receipts with the utmost facility.    I was perfectly aware of the extreme difficulty of teaching those who  are entirely unacquainted with the subject, and of explaining my ideas  effectually, by mere receipts, to those who never shook hands with a  stewpan.    In my anxiety to be readily understood, I have been under the necessity  of occasionally repeating the same directions in different parts of the  book; but I would rather be censured for repetition than for obscurity,  and hope not to be accused of affectation, while my intention is  perspicuity.    Our neighbours of France are so justly famous for their skill in the  affairs of the kitchen, that the adage says, \"As many Frenchmen as many  cooks:\" surrounded as they are by a profusion of the most delicious  wines, and seducing _liqueurs_ offering every temptation to render  drunkenness delightful, yet a tippling Frenchman is a \"_rara avis_.\"    They know how so easily to keep life in sufficient repair by good  eating, that they require little or no screwing up with liquid stimuli.  This accounts for that \"_toujours gai_,\" and happy equilibrium of the  animal spirits which they enjoy with more regularity than any people:  their elastic stomachs, unimpaired by spirituous liquors, digest  vigorously the food they sagaciously prepare and render easily  assimilable, by cooking it sufficiently,--wisely contriving to get half  the work of the stomach done by fire and water, till        \"The tender morsels on the palate melt,      And all the force of cookery is felt.\"    See Nos. 5 and 238, &c.    The cardinal virtues of cookery, \"CLEANLINESS, FRUGALITY, NOURISHMENT,  AND PALATABLENESS,\" preside over each preparation; for I have not  presumed to insert a single composition, without previously obtaining  the \"_imprimatur_\" of an enlightened and indefatigable \"COMMITTEE OF  TASTE,\" (composed of thorough-bred GRANDS GOURMANDS of the first  magnitude,) whose cordial co-operation I cannot too highly praise; and  here do I most gratefully record the unremitting zeal they manifested  during their arduous progress of proving the respective recipes: they  were so truly philosophically and disinterestedly regardless of the wear  and tear of teeth and stomach, that their labour appeared a pleasure to  them. Their laudable perseverance has enabled me to give the  inexperienced amateur an unerring guide how to excite as much pleasure  as possible on the palate, and occasion as little trouble as possible to  the principal viscera, and has hardly been exceeded by those determined  spirits who lately in the Polar expedition braved the other extreme of  temperature, &c. in spite of whales, bears, icebergs, and starvation.    Every attention has been paid in directing the proportions of the  following compositions; not merely to make them inviting to the  appetite, but agreeable and useful to the stomach--nourishing without  being inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting.    I have written for those who make nourishment the chief end of  eating,[17-*] and do not desire to provoke appetite beyond the powers  and necessities of nature; proceeding, however, on the purest epicurean  principles of indulging the palate as far as it can be done without  injury or offence to the stomach, and forbidding[18-*] nothing but what  is absolutely unfriendly to health.        ----\"That which is not good, is not delicious      To a well-govern'd and wise appetite.\"--MILTON.    This is by no means so difficult a task as some gloomy philosophers  (uninitiated in culinary science) have tried to make the world believe;  who seem to have delighted in persuading you, that every thing that is  nice must be noxious, and that every thing that is nasty is wholesome.        \"How charming is divine philosophy?      Not harsh, and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,      But musical as is Apollo's lute,      And a perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets,      Where no crude surfeit reigns.\"--MILTON.    Worthy William Shakspeare declared he never found a philosopher who  could endure the toothache patiently:--the Editor protests that he has  not yet overtaken one who did not love a feast.    Those _cynical_ slaves who are so silly as to suppose it unbecoming a  wise man to indulge in the common comforts of life, should be answered  in the words of the French philosopher. \"Hey--what, do you philosophers  eat dainties?\" said a gay Marquess. \"Do you think,\" replied DESCARTES,  \"that God made good things only for fools?\"    Every individual, who is not perfectly imbecile and void of  understanding, is an _epicure_ in his own way. The epicures in boiling  of potatoes are innumerable. The perfection of all enjoyment depends on  the perfection of the faculties of the mind and body; therefore, the  temperate man is the greatest epicure, and the only true voluptuary.    THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE have been highly appreciated and carefully  cultivated in all countries and in all ages;[19-*] and in spite of all  the stoics, every one will allow they are the first and the last we  enjoy, and those we taste the oftenest,--above a thousand times in a  year, every year of our lives!    THE STOMACH is the mainspring of our system. If it be not sufficiently  wound up to warm the heart and support the circulation, the whole  business of life will, in proportion, be ineffectively performed: we can  neither _think_ with precision, _walk_ with vigour, _sit down_ with  comfort, nor _sleep_ with tranquillity.    There would be no difficulty in proving that it influences (much more  than people in general imagine) all our actions: the destiny of nations  has often depended upon the more or less laborious digestion of a prime  minister.[19-+] See a very curious anecdote in the memoirs of COUNT  ZINZENDORFF in Dodsley's Annual Register for 1762. 3d edition, p. 32.    The philosopher Pythagoras seems to have been extremely nice in eating;  among his absolute injunctions to his disciples, he commands them to  \"abstain from beans.\"    This ancient sage has been imitated by the learned who have discoursed  on this subject since, who are liberal of their negative, and niggardly  of their positive precepts--in the ratio, that it is easier to tell you  not to do this, than to teach you how to do that.    Our great English moralist Dr. S. JOHNSON, his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#3)"],[1,"never do.    I threw my hand up and my head down. The first act elevated the muzzle,  and the second removed my head from the path of the bullet which went  whistling past. One hand closed on George's wrist, the other on the  revolver. Yellow Handkerchief and his gang sprang toward me. It was now  or never. Putting all my strength into a sudden effort, I swung  George's body forward to meet them. Then I pulled back with equal  suddenness, ripping the revolver out of his fingers and jerking him off  his feet. He fell against Yellow Handkerchief's knees, who stumbled over  him, and the pair wallowed in the bailing hole where the cockpit floor  was torn open. The next instant I was covering them with my revolver,  and the wild shrimp-catchers were cowering and cringing away.    But I swiftly discovered that there was all the difference in the world  between shooting men who are attacking and men who are doing nothing  more than simply refusing to obey. For obey they would not when I  ordered them into the bailing hole. I threatened them with the revolver,  but they sat stolidly in the flooded cabin and on the roof and would  not move.    Fifteen minutes passed, the _Reindeer_ sinking deeper and deeper, her  mainsail flapping in the calm. But from off the Point Pedro shore I saw  a dark line form on the water and travel toward us. It was the steady  breeze I had been expecting so long. I called to the Chinese and  pointed it out. They hailed it with exclamations. Then I pointed to the  sail and to the water in the _Reindeer_, and indicated by signs that  when the wind reached the sail, what of the water aboard we would  capsize. But they jeered defiantly, for they knew it was in my power to  luff the helm and let go the main-sheet, so as to spill the wind and  escape damage.    But my mind was made up. I hauled in the main-sheet a foot or two, took  a turn with it, and bracing my feet, put my back against the tiller.  This left me one hand for the sheet and one for the revolver. The dark  line drew nearer, and I could see them looking from me to it and back  again with an apprehension they could not successfully conceal. My  brain and will and endurance were pitted against theirs, and the  problem was which could stand the strain of imminent death the longer  and not give in.    Then the wind struck us. The mainsheet tautened with a brisk rattling  of the blocks, the boom uplifted, the sail bellied out, and the  _Reindeer_ heeled over--over, and over, till the lee-rail went under,  the deck went under, the cabin windows went under, and the bay began to  pour in over the cockpit rail. So violently had she heeled over, that  the men in the cabin had been thrown on top of one another into the lee  bunk, where they squirmed and twisted and were washed about, those  underneath being perilously near to drowning.    The wind freshened a bit, and the _Reindeer_ went over farther than  ever. For the moment I thought she was gone, and I knew that another  puff like that and she surely would go. While I pressed her under and  debated whether I should give up or not, the Chinese cried for mercy. I  think it was the sweetest sound I have ever heard. And then, and not  until then, did I luff up and ease out the main-sheet. The _Reindeer_  righted very slowly, and when she was on an even keel was so much awash  that I doubted if she could be saved.    But the Chinese scrambled madly into the cockpit and fell to bailing  with buckets, pots, pans, and everything they could lay hands on. It  was a beautiful sight to see that water flying over the side! And when  the _Reindeer_ was high and proud on the water once more, we dashed  away with the breeze on our quarter, and at the last possible moment  crossed the mud flats and entered the slough.    The spirit of the Chinese was broken, and so docile did they become  that ere we made San Rafael they were out with the tow-rope, Yellow  Handkerchief at the head of the line. As for George, it was his last  trip with the fish patrol. He did not care for that sort of thing, he  explained, and he thought a clerkship ashore was good enough for him.  And we thought so, too.          II    THE KING OF THE GREEKS      Big Alec had never been captured by the fish patrol. It was his boast  that no man could take him alive, and it was his history that of the  many men who had tried to take him dead none had succeeded. It was also  history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to take him dead had  died themselves. Further, no man violated the fish laws more  systematically and deliberately than Big Alec.    He was called \"Big Alec\" because of his gigantic stature. His height  was six feet three inches, and he was correspondingly broad-shouldered  and deep-chested. He was splendidly muscled and hard as steel, and  there were innumerable stories in circulation among the fisher-folk  concerning his prodigious strength. He was as bold and dominant of  spirit as he was strong of body, and because of this he was widely  known by another name, that of \"The King of the Greeks.\" The fishing  population was largely composed of Greeks, and they looked up to him  and obeyed him as their chief. And as their chief, he fought their  fights for them, saw that they were protected, saved them from the law  when they fell into its clutches, and made them stand by one another  and himself in time of trouble.    In the old days, the fish patrol had attempted his capture many  disastrous times and had finally given it over, so that when the word  was out that he was coming to Benicia, I was most anxious to see him.    But I did not have to hunt him up. In his usual bold way, the first  thing he did on arriving was to hunt us up. Charley Le Grant and I at  the time were under a patrolman named Carmintel, and the three of us  were on the _Reindeer_, preparing for a trip, when Big Alec stepped  aboard. Carmintel evidently knew him, for they shook hands in  recognition. Big Alec took no notice of Charley or me.    \"I've come down to fish sturgeon a couple of months,\" he said to  Carmintel.    His eyes flashed with challenge as he spoke, and we noticed the  patrolman's eyes drop before him.    \"That's all right, Alec,\" Carmintel said in a low voice. \"I'll not  bother you. Come on into the cabin, and we'll talk things over,\" he  added.    When they had gone inside and shut the doors after them, Charley winked  with slow deliberation at me. But I was only a youngster, and new to  men and the ways of some men, so I did not understand. Nor did Charley  explain, though I felt there was something wrong about the business.    Leaving them to their conference, at Charley's suggestion we boarded  our skiff and pulled over to the Old Steamboat Wharf, where Big Alec's  ark was lying. An ark is a house-boat of small though comfortable  dimensions, and is as necessary to the Upper Bay fisherman as are nets  and boats. We were both curious to see Big Alec's ark, for history said  that it had been the scene of more than one pitched battle, and that it  was riddled with bullet-holes.    We found the holes (stopped with wooden plugs and painted over), but  there were not so many as I had expected. Charley noted my look of  disappointment, and laughed; and then to comfort me he gave an  authentic account of one expedition which had descended upon Big Alec's  floating home to capture him, alive preferably, dead if necessary. At  the end of half a day's fighting, the patrolmen had drawn off in  wrecked boats, with one of their number killed and three wounded. And  when they returned next morning with reenforcements they found only the  mooring-stakes of Big Alec's ark; the ark itself remained hidden for  months in the fastnesses of the Suisun tules.    \"But why was he not hanged for murder?\" I demanded. \"Surely the United  States is powerful enough to bring such a man to justice.\"    \"He gave himself up and stood trial,\" Charley answered. \"It cost him  fifty thousand dollars to win the case, which he did on technicalities  and with the aid of the best lawyers in the state. Every Greek  fisherman on the river contributed to the sum. Big Alec levied and  collected the tax, for all the world like a king. The United States may  be all-powerful, my lad, but the fact remains that Big Alec is a king  inside the United States, with a country and subjects all his own.\"    \"But what are you going to do about his fishing for sturgeon? He's  bound to fish with a 'Chinese line.'\"    Charley shrugged his shoulders. \"We'll see what we will see,\" he said  enigmatically.    Now a \"Chinese line\" is a cunning device invented by the people whose  name it bears. By a simple system of floats, weights, and anchors,  thousands of hooks, each on a separate leader, are suspended at a  distance of from six inches to a foot above the bottom. The remarkable  thing about such a line is the hook. It is barbless, and in place of  the barb, the hook is filed long and tapering to a point as sharp as  that of a needle. These hooks are only a few inches apart, and when  several thousand of them are suspended just above the bottom, like a  fringe, for a couple of hundred fathoms, they present a formidable  obstacle to the fish that travel along the bottom.    Such a fish is the sturgeon, which goes rooting along like a pig, and  indeed is often called \"pig-fish.\" Pricked by the first hook it touches,  the sturgeon gives a startled leap and comes into contact with half a  dozen more hooks. Then it threshes about wildly, until it receives hook  after hook in its soft flesh; and the hooks, straining from many  different angles, hold the luckless fish fast until it is drowned.  Because no sturgeon can pass through a Chinese line, the device is  called a trap in the fish laws; and because it bids fair to exterminate  the sturgeon, it is branded by the fish laws as illegal. And such a  line, we were confident, Big Alec intended setting, in open and flagrant  violation of the"]]]
