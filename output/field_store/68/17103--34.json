(Smithsonian photo 49373.)]    About the same time, Josef Madersperger, a tailor in Vienna, Austria,  invented a sewing machine, which was illustrated (fig. 7) and described  in a 15-page pamphlet published about 1816.[11] On May 12, 1817, a  Vienna newspaper wrote of the Madersperger machine: \"The approbation  which his machine received everywhere has induced his Royal Imperial  Majesty, in the year 1814, to give to the inventor an exclusive  privilege [patent] which has already been mentioned before in these  papers.\"[12] Madersperger's 1814 machine stitched straight or curving  lines. His second machine stitched small semicircles, as shown in the  illustration, and also small circles, egg-shaped figures, and angles of  various degrees. The machine, acclaimed by the art experts, must  therefore have been intended for embroidery stitching. From the  contemporary descriptions and the illustration, the machine is judged to  have made a couched stitch--one thread was laid on the surface of the  fabric and stitched in place with a short thread carried by a  two-pointed needle of the type invented by Weisenthal. Two fabrics could  have been stitched together, but not in the manner required for  tailoring. The machine must have had many deficiencies in the tension  adjustment, feed, and related mechanical operations, for despite the  published wishes for success the inventor did not put the machine into  practical operation.[13] Years later Madersperger again attempted to  invent a sewing machine using a different stitch (see p. 13).    [Illustration: Figure 8.--AN ENGRAVING OF THIMONNIER and his sewing  machine of 1830, from _Sewing Machine News_, 1880. (Smithsonian photo  10569-C.)]    A story persists that about 1818-1819 a machine that formed a  backstitch, identical to the one used in hand sewing, was invented in  Monkton, Vermont. The earliest record of this machine that this author  has found was in the second or 1867 edition of _Eighty Years of Progress  of the United States_; the machine is not mentioned in the earlier  edition. The writer of the article on sewing machines states that John  Knowles invented and constructed a sewing machine, which used a single  thread and a two-pointed needle with the eye in the middle to form the  backstitch. This information must have come to light after the first  edition was published, but from where and by whom is not known. Other  sources state that two men, Adams and Dodge, produced this machine in  Monkton.[14] While still others credit the Reverend John Adam Dodge,  assisted by a mechanic by the name of John Knowles, with the same  invention in the same location.[15] Vermont historical societies have  been unable to identify the men named or to verify the story of the  invention.[16] The importance of the credibility of this story, if  proved, rests in the fact that it represents the first effort in the  United States to produce a mechanical stitching device.      1820-1845    American records of this period are incomplete as a result of the Patent  Office fire of 1836, in which most of the specific descriptions of  patents issued to that date were destroyed. Patentees were asked to  provide another description of their patents so that these might be  copied, but comparatively few responded and only a small percentage was  restored. Thus, although the printed index of patents[17] lists Henry  Lye as patenting a machine for \"sewing leather, and so forth\" on March  10, 1826, no description of the machine has ever been located. Many  patents whose original claim was for only a mechanical awl to pierce  holes in leather or a clamp to hold leather for hand stitching were  claimed as sewing devices once a practical machine had evolved. But no  evidence has ever been found that any of these machines performed the  actual stitching operation.    [Illustration: Figure 9.--AN ADAPTED DRAWING of Hunt's sewing machine  published by the _Sewing Machine News_, vol. 2, no. 8, 1881, to give  some idea of its construction and operation. \"The frame of the machine  (A) rested on a base (B) that was supported by a table.

After several years of fruitless effort he invented a machine for which  he received a French patent in 1830.[19] The machine (fig. 8) made a  chainstitch by means of a barbed or hooked needle. The vertically held  needle worked from an overhanging arm. The needle thrust through the  fabric laid on the horizontal table, caught a thread from the thread  carrier and looper beneath the table, and brought a loop to the surface  of the fabric. When the process was repeated the second loop became  enchained in the first. The needle was moved downward by the depression  of a cord-connected foot treadle and was raised by the action of a  spring. The fabric was fed through the stitching mechanism manually, and  a regular rate of speed had to be maintained by the operator in order to  produce stitches of equal length. A type of retractable thimble or  presser foot was used to hold the fabric down as required.    The needle, and the entire machine, was basically an attempt to  mechanize tambour embroidery, with which the inventor was quite  familiar. Although this work, which served as the machine's inspiration,  was always used for decorative embroidery, Thimonnier saw the  possibilities of using the stitch for utilitarian purposes. By 1841 he  had 80 machines stitching army clothing in a Paris shop. But a mob of  tailors, fearing that the invention would rob them of a livelihood,  broke into the shop and destroyed the machines. Thimonnier fled Paris,  penniless. Four years later he had obtained new financial help, improved  his machine to produce 200 stitches a minute, and organized the first  French sewing-machine company.[20] The Revolution of 1848, however,  brought this enterprise to an early end. Before new support could be  found other inventors had appeared with better machines, and  Thimonnier's was passed by. In addition to the two French patents  Thimonnier also received a British patent with his associate Jean Marie  Magnin in 1848 and one in the United States in 1850. He achieved no  financial gain from either of these and died a poor man.    While Thimonnier was developing his chainstitch machine in France,  Walter Hunt,[21] perhaps best described as a Yankee mechanical genius,  was working on a different kind of sewing machine in the United States.  Sometime between 1832 and 1834 he produced at his shop in New York a  machine that made a lockstitch.[22] This stitch was the direct result of  the mechanical method devised to produce the stitching and represented  the first occasion an inventor had not attempted to reproduce a hand  stitch. The lockstitch required two threads, one passing through a loop  in the other and both interlocking in the heart of the seam. At the time  Hunt did not consider the sewing machine any more promising than several  other inventions that he had in mind, and, after demonstrating that the  machine would sew, he sold his interest in it for a small sum and did  not bother to patent it.    A description--one of few ever published--and sketch of a rebuilt Hunt  machine (fig. 9) appeared in an article in the _Sewing Machine News_ in  1881.[23] The important element in the Hunt invention was an eye-pointed  needle working in combination with a shuttle carrying a second thread.  Future inventors were thus no longer hampered by the erroneous idea that  the sewing machine must imitate the human hands and fingers. Though  Hunt's machine stitched short, straight seams with speed and accuracy,  it could not sew curved or angular work. Its stitching was not  continuous, but had to be reset at the end of a short run. The validity  of Hunt's claim as the inventor of the lockstitch and the prescribed  method of making it was argued many times, especially during the Elias  Howe patent suits of the 1850s. The decision against Hunt was not a  question of invention,[24] but one of right to ownership or control.  Hunt did little to promote his sewing machine and sold it together with  the right to patent to George A. Arrowsmith.    [Illustration: Figure 10.--MADERSPERGER'S 1839 sewing machine.  Madersperger's machine consisted of two major parts: the frame, which  held the material, and the stitching mechanism, called the hand. The  hand shown here is an original model.

When the sewing-machine litigation  developed in the 1850s, the I. M. Singer company searched out the Hunt  machine, had the inventor rebuild one,[25] and attempted to use this to  break the Howe patent.

St. Aubert observed this more than once, and gently  reproved her for the emotion; but she could only smile, clasp his hand,  and that of Emily, and weep the more. He felt the tender enthusiasm  stealing upon himself in a degree that became almost painful; his  features assumed a serious air, and he could not forbear secretly  sighing--'Perhaps I shall some time look back to these moments, as to  the summit of my happiness, with hopeless regret. But let me not misuse  them by useless anticipation; let me hope I shall not live to mourn the  loss of those who are dearer to me than life.'    To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the pensive temper of his mind, he  bade Emily fetch the lute she knew how to touch with such sweet pathos.  As she drew near the fishing-house, she was surprised to hear the tones  of the instrument, which were awakened by the hand of taste, and uttered  a plaintive air, whose exquisite melody engaged all her attention. She  listened in profound silence, afraid to move from the spot, lest the  sound of her steps should occasion her to lose a note of the music, or  should disturb the musician. Every thing without the building was still,  and no person appeared. She continued to listen, till timidity succeeded  to surprise and delight; a timidity, increased by a remembrance of the  pencilled lines she had formerly seen, and she hesitated whether to  proceed, or to return.    While she paused, the music ceased; and, after a momentary hesitation,  she re-collected courage to advance to the fishing-house, which she  entered with faltering steps, and found unoccupied! Her lute lay on the  table; every thing seemed undisturbed, and she began to believe it was  another instrument she had heard, till she remembered, that, when she  followed M. and Madame St. Aubert from this spot, her lute was left on  a window seat. She felt alarmed, yet knew not wherefore; the melancholy  gloom of evening, and the profound stillness of the place, interrupted  only by the light trembling of leaves, heightened her fanciful  apprehensions, and she was desirous of quitting the building, but  perceived herself grow faint, and sat down. As she tried to recover  herself, the pencilled lines on the wainscot met her eye; she started,  as if she had seen a stranger; but, endeavouring to conquer the tremor  of her spirits, rose, and went to the window. To the lines before  noticed she now perceived that others were added, in which her name  appeared.    Though no longer suffered to doubt that they were addressed to herself,  she was as ignorant, as before, by whom they could be written. While she  mused, she thought she heard the sound of a step without the building,  and again alarmed, she caught up her lute, and hurried away. Monsieur  and Madame St. Aubert she found in a little path that wound along the  sides of the glen.    Having reached a green summit, shadowed by palm-trees, and overlooking  the vallies and plains of Gascony, they seated themselves on the turf;  and while their eyes wandered over the glorious scene, and they inhaled  the sweet breath of flowers and herbs that enriched the grass, Emily  played and sung several of their favourite airs, with the delicacy of  expression in which she so much excelled.    Music and conversation detained them in this enchanting spot, till the  sun's last light slept upon the plains; till the white sails that glided  beneath the mountains, where the Garonne wandered, became dim, and the  gloom of evening stole over the landscape. It was a melancholy but not  unpleasing gloom. St. Aubert and his family rose, and left the place  with regret; alas! Madame St. Aubert knew not that she left it for ever.    When they reached the fishing-house she missed her bracelet, and  recollected that she had taken it from her arm after dinner, and had  left it on the table when she went to walk. After a long search, in  which Emily was very active, she was compelled to resign herself to the  loss of it. What made this bracelet valuable to her was a miniature of  her daughter to which it was attached, esteemed a striking resemblance,  and which had been painted only a few months before. When Emily was  convinced that the bracelet was really gone, she blushed, and became  thoughtful. That some stranger had been in the fishing-house, during  her absence, her lute, and the additional lines of a pencil, had already  informed her: from the purport of these lines it was not unreasonable  to believe, that the poet, the musician, and the thief were the same  person. But though the music she had heard, the written lines she had  seen, and the disappearance of the picture, formed a combination of  circumstances very remarkable, she was irresistibly restrained from  mentioning them; secretly determining, however, never again to visit the  fishing-house without Monsieur or Madame St. Aubert.    They returned pensively to the chateau, Emily musing on the incident  which had just occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with placid gratitude,  on the blessings he possessed; and Madame St. Aubert somewhat disturbed,  and perplexed, by the loss of her daughter's picture. As they drew near  the house, they observed an unusual bustle about it; the sound of voices  was distinctly heard, servants and horses were seen passing between the  trees, and, at length, the wheels of a carriage rolled along. Having  come within view of the front of the chateau, a landau, with smoking  horses, appeared on the little lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the  liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the parlour he found Monsieur and  Madame Quesnel already entered. They had left Paris some days before,  and were on the way to their estate, only ten leagues distant from La  Vallee, and which Monsieur Quesnel had purchased several years before  of St. Aubert. This gentleman was the only brother of Madame St.  Aubert; but the ties of relationship having never been strengthened by  congeniality of character, the intercourse between them had not been  frequent. M. Quesnel had lived altogether in the world; his aim had been  consequence; splendour was the object of his taste; and his address  and knowledge of character had carried him forward to the attainment of  almost all that he had courted. By a man of such a disposition, it is  not surprising that the virtues of St. Aubert should be overlooked; or  that his pure taste, simplicity, and moderated wishes, were considered  as marks of a weak intellect, and of confined views. The marriage of his  sister with St. Aubert had been mortifying to his ambition, for he had  designed that the matrimonial connection she formed should assist him  to attain the consequence which he so much desired; and some offers were  made her by persons whose rank and fortune flattered his warmest hope.  But his sister, who was then addressed also by St. Aubert, perceived, or  thought she perceived, that happiness and splendour were not the same,  and she did not hesitate to forego the last for the attainment of the  former. Whether Monsieur Quesnel thought them the same, or not, he would  readily have sacrificed his sister's peace to the gratification of his  own ambition; and, on her marriage with St. Aubert, expressed in private  his contempt of her spiritless conduct, and of the connection which it  permitted. Madame St. Aubert, though she concealed this insult from her  husband, felt, perhaps, for the first time, resentment lighted in  her heart; and, though a regard for her own dignity, united with  considerations of prudence, restrained her expression of this  resentment, there was ever after a mild reserve in her manner towards M.  Quesnel, which he both understood and felt.    In his own marriage he did not follow his sister's example. His lady was  an Italian, and an heiress by birth; and, by nature and education, was a  vain and frivolous woman.    They now determined to pass the night with St. Aubert; and as the  chateau was not large enough to accommodate their servants, the latter  were dismissed to the neighbouring village. When the first compliments  were over, and the arrangements for the night made M. Quesnel began the  display of his intelligence and his connections; while St. Aubert, who  had been long enough in retirement to find these topics recommended by  their novelty, listened, with a degree of patience and attention,  which his guest mistook for the humility of wonder. The latter, indeed,  described the few festivities which the turbulence of that period  permitted to the court of Henry the Third, with a minuteness, that  somewhat recompensed for his ostentation; but, when he came to speak of  the character of the Duke de Joyeuse, of a secret treaty, which he knew  to be negotiating with the Porte, and of the light in which Henry of  Navarre was received, M. St. Aubert recollected enough of his former  experience to be assured, that his guest could be only of an inferior  class of politicians; and that, from the importance of the subjects  upon which he committed himself, he could not be of the rank to which he  pretended to belong. The opinions delivered by M. Quesnel, were such as  St. Aubert forebore to reply to, for he knew that his guest had neither  humanity to feel, nor discernment to perceive, what is just.    Madame Quesnel, meanwhile, was expressing to Madame St. Aubert her  astonishment, that she could bear to pass her life in this remote corner  of the world, as she called it, and describing, from a wish, probably,  of exciting envy, the splendour of the balls, banquets, and processions  which had just been given by the court, in honour of the nuptials of the  Duke de Joyeuse with Margaretta of Lorrain, the sister of the Queen. She  described with equal minuteness the magnificence she had"]]]
