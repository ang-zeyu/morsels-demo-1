The day before the letter was published Emperor Charles sent a telegram  to Emperor William, in which he said:        I accuse M. Clemenceau of piling up lies to escape the web of      lies in which he is involved, making the false assertion that I      in some manner recognized France's claim to Alsace-Lorraine as      just. I indignantly repel the assertion.    To this the German Emperor replied as follows:        Accept my heartiest thanks for the letter in which you repudiate      the assertion of the French Premier regarding your attitude      toward the French claims on Alsace-Lorraine as entirely baseless      and once again accentuate the solidarity of the interests which      exist between us and our empires. I hasten to tell you that in      my eyes there is no need whatever for such assurance on your      part, for I have not for a moment been in doubt. You have made      our cause your own; in like measure we stand for the rights of      your monarchy.        The heavy battles in these years clearly demonstrate this for      every one who will see. They have only drawn the bond closer.      Our enemies, who are unable to do anything against us in      honorable battle, do not recoil from the most sordid and lowest      means. We must put up with that, but all the more it is our duty      ruthlessly to grapple with and beat the enemy in all the war      theatres.    After the publication of the letter the Austrian Government announced  that it was \"garbled\" and intimated that portions of it were forged  before it reached Prince Sixtus. The German press accepted the letter as  genuine with caustic and hostile criticism. It was announced April 18  that the original letter of the Emperor was in the possession of Prince  Sixtus, who sent a copy of it to President Poincare.      WHEN AUSTRIA RULED PRUSSIA    Emperor Karl's effort to make a separate peace recalls the period,  beginning with the Summer of 1849, when Austria and Prussia were  literally at daggers drawn. Twenty-eight North German States had just  formed a Prussian League, under the leadership of Friedrich Wilhelm IV.  of Prussia. Austria, under the leadership of Franz Josef, organized a  counterleague of South German States, and had the support of Nicholas  I. of Russia, who had helped Austria to subdue Hungary. Schwarzenberg,  the fighting man of the Austrian Confederation, announced his policy:  \"First humiliate Prussia, then destroy her.\" The practical collision  between Prussian North Germany and Austrian South Germany came when the  Elector of Hesse quarreled with his people. The Hessians appealed to the  Council of the Prussian League, of which Hesse was a member, while the  Elector of Hesse appealed to the Emperor of Austria. Austria and Prussia  both set armies in movement, the Austrian force being mainly composed of  Bavarian troops, and a kind of half-battle was fought on the frontier of  Bavaria. But the Prussian Army was weak and inefficient, while Nicholas  I. of Russia was open in his support of Austria. Friedrich Wilhelm IV.  of Prussia met Schwarzenberg in a conference at Olmuetz on Nov. 28, 1850,  and offered Prussia's submission to Austria. Austria then restored the  old Diet and reorganized the German Confederation upon the basis of  1815, the Federal act creating this confederation having actually  antedated the battle of Waterloo by a week. In this confederation, which  was composed of sovereigns, not of peoples, (thirty-four sovereign  Princes and the four \"free cities\" of Hamburg, Bremen, Luebeck, and  Frankfort,) and which met in the Federal Diet at Frankfort, the Austrian  representatives presided, and Austria's pre-eminence lasted until the  battle of Sadowa, in 1866, when the simultaneous attacks of Prussia and  Italy brought about Austria's defeat.      A UNION OF THE JUGO-SLAVS    A public meeting held at Rome March 14, 1918, was addressed by Professor  Salvemini, a distinguished historian, who advocated the policy of  Mazzini that the Italians should ally themselves with the Balkan peoples  in order to free them from Austrian and Turkish domination. The speaker  opposed the teaching of Cesare Balbo, who advocated a free hand for  Austria in the Balkans in return for the cession of the Italian  provinces. The leading Serbians and numerous influential Jugo-Slav  exiles from Austria-Hungary have indorsed Professor Salvemini's  proposition, and a number of Italian Deputies and publicists have joined  the movement.    A conference under the auspices of the Serbian Society of Great Britain  was held in London March 13, 1918, which was attended by the Executive  Committees of the British-Italian League, the Anglo-Hellenic Society,  and the Anglo-Rumanian Society. The following resolutions were  unanimously passed:        1. This conference learns with gratification of the present      understanding between representative Italians and the      Jugo-Slavs, convinced as it is that it is in the vital interest      of both races that they should unite on the basis, as far as      practicable, of the principle of self-determination and in a      spirit of mutual toleration and friendliness as allies against      German and Austro-Magyar military domination.        2. The conference confidently hopes that such an understanding      will not weaken but strengthen the bonds of alliance which exist      between Serbia and Greece, and that it will be followed by a      similar amicable settlement of all outstanding questions between      Italy and Greece, so that the Eastern Mediterranean may present      a solid bulwark against the German Drang nach Osten.        3. The conference sends fraternal greetings to Rumania and      assures the Rumanian people that, whatever terms Rumania is      forced to accept from the enemy by the cruel exigencies of the      war, the British people will not cease to regard her as an ally      in spirit, and will not cease to strive for the attainment of      her national unity as one of the essential factors of a lasting      peace.    A convention of Bohemians, Slavs, Jugo-Slavs, Rumanians, Serbians,  Italians, and Poles met at Rome on April 10 under the Presidency of  former Senator Ruffini, with prominent Italians and Frenchmen present,  among them former Ministers Martini, Barzilai, Franklin, Bouillon, and  Albert Thomas. Dr. Trumbitch, President of the Jugo-Slav Committee in  Great Britain, also attended. It was the first assemblage of  representatives of the nationalities that are opposed to Austrian  dominion. The Mayor of Rome was a participant. The Italian and Polish  representatives for the first time gave their adhesion to the Jugo-Slav  aspiration. The following declaration was adopted:        1. Every people proclaims it to be its right to determine its      own nationality and national unity and complete independence.        2. Every people knows that the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy is an      instrument of German domination and a fundamental obstacle to      the realization of its rights to free development and      self-government.        3. The Congress recognizes the necessity of fighting against the      common oppressors.        The representatives of the Jugo-Slavs agree:        That the unity and independence of the Jugo-Slav Nation is      considered of vital importance by Italy.        That the deliverance of the Adriatic Sea and its defense from      any enemy is of capital interest to the two peoples.        That territorial controversies will be amicably settled on the      principle of nationality and in such a manner as not to injure      the vital interests of the two nations; interests which will be      taken into account at the peace conferences.    The Polish delegates added their declaration that they consider Germany  as the principal enemy of Poland, and that they believe that the  disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is the only way through  which they can obtain their independence from Germany.      CAN A NATION BE WIPED OUT?    If we pass by the ancient epoch when it was the custom of the conqueror  to \"take the city, and slay the people therein, and beat down the city,  and sow it with salt,\" and come to more modern times, we shall find  cause to question whether any people has been actually exterminated by  war.    Probably the worst devastation in modern Europe was that caused by the  Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) when the Germans were fighting among  themselves. Season by season, says the historian, armies of ruthless  freebooters harried the land with fire and sword. The peasant, who found  that he toiled only to feed robbers and to draw them to outrage and  torture his family, ceased to labor and became himself robber and camp  follower. Half the population and two-thirds of the movable property of  Germany were swept away. In many large districts the facts were worse  than this average. The Duchy of Wuerttemberg had 50,000 people left out  of 500,000. Populous cities had become hamlets; and for miles upon  miles, former hamlets were the lairs of wolf packs. Not until 1850 did  some sections of Germany again contain as many homesteads and cattle as  in 1618. So there is justification for the belief that Montenegro,  Serbia, and Armenia will come back again to health and strength.           *       *       *       *       *    On March 21 an order was issued, applying to all of Great Britain,  requiring all entertainments, including theatres, to close at 10:30 P.  M., and forbidding any shop window lighting. No public meals were  allowed after 9:30 P. M. at hotels, restaurants, clubs, and boarding  houses, and the tube and train services were reduced; also, by  one-sixth, the amount of gas or electricity allowance.      BRITISH MAN-POWER BILL.    The British Man-Power bill, which provides "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38767"],[0,"Spanish Highways and Byways (#3)"],[1,"we found Don Angel at the station,  muffled in the inevitable Spanish _capa_, to say good-by once more and  assure us that, come what might, we had always \"a house and a friend  in Spain.\" We laid down the local journal, hard reading that it was  with its denunciations of \"the inhuman barbarities of the North  Americans toward the Filipinos,\" and ventured to ask for his own view  of the matter.    \"The United States,\" he answered, speaking modestly and very gently,  \"means well and has, in the main, done well. When I say this in the  Casino, men get angry and call me a Yankee filibuster. But in truth  the Philippines are very dear to me and I carry a sad heart. It was  the protocol that did the mischief. It is not easy for simple  islanders to understand that words may say one thing and mean another.  Philippine faith in American promises is broken. And red is a hard  color to wash out. Yet I still hope that, when the days of slaughter  are over, peace and life may finally come to my unhappy birthplace  from your great nation. The Tagalos are not so worthless as Americans  seem to think, though the climate of the Philippines, like that of  Andalusia, tempts to indolence. But strong motives make good workers  everywhere.\"          II    A CONTINUOUS CARNIVAL         \"This periodical explosion of freedom and folly.\"--BECQUER: _El       Carnaval_.      Having re-formed our concept of a Spaniard to admit the elements of  natural vigor and determined diligence, we were surprised again to  find this tragic nation, whose fresh grief and shame had almost  deterred us from the indelicacy of intrusion, entering with eager zest  into the wild fun of Carnival. Sorrow was still fresh for the eighty  thousand dead in Cuba, the hapless prisoners in the Philippines, the  wretched _repatriados_ landed, cargo after cargo, at ports where some  were suffered to perish in the streets. Every household had its tale  of loss; yet, notwithstanding all the troubles of the time, Spain must  keep her Carnival. \"It is one of the saddest and most disheartening  features of the situation,\" said a Spaniard to us. \"There is no  earnestness here, no realization of the national crisis. The  politicians care for nothing but to enrich themselves, and the people,  as you see, care for nothing but to divert themselves.\"    Yet we looked from the madcap crowd to the closed shutters, keeping  their secrets of heartbreak, and remembered the words of Zorrilla,  \"Where there is one who laughs, there is ever another who weeps in the  great Carnival of our life.\"    The parks of San Sebastian were gay with maskers and music, tickling  brushes and showers of _confetti_, on our last day there, but the  peculiar feature of the festivity in this Basque city is \"the baiting  of the ox.\" On that Carnival-Sunday afternoon we found ourselves  looking down, from a safe balcony, upon the old _Plaza de la  Constitucion_, with its arcaded sides. The genuine bull-fights, which  used to take place here, have now a handsome amphitheatre of their  own, where, when the summer has brought the court to San Sebastian,  the choicest Andalusian bulls crimson the sand of the arena. But the  _Plaza de la Constitucion_, mindful of its pristine glory, still  furnishes what cheap suggestions it can of the terrible play. The  square below was crowded with men and boys, and even some hoydenish  girls, many in fantastic masks and gaudy dominos, while the tiers of  balconies were thronged with eager spectators. A strange and savage  peal of music announced that \"the bull\" was coming. That music was  enough to make the hereditary barbarian beat in any heart, but \"the  bull\"! At the further corner of the _plaza_, pulled by a long rope and  driven by a yelling rabble, came in, at a clumsy gallop, an astonished  and scandalized old ox. Never did living creature bear a meeker and  less resentful temper.    At first, beaten and pricked by his tormentors, he tore blindly round  and round the _plaza_, the long rope by which he was held dragging  behind him, and sometimes, as he wheeled about, tripping up and  overturning a bunch of the merrymakers. This was a joy to the  balconies, but did not often happen, as the people below showed a  marvellous dexterity in skipping over the rope just in time to escape  its swinging blow. Sometimes the poor, stupid beast entangled his own  legs, and that, too, was a source of noisy glee. But, on the whole,  he was a disappointing and inglorious ox. He caused no serious  accident. Nothing could ruffle his disposition. The scarlet cloaks  waved in his eyes he regarded with courteous interest; he wore only a  look of grieved surprise when he was slapped across the face with red  and yellow banners; tweaks of the tail he endured like a Socrates, but  now and then a cruel prod from a sharp stick would make him lower his  horns and rush, for an instant, upon the nearest offender. The  balconies would shout with the hope of something vicious and violent  at last, but the mobile crowd beneath would close in between the ox  and his assailant, a hundred fresh insults would divert his attention,  and indeed, his own impulses of wrath were of the shortest. To the end  he was hardly an angry ox--only a puzzled, baffled, weary old creature  who could not make out, for the life of him, into what sort of red and  yellow pasture and among what kind of buzzing hornets his unlucky  hoofs had strayed.    Finally he gave the enigma up and stood wrapped in a brown study among  his emboldened enemies, who clung to his horns and tail, tossed  children upon his back, tickled his nostrils with their hat brims, and  showered him with indignities. The balconies joined in hooting him out  of the _plaza_, but he was so pleased to go that I doubt if human  scorn of his beastly gentleness really interfered with his appetite  for supper. He trotted away to that rude clang of music, the babies  who were dancing to it on their nurses' arms not more harmless than  he. And although that worrying half hour may have told upon his  nerves, and his legs may have ached for the unaccustomed exercise, no  blood was to be seen upon him. It was all a rough-and-tumble romp,  nothing worse, but the balconies would have liked it better had it  been flavored with a broken leg or two. A few sprawlings over the rope  really amounted to so little. But the _toro de fuego_ was to come  there Tuesday evening, and when this blazing pasteboard bull, with  fireworks spluttering all over him from horns to tail, is dragged  about among the throng, there is always a fine chance of explosions,  burnings, and even of blindings for life.    But Carnival Tuesday found us no longer in sunny San Sebastian. We  were shivering over a _brasero_ in storied Burgos, a city chill as if  with the very breath of the past. And the Spanish _brasero_, a great  brass pan holding a pudding of ashes, plummed with sparks, under a  wire screen, is the coldest comfort, the most hypocritical heater,  that has yet come my way.    Our Monday had been spent in a marvellous journey through the  Pyrenees, whose rugged sublimities were bathed in the very blue of  Velazquez, a cold, clear, glorious blue expanding all the soul. These  are haunted mountains, with wild legends of lonely castles, where  fierce old chieftains, beaten back by the Franks, shut themselves in  with their treasure and died like wounded lions in their lairs. We  passed fallen towers from whose summits mediaeval heralds had trumpeted  the signal for war, ruined convents whence the sound of woman's  chanting was wont to startle the wolves of the forest, mysterious  lakes deep in whose waters are said to shine golden crowns set with  nine precious pearls--those ducal coronets that Rome bestowed upon her  vassals--craggy paths once trod by pilgrims, hermits, jugglers,  minstrels, and knights-errant, and shadowy pine groves where, when  the wind is high, the shepherds still hear the weeping ghost of the  cruel princess, whose beauty and disdain slew dozens of men a day  until her love was won and scorned, so that she died of longing.    We had reached Burgos at dusk and, without pausing for rest or food,  had sallied out for our first awe-stricken gaze up at the far-famed  cathedral towers, then had ignominiously lost our way over and over in  the narrow, crooked streets and been finally marched back to our hotel  by a compassionate, though contemptuous, policeman. My artist comrade  was fairly ill by morning with a heavy cold, but she would not hear of  missing the cathedral and sneezed three or four enraptured hours away  in its chill magnificence. As we came to know Spanish and Spaniards  better, they would exclaim \"_Jesus, Maria y Jose!_\" when we sneezed,  that the evil spirit given to tickling noses might take flight; but  the Burgos sacristan was too keen to waste these amenities on  stammering heretics. What we thought of the cathedral is little to the  purpose of this chapter. In a word, however, we thought nothing at  all; we only felt. It was our first introduction to one of the monster  churches of Spain, and its very greatness, the terrible weight of all  that antiquity, sanctity, and beauty, crushed our understanding. Like  sleepwalkers we followed our guide down the frozen length of nave and  aisles and cloisters; we went the round of the fifteen chapels,  splendid presence-chambers where the dead keep sculptured state; we  looked, as we were bidden, on the worm-eaten treasure-chest of the  Cid, on the clock whose life-sized tenant, Papa-Moscas, used to scream  the hours to the embarrassment of long-winded pulpiteers, on the  cathedral's crown of fretted spires whose marvellous tracery was  chiselled by the angels, and on the \"Most Holy Christ of Burgos,\" the  crucified image that bleeds every Friday.    Fulfilled with amazement, we searched our way back to the hotel  through the sleety rain, ate a shivering luncheon at the \"_mesa  redonda_,\" that \"round table\""]]]
