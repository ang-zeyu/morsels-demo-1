It came out that our young couple were  bride and groom. They had never seen each other until the night  before, having met through a matrimonial paper. They had met in Green  River and were married that morning, and the young husband was taking  her away up to Pinedale to his ranch.    They must have been ideally happy, for they had forgotten their  mess-box, and had only a light lunch. They had only their lap-robe for  bedding. They were in a predicament; but the girl's chief concern was  lest \"Honey-bug\" should let the wolves get her. Though it is scorching  hot on the desert by day, the nights are keenly cool, and I was  wondering how they would manage with only their lap-robe, when Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy, who cannot hold malice, made a round of the camp,  getting a blanket here and a coat there, until she had enough to make  them comfortable. Then she invited them to take their meals with us  until they could get to where they could help themselves.    I think we all enjoyed camp that night, for we were all tired. We were  in a shallow little canyon,--not a tree, not even a bush except  sage-brush. Luckily, there was plenty of that, so we had roaring  fires. We sat around the fire talking as the blue shadows faded into  gray dusk and the big stars came out. The newly-weds were, as the  bride put it, \"so full of happiness they had nothing to put it in.\"  Certainly their spirits overflowed. They were eager to talk of  themselves and we didn't mind listening.    They are Mr. and Mrs. Tom Burney. She is the oldest of a large family  of children and has had to \"work out ever since she was big enough to  get a job.\" The people she had worked for rather frowned upon any  matrimonial ventures, and as no provision was made for \"help\"  entertaining company, she had never had a \"beau.\" One day she got hold  of a matrimonial paper and saw Mr. Burney's ad. She answered and they  corresponded for several months. We were just in time to \"catch it,\"  as Mr. Haynes--who is a confirmed bachelor--disgustedly remarked.  Personally, I am glad; I like them much better than I thought I should  when they were raising so much dust so unnecessarily.    I must close this letter, as I see the men are about ready to  start. The children are standing the trip well, except that Robert  is a little sun-blistered. Did I tell you we left Junior with his  grandmother? Even though I have the other three, my heart is hungry  for my \"big boy,\" who is only a baby, too. He is such a precious  little man. I wish you could see him!    With a heart very full of love for you,                                  E. R. S.          III    EDEN VALLEY                                    IN CAMP, August 28.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    We are almost across the desert, and I am really becoming interested.  The difficulties some folks work under are enough to make many of us  ashamed. In the very center of the desert is a little settlement  called Eden Valley. Imagination must have had a heap to do with its  name, but one thing is certain: the serpent will find the crawling  rather bad if he attempts to enter _this_ Eden, for the sand is hot;  the alkali and the cactus are there, so it must be a serpentless Eden.  The settlers have made a long canal and bring their water many miles.  They say the soil is splendid, and they don't have much stone; but it  is such a flat place! I wonder how they get the water to run when they  irrigate.    We saw many deserted homes. Hope's skeletons they are, with their  yawning doors and windows like eyeless sockets. Some of the houses,  which looked as if they were deserted, held families. We camped near  one such. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and I went up to the house to buy some  eggs. A hopeless-looking woman came to the door. The hot winds and the  alkali dust had tanned her skin and bleached her hair; both were a  gray-brown. Her eyes were blue, but were so tired-looking that I could  hardly see for the tears.    \"No,\" she said, \"we ain't got no eggs. We ain't got no chickens. You  see this ground is sandy, and last year the wind blowed awful hard and  all the grain blowed out, so we didn't have no chance to raise  chickens. We had no feed and no money to buy feed, so we had to kill  our chickens to save their lives. We et 'em. They would have starved  anyway.\"    Then we tried for some vegetables. \"Well,\" she said, \"they ain't much  to look at; maybe you'll not want 'em. Our garden ain't much this  year. Pa has had to work out all the time. The kids and me put in some  seed--all we had--with a hoe. We ain't got no horse; our team died  last winter. We didn't have much feed and it was shore a hard winter.  We hated to see old Nick and Fanny die. They were just like ones of  the family. We drove 'em clean from Missouri, too. But they died, and  what hurt me most was, pa 'lowed it would be a turrible waste not to  skin 'em. I begged him not to. Land knows the pore old things was  entitled to their hides, they got so little else; but pa said it  didn't make no difference to them whether they had any hide or not,  and that the skins would sell for enough to get the kids some shoes.  And they did. A Jew junk man came through and give pa three dollars  for the two hides, and that paid for a pair each for Johnny and Eller.    \"Pa hated as bad as we did to lose our faithful old friends, and all  the winter long we grieved, the kids and me. Every time the coyotes  yelped we knew they were gathering to gnaw poor old Nick and Fan's  bones. And pa, to keep from crying himself when the kids and me would  be sobbin', would scold us. 'My goodness,' he would say, 'the horses  are dead and they don't know nothin' about cold and hunger. They don't  know nothin' about sore shoulders and hard pulls now, so why don't you  shut up and let them and me rest in peace?' But that was only pa's way  of hidin' the tears.    \"When spring came the kids and me gathered all the bones and hair we  could find of our good old team, and buried 'em where you see that  green spot. That's grass. We scooped all the trash out of the mangers,  and spread it over the grave, and the timothy and the redtop seed in  the trash came up and growed. I'd liked to have put some flowers  there, but we had no seed.\"    She wiped her face on her apron, and gathered an armful of cabbage;  it had not headed but was the best she had. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy seemed  possessed; she bought stuff she knew she would have to throw away, but  she didn't offer one word of sympathy. I felt plumb out of patience  with her, for usually she can say the most comforting things.    \"Why don't you leave this place? Why not go away somewhere else, where  it will not be so hard to start?\" I asked.    \"Oh, 'cause pa's heart is just set on making a go of it here, and we  would be just as pore anywhere else. We have tried a heap of times to  start a home, and we've worked hard, but we were never so pore before.  We have been here three years and we can prove up soon; then maybe we  can go away and work somewhere, enough to get a team anyway. Pa has  already worked out his water-right,--he's got water for all his land  paid for, if we only had a team to plough with. But we'll get it. Pa's  been workin' all summer in the hay, and he ought to have a little  stake saved. Then the sheep-men will be bringin' in their herds  soon's frost comes and pa 'lows to get a job herdin'. Anyway, we got  to stick. We ain't got no way to get away and all we got is right  here. Every last dollar we had has went into improvin' this place. If  pore old hard-worked pa can stand it, the kids and me can. We ain't  seen pa for two months, not sence hayin' began, but we work all we can  to shorten the days; and we sure do miss pore old Nick and Fan.\"    We gathered up as much of the vegetables as we could carry. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy paid, and we started homeward, promising to send for the  rest of the beets and potatoes. On the way we met two children, and  knew them at once for \"Johnny and Eller.\" They had pails, and were  carrying water from the stream and pouring it on the green spot that  covered Nick and Fan. We promised them each a dime if they would bring  the vegetables we had left. Their little faces shone, and we had to  hurry all we could to get supper ready before they came; for we were  determined they should eat supper with us.    We told the men before the little tykes came. So Mr. Struble let  Johnny shoot his gun and both youngsters rode Chub and Antifat to  water. They were bright little folks and their outlook upon life is  not so flat and colorless as their mother's is. A day holds a world of  chance for them. They were saving their money, they told us, \"to buy  some house plants for ma.\" Johnny had a dollar which a sheep-man had  given him for taking care of a sore-footed dog. Ella had a dime which  a man had given her for filling his water-bag. They both hoped to pull  wool off dead sheep and make some more money that way. They had quite  made up their minds about what they wanted to get: it must be house  plants for ma; but still they both wished they could get some little  thing for pa. They were not pert or forward in any way, but they  answered readily and we all drew them out, even the newly-weds.    After supper the men took their guns and went out to shoot sage-hens.  Johnny went with Mr. Haynes and Mr. Struble. Miss Hull walked back  with Ella, and we sent Mrs. Sanders a few cans of fruit. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy and I washed the dishes. We were talking of the Sanders  family. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was disgusted with me because I wept.    \"You think it is a soft heart you have, but it is only your head that  is soft. Of course they are having a hard time. What of it? The very  root of independence is hard times. That's the way America was  founded; that is why it stands so firmly.

Let those who extend that promise to themselves meet the  Catholics' argument upon it and save themselves if they can. We now enjoy  the Spirit of God through faith along with all the beneficial, practical  and comforting and redeeming results of the baptism of the apostles and  first Christians in the Holy Spirit. What more do we need? Faith lays hold  upon Christ; upon the Holy Spirit; and upon God. The just live by faith,  and drink of the rivers that flow from the great fountain of the Holy  Spirit, which was created in the hearts of the apostles and New Testament  teachers. The effects of their baptism in the Spirit are ours through  faith. And all the world may have them through faith. They are free to  all. The government of God is now set up. Order and law reigns throughout.  Jesus said, \"So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into  the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should  spring and grow up, he knoweth not how, for the earth bringeth forth fruit  of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the  ear.\" The kingdom of God now bringeth forth fruit of herself, the good  seed, the word of God, having been cast into it. Its glorious blessings  are open to all men. The prophet says: \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come  ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come, ye, buy, and eat; yea,  come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye  spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which  satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good,  and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come  unto me; hear, and your soul shall live.... Let the wicked forsake his  way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the  Lord and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will  abundantly pardon.\" \"The Spirit and the bride say come, and let him that  is athirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the waters of life  freely.\" Yes, _freely_. There is no obstruction. All are without excuse.            CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST.      Our senses are the means by which we were made competent witnesses. They  are the bed-rock of evidence. We know facts and truths, both  comprehensible and incomprehensible, by the same means. We are as  competent to testify of that which we do not comprehend as we are to  testify of the most ordinary fact. As competent to bear testimony to the  fact of a sweeping tornado as to the fact of a gentle breeze. As competent  to bear testimony to the fact that water freezes and becomes hard as to  testify to the truth of its being a fluid. As competent to testify to a  fact that we never before experienced as to one that we have. Without this  competency no man could be justly held responsible for slander or perjury.    We gain knowledge by means of our senses, and all lying and perjury is  outside of our senses, having no connection with them. We can, in truth,  testify to that which we have seen, heard, tasted, smelt or felt, and to  such only. That which somebody else thus witnessed may be testified by  him, but not by me, unless I, too, was connected with it by means of my  senses. Wise men may be deceived in some things, but fools can not be  deceived in others. Things addressing themselves to our senses are things  about which we can not be so deceived as to truthfully deny that they ever  occurred. I know a live man when I see him by the same means I know a dead  man.    Being competent to bear witness to a new fact, to one heretofore  unexperienced, I would have been competent to bear witness to the death,  burial and resurrection of the Christ, in case I had lived in his day, and  had been as familiar with him as his witnesses. By which I mean to say,  they were competent witnesses; every way qualified to know assuredly  whether the Savior rose from the dead. _They could not be deceived_ about  the matter. They were not. If they were honest men they told the truth,  for they say, We saw, and heard, and our hands have handled. Then the  entire Christian religion, with its immortal blessings, stands or falls  upon the honesty of the Savior's witnesses. Martyrdom has been universally  conceded to be an evidence of sincerity; there may be a few exceptions to  this general rule, but even they are not parallel cases. There is a story  of a man who endured with great fortitude all the tortures of the rack,  denying the fact with which he was charged. When he was asked afterwards  how he could hold out against all the tortures, he said: I painted a  gallows on the toe of my shoe, and when the rack stretched me, I looked on  the gallows, and bore the pain to save my life. This man denied a plain  fact under torture, but he did it to save his life.    When criminals persist in denying their crimes they do it with the hope of  saving their lives. Such cases are not parallel. Who ever heard of persons  dying _willingly_ in attestation of a false fact? Can we be made to  believe that any set of rational men could be found who would _willingly  die_ in attestation of the false fact that the President of the United  States is now on the throne of England? The witnesses of Christ died in  attestation of those facts which they say they saw, and heard, and knew,  among which was the great fact of the resurrection of Christ. It was their  privilege to quit their evidence, at any instant, and save their lives,  but they did not do it. Who can account for this strange course of conduct  upon the ground of dishonesty?    If a man reports an uncommon fact that is a plain object of sense, and we  do not believe him, it is because we suspect his honesty and not his  senses. If we are satisfied that the reporter is sincere, of course we  believe. So our case is now in this shape: First, the great facts of the  gospel of Christ addressed themselves, as simple facts, to the senses of  men; second, no witness could affirm those facts honestly unless they took  place; third, the witnesses to those facts gave all the evidences of  sincerity and honesty that are possible. Reputation for truthfulness and  honesty has never rested upon any evidence that is not found in great  abundance in the lives of the witnesses of Christ. It is said that men die  for false opinions: very true, but their sufferings and death,  nevertheless, prove that they were sincere. True philosophy does not  charge men who die for their opinions with dishonesty. Men may be mistaken  in some things, but mistaken men are _not cheats_; are not insincere or  dishonest. But the witnesses of Christ could not, in the nature of the  case, belong to this class; they could not be mistaken about any such  facts as those of the gospel. The only fort to be held in order to hold  the gospel of Christ is the sincerity of his witnesses. When a man gets  rid of the evidence upon which the reputation of those witnesses for  honesty rests, he has removed the only evidence upon which it is possible  for him to build a reputation for truth and honesty. So, if a man succeeds  in sinking the gospel of Christ, he succeeds, at the same time and by the  same means, in sinking himself. This is the philosophic and logical  conclusion, from which there is no escape.    Let us look around one of the Savior's witnesses and see what we can  discover. First, we find Saul, a bold and fearless Jew, a Roman citizen by  birth, and a pharisee in the Jews religion; a legalist by profession;  laboring under all the prejudices of the straitest sect of the pharisees;  persecuting the Savior's disciples to the death. He was a man of no mean  attainments. His worldly prospects were greater than those of any other  man known to be converted from among the Jews. The testimony which he  submits for our consideration is like the evidence of all the others. It  consists in simple facts about which there was no possibility of being  mistaken, for the facts were seen and heard. Allowing that Saul did  neither see nor hear the Savior, he was insincere. And if he was, then we  shall always be at a loss to know what constitutes the basis of an honest  reputation. Did he give his evidence, knowing that it was false, with the  intention of deceiving? If so, what were his motives? He could have had no  reasonable inducements. Christianity could not furnish him with temporal  power, credit, or interest during all his lifetime. So far as credit was  concerned, in the affair of his conversion, he knew that the world had  none to give. He knew that preaching Christ crucified was \"to the Jews a  stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness.\" He knew that the Christ  himself had been crucified. Credit or reputation was lying upon the  anti-christian side of the gospel. He was already in high esteem among the  Jews; a \"_ring-leader_,\" pursuing the course of action calculated in the  very nature of things to advance him higher in their estimation. His  entire life demonstrated the fact that he expected nothing of the Jews,  for it was spent, with trifling exceptions, among the Gentiles. His  enterprise was with them, for he was sent to them.    The difficulties lying in the way of any worldly emoluments were many and  great. He had to contend with the authority and policy of the rulers; with  the interest, credit and clique of the priests; with the prejudices and  passions of the people; with the shrewdness and pride of the philosophers.  Every man acquainted with ancient history knows that the established  religion with which he would necessarily come in conflict, was interwoven  with their civil institution, and supported by the rulers as _an  essential_ part of"]]]
