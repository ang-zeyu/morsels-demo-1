The truth is that many girls who have been taught in the \"ologies\" of  the schools, who have been trained in the conventionalities of  society, have been left to pick up as they may their ideas upon  personal conduct, and, coming face to face with puzzling problems, are  at a loss, and perhaps are led into wrong ways of thinking and  questionable ways of doing because no one has foreseen their dilemma  and warned them how to meet it.    The subjects treated in this little book are discussed because every  one of them has been the substance of a query propounded by some girl  otherwise intelligent and well informed. They have been treated  plainly and simply because they purport to be the frank conferences of  a mother and daughter, between whom there can be no need of hesitation  in dealing frankly with any question bearing on the life, health or  happiness of the girl. There is therefore no need of apology; the book  is its own excuse for being, the queries of the young women demand  honest answers.    Life will be safer for the girl who understands her own nature and  reverences her womanhood, who realizes her responsibility towards the  human race and conducts herself in accordance with that realization.    Life will be nobler and purer in its possession and its transmission,  if, from childhood onward to old age, the thought has been held that  \"Life is a gift of God and is divine,\" and its physical is no less  sacred than its mental or moral manifestation; if it has been  understood that the foundations of character are laid in the habits  formed in youth, and that a noble girlhood assures a grand maturity.    Dear girls who read this book, the mother-heart has gone out to you  with great tenderness with every line herein written, with many an  unspoken prayer that you will be helped, uplifted, inspired by its  reading, and made more and more to feel        \"A sacred burden is this life ye bear.      Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly;      Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly;      Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,      But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.\"                          MARY WOOD-ALLEN.      ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.          PART I.    THE VALUE OF HEALTH, AND RESPONSIBILITY IN MAINTAINING IT.          WHAT A YOUNG WOMAN OUGHT TO KNOW.          CHAPTER I.    WHAT ARE YOU WORTH?      MY DAUGHTER DEAR:    When I see you with your young girl friends, when I look into your  bright faces and listen to your merry laughter and your girlish  chatter, I wonder if any one of you understands how much you are  worth. Now you may say, \"I haven't any money in the bank, I have no  houses or land, I am worth nothing,\" but that would only be detailing  what you possess. It is not what you possess but what you are that  determines what you are worth. One may possess much wealth and be  worth very little.    I was reading the other day that the first great lesson for a _young  man_ to learn, the first fact to realize, is that he is of some  importance; that upon his wisdom, energy and faithfulness all else  depends, and that the world cannot get along without him. Now if this  is true of young men, I do not see why it is not equally true of young  women.    It is not after you have grown old that you will be of value to the  world; it is now, in your young days, while you are laying the  foundation of your character, that you are of great importance. We  cannot say that the foundation is of no importance until the building  is erected, for upon the right placing of the foundation depends the  firmness and stability of the superstructure. Dr. Conwell, in his  little book, \"Manhood's Morning,\" estimates that there are twelve  million young men in the United States between fourteen and  twenty-eight years of age; that these twelve million young men  represent latent physical force enough to dig the iron ore from the  mines, manufacture it into wire, lay the foundation and construct  completely the great Brooklyn Bridge in three hours; that they  represent force enough, if rightly utilized, to dig the clay from the  earth, manufacture the bricks and construct the great Chinese Wall in  five days. If each one were to build himself a house twenty-five feet  wide, these houses would line both sides of eight streets reaching  across the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. For each one to  be sick one day is equal to thirty thousand being sick an entire year.    Now, if there are twelve million young men in the United States, we  may estimate that there are an equal number of young women. Although  we cannot calculate accurately the amount of physical force  represented by these young women, there are some things we can tell.  We know that for each one of these young women to be sick one day  means thirty thousand sick one year. Just imagine the loss to the  country, and the gain to posterity if it can be prevented!    Rome endeavored to create good soldiery, but was not able to produce  strength and courage through physical culture of the men alone. Not  until she began the physical education of the women, the young women,  was she able to insure to the nation a race of strong, hardy, vigorous  soldiery. So the health of the young women of to-day is of great  importance to the nation, for upon their vigor and soundness of body  depend to a very great extent the health and capacity of future  generations. We are told that in the State of Massachusetts, in one  year, there were lost twenty-eight thousand five hundred (28,500)  years of time through the illness of working-people by preventable  diseases. Dr. Buck, in his \"Hygiene,\" tells us that one hundred  thousand persons die every year through preventable diseases, that one  hundred and fifty thousand are constantly sick through preventable  diseases, and that the loss to the nation, through the illness of  working-people by diseases that might have been prevented, is more  than a hundred million dollars a year. So we can see that each  individual has a pecuniary value to the nation. You are worth just as  much to the nation as you can earn. If you earn a dollar a day, you  are not only worth a dollar a day to yourself and to your personal  employer, but you are worth a dollar a day to the nation; and if,  through illness, you are laid aside for one day, the nation, as well  as yourself, is pecuniarily the loser.    Young women could not build the houses that would line eight streets  from New York to San Francisco, but, rightly educated, they could  convert each one of these houses into a home, and to found a home and  conduct it properly is to help the world. It is so easy to measure  what is done with physical strength. We can see what men are doing  when they build railroads, construct immense bridges and towering  buildings, but it is more difficult to measure what is done through  intellectual and spiritual forces; and woman's work in the world is  not so much the using of strength as it is the using of those finer  forces which go to build up men and women. With this thought in your  mind, can you answer the question, How much are you worth? How much  are you worth to yourself? How much are you worth in your home? How  much money would your parents be willing to accept in place of  yourself? How much are you worth to the community in which you live?  How much are you worth to the state, the nation, the human race?    You can recognize your value in the home when you remember how much  you are the center of all that goes on there, how much your interest  is consulted in everything that is done by father and mother. You can  realize your value to the state when you realize how much money is  spent for the education of young people, how cultured men and women  give the best of their lives to your instruction. You cannot measure  your value to the human race until you begin to think that the young  people of to-day are creating the condition of the world in fifty or  one hundred years to come; that you, through your physical health, or  lack of it, are to become a source of strength or weakness in future  years, if you are a mother. It is all right that young women should  think of marriage and motherhood, provided they think of it in the  right way.    I want you to reverence yourself, to realize your own importance, to  feel that you are a necessity to God's perfect plan. When we are young  and feel that we are of no account in the world, it is difficult to  realize that God's complete plan cannot be carried out without us. The  smallest, tiniest rivet or bolt may be of such great importance in the  construction of an engine that its loss means the incapacity of that  piece of machinery to do its work. As God has placed you in the world,  He has placed you here to do a specific work for Him and for  humanity, and your failure to do that work means the failure of His  complete and perfect plan. Now can you begin to see how much you are  worth? And can you begin to realize that in the conduct of your life  as a young woman you are a factor of immense importance to the great  problem of the evolution of the human race? In the light of these  thoughts I would like to have you ask yourself this question every  day, How much am I worth?          CHAPTER II.    CARE OF BODY.      The question \"How much are you worth?\" is not answered by discussing  your bodily conditions, for your body is not yourself. It is your  dwelling, but not you. It, however, expresses you.    A man builds a house, and through it expresses himself. The external  appearance causes the observer to form an opinion of him, and each  apartment bears the impress of his individuality. To look at the house  and then to walk through it will tell you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#3)"],[1,"Jews of Caesarea, being many ten  thousands, with their wives and children, and all in one day, he called  to him Equiculus Modius, and sent him to be Varus's successor, as we  have elsewhere related. But still Philip kept possession of the citadel  of Gamala, and of the country adjoining to it, which thereby continued  in their allegiance to the Romans.    12. Now, as soon as I was come into Galilee, and had learned this state  of things by the information of such as told me of them, I wrote to the  sanhedrim at Jerusalem about them, and required their direction what I  should do. Their direction was, that I should continue there, and that,  if my fellow legates were willing, I should join with them in the care  of Galilee. But those my fellow legates, having gotten great riches from  those tithes which as priests were their dues, and were given to them,  determined to return to their own country. Yet when I desired them  to stay so long, that we might first settle the public affairs, they  complied with me. So I removed, together with them, from the city of  Sepphoris, and came to a certain village called Bethmaus, four furlongs  distant from Tiberius; and thence I sent messengers to the senate of  Tiberius, and desired that the principal men of the city would come to  me: and when they were come, Justus himself being also with them, I told  them that I was sent to them by the people of Jerusalem as a legate,  together with these other priests, in order to persuade them to demolish  that house which Herod the tetrarch had built there, and which had the  figures of living creatures in it, although our laws have forbidden us  to make any such figures; and I desired that they would give us leave so  to do immediately. But for a good while Capellus and the principal  men belonging to the city would not give us leave, but were at length  entirely overcome by us, and were induced to be of our opinion. So Jesus  the son of Sapphias, one of those whom we have already mentioned as the  leader of a seditious tumult of mariners and poor people, prevented us,  and took with him certain Galileans, and set the entire palace on fire,  and thought he should get a great deal of money thereby, because he saw  some of the roofs gilt with gold. They also plundered a great deal of  the furniture, which was done without our approbation; for after we had  discoursed with Capellus and the principal men of the city, we departed  from Bethmaus, and went into the Upper Galilee. But Jesus and his party  slew all the Greeks that were inhabitants of Tiberias, and as many  others as were their enemies before the war began.    13. When I understood this state of things, I was greatly provoked,  and went down to Tiberias, and took all the care I could of the royal  furniture, to recover all that could be recovered from such as had  plundered it. They consisted of candlesticks made of Corinthian brass,  and of royal tables, and of a great quantity of uncoined silver; and I  resolved to preserve whatsoever came to my hand for the king. So I sent  for ten of the principal men of the senate, and for Capellus the son of  Antyllus, and committed the furniture to them, with this charge, That  they should part with it to nobody else but to myself. From thence I  and my fellow legates went to Gichala, to John, as desirous to know his  intentions, and soon saw that he was for innovations, and had a mind to  the principality; for he desired me to give him authority to carry off  that corn which belonged to Caesar, and lay in the villages of Upper  Galilee; and he pretended that he would expend what it came to in  building the walls of his own city. But when I perceived what he  endeavored at, and what he had in his mind, I said I would not permit  him so to do; for that I thought either to keep it for the Romans or for  myself, now I was intrusted with the public affairs there by the people  of Jerusalem. But, when he was not able to prevail with me, he betook  himself to my fellow legates; for they had no sagacity in providing for  futurity, and were very ready to take bribes. So he corrupted them with  money to decree, That all that corn which was within his province should  be delivered to him; while I, who was but one, was outvoted by two, and  held my tongue. Then did John introduce another cunning contrivance of  his; for he said that those Jews who inhabited Cesarea Philippi, and  were shut up by the order of the king's deputy there, had sent to him to  desire him, that, since they had no oil that was pure for their use,  he would provide a sufficient quantity of such oil for them, lest they  should be forced to make use of oil that came from the Greeks, and  thereby transgress their own laws. Now this was said by John, not out of  his regard to religion, but out of his most flagrant desire of gain;  for he knew that two sextaries were sold with them of Caesarea for one  drachma, but that at Gischala fourscore sextaxies were sold for four  sextaries. So he gave order that all the oil which was there should be  carried away, as having my permission for so doing; which yet I did not  grant him voluntarily, but only out of fear of the multitude, since,  if I had forbidden him, I should have been stoned by them. When I had  therefore permitted this to be done by John, he gained vast sums of  money by this his knavery.    14. But when I had dismissed my fellow legates, and sent them back to  Jerusalem, I took care to have arms provided, and the cities fortified.  And when I had sent for the most hardy among the robbers, I saw that it  was not in my power to take their arms from them; but I persuaded the  multitude to allow them money as pay, and told them it was better for  them to give them a little willingly, rather than to [be forced to]  overlook them when they plundered their goods from them. And when I had  obliged them to take an oath not to come into that country, unless they  were invited to come, or else when they had not their pay given them, I  dismissed them, and charged them neither to make an expedition against  the Romans, nor against those their neighbors that lay round about them;  for my first care was to keep Galilee in peace. So I was willing to have  the principal of the Galileans, in all seventy, as hostages for their  fidelity, but still under the notion of friendship. Accordingly, I made  them my friends and companions as I journeyed, and set them to judge  causes; and with their approbation it was that I gave my sentences,  while I endeavored not to mistake what justice required, and to keep my  hands clear of all bribery in those determinations.    15. I was now about the thirtieth year of my age; in which time of life  it is a hard thing for any one to escape the calumnies of the envious,  although he restrain himself from fulfilling any unlawful desires,  especially where a person is in great authority. Yet did I preserve  every woman free from injuries; and as to what presents were offered  me, I despised them, as not standing in need of them. Nor indeed would  I take those tithes, which were due to me as a priest, from those that  brought them. Yet do I confess, that I took part of the spoils of those  Syrians which inhabited the cities that adjoined to us, when I had  conquered them, and that I sent them to my kindred at Jerusalem;  although, when I twice took Sepphoris by force, and Tiberias four times,  and Gadara once, and when I had subdued and taken John, who often laid  treacherous snares for me, I did not punish [with death] either him  or any of the people forenamed, as the progress of this discourse will  show. And on this account, I suppose, it was that God, [10] who is never  unacquainted with those that do as they ought to do, delivered me still  out of the hands of these my enemies, and afterwards preserved me when I  fell into those many dangers which I shall relate hereafter.    16. Now the multitude of the Galileans had that great kindness for me,  and fidelity to me, that when their cities were taken by force, and  their wives and children carried into slavery, they did not so deeply  lament for their own calamities, as they were solicitous for my  preservation. But when John saw this, he envied me, and wrote to me,  desiring that I would give him leave to come down, and make use of  the hot-baths of Tiberias for the recovery of the health of his body.  Accordingly, I did not hinder him, as having no suspicion of any  wicked designs of his; and I wrote to those to whom I had committed  the administration of the affairs of Tiberius by name, that they should  provide a lodging for John, and for such as should come with him, and  should procure him what necessaries soever he should stand in need of.  Now at this time my abode was in a village of Galilee, which is named  Cans.    17. But when John was come to the city of Tiberias, he persuaded the men  to revolt from their fidelity to me, and to adhere to him; and many  of them gladly received that invitation of his, as ever fond of  innovations, and by nature disposed to changes, and delighting in  seditions; but they were chiefly Justus and his father Pistus, that were  earnest for their revolt from me, and their adherence to John. But I  came upon them, and prevented them; for a messenger had come to me from  Silas, whom I had made governor of Tiberias, as I have said already, and  had told me of the inclinations of the people of Tiberias, and advised  me to make haste thither; for that, if I made any delay, the city would  come under another's jurisdiction. Upon the receipt of this letter of  Silas, I took two hundred men along with me, and traveled all night,  having sent before a messenger to let the people of Tiberias know that I  was coming to them. When I came near to the city, which was early in the  morning, the multitude came out to meet me; and John came with them,  and saluted me, but in a most disturbed manner, as being afraid that my  "]]]
