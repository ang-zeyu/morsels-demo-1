It is of great importance you should clearly understand these teachings  of Galen, because, as I said just now, they sum up all that anybody knew  until the revival of learning; and they come to this--that the blood  having passed from the stomach and intestines through the liver, and  having entered the great veins, was by them distributed to every part of  the body; that part of the blood, thus distributed, entered the arterial  system by the 'anastomoses', as Galen called them, in the lungs; that  a very small portion of it entered the arteries by the 'anastomoses' in  the body generally; but that the greater part of it passed through the  septum of the heart, and so entered the left side and mingled with the  pneumatised blood, which had been subjected to the air in the lungs,  and was then distributed by the arteries, and eventually mixed with the  currents of blood, coming the other way, through the veins.    Yet one other point about the views of Galen. He thought that both the  contractions and dilatations of the heart--what we call the 'systole'  or contraction of the heart, and the 'diastole' or dilatation--Galen  thought that these were both active movements; that the heart actively  dilated, so that it had a sort of sucking power upon the fluids which  had access to it. And again, with respect to the movements of the pulse,  which anybody can feel at the wrist and elsewhere, Galen was of opinion  that the walls of the arteries partook of that which he supposed to be  the nature of the walls of the heart, and that they had the power of  alternately actively contracting and actively dilating, so that he is  careful to say that the nature of the pulse is comparable, not to the  movement of a bag, which we fill by blowing into it, and which we empty  by drawing the air out of it, but to the action of a bellows, which is  actively dilated and actively compressed.    Fig 3.--The course of the blood from the right to the left side of the  heart (Realdus Columbus, 1559).    After Galen's time came the collapse of the Roman Empire, the extinction  of physical knowledge, and the repression of every kind of scientific  inquiry, by its powerful and consistent enemy, the Church; and that  state of things lasted until the latter part of the Middle Ages saw the  revival of learning. That revival of learning, so far as anatomy  and physiology are concerned, is due to the renewed influence of  the philosophers of ancient Greece, and indeed, of Galen. Arabic  commentators had translated Galen, and portions of his works had got  into the language of the learned in the Middle Ages, in that way;  but, by the study of the classical languages, the original text became  accessible to the men who were then endeavouring to learn for themselves  something about the facts of nature. It was a century or more before  these men, finding themselves in the presence of a master--finding that  all their lives were occupied in attempting to ascertain for themselves  that which was familiar to him--I say it took the best part of a hundred  years before they could fairly see that their business was not to follow  him, but to follow his example--namely, to look into the facts of nature  for themselves, and to carry on, in his spirit, the work he had begun.  That was first done by Vesalius, one of the greatest anatomists who ever  lived; but his work does not specially bear upon the question we are  now concerned with. So far as regards the motions of the heart and the  course of the blood, the first man in the Middle Ages, and indeed the  only man who did anything which was of real importance, was one Realdus  Columbus, who was professor at Padua in the year 1559, and published a  great anatomical treatise. What Realdus Columbus did was this; once  more resorting to the method of Galen, turning to the living animal,  experimenting, he came upon new facts, and one of these new facts was  that there was not merely a subordinate communication between the blood  of the right side of the heart and that of the left side of the heart,  through the lungs, but that there was a constant steady current of  blood, setting through the pulmonary artery on the right side, through  the lungs, and back by the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart  (Fig.3). Such was the capital discovery and demonstration of Realdus  Columbus. He is the man who discovered what is loosely called the  'pulmonary circulation'; and it really is quite absurd, in the face of  the fact, that twenty years afterwards we find Ambrose Pare, the great  French surgeon, ascribing this discovery to him as a matter of common  notoriety, to find that attempts are made to give the credit of it to  other people. So far as I know, this discovery of the course of the  blood through the lungs, which is called the pulmonary circulation, is  the one step in real advance that was made between the time of Galen  and the time of Harvey. And I would beg you to note that the word  \"circulation\" is improperly employed when it is applied to the course of  the blood through the lungs. The blood from the right side of the  heart, in getting to the left side of the heart, only performs a  half-circle--it does not perform a whole circle--it does not return  to the place from whence it started; and hence the discovery of the  so-called \"pulmonary circulation\" has nothing whatever to do with that  greater discovery which I shall point out to you by-and-by was made  by Harvey, and which is alone really entitled to the name of the  circulation of the blood.    If anybody wants to understand what Harvey's great desert really was,  I would suggest to him that he devote himself to a course of reading,  which I cannot promise shall be very entertaining, but which, in this  respect at any rate, will be highly instructive--namely, the works of  the anatomists of the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning  of the 17th century. If anybody will take the trouble to do that which  I have thought it my business to do, he will find that the doctrines  respecting the action of the heart and the motion of the blood which  were taught in every university in Europe, whether in Padua or in Paris,  were essentially those put forward by Galen, 'plus' the discovery of the  pulmonary course of the blood which had been made by Realdus Columbus.  In every chair of anatomy and physiology (which studies were not then  separated) in Europe, it was taught that the blood brought to the liver  by the portal vein, and carried out of the liver to the 'vena cava'  by the hepatic vein, is distributed from the right side of the heart,  through the other veins, to all parts of the body; that the blood of the  arteries takes a like course from the heart towards the periphery; and  that it is there, by means of the 'anastomoses', more or less mixed up  with the venous blood. It so happens, by a curious chance, that up to  the year 1625 there was at Padua, which was Harvey's own university, a  very distinguished professor, Spigelius, whose work is extant, and who  teaches exactly what I am now telling you. It is perfectly true  that, some time before, Harvey's master, Fabricius, had not only  re-discovered, but had drawn much attention to certain pouch-like  structures, which are called the valves of the veins, found in the  muscular parts of the body, all of which are directed towards the heart,  and consequently impede the flow of the blood in the opposite direction.  And you will find it stated by people who have not thought much about  the matter, that it was this discovery of the valves of the veins which  led Harvey to imagine the course of the circulation of the blood. Now  it did not lead Harvey to imagine anything of the kind. He had heard  all about it from his master, Fabricius, who made a great point of  these valves in the veins, and he had heard the theories which Fabricius  entertained upon the subject, whose impression as to the use of the  valves was simply this--that they tended to take off any excess of  pressure of the blood in passing from the heart to the extremities; for  Fabricius believed, with the rest of the world, that the blood in the  veins flowed from the heart towards the extremities. This, under the  circumstances, was as good a theory as any other, because the action of  the valves depends altogether upon the form and nature of the walls  of the structures in which they are attached; and without accurate  experiment, it was impossible to say whether the theory of Fabricius  was right or wrong. But we not only have the evidence of the facts  themselves that these could tell Harvey nothing about the circulation,  but we have his own distinct declaration as to the considerations which  led him to the true theory of the circulation of the blood, and amongst  these the valves of the veins are not mentioned.    Fig. 4.--The circulation of the blood as demonstrated by Harvey (A.D.  1628).    Now then we may come to Harvey himself. When you read Harvey's treatise,  which is one of the most remarkable scientific monographs with which I  am acquainted--it occupies between 50 and 60 pages of a small quarto in  Latin, and is as terse and concise as it possibly can be--when you come  to look at Harvey's work, you will find that he had long struggled with  the difficulties of the accepted doctrine of the circulation. He had  received from Fabricius, and from all the great authorities of the day,  the current view of the circulation of the blood. But he was a man  with that rarest of all qualities--intellectual honesty; and by dint of  cultivating that great faculty, which is more moral than intellectual,  it had become impossible for him to say he believed anything which he  did not clearly believe. This is a most uncomfortable peculiarity--for  it gets you into all sorts of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#3)"],[1,"of these  social opportunities will be much more general if the public highways  are at all times in a condition to be traveled in comfort. Good homes  and good schools on good roads are prerequisites to the solution of  many rural problems.    If there is opportunity for those who live in the cities to get some  adequate idea of rural life and the conditions under which farming  operations are carried on it will correct many misunderstandings of  the broad problems of food production and distribution. Reference has  frequently been made to the seeming desire on the part of city people  to get into the country, and, by facilitating the realization of this  desire, a great social service is rendered.    =Good Roads and Commerce.=--That good highways are almost as necessary  as are railroads to the commercial development of a nation is  recognized but, unlike the railroads, the highways are not operated  for direct profit and the responsibility of securing consideration of  the demand for improvements is not centralized. Therefore, sentiment  for road improvement has been of slow growth, and important projects  are often delayed until long after the need for them was manifest.  Movements to secure financial support for highway improvement must go  through the slow process of legislative enactment, encountering all of  the uncertainties of political action, and the resulting financial  plan is likely to be inadequate and often inequitable.    The whole commercial structure of a nation rests upon transportation,  and the highways are a part of the transportation system. The highway  problem can never receive adequate consideration until public highways  are recognized as an indispensable element in the business equipment  of a nation.    During the World War all transportation facilities were taxed to the  limit, and motor trucks were utilized for long distance freight  haulage to an extent not previously considered practicable. As a  result, the interest in the motor truck as an addition to the  transportation equipment of the nation, has been greatly stimulated.  Many haulage companies have entered the freight transportation field,  delivering commodities by truck to distances of a hundred miles or  more.    The part the motor truck will play in the future can only be  estimated, but it seems clear that the most promising field is for  shipments destined to or originating in a city of some size and a  warehouse or store not on a railroad spur, and especially when the  shipments are less than car load lots. The delays and expense incident  to handling small shipments of freight through the terminals of a  large city and carting from the unloading station to the warehouse or  other destination constitute a considerable item in the cost of  transportation.    Mr. Charles Whiting Baker, Consulting Editor of _Engineering  News-Record_, states:[1]         [1] Engineering News Record, July 10, 1919.         \"It costs today as much to haul a ton of farm produce ten miles       to a railway station as it does to haul it a thousand miles over       a heavy-traffic trunk-line railway. It often costs more today to       transport a ton of merchandise from its arrival in a long train       in the freight yard on the outskirts of a great city to its       deposit in the warehouse of a merchant four or five miles away       than it has cost to haul it over a thousand miles of railway       line.\"    Nevertheless it seems probable that new methods of operating the motor  truck transport, and possibly new types of trucks or trucks and  trailers will be developed so that freight traffic over many roads  will be of considerable tonnage and an established part of the  transportation system of the nation. In the article above referred to  are given the following data relative to the cost of hauling on  improved roads by motor truck and these cost estimates are based on  the best information available at this time. They should be considered  as approximate only, but serve to indicate the limitations of the  truck as a competitor of the steam railway.

In view of these facts it seems reasonable to suppose that motor  vehicles for use on the public highways are more likely to be employed  to supplement the rail transport than to compete with it. To the  actual cost of operation of motor trucks given in Table 2, there  should be added the proportionate cost of maintaining the highway for  the use of the truck, which is partly covered by the item \"License  Fee\" in the table. The license fee would necessarily be considerably  larger if it were to compensate adequately for the wear on the  highways over which"]]]
