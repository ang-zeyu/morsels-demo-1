A female obtained on June 26 carried eight embryos that measured 26, and  was in process of seasonal molt. Testes of a male shot on May 20  measured 35.      Order Rodentia      ~Eutamias minimus pallidus~ (J. A. Allen, 1874)    Least Chipmunk    _Specimens examined_ (31).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 15; NW 1/4 sec. 15,  R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 2; 2 mi. S, 3-1/4 mi. W Ludlow, 2; NW 1/4 sec. 32, R. 1  E, T. 20 N, 1; 9 mi. S, 7 mi. W Reva, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 9; NE  1/4 sec. 8, R. 8 E, T. 16 N, 1.    The least chipmunk is common in the buttes and associated badlands  where it most frequently inhabits rocky areas. Visher (1914:88) reported  _E. minimus_ from Harding County (\"abundant in badlands\"), but his paper  has been overlooked by most subsequent workers. Visher's mention of a  chipmunk from the mouth of the Moreau River in north-central South  Dakota, incidentally, would seem to be in error, as would the report by  Over and Churchill (1945:28) of _Eutamias_ inhabiting \"... thickets  along the Little Missouri River of Harding County.\"    Females evidently bear but one litter annually (in late May) in  northwestern South Dakota and young are weaned by the latter part of  June. Females taken on May 15 and 19 carried embryos (five measuring 30  and three measuring 28, respectively). A lactating female with five  placental scars was obtained on May 24, but eight adult females taken  after June 23 previously had weaned young. Juveniles were collected on  June 24 and 25. Testes of two adult males collected in mid-May measured  11 and 18, but males taken in summer had much smaller testes.    In late spring, most adult least chipmunks molt from the worn, drab-gray  pelage of winter to a brighter, more tawny summer pelage, but molt in a  few females, perhaps originally delayed by reproductive activity,  continues well into the summer months. Of seven specimens taken between  May 15 and 24, two (one male and one lactating female) were in an early  stage of molt, whereas the remainder were in winter pelage. Nine  specimens (four females and five males) taken in mid- and late June were  molting, but two females collected then were in winter pelage, and three  animals, two males and a female, had completed molt to summer pelage.  One adult female taken on August 5 had yet to complete molt to summer  pelage. In our material, the first indication of molt from winter to  summer pelage appears on the top of the head and the cheeks. Thereafter,  molt proceeds posteriorly over the shoulder region and more or less  evenly along the back and sides. In two specimens, small patches of molt  preceded the general molt line. Molt on the venter apparently begins  after molt on the dorsum approaches completion, but we could discern no  definite pattern; on four specimens, hair was being replaced on the  venter in scattered patches.    An August-taken young of the year engaged in post-juvenal molt had new  adult pelage in a vague hour-glass pattern in the dorsal trunk region as  well as on the cheeks and anterior part of the head. It was actively  molting on top of the head, between the ears, over the shoulders,  laterally behind the front feet, and along the sides, and had old pelage  on the rump. Ventrally, the new adult pelage was evident only along the  midline.    One adult male examined for ectoparasites harbored a tick, _Dermacentor  andersoni_ Stiles, and fleas, _Monopsyllus eumolpi_ Rothschild.      ~Spermophilus tridecemlineatus pallidus~ J. A. Allen, 1874    Thirteen-lined Ground Squirrel    _Specimens examined_ (22).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 5; 19 mi. N, 1 mi.  E Camp Crook, 2; 2 mi. S, 2 mi. W Ladner, 1; 6-1/2 mi. N, 2 mi. W Camp  Crook, 1; 1/2 mi. W Reva, 3; 4 mi. S, 1/2 mi. W Reva, 1; 6 mi. W Reva,  7; 15 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 1; 7 mi. S, 4-1/2 mi. E Harding, 1.    Ground squirrels are common in areas of short grass; we observed them  most frequently along roadways and fencerows in otherwise overgrazed  flats. Many of our specimens were shot or taken in break-back traps  baited with rolled oats in just such situations.    Young from the first litters of the year were above ground by late June  and represented the largest segment of the population at that time; for  example, only three of 17 individuals collected from June 20 to 27 were  adults. Adult females collected on June 20 and July 7 had enlarged  mammae but were no longer lactating.    Time of emergence from hibernation in northwestern South Dakota is  unknown, but many ground squirrels were active in the last week of  March, 1963. A male obtained on March 28 had testes that measured 27 and  was in full winter pelage, which is easily distinguished from the  shorter, darker pelage of summer.      ~Cynomys ludovicianus ludovicianus~ (Ord, 1815)    Black-tailed Prairie Dog    _Specimens examined_ (5).--Sec. 25, R. 3 E, T. 22 N, 2; 1-1/2 mi. W  Buffalo, 1; 1/2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3200 ft., 2.    The extensive flatlands of short grasses on relatively deep soils  provide ideal habitat for the black-tailed prairie dog in Harding  County. Visher (1914:89) mentioned extensive colonies along \"flats\" of  streams and reported one \"town\" west of the Little Missouri River that  covered several sections and another \"on the table of the West Short  Pine Hills.\" Recently, emphasis on control of numbers of prairie dogs in  the area has reduced many formerly extensive colonies to small, disjunct  units. According to Robert Kriege (personal communication, 1968), a  \"town\" of approximately 3000 acres, about five miles east of the Little  Missouri River (in R. 2 E, T. 21 N), is the largest remaining in the  county. Thirteen other colonies then known to him ranged in approximate  size from 25 to 300 acres.    White-colored prairie dogs apparently are not uncommon in some areas of  the county and local residents reported to us a number of instances of  sighting such individuals. One \"town\" located 7-1/2 mi. N and 12 mi. W  Ladner, in the northwestern corner of the county, contained at least six  families of white individuals, congregated together at the edge of the  colony, in the spring of 1968. White prairie dogs also were noted by one  of our field parties in 1963 in a \"town\" formerly located 7-1/2 mi. W  Buffalo.      ~Tamiasciurus hudsonicus dakotensis~ (J. A. Allen, 1894)    Red Squirrel    Visher (1914:88) reported that he obtained a red squirrel in the Long  Pine Hills, along the western border of Harding County, in July of 1910  and noted that the species had been reported to him as occurring also in  the West Short Pine Hills. Visher's record evidently has been overlooked  by subsequent cataloguers (see, for example, Hall and Kelson, 1959: map  257). Insofar as we can ascertain, _T. hudsonicus_ does not now occur on  any of the pine-clad buttes and ridges of the county, although the  species is present in relatively dense stands of ponderosa pine in the  Long Pine Hills of adjacent Carter County, Montana, at a place only a  few miles west of the South Dakota border. Probably some individuals  stray into the relatively small and sparsely-wooded areas of the Long  Pine Hills that extend eastward to the north of Camp Crook.    On the basis of color, specimens we have examined from the Long Pines  clearly are assignable to _T. h. dakotensis_ rather than to _T. h.  baileyi_, substantiating in part the statement of the distribution of  _dakotensis_ published by Miller and Kellogg (1955:263).      ~Thomomys talpoides bullatus~ Bailey, 1914    Northern Pocket Gopher    _Specimens examined_ (22).--NE 1/4 sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 23 N, 1; 7 mi. N,  2-1/2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3300 ft., 3; Camp Crook, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W  Reva, 10; 10 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 4; 2 mi. S, 5 mi. E Harding, 2; Crow  Buttes, 1 (USNM).    The northern pocket gopher probably occurs in most areas of northwestern  South Dakota where the soil is sufficiently deep for constructing  burrows, but we found it commonest in the lower grassy slopes of buttes  and in relatively sandy areas along some of the major streams.    A female obtained on June 20 contained two embryos that measured 3.  Testes of an adult male trapped on May 18 measured 19 and those of one  taken on July 6 measured 9. Juveniles were collected in both May and  June.    Bailey (1915:102) referred a specimen from Crow Buttes to _T. t.  bullatus_, but Swenk (1941:3), in the original description of _T. t.  pierreicolus_, suggested that this same specimen \"probably\" was  referable to the latter because he assumed it came from soils of the  Pierre series. However, Baker (1952:8) included the Crow Buttes in the  Hell Creek formation and, in any event, one of us (Jones) examined the  specimen in question and found it clearly referable to the subspecies  _bullatus_. Over and Churchill (1945:32) erroneously assigned pocket  gophers from northwestern South Dakota to two different subspecies  (_bullatus_ and _clusius_), referring at least one individual from  Harding County to _T. t. clusius_.    Fleas, _Dactylopsylla ignota_ (Baker), were found on one individual  examined. Molting adults were taken in each month from May through  August.      ~Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus~ Wied-Neuwied, 1839    Olive-backed Pocket Mouse    _Specimens examined_ (16).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 3; 4 mi. S, 7 mi. W  Ladner, 9; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 1; 14 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 2; 15 mi.  S, 4 mi. W Reva, 1.    This pocket mouse is not uncommon in areas of short grass and sage in  Harding County. None of five adult females taken late in June was  pregnant or lactating, but three had enlarged mammae indicative of  reproductive activity earlier in the spring, to which young of various  sizes in our series also attest. Active molt was evident on adults taken  on June 19, 26, and 28.    Our specimens are intergrades between _Perognathus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#3)"],[1,"ife, and hold them       for ransom. They will not be delivered up until their fine be       paid publicly, under full sanction of Congress. Moreover,       Congress and the people must guarantee, in addition to the full       payment, C. O. D., entire liberty to the abductors permanently       to withdraw from this country and live in future peace. Unless       Congress and the nation give their honor for the payment of the       ransom and our personal and impregnable liberty, we will not       deliver our prisoners. We impose a ransom of a million dollars       apiece for each week, for such time as this offer may remain       unaccepted. The time begins from date of capture. These       conditions are final. When the country, through its       representatives, accedes to this demand, the time and place of       delivery will be published in these columns. The loyalty and       honor of the nation are now on exhibition before the world._    This communication burst like dynamite upon the people. Did it not bear  an undeniable stamp of genuineness upon its face, not only through the  firmness of its tone, but by the audacity of the demand? Yet there was  an equal division of opinion. Some thought it was the raving of a crank  in search of notoriety, but others looked upon it as a veritable  communication from those who held the President and his wife in their  possession.    Two millions of dollars a week! A princely ransom worthy of a royal  couple and of the United States.    It was natural that the handwriting of this letter should be scrutinized  severely. Every ingenuity that detective art could devise for finding  the sender was employed. During the next few days New York underwent an  espionage worthy of the court of St Petersburg. But, to the utter  mortification of Inspector Byrnes and his myriads, of Pinkerton and his  myrmidons, they were bound to confess their utter failure. The  perpetrators of the incredible deed, like                                 \"An arm      Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\"    brandished the sword in the air and disappeared.    In the meantime the political nation was aroused. It experienced some  measure of relief to know, if it were true, that its chief was held for  paltry gold. In that case, he and his would be safe from the assassin's  sword or the vengeance of an alien party whose hatred he had incurred by  patriotic scorn in his inaugural address. An yet, the question was  raised whether some treasonable secret society had not secluded him,  hoping to increase its revenue at the expense of the United States  treasury. Many went so far as to pronounce it a Fenian plot to raise  money for Parnell in his final overthrow of English rule in Ireland.  Constituents wrote to their representatives in Washington, instructing  them to vote the ransom, without delay, from the surplus fund, which was  now one hundred and seventy-eight million dollars. Others instructed  them not to waste the public money, as the President and his spouse must  soon be found by competent detectives, and thus a \"creditable saving to  the treasury\" would be made. The Vice-President, who had succeeded to  full powers, sent a special message to Congress, requesting it to vote  the ransom, no matter how enormous. The strain on him was not worth the  people's money. So Congress met in secret session, and spent the balance  of the week fighting, temporizing, and receiving telegrams to the effect  that new clews were found.    On the twenty-second of June, exactly two weeks from the time of the  distinguished capture, the following epigrammatic communication was  printed by the New York _Herald_, in the same handwriting as the  previous one. The envelope bore a Chicago postmark:         \"_Congress has disregarded our generous offer: The ransom for       the President of the United States and for his wife is       therefore raised two million dollars._\"    This was all; cold and ominous. Like the first message it was unsigned.  The style was unrelenting and imperious. Citizens awoke to the sensation  that they who were now the nation's martyrs were in the hands of men who  would not shrink from enforcing their demand. It was now universally  believed that these were _bona fide_ bulletins sent by the unscrupulous  abductors themselves. This became the detectives' final theory, and they  massed their skill towards it.    The unsolved mystery brooded like dog-days over man, woman, and child. A  nameless fear, that of an unknown and irresistible enemy in their midst,  paralyzed the citizens. Prayers were offered in every church,  school-house, and home. The hostilities that but lately threatened the  country ceased. Civilization breathed nothing but sympathy for the  bereaved republic. Sovereigns redoubled their private guards and quaked  upon their thrones. And yet, in the face of fears, petitions, and  threats, Congress, in a spirit of disastrous conservatism that has  marked so many of its deliberations, allowed itself to be ruled by a  dissenting minority. Detective Byrnes, hoping to gain imperishable  credit and also the reward of five hundred thousand dollars which  Congress had been liberal enough to offer, counselled delay in a private  letter to the Speaker of the House. So it happened that this august body  would not ratify the overwhelming vote for immediate payment of ransom  which had just been passed by the Senate.    This filibustering brought the country into the third week of the  calamity. The following communication to the New York _Herald_,  postmarked Boston, written in the same hand as before, brought matters  to a crisis:         \"_The nation has evidently more love for their surplus than for       their President. The requisite ransom has reached six millions       of dollars in gold. The treasury is not yet exhausted, nor are       we. None can find us. Our defences are unapproachable. We laugh       at your attempts. The wife of your President, we are grieved to       say, is ill._\"    This proclamation aroused a new element, which had been smouldering, to  white heat. The women of the country rose _en masse_. They fired old  societies and organized new to collect ransom. The W. C. T. U. and W. H.  M. A. and A. S. A. and A. B. C. and X. Q. B. Z. thrilled to the  occasion. Infant Bands of Hope and Daughters of Endeavor invaded private  families with demands for penny subscriptions. Weeping women persuaded  dollars by the tens, hundreds and thousands from responsive men. They  renounced their bon-bons and new dresses, parties and dowries in their  patriotic fervor. The presidents of all the women's societies in the  land trooped to Washington. They cried shame at those who trifled for  the sake of the fiftieth part of the gold in the vaults with the noblest  life in the Union. These unselfish women stormed the capital, and  literally poured two millions of dollars, which they had collected in  less than three days, upon the floor of the House to rescue the first  lady of the land from who knew what? They forced their husbands, their  representatives, to do their bidding, and the final vote was passed amid  indescribable scenes.    The ransom was now ready for the President and their lady. It had to be  accompanied by the national promise to secure freedom to those who  delivered up the suffering couple. That was the third of July. Still the  impotence of the nation in this new crisis filled thoughtful men with  apprehension. Was it moral that cash instead of justice should be given  to these stupendous criminals? What a precedent for infamous success! Of  what avail courts of law and prisons if such consummate daring goes  unpunished? Is there a portion of our national machinery out of gear? If  so, which? Nevertheless the excitement was now beyond fever heat. It is  safe to say that the temperature of the people had risen ten degrees  when the news was flashed abroad that the \"President's money,\" as it was  called, had been unanimously voted by Congress. Tears streamed as  patriots met each other. Many developed a new species of insanity in  their suspense.    The country had now done its part toward the rescue of its chief  magistrate and of his perishing consort. Would the abductors be true to  their portion of the contract? Party strife had been forgotten in this  new anguish. All Fourth of July demonstrations had been postponed until  a loving people's thanksgiving for their President's safety could blend  with the time honored celebration of a nation's birth.    But suspense was not long delayed. Promptly the New York _Herald_  received a manifesto, this time the last, sent by the arch-conspirators  to Congress and the people. This envelope was boldly postmarked  Washington. This fact made those in the capital city almost afraid to  stir from their homes lest unawares they might meet the demon in their  midst who had dwarfed all principals in the records of crime up to the  present date. But this final proclamation read as follows:         TO CONGRESS AND ALL AMERICANS.         _We note your late and liberal response to our proposal. We       shall not be outdone in the honorable discharge of obligations.       At precisely eight (8) o'clock on the morning of July sixth       (6th) the payment of ransom and delivery of captives will take       place within one mile of Washington's homestead, Mt. Vernon.       The government vessel with ransom and proper officials on board       will remain in near sight of Mt. Vernon. At our signal (which       shall consist of four Japanese day rockets, each representing a       flaming sword) whether hurled from land or water, the officers       of the government will steam toward the place of delivery.       Guards will fall back immediately upon the discharge of       whistling bombs until the ransom and the ransomed meet. The       Presidential party will bear a flag, vertically striped black       and crimson. On its centre"]]]
