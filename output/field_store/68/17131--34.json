In _infucata_ the snout is bluntly rounded in  lateral profile and truncate in dorsal profile, whereas in _pseudopuma_  the snout is more acutely rounded in lateral profile and acuminate in  dorsal profile (Fig. 1). This external difference is correlated with the  nature of the underlying premaxillaries. In _infucata_ the  premaxillaries lie in a transverse plane and have short, nearly vertical  alary processes, whereas in _pseudopuma_ the premaxillaries lie at a  slight angle and have longer alary processes that are inclined  posteriorly.

Lateral views of the heads of _Hyla pseudopuma  pseudopuma_ (left, KU 64884) and _H. p. infucata_ (right, KU 101784). x  4.]    The only other frog in Central America having red webs and anterior and  posterior surfaces of the thighs is _Hyla loquax_, which has a broad  head, extensive axillary membrane, single median vocal sac, and  uniformly creamy yellow flanks; furthermore, _loquax_ lacks conical,  pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes and a large prepollex with  horny nuptial spinules. _Hyla rufitela_ has red webbing, but in no  other diagnostic feature resembles _infucata_, for _rufitela_ is green  above, white below, and has angular prevomerine dentigerous ridges.    _Remarks._--Most specimens of _Hyla pseudopuma infucata_ were found on  bushes and low trees at night. Three males and one clasping pair were on  the ground. The habitat is humid lower montane forest where the amount  of rainfall is high. Although no breeding was observed nor calls heard,  it is presumed that this subspecies breeds in shallow, temporary pools,  like those utilized by the nominate subspecies.    The two localities where _Hyla pseudopuma infucata_ is known are in the  maze of ridges north of Cerro Pando on the Panamanian-Costa Rican  border. The Rio Claro is a tributary of the Rio Changena, in turn a  tributary of the Rio Changuinola, which receives many streams and rivers  draining the northern slopes of the highlands in Bocas del Toro Province  before flowing into the Caribbean. We reached the Rio Claro and Rio  Changena by walking from Finca Santa Clara on the Pacific slopes, over  the continental divide, and down the north slope of Cerro Pando.    The subspecific name is derived from the Latin _infucatus_, meaning  painted, in allusion to the red colors on the limbs and webs.      Hyla pellita new species    Plate 18    _Holotype._--Adult male, KU 100970 from 33 kilometers north of San  Gabriel Mixtepec, Oaxaca, Mexico, elevation 1675 meters; obtained on  February 20, 1966, by William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb.    _Paratypes._--KU 100971-2 collected with the holotype and KU 100974-5  from 30 kilometers north of San Gabriel Mixtepec, Oaxaca, Mexico,  elevation 1530 meters; same date and collectors.    _Diagnosis._--A small yellowish tan _Hyla_ characterized by tympanum  concealed, anal opening not bordered below by large tubercles, brown  bands on shanks, and dark flecks on roof of mouth anteriorly.    _Description of holotype._--Adult male having snout-vent length of 27.3  mm.; tibia length 13.7 mm., 50.2 per cent of snout-vent length; foot  length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip  of longest toe) 11.7 mm., 42.9 per cent of snout-vent length; head  length 8.7 mm., 31.9 per cent of snout-vent length. Snout in lateral  profile truncate, rounded above, in dorsal profile rounded; canthus  angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips thin, flared. Snout  moderately long, distance from anterior corner of eye to nostril  slightly less than diameter of eye; nostrils slightly protuberant,  directed anterolaterally; internarial area barely depressed; distance  between nostrils 2.6 mm.; top of head flat; interorbital distance 3.2  mm., 34.4 per cent of width of head. Diameter of eye 2.7 mm.; thin  dermal fold extending from posterior corner of eye to point above  insertion of arm; tympanum absent, not visible through skin.    Axillary membrane absent; forearms moderately slender, having indistinct  tuberculate fold on ventrolateral edge, lacking distinct transverse fold  on wrist; fingers short; length of fingers from shortest to longest,  1-4-2-3, fourth nearly as long as second; discs small, about half again  as wide as digits; subarticular tubercules large, round, flattened,  distal ones on third and fourth fingers bifid; supernumerary tubercles  large, round, present only on proximal segments; prepollex barely  enlarged, lacking nuptial excrecence. Web lacking between first and  second fingers, extending from base of penultimate phalanx of second to  base of antepenultimate phalanx of third, from middle of antepenultimate  phalanx of third to distal end of antepenultimate of fourth finger.  Heels overlap by about one-fifth length of shank when hind limbs  adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to middle of eye, tarsal  fold present, extending full length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle  flat, ovoid, partly visible from above; outer metatarsal tubercle  absent; toes short; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4;  discs small, about two-thirds width of those on fingers; subarticular  tubercles small, round; supernumerary tubercles small, flattened,  irregularly arranged on proximal segments. Toes three-fourth webbed; web  extending from base of disc of first to middle of penultimate phalanx of  second, from base of disc of second to middle of penultimate phalanx of  third, from base of disc of third to base of penultimate phalanx of  fourth and to base of disc of fifth toe.    Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of dorsal surfaces of thighs,  bordered below by vertical dermal folds and few small tubercles; anal  sheath absent. Skin heavily granular on throat, chest, belly and ventral  surfaces of thighs, smooth elsewhere. Tongue cordiform, deeply notched  posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 3-4, situated on  short elevations between small round choanae; vocal slits absent.    Color (in preservative): pale tan above with dark brown mark in  occipital region and large irregular brown mark extending from scapular  region to sacral region; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs and  flanks lacking pigment; dorsal surfaces of arms, shanks, and feet tan  with brown transverse bars (two on each forearm, two on left shank, one  on right shank, and one on each foot); entire dorsal surfaces, except  hands and first four toes, peppered with black; venter creamy white;  roof of mouth between, and anterior to, choanae speckled with minute  black flecks.    Color (in life): yellowish tan above with reddish brown flecks (later  changed to pale brown with dull olive-green interorbital bar, blotch on  back, and flecks on dorsum); hands, feet, and anterior and posterior  surfaces of thighs dull yellow; belly white; creamy white stripes on  outer edge of forearm, foot, and above anus; iris pale silver-bronze.    _Variation._--Three adult males (including holotype) have snout-vent  lengths of 25.2-27.3 (mean 26.5) mm., and two females have 28.6 and 31.6  (mean 30.1) mm. One juvenile has a snout-vent length of 21.5 mm. No  significant variation occurs in the proportions. Males have 6-8, and  females have 8 and 9, prevomerine teeth. The tympanum is completely  concealed in all specimens.    All specimens have distinct transverse bars on the limbs; the number of  bars on the shank varies from one to four. Two individuals are dark  brown dorsally; in these the small black flecks either are not visible  or are absent; flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces of four  specimens that are tan or pale brown above with darker brown irregular  markings.    The coloration in life consisted of olive-green or olive-brown markings  on the body and olive-green or brown bars on the limbs. The dorsal  ground color was yellowish tan or pale brown in all individuals.    _Comparisons._--_Hyla pellita_ differs from all known Middle American  _Hyla_, except _mixe_, _mixomaculata_, _nubicola_, and _pinorum_, by  having a concealed tympanum. The first three of these differ from  _pellita_ in greater size and by having many bands on the hind limbs.  Superficially _H. pellita_ resembles _Hyla pinorum_, which likewise  has a tan dorsum with irregular markings and limbs with transverse bars.  _Hyla pinorum_ differs from _pellita_ by having a proportionately larger  head, no transverse bands on the thighs, and large tubercles below the  anus. Furthermore, in _pinorum_ "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33972"],[0,"Florida: An Ideal Cattle State (#3)"],[1,"didn't get any more at that time for the better grades than  they did for the others.    The limitation of the Hereford is that in the first cross between a  pure-bred and any of the primitive cattle ninety per cent will show  white faces or dominant characteristics, and just so in the use of  bulls, the animal may not have the intensification of blood that he  should have simply because he has a white face, and the bull peddler  has, as a proposition, bought something that he could sell at a profit,  rather than in following out any visions of cattle improvement.    I can not urge you too strongly to know absolutely the breeding strength  of anything you buy, and that means in a general way that you must buy  known cattle. I realize, too, that there is a great shortage of bulls,  and probably the only way that you can get what you want, because it  goes without saying that you can not afford to pay the price for  registered bulls in all your work, is to work in some way through a  central community of interests, go to Texas and buy the bull calf crop  of some herd of cattle that will show fifteen-sixteenths or better  breeding. I urge this freely, because you must go below the line and  none of our own cattle are available. I believe that if you bring these  calves over here, say in November at weaning time, at the age of about  six months, and give them some good winter help, that they will  acclimate quickly, and will give you very fair returns in the yearling  period, although, of course, you can not expect from them a real  usefulness until the two-year-old period.    While the Hereford has been the redeemer of the ranges, practically  every ranch man in Texas has felt that an undercurrent of Shorthorn is  of the greatest advantage. We have used it persistently in our own work,  and feel that it has given a most appreciable contribution to the weight  and general quality of our cattle.    In the last few years the Brahma cattle have come into prominence, and  every investigation that I have made shows that they will undoubtedly  prove a great factor in the evolution of Florida cattle. They seem to be  immune to most of the pests and do not require as much in the way of  acclimatization. They show a wonderful growth in yearlings and they mark  their progeny with size and distinct characteristics in a most decided  way. The packers seem to like them; they kill out a large per cent of  beef, and while I have never had any experience with them, all my  observation has been in their favor, and I urge you to go as far as you  can in utilizing them in Florida.    I am, however, convinced that you are going to need both the Shorthorn  and the Hereford to combine with them. I am also convinced that both the  Shorthorns and the Black cattle are going to prove very valuable  adjuncts in your eventual work in the State, particularly as applied to  small areas where the cattle are not asked to live as much upon their  own resources. The experience, however, in Texas has been that the calf  crop is not as great from either of these breeds as from the Herefords.    For your information, on the S. M. S. Ranch we have averaged better than  eighty percent calf crop for the last ten years. I think that perhaps  you will find the Brahma cattle even more prolific than the Herefords. I  think, too, that in every possible way you should encourage the breeders  of full-blood cattle in all of these breeds, and that you give them  every encouragement in purchasing their progeny.    The introduction of good bulls is a comparatively simple matter, because  they can be purchased, but a great cow herd can only be produced by  accumulation, probably by a culling of at least ten per cent of all  females every year during the process of up-grading. The yearling  heifers should not be bred. We always cull them when about eighteen  months old, cutting them ten per cent. Culling should be done both from  an individual standpoint and from the standpoint of \"Get.\" The culling  process is the most important element in beef evolution.    The process of culling will not be extravagant, because looking to the  next few years it would seem that canner cattle will probably be as  strong as any other branch of the industry, and these culls are usually  not only splendid canners, but furnish quite an element of cutters,  which means cattle producing very fair meat for regular consumption. I  believe, too, that on any range of appreciable dimensions you will find  it an economy to produce your own bulls, and in starting any good sized  property I urge that you keep that in mind. Get your cows just as good  as you can get them; of course pure-breds will be better, and then use  only the best registered sires in that herd.    I think advisable, too, in your branding, to put the year brand on all  heifers, as it will be of material assistance to you in the matter of  knowing the intensification of blood during the early process. It will  not be so important later on when the cattle are all very high grade.    The use of the scrub bull is an economic crime; therefore no matter what  you use in the way of a sire you are pointed upward, but I feel that it  will be a distinct economy to try to get seven-eighths, or at least  fifteen-sixteenths sires.    Another thing which offers a great economy in your country is the  possibility of dropping calves an average of about two months earlier  than they do in Texas. We do not like to have a calf come before the 1st  of April. I believe that you can drop yours during January and February  without any trouble, judging from the average condition of your cattle  in a winter said to be from early October, the most severe you have ever  had. Dropping a calf at that time will have him old enough to eat your  young grasses when they begin to come. He will have a two months' pull  over the Texas calf; will have at least two months longer to combine  nursing and grazing to deliver him the first of November.    As a summary of your breeding problem, I regard it as the simplest thing  you have to deal with. There seems to be a sure result by comparison  with other countries; there can be little argument as to its economic  value, and it is simply a matter of disposition and making the proper  investment in inclosures, in bulls and water development to accomplish a  good business result.    I only want to add this fragment as to breeding. Since dictating this  section I chanced to meet at lunch today Mr. Will Goodwin, for thirty  years one of the officers and managers of the Breeders' Gazette and one  of the best authorities in the world on cattle. His winter home is near  Ocala, Florida, and he has seen enough of your ranges to convince him of  their great utility in beef production. He agrees with me that the  evolution of your cattle is simply a matter of disposition. I find,  however, that he has no use for the Brahma bull, although he joins me in  the belief that you can not do anything to hurt the present breeding  process, and he rather grudgingly admits that the Brahma bull may have a  place in scale. I reviewed with him at some length what has preceded and  asked him what he thought about my comparison with the Texas primitive  cattle as to having more scale. He thinks I am right in that connection,  but says that he believes the Florida cow is more shapely; that she has  a better hindquarter than the old Texan cattle, and is, in a sense, a  miniature Shorthorn, and that he believes that a cross between a  Shorthorn and a primitive Florida cow will give you the best basis.    I called his attention to the fact that in range experience neither the  Blacks nor the Shorthorns seem to be able to make their own living as  well as the Herefords and do not get the calf crop, and he was quite  free to say that it had a little force. On the other hand, he confirms  fully my belief that where a better class of protection can be offered  than the vast ranges, the Shorthorn cross and the cross with the Blacks  either on primitive cows or their cross will have splendid results.    He also called my attention to the prominence that Blacks are getting in  Florida.    There is, therefore, a very wide range of possibilities in your breeding  problem, all of it pointed upward, and there may be something in your  experience here which will show that the Shorthorn and Black have a  greater mission on the open range than they had in Texas. There  certainly can be no question about the value of the blood.    And here I might add that the Government is not asking any one to  increase beef production from a patriotic standpoint, but rather that it  offers a splendid investment. And perhaps I might add that when our boys  who have gone into the army come back again they will practically all  be trained athletes; men seasoned to the out-of-doors and loving it; men  who have obtained an earnestness in life and a new vision as to  usefulness, and when you stop to reflect that we have been sending the  flower of the world to the front, when it comes back to us we will not  only have the attributes I have described, but the flower of the world  to apply them, and I look for an increased interest in all of the  out-of-door lines of business such as America has never seen before.    I thought I knew something of my own country and something of the  possibilities of land available for cattle production, but seeing your  ranges has been a revelation. They are off the track of the tourist.  There is sparse settlement, and they are known to very few. In fact,  they might be, in a sense, called a hidden country, but the whole of  America is interested in everything that offers a good agricultural or  stock-raising possibility, and when our boys come back, not only the  boys of the South, but the boys of America are going to investigate your  properties.    I promised to come back to water development. Practically every question  that I have asked"]]]
