CHAPTER 1    Geography of Borneo    Borneo is one of the largest islands of the world. Its area is  roughly 290,000 square miles, or about five times that of England  and Wales. Its greatest length from north-east to south-west is 830  miles, and its greatest breadth is about 600 miles. It is crossed  by the equator a little below its centre, so that about two-thirds  of its area lie in the northern and one-third lies in the southern  hemisphere. Although surrounded on all sides by islands of volcanic  origin, Borneo differs from them in presenting but small traces of  volcanic activity, and in consisting of ancient masses of igneous  rock and of sedimentary strata.    The highest mountain is Kinabalu, an isolated mass of granite in the  extreme north, nearly 14,000 feet in height. With this exception the  principal mountains are grouped in several massive chains, which  rise here and there to peaks about 10,000 feet above the sea. The  principal of these chains, the Tibang-Iran range, runs south-westward  through the midst of the northern half of the island and is prolonged  south of the equator by the Schwaner chain. This median south-westerly  trending range forms the backbone of the island. A second much-broken  chain runs across the island from east to west about 1[degree]  north of the equator. Besides these two principal mountain chains  which determine the main features of the river-system, there are  several isolated peaks of considerable height, and a minor ridge of  hills runs from the centre towards the south-cast corner. With the  exception of the northern extremity, which geographically as well  as politically stands apart from the rest of the island, the whole  of Borneo may be described as divided by the two principal mountain  chains into four large watersheds. Of these, the north-western basin,  the territory of Sarawak, is drained by the Rejang and Baram, as well  as by numerous smaller rivers. Of the other three, which constitute  Dutch Borneo, the north-eastern is drained by the Batang Kayan or  Balungan river; the south-eastern by the Kotei and Banjermasin rivers;  and the south-western by the Kapuas, the largest of all the rivers,  whose course from the centre of the island to its south-west corner  is estimated at 700 miles. Although the point of intersection of the  two principal mountain chains lies almost exactly midway between the  northern and southern and the eastern and western extremities of the  island, the greater width of the southern half of the island gives a  longer course to the rivers of that part, in spite of the fact that  all the six principal rivers mentioned above have their sources not  far from this central point. The principal rivers thus radiate from  a common centre, the Batang Kayan flowing east-north-east, the Kotei  south-east by east, the Banjermasin south, the Kapuas a little south  of west, the Rejang west, and the Baram north-west. This radiation of  the rivers from a common centre is a fact of great importance for the  understanding of the ethnography of the island, since the rivers are  the great highways which movements of the population chiefly follow.    In almost all parts of the island, the land adjoining the coast is  a low-lying swampy belt consisting of the alluvium brought down by  the many rivers from the central highlands. This belt of alluvium  extends inland in many parts for fifty miles or more, and is especially  extensive in the south and south-east of the island.    Between the swampy coast belt and the mountains intervenes a zone of  very irregular hill country, of which the average height above the  sea-level is about one thousand feet, with occasional peaks rising  to five or six thousand feet or more.    There seems good reason to believe that at a comparatively recent  date Borneo was continuous with the mainland of Asia, forming its  south-eastern extremity. Together with Sumatra and Java it stands  upon a submarine bank, which is nowhere more than one hundred fathoms  below the surface, but which plunges down to a much greater depth  along a line a little east of Borneo (Wallace's line). The abundance  of volcanic activity in the archipelago marks it as a part of the  earth's crust liable to changes of elevation, and the accumulation of  volcanic matter would tend to make it an area of subsidence; while  the north-east monsoon, which blows with considerable violence down  the China Sea for about four months of each year, may have hastened  the separation of Borneo from the mainland. That this separation was  effected in a very recent geological period is shown by the presence in  Borneo of many species of Asiatic mammals both large and small, notably  the rhinoceros (R. BORNIENSIS, closely allied to R. SUMATRANUS);  the elephant (E. INDICUS, which, however, may have been imported by  man); the wild cattle (BOS SONDIACUS, which occurs also in Sumatra);  several species of deer and pig (some of which are found in Sumatra  and the mainland); several species of the cat tribe, of which the  tiger-cat (FELIS NEBULOSA) is the largest; the civet-cat (VIVERRA)  and its congeners HEMIGALE, PARADOXURUS, and ARCTOGALE; the small  black bear (URSUS MALAYANUS); the clawless otter (LUTRA CINEREA); the  bear-cat (ARCTICTIS BINTURONG); the scaly ant-eater (MANIS JAVANICUS);  the lemurs (TARSIUS SPECTRUM and NYCTICEBUS TARDIGRADUS); the flying  lemur (GALEOPITHECUS VOLANS); the porcupine (HYSTRIX CRASSISPINIS);  numerous bats, squirrels, rats and mice; the big shrew (GYMNURA);  several species of monkeys, and two of the anthropoid apes. The last  are of peculiar significance, since they are incapable of crossing  even narrow channels of water, and must be regarded as products of  a very late stage of biological evolution. Of these two anthropoid  species, the gibbon (HYLOBATES MULLERI) is closely allied to species  found in the mainland and in Sumatra, while the MAIAS or orang-utan  (SIMIA SALYRUS) is found also in Sumatra and, though not now surviving  on the continent, must be regarded as related to anthropoids whose  fossil remains have been discovered there.[2]    The zoological evidence thus indicates a recent separation of Borneo  and Sumatra from the continent, and a still more recent separation  between the two islands.    The climate of the whole island is warm and moist and very equable. The  rainfall is copious at all times of the year, but is rather heavier  during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon in the months from  October to February, and least during the months of April and May. At  Kuching, during the last thirty years, the average yearly rainfall  has been 160 inches, the maximum 225, and the minimum 102 inches;  the maximum monthly fall recorded was 69 inches, and the minimum  .66, and the greatest rainfall recorded  in one day was 15 inches. The temperature hardly, if ever, reaches  100[degree] F.; it ranges normally between 70[degree] and 90[degree]  F.; the highest reading of one year (1906) at Kuching was 94[degree],  the lowest 69[degree].

Fordable at  no point within many miles the river was full of running water at all  seasons of the year, and in flood times formed in its confined bed a  turbulent rushing torrent with dangerous falls in several places. Of  the Anegundi chiefs we know little, but they were probably feudatories  of the Hoysala Ballalas. Firishtah declares that they had existed as  a ruling family for seven hundred years prior to the year 1350 A.D.[7]    The chronicle of Nuniz gives a definite account of how the sovereigns  of Vijayanagar first began to acquire the power which afterwards became  so extensive. This account may or may not be accurate in all details,  but it at least tallies fairly with the epigraphical and other records  of the time. According to him, Muhammad Taghlaq of Delhi, having  reduced Gujarat, marched southwards through the Dakhan Balaghat, or  high lands above the western ghats, and a little previous to the year  1336[8] seized the town and fortress of Anegundi. Its chief was slain,  with all the members of his family. After a futile attempt to govern  this territory by means of a deputy, Muhammad raised to the dignity of  chief of the state its late minister, a man whom Nuniz calls \"Deorao,\"  for \"Deva Raya.\" or Harihara Deva I. The new chief founded the city  of Vijayanagar on the south bank of the river opposite Anegundi and  made his residence there, with the aid of the great religious teacher  Madhava, wisely holding that to place the river between him and the  ever-marauding Moslems was to establish himself and his people in  a condition of greater security than before. He was succeeded by  \"one called Bucarao\" (Bukka), who reigned thirty-seven years, and  the next king was the latter's son, \"Pureoyre Deo\" (Harihara Deva II.).    We know from other sources that part at least of this story is  correct. Harihara I. and Bukka were the first two kings and were  brothers, while the third king, Harihara II., was certainly the son  of Bukka.    The success of the early kings was phenomenal. Ibn Batuta, who was  in India from 1333 to 1342, states that even in his day a Muhammadan  chief on the western coast was subject to Harihara I., whom he calls  \"Haraib\" or \"Harib,\" from \"Hariyappa\" another form of the king's  name; while a hundred years later Abdur Razzak, envoy from Persia,  tells us that the king of Vijayanagar was then lord of all Southern  India, from sea to sea and from the Dakhan to Cape Comorin --  \"from the frontier of Serendib (Ceylon) to the extremities of the  country of Kalbergah ... His troops amount in number to eleven lak,\"  I.E. 1,100,000. Even so early as 1378 A.D., according to Firishtah,[9]  the Raya of Vijayanagar was \"in power, wealth, and extent of country\"  greatly the superior of the Bahmani king of the Dakhan.    The old southern states appear (we have little history to guide  us) to have in general submitted peaceably to the rule of the new  monarchy. They were perhaps glad to submit if only the dreaded  foreigners could be kept out of the country. And thus by leaps  and bounds the petty state grew to be a kingdom, and the kingdom  expanded till it became an empire. Civil war and rebellion amongst  the Muhammadans helped Harihara and Bukka in their enterprise. Sick  of the tyranny and excesses of Muhammad Taghlaq, the Dakhan revolted  in 1347, and the independent kingdom of the Bahmanis was for a time  firmly established.    The chronicle of Nuniz opens with the following sentence: --    \"In the year twelve hundred and thirty these parts of India were  ruled by a greater monarch than had ever reigned. This was the king  of Dili,[10] who by force of arms and soldiers made war on Cambaya for  many years, taking and destroying in that period the land of Guzarate  which belongs to Cambaya,[11] and in the end he became its lord.\"    After this the king of Delhi advanced against Vijayanagar by way of  the Balaghat.    This date is a century too early, as already pointed out. The sovereign  referred to is stated in the following note (entered by Nuniz at  the end of Chapter xx., which closes the historical portion of his  narrative) to have been called \"Togao Mamede.\"    \"This king of Delhi they say was a Moor, who was called Togao  Mamede. He is held among the Hindus as a saint. They relate that once  while he was offering prayer to God, there came to him four arms with  four hands; and that every time he prayed roses fell to him from out  of heaven. He was a great conqueror, he held a large part of this  earth under his dominion, he subdued ... (blank in original) kings,  and slew them, and flayed them, and brought their skins with him; so  that besides his own name, he received the nickname ... which means  'lord of ... skins of kings;' he was chief of many people.    \"There is a story telling how he fell into a passion on account of  (BEING GIVEN?) eighteen letters (OF THE ALPHABET TO HIS NAME?), when  according to his own reckoning he was entitled to twenty-four.[12]  There are tales of him which do indeed seem most marvellous of the  things that he did; as, for instance, how he made ready an army because  one day in the morning, while standing dressing at a window which was  closed, a ray of the sun came into his eyes, and he cried out that he  would not rest until he had killed or vanquished whomsoever had dared  to enter his apartments while he was dressing. All his nobles could  not dissuade him from his purpose, even though they told him it was  the sun that had done it, a thing without which they could not live,  that it was a celestial thing and was located in the sky, and that he  could never do any harm to it. With all this he made his forces ready,  saying that he must go in search of his enemy, and as he was going  along with large forces raised in the country through which he began  his march so much dust arose that it obscured the sun. When he lost  sight of it he made fresh inquiries as to what the thing was, and  the captains told him that there was now no reason for him to wait,  and that he might return home since he had put to flight him whom he  had come to seek. Content with this, the king returned by the road  that he had taken in his search for the sun, saying that since his  enemy had fled he was satisfied.    \"Other extravagances are told of him which make him out a great lord,  as, for instance, that being in the Charamaodel country he was told  that certain leagues distant in the sea there was a very great island,  and its land was gold, and the stones of its houses and those which  were produced in the ground were rubies and diamonds: in which  island there was a pagoda, whither came the angels from heaven to  play music and dance. Being covetous of being the lord of this land,  he determined to go there, but not in ships because he had not enough  for so many people, so he began to cart a great quantity of stones  and earth and to throw it into the sea in order to fill it up, so  that he might reach the island; and putting this in hand with great  labour he did so much that he crossed over to the island of Ceyllao,  which is twelve or fifteen leagues off[13], This causeway that he  made was, it is said, in course of time eaten away by the sea, and  its remains now cause the shoals of Chillao. Melliquiniby,[14] his  captain-general, seeing how much labour was being spent in a thing so  impossible, made ready two ships in a port of Charamaodell which he  loaded with much gold and precious stones, and forged some despatches  as of an embassy sent in the name of the king of the island, in which  he professed his obedience and sent presents; and after this the king  did not proceed any further with his causeway.    \"In memory of this work he made a very large pagoda, which is still  there; it is a great place of pilgrimage.    \"There are two thousand of these and similar stories with which I  hope at some time to trouble your honour; and with other better ones,  if God gives me life. I kiss your honour's hand.\"[15]    To conclusively establish the fact that this account can only refer  to Muhammad Taghlaq of Delhi, who reigned from 1325 to 1351, it is  necessary that we should look into the known character of that monarch  and the events of his reign.    Nuniz states that his \"Togao Mamede\" conquered Gujarat, was at war  with Bengal, and had trouble with the Turkomans on the borders of  Sheik Ismail, I.E. Persia.[16] To take these in reverse order. Early  in the reign of Muhammad Taghlaq vast hordes of Moghuls invaded  the Panjab and advanced almost unopposed to Delhi, where the king  bought them off by payment of immense sums of money. Next as to  Bengal. Prior to his reign that province had been subdued, had given  trouble, and had again been reduced. In his reign it was crushed  under the iron hand of a viceroy from Delhi, Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur  \"Bura,\" who before long attempted to render himself independent. He  styled himself Bahadur Shah, and issued his own coinage. In 1327  (A.H. 728) the legends on his coins acknowledge the overlordship of  Delhi, but two years later they describe him as independent king of  Bengal.[17] In 1333 Muhammad issued his own coinage for Bengal and  proceeded against the rebel. He defeated him, captured him, flayed  him alive, and causing his skin to be stuffed with straw ordered it  to be paraded through the provinces of the empire as a warning to  ambitious governors. With reference to Gujarat, Nuniz has been led  into a slight error. Muhammad Taghlaq certainly did go there, but  only in 1347. What he did do was to conquer the Dakhan. Firishtah  mentions among his conquests Dvarasamudra, Malabar, Anegundi (under  the name \"Kampila,\" for a reason that will presently be explained),  Warangal, &c, and these places \"were as effectually incorporated  with his empire as the villages in the "]]]
