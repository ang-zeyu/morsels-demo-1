When young they do not look much like their  parents; they are rounder and their legs are more prominent. The female  cyclops (the male is comparatively rare) is the most common creature in  Cochituate water, and as it is constantly eating, it helps to purify the  water, and, in its turn, is eaten by the fishes.    In swimming it contracts its four horns and its fringed feet with a  quick movement that throws it forward through the water with a leap.    Its one eye is of a brilliant red, and is a beautiful object under the  microscope. The shell also is sometimes beautifully colored, and is  often transparent, so that the internal organs are plainly visible  through it.      [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    Another of the family of _Cyclopidae_ is the _Canthocamptus minutus_  (_fig. 3_), which you see is longer and more tapering in its form than  the _Cyclops Quadricornis_. It is also very common and very active.    _Chydorus Sphoericus_ (_fig. 4_) is a very pretty round form  interesting to study when transparent.    All these and some others with rather hard names are in that division of  the _Crustacea_ called _Entomostraca_, meaning shelled creatures whose  shells are cut and do not cover them all round. On this principle, an  oyster on the half-shell might be called an _Entomostracan_.    Now to catch these lively fellows, you must take a dipping tube and be  patient, and when you have got one in the tube, carefully drop it on the  bottom of the \"live-box\" (_fig. 5_), and put on the cover. Examine it  first with the lowest power you have. By careful management of the cover  you can catch it between the top and bottom without breaking the shell,  and in this prison you can study it at leisure.      V.--COCHITUATE WATER.    You have read or been told that if you look at a drop of water through a  microscope you will find it full of animalculae, and showmen will  sometimes exhibit water containing _entomostraca_ hopping about, and  will try to persuade you that all water looks in the same way.      [Illustration: ROTIFER VULGARIS.]    But this is a common mistake, as you will soon find out for yourselves.  Water such as is commonly used for drinking purposes, whether it comes  from a well, spring, river, or pond, contains but little animal or  vegetable life in proportion to its quantity; you may place drop after  drop under the microscope without finding anything visible, and you can  only tell what is in it by filtering a great deal of it. Water standing  in ditches or pools for a long time, becomes full of growth of various  kinds, and is then so discolored and slimy that no one would think of  drinking it.      [Illustration: CARAPACE OF ANURAE STIPITATA.]    Let us return to the little bottle which you filled with Cochituate  filterings last month. Take a little from the bottom with your  dipping-tube; put it in the live box and examine it with a half-inch  objective. You will see many forms that are strange to you, and we will  suppose that the first is that of one of the rotifers. These little  creatures are called by this name because of two Latin words meaning  wheel-carriers, for on their heads they have an arrangement which looks  like a wheel, sometimes in rapid motion.      [Illustration: FLOSCULARIA ORNATA.]    The most common kind is called _Rotifer vulgaris_ (_fig. 1_), and is a  very interesting and elastic being. Sometimes he is gloomy and draws  himself in so that he looks like a ball; then he will stretch out full  length, and opening his wheel, shoot through the water with great speed.  Again he will attach his tail to some fixed object, and by the aid of  his wheel draw a rapid current of water through his mouth; it is thus  that you can best observe him, and by and by you will discover that the  apparent wheel is only a result of the rapid sweeping movement of the  long hairs or cilia which fringe the opening in the top of the head.  Through this opening the water passes, the rotifer gathers his food from  the current, and the food passes into the mastax, where it is ground by  the masticating apparatus, which is easily seen in motion.      [Illustration: DINOBRYON TORTULARIA.]    There are several different rotifers found in Cochituate water; among  them the most common is the _Anurae Stipitata_. (_Fig. 2._) It is like a  turtle, with a shell, or carapace, beautifully ornamented. You will see  plenty of these empty shells, and sometimes you will find one inhabited,  when you will see that the creature has a bright red eye, and several  bundles of cilia, in front of the projecting spires.    One of the families of the rotifers is called _Floscularia_, because it  resembles a flower; it is attached at the base to small plants, or algae,  and occupies a sheath so transparent that it is hardly visible. One  species is occasionally found in the Cochituate, the _Floscularia  ornata_. (_Fig. 3._) It is a beautiful object, with its elongated  radiating cilia, which remain quiet, and do not vibrate. The specimen  figured has three eggs attached to its stem.    You will find other rotifers in the Cochituate, some formed like vases,  others with long spires, but all graceful and beautiful. The _Dinobryon  Tortularia_ is sometimes very common in this water.    In October, 1881, when the taste of the water was very bad, the  _Dinobryon_ was very abundant, though we do not know that it had  anything to do with the bad taste. You will see by the figure, that it  is like a tree, with an individual of the family at the end of every  branch. Each one has its own organs of existence, although attached to  its brothers by its stem. Each has a bright red eye, and a long slender  whip, called a _flagellum_, with which it lashes the water, and when all  the _flagellae_ are in motion, the whole tree swims about. The  individuals are very small indeed, and it will take your best objective  to show the _flagellum_.      [Illustration: VORTICELLA NEBULIFERA.]    Another tree-like group is that of the _Vorticella_, of which you will  sometimes find in the Cochituate, the species _Vorticella nebulifera_.  Each animal is at the top of a stem, and this stem has the peculiar  property of being able to coil up and draw its head down close to the  bottom. This appears to be a defensive movement, for whenever a big ugly  creature comes by, down go the whole family so quickly that your eye  cannot follow the movement. Sometimes they will all bob down when you  tap the stage of the microscope so as to jar them. At a certain period  of its life the animal suddenly leaves its stem, and goes swimming about  with great speed.      VI.--INTERESTING OBJECTS.      [Illustration: STEPHANODISCUS NIAGARAE.]    The most beautiful of the small _algae_ or water plants are the  _Diatomaceae_ and the _Desmidiaceae_, sometimes called for brevity diatoms  and desmids. They are remarkable for the geometrical character of their  forms, consisting of circles, triangles and polygons of infinite  variety. They are very small, and cannot be satisfactorily seen with an  objective of less power than a four tenths. The diatoms are found  everywhere in both fresh and salt water, but the desmids live only in  fresh water. One of the most common diatoms in Cochituate water is the  _Stephanodiscus Niagarae_. (_Fig. 1._) It is in shape like a pill box,  and its sides, which would be called its top and bottom if it were a  pill box, are beautifully ornamented with dots in radiating lines with a  ring of spines near the edge. This circle of spines or thorns explains  its name, _Stephanodiscus_, from the proto-martyr, Saint Stephen. The  name _Niagarae_ is from Niagara River, where it was found. Like all  diatoms, it contains when alive a yellowish brown matter with small  globules of oil, which is called _endochrome_. The box or shell, called  _pustule_, is of silex or quartz, and is therefore almost  indestructible; and when the diatom dies, sinks to the bottom of the  water. In this way beds of shells of diatoms are sometimes formed of  considerable thickness.      [Illustration: ASTERIONELLA BLEAKLEYII.]      [Illustration: TABELLARIA FENESTRATA.]    Under the city of Richmond, Va., there is such a deposit, varying from  ten to twenty feet in depth, and extending for many miles. Some of the  diatoms, especially those shaped like a boat, called _Navicula_, have a  peculiar motion which at one time led observers to think them animals.  No one knows how this motion is produced, and if you can find this  out, you will make a very important discovery. The most common diatom in  Cochituate water is _Asterionella Bleakleyii_. It resembles a star with  rays, or the hub and spokes of a wheel. (_Fig. 2._) This diatom is often  found in abundance in the water supplies of cities. It never forms a  complete circle, but grows into spirals or whorls which easily break up.      [Illustration: SPONGILLA FLUVIATILIS.]      [Illustration: DESMIDIUM SWARTZII. FRONT AND SIDE VIEW.]    Another diatom common in Cochituate is _Tabellaria Fenestrata_, which  grows in ribbon-like forms. (_Fig. 3._) The desmids resemble the diatoms  in the geometrical character of their forms, but they have no shell of  silex, and are therefore easily destroyed. They are readily  distinguished at sight by the beautiful green color of the contained  matter. In many of them there is a curious circulation of small  particles, especially in the ends of those of a crescent or new-moon  shape. This circulation can only be seen with a high power. Desmids are  easily found in ponds and ditches; and there are several species in  Cochituate. Among them is _Desmidium Swartzii_ (_fig. 4_), and  _Closterium moniliferum_. (_Fig. 5._) Their beauty depends so much on  color that they do not appear to advantage in the figures. You will find  in examining the filterings of Cochituate water, many objects which have  not been described in these papers, and among them many fragments of"]]]
