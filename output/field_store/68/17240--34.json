This animal is found in every latitude between the Equator and the  Arctic circle, ranging over barren mountains and through fertile  valleys, feeding upon almost every species of edible forage--the  cultivated grasses, clovers, cereals, and roots--browsing on aromatic  and bitter herbs alike, cropping the leaves and barks from stunted  forest shrubs and the pungent, resinous evergreens. In some parts of  Norway and Sweden, when other resources fail, he subsists on fish or  flesh during the long, rigorous winter, and, if reduced to necessity,  even devours his own wool.    In size, he is diminutive or massive; he has many horns, or but two  large or small spiral horns, or is polled or hornless. His tail may be  broad, or long, or a mere button, discoverable only by the touch. His  covering is long and coarse, or short and hairy, or soft and furry, or  fine and spiral. His color varies from white or black to every shade of  brown, dun, buff, blue, and gray. This wide diversity results from long  domestication under almost every conceivable variety of condition.    Among the antediluvians, sheep were used for sacrificial offerings, and  their fleeces, in all probability, furnished them with clothing. Since  the deluge their flesh has been a favorite food among many nations. Many  of the rude, wandering tribes of the East employ them as beasts of  burden. The uncivilized--and, to some extent, the refined--inhabitants  of Europe use their milk, not only as a beverage, but for making into  cheese, butter, and curds--an appropriation of it which is also noticed  by Job, Isaiah, and other Old Testament writers, as well as most of the  Greek and Roman authors. The ewe's milk scarcely differs in appearance  from that of the cow, though it is generally thicker, and yields a pale,  yellowish butter, which is always soft and soon becomes rancid. In dairy  regions the animal is likewise frequently employed at the tread-mill or  horizontal wheel, to pump water, churn milk, or perform other light  domestic work.    The calling of the shepherd has, from time immemorial, been conspicuous,  and not wanting in dignity and importance. Abel was a keeper of sheep;  as were Abraham and his descendants, as well as most of the ancient  patriarchs. Job possessed fourteen thousand sheep. Rachel, the favored  mother of the Jewish race, \"came with her father's sheep, for she kept  them.\" The seven daughters of the priest of Midian \"came and drew water  for their father's flocks.\" Moses, the statesman and lawgiver, \"learned  in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" busied himself in tending \"the  flocks of Jethro, his father-in-law.\" David, too, that sweet singer of  Israel and its destined monarch--the Jewish hero, poet, and divine--was  a keeper of sheep. To shepherds, \"abiding in the field, keeping watch  over their flocks by night,\" came the glad tidings of a Saviour's birth.  The Hebrew term for sheep signifies, in its etymology, fruitfulness,  abundance, plenty--indicative of the blessings which they were destined  to confer upon the human family. In the Holy Scriptures, this animal is  the chosen symbol of purity and the gentler virtues, the victim of  propitiatory sacrifices, and the type of redemption to fallen man.    Among profane writers, Homer and Hesiod, Virgil and Theocritus,  introduce them in their pastoral themes; while their heroes and  demi-gods--Hercules and Ulysses, Eneas and Numa--carefully perpetuate  them in their domains.    In modern times, they have engaged the attention of the most enlightened  nations, whose prosperity has been intimately linked with them, wherever  wool and its manufactures have been regarded as essential staples. Spain  and Portugal, during the two centuries in which they figured as the  most enterprising European countries, excelled in the production and  manufacture of wool. Flanders, for a time, took precedence of England in  the perfection of the arts and the enjoyments of life; and the latter  country then sent what little wool she raised to the former to be  manufactured. This being soon found highly impolitic, large bounties  were offered by England for the importation of artists and machinery;  and by a systematic and thorough course of legislation, which looked to  the utmost protection and increase of wool and woollens, she gradually  carried their production beyond any thing the world had ever seen.    Of the original breed of this invaluable animal, nothing certain is  known; four varieties having been deemed by naturalists entitled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#3)"],[1,"generally possesses the  marvellous instinct teaching her to put her babies comfortably afloat  on the sea of life. The disregard of a pet dog's feelings at which I  have hinted may take the form of sending a tiny bitch out to the stable  to pup under the care of a coachman or groom, and this may or may not be  cruel according to whether she has any affection for the man or any  knowledge of her temporary quarters; personally, I should consider it an  unkind thing to do under any circumstances.    The beginning of the toy bitch's trouble is apparent to her owner almost  as soon as to herself. She pants, and runs about excitedly, scratching  here and there, making wildly impossible and absurd nests for her  puppies in all kinds of unsuitable places. This may last for days, but  is generally only done for a few hours before the puppies arrive, which,  by the way, will be nine weeks after mating. Some bitches shriek in a  very distressing way before they pup, and, as a rule, food is refused,  and the little mother that is to be is often sick. No anxiety, however,  need be felt. As soon as she really means business she will quiet down  and settle in the place prepared for her, which by choice should be a  big, deep arm-chair, with a white blanket--any old thing will do that is  clean--folded in the seat of it, and over this an old cotton sheet,  likewise folded, and so secured that the bitch cannot scrabble it up in  the foolish endeavour to improve human bed-making which always possesses  dogs, and, if indulged, lands them in desperate discomfort on the top of  a kind of volcano of rags!    In nine cases out of ten a bitch chooses to pup in the night, and the  hours often seem very long, while she may lie and sleep in evident  uneasiness, getting up every now and then to make her bed, and panting  as if exhausted. It is quite safe to leave her in this condition for  twelve hours, but if by that time she seems to be getting weaker and no  puppies have come, the vet's services should be requisitioned. Probably  she will not eat, but she may be offered a little cold milk. On no  account give her anything hot, externally or internally, and do not be  tempted to do anything whatever to her; the only interference which is  ever excusable is the application of a very little sweet oil or vaseline  externally, which she will lick off, and which does no harm and no good,  in my experience.    If help is called for at all, it must be the skilled aid of a surgeon;  any other is worse than useless.    Illustration: FRENCH TOY BULLDOG. _\"La Reine des Roses,\" owned by Mrs.  Townsend Green._    The puppies are born singly, and if a bitch has a large litter they  generally come in twos and threes, with a very short interval between  the items of each brace or trio, and a long rest between the batches.  The first services the mother has to render her babies are to free them  from the bag of membranes in which they are born, and to bite the cord  which joins each puppy to the afterbirth--a fleshy substance which comes  away with or shortly after it. All animals intensely dislike being  watched while they perform these operations; but every bitch who is  anything at all of a mother will manage them perfectly. Next comes the  licking of the puppies, which have been enclosed each in its membranous  bag full of liquid (the _liquor amniae_), and are consequently dripping  wet. Here is the crucial test: a good mother licks her babies until they  are warm and dry, then feeds them, and snuggles down with them into a  contented heap of intense happiness. A bad mother, on the contrary,  leaves her poor infants to dry as best they can, a process which  invariably ends in their developing a kind of infantile skin complaint,  which appears like a scab of cheesy substance attached to the roots of  the hair. It grows away with the hair by degrees, and gets well without  treatment, but is ugly and disfiguring for the time being, and a sad  evidence of incompetence on the part of the mother.    When the family have settled down, and the puppies are dry and  comfortable, it is time to give them a little attention. Have a saucer  full of nice, warm milk-gruel, made with patent groats as daintily as  for an invalid, and let the mother drink it, which she will be sure to  do with gratitude; she may have more at intervals during the first day.  Then roll away the soiled folds of sheet from under her and the litter,  which can now be done without disturbing them, and leave them cosily  ensconced on the clean, warm blanket, which has been all the time  underneath.    A little later the mother may be put out into the garden for a few  minutes, not more than two or three; but she must not be allowed to get  chilled. After the first day she should go out for a little walk morning  and afternoon, the time of her absence to be gradually lengthened as the  puppies grow older.    Until they begin to crawl, valuable toy puppies are much safer and  better upstairs in a big chair as described, or in a flat basket with a  folded blanket at the bottom set upon the chair, than they can possibly  be in any stable or in the kitchen premises, for, no matter how warm,  such places are draughty too. There is absolutely nothing about a  litter of little toys, if healthy, to be in the least offensive  anywhere, and a good mother will keep them in the very pink of  perfection for nearly a month under such circumstances.    Where a poor or weakly mother is concerned, and where the puppies are  restless, squall, and seem damp and comfortless, it is another matter.  By constant attention as to the changing of the bed, partial  hand-feeding from a small old silver spoon with cream and hot water, and  Plasmon or Lactol, half and half (better than milk, though _warm_ milk  will do), and a great deal of patience, the mother may be helped out and  the puppies saved; but where they are not valuable it is better to  destroy all but one or two; and where they are so, a good foster-mother  offers them by far the best chance of life and health. There are people  who make it their business to supply fosters, and one of these should be  applied to as soon as possible; taking pains to ensure, by careful  examination on arrival, that the stranger has no skin disease and is  free from objectionable insects.    Small toy bitches sometimes have but little milk at first, but by giving  warm food only for the first few days, and plenty of milk to drink, it  generally comes all right, and so long as the pups seem fairly content,  all is well; the flow is sure to increase. Both before and after pupping  there is generally a little diarrhoea, which is of no consequence; but  if it goes on beyond the second day after pupping, get the bitch on to  her usual diet, with a little cold milk to drink, and stop all sloppy  foods. Oatmeal, as gruel or otherwise, should never be given after the  second day. A discharge, of mucus mixed with blood, is usual after  pupping, and may continue for several weeks in gradually lessening  amount.          CHAPTER IV    ON REARING PUPS      An indispensable adjunct in the rearing of valuable toy puppies, which,  as a general rule, do far better in the house than in any stable or  out-of-door premises, is one of Spratt's or Boulton and Paul's little  houses and runs. As personal and vicarious experiences are all that any  writer can adduce to support theory, I may be allowed to describe the  procedure which has been found successful with my own puppies--born,  bred, and reared in house and garden as they are.    Directly they leave the basket of their infancy (in which, _par  parenthese_, I must say, I think them more delightful, helpless little  soft morsels, than even when they begin to run about, show intelligence,  and need feeding) they are introduced to one of these useful abodes,  comprising a sleeping house, provided with a cosy blanket, freely  washable and often changed, and a little wired-in run about 4 ft. by 2  ft. The bigger this the better, of course; and if it has a floor, as  some have, pierced with small holes and draining into a removable tray  to be kept full of earth, or sawdust, it will be well. Mine is a humbler  affair, floorless, and stands on a piece of oilcloth, covered with a  large sheet of brown paper, which can be daily renewed; yet it answers  its purpose very well. In this, with outings two or three times a day,  for variety, the puppies live until they are seven weeks old; the  mother, loose about the house, visiting them at her inclination and  sleeping with them. At between three and four weeks old they must be  taught to lap, which is easy enough with some pups and difficult with  others. Warm, boiled milk should be the only addition to what the mother  gives them until they are over a month old: it is a mistake to hurry  puppies on to patent foods, bread and milk, and the like. Do not let  them have a saucer and upset it, tumbling into it and getting  themselves in a mess, to dry all sour and disagreeable, but hold their  little heads one by one as they lap, for they _will_ nod into the saucer  and send the milk flying.    As soon as the puppies are strong on their legs, they need more exercise  and fun than the run can allow them, and now is the time to take them  off the carpets, which they will never respect in after life if they  have been allowed to treat them evilly as elderly babies. It is not a  bad plan to let them live in the kitchen from this time forth, various  things being provisional. One is, that the presiding genius will see to  their little meals under your supervision; that is, you feed them four  times a day, and she or he undertakes to see that no one else does so.  Another, that the kitchen opens into the, or a, garden, and that the  puppies can run there in the sunshine, in warm weather, and so  insensibly learn manners; yet another, that it is a warm, draughtless  place, with a nice corner for their"]]]
