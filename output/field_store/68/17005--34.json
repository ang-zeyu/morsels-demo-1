Hister required, then, of the Lygians a promise not  to cross the boundary; to this they not only agreed, but gave hostages,  among whom were the wife and daughter of their leader. It is known to  thee that barbarians take their wives and children to war with them. My  Lygia is the daughter of that leader.\"    \"Whence dost thou know all this?\"    \"Aulus Plautius told it himself. The Lygians did not cross the boundary,  indeed; but barbarians come and go like a tempest. So did the Lygians  vanish with their wild-ox horns on their heads. They killed Vannius's  Suevi and Yazygi; but their own king fell. They disappeared with their  booty then, and the hostages remained in Hister's hands. The mother died  soon after, and Hister, not knowing what to do with the daughter, sent  her to Pomponius, the governor of all Germany. He, at the close of the  war with the Catti, returned to Rome, where Claudius, as is known to  thee, permitted him to have a triumph. The maiden on that occasion  walked after the car of the conqueror; but, at the end of the  solemnity,--since hostages cannot be considered captives, and since  Pomponius did not know what to do with her definitely--he gave her to  his sister Pomponia Graecina, the wife of Plautius. In that house where  all--beginning with the masters and ending with the poultry in the  hen-house--are virtuous, that maiden grew up as virtuous, alas! as  Graecina herself, and so beautiful that even Poppaea, if near her, would  seem like an autumn fig near an apple of the Hesperides.\"    \"And what?\"    \"And I repeat to thee that from the moment when I saw how the  sun-rays at that fountain passed through her body, I fell in love to  distraction.\"    \"She is as transparent as a lamprey eel, then, or a youthful sardine?\"    \"Jest not, Petronius; but if the freedom with which I speak of my desire  misleads thee, know this,--that bright garments frequently cover deep  wounds. I must tell thee, too, that, while returning from Asia, I slept  one night in the temple of Mopsus to have a prophetic dream. Well,  Mopsus appeared in a dream to me, and declared that, through love, a  great change in my life would take place.\"    \"Pliny declares, as I hear, that he does not believe in the gods, but he  believes in dreams; and perhaps he is right. My jests do not prevent me  from thinking at times that in truth there is only one deity, eternal,  creative, all-powerful, Venus Genetrix. She brings souls together; she  unites bodies and things. Eros called the world out of chaos. Whether he  did well is another question; but, since he did so, we should recognize  his might, though we are free not to bless it.\"    \"Alas! Petronius, it is easier to find philosophy in the world than wise  counsel.\"    \"Tell me, what is thy wish specially?\"    \"I wish to have Lygia. I wish that these arms of mine, which now embrace  only air, might embrace Lygia and press her to my bosom. I wish to  breathe with her breath. Were she a slave, I would give Aulus for her  one hundred maidens with feet whitened with lime as a sign that they  were exhibited on sale for the first time. I wish to have her in my  house till my head is as white as the top of Soracte in winter.\"    \"She is not a slave, but she belongs to the 'family' of Plautius; and  since she is a deserted maiden, she may be considered an 'alumna.'  Plautius might yield her to thee if he wished.\"    \"Then it seems that thou knowest not Pomponia Graecina. Both have become  as much attached to her as if she were their own daughter.\"    \"Pomponia I know,--a real cypress. If she were not the wife of Aulus,  she might be engaged as a mourner. Since the death of Julius she has  not thrown aside dark robes; and in general she looks as if, while still  alive, she were walking on the asphodel meadow. She is, moreover, a  'one-man woman'; hence, among our ladies of four and five divorces, she  is straightway a phoenix. But! hast thou heard that in Upper Egypt the  phoenix has just been hatched out, as 'tis said?--an event which happens  not oftener than once in five centuries.\"    \"Petronius! Petronius! Let us talk of the phoenix some other time.\"    \"What shall I tell thee, my Marcus? I know Aulus Plautius, who, though  he blames my mode of life, has for me a certain weakness, and even  respects me, perhaps, more than others, for he knows that I have never  been an informer like Domitius Afer, Tigellinus, and a whole rabble  of Ahenobarbus's intimates [Nero's name was originally L. Domitius  Ahenobarbus]. Without pretending to be a stoic, I have been offended  more than once at acts of Nero, which Seneca and Burrus looked at  through their fingers. If it is thy thought that I might do something  for thee with Aulus, I am at thy command.\"    \"I judge that thou hast the power. Thou hast influence over him; and,  besides, thy mind possesses inexhaustible resources. If thou wert to  survey the position and speak with Plautius.\"    \"Thou hast too great an idea of my influence and wit; but if that is the  only question, I will talk with Plautius as soon as they return to the  city.\"    \"They returned two days since.\"    \"In that case let us go to the triclinium, where a meal is now ready,  and when we have refreshed ourselves, let us give command to bear us to  Plautius.\"    \"Thou hast ever been kind to me,\" answered Vinicius, with vivacity; \"but  now I shall give command to rear thy statue among my lares,--just such a  beauty as this one,--and I will place offerings before it.\"    Then he turned toward the statues which ornamented one entire wall  of the perfumed chamber, and pointing to the one which represented  Petronius as Hermes with a staff in his hand, he added,--\"By the light  of Helios! if the 'godlike' Alexander resembled thee, I do not wonder at  Helen.\"    And in that exclamation there was as much sincerity as flattery; for  Petronius, though older and less athletic, was more beautiful than even  Vinicius. The women of Rome admired not only his pliant mind and his  taste, which gained for him the title Arbiter elegantiae, but also his  body. This admiration was evident even on the faces of those maidens  from Kos who were arranging the folds of his toga; and one of whom,  whose name was Eunice, loving him in secret, looked him in the eyes with  submission and rapture. But he did not even notice this; and, smiling  at Vinicius, he quoted in answer an expression of Seneca about  woman,--Animal impudens, etc. And then, placing an arm on the shoulders  of his nephew, he conducted him to the triclinium.    In the unctorium the two Grecian maidens, the Phrygians, and the two  Ethiopians began to put away the vessels with perfumes. But at that  moment, and beyond the curtain of the frigidarium, appeared the heads  of the balneatores, and a low \"Psst!\" was heard. At that call one of  the Grecians, the Phrygians, and the Ethiopians sprang up quickly, and  vanished in a twinkle behind the curtain. In the baths began a moment of  license which the inspector did not prevent, for he took frequent part  in such frolics himself. Petronius suspected that they took place; but,  as a prudent man, and one who did not like to punish, he looked at them  through his fingers.    In the unctorium only Eunice remained. She listened for a short time  to the voices and laughter which retreated in the direction of the  laconicum. At last she took the stool inlaid with amber and ivory,  on which Petronius had been sitting a short time before, and put it  carefully at his statue. The unctorium was full of sunlight and the hues  which came from the many-colored marbles with which the wall was faced.  Eunice stood on the stool, and, finding herself at the level of the  statue, cast her arms suddenly around its neck; then, throwing back her  golden hair, and pressing her rosy body to the white marble, she pressed  her lips with ecstasy to the cold lips of Petronius.          Chapter II      After a refreshment, which was called the morning meal and to which the  two friends sat down at an hour when common mortals were already long  past their midday prandium, Petronius proposed a light doze. According  to him, it was too early for visits yet. \"There are, it is true,\"  said he, \"people who begin to visit their acquaintances about sunrise,  thinking that custom an old Roman one, but I look on this as barbarous.  The afternoon hours are most proper,--not earlier, however, than that  one when the sun passes to the side of Jove's temple on the Capitol and  begins to look slantwise on the Forum. In autumn it is still hot, and  people are glad to sleep after eating. At the same time it is pleasant  to hear the noise of the fountain in the atrium, and, after the  obligatory thousand steps, to doze in the red light which filters in  through the purple half-drawn velarium.\"    Vinicius recognized the justice of these words; and the two men began  to walk, speaking in a careless manner of what was to be heard on  the Palatine and in the city, and philosophizing a little upon life.  Petronius withdrew then to the cubiculum, but did not sleep long. In  half an hour he came out, and, having given command to bring verbena, he  inhaled the perfume and rubbed his hands and temples with it.    \"Thou wilt not believe,\" said he, \"how it enlivens and freshens one. Now  I am ready.\"    The litter was waiting long since; hence they took their places, and  Petronius gave command to bear them to the Vicus Patricius, to the  house of Aulus. Petronius's \"insula\" lay on the southern slope of the  Palatine, near the so-called Carinae; their nearest way, therefore, was  below the Forum; but since Petronius wished to step in on the way to see  the jeweller Idomeneus, he gave the direction to carry them along the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#3)"],[1,"vast bodies that we have been able to measure  and to weigh. The telescope has enabled us also to penetrate deep into  outer space; we have learnt of other systems besides that of our own sun  and its dependents, many of them far more complex; clusters and clouds  of stars have been revealed to us, and mysterious nebulae, which suggest  by their forms that they are systems of suns in the making. More lately  the invention of the spectroscope has informed us of the very elements  which go to the composition of these numberless stars, and we can  distinguish those which are in a similar condition to our sun from those  differing from him. And photography has recorded for us objects too  faint for mere sight to detect, even when aided by the most powerful  telescope; too detailed and intricate for the most skilful hand to  depict.    Galileo's friend and contemporary, Kepler, laid the foundations of  another department of modern astronomy at about the same time. He  studied the apparent movements of the planets until they yielded him  their secret so far that he was able to express them in three simple  laws, laws which, two generations later, Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated  to be the outcome of one grand and simple law of universal range, the  law of gravitation. Upon this law the marvellous mathematical conquests  of astronomy have been based.    All these wonderful results have been attained by the free exercise of  men's mental abilities, and it cannot be imagined that God would have  intervened to hamper their growth in intellectual power by revealing to  men facts and methods which it was within their own ability to discover  for themselves. Men's mental powers have developed by their exercise;  they would have been stunted had men been led to look to revelation  rather than to diligent effort for the satisfaction of their curiosity.  We therefore do not find any reference in the Bible to that which  modern astronomy has taught us. Yet it may be noted that some  expressions, appropriate at any time, have become much more appropriate,  much more forcible, in the light of our present-day knowledge.    The age of astronomy which preceded the Modern, and may be called the  Classical age, was almost as sharply defined in its beginning as its  successor. It lasted about two thousand years, and began with the  investigations into the movements of the planets made by some of the  early Greek mathematicians. Classical, like Modern astronomy, had its  two sides,--the instrumental and the mathematical. On the instrumental  side was the invention of graduated instruments for the determination of  the positions of the heavenly bodies; on the mathematical, the  development of geometry and trigonometry for the interpretation of those  positions when thus determined. Amongst the great names of this period  are those of Eudoxus of Knidus (B.C. 408-355), and Hipparchus of  Bithynia, who lived rather more than two centuries later. Under its  first leaders astronomy in the Classical age began to advance rapidly,  but it soon experienced a deadly blight. Men were not content to observe  the heavenly bodies for what they were; they endeavoured to make  them the sources of divination. The great school of Alexandria (founded  about 300 B.C.), the headquarters of astronomy, became invaded by  the spirit of astrology, the bastard science which has always  tried--parasite-like--to suck its life from astronomy. Thus from the  days of Claudius Ptolemy to the end of the Middle Ages the growth of  astronomy was arrested, and it bore but little fruit.    It will be noticed that the Classical age did not commence until about  the time of the completion of the last books of the Old Testament; so we  do not find any reference in Holy Scripture to the astronomical  achievements of that period, amongst which the first attempts to explain  the apparent motions of sun, moon, stars, and planets were the most  considerable.    We have a complete history of astronomy in the Modern and Classical  periods, but there was an earlier astronomy, not inconsiderable in  amount, of which no history is preserved. For when Eudoxus commenced his  labours, the length of the year had already been determined, the  equinoxes and solstices had been recognized, the ecliptic, the celestial  equator, and the poles of both great circles were known, and the five  principal planets were familiar objects. This Early astronomy must have  had its history, its stages of development, but we can only with  difficulty trace them out. It cannot have sprung into existence  full-grown any more than the other sciences; it must have started from  zero, and men must have slowly fought their way from one observation to  another, with gradually widening conceptions, before they could bring it  even to that stage of development in which it was when the observers of  the Museum of Alexandria began their work.    The books of the Old Testament were written at different times during  the progress of this Early age of astronomy. We should therefore  naturally expect to find the astronomical allusions written from the  standpoint of such scientific knowledge as had then been acquired. We  cannot for a moment expect that any supernatural revelation of purely  material facts would be imparted to the writers of sacred books, two or  three thousand years before the progress of science had brought those  facts to light, and we ought not to be surprised if expressions are  occasionally used which we should not ourselves use to-day, if we were  writing about the phenomena of nature from a technical point of view. It  must further be borne in mind that the astronomical references are not  numerous, that they occur mostly in poetic imagery, and that Holy  Scripture was not intended to give an account of the scientific  achievements, if any, of the Hebrews of old. Its purpose was wholly  different: it was religious, not scientific; it was meant to give  spiritual, not intellectual enlightenment.    An exceedingly valuable and interesting work has recently been brought  out by the most eminent of living Italian astronomers, Prof. G. V.  Schiaparelli, on this subject of \"Astronomy in the Old Testament,\" to  which work I should like here to acknowledge my indebtedness. Yet I feel  that the avowed object of his book,[7:1]--to \"discover what ideas the  ancient Jewish sages held regarding the structure of the universe, what  observations they made of the stars, and how far they made use of them  for the measurement and division of time\"--is open to this  criticism,--that sufficient material for carrying it out is not within  our reach. If we were to accept implicitly the argument from the silence  of Scripture, we should conclude that the Hebrews--though their calendar  was essentially a lunar one, based upon the actual observation of the  new moon--had never noticed that the moon changed its apparent form as  the month wore on, for there is no mention in the Bible of the lunar  phases.    The references to the heavenly bodies in Scripture are not numerous, and  deal with them either as time-measurers or as subjects for devout  allusion, poetic simile, or symbolic use. But there is one  characteristic of all these references to the phenomena of Nature, that  may not be ignored. None of the ancients ever approached the great  Hebrew writers in spiritual elevation; none equalled them in poetic  sublimity; and few, if any, surpassed them in keenness of observation,  or in quick sympathy with every work of the Creator.    These characteristics imply a natural fitness of the Hebrews for  successful scientific work, and we should have a right to believe that  under propitious circumstances they would have shown a pre-eminence in  the field of physical research as striking as is the superiority of  their religious conceptions over those of the surrounding nations. We  cannot, of course, conceive of the average Jew as an Isaiah, any more  than we can conceive of the average Englishman as a Shakespeare, yet the  one man, like the other, is an index of the advancement and capacity of  his race; nor could Isaiah's writings have been preserved, more than  those of Shakespeare, without a true appreciation of them on the part of  many of his countrymen.    But the necessary conditions for any great scientific development were  lacking to Israel. A small nation, planted between powerful and  aggressive empires, their history was for the most part the record of a  struggle for bare existence; and after three or four centuries of the  unequal conflict, first the one and then the other of the two sister  kingdoms was overwhelmed. There was but little opportunity during these  years of storm and stress for men to indulge in any curious searchings  into the secrets of nature.    Once only was there a long interval of prosperity and peace; viz. from  the time that David had consolidated the kingdom to the time when it  suffered disruption under his grandson, Rehoboam; and it is significant  that tradition has ascribed to Solomon and to his times just such a  scientific activity as the ability and temperament of the Hebrew race  would lead us to expect it to display when the conditions should be  favourable for it.    Thus, in the fourth chapter of the First Book of Kings, not only are the  attainments of Solomon himself described, but other men, contemporaries  either of his father David or himself, are referred to, as distinguished  in the same direction, though to a less degree.         \"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,       and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the       seashore. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the       children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For       he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman,       and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in       all nations round about. And he spake"]]]
