Upon the Discovery is one who signed himself \"John Radclyffe, comenly  called,\" and who is named in the London Company's list as \"Captain John  Sicklemore, alias Ratcliffe.\" He will have a short and stormy Virginian  life, and in two years be done to death by Indians. John Smith quarreled  with him also. \"A poor counterfeited Imposture!\" said Smith. Gabriel  Archer is a lawyer, and first secretary or recorder of the colony.  Short, too, is his life. His name lives in Archer's Hope on the James  River in Virginia. John Smith will have none of him! George Kendall's  life is more nearly spun than Ratcliffe's or Archer's. He will be shot  for treason and rebellion. Robert Hunt is the chaplain. Besides those  whom the time dubbed \"gentlemen,\" there are upon the three ships  English sailors, English laborers, six carpenters, two bricklayers,  a blacksmith, a tailor, a barber, a drummer, other craftsmen, and  nondescripts. Up and down and to and fro they pass in their narrow  quarters, microscopic upon the bosom of the ocean.    John Smith looms large among them. John Smith has a mantle of marvelous  adventure. It seems that he began to make it when he was a boy, and for  many years worked upon it steadily until it was stiff as cloth of gold  and voluminous as a puffed-out summer cloud. Some think that much of it  was such stuff as dreams are made of. Probably some breadths were the  fabric of vision. Still it seems certain that he did have some kind  of an extraordinary coat or mantle. The adventures which he relates of  himself are those of a paladin. Born in 1579 or 1580, he was at this  time still a young man. But already he had fought in France and in  the Netherlands, and in Transylvania against the Turks. He had known  sea-fights and shipwrecks and had journeyed, with adventures galore, in  Italy. Before Regal, in Transylvania, he had challenged three Turks in  succession, unhorsed them, and cut off their heads, for which doughty  deed Sigismund, a Prince of Transylvania, had given him a coat of arms  showing three Turks' heads in a shield. Later he had been taken in  battle and sold into slavery, whereupon a Turkish lady, his master's  sister, had looked upon him with favor. But at last he slew the Turk  and escaped, and after wandering many days in misery came into Russia.  \"Here, too, I found, as I have always done when in misfortune, kindly  help from a woman.\" He wandered on into Germany and thence into France  and Spain. Hearing of wars in Barbary, he crossed from Gibraltar. Here  he met the captain of a French man-of-war. One day while he was with  this man there arose a great storm which drove the ship out to sea. They  went before the wind to the Canaries, and there put themselves to rights  and began to chase Spanish barks. Presently they had a great fight with  two Spanish men-of-war, in which the French ship and Smith came off  victors. Returning to Morocco, Smith bade the French captain good-bye  and took ship for England, and so reached home in 1604. Here he sought  the company of like-minded men, and so came upon those who had been to  the New World--\"and all their talk was of its wonders.\" So Smith  joined the Virginia undertaking, and so we find him headed toward new  adventures in the western world.    On sailed the three ships--little ships--sailing-ships with a long way  to go.    \"The twelfth day of February at night we saw a blazing starre and  presently a storme.... The three and twentieth day [of March] we fell  with the Iland of Mattanenio in the West Indies. The foure and twentieth  day we anchored at Dominico, within fourteene degrees of the Line,  a very faire Iland, full of sweet and good smells, inhabited by  many Savage Indians.... The six and twentieth day we had sight of  Marigalanta, and the next day wee sailed with a slacke sail alongst the  Ile of Guadalupa.... We sailed by many Ilands, as Mounserot and an Iland  called Saint Christopher, both uninhabited; about two a clocke in the  afternoone wee anchored at the Ile of Mevis. There the Captaine landed  all his men.... We incamped ourselves on this Ile six days.... The tenth  day [April] we set saile and disimboged out of the West Indies and bare  our course Northerly.... The six and twentieth day of Aprill, about  foure a clocke in the morning, wee descried the Land of Virginia.\"*         * Percy's \"Discourse in Purchas, His Pilgrims,\" vol. IV, p.       1684. Also given in Brown's \"Genesis of the United States\",       vol. I, p. 152.    During the long months of this voyage, cramped in the three ships, these  men, most of them young and of the hot-blooded, physically adventurous  sort, had time to develop strong likings and dislikings. The hundred and  twenty split into opposed camps. The several groups nursed all manner of  jealousies. Accusations flew between like shuttlecocks. The sealed box  that they carried proved a manner of Eve's apple. All knew that seven on  board were councilors and rulers, with one of the number President, but  they knew not which were the seven. Smith says that this uncertainty  wrought much mischief, each man of note suggesting to himself, \"I shall  be President--or, at least, Councilor!\" The ships became cursed with  a pest of factions. A prime quarrel arose between John Smith and  Edward-Maria Wingfield, two whose temperaments seem to have been poles  apart. There arose a \"scandalous report, that Smith meant to reach  Virginia only to usurp the Government, murder the Council, and proclaim  himself King.\" The bickering deepened into forthright quarrel, with at  last the expected explosion. Smith was arrested, was put in irons, and  first saw Virginia as a prisoner.    On the twenty-sixth day of April, 1607, the Susan Constant, the  Goodspeed, and the Discovery entered Chesapeake Bay. They came in  between two capes, and one they named Cape Henry after the then Prince  of Wales, and the other Cape Charles for that brother of short-lived  Henry who was to become Charles the First. By Cape Henry they anchored,  and numbers from the ships went ashore. \"But,\" says George Percy's  Discourse, \"we could find nothing worth the speaking of, but faire  meadows and goodly tall Trees, with such Fresh-waters running through  the woods as I was almost ravished at the first sight thereof. At night,  when wee were going aboard, there came the Savages creeping upon all  foure from the Hills like Beares, with their Bowes in their mouths,  charged us very desperately in the faces, hurt Captaine Gabriel  Archer in both his hands, and a sayler in two places of the body very  dangerous. After they had spent their Arrowes and felt the sharpnesse  of our shot, they retired into the Woods with a great noise, and so left  us.\"    That very night, by the ships' lanterns, Newport, Gosnold, and Ratcliffe  opened the sealed box. The names of the councilors were found to be  Christopher Newport, Bartholomew Gosnold, John Ratcliffe, Edward-Maria  Wingfield, John Martin, John Smith, and George Kendall, with Gabriel  Archer for recorder. From its own number, at the first convenient time,  this Council was to choose its President. All this was now declared and  published to all the company upon the ships. John Smith was given his  freedom but was not yet allowed place in the Council. So closed an  exciting day. In the morning they pressed in parties yet further into  the land, but met no Indians--only came to a place where these savages  had been roasting oysters. The next day saw further exploring. \"We  marched some three or foure miles further into the Woods where we saw  great smoakes of fire. Wee marched to those smoakes and found that the  Savages had beene there burning downe the grasse....We passed through  excellent ground full of Flowers of divers kinds and colours, anal as  goodly trees as I have seene, as cedar, cipresse and other kindes; going  a little further we came into a little plat of ground full of fine and  beautifull strawberries, foure times bigger and better than ours in  England. All this march we could neither see Savage nor Towne.\"*         * Percy's \"Discourse.\"    The ships now stood into those waters which we call Hampton Roads.  Finding a good channel and taking heart therefrom, they named a horn  of land Point Comfort. Now we call it Old Point Comfort. Presently they  began to go up a great river which they christened the James. To English  eyes it was a river hugely wide. They went slowly, with pauses and  waitings and adventures. They consulted their paper of instructions;  they scanned the shore for good places for their fort, for their  town. It was May, and all the rich banks were in bloom. It seemed a  sweet-scented world of promise. They saw Indians, but had with these  no untoward encounters. Upon the twelfth of May they came to a point  of land which they named Archer's Hope. Landing here, they saw \"many  squirels, conies, Black Birds with crimson wings, and divers other  Fowles and Birds of divers and sundrie colours of crimson, watchet,  Yellow, Greene, Murry, and of divers other hewes naturally without any  art using... store of Turkie nests and many Egges.\" They liked this  place, but for shoal water the ships could not come near to land. So on  they went, eight miles up the river.    Here, upon the north side, thirty-odd miles from the mouth, they came to  a certain peninsula, an island at high water. Two or three miles long,  less than a mile and a half in breadth, at its widest place composed of  marsh and woodland, it ran into the river, into six fathom water, where  the ships might be moored to the trees. It was this convenient deep  water that determined matters. Here came to anchor the Susan Constant,  the Goodspeed, and the Discovery. Here the colonists went ashore.

The service was increased to three a week in  summer and one in winter.    The main post road ran from northern New England to Savannah, closely  hugging the seacoast for the greater part of the way. Some of the  milestones set by Franklin to enable the postmasters to compute the  postage, which was fixed according to distance, are still standing.  Crossroads connected some of the larger communities away from the  seacoast with the main road, but when Franklin died, after serving also  as Postmaster General of the United States, there were only seventy-five  post offices in the entire country.    Franklin took a hand in the final struggle between France and England  in America. On the eve of the conflict, in 1754, commissioners from the  several colonies were ordered to convene at Albany for a conference with  the Six Nations of the Iroquois, and Franklin was one of the deputies  from Pennsylvania. On his way to Albany he \"projected and drew a plan  for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might  be necessary for defense and other important general purposes.\" This  statesmanlike \"Albany Plan of Union,\" however, came to nothing. \"Its  fate was singular,\" says Franklin; \"the assemblies did not adopt it, as  they all thought there was too much PREROGATIVE in it and in England it  was judg'd to have too much of the DEMOCRATIC.\"    How to raise funds for defense was always a grave problem in the  colonies, for the assemblies controlled the purse-strings and released  them with a grudging hand. In face of the French menace, this was  Governor Shirley's problem in Massachusetts, Governor Dinwiddie's in  Virginia, and Franklin's in the Quaker and proprietary province of  Pennsylvania. Franklin opposed Shirley's suggestion of a general tax to  be levied on the colonies by Parliament, on the ground of no taxation  without representation, but used all his arts to bring the Quaker  Assembly to vote money for defense, and succeeded. When General Braddock  arrived in Virginia Franklin was sent by the Assembly to confer with him  in the hope of allaying any prejudice against Quakers that the general  might have conceived. If that blustering and dull-witted soldier had any  such prejudice, it melted away when the envoy of the Quakers promised to  procure wagons for the army. The story of Braddock's disaster does not  belong here, but Franklin formed a shrewd estimate of the man which  proved accurate. His account of Braddock's opinion of the colonial  militia is given in a sentence: \"He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd,  'These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American  militia, but upon the King's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is  impossible they should make any impression.'\" After Braddock's defeat  the Pennsylvania Assembly voted more money for defense, and the  unmilitary Franklin was placed in command of the frontier with full  power. He built forts, as he had planned, and incidentally learned much  of the beliefs of a group of settlers in the back country, the \"Unitas  Fratrum,\" better known as the Moravians.    The death struggle between English and French in America served only to  intensify a lesser conflict that was being waged between the Assembly  and the proprietors of Pennsylvania; and the Assembly determined to  send Franklin to London to seek judgment against the proprietors and to  request the King to take away from them the government of Pennsylvania.  Franklin, accompanied by his son William, reached London in July, 1757,  and from this time on his life was to be closely linked with Europe. He  returned to America six years later and made a trip of sixteen hundred  miles inspecting postal affairs, but in 1764 he was again sent to  England to renew the petition for a royal government for Pennsylvania,  which had not yet been granted. Presently that petition was made  obsolete by the Stamp Act, and Franklin became the representative of the  American colonies against King and Parliament.    Franklin did his best to avert the Revolution. He made many friends in  England, wrote pamphlets and articles, told comical stories and fables  where they might do some good, and constantly strove to enlighten the  ruling class of England upon conditions and sentiment in the colonies.  His examination before the House of Commons in February, 1766, marks  perhaps the zenith of his intellectual powers. His wide knowledge,  his wonderful poise, his ready wit, his marvelous gift for clear and  epigrammatic statement, were never exhibited to better advantage and no  doubt hastened the repeal of the Stamp Act. Franklin remained in England  nine years longer, but his efforts to reconcile the conflicting claims  of Parliament and the colonies were of no avail, and early in 1775 he  sailed for home.    Franklin's stay in America lasted only eighteen months, yet during that  time he sat in the Continental Congress and as a member of the most  important committees; submitted a plan for a union of the colonies;  served as Postmaster General and as chairman of the Pennsylvania  Committee of Safety; visited Washington at Cambridge; went to Montreal  to do what he could for the cause of independence in Canada; presided  over the convention which framed a constitution for Pennsylvania; was  a member of the committee appointed to draft the Declaration of  Independence and of the committee sent on the futile mission to New York  to discuss terms of peace with Lord Howe.    In September, 1776, Franklin was appointed envoy to France and sailed  soon afterwards. The envoys appointed to act with him proved a handicap  rather than a help, and the great burden of a difficult and momentous  mission was thus laid upon an old man of seventy. But no other American  could have taken his place. His reputation in France was already made,  through his books and inventions and discoveries. To the corrupt and  licentious court he was the personification of the age of simplicity,  which it was the fashion to admire; to the learned, he was a sage; to  the common man he was the apotheosis of all the virtues; to the rabble  he was little less than a god. Great ladies sought his smiles; nobles  treasured a kindly word; the shopkeeper hung his portrait on the wall;  and the people drew aside in the streets that he might pass without  annoyance. Through all this adulation Franklin passed serenely, if not  unconsciously.    The French ministers were not at first willing to make a treaty  of alliance, but under Franklin's influence they lent money to the  struggling colonies. Congress sought to finance the war by the issue of  paper currency and by borrowing rather than by taxation, and sent bill  after bill to Franklin, who somehow managed to meet them by putting  his pride in his pocket, and applying again and again to the French  Government. He fitted out privateers and negotiated with the British  concerning prisoners. At length he won from France recognition of the  United States and then the Treaty of Alliance.    Not until two years after the Peace of 1783 would Congress permit the  veteran to come home. And when he did return in 1785 his people would  not allow him to rest. At once he was elected President of the Council  of Pennsylvania and twice reelected in spite of his protests. He was  sent to the Convention of 1787 which framed the Constitution of the  United States. There he spoke seldom but always to the point, and the  Constitution is the better for his suggestions. With pride he axed his  signature to that great instrument, as he had previously signed the  Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, and the Treaty of  Paris.    Benjamin Franklin's work was done. He was now an old man of eighty-two  summers and his feeble body was racked by a painful malady. Yet he kept  his face towards the morning. About a hundred of his letters,  written after this time, have been preserved. These letters show no  retrospection, no looking backward. They never mention \"the good old  times.\" As long as he lived, Franklin looked forward. His interest  in the mechanical arts and in scientific progress seems never to have  abated. He writes in October, 1787, to a friend in France, describing  his experience with lightning conductors and referring to the work of  David Rittenhouse, the celebrated astronomer of Philadelphia. On the  31st of May in the following year he is writing to the Reverend John  Lathrop of Boston:    \"I have long been impressed with the same sentiments you so well  express, of the growing felicity of mankind, from the improvement  in philosophy, morals, politics, and even the conveniences of common  living, and the invention of new and useful utensils and instruments;  so that I have sometimes wished it had been my destiny to be born two or  three centuries hence. For invention and improvement are prolific, and  beget more of their kind. The present progress is rapid. Many of great  importance, now unthought of, will, before that period, be produced.\"    Thus the old philosopher felt the thrill of dawn and knew that the day  of great mechanical inventions was at hand. He had read the meaning of  the puffing of the young steam engine of James Watt and he had heard of  a marvelous series of British inventions for spinning and weaving. He  saw that his own countrymen were astir, trying to substitute the power  of steam for the strength of muscles and the fitful wind. John Fitch on  the Delaware and James Rumsey on the Potomac were already moving vessels  by steam. John Stevens of New York and Hoboken had set up a machine shop  that was to mean much to mechanical progress in America. Oliver Evans,  a mechanical genius of Delaware, was dreaming of the application  of high-pressure steam to both road and water carriages. Such  manifestations, though still very faint, were to Franklin the signs of a  new era."]]]
