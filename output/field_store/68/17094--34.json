After awhile that ugly  Irishwoman, who lives in Mr. Slater's house, came into the back gate:  you know the one I mean,--the one that threw cold water on me last  spring. When I saw her coming I felt sure that she and Mary meant to  kill me, while you were all away; so I jumped down out of the tree, and  split my best claw in my hurry, and ran off into Baker's Grove, and  stayed there all the rest of the day, in dreadful misery from cold and  hunger. There was some snow in the hollows, and I wet my feet, which  always makes me feel wretchedly; and I could not find any thing to eat  except a thin dried-up old mole. They are never good in the spring.  Really, nobody does know what hard lives we cats lead, even the luckiest  of us! After dark, I went home; but Mary had fastened up every door,  even the little one into the back shed. So I had to jump into the cellar  window, which is a thing I never like to do since I got that bad sprain  in my shoulder from coming down on the edge of a milk-pan. I crept up to  the head of the kitchen stairs, as still as a mouse, if I'm any judge,  and listened there for a long time, to try and make out, from Mary's  talk with the Irishwoman, what they were planning to do. But I never  could understand Irish, and although I listened till I had cramps in all  my legs, from being so long in one position, I was no wiser. Even the  things Mary said I could not understand, and I usually understand her  very easily. I passed a very uncomfortable night in the carrot bin. As  soon as I heard Mary coming down the cellar stairs, this morning, I hid  in the arch, and while she was skimming the milk, I slipped upstairs,  and ran into the sitting-room. Every thing there is in the same  confusion; the carpet is gone; and the windows too, and I think some of  the chairs have been carried away. All the china is in great baskets on  the pantry floor; and your father and mother's clothes are all taken out  of the nursery closet, and laid on chairs. It is very dreadful to have  to stand and see all this, and not be able to do any thing. I don't  think I ever fully realized before the disadvantage of being only a cat.  I have just been across the street, and talked it all over with the  Judge's cat, but she is very old and stupid, and so taken up with her  six kittens (who are the ugliest I ever saw), that she does not take  the least interest in her neighbors' affairs. Mrs. Hitchcock walked by  the house this morning, and I ran out to her, and took her dress in my  teeth and pulled it, and did all I could to make her come in, but she  said, \"No, no, pussy, I'm not coming in to-day; your mistress is not at  home.\" I declare I could have cried. I sat down in the middle of the  path, and never stirred for half an hour.    I heard your friend, Hannah Dorrance, say yesterday, that she was going  to write to you to-day, so I shall run up the hill now and carry my  letter to her. I think she will be astonished when she sees me, for I am  very sure that no other cat in town knows how to write. Do come home as  soon as possible.         Your affectionate Pussy.    P. S. Two men have just driven up to the front gate in a great cart, and  they are putting all the carpets into it. Oh dear, oh dear, if I only  knew what to do! And I just heard Mary say to them, \"Be as quick as you  can, for I want to get through with this business before the folks come  back.\"         [Illustration: \"I climbed up the old apple-tree, and crawled out on       a branch from which I could look directly into the parlor       windows.\"--Page 38.]         [Illustration: \"I crept up to the head of the kitchen stairs, as       still as a mouse, if I'm any judge, and listened.\"--Page 40.]          III.      My Dear Helen:    I am too stiff and sore from a terrible fall I have had, to write more  than one line; but I must let you know that my fright was very silly,  and I am very much mortified about it. The house and the things are all  safe; your mother has come home; and I will write, and tell you all,  just as soon as I can use my pen without great pain.    Some new people have come to live in the Nelson house; very nice people,  I think, for they keep their milk in yellow crockery pans. They have  brought with them a splendid black cat whose name is Caesar, and  everybody is talking about him. He has the handsomest whiskers I ever  saw. I do hope I shall be well enough to see him before long, but I  wouldn't have him see me now for any thing.         Your affectionate Pussy.         [Illustration: \"They have brought with them a splendid black cat       whose name is Caesar, and everybody is talking about him. He has the       handsomest whiskers I ever saw.\"--Page 46.]          IV.      My Dear Helen:    There is one thing that cats don't like any better than men and women  do, and that is to make fools of themselves. But a precious fool I made  of myself when I wrote you that long letter about Mary's moving out all  the furniture, and taking the house down. It is very mortifying to have  to tell you how it all turned out, but I know you love me enough to be  sorry that I should have had such a terrible fright for nothing.    It went on from bad to worse for three more days after I wrote you. Your  mother did not come home; and the awful Irishwoman was here all the  time. I did not dare to go near the house, and I do assure you I nearly  starved: I used to lie under the rose-bushes, and watch as well as I  could what was going on: now and then I caught a rat in the barn, but  that sort of hearty food never has agreed with me since I came to live  with you, and became accustomed to a lighter diet. By the third day I  felt too weak and sick to stir: so I lay still all day on the straw in  Charlie's stall; and I really thought, between the hunger and the  anxiety, that I should die. About noon I heard Mary say in the shed, \"I  do believe that everlasting cat has taken herself off: it's a good  riddance anyhow, but I should like to know what has become of the plaguy  thing!\"    I trembled all over, for if she had come into the barn I know one kick  from her heavy foot would have killed me, and I was quite too weak to  run away. Towards night I heard your dear mother's voice calling, \"Poor  pussy, why, poor pussy, where are you?\"    I assure you, my dear Helen, people are very much mistaken who say, as I  have often overheard them, that cats have no feeling. If they could only  know how I felt at that moment, they would change their minds. I was  almost too glad to make a sound. It seemed to me that my feet were  fastened to the floor, and that I never could get to her. She took me up  in her arms, and carried me through the kitchen into the sitting-room.  Mary was frying cakes in the kitchen, and as your mother passed by the  stove she said in her sweet voice, \"You see I've found poor pussy,  Mary.\" \"Humph,\" said Mary, \"I never thought but that she'd be found fast  enough when she wanted to be!\" I knew that this was a lie, because I had  heard what she said in the shed. I do wish I knew what makes her hate me  so: I only wish she knew how I hate her. I really think I shall gnaw her  stockings and shoes some night. It would not be any more than fair; and  she would never suspect me, there are so many mice in her room, for I  never touch one that I think belongs in her closet.    The sitting-room was all in most beautiful order,--a smooth white  something, like the side of a basket, over the whole floor, a beautiful  paper curtain, pink and white, over the fire-place, and white muslin  curtains at the windows. I stood perfectly still in the middle of the  room for some time. I was too surprised to stir. Oh, how I wished that I  could speak, and tell your dear mother all that had happened, and how  the room had looked three days before. Presently she said, \"Poor pussy,  I know you are almost starved, aren't you?\" and I said \"Yes,\" as plainly  as I could mew it. Then she brought me a big soup-plate full of thick  cream, and some of the most delicious cold hash I ever tasted; and after  I had eaten it all, she took me in her lap, and said, \"Poor pussy, we  miss little Helen, don't we?\" and she held me in her lap till bed-time.  Then she let me sleep on the foot of her bed: it was one of the happiest  nights of my life. In the middle of the night I was up for a while, and  caught the smallest mouse I ever saw out of the nest. Such little ones  are very tender.    In the morning I had my breakfast with her in the dining-room, which  looks just as nice as the sitting-room. After breakfast Mrs. Hitchcock  came in, and your mother said: \"Only think, how fortunate I am; Mary did  all the house-cleaning while I was away. Every room is in perfect order;  all the woollen clothes are put away for the summer. Poor pussy, here,  was frightened out of the house, and I suppose we should all have been  if we had been at home.\"    Can you imagine how ashamed I felt? I ran under the table and did not  come out again until after Mrs. Hitchcock had gone. But now comes  the saddest part of my story. Soon after this, as I was looking out of  the window, I saw the fattest, most tempting robin on the ground under  the cherry-tree: the windows did not look as if they had any glass in  them, and I took it for granted that it had all been taken out and put  away upstairs, with the andirons and the carpets, for next winter. I  knew that there was no time to be lost if I meant to catch that robin,  so I ran with all my might and tried to jump through. Oh, my dear Helen,  I do not believe you ever had such a bump: I fell back nearly into the  middle of the room; and it seemed to me that I turned completely over at  least six times. The blood streamed out of my nose, and I cut my right  ear very badly against one of the castors of the table. I could not see  nor hear any thing for some minutes. When I came "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32189"],[0,"The Raising and Care of Guinea Pigs (#3)"],[1,"purposes, however, we think it is best to get new males  every now and then. If you have only one male at the start, you should  get a new one when the young ones of your first litter are old enough to  breed. This will permit you to get stock not closely related and that  you can sell for breeding and pet purposes.    It is best to breed males and females of different ages. Have one older  than the other. The females should not be handled too much when they are  with young, as it is apt to injure them, and, of course, no animal  thrives as well when fondled. Always keep your strongest and best males  for breeders.    Too frequent littering tends to weaken both the mother and the little  ones. If you have a female that gives weak young that are dead at birth  or die soon after, give her a rest of several months before breeding her  again. It is best to have fewer litters and stronger stock.    The old males will sometimes fight when in the pen together, but it is  seldom that the females do not get along well together. If you have a  fighting male keep him in a place to himself, as he is apt to injure the  other males.    Good young breeding stock is to be preferred by one beginning to raise  Cavies, because they have a longer life before them and if you get old  stock you cannot tell how old they are. Guinea Pigs live to be about  seven or eight years old and if you buy young stock you have them for  their entire breeding age.          CHAPTER VII    EXHIBITING CAVIES.      The showing or exhibiting of Guinea Pigs is rapidly becoming more  popular and in nearly all pet stock and poultry shows you will find  several pens of Guinea Pigs. There are many fanciers in the country who  make a specialty of show animals and fancy stock.    In judging Cavies, the size, shape, condition, and color are the main  things to take into consideration. The selfs or solid colors must have  every hair of the same color. Any white whatever will disbar a pig that  is otherwise red. In the broken colors the different patches should be  uniform in size and the colors not run into each other. Fancy stock is  nearly always line bred and great pains should be taken in breeding. To  secure the best stock the females are only bred twice or three times a  year and every care is taken of them from birth. They are bred for  size, shape and color. Even if you are not breeding for fancy stock, it  will often pay you to enter your best specimens in local poultry and pet  stock shows, as it gives you some good advertising and you will often  take good prizes. It lets people know you have stock and you can always  get good prices for your prize winners. Always enter as near a uniform  lot as possible in singles, pairs or trios, or even larger pens.    While it costs more to produce fancy stock, still the higher prices you  can get for it makes it pay. If you are raising only comparatively few  pigs it might pay you to go in for fancy stock. Even if you have a large  stock you can keep a few of your best specimens separate and give them  little better attention.    Of course, many of the large commercial raisers never bother about fancy  stock as it does not pay when you are raising large numbers of them.    Most of the shows are under the auspices of some pet stock association  and a book of the standards can be secured from the secretary. We are  giving below some of the classes under which stock is shown.      Selfs.    Solid colors throughout with no odd colored hairs.      Tortoise Shells.    Black and red colors with patches clear and distinct and as nearly as  possible equal in size.      Tortoise and White.    Red, black and white patches, each clear cut with no running in of  colors. The more patches and the more uniform in size the better.      Dutch Marked.    Blazed face of wedge shape. A band of white straight hair around the  middle with no blending of colors. Feet white. Very rare.      Brindle.    Red and black evenly intermixed and perfectly brindled.      Agouti.    They are two shades, golden and gray. The golden should be rich brown  undercolor with even ticking and belly of deep red. The gray should be a  light shade with even ticking and belly of silver hue.    The eyes of all English Cavies should be large and bold. Head and  shoulders heavy, nose roman, ears drooping.    In the Abyssinians the rosettes should be as plentiful as possible and  the coat rough and wiry.    In the Peruvian the main thing to be considered is the length and  silkiness of the coat.    A book giving the standards as adopted by the National Pet Stock  Association of America can be obtained for 50c from its secretary, C. S.  Gibson, 1045 W. Warren Ave., Detroit, Mich.          CHAPTER VIII    SELLING AND SHIPPING.      Guinea Pigs are in such wide demand that it is not a hard matter to sell  them if you let people know you have them. There are dealers in various  sections of the country that buy in wholesale lots but the prices  obtained are usually not so high as if you find your own customers and  develop your own trade.    The hospitals, medical colleges, agricultural schools, veterinary  colleges, laboratories, pet stores, etc., are the heaviest users. You  can get in touch with them by writing them and telling them you have  Guinea Pigs for sale. The names of the hospitals and medical colleges  can be gotten from any doctor and you, of course, know your own state  University and Agricultural College.    Prices obtained for stock for experimental purposes are not as high as  when they are sold for pets and breeding purposes. You can build up a  good mail order business by putting a small classified advertisement in  the poultry and pet stock columns in the Sunday issue of some large city  newspaper near you. A classified ad in some of the poultry papers or  farm papers in your state will usually find you good customers.    In shipping to hospitals and laboratories always send your males first  and keep the females as when selling breeding stock you always have  calls for more females than males.    The prices you get, of course depend on circumstances. 50c is a fair  price for the general run of stock for experimental purposes. For pets  and breeding purposes you should get from $1.50 per pair and up. Prices  depend on supply and demand. $1.00 for females and 50c for males enable  you to make a good profit with them.    For experimental purposes they are usually sold by weight and are  salable from 9 ounces and up or when they are around six weeks old.      Shipping.    Guinea Pigs ship very easily. They go by express. Use a light but strong  box; in the summer have plenty of ventilation. Wire netting on the top  or sides of the box is good but slats and holes in the sides will do.    In the winter not so much ventilation is needed.    For food use plenty of hay together with some green food or carrots,  beets, etc. No water is necessary. Do not ship out during a real cold  spell in winter or a real hot spell in summer.    Do not have your box larger than necessary as it means added weight and  at the same time do not have it so small that they are crowded all over  each other.          CHAPTER IX    DISEASES.      Guinea Pigs are singularly free from disease and the breeder has little  to fear along this line. Of course improper food, irregular feeding  hours, poorly ventilated or exposed quarters will often cause trouble  but it is almost an unknown thing for an epidemic to get in a herd and  kill them off. As long as they are fed judiciously and their quarters  are kept sweet and clean and well protected from wind, rain and snow,  you will have little trouble. They are remarkably healthy little animals  but of course will not stand neglect or improper care. Do your share and  you will but seldom lose a Cavy.      Diarrhoea.    This is one of the most common troubles that a Cavy raiser has to  contend with. Too much green food, mouldy and half cured hay and a  sudden change of food is usually the cause. Give them plenty of good  sweet hay and cut out the green food for a while. A small spoon of olive  oil or a little castor oil is good to clean out the bowels.      Constipation.    Caused by not enough green food. This trouble is not apt to occur except  in winter when greens are scarce. Give them apple parings, any green  stuff you can get and a little olive oil. Always try and feed at least  once a day a little green stuff and you will have no trouble.      Premature Birth.    Females are occasionally lost when giving birth prematurely to little  ones and sometimes the young ones when born are so weak that they do not  live long. This is caused by too frequent littering, by fright, over  fatness or physical weakness. Over crowding in a cold drafty hutch in  severe weather may so weaken the mother that she bears weak ones. Take  especially good care of the pregnant females. Give them the choice food  and the best quarters. Do not let them breed too often or start too  young. Do not allow them to be handled or frightened.      Worms.    If a Guinea Pig is a good feeder and still does not grow, if he looks  unhealthy and his coat is not glossy he may have worms. Give a half  teaspoonful of any kind of worm medicine such as children use. Feed  lightly and not at all until the medicine has taken effect.      Going Light.    Sometimes in spite of all you can do a Guinea Pig goes light. If the  treatment for worms has no effect it may be tuberculosis. Separate at  once from the others. Give special diet of milk and bread or bran and  oats. If it does not get better destroy it as it does not pay to have  such stock around.      Colds, Pneumonia.    When they have pneumonia there is usually no help for them. Cold, damp  and drafty quarters are usually the cause. About the only thing to do is  to move them to warmer quarters, give warm milk and a few drops of any  good cold remedy that you may have in the house. As an ounce of  prevention is"]]]
