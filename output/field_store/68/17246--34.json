It did not  come to Adam, with the beasts.          Chapter VIII - The \"Bright Nature\" of man is taken away.    1 Then Adam cried and said, \"O God, when we lived in the garden, and  our hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels that sang praises in  heaven, but now we can't see like we used to; no, when we entered the  cave, all creation became hidden from us.\"    2 Then God the Lord said to Adam, \"When you were under subjection to  Me, you had a bright nature within you, and for that reason could you  see things far away.  But after your transgression your bright nature  was withdrawn from you; and it was not left to you to see things far  away, but only near at hand; after the ability of the flesh; for it is  brutish.\"    3 When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they went their  way; praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.    4 And God ceased to commune with them.          Chapter IX - Water from the Tree of Life.  Adam and Eve near drowning.    1 Then Adam and Eve came out of the Cave of Treasures, and went near to  the garden gate, and there they stood to look at it, and cried for  having come away from it.    2 And Adam and Eve went from before the gate of the garden to the  southern side of it, and found there the water that watered the garden,  from the root of the Tree of Life, and that split itself from there  into four rivers over the earth.    3 Then they came and went near to that water, and looked at it; and saw  that it was the water that came forth from under the root of the Tree  of Life in the garden.    4 And Adam cried and wailed, and beat his chest, for being severed from  the garden; and said to Eve:--    5 \"Why have you brought on me, on yourself, and on our descendants, so  many of these plagues and punishments?\"    6 And Eve said to him, \"What is it you have seen that has caused you to  cry and to speak to me in this manner?\"    7 And he said to Eve, \"Do you not see this water that was with us in  the garden, that watered the trees of the garden, and flowed out from  there?    8 And we, when we were in the garden, did not care about it; but since  we came to this strange land, we love it, and turn it to use for our  body.\"    9 But when Eve heard these words from him, she cried; and from the  soreness of their crying, they fell into that water; and would have put  an end to themselves in it, so as never again to return and behold the  creation; for when they looked at the work of creation, they felt they  must put an end to themselves.          Chapter X - Their bodies need water after they leave the garden.    1 Then God, merciful and gracious, looked at them thus lying in the  water, and close to death, and sent an angel, who brought them out of  the water, and laid them on the seashore as dead.    2 Then the angel went up to God, was welcome, and said, \"O God, Your  creatures have breathed their last.\"    3 Then God sent His Word to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their  death.    4 And Adam said, after he was raised, \"O God, while we were in the  garden we did not require, or care for this water; but since we came to  this land we cannot do without it.\"    5 Then God said to Adam, \"While you were under My command and were a  bright angel, you knew not this water.    6 But now that you have transgressed My commandment, you can not do  without water, wherein to wash your body and make it grow; for it is  now like that of beasts, and is in want of water.\"    7 When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they cried a bitter  cry; and Adam entreated God to let him return into the garden, and look  at it a second time.    8 But God said to Adam, \"I have made you a promise; when that promise  is fulfilled, I will bring you back into the garden, you and your  righteous descendants.\"    9 And God ceased to commune with Adam.          Chapter XI - A recollection of the glorious days in the Garden.    1 Then Adam and Eve felt themselves burning with thirst, and heat, and  sorrow.    2 And Adam said to Eve, \"We shall not drink of this water, even if we  were to die.  O Eve, when this water comes into our inner parts, it  will increase our punishments and that of our descendants.\"    3 Both Adam and Eve then went away from the water, and drank none of it  at all; but came and entered the Cave of Treasures.    4 But when in it Adam could not see Eve; he only heard the noise she  made.  Neither could she see Adam, but heard the noise he made.    5 Then Adam cried, in deep affliction, and beat his chest; and he got  up and said to Eve, \"Where are you?\"    6 And she said to him, \"Look, I am standing in this darkness.\"    7 He then said to her, \"Remember the bright nature in which we lived,  when we lived in the garden!    8 O Eve!  Remember the glory that rested on us in the garden.  O Eve!  Remember the trees that overshadowed us in the garden while we moved  among them.    9 O Eve!  Remember that while we were in the garden, we knew neither  night nor day.  Think of the Tree of Life, from below which flowed the  water, and that shed lustre over us!  Remember, O Eve, the garden land,  and the brightness thereof!    10 Think, oh think of that garden in which was no darkness, while we  lived in it.    11 Whereas no sooner did we come into this Cave of Treasures than  darkness surrounded us all around; until we can no longer see each  other; and all the pleasure of this life has come to an end.\"          Chapter XII - How darkness came between Adam and Eve.    1 Then Adam beat his chest, he and Eve, and they mourned the whole  night until the crack of dawn, and they sighed over the length of the  night in Miyazia.    2 And Adam beat himself, and threw himself on the ground in the cave,  from bitter grief, and because of the darkness, and lay there as dead.    3 But Eve heard the noise he made in falling on the ground.  And she  felt about for him with her hands, and found him like a corpse.    4 Then she was afraid, speechless, and remained by him.    5 But the merciful Lord looked on the death of Adam, and on Eve's  silence from fear of the darkness.    6 And the Word of God came to Adam and raised him from his death, and  opened Eve's mouth that she might speak.    7 Then Adam stood up in the cave and said, \"O God, why has light  departed from us, and darkness covered us?  Why did you leave us in  this long darkness?  Why do you plague us like this?    8 And this darkness, O Lord, where was it before it covered us?  It is  because of this that we cannot see each other.    9 For so long as we were in the garden, we neither saw nor even knew  what darkness is.  I was not hidden from Eve, neither was she hidden  from me, until now that she cannot see me; and no darkness came over us  to separate us from each other.    10 But she and I were both in one bright light.  I saw her and she saw  me.  Yet now since we came into this cave, darkness has covered us, and  separated us from each other, so that I do not see her, and she does  not see me.    11 O Lord, will You then plague us with this darkness?\"          Chapter XIII - The fall of Adam.  Why night and day were created.    1 Then when God, who is merciful and full of pity, heard Adam's voice,  He said to him:--    2 \"O Adam, so long as the good angel was obedient to Me, a bright light  rested on him and on his hosts.    3 But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived him of that  bright nature, and he became dark.    4 And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he knew  nothing of darkness.    5 But he transgressed, and I made him fall from the heaven onto the  earth; and it was this darkness that came over him.    6 And on you, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient to Me, did that  bright light rest also.    7 But when I heard of your transgression, I deprived you of that bright  light.  Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn you into darkness, but I made  you your body of flesh, over which I spread this skin, in order that it  may bear cold and heat.    8 If I had let My wrath fall heavily on you, I should have destroyed  you; and had I turned you into darkness, it would have been as if I had  killed you.    9 But in My mercy, I have made "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#3)"],[1,"document. Yet taking all this for granted, what length of time is afforded  for Oderigi to display his powers, on the strength of seeing Giotto's  models; for Oderigi, who having been already some time before deceased, was  found by Dante in purgatory, according to Baldinucci's computation, in the  year 1300?    I therefore refer this miniaturist to the Bolognese School, most probably  as a disciple, assuredly as a master; and, on the authority of Vellutello,  as the master of Franco, both a miniaturist and a painter. Franco is the  first among the Bolognese who instructed many pupils; and he is almost  deserving the name of the Giotto of this school. Nevertheless he approached  only at considerable distance, the Giotto of Florence, as far as we can  judge from the few relics which are now pointed out as his in the Malvezzi  museum. The most undoubted specimen is one of the Virgin, seated on a  throne, bearing the date of 1313; a production that may compare with the  works of Cimabue, or of Guido da Siena. There are also two diminutive  paintings, displaying much grace, and similar miniatures, ascribed to the  same hand.    The most eminent pupils educated by Franco in his school, according to  Malvasia, are by name, Vitale, Lorenzo, Simone, Jacopo, Cristoforo;  specimens of whose paintings in fresco are still seen at the Madonna di  Mezzaratta. This church, in respect to the Bolognese, exhibits the same  splendor as the Campo Santo of Pisa, in relation to the Florentine School;  a studio in which the most distinguished trecentisti who flourished in the  adjacent parts, competed for celebrity. They cannot, indeed, boast all the  simplicity, the elegance, the happy distribution, which form the excellence  of the Giottesque; but they display a fancy, fire, and method of colouring,  which led Bonarruoti and the Caracci, considering the times in which they  lived, not to undervalue them; insomuch that, on their shewing signs of  decay, these artists took measures for their preservation. In the  forementioned church, then, besides the pupils of Franco already named,  Galasso of Ferrara, and an unknown imitator of the style of Giotto,  asserted by Lamo in his MS. to have been Giotto himself, painted, at  different times, histories from the Old and New Testament. I am inclined  rather to pronounce the unknown artist to be Giotto's imitator; both  because Vasari, in Mezzaratta, makes no mention of Giotto, and because, if  the latter had painted, he would have ranked with the most eminent, and  would have been selected to pursue his labours, not in that corner  ornamented with paintings in the Florentine style, but in some more  imposing situation.    I ought not to omit to mention in this place, that Giotto employed himself  at Bologna. There is one of his altar-pieces still preserved at San Antonio  with the superscription of MAGISTER IOCTUS DE FLORENTIA. We, moreover,  learn from Vasari that Puccio Capanna, a Florentine, and Ottaviano da  Faenza, with one Pace da Faenza, all pupils of Giotto, pursued their  labours more or less at Bologna. Of these, if I mistake not, there are  occasional specimens still to be met with in collections and in churches.  Nor are there wanting works of the successors of Taddeo Gaddi, one of the  school of Giotto, which, as I have seen great numbers in Florence, I have  been able to distinguish with little difficulty among specimens of this  other school. Besides this style, another was introduced into Bologna from  Florence, that of Orcagna, whose Novissimi of S. Maria Novella were almost  copied in a chapel of San Petronio, painted after the year 1400; the same  edifice which Vasari on the strength of popular tradition, has asserted,  was ornamented by Buffalmacco. From this information, we are brought to  conclude that the Florentines exercised an influence over the art, even in  Bologna; nor can I commend Malvasia, who, in recounting the progress of his  school, gives them no place, nor makes them any acknowledgment. Their  models, which at that period were the most excellent in the art, there is  reason to suppose, may in those times have afforded assistance to the young  Bolognese artists, as those of the school of Caracci, in another age,  instructed the youth of Florence. It is time, however, to return to the  pictures of Mezzaratta.    The authors of those just recorded, were, some of them, contemporary with  the disciples of Giotto; others flourished subsequent to them; nor is there  any name more ancient than that of Vital da Bologna, called _dalle  Madonne_, of whom there are accounts from 1320 till the year 1345. This  artist, who painted for that church a picture of the Nativity, and from  whose hand one of S. Benedetto with other saints is seen in the Malvezzi  palace, had more dryness of design than belonged to the disciples of Giotto  at that period; and he employed compositions that differed from that  school, so extremely tenacious of Giotto's ideas. If Baldinucci ventured to  assert of him that his style, in every particular, agrees with that of his  Florentine contemporaries, he wrote on the faith of others; a sufficient  reason with him for affirming that he was pupil to Giotto, or to some one  of his disciples. I would not venture so far; but rather, to judge from the  hand of Vitale, which Baldi, in his Biblioteca Bolognese, entitles \"manum  elimatissimam,\" from the dryness of design, and from his almost exclusive  custom of painting Madonnas, I argue that he had not departed much from the  example set by Franco, more of a miniaturist than a painter, and that his  school could not have been that school more elevated, varied, and rich in  ideas, formed by Giotto.    Lorenzo, an artist, as is elsewhere observed, of Venice more probably than  of Bologna,[4] who produced the history of Daniel, on which he inscribed  his name, painted during the same period, and attempted copious  compositions. He was greatly inferior to the Memmi, to the Laurati, to the  Gaddi, though he is represented as their equal in reputation by Malvasia.  He betrays the infancy of the art, no less in point of design than in the  expressions of his countenances, whose grief sometimes provokes a smile;  and in his forced and extravagant attitudes in the manner of the Greeks.  Hence it is here out of the question to mention Giotto, in whose school,  cautiously avoiding every kind of extravagance, there predominates a  certain gravity and repose, occasionally amounting to coldness; described  by the author of the Bolognese Guide as the statuary manner; and it is one  of those marks by which to distinguish that school from others of the same  age.         Footnote 4: Vol. iii. p. 16.    At a later period flourished Galasso, who is to be sought for in the list  of artists of Ferrara, along with the three supposed disciples of Vitale;  namely, Cristoforo, Simone, and Jacopo; all of whom, in mature age, were  engaged in pictures to decorate the church at Mezzaratta, which were  completed in 1404. Vasari writes that he is uncertain whether Cristoforo  belonged to Ferrara, or da Modena; and whilst the two cities were disputing  the honour, the Bolognese historians, Baldi, Masini, and Bumaldo, adjusted  the difference by referring him to their own Felsina. For me his country  may remain matter of doubt, though not so the school in which he  flourished; inasmuch as he certainly resided, and painted a great deal,  both on altar-pieces and on walls, at Bologna. At that period, he must have  attracted the largest share of applause; since to him was committed the  figure of the altar, which is still in existence, with his name. The  Signori Malvezzi, likewise, are in possession of one of his altar-pieces,  abounding with figures of saints, and divided into ten compartments. The  design of these figures is rude, the colouring languid; but the whole  displays a taste assuredly not derived from the Florentines, and this is  the principal difficulty in the question.    Simone, most commonly called in Bologna Da Crocifissi, was eminent in these  sacred subjects. At S. Stefano, and other churches, he has exhibited  several fine specimens, by no means incorrect in the naked figure, with a  most devotional cast of features, extended arms, and a drapery of various  colours. They resemble Giotto's in point of colouring, and in the posture  of the feet, one of which is placed over the other, but in other respects  they approach nearer the more ancient. I have seen also some Madonnas  painted by him; sometimes in a sitting posture, at others in half-size,  with drapery and with hands in the manner of the Greek paintings. In  features, however, and in the attitudes, they are both carefully studied  and commendable for those times; a specimen of which is still to be seen at  S. Michele in Bosco.    Among the Bolognese trecentisti Jacopo Avanzi is the most distinguished. He  produced the chief part of the histories at the church of Mezzaratta, many  in conjunction with Simone, and a few of them alone; as the miracle of the  Probation, at the bottom of which he wrote _Jacobus pinxit_. He appears to  have employed himself with most success in the chapel of S. Jacopo al  Santo, at Padua, where, in some very spirited figures, representing some  exploit of arms, he may be said to have conformed his style pretty nearly  to the Giottesque; and even in some measure to have surpassed Giotto, who  was not skilful in heroic subjects. His masterpiece seems to have been the  triumphs painted in a saloon at Verona, a work commended by Mantegna  himself as an excellent production. He subscribed his name sometimes  _Jacobus Pauli_; which has led me to doubt whether he was not originally  from Venice, and the same artist who, together with Paolo his father, and  his brother Giovanni, painted the ancient altar-piece of San Marco at that  place. The time exactly favours such a supposition; the resemblance between  the countenances in the "]]]
