[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#3)"],[1," acid  must have either added something to the sugar molecules, or  subtracted something from them. It was the latter. Here, then, is  a force entirely different from the one which tends to reduce  masses to molecules. The molecule has the same properties as the  mass. Only a physical force was used in dissolving the sugar, and  no heat was liberated. The acid has changed the sugar into a  black mass, in fact into charcoal or carbon, and water; and heat  has been produced. A chemical change has been brought about.    From this we see that molecules are not the ultimate divisions of  matter. The smallest sugar particles are made up of still smaller  particles of other things which do not resemble sugar, as a word  is composed of letters which alone do not resemble the word. But  can the charcoal itself be resolved into other substances, and  these into still others, and so on? Carbon is one of the  substances from which nothing else has been obtained. There are  about seventy others which have not been resolved. These are  called elements; and out of them are built all the compounds--  mineral, vegetable, and animal--which we know.    8. An element is a chemically indivisible substance, or one from  which nothing else can be extracted.    A compound is a substance which is made up of elements united in  exact proportions by a force called chemism, or chemical  affinity.    A mixture is composed of two or more elements or compounds  blended together, but not held by any chemical attraction.    To which of these three classes does sugar belong? Carbon? The  solution of sugar in water?    Carbon is an element; we call its smallest particle an atom.    An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can enter  into combination. Atoms are indivisible and usually do not exist  alone. Both elements and compounds have molecules.    The molecule of an element usually contains two atoms; that of a  compound may have two, or it may have hundreds. For a given  compound the number is always definite.    Chemism is the force that binds atoms together to form molecules.  The sugar molecule contains atoms, forty-five in all, of three  different elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. That of salt  has two atoms: one of sodium, one of chlorine. Should we say \"an  atom of sugar\"? Why? Of what is a mass of sugar made up? A  molecule? A mass of carbon? A molecule? Did the chemical affinity  of the acid break up masses or molecules? In this respect it is a  type of all chemical action. The distinction between physics and  chemistry is here well shown. The molecule is the unit of the  physicist, the atom that of the chemist. However large the masses  changed by chemical action, that action is always on the  individual molecule, the atoms of which are separated. If the  molecule were an indivisible particle, no science of chemistry  would be possible. The physicist finds the properties of masses  of matter and resolves them into molecules, the chemist breaks up  the molecule and from its atoms builds up other compounds.    Analysis is the separation of compounds into their elements.    Synthesis is the building up of compounds from their elements.    Of which is the sugar experiment an example? Metathesis is an  exchange of atoms in two different compounds; it gives rise to  still other compounds.    A chemical change may add something to a substance, or subtract  something from it, or it may both subtract and add, making a new  substance with entirely different properties. Sulphur and carbon  are two stable solids. The chemical union of the two forms a  volatile liquid. A substance may be at one time a solid, at  another a liquid, at another a gas, and yet not undergo any  chemical change, because in each case the chemical composition is  identical.    State which of these are chemical changes: rusting of iron,  falling of rain, radiation of heat, souring of milk, evaporation  of water, decay of vegetation, burning of wood, breaking of iron,  bleaching of cloth. Give any other illustrations that occur to  you.    Chemistry treats of matter in its simplest forms, and of the  various combinations of those simplest forms.    CHAPTER III.    MOLECULES AND ATOMS.    9. Molecules are Extremely Small.--It has been estimated that a  liter of any gas at 0 degrees and 760 mm. pressure contains 10^24  molecules, i.e. one with twenty-four ciphers.    Thomson estimates that if a drop of water were magnified to the  size of the earth, and its molecules increased in the same  proportion, they would be larger than fine shot, but not so large  as cricket balls.    A German has recently obtained a deposit of silver two-millionths  of a millimeter thick, and visible to the naked eye. The computed  diameter of the molecule is only one and a half millionths of a  millimeter.    By a law of chemistry there is the same number of molecules in a  given volume of every gas, if the temperature and pressure are  the same. Hence, all gaseous molecules are of the same size,  including, of course, the surrounding space. They are in rapid  motion, and the lighter the gas the more rapid the motion. This  gives rise to diffusion. See page 114.    10. We Know Nothing Definite of the Form of Molecules.--In this  book they will always be represented as of the same size, that of  two squares. A molecule is itself composed of atoms,--from two to  several hundred. The size of the atom of most elements we  represent by one square.11. Atoms.--If the gaseous molecules be  of the same size, it is clear that either the atoms themselves  must be condensed, or the spaces between them must be smaller  than before. We suppose the latter to be the case, and that they  do not touch one another, the same thing being true of molecules.  Atoms composing sugar must be crowded nearer together than those  of salt. These atoms are probably in constant motion in the  molecule, as the latter is in the mass. If we regard this square  as a mass of matter, the dots may represent molecules; if we call  it a molecule, the dots may be called atoms, though many  molecules have no more than two or three atoms.    The following experiments illustrate the union of atoms to form  molecules, and of elements to form compounds.    12. Union of Atoms.    Experiment 6.--Mix, on a paper, 5 g. of iron turnings, and the  same bulk of powdered sulphur, and transfer them to an ignition  tube, a tube of hard glass for withstanding high temperatures.  Hold the tube in the flame of a burner till the contents have  become red-hot. After a minute break it by holding it under a jet  of water. Put the contents into an evaporating-dish, and look for  any uncombined iron or sulphur. Both iron and sulphur are  elements. Is this an example of synthesis or of analysis? Why? Is  the chemical union between masses of iron and sulphur, or between  molecules, or between atoms? Is the product a compound, an  element, or a mixture?    Experiment 7.--Try the same experiment, using copper instead of  iron. The full explanation of these experiments is given on page  13.    CHAPTER IV.    ELEMENTS AND BINARIES.    13. About Seventy Different Elements are now recognized, half of  which have been discovered within little more than a century.  These differ from one another in (1) atomic weight, (2) physical  and chemical properties, (3) mode of occurrence, etc. Page 12  contains the most important elements.    The symbol of an element is usually the initial letter or letters  of its Latin name, and stands for one atom of the element. C is  the symbol for carbon, and represents one atom of it. O means one  atom of oxygen.[The symbols of elements will also be used in this  book to stand for an indefinite quantity of them; e.g. O will be  used for oxygen in general as well as for one atom. The text will  readily decide when symbols have a definite meaning, and when  they are used in place of words.] Write, explain, and memorize  the symbols of the elements in heavy type.    14. The Atomic Weight of an element is the weight of its atom  compared with that of hydrogen. H is taken as the standard  because it has the least atomic weight. The atomic weight of O is  16, which means that its atom weighs 16 times as much as the H  atom. Every symbol, then, stands for a definite weight of the  element, i.e. its atomic weight, as well as for its atom.    How much bromine by weight does Br stand for? What do these  symbols mean--As, Na, N, P? If O represents one atom, how much  does O2 or 2 O stand for? How much by weight? Most elements have  two atoms in the molecule. How many molecules in 6 H? 10 N? S8?  I20?    The symbol of a compound is formed by writing in succession the  symbols of the elements of which it is composed. How many atoms  in the following molecules, and how many of each element: C2H60?  HNO3? PbSO4? MgCl2? (Hg2(NO3)2?)    15. The Simplest Compounds are Binaries.--A binary is a substance  composed of two elements; e.g. common salt, which is a compound  of sodium and chlorine. Its symbol is NaCl, its chemical name  sodium chloride. The ending ide is applied to the last name of  binaries. How many parts by weight of Na and of Cl in NaCl? What  is the molecular weight, i.e. the weight of its molecule? Name  KCl. How many atoms in its molecule? Parts by weight of each  element? Molecular weight? Does the symbol stand for more than  one molecule? How many molecules in 4 NaCl? How many atoms of Na  and of Cl? Name these: HCl, NaBr, NaI, KBr, AgCl, AgI, HBr, HI,  HF, HgO, ZnO, ZnS, MgO, CaO. Compute the proportion by weight of  each element in the last three.    A coefficient before the symbol of a compound includes all the  elements of the symbol, and shows the number of molecules. How  many in these: 6 KBr? 3 Sn0? 12 NaCl? How many atoms of each  element in the above?    An exponent, always written below, applies only to the element  after which it is written, and shows the number of atoms. Explain  these: AuCl3, ZnCl2, Hg2Cl2."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],[0,"Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#3)"],[1,"was safety and order  that they sought: the universe of Thomas Aquinas or Dante is as small  and neat as a Dutch interior. To us, to whom safety has become monotony,  to whom the primeval savageries of nature are so remote as to become a  mere pleasing condiment to our ordered routine, the world of dreams is  very different from what it was amid the wars of Guelf and Ghibelline.  Hence William James's protest against what he calls the \"block universe\"  of the classical tradition; hence Nietzsche's worship of force; hence  the verbal bloodthirstiness of many quiet literary men. The barbaric  substratum of human nature, unsatisfied in action, finds an outlet in  imagination. In philosophy, as elsewhere, this tendency is visible; and  it is this, rather than formal argument, that has thrust aside the  classical tradition for a philosophy which fancies itself more virile  and more vital.      B. Evolutionism    Evolutionism, in one form or another, is the prevailing creed of our  time. It dominates our politics, our literature, and not least our  philosophy. Nietzsche, pragmatism, Bergson, are phases in its  philosophic development, and their popularity far beyond the circles of  professional philosophers shows its consonance with the spirit of the  age. It believes itself firmly based on science, a liberator of hopes,  an inspirer of an invigorating faith in human power, a sure antidote to  the ratiocinative authority of the Greeks and the dogmatic authority of  mediaeval systems. Against so fashionable and so agreeable a creed it may  seem useless to raise a protest; and with much of its spirit every  modern man must be in sympathy. But I think that, in the intoxication of  a quick success, much that is important and vital to a true  understanding of the universe has been forgotten. Something of Hellenism  must be combined with the new spirit before it can emerge from the  ardour of youth into the wisdom of manhood. And it is time to remember  that biology is neither the only science, nor yet the model to which all  other sciences must adapt themselves. Evolutionism, as I shall try to  show, is not a truly scientific philosophy, either in its method or in  the problems which it considers. The true scientific philosophy is  something more arduous and more aloof, appealing to less mundane hopes,  and requiring a severer discipline for its successful practice.    Darwin's _Origin of Species_ persuaded the world that the difference  between different species of animals and plants is not the fixed,  immutable difference that it appears to be. The doctrine of natural  kinds, which had rendered classification easy and definite, which was  enshrined in the Aristotelian tradition, and protected by its supposed  necessity for orthodox dogma, was suddenly swept away for ever out of  the biological world. The difference between man and the lower animals,  which to our human conceit appears enormous, was shown to be a gradual  achievement, involving intermediate beings who could not with certainty  be placed either within or without the human family. The sun and planets  had already been shown by Laplace to be very probably derived from a  primitive more or less undifferentiated nebula. Thus the old fixed  landmarks became wavering and indistinct, and all sharp outlines were  blurred. Things and species lost their boundaries, and none could say  where they began or where they ended.    But if human conceit was staggered for a moment by its kinship with the  ape, it soon found a way to reassert itself, and that way is the  \"philosophy\" of evolution. A process which led from the amoeba to man  appeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress--though whether  the amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known. Hence the cycle  of changes which science had shown to be the probable history of the  past was welcomed as revealing a law of development towards good in the  universe--an evolution or unfolding of an ideal slowly embodying itself  in the actual. But such a view, though it might satisfy Spencer and  those whom we may call Hegelian evolutionists, could not be accepted as  adequate by the more whole-hearted votaries of change. An ideal to which  the world continuously approaches is, to these minds, too dead and  static to be inspiring. Not only the aspirations, but the ideal too,  must change and develop with the course of evolution; there must be no  fixed goal, but a continual fashioning of fresh needs by the impulse  which is life and which alone gives unity to the process.    Ever since the seventeenth century, those whom William James described  as the \"tender-minded\" have been engaged in a desperate struggle with  the mechanical view of the course of nature which physical science seems  to impose. A great part of the attractiveness of the classical tradition  was due to the partial escape from mechanism which it provided. But now,  with the influence of biology, the \"tender-minded\" believe that a more  radical escape is possible, sweeping aside not merely the laws of  physics, but the whole apparently immutable apparatus of logic, with its  fixed concepts, its general principles, and its reasonings which seem  able to compel even the most unwilling assent. The older kind of  teleology, therefore, which regarded the End as a fixed goal, already  partially visible, towards which we were gradually approaching, is  rejected by M. Bergson as not allowing enough for the absolute dominion  of change. After explaining why he does not accept mechanism, he  proceeds:[5]    \"But radical finalism is quite as unacceptable, and for the same reason.  The doctrine of teleology, in its extreme form, as we find it in Leibniz  for example, implies that things and beings merely realise a programme  previously arranged. But if there is nothing unforeseen, no invention or  creation in the universe, time is useless again. As in the mechanistic  hypothesis, here again it is supposed that _all is given_. Finalism thus  understood is only inverted mechanism. It springs from the same  postulate, with this sole difference, that in the movement of our finite  intellects along successive things, whose successiveness is reduced to a  mere appearance, it holds in front of us the light with which it claims  to guide us, instead of putting it behind. It substitutes the attraction  of the future for the impulsion of the past. But succession remains none  the less a mere appearance, as indeed does movement itself. In the  doctrine of Leibniz, time is reduced to a confused perception, relative  to the human standpoint, a perception which would vanish, like a rising  mist, for a mind seated at the centre of things.    \"Yet finalism is not, like mechanism, a doctrine with fixed rigid  outlines. It admits of as many inflections as we like. The mechanistic  philosophy is to be taken or left: it must be left if the least grain of  dust, by straying from the path foreseen by mechanics, should show the  slightest trace of spontaneity. The doctrine of final causes, on the  contrary, will never be definitively refuted. If one form of it be put  aside, it will take another. Its principle, which is essentially  psychological, is very flexible. It is so extensible, and thereby so  comprehensive, that one accepts something of it as soon as one rejects  pure mechanism. The theory we shall put forward in this book will  therefore necessarily partake of finalism to a certain extent.\"      [5] _Creative Evolution_, English translation, p. 41.    M. Bergson's form of finalism depends upon his conception of life. Life,  in his philosophy, is a continuous stream, in which all divisions are  artificial and unreal. Separate things, beginnings and endings, are mere  convenient fictions: there is only smooth, unbroken transition. The  beliefs of to-day may count as true to-day, if they carry us along the  stream; but to-morrow they will be false, and must be replaced by new  beliefs to meet the new situation. All our thinking consists of  convenient fictions, imaginary congealings of the stream: reality flows  on in spite of all our fictions, and though it can be lived, it cannot  be conceived in thought. Somehow, without explicit statement, the  assurance is slipped in that the future, though we cannot foresee it,  will be better than the past or the present: the reader is like the  child who expects a sweet because it has been told to open its mouth and  shut its eyes. Logic, mathematics, physics disappear in this philosophy,  because they are too \"static\"; what is real is an impulse and movement  towards a goal which, like the rainbow, recedes as we advance, and makes  every place different when we reach it from what it appeared to be at a  distance.    Now I do not propose at present to enter upon a technical examination of  this philosophy. At present I wish to make only two criticisms of  it--first, that its truth does not follow from what science has rendered  probable concerning the facts of evolution, and secondly, that the  motives and interests which inspire it are so exclusively practical, and  the problems with which it deals are so special, that it can hardly be  regarded as really touching any of the questions that to my mind  constitute genuine philosophy.    (1) What biology has rendered probable is that the diverse species arose  by adaptation from a less differentiated ancestry. This fact is in  itself exceedingly interesting, but it is not the kind of fact from  which philosophical consequences follow. Philosophy is general, and  takes an impartial interest in all that exists. The changes suffered by  minute portions of matter on the earth's surface are very important to  us as active sentient beings; but to us as philosophers they have no  greater interest than other changes in portions of matter elsewhere. And  if the changes on the earth's surface during the last few millions of  years appear to our present ethical notions to be in the"]]]
