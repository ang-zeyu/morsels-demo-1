(#3)"],[1,"from the city; and,  walking into it, shortly arrived at an open space, where some large  trees stood round and threw broad patches of shade over the grass.    We at once commenced our gambols. We rolled over one another, we sprang  over each other's backs, and hid behind the great beech trunks for the  pleasure of springing out upon our companions when they stealthily came  to look for us.    In the midst of our fun we observed that nurse had gone. We had been  so busied with our own diversions that not one of us had observed her  departure; but now that we found it out, we set off to discover where  she had strolled to. We observed her, after a few minutes, cosily seated  on a bank of violets, near the very same tortoise-shell footman, who  lived opposite our house, although how _he_ came there we could not  imagine. Nor indeed did we much trouble ourselves to guess. Seeing she  was so engaged we returned at once to our sport, and played none the  less heartily because nurse was not there to curb us.    I remember, as if it were only yesterday, the scene which followed.  I was amusing myself with one of my pretty cousins, who was dressed in  white, and was about my own age. I had thrown her down on the grass, and  was patting her with my paws, when I heard a scream; I turned quickly  round, just in time to see one of my sisters falling from a tall tree,  to which she had climbed with our young visitor, when, all of us running  up, we discovered that, on reaching the ground, she had struck her head  against a sharp stone, and was now bleeding and without motion.    Our cries brought nurse to the spot, who, as soon as she discovered all  the mischief that had been done, without saying a word started off with  all swiftness, with her tail in the air. We thought she had gone to  fetch assistance or to inform our mother of what had occurred; but as  she did not come back, and evening was fast setting in, we thought it  best to proceed towards home, although we did not much like meeting our  parents after what had happened.    There was no help for it however; so, giving a last frightened look at  our poor little sister, who was now quite dead and cold, we walked sadly  homewards, and reached the house just as night was falling.    I pass over what ensued,--my mother's grief, and her anger against  nurse, who, by the bye, never came back to express her sorrow; I pass  over also my mother's remarks upon the occasion; but I may observe,  that they, added to the sad accident itself, made so deep an impression  upon me, that whenever I felt inclined to disobey my good mother's  admonitions, the image of my dead sister would rise up before me, and,  although it did not, alas! _always_ prevent my being wicked, it often  did so, and on every occasion made me feel repentance for my error.          DANGERS.      My Father was what is called a sporting character. The quantity of rats  he caught, and of birds he ensnared, was almost incredible; and the fame  of his exploits spread throughout the neighbourhood.    A taste of so decided a kind, and a dexterity so remarkable, not  unnaturally extended to his offspring; and before we had attained our  full growth, we had all killed our rats and caught our birds.    To indulge this passion my father had two little huts, which he called  hunting-boxes, both conveniently situated for his favourite pursuits.  One was on the bank of the river, near some old timber, a famous haunt  of the rats, who had a colony close by; and the other was in a wooded  spot, overhung with trees, among which the birds loved to linger,  although many of their number waited there to their destruction.    My mother, who had been very delicately brought up, and who had very  strict notions concerning propriety in female Cats, was very anxious to  keep myself and sisters away from either of these places, although she  had, of course, no objection that our brother should visit them; but,  as we had been all educated together, we Pussies thought it rather hard  that Tommy should go whilst we were forced to stop at home; and, as our  father was very indulgent, we often managed to slip off unawares and  join him and our brother, trusting to his kindness to save us from our  mother's displeasure.    I happened to learn one day that several sporting Cats had been invited  to a great hunt, the place of meeting being my father's box beside the  river. I felt the greatest desire to be present at one of these affairs,  as Tommy's account of them had made my very mouth water. I knew it would  be vain to ask my mother's consent, as she would not only refuse it,  but would take measures to prevent my getting out if I felt inclined  to disobey. I therefore kept very quiet about the matter, but resolved  within myself to indulge my inclination, and get a peep at what was  going on.    \"It will be easy,\" I thought, \"to do so without any one being the wiser;  and even if I should be found out when I am there, I am sure father will  not be angry.\"    With this reflection, on the appointed morning I slipped off  unperceived, and, arriving at the hut a good hour before the time fixed,  I climbed up to the top by the help of a tree which grew near; and  stretching myself on the roof, with my eyes peering over the edge, just  where a branch of the elm I had got up by afforded me a shade, I waited  for the company.    They were not long in coming. My father and brother arrived first, and  a servant with some provisions; they were soon followed by an immense  White Cat with one eye (but what a fierce one it was!) and a handsome  Tabby, his son. Next came a Cat they called Mr. Dick, who wore a shabby  grey coat, rather torn and patchy, and whose tail was ragged and dirty,  yet to whom everybody showed a great deal of attention, because, as  I afterwards learnt, he was very rich and ill-tempered. There were two  or three others that I don't well remember, but which made the number  complete.    As soon as they were all assembled, they sat down to breakfast; and  I could see them through a chink in the roof as they demolished their  meal. I had taken the precaution to bring something to eat too, and  I now devoured it with much appetite; for the fresh morning air and my  elevated position had made me hungry. As I munched my food, I could hear  the conversation below, and was much edified by the terrible stories  which some of them told about the fights they had had with rats as big  as themselves, and the fierce battles they had won. I could not help  observing that although Mr. Dick's adventures were much less wonderful  than those of any other Cat present, they were heard with a great deal  more interest, and were applauded as infinitely more remarkable.    Word was now given to prepare for the coming hunt, and every Cat rose  from table, and came out among the timber. Hiding themselves behind  various logs, my father stood up and uttered a loud cry, which I  afterwards learnt was a signal for a quantity of ferrets, trained for  that purpose, to rush into the rats' holes to drive them out. As the  rats have the greatest horror of these creatures, they sprang from their  hiding-places in the wildest confusion, and were at once pounced upon by  the hidden Cats.    What a scene of confusion followed! The rats, who were scampering along,  over and under the logs to escape from the hated ferrets, were suddenly  aware of the presence of more detested and more formidable enemies, as,  one by one, the sporting Cats jumped up, and made a dash at their  bewildered prey.    My excitement at this spectacle was almost more than I could bear.  As the growls of my friends and kindred, joined to the screams of the  flying rats, became audible, and I could see the lashing of tails and  the fierce glances of bright eyes, accompanied every now and then by a  chase where some rat, which had been hiding beneath a log, suddenly  leaped across the open ground, I sprang to my feet, I ran hither and  thither, with my tail swollen to twice its natural size, from my  eagerness to participate in the so-called _sport_ of my relations.    I was not however destined to remain without my share of it, although  I did not stir from the spot where I had been concealed. I said that a  tree grew close to the hunting-box, on the roof of which I was placed,  and that it was by its help that I had climbed to my present elevation.  A large rat, with a body not very much smaller than my own, which had  managed to escape from the fight where so many of his friends and  relations had fallen, sought about for a place of refuge. Espying the  tree, and seeing that all his enemies were at that moment too much  engaged to attend to him, he sprang up the trunk and came rapidly  towards me, little expecting to find another of his foes so far away  from her companions. I watched him come, and resolved in my own mind  that he should not escape, although my heart beat a good deal at the  idea of the encounter.    The rat sprang on to the roof, and was going to scamper over it, when  his fierce little eyes,--and quick nose too, no doubt, for it moved  incessantly,--spied me out, crouching at a short distance and ready to  spring. He stopped an instant, as if considering what it were best to  do, then, thinking perhaps that if he attempted to run I should be at  once upon his back, and, I suppose, observing from my look that I was  only a Kitten after all, he came boldly towards me, and, just as I was  about to pounce upon him, he sprang, like a flash of lightning, at my  face, and made his sharp teeth meet in the most tender part of my nose.  In vain I shrieked and beat the terrible creature with all my strength  upon the roof; it was to no purpose that I fixed my sharp claws into  his sides, and tried to tear him from his hold; he would not let go, and  the pain was at last so great, that, squeezing him in my paws, I rolled  over and over in my agony. The roof was sloping, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32522"],[0,"Mr. Spaceship (#3)"],[1,"put his hand on the control board. \"There  are some changes here I don't understand.\"    \"Changes?\"    \"Alterations from the original design. I wonder what the purpose is.\"    Kramer took a set of the plans from his coat. \"Let me look.\" He turned  the pages over. The Pilot watched carefully over his shoulder.    \"The changes aren't indicated on your copy,\" the Pilot said. \"I  wonder--\" He stopped. Commander Gross had entered the control cabin.    \"Gross, who authorized alterations?\" Kramer said. \"Some of the wiring  has been changed.\"    \"Why, your old friend.\" Gross signaled to the field tower through the  window.    \"My old friend?\"    \"The Professor. He took quite an active interest.\" Gross turned to the  Pilot. \"Let's get going. We have to take this out past gravity for the  test they tell me. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Are you ready?\"    \"Sure.\" The Pilot sat down and moved some of the controls around.  \"Anytime.\"    \"Go ahead, then,\" Gross said.    \"The Professor--\" Kramer began, but at that moment there was a  tremendous roar and the ship leaped under him. He grasped one of the  wall holds and hung on as best he could. The cabin was filling with a  steady throbbing, the raging of the jet turbines underneath them.    The ship leaped. Kramer closed his eyes and held his breath. They were  moving out into space, gaining speed each moment.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Well, what do you think?\" Winter said nervously. \"Is it time yet?\"    \"A little longer,\" Kramer said. He was sitting on the floor of the  cabin, down by the control wiring. He had removed the metal  covering-plate, exposing the complicated maze of relay wiring. He was  studying it, comparing it to the wiring diagrams.    \"What's the matter?\" Gross said.    \"These changes. I can't figure out what they're for. The only pattern  I can make out is that for some reason--\"    \"Let me look,\" the Pilot said. He squatted down beside Kramer. \"You  were saying?\"    \"See this lead here? Originally it was switch controlled. It closed  and opened automatically, according to temperature change. Now it's  wired so that the central control system operates it. The same with  the others. A lot of this was still mechanical, worked by pressure,  temperature, stress. Now it's under the central master.\"    \"The brain?\" Gross said. \"You mean it's been altered so that the brain  manipulates it?\"    Kramer nodded. \"Maybe Professor Thomas felt that no mechanical relays  could be trusted. Maybe he thought that things would be happening too  fast. But some of these could close in a split second. The brake  rockets could go on as quickly as--\"    \"Hey,\" Winter said from the control seat. \"We're getting near the moon  stations. What'll I do?\"    They looked out the port. The corroded surface of the moon gleamed up  at them, a corrupt and sickening sight. They were moving swiftly toward  it.    \"I'll take it,\" the Pilot said. He eased Winter out of the way and  strapped himself in place. The ship began to move away from the moon  as he manipulated the controls. Down below them they could see the  observation stations dotting the surface, and the tiny squares that  were the openings of the underground factories and hangars. A red  blinker winked up at them and the Pilot's fingers moved on the board  in answer.    \"We're past the moon,\" the Pilot said, after a time. The moon had  fallen behind them; the ship was heading into outer space. \"Well, we  can go ahead with it.\"    Kramer did not answer.    \"Mr. Kramer, we can go ahead any time.\"    Kramer started. \"Sorry. I was thinking. All right, thanks.\" He  frowned, deep in thought.    \"What is it?\" Gross asked.    \"The wiring changes. Did you understand the reason for them when you  gave the okay to the workmen?\"    Gross flushed. \"You know I know nothing about technical material. I'm  in Security.\"    \"Then you should have consulted me.\"    \"What does it matter?\" Gross grinned wryly. \"We're going to have to  start putting our faith in the old man sooner or later.\"    The Pilot stepped back from the board. His face was pale and set.  \"Well, it's done,\" he said. \"That's it.\"    \"What's done?\" Kramer said.    \"We're on automatic. The brain. I turned the board over to it--to him,  I mean. The Old Man.\" The Pilot lit a cigarette and puffed nervously.  \"Let's keep our fingers crossed.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The ship was coasting evenly, in the hands of its invisible pilot. Far  down inside the ship, carefully armoured and protected, a soft human  brain lay in a tank of liquid, a thousand minute electric charges  playing over its surface. As the charges rose they were picked up and  amplified, fed into relay systems, advanced, carried on through the  entire ship--    Gross wiped his forehead nervously. \"So _he_ is running it, now. I  hope he knows what he's doing.\"    Kramer nodded enigmatically. \"I think he does.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Nothing.\" Kramer walked to the port. \"I see we're still moving in a  straight line.\" He picked up the microphone. \"We can instruct the  brain orally, through this.\" He blew against the microphone  experimentally.    \"Go on,\" Winter said.    \"Bring the ship around half-right,\" Kramer said. \"Decrease speed.\"    They waited. Time passed. Gross looked at Kramer. \"No change.  Nothing.\"    \"Wait.\"    Slowly, the ship was beginning to turn. The turbines missed, reducing  their steady beat. The ship was taking up its new course, adjusting  itself. Nearby some space debris rushed past, incinerating in the  blasts of the turbine jets.    \"So far so good,\" Gross said.    They began to breathe more easily. The invisible pilot had taken  control smoothly, calmly. The ship was in good hands. Kramer spoke a  few more words into the microphone, and they swung again. Now they  were moving back the way they had come, toward the moon.    \"Let's see what he does when we enter the moon's pull,\" Kramer said.  \"He was a good mathematician, the old man. He could handle any kind of  problem.\"    The ship veered, turning away from the moon. The great eaten-away  globe fell behind them.    Gross breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's that.\"    \"One more thing.\" Kramer picked up the microphone. \"Return to the moon  and land the ship at the first space field,\" he said into it.    \"Good Lord,\" Winter murmured. \"Why are you--\"    \"Be quiet.\" Kramer stood, listening. The turbines gasped and roared as  the ship swung full around, gaining speed. They were moving back, back  toward the moon again. The ship dipped down, heading toward the great  globe below.    \"We're going a little fast,\" the Pilot said. \"I don't see how he can  put down at this velocity.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The port filled up, as the globe swelled rapidly. The Pilot hurried  toward the board, reaching for the controls. All at once the ship  jerked. The nose lifted and the ship shot out into space, away from  the moon, turning at an oblique angle. The men were thrown to the  floor by the sudden change in course. They got to their feet again,  speechless, staring at each other.    The Pilot gazed down at the board. \"It wasn't me! I didn't touch a  thing. I didn't even get to it.\"    The ship was gaining speed each moment. Kramer hesitated. \"Maybe you  better switch it back to manual.\"    The Pilot closed the switch. He took hold of the steering controls and  moved them experimentally. \"Nothing.\" He turned around. \"Nothing. It  doesn't respond.\"    No one spoke.    \"You can see what has happened,\" Kramer said calmly. \"The old man  won't let go of it, now that he has it. I was afraid of this when I  saw the wiring changes. Everything in this ship is centrally  controlled, even the cooling system, the hatches, the garbage release.  We're helpless.\"    \"Nonsense.\" Gross strode to the board. He took hold of the wheel and  turned it. The ship continued on its course, moving away from the  moon, leaving it behind.    \"Release!\" Kramer said into the microphone. \"Let go of the controls!  We'll take it back. Release.\"    \"No good,\" the Pilot said. \"Nothing.\" He spun the useless wheel. \"It's  dead, completely dead.\"    \"And we're still heading out,\" Winter said, grinning foolishly. \"We'll  be going through the first-line defense belt in a few minutes. If they  don't shoot us down--\"    \"We better radio back.\" The Pilot clicked the radio to _send_. \"I'll  contact the main bases, one of the observation stations.\"    \"Better get the defense belt, at the speed we're going. We'll be into  it in a minute.\"    \"And after that,\" Kramer said, \"we'll be in outer space. He's moving  us toward outspace velocity. Is this ship equipped with baths?\"    \"Baths?\" Gross said.    \"The sleep tanks. For space-drive. We may need them if we go much  faster.\"    \"But good God, where are we going?\" Gross said. \"Where--where's he  taking us?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Pilot obtained contact. \"This is Dwight, on ship,\" he said. \"We're  entering the defense zone at high velocity. Don't fire on us.\"    \"Turn back,\" the impersonal voice came through the speaker. \"You're  not allowed in the defense zone.\"    \"We can't. We've lost control.\"    \"Lost control?\"    \"This is an experimental ship.\"    Gross took the radio. \"This is Commander Gross, Security. We're being  carried into outer space. There's nothing we can do. Is there any way  that we can be removed from this ship?\"    A hesitation. \"We have some fast pursuit ships that could pick you up  if you wanted to jump. The chances are good they'd find you. Do you  have space flares?\"    \"We do,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's try it.\"    \"Abandon ship?\" Kramer said. \"If we leave now we'll never see it  again.\"    \"What else can we do? We're gaining speed all the time. Do you propose  that we stay here?\"    \"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"Damn it, there ought to be a better  solution.\"    \"Could you contact _him_?\" Winter asked. \"The Old Man? Try to reason  with him?"]]]
