Little by little, the signs of brute nature are  subordinated, or disappear; and at last, Robetta, a humble Italian  engraver of the fifteenth century, entering into the Greek fancy  because it belongs to all ages, has expressed it in its most  exquisite form, in a design of Ceres and her children, of whom their  mother is no longer afraid, as in the Homeric hymn to Pan.  The puck-  noses have grown delicate, so that, with Plato's infatuated lover,  you may call them winsome, if you please; and no one would wish those  hairy little shanks away, with which one of the small Pans walks at  her side, grasping her skirt stoutly; while the other, the sick or  weary one, rides in the arms of Ceres herself, who in graceful  Italian dress, and decked airily with fruit and corn, steps across a  country of cut sheaves, pressing it closely to her, with a child's  peevish trouble in its face, and its small goat-legs and tiny hoofs  folded over together, precisely after the manner of a little child.    There is one element in the conception of Dionysus, which his  connexion with the satyrs, Marsyas being one of them, and with Pan,  from whom the flute passed to all the shepherds of Theocritus, alike  illustrates, his interest, namely, in one of the great species of  music.  One form of that wilder vegetation, of which the Satyr race  is the soul made visible, is the reed, which [18] the creature plucks  and trims into musical pipes.  And as Apollo inspires and rules over  all the music of strings, so Dionysus inspires and rules over all the  music of the reed, the water-plant, in which the ideas of water and  of vegetable life are brought close together, natural property,  therefore, of the spirit of life in the green sap.  I said that the  religion of Dionysus was, for those who lived in it, a complete  religion, a complete sacred representation and interpretation of the  whole of life; and as, in his relation to the vine, he fills for them  the place of Demeter, is the life of the earth through the grape as  she through the grain, so, in this other phase of his being, in his  relation to the reed, he fills for them the place of Apollo; he is  the inherent cause of music and poetry; he inspires; he explains the  phenomena of enthusiasm, as distinguished by Plato in the Phaedrus,  the secrets of possession by a higher and more energetic spirit than  one's own, the gift of self-revelation, of passing out of oneself  through words, tones, gestures.  A winged Dionysus, venerated at  Amyclae, was perhaps meant to represent him thus, as the god of  enthusiasm, of the rising up on those spiritual wings, of which also  we hear something in the Phaedrus of Plato.    The artists of the Renaissance occupied themselves much with the  person and the story of Dionysus; and Michelangelo, in a work still  remaining in Florence, in which he essayed [19] with success to  produce a thing which should pass with the critics for a piece of  ancient sculpture, has represented him in the fulness, as it seems,  of this enthusiasm, an image of delighted, entire surrender to  transporting dreams.  And this is no subtle after-thought of a later  age, but true to certain finer movements of old Greek sentiment,  though it may seem to have waited for the hand of Michelangelo before  it attained complete realisation.  The head of Ion leans, as they  recline at the banquet, on the shoulder of Charmides; he mutters in  his sleep of things seen therein, but awakes as the flute-players  enter, whom Charmides has hired for his birthday supper.  The soul of  Callias, who sits on the other side of Charmides, flashes out; he  counterfeits, with life-like gesture, the personal tricks of friend  or foe; or the things he could never utter before, he finds words for  now; the secrets of life are on his lips.  It is in this loosening of  the lips and heart, strictly, that Dionysus is the Deliverer,  Eleutherios; and of such enthusiasm, or ecstasy, is, in a certain  sense, an older patron than Apollo himself.  Even at Delphi, the  centre of Greek inspiration and of the religion of Apollo, his claim  always maintained itself; and signs are not wanting that Apollo was  but a later comer there.  There, under his later reign, hard by the  golden image of Apollo himself, near the sacred tripod on which the  Pythia sat to prophesy, was to be seen a strange object--a sort [20]  of coffin or cinerary urn with the inscription, \"Here lieth the body  of Dionysus, the son of Semele.\"  The pediment of the great temple  was divided between them--Apollo with the nine Muses on that side,  Dionysus, with perhaps three times three Graces, on this.  A third of  the whole year was held sacred to him; the four winter months were  the months of Dionysus; and in the shrine of Apollo itself he was  worshipped with almost equal devotion.    The religion of Dionysus takes us back, then, into that old Greek  life of the vineyards, as we see it on many painted vases, with much  there as we should find it now, as we see it in Bennozzo Gozzoli's  mediaeval fresco of the Invention of Wine in the Campo Santo at Pisa-  -the family of Noah presented among all the circumstances of a Tuscan  vineyard, around the press from which the first wine is flowing, a  painted idyll, with its vintage colours still opulent in decay, and  not without its solemn touch of biblical symbolism.  For differences,  we detect in that primitive life, and under that Greek sky, a nimbler  play of fancy, lightly and unsuspiciously investing all things with  personal aspect and incident, and a certain mystical apprehension,  now almost departed, of unseen powers beyond the material veil of  things, corresponding to the exceptional vigour and variety of the  Greek organisation.  This peasant life lies, in unhistoric time,  behind the definite forms with which poetry and a refined [21]  priesthood afterwards clothed the religion of Dionysus; and the mere  scenery and circumstances of the vineyard have determined many things  in its development.  The noise of the vineyard still sounds in some  of his epithets, perhaps in his best-known name--Iacchus, Bacchus.  The masks suspended on base or cornice, so familiar an ornament in  later Greek architecture, are the little faces hanging from the  vines, and moving in the wind, to scare the birds.  That garland of  ivy, the aesthetic value of which is so great in the later imagery of  Dionysus and his descendants, the leaves of which, floating from his  hair, become so noble in the hands of Titian and Tintoret, was  actually worn on the head for coolness; his earliest and most sacred  images were wrought in the wood of the vine.  The people of the  vineyard had their feast, the little or country Dionysia, which still  lived on, side by side with the greater ceremonies of a later time,  celebrated in December, the time of the storing of the new wine.  It  was then that the potters' fair came, calpis and amphora, together  with lamps against the winter, laid out in order for the choice of  buyers; for Keramus, the Greek Vase, is a son of Dionysus, of wine  and of Athene, who teaches men all serviceable and decorative art.  Then the goat was killed, and its blood poured out at the root of the  vines; and Dionysus literally drank the blood of goats; and, being  Greeks, with quick and mobile sympathies, [22] deisidaimones,+  \"superstitious,\" or rather \"susceptible of religious impressions,\"  some among them, remembering those departed since last year, add yet  a little more, and a little wine and water for the dead also;  brooding how the sense of these things might pass below the roots, to  spirits hungry and thirsty, perhaps, in their shadowy homes.  But the  gaiety, that gaiety which Aristophanes in the Acharnians has depicted  with so many vivid touches, as a thing of which civil war had  deprived the villages of Attica, preponderates over the grave.  The  travelling country show comes round with its puppets; even the slaves  have their holiday;* the mirth becomes excessive; they hide their  faces under grotesque masks of bark, or stain them with wine-lees, or  potters' crimson even, like the old rude idols painted red; and carry  in midnight procession such rough symbols of the productive force of  nature as the women and children had best not look upon; which will  be frowned upon, and refine themselves, or disappear, in the feasts  of cultivated Athens.    Of the whole story of Dionysus, it was the episode of his marriage  with Ariadne about which ancient art concerned itself oftenest, and  with most effect.  Here, although the antiquarian [23] may still  detect circumstances which link the persons and incidents of the  legend with the mystical life of the earth, as symbols of its annual  change, yet the merely human interest of the story has prevailed over  its earlier significance; the spiritual form of fire and dew has  become a romantic lover.  And as a story of romantic love, fullest  perhaps of all the motives of classic legend of the pride of life, it  survived with undiminished interest to a later world, two of the  greatest masters of Italian painting having poured their whole power  into it; Titian with greater space of ingathered shore and mountain,  and solemn foliage, and fiery animal life; Tintoret with profounder  luxury of delight in the nearness to each other, and imminent  embrace, of glorious bodily presences; and both alike with consummate  beauty of physical form.  Hardly less humanised is the Theban legend  of Dionysus, the legend of his birth from Semele, which, out of the  entire body of tradition concerning him, was accepted as central by  the Athenian imagination.  For the people of Attica, he comes from  Boeotia, a country of northern marsh and mist, but from whose sombre,  black marble towns came also the vine, the musical reed cut from its  sedges, and the worship of the Graces, always so closely connected  with the religion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4042"],[0,"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as Revealed in His Own Words (#3)"],[1,"toward the pianoforte at the time. His love for Aloysia  Weber occupied the most of his attention and time.)    18. \"Herewith I am sending you a Prelude and a three-voiced Fugue  (Kochel, No. 394)....It is awkwardly written; the prelude must  come first and the fugue follow. The reason for its appearance is  because I had made the fugue and wrote it out while I was  thinking out the prelude.\"    (Vienna, April 20, 1782, to his sister Marianne. Here Mozart  gives us evidence of his manner of composing; he worked out his  compositions completely in his mind and was then able, even after  considerable time had elapsed, to write them down, in which  proceeding nothing could disturb him. In the case before us while  engaged in the more or less mechanical labor of transcription he  thought out a new composition. Concerning the fugue and its  origin he continues to gossip in the same letter.)    19. \"The cause of this fugue seeing the light of this world is my  dear Constanze. Baron von Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, let  me carry home all the works of Handel and Sebastian Bach after I  had played them through for him. Constanze fell in love with the  fugues as soon as she had heard them; she doesn't want to hear  anything but fugues, especially those of Handel and Bach. Having  often heard me improvise fugues she asked me if I had never  written any down, and when I said no, she gave me a good  scolding, for not being willing to write the most beautiful  things in music, and did not cease her begging until I had  composed one for her, and so it came about. I purposely wrote the  indication 'Andante maestoso,' so that it should not be played  too rapidly;--for unless a fugue is played slowly the entrance of  the subject will not be distinctly and clearly heard and the  piece will be ineffective. As soon as I find time and opportunity  I shall write five more.\"    (Vienna, April 20, 1782, to his sister Marianne. Cf. No. 93.  [Mozart's remark that he carried home \"all the works\" of Handel  and Bach, must, of course, be read as meaning all that were in  print at the time. H.E.K.])    20. \"I have no small amount of work ahead of me. By Sunday week I  must have my opera arranged for military band or somebody will be  ahead of me and carry away the profits; and I must also write a  new symphony. How will that be possible? You have no idea how  difficult it is to make such an arrangement so that it shall be  adapted to wind instruments and yet lose nothing of its effect.  Well, well;--I shall have to do the work at night.\"    (Vienna, July 20, 1782, to his father who had asked for a  symphony for the Hafner family in Salzburg. The opera referred  to is \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.\")    21. \"I was firmly resolved to write the Adagio for the clock-maker  at once so that I might drop a few ducats into the hands of my  dear little wife; and I began it, but was unlucky enough--because  I hate such work--not to be able to finish it. I write at it every  day, but have to drop it because it bores me. If the reason for its  existence were not such a momentous one, rest assured I should let  the thing drop. I hope, however, to force it through in time. Ah,  yes! if it were a large clock-work with a sound like an organ I'd  be glad to do it; but as it is the thing is made up of tiny pipes  only, which sound too shrill and childish for me.\"    (Frankfort-on-the-Main, October 3, 1790, to his wife. \"A Piece  for an Organ in a Clock.\" [Kochel's catalogue, No. 594.] It was  probably ordered by Count Deym for his Wax-works Museum on the  occasion of the death of the famous Field Marshal Laudon. The  dominant mood of sorrow prevails in the first movement; the  Allegro is in Handel's style.)        CONCERNING THE OPERA        When he was twenty-two years old Mozart wrote to his father,  \"I am strongly filled with the desire to write an opera.\" Often  does he speak of this ambition. It was, in fact, his true and  individual field as the symphony was that of Beethoven. He took  counsel with his father by letter touching many details in his  earlier operas, wherefore we are advised about their origin, and,  what is more to the purpose, about Mozart's fine aesthetic  judgment. His four operatic masterpieces are imperishable, and a  few words about them are in place, particularly since Mozart has  left numerous and interesting comments on \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem  Serail.\" This first German opera he composed with the confessed  purpose of substituting a work designed for the \"national lyric  stage\" for the conventional and customary Italian opera. Despite  its Hispano-Turkish color, the work is so ingenuous, so German in  feeling, and above all so full of German humor that the success  was unexampled, and Mozart could write to his father: \"The people  are daft over my opera.\" Here, at the very outset, Mozart's  humor, the golden one of all the gifts with which Mother Nature  had endowed him, was called into play. With this work German  comic opera took its beginning. As has been remarked \"although it  has been imitated, it has never been surpassed in its musically  comic effects.\" The delightfully Falstaffian figure of Osmin,  most ingeniously characterized in the music, will create  merriment for all time, and the opera acquires a new, personal  and peculiarly amiable charm from the fact that we are privileged  to see in the love-joy of \"Belmont\" and \"Constanze\" an image of  that of the young composer and his \"Stanzerl.\"    After \"Die Entfuhrung\" (1782) came \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" (1786),  \"Don Giovanni\" (1787), and \"Die Zauberflote\" (1791). It would be  a vain task to attempt to establish any internal relationship  between these works. Mozart was not like Wagner, a strong  personality capable of devoting a full sum of vital force to the  carrying out of a chosen and approved principle. As is generally  the case with geniuses, he was a child; a child led by momentary  conditions; moreover, a child of the rococo period. There is,  therefore, no cause of wonderment in the fact that Italian texts  are again used in \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni,\" and  that another, but this time a complete German opera, does not  appear until we reach \"Die Zauberflote.\"    Nevertheless it is possible to note a development towards a  climax in the four operas respecting Mozart's conception of the  world. It has been denied that there is a single red thread in  Mozart's life-work. Nevertheless our method of study will  disclose to us an ever-growing view of human lift, and a deeper  and deeper glimpse into the emotional and intellectual life of  man, his aims and destiny. From the almost commonplace conditions  of \"Die Entfuhrung,\" where a rascal sings in the best of humor  of first beheading and then hanging a man, we reach a plane in  \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" in which despite the refinement and  mitigation of Beaumarchais's indictment we feel the revolutionary  breeze freshly blowing. In \"Don Giovanni\" we see the individual  set up in opposition to God and the world, in order that he  fulfill his destiny, or live out his life, as the popular phrase  goes today. Here the tremendous tragedy which lies in the story  has received a musical expression quite without parallel,  notwithstanding the moderation exercised in the employment of  means. In \"Die Zauberflote,\" finally, we observe the  clarification which follows the fermentation. Here we breathe the  pure, clear atmosphere of heaven, the atmosphere within which he  can live who has freed himself from selfish desire, thus gaining  internal peace, and who recognizes his ego only in the happiness  and welfare of others.        22. \"I have an unspeakable desire to compose another opera....In  Italy one can acquire more honor and credit with an opera than  with a hundred concerts in Germany, and I am the happier because  I can compose, which, after all, is my one joy and passion....I  am beside myself as soon as I hear anybody talk about an opera,  sit in a theatre or hear singing.\"    (Munich, October 11, 1777, to his father, reporting an  expectation of making a position for himself in Italy.)    23. \"I beg of you do your best that we may go to Italy. You know  my greatest longing--to write operas....Do not forget my wish to  write operas! I am envious of every man who composes one; I could  almost weep from chagrin whenever I hear or see an aria. But  Italian, not German; seria not buffa.\"    (Mannheim, February 2, 1778, to his father. Mozart wanted to go  with the Weber family (he was in love with Aloysia, his future  sister-in-law) to Italy while his father was desirous that he  should go to Paris.)    24. \"I am strongly possessed by the desire to write an opera--  French rather than German, but Italian rather than either German  or French. Wendling's associates are all of the opinion that my  compositions would please extraordinarily in Paris. One thing is  certain; I would not fear the test. As you know I am able to  assimilate and imitate pretty much all styles of composition.\"    (Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father. Wendling was a  flautist in Mannheim.)    25. \"I assure you that if I get a commission to compose an opera  I shall not be frightened. True the (French) language is of the  devil's own making, and I fully appreciate all the difficulties  that composers have encountered; but I feel myself as capable of  overcoming them as any other composer. Au contraire when I  convince myself that all is well with my opera, I feel as if my  body were afire--my hands and feet tremble with desire to make  the Frenchman value and fear the German. Why is no Frenchman ever  commissioned to write a grand opera? Why must it always be a  foreigner? In my case the most unendurable thing would be the  singers. Well, I'm ready. I shall begin no dickerings, but if I  am challenged I shall know how to defend myself. But I should  prefer to get along without a duel; I do not like to fight with  dwarfs."]]]
