[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3426"],[0,"On Books and the Housing of Them (#3)"],[1," for those who from necessity or choice  consider it at all, is a very serious one. It has been a fashion to make  bookcases highly ornamental. Now books want for and in themselves no  ornament at all. They are themselves the ornament. Just as shops need no  ornament, and no one will think of or care for any structural ornament,  if the goods are tastefully disposed in the shop-window. The man who  looks for society in his books will readily perceive that, in proportion  as the face of his bookcase is occupied by ornament, he loses that  society; and conversely, the more that face approximates to a sheet of  bookbacks, the more of that society he will enjoy. And so it is that  three great advantages come hand in hand, and, as will be seen, reach  their maximum together: the sociability of books, minimum of cost in  providing for them, and ease of access to them.    In order to attain these advantages, two conditions are fundamental.  First, the shelves must, as a rule, be fixed; secondly, the cases, or a  large part of them, should have their side against the wall, and thus,  projecting into the room for a convenient distance, they should be of  twice the depth needed for a single line of books, and should hold two  lines, one facing each way. Twelve inches is a fair and liberal depth  for two rows of octavos. The books are thus thrown into stalls, but  stalls after the manner of a stable, or of an old-fashioned coffee-room;  not after the manner of a bookstall, which, as times go, is no stall  at all, but simply a flat space made by putting some scraps of boarding  together, and covering them with books.    This method of dividing the longitudinal space by projections at right  angles to it, if not very frequently used, has long been known. A great  example of it is to be found in the noble library of Trinity College,  Cambridge, and is the work of Sir Christopher Wren. He has kept these  cases down to very moderate height, for he doubtless took into account  that great heights require long ladders, and that the fetching and use  of these greatly add to the time consumed in getting or in replacing a  book. On the other hand, the upper spaces of the walls are sacrificed,  whereas in Dublin, All Souls, and many other libraries the bookcases  ascend very high, and magnificent apartments walled with books may in  this way be constructed. Access may be had to the upper portions by  galleries; but we cannot have stairs all round the room, and even with  one gallery of books a room should not be more than from sixteen to  eighteen feet high if we are to act on the principle of bringing the  largest possible number of volumes into the smallest possible space. I  am afraid it must be admitted that we cannot have a noble and imposing  spectacle, in a vast apartment, without sacrificing economy and  accessibility; and vice versa.    The projections should each have attached to them what I rudely term an  endpiece (for want of a better name), that is, a shallow and extremely  light adhering bookcase (light by reason of the shortness of the  shelves), which both increases the accommodation, and makes one short  side as well as the two long ones of the parallelopiped to present  simply a face of books with the lines of shelf, like threads, running  between the rows.    The wall-spaces between the projections ought also to be turned to  account for shallow bookcases, so far as they are not occupied by  windows. If the width of the interval be two feet six, about sixteen  inches of this may be given to shallow cases placed against the wall.    Economy of space is in my view best attained by fixed shelves. This  dictum I will now endeavor to make good. If the shelves are movable,  each shelf imposes a dead weight on the structure of the bookcase,  without doing anything to support it. Hence it must be built with wood  of considerable mass, and the more considerable the mass of wood the  greater are both the space occupied and the ornament needed. When the  shelf is fixed, it contributes as a fastening to hold the parts of the  bookcase together; and a very long experience enables me to say that  shelves of from half- to three-quarters of an inch worked fast into  uprights of from three-quarters to a full inch will amply suffice for  all sizes of books except large and heavy folios, which would probably  require a small, and only a small, addition of thickness.    I have recommended that as a rule the shelves be fixed, and have given  reasons for the adoption of such a rule. I do not know whether it will  receive the sanction of authorities. And I make two admissions. First,  it requires that each person owning and arranging a library should have  a pretty accurate general knowledge of the sizes of his books. Secondly,  it may be expedient to introduce here and there, by way of exception,  a single movable shelf; and this, I believe, will be found to afford a  margin sufficient to meet occasional imperfections in the computation of  sizes. Subject to these remarks, I have considerable confidence in the  recommendation I have made.    I will now exhibit to my reader the practical effect of such  arrangement, in bringing great numbers of books within easy reach. Let  each projection be three feet long, twelve inches deep (ample for two  faces of octavos), and nine feet high, so that the upper shelf can be  reached by the aid of a wooden stool of two steps not more than twenty  inches high, and portable without the least effort in a single hand.  I will suppose the wall space available to be eight feet, and the  projections, three in number, with end pieces need only jut out three  feet five, while narrow strips of bookcase will run up the wall between  the projections. Under these conditions, the bookcases thus described  will carry above 2,000 octavo volumes.    And a library forty feet long and twenty feet broad, amply lighted,  having some portion of the centre fitted with very low bookcases suited  to serve for some of the uses of tables, will receive on the floor from  18,000 to 20,000 volumes of all sizes, without losing the appearance of  a room or assuming that of a warehouse, and while leaving portions of  space available near the windows for purposes of study. If a gallery  be added, there will be accommodation for a further number of five  thousand, and the room need be no more than sixteen feet high. But a  gallery is not suitable for works above the octavo size, on account of  inconvenience in carriage to and fro.    It has been admitted that in order to secure the vital purpose of  compression with fixed shelving, the rule of arrangement according  to subjects must be traversed partially by division into sizes. This  division, however, need not, as to the bulk of the library, be more than  threefold. The main part would be for octavos. This is becoming more and  more the classical or normal size; so that nowadays the octavo edition  is professionally called the library edition. Then there should be  deeper cases for quarto and folio, and shallower for books below octavo,  each appropriately divided into shelves.    If the economy of time by compression is great, so is the economy of  cost. I think it reasonable to take the charge of provision for books in  a gentleman's house, and in the ordinary manner, at a shilling a volume.  This may vary either way, but it moderately represents, I think, my  own experience, in London residences, of the charge of fitting up with  bookcases, which, if of any considerable size, are often unsuitable for  removal. The cost of the method which I have adopted later in life, and  have here endeavored to explain, need not exceed one penny per volume.  Each bookcase when filled represents, unless in exceptional cases,  nearly a solid mass. The intervals are so small that, as a rule, they  admit a very small portion of dust. If they are at a tolerable distance  from the fireplace, if carpeting be avoided except as to small movable  carpets easily removed for beating, and if sweeping be discreetly  conducted, dust may, at any rate in the country, be made to approach to  a quantite negligeable.    It is a great matter, in addition to other advantages, to avoid the  endless trouble and the miscarriages of movable shelves; the looseness,  and the tightness, the weary arms, the aching fingers, and the broken  fingernails. But it will be fairly asked what is to be done, when the  shelves are fixed, with volumes too large to go into them? I admit that  the dilemma, when it occurs, is formidable. I admit also that no book  ought to be squeezed or even coaxed into its place: they should  move easily both in and out. And I repeat here that the plan I have  recommended requires a pretty exact knowledge by measurement of the  sizes of books and the proportions in which the several sizes will  demand accommodation. The shelf-spacing must be reckoned beforehand,  with a good deal of care and no little time. But I can say from  experience that by moderate care and use this knowledge can be attained,  and that the resulting difficulties, when measured against the aggregate  of convenience, are really insignificant. It will be noticed that my  remarks are on minute details, and that they savor more of serious  handiwork in the placing of books than of lordly survey and direction.  But what man who really loves his books delegates to any other human  being, as long as there is breath in his body, the office of inducting  them into their homes?    And now as to results. It is something to say that in this way 10,000  volumes can be placed within a room of quite ordinary size, all visible,  all within easy reach, and without destroying the character of the  apartment as a room. But, on the strength of a case with which I am  acquainted, I will even be a little more particular. I take as before a  room of forty feet in length and twenty in breadth, thoroughly lighted  by four windows on each side; as high"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34294"],[0,"Birds Illustrated (#3)"],[1," especially at the pairing  season. With what odd gestures will a smartly dressed Cock sparrow, for  instance, endeavor to cut a good figure in the eyes of his demure and  sober-tinted lady-love!    To a similar performance, though with more of dignity and action about  it, the Blackcock treats his wives, for, unlike the better conducted  though often much calumniated sparrow, he is not satisfied with a single  mate. One of the most characteristic of spring sounds on Exmoor, as  evening darkens, or, still more, in the early hours of the morning, is  the challenge of the Blackcock. In the month of April he who is abroad  early enough may watch, upon the russet slopes of Dunkery, a little  party of Blackcock at one of their recognized and probably ancestral  meeting-places, by one of the little moorland streams, or on the wet  edge of some swampy hollow. Each bird crouches on a hillock, in the  oddest of attitudes--its head down, its wings a-droop, its beautiful  tail raised--and utters at intervals strange, almost weird notes,  sometimes suggestive of the purr of a Turtle-dove, and sometimes more  like the cry of chamois.    Presently an old cock, grand in his new black coat, will get up and  march backward and forward with his neck stretched out and his wings  trailing on the ground. Now he leaps into the air, sometimes turning  right round before he alights, and now again he crouches close upon his  hillock. It is said that in places where black game are few a single  cock will go through all this by himself, or at least with only his  wives for witnesses. But if there are more cocks than one, the  proceedings generally end with a fight. Where the birds are numerous the  young cocks, who are not allowed to enter the arena with their elders,  hold unauthorized celebrations of their own.    There are many birds which thus, like higher mortals, have their fits  of madness in the days of courtship. But there are some, such as the  spur-winged Lapwing of La Plata, which are, like the lady in the song,  so fond of dancing, especially of what the natives call their serious  dance, meaning a square one, that they indulge in such performances all  the year, not in the daytime only, but even on moonlight nights. \"If,\"  says Mr. Hudson, who tells the story, \"a person watches any two birds  for some time--for they live in pairs--he will see another Lapwing, one  of a neighboring couple, rise up and fly to them, leaving his own mate  to guard their chosen ground, and instead of resenting this visit as an  unwarranted intrusion on their domain, as they would certainly resent  the approach of almost any other bird, they welcome it with notes and  signs of pleasure. Advancing to the visitor, they place themselves  behind it; then all three keeping step, begin a rapid march, uttering  resonant drumming notes in time with their movements; the notes of the  pair behind them being emitted in a stream, like a drum roll, while the  leader utters loud single notes at regular intervals. The march ceases;  the leader elevates his wings and stands motionless and erect, still  uttering loud notes, while the other two with puffed-out plumage, and  standing exactly abreast, stoop forward and downward until the top of  their beaks touch the ground, and, sinking their rhythmical voices to a  murmur, remain for some time in this posture. The performance is then  over and the visitor goes back to his own ground and mate, to receive a  visitor himself later on.\"--_London Daily News._           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  PURPLE FINCH.                  Copyright by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1898, Chicago.]    THE PURPLE FINCH.        \"The wind blows cold, the birds are still,             And skies are gray.\"      Purple Grosbeak, Crimson Finch, Strawberry Bird, and Linnet are some of  the common names by which this bird of bright colors, sweet song, and  sociable disposition is known. It is very numerous in New England, but  is found nesting regularly in the northern tier of states, North and  South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, etc., northward, and it is  said to breed in northern Illinois. In Nova Scotia it is exceeding  abundant.    Robert Ridgway says he first made the acquaintance of the Purple Finch  at Mt. Carmel, in mid-winter, \"under circumstances of delightful memory.  The ground was covered with snow,--the weather clear and bright, but  cold. Crossing a field in the outskirts of the town, and approaching the  line of tall, dead rag-weeds which grew thickly in the fence corners, a  straggling flock of birds was startled, flew a short distance, and again  alighted on the tall weed-stalks, uttering as they flew, a musical,  metallic _chink, chink_. The beautiful crimson color of the adult males,  heightened by contrast with the snow, was a great surprise to the  writer, then a boy of thirteen, and excited intense interest in this, to  him, new bird. On subsequent occasions during the same winter, they were  found under like circumstances, and also in 'sycamore' or buttonwood  trees, feeding on the small seeds contained within the balls of this  tree.\"    Dr. Brewer says that the song of the Purple Finch resembles that of the  Canary, and though less varied and powerful, is softer, sweeter, and  more touching and pleasing. The notes may be heard from the last of May  until late in September, and in the long summer evening are often  continued until it is quite dark. Their song has all the beauty and  pathos of the Warbling Vireo, and greatly resembles it, but is more  powerful and full in tone. It is a very interesting sight to watch one  of these little performers in the midst of his song. He appears  perfectly absorbed in his work,--his form is dilated, his crest is  erected, his throat expands, and he seems to be utterly unconscious of  all around him. But let an intruder of his own race appear within a few  feet of the singer, the song instantly ceases, and in a violent fit of  indignation, he chases him away. S. P. Cheney says that a careful  observer told him that he had seen the Linnet fly from the side of his  mate directly upward fifteen or twenty feet, singing every instant in  the most excited manner till he dropped to the point of starting. The  Yellow-breasted Chat has a like performance. See Vol. II of BIRDS, p.238.    The nest of the Finch is usually placed in evergreens or orchard trees,  at a moderate distance from the ground. It is composed of weed-stalks,  bark strips, rootlets, grasses, and vegetable fibres, and lined with  hair. The eggs are four or five in number, dull green, and spotted with  dark brown.    Study his picture and habits and be prepared to welcome this charming  spring visitant.          THE RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER.        A little Woodpecker am I,        And you may always know      When I am searching for a worm,        For tap, tap, tap, I go.      Oh yes, I am proud of my appearance, but really I am not proud of my  name. Sometimes I am called the \"Zebra Bird,\" on account of the bands of  white and black on my back and wings. That is a much prettier name, I  think, than the Red-bellied Woodpecker, don't you? Certainly it is more  genteel.    I know a bird that is called the Red-eyed Vireo, because his eyes are  red. Well, my eyes are red, too. Then why not call me the Red-eyed  Woodpecker? Still the Woodpeckers are such a common family I don't much  care about that either.    In the last February number of BIRDS that saucy red-headed cousin of  mine had his picture and a letter. Before very long the Red-cockaded  Woodpecker will have his picture taken too, I suppose.    Dear, dear! If all the Woodpeckers are going to write to you, you will  have a merry time. Why, I can count twenty-four different species of  that family and I have only four fingers, or toes, to count on, and you  little folks have five. There may be more of them, Woodpeckers I mean,  for all I know.    Speaking about toes! I have two in front and two behind. There are some  Woodpeckers that have only three, two in front and one behind. It's a  fact, I assure you. I thought I would tell you about it before one of  the three toed fellows got a chance to write to you about it himself.    I am not so shy and wary a bird as some people think I am. When I want  an insect, or worm, I don't care how many eyes are watching me, but  up the tree I climb in my zigzag fashion, crying _chaw-chaw_, or  _chow-chow_ in a noisy sort of way. Sometimes I say _chuck, chuck,  chuck_! The first is Chinese, and the last English, you know. You might  think it sounded like the bark of a small dog, though.    I am fond of flies and catch them on the wing. I like ripe apples, too;  and oh, what a _good_ time I have in winter raiding the farmer's corn  crib! I have only to hammer at the logs with my sharp bill, and soon I  can squeeze myself in between them and eat my fill. I understand the  farmer doesn't like it very much.

Co., 1898, Chicago.]    THE RED BELLIED WOODPECKER.      \"Zebra Bird\" is the name by which this handsome Woodpecker will be  recognized by many readers. Some regard it as the most beautiful of the  smaller species of its tribe. As may be seen, the whole crown and nape  are scarlet in the male. In the female they are only partly so, but  sufficiently to make the identification easy. A bird generally of  retired habits, seeking the deepest and most unfrequented forests to  breed, it is nevertheless often found in numbers in the vicinity of  villages where there are a few dead and partially decayed trees, in  which they drill their holes, high up on a limb, or in the bole of the  tree. When engaged in hammering for insects it frequently utters a  short, singular note, which Wilson likens to the bark of a small dog. We"]]]
