My mother was there, too, and I had gone back with her.  The  man came back and said:    \"Mrs. Martindale, sir, wishes to know, with her respectful service, if  she may have a word with you.\"  Before father could reply mother told him  to bring her.  The housekeeper could not have been far off--that kind are  generally near a keyhole--for she came at once.  When she came in, she  stood at the door curtseying and looking pale.  Father said:    \"Well?\"    \"I thought, sir and ma'am, that I had better come and tell you about  Master Sent Leger.  I would have come at once, but I feared to disturb  you.\"    \"Well?\"  Father had a stern way with servants.  When I'm head of the  family I'll tread them under my feet.  That's the way to get real  devotion from servants!    \"If you please, sir, I took the young gentleman into my room and ordered  a nice breakfast for him, for I could see he was half famished--a growing  boy like him, and so tall!  Presently it came along.  It was a good  breakfast, too!  The very smell of it made even me hungry.  There were  eggs and frizzled ham, and grilled kidneys, and coffee, and buttered  toast, and bloater-paste--\"    \"That will do as to the menu,\" said mother.  \"Go on!\"    \"When it was all ready, and the maid had gone, I put a chair to the table  and said, 'Now, sir, your breakfast is ready!'  He stood up and said,  'Thank you, madam; you are very kind!' and he bowed to me quite nicely,  just as if I was a lady, ma'am!\"    \"Go on,\" said mother.    \"Then, sir, he held out his hand and said, 'Good-bye, and thank you,' and  he took up his cap.    \"'But aren't you going to have any breakfast, sir?' I says.    \"'No, thank you, madam,' he said; 'I couldn't eat here . . . in this  house, I mean!'  Well, ma'am, he looked so lonely that I felt my heart  melting, and I ventured to ask him if there was any mortal thing I could  do for him.  'Do tell me, dear,' I ventured to say.  'I am an old woman,  and you, sir, are only a boy, though it's a fine man you will be--like  your dear, splendid father, which I remember so well, and gentle like  your poor dear mother.'    \"'You're a dear!' he says; and with that I took up his hand and kissed  it, for I remember his poor dear mother so well, that was dead only a  year.  Well, with that he turned his head away, and when I took him by  the shoulders and turned him round--he is only a young boy, ma'am, for  all he is so big--I saw that the tears were rolling down his cheeks.  With that I laid his head on my breast--I've had children of my own,  ma'am, as you know, though they're all gone.  He came willing enough, and  sobbed for a little bit.  Then he straightened himself up, and I stood  respectfully beside him.    \"'Tell Mr. Melton,' he said, 'that I shall not trouble him about the  trustee business.'    \"'But won't you tell him yourself, sir, when you see him?' I says.    \"'I shall not see him again,' he says; 'I am going back now!'    \"Well, ma'am, I knew he'd had no breakfast, though he was hungry, and  that he would walk as he come, so I ventured to say: 'If you won't take  it a liberty, sir, may I do anything to make your going easier?  Have you  sufficient money, sir?  If not, may I give, or lend, you some?  I shall  be very proud if you will allow me to.'    \"'Yes,' he says quite hearty.  'If you will, you might lend me a  shilling, as I have no money.  I shall not forget it.'  He said, as he  took the coin: 'I shall return the amount, though I never can the  kindness.  I shall keep the coin.'  He took the shilling, sir--he  wouldn't take any more--and then he said good-bye.  At the door he turned  and walked back to me, and put his arms round me like a real boy does,  and gave me a hug, and says he:    \"'Thank you a thousand times, Mrs. Martindale, for your goodness to me,  for your sympathy, and for the way you have spoken of my father and  mother.  You have seen me cry, Mrs. Martindale,' he said; 'I don't often  cry: the last time was when I came back to the lonely house after my poor  dear was laid to rest.  But you nor any other shall ever see a tear of  mine again.'  And with that he straightened out his big back and held up  his fine proud head, and walked out.  I saw him from the window striding  down the avenue.  My! but he is a proud boy, sir--an honour to your  family, sir, say I respectfully.  And there, the proud child has gone  away hungry, and he won't, I know, ever use that shilling to buy food!\"    Father was not going to have that, you know, so he said to her:    \"He does not belong to my family, I would have you to know.  True, he is  allied to us through the female side; but we do not count him or his in  my family.\"  He turned away and began to read a book.  It was a decided  snub to her.    But mother had a word to say before Mrs. Martindale was done with.  Mother has a pride of her own, and doesn't brook insolence from  inferiors; and the housekeeper's conduct seemed to be rather presuming.  Mother, of course, isn't quite our class, though her folk are quite  worthy and enormously rich.  She is one of the Dalmallingtons, the salt  people, one of whom got a peerage when the Conservatives went out.  She  said to the housekeeper:    \"I think, Mrs. Martindale, that I shall not require your services after  this day month!  And as I don't keep servants in my employment when I  dismiss them, here is your month's wages due on the 25th of this month,  and another month in lieu of notice.  Sign this receipt.\"  She was  writing a receipt as she spoke.  The other signed it without a word, and  handed it to her.  She seemed quite flabbergasted.  Mother got up and  sailed--that is the way that mother moves when she is in a wax--out of  the room.    Lest I should forget it, let me say here that the dismissed housekeeper  was engaged the very next day by the Countess of Salop.  I may say in  explanation that the Earl of Salop, K.G., who is Lord-Lieutenant of the  County, is jealous of father's position and his growing influence.  Father is going to contest the next election on the Conservative side,  and is sure to be made a Baronet before long.    _Letter from Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie_, _V.C._,  _K.C.B._, _of Croom_, _Ross_, _N.B._, _to Rupert Sent Leger_, _Esq._, 14,  _Newland Park_, _Dulwich_, _London_, _S.E._                                                               _July_ 4, 1892.        MY DEAR GODSON,        I am truly sorry I am unable to agree with your request that I should      acquiesce in your desire to transfer to Miss Janet MacKelpie the      property bequeathed to you by your mother, of which property I am a      trustee.  Let me say at once that, had it been possible to me to do      so, I should have held it a privilege to further such a wish--not      because the beneficiare whom you would create is a near kinswoman of      my own.  That, in truth, is my real difficulty.  I have undertaken a      trust made by an honourable lady on behalf of her only son--son of a      man of stainless honour, and a dear friend of my own, and whose son      has a rich heritage of honour from both parents, and who will, I am      sure, like to look back on his whole life as worthy of his parents,      and of those whom his parents trusted.  You will see, I am sure, that      whatsoever I might grant regarding anyone else, my hands are tied in      this matter.        And now let me say, my dear boy, that your letter has given me the      most intense pleasure.  It is an unspeakable delight to me to find in      the son of your father--a man whom I loved, and a boy whom I      love--the same generosity of spirit which endeared your father to all      his comrades, old as well as young.  Come what may, I shall always be      proud of you; and if the sword of an old soldier--it is all I      have--can ever serve you in any way, it and its master's life are,      and shall be, whilst life remains to him, yours.        It grieves me to think that Janet cannot, through my act, be given      that ease and tranquillity of spirit which come from competence.      But, my dear Rupert, you will be of full age in seven years more.      Then, if you are in the same mind--and I am sure you will not      change--you, being your own master, can do freely as you will.  In      the meantime, to secure, so far as I can, my dear Janet against any      malign stroke of fortune, I have given orders to my factor to remit      semi-annually to Janet one full half of such income as may be derived      in any form from my estate of Croom.  It is, I am sorry to say,      heavily mortgaged; but of such as is--or may be, free from such      charge as the mortgage entails--something at least will, I trust,      remain to her.  And, my dear boy, I can frankly say that it is to me      a real pleasure that you and I can be linked in one more bond in this      association of purpose.  I have always held you in my heart as though      you were my own son.  Let me tell you now that you have acted as I      should have liked a son of my own, had I been blessed with one, to      have acted.  God bless you, my dear.                                                                   Yours ever,                                                      COLIN ALEX. MACKELPIE.    _Letter from Roger Melton_, _of Openshaw Grange_, _to Rupert Sent Leger_,  _Esq._, 14, _Newland Park_, _Dulwich_, _London_, _S.E._                                                               _July_ 1, 1892.        MY DEAR NEPHEW,        Your letter of the 30th ult. received.  Have carefully considered      matter stated, and have come to the conclusion that my duty as a      trustee would not allow me to give full consent, as you wish.  Let me      explain.  The testator, in making her will, intended that such      fortune as she had at disposal should be used to supply to you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#3)"],[1,"of breath.    TEIRESIAS  I say thou livest with thy nearest kin  In infamy, unwitting in thy shame.    OEDIPUS  Think'st thou for aye unscathed to wag thy tongue?    TEIRESIAS  Yea, if the might of truth can aught prevail.  OEDIPUS  With other men, but not with thee, for thou  In ear, wit, eye, in everything art blind.    TEIRESIAS  Poor fool to utter gibes at me which all  Here present will cast back on thee ere long.    OEDIPUS  Offspring of endless Night, thou hast no power  O'er me or any man who sees the sun.    TEIRESIAS  No, for thy weird is not to fall by me.  I leave to Apollo what concerns the god.    OEDIPUS  Is this a plot of Creon, or thine own?    TEIRESIAS  Not Creon, thou thyself art thine own bane.    OEDIPUS  O wealth and empiry and skill by skill  Outwitted in the battlefield of life,  What spite and envy follow in your train!  See, for this crown the State conferred on me.  A gift, a thing I sought not, for this crown  The trusty Creon, my familiar friend,  Hath lain in wait to oust me and suborned  This mountebank, this juggling charlatan,  This tricksy beggar-priest, for gain alone  Keen-eyed, but in his proper art stone-blind.  Say, sirrah, hast thou ever proved thyself  A prophet?  When the riddling Sphinx was here  Why hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?  And yet the riddle was not to be solved  By guess-work but required the prophet's art;  Wherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds  Nor sign from heaven helped thee, but _I_ came,  The simple Oedipus; _I_ stopped her mouth  By mother wit, untaught of auguries.  This is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,  In hope to reign with Creon in my stead.  Methinks that thou and thine abettor soon  Will rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.  Thank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn  What chastisement such arrogance deserves.    CHORUS  To us it seems that both the seer and thou,  O Oedipus, have spoken angry words.  This is no time to wrangle but consult  How best we may fulfill the oracle.    TEIRESIAS  King as thou art, free speech at least is mine  To make reply; in this I am thy peer.  I own no lord but Loxias; him I serve  And ne'er can stand enrolled as Creon's man.  Thus then I answer:  since thou hast not spared  To twit me with my blindness--thou hast eyes,  Yet see'st not in what misery thou art fallen,  Nor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.  Dost know thy lineage?  Nay, thou know'st it not,  And all unwitting art a double foe  To thine own kin, the living and the dead;  Aye and the dogging curse of mother and sire  One day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,  Beyond our borders, and the eyes that now  See clear shall henceforward endless night.  Ah whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,  What crag in all Cithaeron but shall then  Reverberate thy wail, when thou hast found  With what a hymeneal thou wast borne  Home, but to no fair haven, on the gale!  Aye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not  Shall set thyself and children in one line.  Flout then both Creon and my words, for none  Of mortals shall be striken worse than thou.    OEDIPUS  Must I endure this fellow's insolence?  A murrain on thee!  Get thee hence!  Begone  Avaunt! and never cross my threshold more.    TEIRESIAS  I ne'er had come hadst thou not bidden me.    OEDIPUS  I know not thou wouldst utter folly, else  Long hadst thou waited to be summoned here.    TEIRESIAS  Such am I--as it seems to thee a fool,  But to the parents who begat thee, wise.    OEDIPUS  What sayest thou--\"parents\"?  Who begat me, speak?    TEIRESIAS  This day shall be thy birth-day, and thy grave.    OEDIPUS  Thou lov'st to speak in riddles and dark words.    TEIRESIAS  In reading riddles who so skilled as thou?    OEDIPUS  Twit me with that wherein my greatness lies.    TEIRESIAS  And yet this very greatness proved thy bane.    OEDIPUS  No matter if I saved the commonwealth.    TEIRESIAS  'Tis time I left thee.  Come, boy, take me home.    OEDIPUS  Aye, take him quickly, for his presence irks  And lets me; gone, thou canst not plague me more.    TEIRESIAS  I go, but first will tell thee why I came.  Thy frown I dread not, for thou canst not harm me.  Hear then:  this man whom thou hast sought to arrest  With threats and warrants this long while, the wretch  Who murdered Laius--that man is here.  He passes for an alien in the land  But soon shall prove a Theban, native born.  And yet his fortune brings him little joy;  For blind of seeing, clad in beggar's weeds,  For purple robes, and leaning on his staff,  To a strange land he soon shall grope his way.  And of the children, inmates of his home,  He shall be proved the brother and the sire,  Of her who bare him son and husband both,  Co-partner, and assassin of his sire.  Go in and ponder this, and if thou find  That I have missed the mark, henceforth declare  I have no wit nor skill in prophecy.  [Exeunt TEIRESIAS and OEDIPUS]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Who is he by voice immortal named from Pythia's rocky cell,  Doer of foul deeds of bloodshed, horrors that no tongue can tell?            A foot for flight he needs            Fleeter than storm-swift steeds,            For on his heels doth follow,  Armed with the lightnings of his Sire, Apollo.            Like sleuth-hounds too            The Fates pursue.    (Ant. 1)  Yea, but now flashed forth the summons from Parnassus' snowy peak,  \"Near and far the undiscovered doer of this murder seek!\"            Now like a sullen bull he roves            Through forest brakes and upland groves,            And vainly seeks to fly            The doom that ever nigh            Flits o'er his head,  Still by the avenging Phoebus sped,            The voice divine,            From Earth's mid shrine.  (Str. 2)  Sore perplexed am I by the words of the master seer.  Are  they true, are they false?  I know not and bridle my  tongue for     fear,  Fluttered with vague surmise; nor present nor future is clear.  Quarrel of ancient date or in days still near know I none  Twixt the Labdacidan house and our ruler, Polybus' son.  Proof is there none:  how then can I challenge our King's good name,  How in a blood-feud join for an untracked deed of shame?    (Ant. 2)  All wise are Zeus and Apollo, and nothing is hid from their ken;  They are gods; and in wits a man may surpass his fellow men;  But that a mortal seer knows more than I know--where  Hath this been proven?  Or how without sign assured, can I blame  Him who saved our State when the winged songstress came,  Tested and tried in the light of us all, like gold assayed?  How can I now assent when a crime is on Oedipus laid?    CREON  Friends, countrymen, I learn King Oedipus  Hath laid against me a most grievous charge,  And come to you protesting.  If he deems  That I have harmed or injured him in aught  By word or deed in this our present trouble,  I care not to prolong the span of life,  Thus ill-reputed; for the calumny  Hits not a single blot, but blasts my name,  If by the general voice I am denounced  False to the State and false by you my friends.    CHORUS  This taunt, it well may be, was blurted out  In petulance, not spoken advisedly.    CREON  Did any dare pretend that it was I  Prompted the seer to utter a forged charge?    CHORUS  Such things were said; with what intent I know not.    CREON  Were not his wits and vision all astray  When upon me he fixed this monstrous charge?    CHORUS  I know not; to my sovereign's acts I am blind.  But lo, he comes to answer for himself.  [Enter OEDIPUS.]    OEDIPUS  Sirrah, what mak'st thou here?  Dost thou presume  To approach my doors, thou brazen-faced rogue,  My murderer and the filcher of my crown?  Come, answer this, didst thou detect in me  Some touch of cowardice or witlessness,  That made thee undertake this enterprise?  I seemed forsooth too simple to perceive  The serpent stealing on me in the dark,  Or else too weak to scotch it when I saw.  This _thou_ art witless seeking to possess  Without a following or friends the crown,  A prize that followers and wealth must win.    CREON  Attend me.  Thou hast spoken, 'tis my turn  To make reply.  Then having heard me, judge.    OEDIPUS  Thou art glib of tongue, but I am slow to learn  Of thee; I know too well thy venomous hate.    CREON  First I would argue out this very point.    OEDIPUS  O argue not that thou art not a rogue.    CREON  If thou dost count a virtue stubbornness,  Unschooled by reason, thou art much astray.    OEDIPUS  If thou dost hold a kinsman may be wronged,  And no pains follow, thou art much to seek.    CREON  Therein thou judgest rightly, but this wrong  That thou allegest--tell me what it is.    OEDIPUS  Didst thou or didst thou not advise that I  Should call the priest?    CREON                           Yes, and I stand to it.    OEDIPUS  Tell me how long is it since Laius...    CREON  Since Laius...?  I follow not thy drift.    OEDIPUS  By violent hands was spirited away.    CREON  In the dim past, a many years agone.    OEDIPUS  Did the same prophet then pursue his craft?    CREON  Yes, skilled as now and in no less repute.    OEDIPUS  Did he at that time ever glance at me?    CREON  Not to my knowledge, not when I was by.    OEDIPUS  But was no search and inquisition made?    CREON  Surely full quest was made, but nothing learnt.    OEDIPUS  Why failed the seer to tell his story _then_?    CREON  I know not, and not knowing hold my tongue.    OEDIPUS  This much thou knowest and canst surely tell.    CREON  What's mean'st thou?  All I know I will declare.    OEDIPUS  But for thy prompting never had the seer  Ascribed to me the death of Laius.    CREON  If so he thou knowest best; but I  Would put thee to the question in my turn.    OEDIPUS  Question and prove me murderer if thou canst.    CREON  Then let me ask thee, didst thou wed my sister?    OEDIPUS  A fact so plain I cannot well deny.    CREON  And as thy consort queen she shares the throne?    OEDIPUS  I grant her freely all her"]]]
