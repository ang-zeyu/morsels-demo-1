All x6.5.]          [Illustration: FIG. 2: Palmar views of hands of two species of the         western complex of _Syrrhophus_. _pipilans_ (left, KU 58908, x6)         and _teretistes_ (center, KU 75269, and right, KU 75263,         respectively, x9).]      In _S. cystignathoides_ and _leprus_, the first finger is longer than  the second, and the first two fingers are equal in length in  _guttilatus_ and _marnockii_. In the other species the first finger is  shorter than the second.    Supernumerary tubercles are well developed on the plantar surfaces in  all species, except _S. guttilatus_, in which they are poorly defined  (Fig. 3). The relative sizes of the metatarsal tubercles has been used  in the classification of the species and species groups of _Syrrhophus_.  The metatarsal tubercles are similar in all species of the eastern  complex (including _rubrimaculatus_); the outer tubercle is always about  one-half the size of the ovoid inner metatarsal tubercle. In the  _leprus_ group the outer tubercle is conical and compressed. The  metatarsal tubercles of _pipilans_ are about the same size, or the outer  is slightly smaller than the inner. In the _modestus_ group the outer  metatarsal tubercle is about one-third the size of the inner.    All species, except _guttilatus_, have well-defined to poorly defined  lateral fringes on the toes. All species have expanded toe pads. The  fifth toe is usually shorter than the third, but the second is equal  in length to the fifth in some specimens of _S. cystignathoides_ and  _S. marnockii_. _Syrrhophus nivocolimae_ is the only species with  tubercles along the outer edge of the tarsus; this is merely a  reflection of the highly tuberculate nature of the skin in this species.      _Skin texture._--The skin of the dorsum is smooth or very weakly  pustular in all species of the genus except _nivocolimae_ and  _verrucipes_. The dorsal surfaces of _nivocolimae_ are warty; in  _verrucipes_ the skin is pustular. The skin of the venter is areolate in  _cystignathoides cystignathoides_, _dennisi_ and _verrucipes_ but is  smooth in all other species of the genus.        [Illustration: FIG. 3: Plantar views of feet of four species of the         eastern complex of _Syrrhophus_. (A) _guttilatus_ (UIMNH 55519, x6),         (B) _leprus_ (UIMNH 42726, x6), (C) _verrucipes_ (UIMNH 15995, x6),         and (D) _longipes_ (TCWC 12179, x4.6).]      _Color pattern._--As is evident in the diagnoses, the color patterns of  given populations have been regarded as useful in separating the  species and subspecies. Duellman (1958) suggested that the coloration,  with the exception of _modestus_, was a dark ground color with pale  markings. It is a moot point whether the frogs have light spots on a  dark background or have a light background with an extensive reticulate  dark pattern. The venters are gray or white, and the vocal sac is nearly  black in some species. Interorbital dark bars or triangles are absent in  only two species of the eastern complex, _cystignathoides campi_ and  _marnockii_; the latter lacks a supratympanic stripe, which is present  in the other members of the eastern complex. _Syrrhophus interorbitalis_  and _nivocolimae_ have light interorbital bars; these bars occur in only  one other population of the genus (_S. c. cystignathoides_). Bars on the  thighs are ill defined or absent in the members of the _marnockii_ and  part of the _modestus_ groups. The color in life is noted in the species  accounts.      _Voice._--The voices of all _Syrrhophus_ can be described as a  single short chirp or peep; without audiospectrographic analyses  the significance of the differences between a chirp, peep, or short  whistle cannot be appreciated. Martin (1958) and Wright and  Wright (1949) reported multi-noted calls, and one collector of  _S. verrucipes_ noted the frog \"trilled.\"    Fouquette (1960) presented analyses of two species (_marnockii_  and _pipilans nebulosus_). The voices were very similar; both frogs  were reported to \"trill\" and \"chirp.\"          SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT      The genus _Syrrhophus_ has been defined (Lynch, 1968) and limited to the  group of species occurring in Guatemala, Mexico and the United States.  The closest relatives of _Syrrhophus_ are the frogs of the genus  _Tomodactylus_ (Dixon, 1957; Firschein, 1954). Lynch (1968)  implied there were no osteological bases for the separation of  _Eleutherodactylus_, _Syrrhophus_, and _Tomodactylus_. At that time, I  believed such to be the case and derived _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_  from the _rhodopis_ complex of _Eleutherodactylus_, with which they  share terrestrial habits and relatively short limbs. In the _rhodopis_  complex there is a tendency for the loss of the outer palmar tubercle, a  not uncommon condition in _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_.    However, the skulls of _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_ show departures  from the pattern observed in the Middle American _Eleutherodactylus_, as  well as many of those species in western South America. Baldauf and  Tanzer (1965) reported that the frontoparietals and prootics were fused  in _Syrrhophus marnockii_ and that the prootics and exoccipitals  appeared to be one bone (otoccipital). The otoccipital is not uncommon  in eleutherodactyline frogs, but the fusion of the frontoparietals with  the prootics (regardless of the fusion of the latter with the  exoccipital) is uncommon in the family. I have found the  frontoparietal-prootic fusion only in _Syrrhophus_ (all species),  _Tomodactylus_ (all species), and _Eleutherodactylus_ (West Indies  species). None of the Middle American _Eleutherodactylus_ has the two  bones fused. Examination of the character is difficult in dried skeletal  preparations. Cleared and stained or macerated preparations are  satisfactory for checking this character.    Thus, in addition to the presence of numerous plantar supernumerary  tubercles in the frogs of the genera _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_,  these two genera can be separated from other Middle American  eleutherodactylines by the fusion of the frontoparietals and prootics.  This character not only further strengthens the argument that the two  genera are closely related but poses a problem of zoogeographic analysis  of the distribution of the character, which will be discussed fully  elsewhere.

[Illustration: The earliest map of the world. By Hecataeus of Miletus  (sixth century B.C.). Probably copied in part from Anaximander, inventor  of map drawing.]    The fiery Ruy Faleiro, when he found that his friend had opened their  confidential secret, partly broke friendship with him. Magellan could  only acknowledge his error, and say that he never meant in his heart to  betray the secrets of his friend, the cosmographer.    Faleiro dreamed on, but his mind weakened.    The popular legend about this unhappy man was, that being an astrologer  he cast his own horoscope, and found that the expedition that he hoped  to command would be lost, and so feigned madness. This is only a story.    Faleiro died in Seville about 1523.    It would be interesting to know if he lived to hear of the great  discovery of his old friend Magellan, and if he joined in the general  rejoicing over it. It is probable that he lived to see the strange ways  by which his countryman had been led, not over a short passage, but over  far-distant seas. His was a pitiable fate; but his name merits honorable  mention among men, who, like Miranda in South America, have inspired  great deeds which they themselves could not accomplish.    Men of vision and men of action are essential to each other; for many  men can see what only a few others can perform.    Magellan married Beatriz Barbosa about the year 1518. He was the father  of one son. His wife died shortly after hearing the news of his great  discovery of the Pacific and the new way to the East.    He was now prepared to go to Charles V, King of Spain, son of the  demented Queen Joanna, the daughter of Isabella, and to lay before him a  plan of opening a short way to the East by sailing West. This purpose  more and more absorbed his soul--he himself was nothing, discovery was  everything. The frown of Portugal no longer cast any deep shadow over  his life; it was his mission to _find_. He heard in the acclaim of  Columbus a prophecy of what his own name would one day be.          CHAPTER III.    PRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR AND VASCO DA GAMA.      All things follow suggestion and inspiration, and the discovery of the  Western World owes much to the heart and brain of Prince Henry, called  the Navigator. Although the son of a King, he felt that he was more than  that--a son of Humanity. He took up his residence far from the pomp of  courts on the bleak, bare, solitary promontory of Sagres, the sharp  angle of Western Europe. Here he could see the sun go down on the  western sea, day by day. Some inward genius like a haunting spirit  seemed to beckon his thoughts toward the West.    In view of his abode on a tall headland were the ruins of a Druidical  temple, where Strabo tells us the gods used to assemble at night under  the moon and stars. So the place was called the Sacrum Promontorium, and  it was in this region that Prince Henry schooled his soul in navigation  and sought to inspire all adventurers upon the sea. \"Farther\" was his  motto, and \"Farther yet!\" In his solitude he called to him a company of  restless spirits with a passion for discovery, and said to them all,  \"Farther,\" and \"Farther yet!\"    The night of the dark ages was passing, and in the new dawn of  civilization, Prince Henry had visions of new ways to India, the  magnificent; the land of gold, gems, and spices, where the sun shone on  gardens of palms and seas of glory.    There were no lighthouses then on the African coast; there were no sea  charts, and the compass was but little known. But there were eternal  stars, and under them were the living instincts that awaken genius.    Prince Henry the Navigator was the fourth son of King Joao I, or John  the Great, and of Queen Philippa, of the Roses. He was a great-grandson  of Edward III, of England.    Prince Henry's motto was \"_Talent de bien faire_\"--\"talent of good  faculty.\" The motto furnishes in brief a history of his life.    The first fruit of Prince Henry's geographical studies was the discovery  of the islands of Madeira; but there were islands beyond Madeira, and  his restless spirit cried out in the night: \"Farther!\" and \"Farther  yet!\"    Cape Bojador, farther \"than the farthest point of the earth,\" rose just  before the supposed regions of sea monsters, fire, and darkness. Prince  John sent a navigator there, and found serene seas.    [Illustration: PROGRESS OF PORTUGUESE DISCOVERY]    \"Farther!\"    In 1446 the Prince obtained a charter of the Canary Islands. His ships  next discovered the Azores. But there were lands and islands and seas  \"farther yet.\"    [Illustration: Prince Henry the Navigator. From a drawing by Allegra  Eggleston, in The Story of Columbus.]    Prince Henry died in 1463, about thirty years before the triumph of  Columbus.    He was the father of modern discovery, the spirit of which rested not  until the map of the whole world could be drawn. He was buried in a  splendid tomb, and the pupils of his school of cosmography and  navigation continued to penetrate the ocean farther and farther to the  South and West. Vasco da Gama opened the ocean ways to India, and the  two great navigators, Columbus and Magellan, owed much to the spirit of  the Prince who left courts that he might found a school amid the sea  desolations of St. Vincent, in order to inspire young sailors to venture  always \"Farther!\" and \"Farther yet!\"    [Illustration: \"He is a renegade. His arms must come down!\" (See page  2.)]    We must here tell you something of Vasco da Gama, in order that you may  better understand the plan and purpose of Magellan.    Take your map of the world. Before the passage to India was discovered  by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, the trade between Asia  and Europe was carried on in this manner: There was a great commercial  city on the southern coast of Arabia (Arabia Felix) called Alda, or Port  Alda. It was a city of merchants. To this port came the ships from the  East--China, Japan, India--laden with gold, silk, and spices. The  merchants of Alda carried these goods to the Port of Suez on the Red  Sea. Thence the merchandise was conveyed on camels to the Nile and to  Alexandria, Egypt, and thence by ships to the ports of the  Mediterranean.    Vasco da Gama discovered a new way to India by doubling the Cape of Good  Hope, and when he returned from that voyage all Europe rang with his  praise. His discovery of the way to India from the Mediterranean by  rounding Africa was one of the most momentous ever made. Vasco da Gama  holds rank with Columbus in the unveiling of the mysteries of the ocean  world.    King John the Navigator had heard such wonderful tales of India that he  wished to find a way there by water. He accordingly sent one Bartholomeu  Diaz on an expedition with this end in view. Diaz did not find India,  but he found a cape on the southernmost point of Africa, which he  doubled.    So fearful were the tempests there that he called it the Cape of Storms.    But King John saw that the islands of India lay in that direction, and  he exclaimed in delight on hearing Diaz's narrative of the tempestuous  place:    \"'Tis the Cape of Good Hope!\" This gave the cape its name.    A Jewish astrologer told Dom Manoel, King of Portugal, that the riches  of India could yet be found by way of the sea. Of such a discovery the  new King dreamed. Who should he get to undertake a voyage with such a  purpose?    One day, as he sat in his halls among his courtiers and grandees  studying maps, a man of about thirty years, who had a noble bearing,  entered an outer apartment. A sword hung by his side.    The King, who had been thinking of his great mariners, lifted his face  and said:    \"Thank God! I have found my man. Bring to me Vasco da Gama.\"    He it was that stood in the outer hall.    \"Vasco,\" said the King, \"I know your soul. For the glory of Portugal you  must find India by the way of the sea!\"    \"I am at your service, sire, while life shall last.\"    \"Depart in all haste.\"    It was March, 1497. Vasco da Gama raised his sails and departed from  Lisbon.    [Illustration: Vasco da Gama.]    He passed the \"Cape of Good Hope,\" and met with many adventures, the  narratives of which would fill a book.    He crossed the India Ocean, blown pleasantly on by the trade winds.    One day a loud cry arose:    \"Land! land!\"    The pilot came running to Vasco da Gama, and fell at his feet.    \"Captain, behold India!\"    The shores of India rose in the burning light of the tropic seas. Vasco  da Gama saw them and fell upon his knees.    Mountain rose above mountain, and hill over hill; then green palms and  shining beaches came into view like scenes of enchantment.    \"That is Cananor,\" said the Moorish pilot; \"the great city of Calicat is  twelve leagues distant.\"    They sailed over those twelve leagues of clear resplendent waters and  came to Calicat, or Malabar. That day of discovery was Portugal's  glory.    [Illustration: PORTUGUESE INDIES]    Calicat was a merchant city of the East, and one of the most famous of  India. Here came Arabian and Egyptian merchants. It was a Mohammedan  city, and the princes of Calicat encouraged trade between the Arabs and  Hindoos. The city was now to become an emporium for the Western World.    After many adventures in Malabar, Vasco da Gama cruised along the coast  of India. Everything was wonderful, and the wonders grew.    In September, 1499, he returned, and was received like a sovereign by  the Portuguese King. His arrival was a holiday, the glory of which has  lived in all Portuguese holidays until now.    He was given titles of distinction. He was made a Viceroy of India.    Twenty years after these events Magellan was destined to discover  _another_ way to India.          CHAPTER IV.
