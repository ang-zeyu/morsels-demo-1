It has to be  cleaned, passed through a machine that tears it into bits, then  between rollers before it is ready to be manufactured. It is not  elastic like rubber; it may be stretched; but it will not snap back  again as rubber does. It is a remarkably good nonconductor of  electricity, and therefore it has been generally used to protect ocean  cables, though recently rubber has been taking its place. It makes  particularly excellent casts, for when it is warm it is not sticky,  but softens so perfectly that it will show the tiniest indentation of  a mould. It is the best kind of splint for a broken bone. If a boy  breaks his arm, a surgeon can put a piece of gutta-percha into hot  water, set the bone, bind on the softened gutta-percha for a splint,  and in a few minutes it will be moulded to the exact shape of the arm,  but so stiff as to keep the bone in place. Another good service which  gutta-percha renders to the physician results from its willingness  to dissolve in chloroform. If the skin is torn off, leaving a raw  surface, this dissolved gutta-percha can be poured over it, and soon  it is protected by an artificial skin which keeps the air from the raw  flesh and gives the real skin an opportunity to grow again.          III    \"KID\" GLOVES      There is an old proverb which says, \"For a good glove, Spain must  dress the leather, France must cut it, and England must sew it.\" Many  pairs of most excellent gloves have never seen any one of these  countries, but the moral of the proverb remains, namely, that it takes  considerable work and care to make a really good glove.    The first gloves made in the United States were of thick buckskin, for  there was much heavy work to be done in the forest and on the land.  The skin was tanned in Indian fashion, by rubbing into the flesh side  the brains of the deer--though how the Indians ever thought of using  them is a mystery. Later, the white folk tried to tan with pigs'  brains; but however valuable the brains of a pig may be to himself,  they do not contain the properties of soda ash which made those of  the deer useful for this purpose.    [Illustration: CUTTING HIDES INTO GLOVES    The hides are kept in racks, and before cutting are stretched by hand.  Then the steel die cuts out the shape of the glove. Notice the  curiously shaped cut for the thumb.]    Years ago, when a man set out to manufacture gloves, usually only a  few dozen pairs, he cut out a pattern from a shingle or a piece of  pasteboard, laid it upon a skin, marked around it, and cut it out with  shears. Pencils were not common, but the glovemaker was fully equal  to making his own. He melted some lead, ran it into a crack in the  kitchen floor--and cracks were plentiful--and then used this  \"plummet,\" as it was called, for a marker. After cutting the large  piece for the front and back of the glove, he cut out from the scraps  remaining the \"fourchettes,\" or _forks_; that is, the narrow strips  that make the sides of the fingers. Smaller scraps were put in to welt  the seams; and all this went off in great bundles to farmhouses to  be sewed by the farmers' wives and daughters for the earning of  pin-money. If the gloves were to be the most genteel members of the  buckskin race, there was added to the bundle a skein of silk, with  which a slender vine was to be worked on the back of the hand. The  sewing was done with a needle three-sided at the point, and a stout  waxed thread was used. A needle of this sort went in more easily than  a round one, but even then it was rather wearisome to push it through  three thicknesses of stout buckskin. Moreover, if the sewer happened  to take hold of the needle too near the point, the sharp edges were  likely to make little cuts in her fingers.    After a while sewing machines were invented, and factories were built,  and now in a single county of the State of New York many thousand  people are at work making various kinds of leather coverings for their  own hands and those of other folk. Better methods of tanning have been  discovered, and many sorts of leather are now used, especially for  the heavier gloves. Deer are not so common as they used to be, and a  \"buckskin\" glove is quite likely to have been made of the hide of  a cow or a horse. \"Kid\" generally comes from the body of a sheep  instead of that of a young goat. Our best real kidskin comes from a  certain part of France, where the climate seems to be just suited to  the young kids, there is plenty of the food that they like, and, what  is fully as important, they receive the best of care. It is said that  to produce the very finest kidskin, the kids are fed on nothing but  milk, are treated with the utmost gentleness, and are kept in coops or  pens carefully made so that there shall be nothing to scratch their  tender skins.    Glovemakers are always on the lookout for new kinds of material, and  when, not many years ago, there came from Arabia with a shipment of  Mocha coffee two bales of an unknown sort of skin, they were eager to  try it. It tanned well and made a glove that has been a favorite from  the first. The skin was found to come from a sheep living in Arabia,  Abyssinia, and near the headwaters of the river Nile. It was named  Mocha from the coffee with which it came, and Mocha it has been ever  since. The Suede glove has a surface much like that of the Mocha. Its  name came from \"Swede,\" because the Swedes were the first to use the  skin with the outside in.    Most of our thinner \"kid\" gloves are made of lambskin; but dressing  the skins is now done so skillfully in this country that \"homemade\"  gloves are in many respects fully as good as the imported; indeed,  some judges declare that in shape and stitching certain grades are  better. When sheepskins and lambskins come to market from a distance,  they are salted. They have to be soaked in water, all bits of flesh  scraped off, and the hair removed, generally by the use of lime. After  another washing, they are put into alum and salt for a few minutes;  and after washing this off, they are dried, stretched, and then are  ready for the softening. Nothing has been found that will soften the  skins so perfectly as a mixture of flour, salt, and the yolk of  eggs--\"custard,\" as the workmen call it. The custard and the skins  are tumbled together into a great iron drum which revolves till the  custard has been absorbed and the skins are soft and yielding. Now  they are stretched one way and another, and wet so thoroughly that  they lose all the alum and salt that may be left and also much of  the custard.    Now comes dyeing. The skin is laid upon a table, smooth side up, and  brushed over several times with the coloring matter; very lightly,  however, for if the coloring goes through the leather, the hands of  the customers may be stained and they will buy no more gloves of that  make. The skins are now moistened and rolled and left for several  weeks to season. When they are unrolled, the whole skin is soft and  pliable. It is thick, however, and no one who is not an expert can  thin it properly. The process is called \"mooning\" because the knife  used is shaped like a crescent moon. It is flat, its center is cut  out, and the outer edge is sharpened. Over the inner curve is a  handle. The skin is hung on a pole, and the expert workman draws  the mooning knife down it until any bit of dried flesh remaining has  been removed, and the skin is of the same thickness, or, rather,  thinness throughout.    All this slow, careful work is needed to prepare the skin for cutting  out the glove; and now it goes to the cutter. There is no longer any  cutting out of gloves with shears and pasteboard patterns, but there  is a quick way and a slow way nevertheless. The man who cuts in the  quick way, the \"block-cutter,\" as he is called, spreads out the skin  on a big block made by bolting together planks of wood with the grain  running up and down. He places a die in the shape of the glove upon  the leather, gives one blow with a heavy maul, and the glove is cut  out. This answers very well for the cheaper and coarser gloves, but to  cut fine gloves is quite a different matter. This needs skill, and it  is said that no man can do good \"table-cutting\" who has not had at  least three years' experience; and even then he may not be able to do  really first-class work. He dampens the skin, stretches it first one  way and then the other, and examines it closely for flaws or scratches  or weak places. He must put on his die in such a way as to get two  pairs of ordinary gloves or one pair of \"elbow gloves\" out of the skin  if possible, and yet he must avoid the poor places if there are any.  No glove manufacturer can afford to employ an unskilled or careless  cutter, for he will waste much more than his wages amount to. There  used to be one die for the right hand and another for the left, and  it was some time before it occurred to any one that the same die would  cut both gloves if only the skin was turned over.    [Illustration: CLOSING THE GLOVE    When sewing time comes, the glove goes from hand to hand down the  workroom, each stitcher doing a certain seam or seams.]    [Illustration: WHERE THE GLOVE GETS ITS SHAPE    After inspection the glove goes to a row of men who fit it on a  steam-heated brass hand, giving it its final shape and finish.]    Now comes the sewing. Count the pieces in a glove, and this will give  some idea of the work needed to sew them together. Notice that the  fourchettes are sewed together on the wrong side, the other seams on  the right side, and that the tiny bits of facing and lining are hemmed  down by hand. Notice that two of the fingers have only one fourchette,  while the others have two fourchettes each. Notice how neatly the ends  of the fingers are finished, with never an end of thread left on the  right side.

Adams actually completed his investigation  first; but a delay at Cambridge in examining that portion of the sky,  where he announced that the body ought just then to be, allowed France  to snatch the honour of discovery, and the new planet was found by the  observer Galle at Berlin, very near the place in the heavens which Le  Verrier had mathematically predicted for it.    Nearly fifty years later, that is to say, in our own time, another  important planetary discovery was made. One of the recent additions to  the numerous and constantly increasing family of the asteroids, a tiny  body brought to light in 1898, turned out after all not to be  circulating in the customary space between Mars and Jupiter, but  actually in that between our earth and Mars. This body is very small,  not more than about twenty miles across. It has received the name of  Eros (the Greek equivalent for Cupid), in allusion to its insignificant  size as compared with the other leading members of the system.    This completes the list of the planets which, so far, have revealed  themselves to us. Whether others exist time alone will show. Two or  three have been suspected to revolve beyond the path of Neptune; and it  has even been asserted, on more than one occasion, that a planet  circulates nearer to the sun than Mercury. This supposed body, to which  the name of \"Vulcan\" was provisionally given, is said to have been  \"discovered\" in 1859 by a French doctor named Lescarbault, of Orgeres  near Orleans; but up to the present there has been no sufficient  evidence of its existence. The reason why such uncertainty should exist  upon this point is easy enough to understand, when we consider the  overpowering glare which fills our atmosphere all around the sun's place  in the sky. Mercury, the nearest known planet to the sun, is for this  reason always very difficult to see; and even when, in its course, it  gets sufficiently far from the sun to be left for a short time above the  horizon after sunset, it is by no means an easy object to observe on  account of the mists which usually hang about low down near the earth.  One opportunity, however, offers itself from time to time to solve the  riddle of an \"intra-Mercurial\" planet, that is to say, of a planet which  circulates within the path followed by Mercury. The opportunity in  question is furnished by a total eclipse of the sun; for when, during an  eclipse of that kind, the body of the moon for a few minutes entirely  hides the sun's face, and the dazzling glare is thus completely cut off,  astronomers are enabled to give an unimpeded, though all too hurried,  search to the region close around. A goodly number of total eclipses of  the sun have, however, come and gone since the days of Lescarbault, and  no planet, so far, has revealed itself in the intra-Mercurial space. It  seems, therefore, quite safe to affirm that no globe of sufficient size  to be seen by means of our modern telescopes circulates nearer to the  sun than the planet Mercury.    Next in importance to the planets, as permanent members of the solar  system, come the relatively small and secondary bodies known by the name  of Satellites. The name _satellite_ is derived from a Latin word  signifying _an attendant_; for the bodies so-called move along always in  close proximity to their respective \"primaries,\" as the planets which  they accompany are technically termed.    The satellites cannot be considered as allotted with any particular  regularity among the various members of the system; several of the  planets, for instance, having a goodly number of these bodies  accompanying them, while others have but one or two, and some again have  none at all. Taking the planets in their order of distance outward from  the Sun, we find that neither Mercury nor Venus are provided with  satellites; the Earth has only one, viz. our neighbour the Moon; while  Mars has but two tiny ones, so small indeed that one might imagine them  to be merely asteroids, which had wandered out of their proper region  and attached themselves to that planet. For the rest, so far as we at  present know, Jupiter possesses seven,[2] Saturn ten, Uranus four, and  Neptune one. It is indeed possible, nay more, it is extremely probable,  that the two last-named planets have a greater number of these secondary  bodies revolving around them; but, unfortunately, the Uranian and  Neptunian systems are at such immense distances from us, that even the  magnificent telescopes of to-day can extract very little information  concerning them.    From the distribution of the satellites, the reader will notice that the  planets relatively near to the sun are provided with few or none, while  the more distant planets are richly endowed. The conclusion, therefore,  seems to be that nearness to the sun is in some way unfavourable either  to the production, or to the continued existence, of satellites.    A planet and its satellites form a repetition of the solar system on a  tiny scale. Just as the planets revolve around the sun, so do these  secondary bodies revolve around their primaries. When Galileo, in 1610,  turned his newly invented telescope upon Jupiter, he quickly recognised  in the four circling moons which met his gaze, a miniature edition of  the solar system.    Besides the planets and their satellites, there are two other classes of  bodies which claim membership of the solar system. These are Comets and  Meteors. Comets differ from the bodies which we have just been  describing in that they appear filmy and transparent, whereas the others  are solid and opaque. Again, the paths of the planets around the sun and  of the satellites around their primaries are not actually circles; they  are ovals, but their ovalness is not of a marked degree. The paths of  comets on the other hand are usually _very_ oval; so that in their  courses many of them pass out as far as the known limits of the solar  system, and even far beyond. It should be mentioned that nowadays the  tendency is to consider comets as permanent members of the system,  though this was formerly not by any means an article of faith with  astronomers.    Meteors are very small bodies, as a rule perhaps no larger than pebbles,  which move about unseen in space, and of which we do not become aware  until they arrive very close to the earth. They are then made visible to  us for a moment or two in consequence of being heated to a white heat by  the friction of rushing through the atmosphere, and are thus usually  turned into ashes and vapour long before they reach the surface of our  globe. Though occasionally a meteoric body survives the fiery ordeal,  and reaches the earth more or less in a solid state to bury itself deep  in the soil, the majority of these celestial visitants constitute no  source of danger whatever for us. Any one who will take the trouble to  gaze at the sky for a short time on a clear night, is fairly certain to  be rewarded with the view of a meteor. The impression received is as if  one of the stars had suddenly left its accustomed place, and dashed  across the heavens, leaving in its course a trail of light. It is for  this reason that meteors are popularly known under the name of \"shooting  stars.\"      [1] By the Italian astronomer, Piazzi, at Palermo.    [2] Probably eight. (See note, page 232.)          CHAPTER III    THE SOLAR SYSTEM      We have seen, in the course of the last chapter, that the solar system  is composed as follows:--there is a central body, the sun, around which  revolve along stated paths a number of important bodies known as  planets. Certain of these planets, in their courses, carry along in  company still smaller bodies called satellites, which revolve around  them. With regard, however, to the remaining members of the system, viz.  the comets and the meteors, it is not advisable at this stage to add  more to what has been said in the preceding chapter. For the time being,  therefore, we will devote our attention merely to the sun, the planets,  and the satellites.    Of what shape then are these bodies? Of one shape, and that one alone  which appears to characterise all solid objects in the celestial spaces:  they are spherical, which means _round like a ball_.    Each of these spherical bodies rotates; that is to say, turns round and  round, as a top does when it is spinning. This rotation is said to take  place \"upon an axis,\" a statement which may be explained as  follows:--Imagine a ball with a knitting-needle run right through its  centre. Then imagine this needle held pointing in one fixed direction  while the ball is turned round and round. Well, it is the same thing  with the earth. As it journeys about the sun, it keeps turning round and  round continually as if pivoted upon a mighty knitting needle  transfixing it from North Pole to South Pole. In reality, however, there  is no such material axis to regulate the constant direction of the  rotation, just as there are no actual supports to uphold the earth  itself in space. The causes which keep the celestial spheres poised, and  which control their motions, are far more wonderful than any mechanical  device.    At this juncture it will be well to emphasise the sharp distinction  between the terms _rotation_ and _revolution_. The term \"rotation\" is  invariably used by astronomers to signify the motion which a celestial  body has upon an axis; the term \"revolution,\" on the other hand, is used  for the movement of one celestial body around another. Speaking of the  earth, for instance, we say, that it _rotates_ on its axis, and that it  _revolves_ around the sun.    So far, nothing has been said about the sizes of the members of our  system. Is there any stock size, any pattern according to which they may  be judged? None whatever! They vary enormously. Very much the largest of  all is the"]]]
