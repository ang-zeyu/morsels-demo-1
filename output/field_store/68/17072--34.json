[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#3)"],[1," plea in abatement is necessarily under consideration;  and it becomes, therefore, our duty to decide whether the facts stated  in the plea are or are not sufficient to show that the plaintiff is  not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the United States.    This is certainly a very serious question, and one that now for the  first time has been brought for decision before this court. But it is  brought here by those who have a right to bring it, and it is our duty  to meet it and decide it.    The question is simply this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were  imported into this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the  political community formed and brought into existence by the  Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to all  the rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that  instrument to the citizen? One of which rights is the privilege of  suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified in the  Constitution.    It will be observed, that the plea applies to that class of persons  only whose ancestors were negroes of the African race, and imported  into this country, and sold and held as slaves. The only matter in  issue before the court, therefore, is, whether the descendants of such  slaves, when they shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who  had become free before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the  sense in which the word citizen is used in the Constitution of the  United States. And this being the only matter in dispute on the  pleadings, the court must be understood as speaking in this opinion of  that class only, that is, of those persons who are the descendants of  Africans who were imported into this country, and sold as slaves.    The situation of this population was altogether unlike that of the  Indian race. The latter, it is true, formed no part of the colonial  communities, and never amalgamated with them in social connections or  in government. But although they were uncivilized, they were yet a  free and independent people, associated together in nations or tribes,  and governed by their own laws. Many of these political communities  were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the  ultimate right of dominion. But that claim was acknowledged to be  subject to the right of the Indians to occupy it as long as they  thought proper, and neither the English nor colonial Governments  claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it  was occupied, nor claimed the right to the possession of the  territory, until the tribe or nation consented to cede it. These  Indian Governments were regarded and treated as foreign Governments,  as much so as if an ocean had separated the red man from the white;  and their freedom has constantly been acknowledged, from the time of  the first emigration to the English colonies to the present day, by  the different Governments which succeeded each other. Treaties have  been negotiated with them, and their alliance sought for in war; and  the people who compose these Indian political communities have always  been treated as foreigners not living under our Government. It is true  that the course of events has brought the Indian tribes within the  limits of the United States under subjection to the white race; and it  has been found necessary, for their sake as well as our own, to regard  them as in a state of pupilage, and to legislate to a certain extent  over them and the territory they occupy. But they may, without doubt,  like the subjects of any other foreign Government, be naturalized by  the authority of Congress, and become citizens of a State, and of the  United States; and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe,  and take up his abode among the white population, he would be entitled  to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant  from any other foreign people.    We proceed to examine the case as presented by the pleadings.    The words \"people of the United States\" and \"citizens\" are synonymous  terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body  who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty,  and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their  representatives. They are what we familiarly call the \"sovereign  people,\" and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent  member of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the  class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion  of this people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We  think they are not, and that they are not included, and were not  intended to be included, under the word \"citizens\" in the  Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and  privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens  of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time  considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had  been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not,  yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or  privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government  might choose to grant them.    It is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or  injustice, the policy or impolicy, of these laws. The decision of that  question belonged to the political or law-making power; to those who  formed the sovereignty and framed the Constitution. The duty of the  court is, to interpret the instrument they have framed, with the best  lights we can obtain on the subject, and to administer it as we find  it, according to its true intent and meaning when it was adopted.    In discussing this question, we must not confound the rights of  citizenship which a State may confer within its own limits, and the  rights of citizenship as a member of the Union. It does not by any  means follow, because he has all the rights and privileges of a  citizen of a State, that he must be a citizen of the United States. He  may have all of the rights and privileges of the citizen of a State,  and yet not be entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen in  any other State. For, previous to the adoption of the Constitution of  the United States, every State had the undoubted right to confer on  whomsoever it pleased the character of citizen, and to endow him with  all its rights. But this character of course was confined to the  boundaries of the State, and gave him no rights or privileges in other  States beyond those secured to him by the laws of nations and the  comity of States. Nor have the several States surrendered the power of  conferring these rights and privileges by adopting the Constitution of  the United States. Each State may still confer them upon an alien, or  any one it thinks proper, or upon any class or description of persons;  yet he would not be a citizen in the sense in which that word is used  in the Constitution of the United States, nor entitled to sue as such  in one of its courts, nor to the privileges and immunities of a  citizen in the other States. The rights which he would acquire would  be restricted to the State which gave them. The Constitution has  conferred on Congress the right to establish an uniform rule of  naturalization, and this right is evidently exclusive, and has always  been held by this court to be so. Consequently, no State, since the  adoption of the Constitution, can by naturalizing an alien invest him  with the rights and privileges secured to a citizen of a State under  the Federal Government, although, so far as the State alone was  concerned, he would undoubtedly be entitled to the rights of a  citizen, and clothed with all the rights and immunities which the  Constitution and laws of the State attached to that character.    It is very clear, therefore, that no State can, by any act or law of  its own, passed since the adoption of the Constitution, introduce a  new member into the political community created by the Constitution of  the United States. It cannot make him a member of this community by  making him a member of its own. And for the same reason it cannot  introduce any person, or description of persons, who were not intended  to be embraced in this new political family, which the Constitution  brought into existence, but were intended to be excluded from it.    The question then arises, whether the provisions of the Constitution,  in relation to the personal rights and privileges to which the citizen  of a State should be entitled, embraced the negro African race, at  that time in this country, or who might afterwards be imported, who  had then or should afterwards be made free in any State; and to put it  in the power of a single State to make him a citizen of the United  States, and endue him with the full rights of citizenship in every  other State without their consent? Does the Constitution of the United  States act upon him whenever he shall be made free under the laws of a  State, and raised there to the rank of a citizen, and immediately  clothe him with all the privileges of a citizen in every other State,  and in its own courts?    The court think the affirmative of these propositions cannot be  maintained. And if it cannot, the plaintiff in error could not be a  citizen of the State of Missouri, within the meaning of the  Constitution of the United States, and, consequently, was not entitled  to sue in its courts.    It is true, every person, and every class and description of persons,  who were at the time of the adoption of the Constitution recognised as  citizens in the several States, became also citizens of this new  political body; but none other; it was formed by them, and for them  and their posterity, but for no one else. And the personal rights and  privileges guarantied to citizens of this new sovereignty were  intended to embrace those only who were then members of the several  State"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#3)"],[1,"patient's faith in drugs and mate-  rial hygiene; but when once convinced of the uselessness  of such material methods, the gain is rapid.    It is a noticeable fact, that in families where laws [25]  of health are strictly enforced, great caution is observed  in regard to diet, and the conversation chiefly confined  to the ailments of the body, there is the most sickness.  Take a large family of children where the mother has  all that she can attend to in keeping them clothed and  fed, and health is generally the rule; whereas, in small  families of one or two children, sickness is by no means    [Page 7.]    the exception. These children must not be allowed to [1]  eat certain food, nor to breathe the cold air, because  there is danger in it; when they perspire, they must be  loaded down with coverings until their bodies become  dry,--and the mother of one child is often busier than [5]  the mother of eight.    Great charity and humility is necessary in this work  of healing. The loving patience of Jesus, we must  strive to emulate. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as  thyself\" has daily to be exemplified; and, although [10]  skepticism and incredulity prevail in places where  one would least expect it, it harms not; for if serving  Christ, Truth, of what can mortal opinion avail? Cast  not your pearls before swine; but if you cannot bring  peace to all, you can to many, if faithful laborers in His [15]  vineyard.    Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally  reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease  seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to  many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon [20]  the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to  some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper,  at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able  to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought.  A great work already has been done, and a greater work [25]  yet remains to be done. Oftentimes we are denied the  results of our labors because people do not understand  the nature and power of metaphysics, and they think  that health and strength would have returned natu-  rally without any assistance. This is not so much from [30]  a lack of justice, as it is that the _mens populi_ is not suffi-  ciently enlightened on this great subject. More thought    [Page 8.]    is given to material illusions than to spiritual facts. If [1]  we can aid in abating suffering and diminishing sin,  we shall have accomplished much; but if we can bring  to the general thought this great fact that drugs do not,  cannot, produce health and harmony, since \"in Him [5]  [Mind] we live, and move, and have our being,\" we shall  have done more.\"          Love Your Enemies.      Who is thine enemy that thou shouldst love him? Is  it a creature or a thing outside thine own creation? [10]    Can you see an enemy, except you first formulate this  enemy and then look upon the object of your own conception?  What is it that harms you? Can height, or  depth, or any other creature separate you from the  Love that is omnipresent good,--that blesses infinitely [15]  one and all?    Simply count your enemy to be that which defiles,  defaces, and dethrones the Christ-image that you should  reflect. Whatever purifies, sanctifies, and consecrates  human life, is not an enemy, however much we suffer in [20]  the process. Shakespeare writes: \"Sweet are the uses  of adversity.\" Jesus said: \"Blessed are ye, when men  shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all  manner of evil against you _falsely_, for my sake; ... for  so persecuted they the prophets which were before [25]  you.\"    The Hebrew law with its \"Thou shalt not,\" its de-  mand and sentence, can only be fulfilled through the  gospel's benediction. Then, \"Blessed are ye,\" inso-    [Page 9.]    much as the consciousness of good, grace, and peace, [1]  comes through affliction rightly understood, as sanctified  by the purification it brings to the flesh,--to pride, self-  ignorance, self-will, self-love, self-justification. Sweet,  indeed, are these uses of His rod! Well is it that the [5]  Shepherd of Israel passes all His flock under His rod  into His fold; thereby numbering them, and giving them  refuge at last from the elements of earth.    \"Love thine enemies\" is identical with \"Thou hast  no enemies.\" Wherein is this conclusion relative to [10]  those who have hated thee without a cause? Simply, in  that those unfortunate individuals are virtually thy best  friends. Primarily and ultimately, they are doing thee  good far beyond the present sense which thou canst entertain  of good. [15]    Whom we call friends seem to sweeten life's cup and  to fill it with the nectar of the gods. We lift this cup  to our lips; but it slips from our grasp, to fall in frag-  ments before our eyes. Perchance, having tasted its  tempting wine, we become intoxicated; become lethar- [20]  gic, dreamy objects of self-satisfaction; else, the con-  tents of this cup of selfish human enjoyment having lost  its flavor, we voluntarily set it aside as tasteless and  unworthy of human aims.    And wherefore our failure longer to relish this fleet- [25]  ing sense, with its delicious forms of friendship,  wherewith mortals become educated to gratification in  personal pleasure and trained in treacherous peace?  Because it is the great and only danger in the path  that winds upward. A false sense of what consti- [30]  tutes happiness is more disastrous to human progress  than all that an enemy or enmity can obtrude upon    [Page 10.]    the mind or engraft upon its purposes and achievements [1]  wherewith to obstruct life's joys and enhance its sor-  rows.    We have no enemies. Whatever envy, hatred, revenge  --the most remorseless motives that govern mortal mind [5]  --whatever these try to do, shall \"work together for good  to them that love God.\"    Why?    Because He has called His own, armed them, equipped  them, and furnished them defenses impregnable. Their [10]  God will not let them be lost; and if they fall they shall  rise again, stronger than before the stumble. The good  cannot lose their God, their help in times of trouble.  If they mistake the divine command, they will recover  it, countermand their order, retrace their steps, and [15]  reinstate His orders, more assured to press on safely.  The best lesson of their lives is gained by crossing  swords with temptation, with fear and the besetments  of evil; insomuch as they thereby have tried their  strength and proven it; insomuch as they have found [20]  their strength made perfect in weakness, and their fear  is self-immolated.    This destruction is a moral chemicalization, wherein  old things pass away and all things become new. The  worldly or material tendencies of human affections and [25]  pursuits are thus annihilated; and this is the advent of  spiritualization. Heaven comes down to earth, and  mortals learn at last the lesson, \"I have no enemies.\"    Even in belief you have but one (that, not in reality),  and this one enemy is yourself--your erroneous belief [30]  that you have enemies; that evil is real; that aught but  good exists in Science. Soon or late, your enemy will    [Page 11.]    wake from his delusion to suffer for his evil intent; to [1]  find that, though thwarted, its punishment is tenfold.    Love is the fulfilling of the law: it is grace, mercy,  and justice. I used to think it sufficiently just to abide  by our State statutes; that if a man should aim a ball at [5]  my heart, and I by firing first could kill him and save  my own life, that this was right. I thought, also, that  if I taught indigent students gratuitously, afterwards  assisting them pecuniarily, and did not cease teachi  ing the wayward ones at close of the class term, but [10]  followed them with precept upon precept; that if my  instructions had healed them and shown them the sure way  of salvation,--I had done my whole duty to students.    Love metes not out human justice, but divine mercy.  If one's life were attacked, and one could save it only [15]  in accordance with common law, by taking another's,  would one sooner give up his own? We must love our  enemies in all the manifestations wherein and whereby  we love our friends; must even try not to expose their  faults, but to do them good whenever opportunity [20]  occurs. To mete out human justice to those who per-  secure and despitefully use one, is not leaving all retribu-  tion to God and returning blessing for cursing. If special  opportunity for doing good to one's enemies occur not,  one can include them in his general effort to benefit the [25]  race. Because I can do much general good to such as  hate me, I do it with earnest, special care--since they  permit me no other way, though with tears have I striven  for it. When smitten on one cheek, I have turned the  other: I have but two to present. [30]    I would enjoy taking by the hand all who love me not,  and saying to them, \"_I_ love _you_, and would not know-    [Page 12.]    ingly harm you.\" _Because_ I thus feel, I say to others: [1]  Hate no one; for hatred is a plague-spot that spreads  its virus and kills at last. If indulged, it masters us;  brings suffering upon suffering to its possessor, through-  out time and beyond the grave. If you have been badly [5]  wronged, forgive and forget: God will recompense this  wrong, and punish, more severely than you could, him  who has striven to injure you. Never return evil for evil;  and, above all, do not fancy that you have been wronged  when you have not been. [10]    The present is ours; the future, big with events.  Every man and woman should be to-day a law to him-  self, herself,--a law of loyalty to Jesus' Sermon on the  Mount. The means for sinning unseen and unpunished  have so increased that, unless one be watchful and stead- [15]  fast in Love, one's temptations to sin are increased a  hundredfold. Mortal"]]]
