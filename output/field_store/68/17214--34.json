Arriving at Hainburg, he heard from the local pastor of  Haydn's \"weak but pleasing voice,\" and immediately had the young singer  before him.    A Musical Examination    The story of the examination is rather amusing. Reutter gave the little  fellow a canon to sing at first sight. The boy went though the thing  triumphantly, and the delighted Reutter cried \"Bravo!\" as he flung a  handful of cherries into Haydn's cap. But there was one point on which  Reutter was not quite satisfied. \"How is it, my little man,\" he said,  \"that you cannot shake?\" \"How can you expect me to shake,\" replied the  enfant terrible, \"when Herr Frankh himself cannot shake?\" The great  man was immensely tickled by the ready retort, and, drawing the child  towards him, he taught him how to make the vibrations in his throat  required to produce the ornament. The boy picked up the trick at once.  It was the final decision of his fate. Reutter saw that here was a  recruit worth having, and he lost no time in getting the parents'  sanction to carry him off to Vienna. In the father's case this was  easily managed, but the mother only yielded when it was pointed out that  her son's singing in the cathedral choir did not necessarily mean the  frustration of her hopes of seeing him made a priest.    Goes to Vienna    Thus, some time in the year 1740, Reutter marched away from Hainburg  with the little Joseph, and Hainburg knew the little Joseph no more.  Vienna was now to be his home for ten long years of dreary pupilage  and genteel starvation. In those days, and for long after, St Stephen's  Cathedral was described as \"the first church in the empire,\" and it is  still, with its magnificent spire, the most important edifice in Vienna.  Erected in 1258 and 1276 on the site of a church dating from 1144,  it was not finally completed until 1446. It is in the form of a Latin  cross, and is 355 feet long. The roof is covered with coloured tiles,  and the rich groined vaulting is borne by eighteen massive pillars,  adorned with more than a hundred statuettes. Since 1852 the building  has been thoroughly restored, but in all essentials it remains as it was  when Haydn sang in it as a choir-boy.    The Choir School of St Stephen's    Many interesting details have been printed regarding the Choir School  of St Stephen's and its routine in Haydn's time. They have been well  summarized by one of his biographers. [See Miss Townsend's Haydn, p. 9.]  The Cantorei was of very ancient foundation. Mention is made of it as  early as 1441, and its constitution may be gathered from directions  given regarding it about the period 1558-1571. It was newly constituted  in 1663, and many alterations were made then and afterwards, but in  Haydn's day it was still practically what it had been for nearly a  century before. The school consisted of a cantor (made Capellmeister  in 1663), a sub-cantor, two ushers and six scholars. They all resided  together, and had meals in common; and although ample allowance  had originally been made for the board, lodging and clothing of the  scholars, the increased cost of living resulted in the boys of Haydn's  time being poorly fed and scantily clad. They were instructed in  \"religion and Latin, together with the ordinary subjects of school  education, and in music, the violin, clavier, and singing.\" The younger  scholars were taken in hand by those more advanced. The routine would  seem to us now to be somewhat severe. There were two full choral  services daily in the cathedral. Special Te Deums were constantly sung,  and the boys had to take part in the numerous solemn processions of  religious brotherhoods through the city, as well as in the services for  royal birthdays and other such occasions. During Holy Week the labours  of the choir were continuous. Children's processions were very frequent,  and Haydn's delight in after years at the performance of the charity  children in St Paul's may have been partly owing to the reminiscences of  early days which it awakened.    A House of Suffering    But these details are aside from our main theme. The chapel-house of St  Stephen's was now the home of our little Joseph. It ought to have been  a happy home of instruction, but it was, alas! a house of suffering.  Reutter did not devote even ordinary care to his pupil, and from casual  lessons in musical theory he drifted into complete neglect. Haydn  afterwards declared that he had never had more than two lessons in  composition from Reutter, who was, moreover, harsh and cruel and  unfeeling, laughing at his pupil's groping attempts, and chastising him  on the slightest pretext. It has been hinted that the Capellmeister was  jealous of his young charge--that he was \"afraid of finding a rival in  the pupil.\" But this is highly improbable. Haydn had not as yet shown  any unusual gifts likely to excite the envy of his superior. There is  more probability in the other suggestion that Reutter was piqued at not  having been allowed by Haydn's father to perpetuate the boy's fine voice  by the ancient method of emasculation. The point, in any case, is not  of very much importance. It is sufficient to observe that Reutter's name  survives mainly in virtue of the fact that he tempted Haydn to Vienna  with the promise of special instruction, and gave him practically  nothing of that, but a great deal of ill-usage.    Lessons at St Stephen's    Haydn was supposed to have lessons from two undistinguished professors  named Gegenbauer and Finsterbusch. But it all amounted to very little.  There was the regular drilling for the church services, to be sure:  solfeggi and psalms, psalms and solfeggi--always apt to degenerate,  under a pedant, into the dreariest of mechanical routine. How many a  sweet-voiced chorister, even in our own days, reaches manhood with a  love for music? It needs music in his soul. Haydn's soul withstood the  numbing influence of pedantry. He realized that it lay with himself  to develop and nurture the powers within his breast of which he was  conscious. \"The talent was in me,\" he remarked, \"and by dint of hard  work I managed to get on.\" Shortly before his death, when he happened to  be in Vienna for some church festival, he had an opportunity of speaking  to the choir-boys of that time. \"I was once a singing boy,\" he said.  \"Reutter brought me from Hainburg to Vienna. I was industrious when my  companions were at play. I used to take my little clavier under my arm,  and go off to practice undisturbed. When I sang a solo, the baker near  St Stephen's yonder always gave me a cake as a present. Be good and  industrious, and serve God continually.\"    A Sixteen-Part Mass!    It is pathetic to think of the boy assiduously scratching innumerable  notes on scraps of music paper, striving with yet imperfect knowledge  to express himself, and hoping that by some miracle of inspiration  something like music might come out of it. \"I thought it must be all  right if the paper was nice and full,\" he said. He even went the length  of trying to write a mass in sixteen parts--an effort which Reutter  rewarded with a shrug and a sneer, and the sarcastic suggestion that for  the present two parts might be deemed sufficient, and that he had better  perfect his copying of music before trying to compose it. But Haydn was  not to be snubbed and snuffed out in this way. He appealed to his father  for money to buy some theory books. There was not too much money at  Rohrau, we may be sure, for the family was always increasing, and petty  economies were necessary. But the wheelwright managed to send the boy  six florins, and that sum was immediately expended on Fux's Gradus  ad Parnassum and Mattheson's Volkommener Capellmeister--heavy, dry  treatises both, which have long since gone to the musical antiquary's  top shelf among the dust and the cobwebs. These \"dull and verbose  dampers to enthusiasm\" Haydn made his constant companions, in default of  a living instructor, and, like Longfellow's \"great men,\" toiled upwards  in the night, while less industrious mortals snored.    Juvenile Escapades    Meanwhile his native exuberance and cheerfulness of soul were  irrepressible. Several stories are told of the schoolboy escapades he  enjoyed with his fellow choristers. One will suffice here. He used to  boast that he had sung with success at Court as well as in St Stephen's.  This meant that he had made one of the choir when visits were paid to  the Palace of Schonbrunn, where the Empress Maria and her Court resided.  On the occasion of one of these visits the palace was in the hands of  the builders, and the scaffolding presented the usual temptation to the  youngsters. \"The empress,\" to quote Pohl, \"had caught them climbing it  many a time, but her threats and prohibitions had no effect. One day  when Haydn was balancing himself aloft, far above his schoolfellows,  the empress saw him from the windows, and requested her Hofcompositor to  take care that 'that fair-headed blockhead,' the ringleader of them all,  got 'einen recenten Schilling' (slang for 'a good hiding').\" The command  was only too willingly obeyed by the obsequious Reutter, who by this  time had been ennobled, and rejoiced in the addition of \"von\" to his  name. Many years afterwards, when the empress was on a visit to Prince  Esterhazy, the \"fair-headed blockhead\" took the cruel delight of  thanking her for this rather questionable mark of Imperial favour!    \"Sang like a Crow\"    As a matter of fact, the empress, however she may have thought of Haydn  the man, showed herself anything but considerate to Haydn the choir-boy.  The future composer's younger brother, Michael, had now arrived in  Vienna, and had been admitted to the St Stephen's choir. His voice is  said to have been \"stronger and of better quality\" than Joseph's, which  had almost reached the \"breaking\" stage; and the empress, complaining to  Reutter that Joseph \"san"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37901"],[0,"Profitable Squab Breeding (#3)"],[1," by rats or mice, or when cooped and  shipped with a number of other birds in small shipping coops.      [Illustration: Pure White Maltese Hen Pigeon.]    When a pair have gone through the courting stage and have mated ready to  build a nest and hatch young, they remain true to each other as long as  they live, or as long as they are allowed to remain together. If a  mating is broken by death or separation, the birds will mate with other  birds. This rule of constancy is rarely broken and may generally be  depended upon.    Some pigeon books say that a beginner can do as well with the common  pigeons that fly about the streets as with the straight Homers. This  statement is absurd on the face of it. The common pigeon has bred  indiscriminately and inbred until the squab produced by it is thin,  light in weight, skinny and dark fleshed to such a degree that they sell  for about $1.50 a dozen in the markets. Most people would willingly pay  three times that for the plump, meaty squabs from straight American bred  Homers.    The beginner who secures the right kind of stock has made the first long  step toward success as a squab-breeder and he should not hesitate to pay  the price which good breeding stock is worth, for poor breeding stock  means failure and loss in the end.    Your success depends upon the stock you buy. It is much better to buy  good stock at a fair price than it is to get poor stock for nothing. No  man can tell by looking at a lot of breeding pigeons whether they are  good breeders or not. No man can tell whether they will produce squabs  with white flesh or dark, squabs that will weigh ten pounds to the dozen  or six pounds. No one can even guess at the age of a pair of pigeons and  those which are old and worn out look just as nice as those which are  only a year old.    The whole future of the beginner depends upon getting stock which is  right in every way. Imported birds are usually of all ages and  qualities. American-bred birds, if bought of a reputable breeder, may be  depended upon to produce a large proportion of heavy, light-fleshed  squabs and properly selected and mated pairs will go to work and breed  regularly as soon as they have become accustomed to their new home. For  these reasons I would not advise the purchase of imported birds except  on rare occasions after carefully investigating the stock and the  circumstances of their importation.      [Illustration: Fig. 2. Showing a Well Arranged Squab Plant of Moderate    Size With Colony Coop for Poultry in the Foreground.]          CHAPTER III    The Construction of Houses    PIGEON HOUSE PLANS--NESTS--WATER FOUNTAINS--BATHING DISHES--KEEPING THE  HOUSE IN SANITARY CONDITION      No doubt many a person has been deterred from making a start in the  business of raising squabs on account of the fancied expense of building  suitable houses. No one should make the mistake of thinking that a  costly house is necessary. To be sure a well built, nicely painted house  is ornamental and adds to the appearance of a squab-breeding plant; but  this will come before long if the beginner has the proper qualifications  and the ability to increase the size of his flock as rapidly as he may  with good care and attention to his business.    The writer has traveled all over the great squab-breeding sections of  the East and West and found about every kind of a pigeon house that the  ingenuity of man has ever been able to build. We have seen houses which  cost thousands of dollars and those which were built of the odd boards  that were picked up about the farm. We have seen as fine birds and as  large squabs in a house improvised from piano boxes as we ever saw in  any of the great squab-breeding plants.    It is not so much a question of looks in a house as it is of comfort and  good care. One of the finest squab-breeding plants in this country has  grown up from a few birds which were housed at first in a corner of the  barn. The owner persevered and kept adding to his flock as he made money  from it, and he now has fine buildings and thousands of birds, all  earned from an initial investment of something like $25. Not a cent was  ever added to the original investment, all the increase and improvement  in buildings having been paid for out of the earnings of the birds  themselves.    Before we go further, let us say that the pigeon-breeders do not talk  about pigeon houses. A house or room in which pigeons are kept is called  a \"loft,\" whether it is on the ground floor or in the peak of a barn.  The pigeon house is a loft and the flock of pigeons kept in a loft is  called a loft of pigeons. It is just as well to get the proper terms  used in the business at first, as pigeon-breeders always use them. To  return to our pigeon loft. A loft may be made in the corner of a stable  or other out-house, with a fly outside. We might explain for the  benefit of the beginner that a pigeon \"fly\" is a wired-in yard, a sort  of big cage in which the pigeons are kept within limits. The flies are  made by setting up posts about eight feet high and stretching two-inch  mesh poultry netting on them. A fly is usually about ten feet wide and  from twelve to thirty feet long. This is covered over the top with the  same kind of poultry netting that is used on the sides.      [Illustration: Fig. 3. Showing End View of House No. 1.]    We have seen as good pigeon lofts as any one would need made in the loft  of a stable, the fly being on the roof. Posts were so set up on the roof  that their tops were even with the peak of the roof. The enclosure was  then shut in, sides and top, with poultry netting and the birds had a  roomy and dry fly which was always clean, as the rains washed the  droppings off the roof at frequent intervals.    In Chicago, we saw an extensive pigeon loft on the top of a flat-topped  building high above the street; and a very well-known squab breeding  establishment in a southern state is on top of a big hotel, the owner  breeding the squabs he needs for his hotel in this high-placed  situation.    From the foregoing it will be seen that the question of housing the  breeding pigeons is not a very complicated one, as there is a wide  latitude for action.    Some breeders even allow their birds to fly at large not using flies at  all; but this practice is not recommended. In the first place, the birds  do not produce so many squabs as they do under confinement and they are  liable to accidents, such as being caught by hawks, shot by boys, or  some other mishap which causes the owner to lose them and often lose  squabs which such birds have in their nests.    It has been found best to keep the birds strictly confined. One  well-known squab-raiser has a pen of fifty pairs of birds in his lofts  which have been confined in the same place for seven years and are still  working well. The writer visited this loft at the end of the seventh  year of their confinement and noticed that they were producing squabs at  a good rate.    For the convenience of beginners, we give ground plan and elevation of  two styles of pigeon lofts. The loft designed as No. 1, may be built at  a cost as low as $15.00, for one room, or it may be made to cost $50 or  even more. It will be seen that the plan is for two rooms, but this is  not the limit of size that is possible. We have seen lofts with a dozen  rooms in them, but would recommend about four rooms as the most  convenient limit where pigeons are kept extensively. Where a four-room  house is built for lofting purposes, the plan should include a storeroom  unless the owner has a room which conveniently can be used for a  storeroom for feed and as a place for dressing and packing the squabs.    In House No. 2, it will be seen that an alleyway is built in the house  back of the lofts. The partition between this alleyway and the lofts is  made of two-inch poultry netting, but the partitions between the rooms  are solid and as air tight as the outside walls.    A good many breeders are now using stout muslin instead of glass in the  windows, as this gives light, lets the warmth of the sun enter the rooms  and provides a good system of ventilation. Houses in which cloth windows  are used are found to be fully as warm as those having glass windows.    On the side of the house next the fly, a series of openings is made near  the roof, but low enough to open under the top of the fly. These  openings may be about eight inches square with a six-inch wide shelf  even with the bottom inside and outside. These are the doors through  which the pigeons go back and forth to and from the fly, and the shelves  beneath them are the lighting perches. These openings should be provided  with a sliding door so that they can be closed when it is desirable to  shut out the cold or to confine the birds for any reason.      NESTS    In providing nests for a loft, at least two nests for each pair of birds  should be provided. This gives the birds a chance to build a new nest to  use while the squabs are maturing in another, as after the birds begin  to breed they will have eggs in one nest while they have a pair of  squabs in another. Some breeders provide 120 nests for fifty pairs of  birds, but this is rather more than is necessary.    The nest boxes are easily made. The illustration on page 21 shows very  clearly the manner of constructing them. In practice, boards one foot  wide on which cleats one inch square are nailed across, one foot apart,  are set against the wall in perpendicular lines one foot apart and  firmly secured, the edge being to the wall, of course. This leaves the  cleats opposite each other. Then boards one foot square are cut and  laid on these cleats. When the work is done, we have a series of nests  one foot every way, each shelf forming the bottom of a nest and the top  of the one under it. If nappies are not used, a cleat should be nailed  on the front edge of the shelves in order that the nesting will not be  worked"]]]
