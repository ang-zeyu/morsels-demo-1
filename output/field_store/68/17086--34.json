Douglas Company,  Middletown, Connecticut,[3] in the 1830's. Middletown, at that time one  of the leading metal-working centers in one of the chief industrial  States, had been for many years the site of the Simeon North arms  factory which rivaled Whitney's. In this atmosphere, it is reasonable to  expect that machinery constructed by local mechanics, as was the custom  in those days, would reflect the most accepted refinements in machine  design.    [Illustration: Figure 12.--WELL-DEVELOPED EXAMPLE of lathe headstock  having several leads on the spindle and provision for mounting the work  or a work-holding chuck on the spindle. Adapted from _L'Encyclopedie_,  vol. 10, plate 13.]    [Illustration: Figure 13.--END VIEW OF THE HEADSTOCK seen in figure 12,  showing the keys or half nuts which engage the threaded spindle, in  engaged and disengaged positions.

Note the  scale of feet. From _L'Encyclopedie_, vol. 10, plate 16.]    Roughly twenty years later, Joseph Nason of New York patented[4] the  commercially very important \"Fox\" brassworker's lathe (fig. 18). While  this does have a ratio in the pair of gears connecting the work spindle  and master screw, it is clear from the patent that various pitches are  to be obtained by changing screws, not by changing gears. The patent  sums it up as follows:         A nut upon the end of the stud ... is unscrewed when the guide       screw is to be removed or changed. The two wheels ... should have       in their number of teeth a common multiple. They are seldom or       never removed and their diameters are made dissimilar only for the       purpose of giving to the guide screw a slower rate of motion than       that of the mandrel whereby it may be made of coarser pitch than       that of the screw to be cut and its wear materially lessened.    The introduction of gearing between the spindle and the lead screw, for  whatever purpose, could not help but introduce variable factors caused  by inaccuracies in the gears themselves and in their mounting. These  were of little consequence for common work, particularly when coupled to  a screw which, itself, was of questionable accuracy. The increasing  refinements demanded in scientific instruments and in machine tools  themselves after they had reached a relatively stable form dictated that  attention be dedicated to improved accuracy of the threaded components.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--MAUDSLAY'S WELL-KNOWN screw-cutting lathe of  1797-1800, showing the method of mounting and driving changeable master  screws.

The nut may be brought into engagement by the lever at  top rear of the headstock. This releases the end thrust control on the  spindle simultaneously with engagement of the nut.

Note the ready facility with  which the lead screw may be exchanged for another and the same means of  supporting and driving as in figure 15. (U.S. National Archives photo.)]    An attack on this problem, which interestingly reverts to the  fundamental principle of motion derived from a master screw without the  intervention of other mechanism (fig. 19), is covered by a patent[5]  issued to Charles Vander Woerd, one-time superintendent of the Waltham  Watch Company. The problem is well stated in the patent:         This invention relates to the manufacture of leading screws to be       used for purposes requiring the highest attainable degree of       correctness in the cutting of the screw-threads of said screw ...       as, for example, in machines for ruling lines in glass plates to       produce refraction [sic] gratings for the resolution of the lines       of the solar spectrum, such machines being required to rule many       thousands of lines on an inch of space by a marking device which is       reciprocated over the glass plate and is fed by the action of a       leading screw after the formation of each line. Great difficulty       has been experienced in constructing a leading screw for this and       other purposes, in which the thread is so nearly correct as to       produce no perceptible variation in the microscopic spaces between       the ruled lines or gratings.... Various causes prevent the       formation of a thread on the rod or blank, which is absolutely       uniform and accurate from end to end of the rod. Among other causes       are the variations of temperature from time to time, the       imperfections of the operating leading screw, the springing of the       leading screw and of the rod that is being threaded, and other       unavoidable causes, all of which, although apparently trivial and       producing only slight variations in the thread at different parts       of the rod or blank, are of sufficient moment to be seriously       considered when a screw of absolute accuracy is desired.    [Illustration: Figure 18.--NASON'S LATHE, patented in 1854, showing a  master lead screw driven at less than work speed so that the master  could be of a coarser and more durable pitch than the work. U.S. patent  10383.]    It is interesting to note in figure 19 that Vander Woerd's machine, to  avoid the problems outlined in his patent, has returned to a starkly  simple design. We are not told, however, how he originated this master  screw which is used to produce the accurately threaded work pieces.  Later generations, in the search for ever-greater accuracy, also  returned to the fundamental simplicity of a master screw as we shall see  when we consider the refinements in mechanism necessary to the extended  development of the automobile and the airplane.    [Illustration: Figure 19.--VANDER WOERD'S PATENT, seen here, covered the  combination of a master screw, toolslide and work in a rigid frame to be  supported and driven by outside means of no required precision. U.S.  patent 293930 dated February 1884.]    As the power and speed of automobiles and aircraft increased, critical  parts became more highly stressed. Gears and threaded parts were  particularly troublesome details of the mechanism because of the  stresses concentrated in them, and, in the case of gears, because of the  internal and external stresses originating in minute deviations from the  ideal of tooth form and spacing. The problems were not entirely new but  had hitherto been solved by increasing the size of the parts, an avenue  of limited utility to designers in these fields where total weight as  well as the effects of mass and inertia are so important. By making  these parts of heat-treated steel, the strength could be made suitable  while the size and mass of the parts were kept within bounds. The  necessary processes of heat-treating were not always applicable to  finished parts as they sometimes destroyed both finish and accuracy.  Grinding, which was well developed for the simple plane, cylindrical,  and conical surfaces so widely used in mechanisms, had to be extended to  threads and gears so that they could be finished after heat-treating.  Sometimes the gear teeth themselves were ground; for other applications  it was sufficient to improve the accuracy of the gear cutters.    [Illustration: Figure 20.--A HOB-GRINDING MACHINE patented in 1932 and  incorporating the master-screw principle. Carl G. Olson's U.S. patent  1874592.]    Attempts to produce gear hobs free of the imperfections and distortions  introduced by heat treatment led to another return to the use of the  master lead screw. Figure 20 illustrates a machine having this feature  which was patented in 1932 by Carl G. Olson.[6] In speaking of the  spindle-driving mechanism disclosed in earlier patents, the patent goes  on to say:         This driving mechanism includes an integral spindle 20, one       extremity thereof being designed for supporting a hob 22 and the       other extremity thereof being formed so as to present a lead screw       24. The spindle 20 is mounted between a bearing 26 and a bearing       28, the latter bearing providing a nut in which the lead screw 24       rotates.... From the description thus far given it will be apparent       that the rotation of the lead screw 24 within the bearing or nut 28       will cause the hob to be moved axially, the lead of the screw 24       being equal to the lead of the thread in the hob.    Claim 8 which concludes the descriptive portion of the patent states in  part:         In a hob grinding machine of the class described, a rotary work       supporting spindle, means for effecting longitudinal movement of       the spindle, a tool holder for supporting a grinding wheel in       operative position with respect to the work supported by the       spindle during the rotary and longitudinal movement thereof, ...    Even before this patent was applied for, another patent was pending for  the purpose of modifying the pitch of the lead screw without the use of  change gears in spite of the wide acceptance of such gear mechanisms for  over a hundred years.    [Illustration: Figure 21.--A HOB-GRINDING MACHINE OF 1933, showing use  of the master screw with a modifier but without change gears. Carl G.

Suppose a theatrical situation in which a  convivial company is passing at night and disappears from view, while in  the foreground a silent, envenomed duel is in progress. Here the music,  by means of continuing song, should keep in mind the jovial company now  lost to sight; the acts and feelings of the pair in the foreground may  be understood without further commentary, and the music--dramatically  speaking--ought not to participate in their action and break the tragic  silence.    Measurably justified, in my opinion, is the plan of the old opera, which  concentrated and musically rounded out the passions aroused by a moving  dramatic scene in a piece of set form (the aria). _Word_ and stage-play  conveyed the dramatic progress of the action, followed more or less  meagrely by musical recitative; arrived at the point of rest, music  resumed the reins. This is less extrinsic than some would now have us  believe. On the other hand, it was the ossified form of the \"aria\"  itself which led to inveracity of expression and decadence.                               *       *       *    THE audible presentation, the \"performance,\" of music, its _emotional  interpretation_, derives from those free heights whence descended the  Art itself. Where the art is threatened by earthliness, it is the part  of interpretation to raise it and reëndow it with its primordial  essence.    Notation, the writing out of compositions, is primarily an ingenious  expedient for catching an inspiration, with the purpose of exploiting it  later. But notation is to improvisation as the portrait to the living  model. It is for the interpreter to _resolve the rigidity of the signs_  into the primitive emotion.    But the lawgivers require the interpreter to reproduce the rigidity of  the signs; they consider his reproduction the nearer to perfection, the  more closely it clings to the signs.--    What the composer's inspiration _necessarily_ loses[H] through notation,  his interpreter should restore by his own.      [H] How strongly notation influences style in music, and fetters    imagination, how \"form\" grew up out of it and from form arose    \"conventionalism\" in expression, is shown very convincingly and    avenges itself in tragic wise in E. T. A. Hoffmann, who occurs to me    here as a typical example.      This remarkable man's mental conceptions, lost in visionary moods    and revelling in transcendentalism, as his writings set forth in oft    inimitable fashion, must naturally--so one would infer--have found in    the dreamlike and transcendental art of tones a language and mode of    expression peculiarly congenial.      The veil of mysticism, the secret harmonies of Nature, the thrill of    the supernatural, the twilight vagueness of the borderland of dreams,    everything, in fact, which he so effectively limned with the precision    of _words_--all this, one would suppose, he could have interpreted to    fullest effect by the aid of music. And yet, comparing Hoffmann's best    musical work with the weakest of his literary productions, you will    discover to your sorrow how a conventional system of measures, periods    and keys--whereto the hackneyed opera-style of the time adds its    share--could turn a poet into a Philistine. But that his fancy    cherished another ideal of music, we learn from many, and frequently    admirable, observations of Hoffmann the _littérateur_.    To the lawgivers, the signs themselves are the most important matter,  and are continually growing in their estimation; the new art of music is  derived from the old signs--_and these now stand for musical art  itself_.    If the lawgivers had their way, any given composition would always be  reproduced in precisely the same tempo, whensoever, by whomsoever, and  under whatsoever conditions it might be performed.    But, it _is_ not possible; the buoyant, expansive nature of the divine  child rebels--it demands the opposite. Each day begins differently from  the preceding, yet always with the flush of dawn.--Great artists play  their own works differently at each repetition, remodel them on the spur  of the moment, accelerate and retard, in a way which they could not  indicate by signs--and always according to the given conditions of that  \"eternal harmony.\"    And then the lawgiver chafes, and refers the creator to his own  handwriting. As matters stand to-day, the lawgiver has the best of the  argument.                               *       *       *    \"Notation\" (\"writing down\") brings up the subject of Transcription,  nowadays a term much misunderstood, almost discreditable. The frequent  antagonism which I have excited with \"transcriptions,\" and the  opposition to which an ofttimes irrational criticism has provoked me,  caused me to seek a clear understanding of this point. My final  conclusion concerning it is this: Every notation is, in itself, the  transcription of an abstract idea. The instant the pen seizes it, the  idea loses its original form. The very intention to write down the idea,  compels a choice of measure and key. The form, and the musical agency,  which the composer must decide upon, still more closely define the way  and the limits.    It is much the same as with man himself. Born naked, and as yet without  definite aspirations, he decides, or at a given moment is made to  decide, upon a career. From the moment of decision, although much that  is original and imperishable in the idea or the man may live on, either  is depressed to the type of a class. The musical idea becomes a sonata  or a concerto; the man, a soldier or a priest. That is an Arrangement of  the original. From this first transcription to a second the step is  comparatively short and unimportant. And yet it is only the second, in  general, of which any notice is taken; overlooking the fact, that a  transcription does not destroy the archetype, which is, therefore, not  lost through transcription.    Again, the performance of a work is also a transcription, and still,  whatever liberties it may take, it can never annihilate the original.    For the musical art-work exists, before its tones resound and after they  die away, _complete and intact_. It exists both within and outside of  time, and through its nature we can obtain a definite conception of the  otherwise intangible notion of the Ideality of Time.    For the rest, most of Beethoven's piano compositions sound like  transcriptions of orchestral works; most of Schumann's orchestral  compositions, like arrangements from pieces for the piano--and they are  so, in a way.                               *       *       *    Strangely enough, the Variation-Form is highly esteemed by the Worshippers  of the Letter. That is singular; for the variation-form--when built up  on a borrowed theme--produces a _whole series of \"arrangements\"_ which,  besides, are least respectful when most ingenious.    So the arrangement is _not_ good, because it _varies_ the original; and  the variation _is_ good, although it \"_arranges_\" the original.                               *       *       *    THE term \"musikalisch\" (musical) is used by the Germans in a sense  foreign to that in which any other language employs it.[I] It is a  conception belonging to the Germans, and not to culture in general; the  expression is incorrect and untranslatable. \"Musical\" is derived from  _music_, like \"poetical\" from _poetry_, or \"physical\" from _physic(s)_.  When I say, \"Schubert was one of the most musical among men,\" it is the  same as if I should say, \"Helmholtz was one of the most physical among  men.\" That is musical, which _sounds_ in rhythms and intervals. A  cupboard can be \"musical,\" if \"music-works\" be enclosed in it.[J] In a  comparative sense, \"musical\" may have the further signification of  \"euphonious.\"--\"My verses are too musical to bear setting to music,\" a  noted poet once remarked to me.      [I] The author probably had in mind the languages of southern Europe;    the word is employed in English, and in the tongues of the    Scandinavian group, with precisely the same meaning as in German.    [Translator's Note.]      [J] The only kind of people one might properly call _musical_, are the    singers; for they themselves can sound. Similarly, a clown who by some    trick produces tones when he is touched, might be called a    _pseudo-musical_ person.        \"Spirits moving musically       To a lute's well-tuned law,\"    writes Edgar Allan Poe. Lastly, one may speak quite correctly of  \"musical laughter,\" because it _sounds_ like music.    Taking the signification in which the term is applied and almost  exclusively employed in German, a musical person is one who manifests an  inclination for music by a nice discrimination and sensitiveness with  regard to the _technical aspects_ of the art. By \"technics\" I mean  rhythm, harmony, intonation, part-leading, and the treatment of themes.  The more subtleties he is capable of hearing or reproducing in these,  the more \"musical\" he is held to be.    In view of the great importance attached to these elements of the art,  this \"musical\" temperament has naturally become of the highest  consequence. And so an artist who plays with perfect technical finish  should be deemed the most musical player. But as we mean by \"technics\"  only the mechanical mastery of the instrument, the terms \"technical\"  and \"musical\" have been turned into opposites.    The matter has been carried so far as to call a composition itself  \"musical,\"[K] or even to assert of a great composer like Berlioz that he  was not sufficiently musical.[L] \"Unmusical\" conveys the strongest  reproach; branded thus, its object becomes an outlaw.[M]   "]]]
