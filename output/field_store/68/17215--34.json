Its entire cost is from $125 to $200,  according to size. It will be a shame to American agricultural enterprise  if flax-cotton and linen are not both among our country's extensive and  important products within the next three years.    The department of Agricultural Machinery and Implements was decidedly the  most interesting of any. No other can at all equal it in the rapidity and  universality of progress from year to year. Of Plows, there cannot have  been less than two hundred on the ground, exhibiting a great variety of  novel excellence. One with two shares, contrived to cut two furrows at  once, seemed the most useful of any recently invented. The upper share cuts  and turns the sward to the depth of five inches, which is immediately  buried seven inches deep by the earth turned up by the deeper share. Since  it is impossible to induce one farmer in twenty to subsoil, this, as the  next best thing, ought to be universally adopted.    Seed-Sowers, Corn-Planters, Reapers, Fanning-Mills, Straw-Cutters, &c.,  &c., were abundant, and evinced many improvements on the best of former  years. A Mower with which a man, boy, and span of horses, will cut and  spread ten acres per day of grass, however heavy, on tolerably level  land--both cutting and spreading better than the hand-impelled scythe and  stick will do--was among the new inventions; also two threshers and  cleaners, each of them warranted to thresh and nearly clean, by the labor  of four men, a boy, and two horses, over one hundred bushels of wheat or  two hundred bushels of oats per day. The testimony of candid citizens who  had used them, and the evidence of our own senses, left no doubt on our  mind of the correctness of these assertions. But we do not write to commend  any article, but to call attention to the great and cheering truth which  underlies them all. Agriculture is a noble art, involving the knowledge of  almost all the practical sciences--chemistry, geology, climatology,  mechanics, &c. It is not merely progressive, but rapidly progressing, so  that fifty days' labor on the same soil produce far more grain or hay now  than they did half a century ago. And every year is increasing and  rendering more palpable the pressing need of a PRACTICAL COLLEGE, wherein  Agriculture, Mechanics, and the sciences auxiliary thereto shall be ably  and thoroughly taught to thousands and tens of thousands of our countrymen,  who shall in turn become the disseminators of the truths thus inculcated to  the youth of every county and township in the country.    And thus shall Agriculture be rendered what it should be--not only the most  essential but the most intellectual and attractive among the industrial  avocations of mankind.                                  HORACE GREELEY    [Illustration: THE VIRGINIA REAPER.    _Exhibited at the Crystal Palace, and the New-York State Agricultural Fair,  by Cyrus H. McCormick_.]          WILLIAM ROSS WALLACE.    [Illustration]      Of the large number of young men in this country who write verses, we  scarcely know of one who has a more unquestionable right to the title of  poet than WILLIAM ROSS WALLACE, who has just published, in a very handsome  volume, a collection of his writings, under the title of _Meditations in  America_. Mr. WALLACE has written other things which in their day have been  sufficiently familiar to the public; in what we have to say of his  capacities we shall confine ourselves to the pieces which he has himself  here selected as the truest exponents of his genius, and without giving  them indiscriminate praise shall hope to find in them evidences of peculiar  and remarkable powers, combined with a spirit eminently susceptible to the  influences of nature and of ideal and moral beauty.    Mr. Wallace is a western man, and was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in the  year 1819. His father was a Presbyterian minister, of good family, and  marked abilities, who died soon after, leaving the future poet to the care  of a mother whose chief ambition in regard to him was that he should be so  trained as to be capable of the most elevated positions in society. After  the usual preparatory studies, he went first to the Bloomington College,  and afterwards to the South Hanover College, in Indiana, and upon  graduating at the latter institution studied the law in his native city.  When about twenty-two years of age, having already acquired considerable  reputation in literature, by various contributions to western and southern  periodicals, he came to the Atlantic states, and with the exception of a  few months passed in Philadelphia, and a year and a half in Europe, he has  since resided in New-York, occupied in the practice of his profession and  in the pursuits of literature. Of his numerous poetical compositions, this  is the first collection, and the only volume, except _Alban, a Romance_,  intended to illustrate the influence of certain prejudices of society and  principles of law on individual character and destiny, which was published  in 1848.    His works generally are distinguished for a sensuous richness of style,  earnestness of temper, and much freedom of speculation. Throughout the  _Meditations in America_ we perceive that he is most at home in the serious  and stately rhythms and solemn fancies of such pieces as the hymn \"To a  Wind Going Seaward,\" \"The Mounds of America,\" \"The Chant of a Soul,\" &c.;  but he occasionally writes in livelier and less peculiar measures.    The late Mr. Poe in his _Marginalia_ refers to the following as one of the  finest things in American literature; it is certainly very characteristic.      THE CHANT OF A SOUL.        My youth has gone--the glory, the delight      That gave new moons unto the night,      And put in every wind a tone      And presence that was not its own.      I can no more create,      What time the Autumn blows her solemn tromp,      And goes with golden pomp      Through our unmeasurable woods:      I can no more create, sitting in youthful state      Above the mighty floods,      And peopling glen, and wave, and air,      With shapes that are immortal. Then      The earth and heaven were fair,      While only less than gods seem'd all my fellow-men.        Oh! the delight, the gladness,      The sense yet love of madness,      The glorious choral exultations,      The far-off sounding of the banded nations,      The wings of angels at melodious sweeps      Upon the mountain's hazy steeps,--      The very dead astir within their coffin'd deeps;      The dreamy veil that wrapp'd the star and sod--      A swathe of purple, gold, and amethyst;      And, luminous behind the billowy mist,      Something that look'd to my young eyes like GOD.        Too late I learn I have not lived aright,      And hence the loss of that delight      Which put a moon into the moonless night      I mingled in the human maze;      I sought their horrid shrine;      I knelt before the impure blaze;      I made their idols mine.      I lost mine early love--that love of balms      Most musical with solemn psalms      Sounding beneath the tall and graceful palms.        Who lives aright?      Answer me, all ye pyramids and piles      That look like calmest power in your still might.      Ye also do I ask, O continents and isles!      Blind though with blood ye be,      Your tongues, though torn with pain, I know are free.      Then speak, all ancient masses! speak      From patient obelisk to idle peak!      There is a heaving of the plains,      A trailing of a shroud,      A clash of bolts and chains--      A low, sad voice, that comes upon me like a cloud,              \"Oh, misery, oh, misery!\"--      Thou poor old Earth! no more, no more      Shall I draw speech from thee,      Nor dare thy crypts of legendary lore:      Let silence learn no tongue; let night fold every shore.        Yet I have something left--the will,      That Mont Blanc of the soul, is towering still.      And I can bear the pain,      The storm, the old heroic chain;      And with a smile      Pluck wisdom from my torture, and give back      A love to Fate from this my mountain-rack.      I do believe the sad alone are wise;      I do believe the wrong'd alone can know      Why lives the world, why spread the burden'd skies,      And so from torture into godship grow.      Plainer and plainer beams this truth, the more      I hear the slow, dull dripping of my gore;      And now, arising from yon deep,      'Tis plain as a white statue on a tall, dark steep.        Oh, suffering bards! oh spirits black      With storm on many a mountain-rack      Our early splendor's gone.      Like stars into a cloud withdrawn--      Like music laid asleep      In dried-up fountains--like a stricken dawn      Where sudden tempests sweep.      I hear the bolts around us falling,      And cloud to cloud forever calling:      Yet WE must nor despair nor weep.      Did WE this evil bring?      Or from our fellows did the torture spring?      Titans! forgive, forgive!      Oh, know ye not 'tis victory but to live?      Therefore I say, rejoice with harp and voice!      I know not what our fate may be:      I only know that he who hath a time      Must also have eternity:      One billow proves and gives a whole wide sea.      On this I build my trust,      And not on mountain-dust,      Or murmuring woods, or starlit clime,      Or ocean with melodious chime,      Or sunset glories in the western sky:      Enough, I _am_, and shall not choose to die.      No matter what my future fate may be:      To live is in itself a majesty!      Oh! there I may again create      Fair worlds as in my youthful state;      Or Wo may build for me a fiery tomb      Like Farinata's in the nether gloom:      Even then I will not lose the name of man      By idle moan or coward groan,      But say, \"It was so written in the mighty plan!\"    The next poem is in a vein of lofty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#3)"],[1," For me  Voisin's remains, and will, I imagine, remain the most distinguished,  the most serene, restaurant in Paris, in its retired situation at the  corner of the Rue Saint-Honore and the Rue Cambon, with its simple  decoration, its unhastening order and despatch, its Napoleonic  head-waiter, its Bacchic wine-waiter (with a head that calls for vine  leaves) and its fastidious cuisine. To Voisin's I should always make  my way when I wished not only to be delicately nourished but to be  quiet and philosophic and retired. Only one other restaurant do I know  where the cooking gives me the satisfaction of Voisin's--where  excessive richness never intrudes--and that is a discovery of my own  and not lightly to be given away. Voisin's is a name known all over  the world: one can say nothing new about Voisin's; but the little  restaurant with which I propose to tantalise you, although the resort  of some of the most thoughtful eaters in Paris, has a reputation that  has not spread. It is not cheap, it is little less dear indeed than  the Cafe Anglais or Paillard's, to name the two restaurants of renown  which are nearest to it; its cellar is poor and limited to half a  dozen wines; its two rooms are minute and hot; but the idea of  gastronomy reigns--everything is subordinated to the food and the  cooking. If you order a trout, it is the best trout that France can  breed, and it is swimming in the kitchen at the time the solitary  waiter repeats your command; no such asparagus reaches any other Paris  restaurant, no such Pre Sale and no such wild strawberries. But I have  said enough; almost I fear I have said too much. These discoveries  must be kept sacred.    And for lunch to-day? Shall it be chez Voisin, or chez Foyot, by the  Senat, or chez Laperouse (where the two Stevensons used to eat and  talk) on the Quai des Augustins? Or shall it be at my nameless  restaurant?    Voisin's to-day, I think.

Where to begin? That is a problem in the writing of every book, but  peculiarly so with Paris; because, however one may try to be  chronological, the city is such a blend of old and new that that  design is frustrated at every turn. Nearly every building of  importance stands on the site of some other which instantly jerks us  back hundreds of years, while if we deal first with the original  structure, such as the remains of the Roman Thermes at the Cluny,  built about 300, straightway the Cluny itself intrudes, and we leap  from the third century to the nineteenth; or if we trace the line of  the wall of Philip Augustus we come swiftly to so modern an  institution as the Mont-de-Piete; or if we climb to such a recent  thoroughfare as the Boulevard de Clichy, with its palpitatingly novel  cabarets and allurements, we must in order to do so ascend a mountain  which takes its name from the martyrdom of St. Denis and his  companions in the third century. It is therefore well, since Paris is  such a tangle of past and present, to disregard order altogether and  to let these pages reflect her character. Expect then, dear reader, to  be twitched about the ages without mercy.    Let us begin in earnest by leaving the mainland and adventuring upon  an island. For the heart of Paris is enisled: Notre Dame, Sainte  Chapelle, the Palais de Justice, the Hotel Dieu, the Prefecture de  Police, the Morgue--all are entirely surrounded by water. The history  of the Cite is the history of Paris, almost the history of France.    Paris, the home of the Parisii, consisted of nothing but this island  when Julius Caesar arrived there with his conquering host. The Romans  built their palace here, and here Julian the Apostate loved to  sojourn. It was in Julian's reign that the name was changed from  Lutetia (which it is still called by picturesque writers) to Parisea  Civitas, from which Paris is an easy derivative. The Cite remained the  home of government when the Merovingians under Clovis expelled the  Romans, and again under the Carlovingians. The second Royal Palace was  begun by the first of the Capets, Hugh, in the tenth century, and it  was completed by Robert the Pious in the eleventh. Louis VII. decreed  Notre Dame; but it was Saint Louis, reigning from 1226 to 1270, who  was the father of the Cite as we now know it. He it was who built  Sainte Chapelle, and it was he who surrendered part of the Palace to  the Law.    While it was the home of the Court and the Church the island naturally  had little enough room for ordinary residents, who therefore had to  live, whether aristocrats or tradespeople, on the mainland, either on  the north or south side of the river. The north side was for the most  part given to merchants, the south to scholars, for Saint Louis was  the builder not only of Sainte Chapelle but also of the Sorbonne. Very  few of the smaller buildings of that time now remain: the oldest Paris  that one now wanders in so delightedly, whether on the north bank or  the south, whether near the Sorbonne or the Hotel de Sens, dates, with  a few fortunate exceptions, from the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries.    Nowhere may the growth of Paris be better observed and better  understood than on the highest point on this Island of the City--on  the summit of Notre Dame. Standing there you quickly comprehend the  Paris of the ages: from Caesar's Lutetia, occupying the island only and  surrounded by fields and wastes, to the Paris of this year of our  Lord, spreading over the neighbouring hills, such a hive of human  activity and energy as will hardly bear thinking of--a Paris which has  thrown off the yoke not only of the kings that once were all-powerful  but of the Church too.    By the twelfth century the kings of France had begun to live in  smaller palaces more to their personal taste, such as the Hotel  Barbette, the Hotel de Sens (much of which still stands, as a glass  factory, at the corner of the Rue de l'Hotel de Ville and the Rue de  Figuier, one of the oldest of the Paris mansions), the Hotel de  Bourgogne (in the Rue Etienne Marcel: you may still see its tower of  Jean Sans Peur), the Hotel de Nevers (what remains of which is at the  corner of the Rue Colbert and Rue Richelieu), and, of course, the  Louvre. Charles VII. (1422-1461) was the first king to settle at the  Louvre permanently.    To gain the Ile de la Cite we leave the mainland of Paris at the Quai  du Louvre, and make our crossing by the Pont Neuf. Neuf no longer, for  as a matter of historical fact it is now the oldest of all the Paris  bridges: that is, in its foundations, for the visible part of it has  been renovated quite recently. The first stone of it was laid by Henri  III. in 1578: it was not ready for many years, but in 1603 Henri IV.  (of Navarre) ventured across a plank of it on his way to the Louvre,  after several previous adventurers had broken their necks in the  attempt. \"So much the less kings they,\" was his comment. He lived to  see the bridge finished.    Behind the statue of this monarch, whom the French still adore, is the  garden that finishes off the west end of the Ile very prettily,  sending its branches up above the parapet. Here we may stop; for we  are now on the Island itself, midway between the two halves of the  bridge, and the statue has such a curious history, so typical of the  French character, that I should like to tell it. The original bronze  figure, erected by Louis XIII. in 1614, was taken down in 1792, a  time of stress, and melted into a commodity that was then of vastly  greater importance than the effigies of kings--namely cannon. (As we  shall see in the course of this book, Paris left the hands of the  Revolutionaries a totally different city from the Paris of 1791.) Then  came peace again, and then came Napoleon, and in the collection at  the Archives is to be seen a letter written by the Emperor from  Schoenbrunn, on August 15th, 1809, stating that he wishes an obelisk  to be erected on the site of the Henri IV. statue--an obelisk of  Cherbourg granite, 180 pieds d'elevation, with the inscription  \"l'Empereur Napoleon au Peuple Francais\". That, however, was not done.    Time passed on, Napoleon fell, and Louis XVIII. returned from his  English home to the throne of France, and was not long in perpetrating  one of those symmetrical ironical jests which were then in vogue.  Taking from the Vendome column the bronze statue of Napoleon (who was  safely under the thumb of Sir Hudson Lowe at St. Helena, well out of  mischief), and to this adding a second bronze statue of the same  usurper intended for some other site, the monarch directed that they  should be melted into liquid from which a new statue of Henri IV.--the  very one at which we are at this moment gazing--should be cast. It was  done, and though to the Roentgen-rayed vision of the cynic it may  appear to be nothing more or less than a double Napoleon, it is to  the world at large Henri IV., the hero of Ivry.    I have seen comparisons between the Seine and the Thames; but they are  pointless. You cannot compare them: one is a London river, and the  other is a Paris river. The Seine is a river of light; the Thames is a  river of twilight. The Seine is gay; the Thames is sombre. When dusk  falls in Paris the Seine is just a river in the evening; when dusk  falls in London the Thames becomes a wonderful mystery, an enchanted  stream in a land of old romance. The Thames is, I think, vastly more  beautiful; but on the other hand, the Thames has no merry"]]]
