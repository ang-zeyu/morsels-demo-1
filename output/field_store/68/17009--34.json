Now I am not going to attempt a history of science. Such a work in ten  lectures would be absurd. I intend to pick out a few salient names here  and there, and to study these in some detail, rather than by attempting  to deal with too many to lose individuality and distinctness.    We know so little of the great names of antiquity, that they are for  this purpose scarcely suitable. In some departments the science of the  Greeks was remarkable, though it is completely overshadowed by their  philosophy; yet it was largely based on what has proved to be a wrong  method of procedure, viz the introspective and conjectural, rather than  the inductive and experimental methods. They investigated Nature by  studying their own minds, by considering the meanings of words, rather  than by studying things and recording phenomena. This wrong (though by  no means, on the face of it, absurd) method was not pursued exclusively,  else would their science have been valueless, but the influence it had  was such as materially to detract from the value of their speculations  and discoveries. For when truth and falsehood are inextricably woven  into a statement, the truth is as hopelessly hidden as if it had never  been stated, for we have no criterion to distinguish the false from the  true.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Archimedes.]    Besides this, however, many of their discoveries were ultimately lost to  the world, some, as at Alexandria, by fire--the bigoted work of a  Mohammedan conqueror--some by irruption of barbarians; and all were  buried so long and so completely by the night of the dark ages, that  they had to be rediscovered almost as absolutely and completely as  though they had never been. Some of the names of antiquity we shall have  occasion to refer to; so I have arranged some of them in chronological  order on page 4, and as a representative one I may specially emphasize  Archimedes, one of the greatest men of science there has ever been, and  the father of physics.    The only effective link between the old and the new science is afforded  by the Arabs. The dark ages come as an utter gap in the scientific  history of Europe, and for more than a thousand years there was not a  scientific man of note except in Arabia; and with the Arabs knowledge  was so mixed up with magic and enchantment that one cannot contemplate  it with any degree of satisfaction, and little real progress was made.  In some of the _Waverley Novels_ you can realize the state of matters in  these times; and you know how the only approach to science is through  some Arab sorcerer or astrologer, maintained usually by a monarch, and  consulted upon all great occasions, as the oracles were of old.    In the thirteenth century, however, a really great scientific man  appeared, who may be said to herald the dawn of modern science in  Europe. This man was Roger Bacon. He cannot be said to do more than  herald it, however, for we must wait two hundred years for the next name  of great magnitude; moreover he was isolated, and so far in advance of  his time that he left no followers. His own work suffered from the  prevailing ignorance, for he was persecuted and imprisoned, not for the  commonplace and natural reason that he frightened the Church, but merely  because he was eccentric in his habits and knew too much.    The man I spoke of as coming two hundred years later is Leonardo da  Vinci. True he is best known as an artist, but if you read his works you  will come to the conclusion that he was the most scientific artist who  ever lived. He teaches the laws of perspective (then new), of light and  shade, of colour, of the equilibrium of bodies, and of a multitude of  other matters where science touches on art--not always quite correctly  according to modern ideas, but in beautiful and precise language. For  clear and conscious power, for wide-embracing knowledge and skill,  Leonardo is one of the most remarkable men that ever lived.    About this time the tremendous invention of printing was achieved, and  Columbus unwittingly discovered the New World. The middle of the next  century must be taken as the real dawn of modern science; for the year  1543 marks the publication of the life-work of Copernicus.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Leonardo da Vinci.]    Nicolas Copernik was his proper name. Copernicus is merely the Latinized  form of it, according to the then prevailing fashion. He was born at  Thorn, in Polish Prussia, in 1473. His father is believed to have been a  German. He graduated at Cracow as doctor in arts and medicine, and was  destined for the ecclesiastical profession. The details of his life are  few; it seems to have been quiet and uneventful, and we know very little  about it. He was instructed in astronomy at Cracow, and learnt  mathematics at Bologna. Thence he went to Rome, where he was made  Professor of Mathematics; and soon afterwards he went into orders. On  his return home, he took charge of the principal church in his native  place, and became a canon. At Frauenburg, near the mouth of the Vistula,  he lived the remainder of his life. We find him reporting on coinage for  the Government, but otherwise he does not appear as having entered into  the life of the times.    He was a quiet, scholarly monk of studious habits, and with a reputation  which drew to him several earnest students, who received _viva voce_  instruction from him; so, in study and meditation, his life passed.    He compiled tables of the planetary motions which were far more correct  than any which had hitherto appeared, and which remained serviceable for  long afterwards. The Ptolemaic system of the heavens, which had been the  orthodox system all through the Christian era, he endeavoured to improve  and simplify by the hypothesis that the sun was the centre of the system  instead of the earth; and the first consequences of this change he  worked out for many years, producing in the end a great book: his one  life-work. This famous work, \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium,\"  embodied all his painstaking calculations, applied his new system to  each of the bodies in the solar system in succession, and treated  besides of much other recondite matter. Towards the close of his life it  was put into type. He can scarcely be said to have lived to see it  appear, for he was stricken with paralysis before its completion; but a  printed copy was brought to his bedside and put into his hands, so that  he might just feel it before he died.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Copernicus.]    That Copernicus was a giant in intellect or power--such as had lived in  the past, and were destined to live in the near future--I see no reason  whatever to believe. He was just a quiet, earnest, patient, and  God-fearing man, a deep student, an unbiassed thinker, although with no  specially brilliant or striking gifts; yet to him it was given to effect  such a revolution in the whole course of man's thoughts as is difficult  to parallel.    You know what the outcome of his work was. It proved--he did not merely  speculate, he proved--that the earth is a planet like the others, and  that it revolves round the sun.    Yes, it can be summed up in a sentence, but what a revelation it  contains. If you have never made an effort to grasp the full  significance of this discovery you will not appreciate it. The doctrine  is very familiar to us now, we have heard it, I suppose, since we were  four years old, but can you realize it? I know it was a long time before  I could. Think of the solid earth, with trees and houses, cities and  countries, mountains and seas--think of the vast tracts of land in Asia,  Africa, and America--and then picture the whole mass spinning like a  top, and rushing along its annual course round the sun at the rate of  nineteen miles every second.    Were we not accustomed to it, the idea would be staggering. No wonder it  was received with incredulity. But the difficulties of the conception  are not only physical, they are still more felt from the speculative and  theological points of view. With this last, indeed, the reconcilement  cannot be considered complete even yet. Theologians do not, indeed, now  _deny_ the fact of the earth's subordination in the scheme of the  universe, but many of them ignore it and pass it by. So soon as the  Church awoke to a perception of the tremendous and revolutionary import  of the new doctrines, it was bound to resist them or be false to its  traditions. For the whole tenor of men's thought must have been changed  had they accepted it. If the earth were not the central and  all-important body in the universe, if the sun and planets and stars  were not attendant and subsidiary lights, but were other worlds larger  and perhaps superior to ours, where was man's place in the universe?  and where were the doctrines they had maintained as irrefragable? I by  no means assert that the new doctrines were really utterly  irreconcilable with the more essential parts of the old dogmas, if only  theologians had had patience and genius enough to consider the matter  calmly. I suppose that in that case they might have reached the amount  of reconciliation at present attained, and not only have left scientific  truth in peace to spread as it could, but might perhaps themselves have  joined the band of earnest students and workers, as so many of the  higher Catholic clergy do at the present day.    But this was too much to expect. Such a revelation was not to be  accepted in a day or in a century--the easiest plan was to treat it as a  heresy, and try to crush it out.    Not in Copernik's life, however, did they perceive the dangerous  tendency of the doctrine--partly because it was buried in a ponderous  and learned treatise not likely to be easily understood; partly,  perhaps, because its propounder was himself an ecclesiastic; mainly  because he was a patient"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#3)"],[1,"as the lungs drew in a first long breath,  and, with that, an astonished and very much alive rodent scrambled to  its feet, blinking wondering eyes in the dazzling light.    \"See? See?\" shouted Tom, grasping Old Crompton by the arm in a viselike  grip. \"It is the secret of life and death! Aristocrats, plutocrats and  beggars will beat a path to my door. But, never fear, I shall choose my  subjects well. The name of Thomas Forsythe will yet be emblazoned in the  Hall of Fame. I shall be master of the world!\"    Old Crompton began to fear the glitter in the eyes of the gaunt young  man who seemed suddenly to have become demented. And his envy and hatred  of his talented host blazed anew as Forsythe gloried in the success of  his efforts. Then he was struck with an idea and he affected his most  ingratiating manner.    \"It is a marvelous thing, Tom,\" he said, \"and is entirely beyond my poor  comprehension. But I can see that it is all you say and more. Tell  me--can you restore the youth of an aged person by these means?\"    \"Positively!\" Tom did not catch the eager note in the old man's voice.  Rather he took the question as an inquiry into the further marvels of  his process. \"Here,\" he continued, enthusiastically, \"I'll prove that to  you also. My dog Spot is around the place somewhere. And he is a  decrepit old hound, blind, lame and toothless. You've probably seen him  with me.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He rushed to the stairs and whistled. There was an answering yelp from  above and the pad of uncertain paws on the bare wooden steps. A dejected  old beagle blundered into the room, dragging a crippled hind leg as he  fawned upon his master, who stretched forth a hand to pat the unsteady  head.    \"Guess Spot is old enough for the test,\" laughed Tom, \"and I have been  meaning to restore him to his youthful vigor, anyway. No time like the  present.\"    He led his trembling pet to the table of the remarkable tubes and lifted  him to its surface. The poor old beast lay trustingly where he was  placed, quiet, save for his husky asthmatic breathing.    \"Hold him, Crompton,\" directed Tom as he pulled the starting lever of  his apparatus.    And Old Crompton watched in fascinated anticipation as the ethereal  luminosity bathed the dog's body in response to the action of the four  rays. Somewhat vaguely it came to him that the baggy flesh of his own  wrinkled hands took on a new firmness and color where they reposed on  the animal's back. Young Forsythe grinned triumphantly as Spot's  breathing became more regular and the rasp gradually left it. Then the  dog whined in pleasure and wagged his tail with increasing vigor.  Suddenly he raised his head, perked his ears in astonishment and looked  his master straight in the face with eyes that saw once more. The low  throat cry rose to a full and joyous bark. He sprang to his feet from  under the restraining hands and jumped to the floor in a lithe-muscled  leap that carried him half way across the room. He capered about with  the abandon of a puppy, making extremely active use of four sound limbs.    \"Why--why, Forsythe,\" stammered the hermit, \"it's absolutely incredible.  Tell me--tell me--what is this remarkable force?\"           *       *       *       *       *    His host laughed gleefully. \"You probably wouldn't understand it anyway,  but I'll tell you. It is as simple as the nose on your face. The spark  of life, the vital force, is merely an extremely complicated electrical  manifestation which I have been able to duplicate artificially. This  spark or force is all that distinguishes living from inanimate matter,  and in living beings the force gradually decreases in power as the years  pass, causing loss of health and strength. The chemical composition of  bones and tissue alters, joints become stiff, muscles atrophied, and  bones brittle. By recharging, as it were, with the vital force, the  gland action is intensified, youth and strength is renewed. By repeating  the process every ten or fifteen years the same degree of vigor can be  maintained indefinitely. Mankind will become immortal. That is why I say  I am to be master of the world.\"    For the moment Old Crompton forgot his jealous hatred in the enthusiasm  with which he was imbued. \"Tom--Tom,\" he pleaded in his excitement, \"use  me as a subject. Renew my youth. My life has been a sad one and a lonely  one, but I would that I might live it over. I should make of it a far  different one--something worth while. See, I am ready.\"    He sat on the edge of the gleaming table and made as if to lie down on  its gleaming surface. But his young host only stared at him in open  amusement.    \"What? You?\" he sneered, unfeelingly. \"Why, you old fossil! I told you I  would choose my subjects carefully. They are to be people of standing  and wealth, who can contribute to the fame and fortune of one Thomas  Forsythe.\"    \"But Tom, I have money,\" Old Crompton begged. But when he saw the hard  mirth in the younger man's eyes, his old animosity flamed anew and he  sprang from his position and shook a skinny forefinger in Tom's face.    \"Don't do that to me, you old fool!\" shouted Tom, \"and get out of here.  Think I'd waste current on an old cadger like you? I guess not! Now get  out. Get out, I say!\"    Then the old anchorite saw red. Something seemed to snap in his soured  old brain. He found himself kicking and biting and punching at his host,  who backed away from the furious onslaught in surprise. Then Tom tripped  over a wire and fell to the floor with a force that rattled the windows,  his ferocious little adversary on top. The younger man lay still where  he had fallen, a trickle of blood showing at his temple.    \"My God! I've killed him!\" gasped the old man.    With trembling fingers he opened Tom's shirt and listened for his  heartbeats. Panic-stricken, he rubbed the young man's wrists, slapped  his cheeks, and ran for water to dash in his face. But all efforts to  revive him proved futile, and then, in awful fear, Old Crompton dashed  into the night, the dog Spot snapping at his heels as he ran.           *       *       *       *       *    Hours later the stooped figure of a shabby old man might have been seen  stealthily re-entering the lonely workshop where the lights still burned  brightly. Tom Forsythe lay rigid in the position in which Old Crompton  had left him, and the dog growled menacingly.    Averting his gaze and circling wide of the body, Old Crompton made for  the table of the marvelous rays. In minute detail he recalled every move  made by Tom in starting and adjusting the apparatus to produce the  incredible results he had witnessed. Not a moment was to be wasted now.  Already he had hesitated too long, for soon would come the dawn and  possible discovery of his crime. But the invention of his victim would  save him from the long arm of the law, for, with youth restored, Old  Crompton would cease to exist and a new life would open its doors to the  starved soul of the hermit. Hermit, indeed! He would begin life anew, an  active man with youthful vigor and ambition. Under an assumed name he  would travel abroad, would enjoy life, and would later become a  successful man of affairs. He had enough money, he told himself. And the  police would never find Old Crompton, the murderer of Tom Forsythe! He  deposited his small traveling bag on the floor and fingered the controls  of Tom's apparatus.    He threw the starting switch confidently and grinned in satisfaction as  the answering whine of the motor-generator came to his ears. One by one  he carefully made the adjustments in exactly the manner followed by the  now silenced discoverer of the process. Everything operated precisely as  it had during the preceding experiments. Odd that he should have  anticipated some such necessity! But something had told him to observe  Tom's movements carefully, and now he rejoiced in the fact that his  intuition had led him aright. Painfully he climbed to the table top and  stretched his aching body in the warm light of the four huge tubes. His  exertions during the struggle with Tom were beginning to tell on him.  But the soreness and stiffness of feeble muscles and stubborn joints  would soon be but a memory. His pulses quickened at the thought and he  breathed deep in a sudden feeling of unaccustomed well-being.           *       *       *       *       *    The dog growled continuously from his position at the head of his  master, but did not move to interfere with the intruder. And Old  Crompton, in the excitement of the momentous experience, paid him not  the slightest attention.    His body tingled from head to foot with a not unpleasant sensation that  conveyed the assurance of radical changes taking place under the  influence of the vital rays. The tingling sensation increased in  intensity until it seemed that every corpuscle in his veins danced to  the tune of the vibration from those glowing tubes that bathed him in an  ever-spreading radiance. Aches and pains vanished from his body, but he  soon experienced a sharp stab of new pain in his lower jaw. With an  experimental forefinger he rubbed the gum. He laughed aloud as the  realization came to him that in those gums where there had been no teeth  for more than twenty years there was now growing a complete new set. And  the rapidity of the process amazed him beyond measure. The aching area  spread quickly and was becoming really uncomfortable. But then--and he  consoled himself with the thought--nothing is brought into being without  a certain amount of pain. Besides, he was confident that his discomfort  would soon be over.    He examined his hand, and found that the joints of two fingers long  crippled with rheumatism now moved freely and painlessly. The misty  brilliance surrounding his body was paling and he saw that the flesh was  taking on a faint green fluorescence instead. The rays had completed  their work and"]]]
