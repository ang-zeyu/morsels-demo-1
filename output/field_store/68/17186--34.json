The primary object of geographical exploration is the opening to general  intercourse such portions of the earth as may become serviceable to the  human race. The explorer is the precursor of the colonist; and the  colonist is the human instrument by which the great work must be  constructed--that greatest and most difficult of all undertakings--the  civilization of the world.    The progress of civilization depends upon geographical position. The  surface of the earth presents certain facilities and obstacles to  general access; those points that are easily attainable must always  enjoy a superior civilization to those that are remote from association  with the world.    We may thus assume that the advance of civilization is dependent upon  facility of transport. Countries naturally excluded from communication  may, through the ingenuity of man, be rendered accessible; the natural  productions of those lands may be transported to the seacoast in  exchange for foreign commodities; and commerce, thus instituted, becomes  the pioneer of civilization.    England, the great chief of the commercial world, possesses a power that  enforces a grave responsibility. She has the force to civilize. She is  the natural colonizer of the world. In the short space of three  centuries, America, sprung from her loins, has become a giant offspring,  a new era in the history of the human race, a new birth whose future  must be overwhelming. Of later date, and still more rapid in  development, Australia rises, a triumphant proof of England's power to  rescue wild lands from barrenness; to wrest from utter savagedom those  mighty tracts of the earth's surface wasted from the creation of the  world,--a darkness to be enlightened by English colonization. Before the  advancing steps of civilization the savage inhabitants of dreary wastes  retreated: regions hitherto lain hidden, and counting as nothing in the  world's great total, have risen to take the lead in the world's great  future.    Thus England's seed cast upon the earth's surface germinates upon soils  destined to reproduce her race. The energy and industry of the mother  country become the natural instincts of her descendants in localities  adapted for their development; and wherever Nature has endowed a land  with agricultural capabilities, and favourable geographical position,  slowly but surely that land will become a centre of civilization.    True Christianity cannot exist apart from civilization; thus, the spread  of Christianity must depend upon the extension of civilization; and that  extension depends upon commerce.    The philanthropist and the missionary will expend their noble energies  in vain in struggling against the obtuseness of savage hordes, until the  first steps towards their gradual enlightenment shall have been made by  commerce. The savage must learn to WANT; he must learn to be ambitious;  and to covet more than the mere animal necessities of food and drink.  This can alone be taught by a communication with civilized beings: the  sight of men well clothed will induce the naked savage to covet  clothing, and will create a WANT; the supply of this demand will be the  first step towards commerce. To obtain the supply, the savage must  produce some article in return as a medium of barter, some natural  production of his country adapted to the trader's wants. His wants will  increase as his ideas expand by communication with Europeans: thus, his  productions must increase in due proportion, and he must become  industrious; industry being the first grand stride towards civilization.    The natural energy of all countries is influenced by climate; and  civilization being dependent upon industry, or energy, must accordingly  vary in its degrees according to geographical position. The natives of  tropical countries do not progress: enervated by intense heat, they  incline rather to repose and amusement than to labour. Free from the  rigour of winters, and the excitement of changes in the seasons, the  native character assumes the monotony of their country's temperature.  They have no natural difficulties to contend with,--no struggle with  adverse storms and icy winds and frost-bound soil; but an everlasting  summer, and fertile ground producing with little tillage, excite no  enterprise; and the human mind, unexercised by difficulties, sinks into  languor and decay. There are a lack of industry, a want of intensity of  character, a love of ease and luxury, which leads to a devotion to"]]]
