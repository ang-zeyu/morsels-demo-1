DESCRIPTION    Color and Pattern      Color predominantly brown, ranging through pale reddish-brown or dark  reddish-brown, brownish-green, to almost black; 10 to 17 irregular dark  brown bands on paler brown ground color; young paler (some nearly salmon  pink), retaining a vivid pattern throughout first year; pattern of most  individuals nearly obliterated by third year; brilliance and dullness of  predominant color correlated with molting cycle (skin especially bright  and shiny immediately following shedding); tip of tail yellowish in  juveniles; posterior part of venter and tail uniformly black in some  adult individuals, especially females; secondary sexual differences in  dorsal coloration, such as found in copperhead by Fitch (1960:102), not  noted.    The eastern subspecies, _A. p. piscivorus_, has the more brilliant  pattern in which the centers of the dark cross-bands are invaded by the  ground color. The cross-bands are slightly constricted in the mid-line  and may or may not be bilaterally symmetrical. One-half of the  cross-band may be displaced anteriorly or posteriorly to a slight degree  or may even be completely absent. From one to several dark spots may be  present within the cross-bands.    The western subspecies, _A. p. leucostoma_, has a comparatively dull  pattern in which the ground color does not invade the center of the  cross-bands. In many instances the bands are outlined by white scales,  as in the Mexican moccasin (this character is not so prominent in _A. p.  piscivorus_ because of the paler ground color). A large, dark blotch  usually occurs at the base of the cross-band and may completely cross  the ventral scales. The characteristic variations found in _piscivorus_  are also present in _leucostoma_.    The number of bands is often difficult to count because of the dark  color of some specimens. Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) reported averages  of 12.5 (11 to 16) and 12.2 (10 to 16) in males and females,  respectively, of _leucostoma_ and ranges of 10 to 17 for males and 10 to  16 for females with averages of 13 in both sexes of _piscivorus_. On 20  specimens of _leucostoma_ from Texas the average number of bands was  12.7 (11 to 15). If the number of bands differed on the two sides of an  animal, the total number of the two sides was divided by two.      Scutellation    The scutellation of the cottonmouth closely resembles that of the other  species of _Agkistrodon_. For example, the nine cephalic shields are  characteristic of most species of _Agkistrodon_, as well as most other  primitive crotalids and viperids, and most colubrids. Most individuals  have an additional pair of large scales behind the parietals.    The numbers of postoculars, supralabials, and infralabials are variable.  On either side the postoculars (three in most specimens) are reduced to  two in some specimens. The supralabials (eight in most specimens)  frequently vary (usually on one side only) from seven to nine. The  number of infralabials is somewhat more variable than the number of  supralabials, the usual number being 11, but 10 is also common; 8, 9,  and 12 are more rare (Table 1). In 102 snakes in which these characters  were examined, four different combinations of supralabials and seven  combinations of infralabials were found. Both characters together  yielded 16 combinations, considering only the actual number of scales  and not taking into account the side of the head on which they occurred  (Table 2). The combinations found in a brood of seven young from  Houston, Texas, are shown in Table 3 to illustrate the variability of  this character. Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) found a variation of 6 to 11  (8) and 7 to 9 (8) supralabials and 8 to 13 (11) and 8 to 12 (10.4)  infralabials in samples of 301 _leucostoma_ and 119 _piscivorus_,  respectively (numbers in parentheses represent average). Also of  interest is the variability of the scales themselves. In one instance a  scale was found that had not completely divided. In another specimen the  last supralabial and last infralabial were one scale that completely  lined the angle of the jaw. Instances of one scale almost crowding out  another were common. In still other instances one or two supralabials  were divided horizontally into two scales. Individual variation rather  than geographical variation occurs in these characters.

Also they  are slightly larger than the others. Two apical pits are present on each  dorsal scale. The shape of the scales and number of scale rows vary  depending upon the position on the body. Scales on the neck are  considerably smaller than those elsewhere on the body and are arranged  in two or three more rows than those at mid-body. The skin in the region  of the throat, neck, and fore-body is especially elastic and allows the  swallowing of large prey. Posteriorly from the mid-body the scales  decrease in size and become more angular, those on the tail tending to  be rhomboidal and wider than long. In the region of the anus the number  of scale rows diminishes rapidly, leaving only 12 to 14 rows at the base  of the tail and only three rows immediately ahead of the tail tip. The  tail ends in a spine composed of two scales: one scale covers the  bottom, lower parts of the sides, and tip of the spine; and a shorter  dorsal scale covers the top and upper parts of the sides of the basal  two-thirds of the spine. The spine of embryos and young cottonmouths is  blunt, but is pointed in most adults.

The necessity of knowing, from an artistic point of view, the structure  of the human body makes clear the importance we attach, from the same  point of view, to the study of the anatomy of animals--that is, the  study of comparative anatomy. The name employed to designate this branch  of anatomy shows that the object of this science is the study of the  relative position and form which each region presents in all organized  beings, taking for comparison the corresponding regions in man. The head  in animals compared with the human head; the trunk and limbs compared to  the trunk and limbs of the human being--this is the analysis we  undertake, and the plan of the subject we are about to commence.    Our intention being, as we have just said, the comparison of the  structure of animals with that of man, should we describe the anatomy of  the human being in the pages which follow? We do not think so. Plastic  human anatomy having been previously studied in special works,[2] we  take it for granted that these have been studied before undertaking the  subject of comparative anatomy. We will therefore not occupy time with  the elementary facts relative to the skeleton and the superficial layer  of muscles. We will not dilate on the division of the bones into long,  short, large, single, paired, etc. All these preliminary elements we  shall suppose to have been already studied.

This being granted, it is, nevertheless, necessary to take a rapid  bird's-eye view of organized beings, and to recall the terms used in  their classification.    Animals are primarily classed in great divisions, based on the general  characters which differentiate them most. These divisions, or  _branches_, allow of their being so grouped that in each of them we find  united the individuals whose general structure is uniform; and under the  name of vertebrates are included man and the animals with which our  studies will be occupied. The vertebrates, as the name indicates, are  recognised by the presence of an interior skeleton formed by a central  axis, the vertebral column, round which the other parts of the skeleton  are arranged.    The vertebrate branch is divided into classes: fishes, amphibians or  batrachians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.    The mammals--from the Latin _mamma_, a breast--are characterized by the  presence of breasts designed for the alimentation of their young. Their  bodies are covered with hair, hence the name _piliferes_ proposed by  Blainville; and, notwithstanding that in some individuals the hairs are  few, the character is sufficient to distinguish them from all other  vertebrates.    We find united in this class animals which, at first, seem out of place,  such as the whale and the bat; and, from their external appearance  alone, the former would appear to belong to the fishes, and the latter  to birds. Yet, on studying their structure, we find that, not only do  these animals merit a place in the class which they occupy, because they  possess the distinctive characters of mammals; but, still further, their  internal structure is analogous to that of man and of the other  individuals of this class.    Notwithstanding this similarity of structure, the whale is not without  some points of difference from its neighbours the horse and the dog;  therefore, in order to place each of these animals in a position  suitable to it, mammals are divided into secondary groups called  _orders_. The first of these orders includes, under the name _primates_,  man and apes. The latter contain animals which approach birds in certain  characters of their organism, forming a link between the latter"]]]
