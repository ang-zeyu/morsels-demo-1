They contribute their mites to the general fund, some putting in a  pound, others half a sovereign, and the Oracle takes it into the ring to  invest, half on the favourite and half on Royal Scot. He finds that the  favourite is at two to one, and Royal Scot at threes, eight to one  being offered against anything else. As he ploughs through the ring, a  Whisperer (one of those broken-down followers of the turf who get  their living in various mysterious ways, but partly by giving \"tips\" to  backers) pulls his sleeve.    \"What are you backing?\" he says.    \"Favourite and Royal Scot,\" says the Oracle.    \"Put a pound on Bendemeer,\" says the tipster. \"It's a certainty. Meet  me here if it comes off, and I'll tell you something for the next race.  Don't miss it now. Get on quick!\"    The Oracle is humble enough before the hanger-on of the turf. A  bookmaker roars \"10 to 1 Bendemeer;\" he suddenly fishes out a sovereign  of his own--and he hasn't money to spare, for all his knowingness--and  puts it on Bendemeer. His friends' money he puts on the favourite and  Royal Scot as arranged. Then they all go round to watch the race.    The horses are at the post; a distant cluster of crowded animals with  little dots of colour on their backs. Green, blue, yellow, purple,  French grey, and old gold, they change about in a bewildering manner,  and though the Oracle has a cheap pair of glasses, he can't make out  where Bendemeer has got to. Royal Scot and the favourite he has lost  interest in, and secretly hopes that they will be left at the post  or break their necks; but he does not confide his sentiment to his  companions.    They're off! The long line of colours across the track becomes a  shapeless clump and then draws out into a long string. \"What's that in  front?\" yells someone at the rails. \"Oh, that thing of Hart's,\" says  someone else. But the Oracle hears them not; he is looking in the mass  of colour for a purple cap and grey jacket, with black arm bands. He  cannot see it anywhere, and the confused and confusing mass swings round  the turn into the straight.    Then there is a babel of voices, and suddenly a shout of \"Bendemeer!  Bendemeer!\" and the Oracle, without knowing which is Bendemeer, takes  up the cry feverishly. \"Bendemeer! Bendemeer!\" he yells, waggling his  glasses about, trying to see where the animal is.    \"Where's Royal Scot, Charley? Where's Royal Scot?\" screams one of his  friends, in agony. \"'Ow's he doin'?\"    \"No 'ope!\" says the Oracle, with fiendish glee. \"Bendemeer! Bendemeer!\"    The horses are at the Leger stand now, whips are out, and three horses  seem to be nearly abreast; in fact, to the Oracle there seem to be a  dozen nearly abreast. Then a big chestnut sticks his head in front  of the others, and a small man at the Oracle's side emits a deafening  series of yells right by the Oracle's ear:    \"Go on, Jimmy! Rub it into him! Belt him! It's a cake-walk! A cake-walk!\"  The big chestnut, in a dogged sort of way, seems to stick his body clear  of his opponents, and passes the post a winner by a length. The Oracle  doesn't know what has won, but fumbles with his book. The number on the  saddle-cloth catches his eye--No. 7; he looks hurriedly down the page.  No. 7--Royal Scot. Second is No. 24--Bendemeer. Favourite nowhere.    Hardly has he realised it, before his friends are cheering and clapping  him on the back. \"By George, Charley, it takes you to pick 'em.\" \"Come  and 'ave a wet!\" \"You 'ad a quid in, didn't you, Charley?\" The Oracle  feels very sick at having missed the winner, but he dies game. \"Yes,  rather; I had a quid on,\" he says. \"And\" (here he nerves himself to  smile) \"I had a saver on the second, too.\"    His comrades gasp with astonishment. \"D'you hear that, eh? Charley  backed first and second. That's pickin' 'em if you like.\" They have a  wet, and pour fulsome adulation on the Oracle when he collects their  money.    After the Oracle has collected the winnings for his friends he meets the  Whisperer again.    \"It didn't win?\" he says to the Whisperer in inquiring tones.    \"Didn't win,\" says the Whisperer, who has determined to brazen the  matter out. \"How could he win? Did you see the way he was ridden? That  horse was stiffened just after I seen you, and he never tried a yard.  Did you see the way he was pulled and hauled about at the turn? It'd  make a man sick. What was the stipendiary stewards doing, I wonder?\"    This fills the Oracle with a new idea. All that he remembers of the race  at the turn was a jumble of colours, a kaleidoscope of horses and of  riders hanging on to the horses' necks. But it wouldn't do to admit that  he didn't see everything, and didn't know everything; so he plunges in  boldly.    \"O' course I saw it,\" he says. \"And a blind man could see it. They ought  to rub him out.\"    \"Course they ought,\" says the Whisperer. \"But, look here, put two quid  on Tell-tale; you'll get it all back!\"    The Oracle does put on \"two quid\", and doesn't get it all back. Neither  does he see any more of this race than he did of the last one--in fact,  he cheers wildly when the wrong horse is coming in. But when the public  begin to hoot he hoots as loudly as anybody--louder if anything; and all  the way home in the tram he lays down the law about stiff running, and  wants to know what the stipendiaries are doing.    If you go into any barber's shop, you can hear him at it, and he  flourishes in suburban railway carriages; but he has a tremendous local  reputation, having picked first and second in the handicap, and it would  be a bold man who would venture to question the Oracle's knowledge of  racing and of all matters relating to it.          THE CAST-IRON CANVASSER      The firm of Sloper and Dodge, publishers and printers, was in great  distress. These two enterprising individuals had worked up an enormous  business in time-payment books, which they sold all over Australia  by means of canvassers. They had put all the money they had into the  business; and now, just when everything was in thorough working order,  the public had revolted against them.    Their canvassers were molested by the country folk in divers strange  bush ways. One was made drunk, and then a two-horse harrow was run over  him; another was decoyed into the ranges on pretence of being shown a  gold-mine, and his guide galloped away and left him to freeze all night  in the bush. In mining localities the inhabitants were called together  by beating a camp-oven lid with a pick, and the canvasser was given ten  minutes in which to get out of the town alive. If he disregarded the  hint he would, as likely as not, fall accidentally down a disused shaft.    The people of one district applied to their M.P. to have canvassers  brought under the \"Noxious Animals Act\", and demanded that a reward  should be offered for their scalps. Reports appeared in the country  press about strange, gigantic birds that appeared at remote selections  and frightened the inhabitants to death--these were Sloper and Dodge's  sober and reliable agents, wearing neat, close-fitting suits of tar and  feathers.    In fact, it was altogether too hot for the canvassers, and they came  in from North and West and South, crippled and disheartened, to tender  their resignations. To make matters worse, Sloper and Dodge had just  got out a large Atlas of Australasia, and if they couldn't sell it, ruin  stared them in the face; and how could they sell it without canvassers?    The members of the firm sat in their private office. Sloper was a long,  sanctimonious individual, very religious and very bald. Dodge was a  little, fat American, with bristly, black hair and beard, and quick,  beady eyes. He was eternally smoking a reeking black pipe, and puffing  the smoke through his nose in great whiffs, like a locomotive on a  steep grade. Anybody walking into one of those whiffs was liable to get  paralysis.    Just as things were at their very blackest, something had turned up that  promised to relieve all their difficulties. An inventor had offered to  supply them with a patent cast-iron canvasser--a figure which (he said)  when wound up would walk, talk, collect orders, and stand any amount  of ill-usage and wear and tear. If this could indeed be done, they  were saved. They had made an appointment with the genius; but he was  half-an-hour late, and the partners were steeped in gloom.    They had begun to despair of his appearing at all, when a cab rattled up  to the door. Sloper and Dodge rushed unanimously to the window. A  young man, very badly dressed, stepped out of the cab, holding over  his shoulder what looked like the upper half of a man's body. In his  disengaged hand he held a pair of human legs with boots and trousers on.  Thus burdened he turned to ask his fare, but the cabman gave a yell of  terror, whipped up his horse, and disappeared at a hand-gallop; and a  woman who happened to be going by, ran down the street, howling that  Jack the Ripper had come to town. The man bolted in at the door, and  toiled up the dark stairs tramping heavily, the legs and feet, which he  dragged after him, making an unearthly clatter. He came in and put his  burden down on the sofa.    \"There you are, gents,\" he said; \"there's your canvasser.\"    Sloper and Dodge recoiled in horror. The upper part of the man had a  waxy face, dull, fishy eyes, and dark hair; he lounged on the sofa like  a corpse at ease, while his legs and feet stood by, leaning stiffly  against the wall. The partners gazed at him for a while in silence.    \"Fix him together, for God's sake,\" said Dodge. \"He looks awful.\"    The Genius grinned, and fixed the legs on.    \"Now he looks better,\" said Dodge, poking about the figure--\"looks  as much like life "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#3)"],[1,"of Water,              417    22.

Since the first dominion of men was asserted over the ocean,  three thrones, of mark beyond all others, have been set upon its sands:  the thrones of Tyre, Venice, and England. Of the First of these great  powers only the memory remains; of the Second, the ruin; the Third,  which inherits their greatness, if it forget their example, may be led  through prouder eminence to less pitied destruction.    The exaltation, the sin, and the punishment of Tyre have been recorded  for us, in perhaps the most touching words ever uttered by the Prophets  of Israel against the cities of the stranger. But we read them as a  lovely song; and close our ears to the sternness of their warning: for  the very depth of the Fall of Tyre has blinded us to its reality, and we  forget, as we watch the bleaching of the rocks between the sunshine and  the sea, that they were once \"as in Eden, the garden of God.\"    Her successor, like her in perfection of beauty, though less in  endurance of dominion, is still left for our beholding in the final  period of her decline: a ghost upon the sands of the sea, so weak--so  quiet,--so bereft of all but her loveliness, that we might well doubt,  as we watched her faint reflection in the mirage of the lagoon, which  was the City, and which the Shadow.    I would endeavor to trace the lines of this image before it be for ever  lost, and to record, as far as I may, the warning which seems to me to  be uttered by every one of the fast-gaining waves, that beat, like  passing bells, against the STONES OF VENICE.    Sec. II. It would be difficult to overrate the value of the lessons which  might be derived from a faithful study of the history of this strange  and mighty city: a history which, in spite of the labor of countless  chroniclers, remains in vague and disputable outline,--barred with  brightness and shade, like the far away edge of her own ocean, where the  surf and the sand-bank are mingled with the sky. The inquiries in which  we have to engage will hardly render this outline clearer, but their  results will, in some degree, alter its aspect; and, so far as they bear  upon it at all, they possess an interest of a far higher kind than that  usually belonging to architectural investigations. I may, perhaps, in  the outset, and in few words, enable the general reader to form a  clearer idea of the importance of every existing expression of Venetian  character through Venetian art, and of the breadth of interest which the  true history of Venice embraces, than he is likely to have gleaned from  the current fables of her mystery or magnificence.    Sec. III. Venice is usually conceived as an oligarchy: She was so during  a period less than the half of her existence, and that including the days  of her decline; and it is one of the first questions needing severe  examination, whether that decline was owing in any wise to the change in  the form of her government, or altogether, as assuredly in great part,  to changes, in the character of the persons of whom it was composed.    The state of Venice existed Thirteen Hundred and Seventy-six years, from  the first establishment of a consular government on the island of the  Rialto,[1] to the moment when the General-in-chief of the French army of  Italy pronounced the Venetian republic a thing of the past. Of this  period, Two Hundred and Seventy-six[2] years were passed in a nominal  subjection to the cities of old Venetia, especially to Padua, and in an  agitated form of democracy, of which the executive appears to have been  entrusted to tribunes,[3] chosen, one by the inhabitants of each of the  principal islands. For six hundred years,[4] during which the power of  Venice was continually on the increase, her government was an elective  monarchy, her King or doge possessing, in early times at least, as much  independent authority as any other European sovereign, but an authority  gradually subjected to limitation, and shortened almost daily of its  prerogatives, while it increased in a spectral and incapable  magnificence. The final government of the nobles, under the image of a  king, lasted for five hundred years, during which Venice reaped the  fruits of her former energies, consumed them,--and expired.    Sec. IV. Let the reader therefore conceive the existence of the Venetian  state as broadly divided into two periods: the first of nine hundred,  the second of five hundred years, the separation being marked by what  was called the \"Serrar del Consiglio;\" that is to say, the final and  absolute distinction of the nobles from the commonalty, and the  establishment of the government in their hands to the exclusion alike of  the influence of the people on the one side, and the authority of the  doge on the other.    Then the first period, of nine hundred years, presents us with the most  interesting spectacle of a people struggling out of anarchy into order  and power; and then governed, for the most part, by the worthiest and  noblest man whom they could find among them,[5] called their Doge or  Leader, with an aristocracy gradually and resolutely forming itself  around him, out of which, and at last by which, he was chosen; an  aristocracy owing its origin to the accidental numbers, influence, and  wealth of some among the families of the fugitives from the older  Venetia, and gradually organizing itself, by its unity and heroism, into  a separate body.    This first period includes the rise of Venice, her noblest achievements,  and the circumstances which determined her character and position among  European powers; and within its range, as might have been anticipated,  we find the names of all her hero princes,--of Pietro Urseolo, Ordalafo  Falier, Domenico Michieli, Sebastiano Ziani, and Enrico Dandolo.    Sec. V. The second period opens with a hundred and twenty years, the  most eventful in the career of Venice--the central struggle of her  life--stained with her darkest crime, the murder of Carrara--disturbed  by her most dangerous internal sedition, the conspiracy of  Falier--oppressed by her most fatal war, the war of Chiozza--and  distinguished by the glory of her two noblest citizens (for in this  period the heroism of her citizens replaces that of her monarchs),  Vittor Pisani and Carlo Zeno.    I date the commencement of the Fall of Venice from the death of Carlo  Zeno, 8th May, 1418;[6] the _visible_ commencement from that of another  of her noblest and wisest children, the Doge Tomaso Mocenigo, who  expired five years later. The reign of Foscari followed, gloomy with  pestilence and war; a war in which large acquisitions of territory were  made by subtle or fortunate policy in Lombardy, and disgrace,  significant as irreparable, sustained in the battles on the Po at  Cremona, and in the marshes of Caravaggio. In 1454, Venice, the first of  the states of Christendom, humiliated herself to the Turk: in the same  year was established the Inquisition of State,[7] and from this period  her government takes the perfidious and mysterious form under which it  is usually conceived. In 1477, the great Turkish invasion spread terror  to the shores of the lagoons; and in 1508 the league of Cambrai marks  the period usually assigned as the commencement of the decline of the  Venetian power;[8] the commercial prosperity of Venice in the close of  the fifteenth century blinding her historians to the previous evidence  of the diminution of her internal strength.    Sec. VI. Now there is apparently a significative coincidence between the  establishment of the aristocratic and oligarchical powers, and the  diminution of the prosperity of the state. But this is the very question  at issue; and it appears to me quite undetermined by any historian, or  determined by each in accordance with his own prejudices. It is a triple  question: first, whether the oligarchy established by the efforts of  individual ambition was the cause, in its subsequent operation, of the  Fall of Venice; or (secondly) whether the establishment of the"]]]
