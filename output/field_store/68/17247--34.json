[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#3)"],[1,"is Altered\" there is clear ridicule in the character Antonio  Balladino of Anthony Munday, pageant-poet of the city, translator  of romances and playwright as well.  In \"Every Man in His Humour\"  there is certainly a caricature of Samuel Daniel, accepted poet of  the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of fashion.  These men  held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his talents better  entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies.  It seems  almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire  through \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" and \"Cynthia's Revels,\"  Daniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as  Puntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire  once more.  Jonson's literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again  and again, in the entertainments that welcomed King James on his  way to London, in the masques at court, and in the pastoral drama.  As to Jonson's personal ambitions with respect to these two men, it  is notable that he became, not pageant-poet, but chronologer to the  City of London; and that, on the accession of the new king, he came  soon to triumph over Daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty.    \"Cynthia's Revels,\" the second \"comical satire,\" was acted in 1600,  and, as a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible  than \"Every Man Out of His Humour.\"  Here personal satire seems to  have absorbed everything, and while much of the caricature is  admirable, especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly  satirical dialogue, the central idea of a fountain of self-love is  not very well carried out, and the persons revert at times to  abstractions, the action to allegory.  It adds to our wonder that  this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children of  Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom  Jonson read Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to  make plays.  Another of these precocious little actors was  Salathiel Pavy, who died before he was thirteen, already famed for  taking the parts of old men.  Him Jonson immortalised in one of the  sweetest of his epitaphs.  An interesting sidelight is this on the  character of this redoubtable and rugged satirist, that he should  thus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little  theatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had been literally  kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped  to the conning of their difficult parts.  To the caricature of  Daniel and Munday in \"Cynthia's Revels\" must be added Anaides  (impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),  interpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh.  Crites, like  Asper-Macilente in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" is Jonson's  self-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable,  and judicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the  yelping curs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny  attacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect.    The third and last of the \"comical satires\" is \"Poetaster,\" acted,  once more, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson's only  avowed contribution to the fray.  According to the author's own  account, this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that  his enemies had entrusted to Dekker the preparation of  \"Satiromastix, the Untrussing of the Humorous Poet,\" a dramatic  attack upon himself.  In this attempt to forestall his enemies  Jonson succeeded, and \"Poetaster\" was an immediate and deserved  success.  While hardly more closely knit in structure than its  earlier companion pieces, \"Poetaster\" is planned to lead up to the  ludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the  \"Lexiphanes\" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus,  is made to throw up the difficult words with which he had  overburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary.  In  the end Crispinus with his fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over  to keep the peace and never thenceforward \"malign, traduce, or  detract the person or writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson]  or any other eminent man transcending you in merit.\"  One of the  most diverting personages in Jonson's comedy is Captain Tucca.  \"His peculiarity\" has been well described by Ward as \"a buoyant  blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most  complete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a  walking dictionary of slang.\"    It was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his  reply, \"Satiromastix,\" and he amplified him, turning his abusive  vocabulary back upon Jonson and adding \"an immodesty to his  dialogue that did not enter into Jonson's conception.\"  It has been  held, altogether plausibly, that when Dekker was engaged  professionally, so to speak, to write a dramatic reply to Jonson,  he was at work on a species of chronicle history, dealing with the  story of Walter Terill in the reign of William Rufus.  This he  hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by  \"Poetaster,\" and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply.  The  absurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is the  result. But Dekker's play is not without its palpable hits at the  arrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of  Jonson-Horace, whose \"ningle\" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has  recently been shown to figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson's  friend, the poet Drayton.  Slight and hastily adapted as is  \"Satiromastix,\" especially in a comparison with the better wrought  and more significant satire of \"Poetaster,\" the town awarded the  palm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and Jonson gave over in consequence  his practice of \"comical satire.\"  Though Jonson was cited to  appear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer certain charges to  the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in  \"Poetaster,\" nothing came of this complaint.  It may be suspected  that much of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure  playing to the gallery.  The town was agog with the strife, and on  no less an authority than Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" ii. 2), we learn  that the children's company (acting the plays of Jonson) did \"so  berattle the common stages...that many, wearing rapiers, are afraid  of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.\"    Several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less  part in the war of the theatres.  Among them the most important is  a college play, entitled \"The Return from Parnassus,\" dating  1601-02.  In it a much-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a  character, declare: \"Why here's our fellow Shakespeare puts them  all down; aye and Ben Jonson, too.  O that Ben Jonson is a  pestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the poets a pill,  but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him  bewray his credit.\"  Was Shakespeare then concerned in this war of  the stages?  And what could have been the nature of this \"purge\"?  Among several suggestions, \"Troilus and Cressida\" has been thought  by some to be the play in which Shakespeare thus \"put down\" his  friend, Jonson.  A wiser interpretation finds the \"purge\" in  \"Satiromastix,\" which, though not written by Shakespeare, was  staged by his company, and therefore with his approval and under  his direction as one of the leaders of that company.    The last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised  as a dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to  him as a dramatic satirist.  But Jonson now turned his talents to  new fields.  Plays on subjects derived from classical story and  myth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama, so that  Shakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his \"Julius  Caesar\" about 1600.  Therefore when Jonson staged \"Sejanus,\" three  years later and with Shakespeare's company once more, he was only  following in the elder dramatist's footsteps.  But Jonson's idea of  a play on classical history, on the one hand, and Shakespeare's and  the elder popular dramatists, on the other, were very different.  Heywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the  stage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid and  dramatised with little taste or discrimination.  Shakespeare had a  finer conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his  ancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and dramatise  his subject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a  classical antiquarian.  He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness,  and wrote his \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius,  and other authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and  his atmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in  the margin when he came to print.  \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of  genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste  the story of the haughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical  overthrow.  Our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking  representation of ancient Roman life than may be found in Jonson's  \"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his Conspiracy,\" which followed in 1611.  A  passage in the address of the former play to the reader, in which  Jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version, has led to  the surmise that Shakespeare may have been that \"worthier pen.\"  There is no evidence to determine the matter.    In 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman and  Marston in the admirable comedy of London life entitled \"Eastward  Hoe.\"  In the previous year, Marston had dedicated his  \"Malcontent,\" in terms of fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the  wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed.  Between Jonson and Chapman there was the kinship of similar  scholarly ideals.  The two continued friends throughout life.  \"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary popularity represented"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4028"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (#3)"],[1,"began teaching me to play upon the flute and sing by note; by  notwithstanding I was of that tender age when little children are wont  to take pastime in whistles and such toys, I had an inexpressible  dislike for it, and played and sang only to obey him. My father in those  times fashioned wonderful organs with pipes of wood, spinets the fairest  and most excellent which then could be seen, viols and lutes and harps  of the most beautiful and perfect construction. He was an engineer, and  had marvellous skill in making instruments for lowering bridges and for  working mills, and other machines of that sort. In ivory he was the  first who wrought really well. But after he had fallen in love with the  woman who was destined to become my mother-perhaps what brought them  together was that little flute, to which indeed he paid more attention  than was proper-he was entreated by the fifers of the Signory to play in  their company. Accordingly he did so for some time to amuse himself,  until by constant importunity they induced him to become a member of  their band. Lorenzo de Medici and Pietro his son, who had a great  liking for him, perceived later on that he was devoting himself wholly  to the fife, and was neglecting his fine engineering talent and his  beautiful art. [1] So they had him removed from that post. My father  took this very ill, and it seemed to him that they had done him a great  despite. Yet he immediately resumed his art, and fashioned a mirror,  about a cubit in diameter, out of bone and ivory, with figures and  foliage of great finish and grand design. The mirror was in the form of  a wheel. In the middle was the looking-glass; around it were seven  circular pieces, on which were the Seven Virtues, carved and joined of  ivory and black bone. The whole mirror, together with the Virtues, was  placed in equilibrium, so that when the wheel turned, all the Virtues  moved, and they had weights at their feet which kept them upright.  Possessing some acquaintance with the Latin tongue, he put a legend in  Latin round his looking-glass, to this effect-Whithersoever the wheel  of Fortune turns, Virtue stands firm upon her feet:         Rota sum: semper, quoquo me verto, stat Virtus.    A little while after this he obtained his place again among the fifers.  Although some of these things happened before I was born, my familiarity  with them has moved me to set them down here. In those days the  musicians of the Signory were all of them members of the most honourable  trades, and some of them belonged to the greater guilds of silk and  wool; [2] and that was the reason why my father did not disdain to  follow this profession, and his chief desire with regard to me was  always that I should become a great performer on the flute. I for my  part felt never more discontented than when he chose to talk to me about  this scheme, and to tell me that, if I liked, he discerned in me such  aptitudes that I might become the best man in the world.    Note 1. The Medici here mentioned were Lorenzo the Magnificent, and his  son Pietro, who was expelled from Florence in the year 1494. He never  returned, but died in the river Garigliano in 1504.    Note 2. In the Middle Ages the burghers of Florence were divided into  industrial guilds called the Greater and the Lesser Arts. The former  took precedence of the latter, both in political importance and in  social esteem.    VI    AS I have said, my father was the devoted servant and attached friend of  the house of Medici; and when Piero was banished, he entrusted him with  many affairs of the greatest possible importance. Afterwards, when the  magnificent Piero Soderini was elected, and my father continued in his  office of musician, Soderini, perceiving his wonderful talent, began to  employ him in many matters of great importance as an engineer. [1] So  long as Soderini remained in Florence, he showed the utmost good-will to  my father; and in those days, I being still of tender age, my father had  me carried, and made me perform upon the flute; I used to play treble in  concert with the musicians of the palace before the Signory, following  my notes: and a beadle used to carry me upon his shoulders. The  Gonfalonier, that is, Soderini, whom I have already mentioned, took much  pleasure in making me chatter, and gave me comfits, and was wont to say  to my father: Maestro Giovanni, besides music, teach the boy those  other arts which do you so much honour. To which my father answered: I  do not wish him to practise any art but playing and composing; for in  this profession I hope to make him the greatest man of the world, if God  prolongs his life. To these words one of the old counsellors made  answer: Ah! Maestro Giovanni, do what the Gonfalonier tells you! for  why should he never become anything more than a good musician?    Thus some time passed, until the Medici returned. [2] When they arrived,  the Cardinal, who afterwards became Pope Leo, received my father very  kindly. During their exile the scutcheons which were on the palace of  the Medici had had their balls erased, and a great red cross painted  over them, which was the bearing of the Commune. [3] Accordingly, as  soon as they returned, the red cross was scratched out, and on the  scutcheon the red balls and the golden field were painted in again, and  finished with great beauty. My father, who possessed a simple vein of  poetry, instilled in him by nature, together with a certain touch of  prophecy, which was doubtless a divine gift in him, wrote these four  verses under the said arms of the Medici, when they were uncovered to  the view:-         These arms, which have so long from sight been laid         Beneath the holy cross, that symbol meek,         Now lift their glorious glad face, and seek       With Peters sacred cloak to be arrayed.    This epigram was read by all Florence. A few days afterwards Pope Julius  II. died. The Cardinal de Medici went to Rome, and was elected Pope  against the expectation of everybody. He reigned as Leo X, that generous  and great soul. My father sent him his four prophetic verses. The Pope  sent to tell him to come to Rome; for this would be to his advantage.  But he had no will to go; and so, in lieu of reward, his place in the  palace was taken from him by Jacopo Salviati, upon that mans election  as Gonfalonier. [4] This was the reason why I commenced goldsmith; after  which I spent part of my time in learning that art, and part in playing,  much against my will.    Note 1. Piero Soderini was elected Gonfalonier of the Florentine  Republic for life in the year 1502. After nine years of government, he  was banished, and when he died, Machiavelli wrote the famous sneering  epitaph upon him. See J. A. Symonds 'Renaissance in Italy,' vol. i. p.  297.    Note 2. This was in 1512, when Lorenzos two sons, Giuliano and Giovanni  (afterwards Pope Leo X), came back through the aid of a Spanish army,  after the great battle at Ravenna.    Note 3. The Medicean arms were or, six pellets gules, three, two, and  one. The Florentine Commune bore, argent a cross gules.    Note 4. Cellini makes a mistake here. Salviati married a daughter of  Lorenzo de Medici, and obtained great influence in Florence; but we  have no record of his appointment to the office of Gonfalonier.    VII    WHEN my father spoke to me in the way I have above described, I  entreated him to let me draw a certain fixed number of hours in the day;  all the rest of my time I would give to music, only with the view of  satisfying his desire. Upon this he said to me: So then, you take no  pleasure in playing? To which I answered, No; because that art seemed  too base in comparison with what I had in my own mind. My good father,  driven to despair by this fixed idea of mine, placed me in the workshop  of Cavaliere Bandinellos father, who was called Michel Agnolo, a  goldsmith from Pinzi di Monte, and a master excellent in that craft. [1]  He had no distinction of birth whatever, but was the son of a  charcoal-seller. This is no blame to Bandinello, who has founded the  honour of the family-if only he had done so honestly! However that may  be, I have no cause now to talk about him. After I had stayed there some  days, my father took me away from Michel Agnolo, finding himself unable  to live without having me always under his eyes. Accordingly, much to my  discontent, I remained at music till I reached the age of fifteen. If I  were to describe all the wonderful things that happened to me up to that  time, and all the great dangers to my own life which I ran, I should  astound my readers; but, in order to avoid prolixity, and having very  much to relate, I will omit these incidents.    When I reached the age of fifteen, I put myself, against my fathers  will, to the goldsmiths trade with a man called Antonio, son of Sandro,  known commonly as Marcone the goldsmith. He was a most excellent  craftsman and a very good fellow to boot, high-spirited and frank in all  his ways. My father would not let him give me wages like the other  apprentices; for having taken up the study of this art to please myself,  he wished me to indulge my whim for drawing to the full. I did so  willingly enough; and that honest master of mine took marvellous delight  in my performances. He had an only son, a bastard, to whom he often gave  his orders, in order to spare me. My liking for the art was so great,  or, I may truly say, my natural bias, both one and the other, that in a  few months I caught up the good, nay, the best young craftsmen in our  business, and began to reap the fruits of my labours. I did not,  however, neglect to gratify my good father from time to time by playing  on the flute or cornet. Each time he heard me, I used to make his tears  fall accompanied with deep-drawn sighs of satisfaction. My filial piety  often made me give him that contentment, and induce me to pretend that I"]]]
