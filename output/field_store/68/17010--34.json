For a  moment he stood as though gathering strength, then doggedly started  forth upon that quest which he had set upon himself.    At the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness,  and there Master Nicholas, his cousin, met him; for the steward had sent  one of the retainers to tell the old man what the Baron was about to do.    \"Thou must go back again, Conrad,\" said Master Nicholas; \"thou art not  fit to be abroad.\"    The Baron answered him never a word, but he glared at him from out of  his bloodshot eyes and ground his teeth together. Then he started forth  again upon his way.    Down the long hall he went, slowly and laboriously, the others following  silently behind him, then up the steep winding stairs, step by step,  now and then stopping to lean against the wall. So he reached a long  and gloomy passageway lit only by the light of a little window at the  further end.    He stopped at the door of one of the rooms that opened into this  passage-way, stood for a moment, then he pushed it open.    No one was within but old Ursela, who sat crooning over a fire with a  bundle upon her knees. She did not see the Baron or know that he was  there.    \"Where is your lady?\" said he, in a hollow voice.    Then the old nurse looked up with a start. \"Jesu bless us,\" cried she,  and crossed herself.    \"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron again, in the same hoarse voice;  and then, not waiting for an answer, \"Is she dead?\"    The old woman looked at him for a minute blinking her watery eyes, and  then suddenly broke into a shrill, long-drawn wail. The Baron needed to  hear no more.    As though in answer to the old woman's cry, a thin piping complaint came  from the bundle in her lap.    At the sound the red blood flashed up into the Baron's face. \"What  is that you have there?\" said he, pointing to the bundle upon the old  woman's knees.    She drew back the coverings and there lay a poor, weak, little baby,  that once again raised its faint reedy pipe.    \"It is your son,\" said Ursela, \"that the dear Baroness left behind her  when the holy angels took her to Paradise. She blessed him and called  him Otto before she left us.\"          IV. The White Cross on the Hill.    Here the glassy waters of the River Rhine, holding upon its bosom a  mimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds floating above, runs  smoothly around a jutting point of land, St. Michaelsburg, rising from  the reedy banks of the stream, sweeps up with a smooth swell until  it cuts sharp and clear against the sky. Stubby vineyards covered its  earthy breast, and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow, where  lay the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg--\"The White Cross on the Hill.\"  There within the white walls, where the warm yellow sunlight slept, all  was peaceful quietness, broken only now and then by the crowing of  the cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen, the lowing of kine or the  bleating of goats, a solitary voice in prayer, the faint accord of  distant singing, or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the  high-peaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth,  far-winding stream. No other sounds broke the stillness, for in this  peaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor, the ring of iron-shod  hoofs, or the hoarse call to arms.    All men were not wicked and cruel and fierce in that dark, far-away age;  all were not robbers and terror-spreading tyrants, even in that time  when men's hands were against their neighbors, and war and rapine dwelt  in place of peace and justice.    Abbot Otto, of St. Michaelsburg, was a gentle, patient, pale-faced old  man; his white hands were soft and smooth, and no one would have thought  that they could have known the harsh touch of sword-hilt and lance. And  yet, in the days of the Emperor Frederick--the grandson of the great  Red-beard--no one stood higher in the prowess of arms than he. But all  at once--for why, no man could tell--a change came over him, and in the  flower of his youth and fame and growing power he gave up everything  in life and entered the quiet sanctuary of that white monastery on the  hill-side, so far away from the tumult and the conflict of the world in  which he had lived.    Some said that it was because the lady he had loved had loved his  brother, and that when they were married Otto of Wolbergen had left the  church with a broken heart.    But such stories are old songs that have been sung before.    Clatter! clatter! Jingle! jingle! It was a full-armed knight that came  riding up the steep hill road that wound from left to right and right to  left amid the vineyards on the slopes of St. Michaelsburg. Polished helm  and corselet blazed in the noon sunlight, for no knight in those days  dared to ride the roads except in full armor. In front of him the  solitary knight carried a bundle wrapped in the folds of his coarse gray  cloak.    It was a sorely sick man that rode up the heights of St. Michaelsburg.  His head hung upon his breast through the faintness of weariness and  pain; for it was the Baron Conrad.    He had left his bed of sickness that morning, had saddled his horse in  the gray dawn with his own hands, and had ridden away into the misty  twilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the  porter, who, winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken  slumber, had opened the gates to the sick man, hardly knowing what he  was doing, until he beheld his master far away, clattering down the  steep bridle-path.    Eight leagues had he ridden that day with neither a stop nor a stay; but  now at last the end of his journey had come, and he drew rein under the  shade of the great wooden gateway of St. Michaelsburg.    He reached up to the knotted rope and gave it a pull, and from within  sounded the answering ring of the porter's bell. By and by a little  wicket opened in the great wooden portals, and the gentle, wrinkled face  of old Brother Benedict, the porter, peeped out at the strange iron-clad  visitor and the great black war-horse, streaked and wet with the sweat  of the journey, flecked and dappled with flakes of foam. A few words  passed between them, and then the little window was closed again; and  within, the shuffling pat of the sandalled feet sounded fainter and  fainter, as Brother Benedict bore the message from Baron Conrad to Abbot  Otto, and the mail-clad figure was left alone, sitting there as silent  as a statue.    By and by the footsteps sounded again; there came a noise of clattering  chains and the rattle of the key in the lock, and the rasping of the  bolts dragged back. Then the gate swung slowly open, and Baron Conrad  rode into the shelter of the White Cross, and as the hoofs of his  war-horse clashed upon the stones of the courtyard within, the wooden  gate swung slowly to behind him.    Abbot Otto stood by the table when Baron Conrad entered the high-vaulted  room from the farther end. The light from the oriel window behind the  old man shed broken rays of light upon him, and seemed to frame his thin  gray hairs with a golden glory. His white, delicate hand rested upon the  table beside him, and upon some sheets of parchment covered with rows of  ancient Greek writing which he had been engaged in deciphering.    Clank! clank! clank! Baron Conrad strode across the stone floor, and  then stopped short in front of the good old man.    \"What dost thou seek here, my son?\" said the Abbot.    \"I seek sanctuary for my son and thy brother's grandson,\" said the Baron  Conrad, and he flung back the folds of his cloak and showed the face of  the sleeping babe.    For a while the Abbot said nothing, but stood gazing dreamily at  the baby. After a while he looked up. \"And the child's mother,\" said  he--\"what hath she to say at this?\"    \"She hath naught to say,\" said Baron Conrad, hoarsely, and then stopped  short in his speech. \"She is dead,\" said he, at last, in a husky voice,  \"and is with God's angels in paradise.\"    The Abbot looked intently in the Baron's face. \"So!\" said he, under his  breath, and then for the first time noticed how white and drawn was the  Baron's face. \"Art sick thyself?\" he asked.    \"Ay,\" said the Baron, \"I have come from death's door. But that is no  matter. Wilt thou take this little babe into sanctuary? My house is a  vile, rough place, and not fit for such as he, and his mother with the  blessed saints in heaven.\" And once more Conrad of Drachenhausen's face  began twitching with the pain of his thoughts.    \"Yes,\" said the old man, gently, \"he shall live here,\" and he stretched  out his hands and took the babe. \"Would,\" said he, \"that all the little  children in these dark times might be thus brought to the house of God,  and there learn mercy and peace, instead of rapine and war.\"    For a while he stood looking down in silence at the baby in his arms,  but with his mind far away upon other things. At last he roused himself  with a start. \"And thou,\" said he to the Baron Conrad--\"hath not thy  heart been chastened and softened by this? Surely thou wilt not go back  to thy old life of rapine and extortion?\"    \"Nay,\" said Baron Conrad, gruffly, \"I will rob the city swine no longer,  for that was the last thing that my dear one asked of me.\"    The old Abbot's face lit up with a smile. \"I am right glad that thy  heart was softened, and that thou art willing at last to cease from war  and violence.\"    \"Nay,\" cried the Baron, roughly, \"I said nothing of ceasing from war. By  heaven, no! I will have revenge!\" And he clashed his iron foot upon the  floor and clinched his fists and ground his teeth together. \"Listen,\"  said he, \"and I will tell thee how my troubles happened. A fortnight ago  I rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the  valley of Gruenhoffen. They outnumbered us many to one, but city swine  such as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28659"],[0,"The Acts of Uniformity: Their Scope and Effect (#3)"],[1,"  however, in the Declaration of Breda, had intimated  in some ambiguous words that no attempt should be  made to compel conformity. [22] The presbyterian divines,  Reynolds, Calamy and others, who waited upon him  in Holland, begged him not to insist on the use of the  Prayer-book, even in his own chapel. He refused  their request, replying that      though he was bound for the present to tolerate much    disorder and undecency in the exercise of God's worship,    he would never in the least degree, by his own practice,    discountenance the good old Order of the Church, in    which he had been bred. [23]    The discussions that followed the Restoration  turned chiefly on the question of church-government,  with which I am not concerned, except so  far as to point out that until the powers of the  bishops were thoroughly re-established they were  practically unable to enforce, by spiritual censures,  the use of the prescript order of divine worship. Still  it remained as prescribed, and was gradually returning  to general use.    In October, 1660, the divines of the presbyterian  party once more approached the King with suggestions  for a settlement of uniform practice. In regard to the  Liturgy, they had no objection to a fixed form imposed  by law, provided it was not too rigorously  insisted upon; but to the forms contained in the Prayer-book  they were rootedly opposed. The King seized  the opportunity, and in his declaration of October 25  undertook to appoint a committee of divines of both  persuasions to review the Book; in the mean while,  he wrote---      Our will and pleasure is, that none be punished or    troubled for not using it, until it be reviewed, and    effectually reformed. [24]    On the 25th of March following were issued Letters  Patent for the committee thus promised. The conferences  held at the Savoy were, however, practically  fruitless, and the committee was dissolved by lapse of  time on the 24th of July. In the mean time, however,  the Convocation of the province of Canterbury had  been busy. Meeting on the 8th of May, 1661, the  Synod drew up a form of prayer for the 29th of May,  the anniversary of the Restoration, and also an office  for the baptism of adults, which was approved on the  31st of May. [25] In another group of sessions beginning  on the 21st of November, the Synod, in accordance with  letters of business received from the Crown, took in  hand an exhaustive revision of the Prayer-book. This  was completed on the 20th of December, when a fair  copy of the Book as revised was subscribed by the  whole Synod. [26]    All this was done without the consent or concurrence  of Parliament. The Commons became suspicious.  Action under the statute of Elizabeth was  suspended by royal command, and the Convocations  were proceeding as if it were no longer in force. On  June 25, 1661, a committee of the House of Commons  was appointed      to view the several laws for confirming the Liturgy of    the Church of England, and to make search, whether    the original Book of the Liturgy annexed to the Act    passed in the fifth and sixth years of the reign of King    Edward the Sixth, be yet extant; and to bring in a    compendious Bill to supply any defect in the former    laws, and to provide for an effectual conformity to the    Liturgy of the Church, for the time to come. [27]    This resolution begins the history of the fourth and  last Act of Uniformity, which deserves a detailed  examination. A Bill was introduced on June 29, and  since the original Book could not be found, a printed  copy of the year 1604 was annexed. It was read a  third time on July 9, and sent up to the Lords. [28]  Nothing more was heard of it for several months.  The object of the Commons was simply to enforce  with greater efficacy the existing law. But this would  have rendered futile the labours of Convocation in  revising the Prayer-book. The use of the revised  Book would be forbidden under penalty. The Lords  therefore held their hand. The Bill sent up from the  Commons was at length read the first time on January  14, 1662. Three days later it was read a second time  and committed. [29] The committee met several times  and adjourned, waiting until they might see the revised  Book prepared by Convocation. [30] At length, on  February 24, this Book, certified under the Great  Seal, was sent by the King to the House of Lords.  On March 13 the committee reported the Bill with  several amendments and additions. Before these were  considered, the alterations in the Book were read over  to the House, but not in any way discussed, and a vote  of thanks to the Convocation for the pains taken in  the matter was adopted. [31] On April 9 the Bill passed  the third reading, with the revised Book annexed in  place of the former printed copy, and so was returned  to the Commons. [32]    Meanwhile the Convocation had, on March 5,  commissioned three bishops to watch any alterations  which might be imported into the Book by either  House of Parliament. [33] On April 15 the Commons  appointed a committee to compare the revised Book  with the copy of 1604, and on the following day, upon  the report of the committee, resolved by a narrow  majority not to allow any debate on the alterations  made. They reserved, however, the right to do so  had they wished. [34] The clauses of the Bill were carefully  gone through; a proviso inserted by the Lords,  that no man should be deprived for not using the  surplice or the Cross in Baptism, was thrown out; [35]  several amendments were carried, and a conference of  the two Houses was held for their consideration. [36]    On this occasion occurred two most significant  incidents. The first arose out of the wish of the  Commons to insert a proviso for      reverend and uniform gestures and demeanours to be    enjoined at the time of divine service.    It was agreed in Conference that this matter was more  proper for Convocation than for Parliament, and, therefore,  by a vote of the House of Lords, Convocation  was requested      to prepare some canon or rule for that purpose, to be    humbly presented unto his majesty for his assent. [37]    The other incident arose from the discovery of the  Commons' committee that in one of the rubrics of the  revised Book the word _persons_ appeared to be written  by mistake for _children_. On this      the Lord Bishop of Durham acquainted the House that    himself, and the Lord Bishop of St. Asaph, and the    Lord Bishop of Carlisle, had authority from the Convocation    to mend the said word, averring it was only a mistake    of the scribe, and accordingly they came to the    clerk's table, and amended the same. [38]    In fact, on April 21, the bishops in Convocation had  heard from the Chancellor of the mistake, and had  taken measures accordingly, adding Cosin of Durham  to their committee of March 5 appointed for such  an emergency. [39]    The Act received the royal assent on May 19.  I have dealt so fully with its course through Parliament  because of the character of the incidents. In  itself it does not contain much that is new as regards  my subject. The preamble recites the statute of  Elizabeth, and relates the fact of its non-observance,  and the neglect of the Book of Common Prayer during  the late troublous times; takes note of the King's  commission for the review of the Book and its subsequent  revision by Convocation; and records the  message in which the King recommended to Parliament  that the Book so revised should \"be the Book\"  appointed to be used everywhere in the kingdom.  This accordingly is enacted, and in the twenty-fourth  section all the existing laws on the subject, including  of course the statute of Elizabeth, are confirmed as  referring to the revised Book and none other. The  revised Book, as in 1552, is thus put in exactly the  same legal position as the original, and the authentic  copy, as on that occasion, is, for the purpose of  reference, annexed and joined to the Act. The other  lengthy clauses of the Act contain elaborate provisions  for preventing nonconformity, but with one exception  they do not throw any further light on the relation of  the legislature to the Prayer-book. The exception is  the fifteenth section, which provides      that the penalties in this Act shall not extend to the    Foreiners or Aliens of the Forein Reformed Churches    allowed, or to be allowed by the King's Majesty, his    heirs and successors, in England.    An exception which had hitherto been made, as we have  seen, by a stretch of prerogative, was now established  by law. The exception illustrates the purpose of the  Act. No sect or congregation of native-born dissenters  was to be allowed any relief from the penalties imposed  by law. The guarded promise of toleration made by  the King before and after his restoration was ignored.  The use of the forms of worship provided by the  authorities of the Church was to be forced on the  whole nation.    The conclusion that I would draw from this  analysis of proceedings will be fairly obvious. The  Prayer-book did not originate with Parliament, nor  was it in any true sense authorized by the Crown in  Parliament. The action of the legislature on the first  and the last occasion is perfectly intelligible. A Book  of Common Prayer was in existence, drawn up and  approved by ecclesiastical authority, on the first  occasion it is not quite clear after what fashion, on the  last occasion by the unquestioned exercise of synodical  powers. This Book, so approved, was then, by  authority of Parliament, imposed upon the whole  nation. This being clearly the case on the two  occasions when the procedure is free from ambiguity,  I think we may fairly argue for the same construction  of those proceedings, on the other two occasions, which  are more open to question. The policy of the Acts  of Uniformity is to be taken as a whole. The writer  of the paper in the Record Office to"]]]
