At some points the lofty trees of the primeval  forest grew down to the water's edge. The river at every high tide  overflowed great meadows grown up in reeds and grasses and red and  yellow flowers, stretching back to the borders of the forest and full  of water birds and wild fowl of every variety. Penn, now in the prime of  life, must surely have been aroused by this scene and by the reflection  that the noble river was his and the vast stretches of forests and  mountains for three hundred miles to the westward.    He was soon ashore, exploring the edge of his mighty domain, settling  his government, and passing his laws. He was much pleased with the  Swedes whom he found on his land. He changed the name of the little  Swedish village of Upland, fifteen miles below Philadelphia, to Chester.  He superintended laying out the streets of Philadelphia and they remain  to this day substantially as he planned them, though unfortunately too  narrow and monotonously regular. He met the Indians at Philadelphia, sat  with them at their fires, ate their roasted corn, and when to amuse him  they showed him some of their sports and games he renewed his college  days by joining them in a jumping match.    Then he started on journeys. He traveled through the woods to New York,  which then belonged to the Duke of York, who had given him Delaware; he  visited the Long Island Quakers; and on his return he went to Maryland  to meet with much pomp and ceremony Lord Baltimore and there discuss  with him the disputed boundary. He even crossed to the eastern shore of  the Chesapeake to visit a Quaker meeting on the Choptank before winter  set in, and he describes the immense migration of wild pigeons at  that season, and the ducks which flew so low and were so tame that the  colonists knocked them down with sticks.    Most of the winter he spent at Chester and wrote to England in high  spirits of his journeys, the wonders of the country, the abundance of  game and provisions, and the twenty-three ships which had arrived so  swiftly that few had taken longer than six weeks, and only three had  been infected with the smallpox. \"Oh how sweet,\" he says, \"is the quiet  of these parts, freed from the anxious and troublesome solicitations,  hurries and perplexities of woful Europe.\"    As the weeks and months passed, ships kept arriving with more Quakers,  far exceeding the migration to the Jerseys. By summer, Penn reported  that 50 sail had arrived within the past year, 80 houses had been built  in Philadelphia, and about 300 farms had been laid out round the town.  It is supposed that about 8000 immigrants had arrived. This was a  more rapid development than was usual in the colonies of America.  Massachusetts and Virginia had been established slowly and with much  privation and suffering. But the settlement of Philadelphia was like a  summer outing. There were no dangers, the hardships were trifling, and  there was no sickness or famine. There was such an abundance of game  close at hand that hunger and famine were in nowise to be feared. The  climate was good and the Indians, kindly treated, remained friendly for  seventy years.    It is interesting to note that in that same year, 1682, in which Penn  and his friends with such ease and comfort founded their great colony  on the Delaware, the French explorers and voyageurs from Canada, after  years of incredible hardships, had traversed the northern region of the  Great Lakes with their canoes and had passed down the Mississippi to its  mouth, giving to the whole of the Great West the name of Louisiana, and  claiming it for France. Already La Salle had taken his fleet of canoes  down the Mississippi River and had placed the arms of France on a post  at its mouth in April, 1682, only a few months before Penn reached  his newly acquired colony. Thus in the same year in which the Quakers  established in Pennsylvania their reign of liberty and of peace with  the red men, La Salle was laying the foundation of the western empire of  despotic France, which seventy years afterwards was to hurl the savages  upon the English colonies, to wreck the Quaker policy of peace, but to  fail in the end to maintain itself against the free colonies of England.    While they were building houses in Philadelphia, the settlers lived in  bark huts or in caves dug in the river bank, as the early settlers  in New Jersey across the river had lived. Pastorius, a learned German  Quaker, who had come out with the English, placed over the door of his  cave the motto, \"Parva domus, sed amica bonis, procul este profani,\"  which much amused Penn when he saw it. A certain Mrs. Morris was much  exercised one day as to how she could provide supper in the cave for  her husband who was working on the construction of their house. But on  returning to her cave she found that her cat had just brought in a fine  rabbit. In their later prosperous years they had a picture of the cat  and the rabbit made on a box which has descended as a family heirloom.  Doubtless there were preserved many other interesting reminiscences of  the brief camp life. These Quakers were all of the thrifty, industrious  type which had gone to West Jersey a few years before. Men of means,  indeed, among the Quakers were the first to seek refuge from the fines  and confiscations imposed upon them in England. They brought with them  excellent supplies of everything. Many of the ships carried the frames  of houses ready to put together. But substantial people of this  sort demanded for the most part houses of brick, with stone cellars.  Fortunately both brick clay and stone were readily obtainable in the  neighborhood, and whatever may have been the case in other colonies,  ships loaded with brick from England would have found it little to their  profit to touch at Philadelphia. An early description says that the  brick houses in Philadelphia were modeled on those of London, and this  type prevailed for nearly two hundred years.    It was probably in June, 1683, that Penn made his famous treaty with  the Indians. No documentary proof of the existence of such a treaty has  reached us. He made, indeed, a number of so-called treaties, which  were really only purchases of land involving oral promises between the  principals to treat each other fairly. Hundreds of such treaties have  been made. The remarkable part about Penn's dealings with the Indians  was that such promises as he made he kept. The other Quakers, too, were  as careful as Penn in their honorable treatment of the red men.  Quaker families of farmers and settlers lived unarmed among them for  generations and, when absent from home, left children in their care. The  Indians, on their part, were known to have helped white families with  food in winter time. Penn, on his first visit to the colony, made a long  journey unarmed among the Indians as far as the Susquehanna, saw the  great herds of elk on that river, lived in Indian wigwams, and learned  much of the language and customs of the natives. There need never be any  trouble with them, he said. They were the easiest people in the world to  get on with if the white men would simply be just. Penn's fair treatment  of the Indians kept Pennsylvania at peace with them for about seventy  years--in fact, from 1682 until the outbreak of the French and Indian  Wars, in 1755. In its critical period of growth, Pennsylvania was  therefore not at all harassed or checked by those Indian hostilities  which were such a serious impediment in other colonies.    The two years of Penn's first visit were probably the happiest of his  life. Always fond of the country, he built himself a fine seat on  the Delaware near Bristol, and it would have been better for him, and  probably also for the colony, if he had remained there. But he thought  he had duties in England: his family needed him; he must defend  his people from the religious oppression still prevailing; and Lord  Baltimore had gone to England to resist him in the boundary dispute. One  of the more narrow-minded of his faith wrote to Penn from England that  he was enjoying himself too much in his colony and seeking his own  selfish interest. Influenced by all these considerations, he returned  in August, 1684, and it was long before he saw Pennsylvania again--not,  indeed, until October, 1699, and then for only two years.        Chapter III. Life In Philadelphia    The rapid increase of population and the growing prosperity in  Pennsylvania during the life of its founder present a striking contrast  to the slower and more troubled growth of the other British colonies  in America. The settlers in Pennsylvania engaged at once in profitable  agriculture. The loam, clay, and limestone soils on the Pennsylvania  tide of the Delaware produced heavy crops of grain, as well as pasture  for cattle and valuable lumber from its forests. The Pennsylvania  settlers were of a class particularly skilled in dealing with the soil.  They apparently encountered none of the difficulties, due probably to  incompetent farming, which beset the settlers of Delaware, whose land  was as good as that of the Pennsylvania colonists.    In a few years the port of Philadelphia was loading abundant cargoes for  England and the great West India trade. After much experimenting with  different places on the river, such as New Castle, Wilmington, Salem,  Burlington, the Quakers had at last found the right location for a great  seat of commerce and trade that could serve as a center for the export  of everything from the region behind it and around it. Philadelphia thus  soon became the basis of a prosperity which no other townsite on the  Delaware had been able to attain. The Quakers of Philadelphia were the  soundest of financiers and men of business, and in their skillful hands  the natural resources of their colony were developed without setback  or accident. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#3)"],[1,"of what we could see  of the battle then was the remarkable number of cartridges the Greek  soldiers wasted in firing into space, and the fact that they had begun to  fire at such long range that, in order to get the elevation, they had  placed the rifle butt under the armpit instead of against the shoulder.  Their sights were at the top notch.  The cartridges reminded one of  corn-cobs jumping out of a corn-sheller, and it was interesting when the  bolts were shot back to see a hundred of them pop up into the air at the  same time, flashing in the sun as though they were glad to have done  their work and to get out again.  They rolled by the dozens underfoot,  and twinkled in the grass, and when one shifted his position in the  narrow trench, or stretched his cramped legs, they tinkled musically.  It  was like wading in a gutter filled with thimbles.    Then there began a concert which came from just overhead--a concert of  jarring sounds and little whispers.  The \"shrieking shrapnel,\" of which  one reads in the description of every battle, did not seem so much like a  shriek as it did like the jarring sound of telegraph wires when some one  strikes the pole from which they hang, and when they came very close the  noise was like the rushing sound that rises between two railroad trains  when they pass each other in opposite directions and at great speed.  After a few hours we learned by observation that when a shell sang  overhead it had already struck somewhere else, which was comforting, and  which was explained, of course, by the fact that the speed of the shell  is so much greater than the rate at which sound travels.  The bullets  were much more disturbing; they seemed to be less open in their warfare,  and to steal up and sneak by, leaving no sign, and only to whisper as  they passed.  They moved under a cloak of invisibility, and made one feel  as though he were the blind man in a game of blind-man's-buff, where  every one tapped him in passing, leaving him puzzled and ignorant as to  whither they had gone and from what point they would come next.  The  bullets sounded like rustling silk, or like humming-birds on a warm  summer's day, or like the wind as it is imitated on the stage of a  theatre.  Any one who has stood behind the scenes when a storm is  progressing on the stage, knows the little wheel wound with silk that  brushes against another piece of silk, and which produces the whistling  effect of the wind.  At Velestinos, when the firing was very heavy, it  was exactly as though some one were turning one of these silk wheels, and  so rapidly as to make the whistling continuous.    When this concert opened, the officers shouted out new orders, and each  of the men shoved his sight nearer to the barrel, and when he fired  again, rubbed the butt of his gun snugly against his shoulder.  The huge  green blotches on the plain had turned blue, and now we could distinguish  that they moved, and that they were moving steadily forward.  Then they  would cease to move, and a little later would be hidden behind great  puffs of white smoke, which were followed by a flash of flame; and still  later there would come a dull report.  At the same instant something  would hurl itself jarring through the air above our heads, and by turning  on one elbow we could see a sudden upheaval in the sunny landscape behind  us, a spurt of earth and stones like a miniature geyser, which was filled  with broken branches and tufts of grass and pieces of rock.  As the  Turkish aim grew better these volcanoes appeared higher up the hill,  creeping nearer and nearer to the rampart of fresh earth on the second  trench until the shells hammered it at last again and again, sweeping it  away and cutting great gashes in it, through which we saw the figures of  men caught up and hurled to one side, and others flinging themselves face  downward as though they were diving into water; and at the same instant  in our own trench the men would gasp as though they had been struck too,  and then becoming conscious of having done this would turn and smile  sheepishly at each other, and crawl closer into the burrows they had made  in the earth.                   [Picture: A mountain battery at Velestinos]    From where we sat on the edge of the trench, with our feet among the  cartridges, we could, by leaning forward, look over the piled-up earth  into the plain below, and soon, without any aid from field-glasses, we  saw the blocks of blue break up into groups of men.  These men came  across the ploughed fields in long, widely opened lines, walking easily  and leisurely, as though they were playing golf or sowing seed in the  furrows.    The Greek rifles crackled and flashed at the lines, but the men below  came on quite steadily, picking their way over the furrows and appearing  utterly unconscious of the seven thousand rifles that were calling on  them to halt.  They were advancing directly toward a little sugar-loaf  hill, on the top of which was a mountain battery perched like a tiara on  a woman's head.  It was throwing one shell after another in the very path  of the men below, but the Turks still continued to pick their way across  the field, without showing any regard for the mountain battery.  It was  worse than threatening; it seemed almost as though they meant to insult  us.  If they had come up on a run they would not have appeared so  contemptuous, for it would have looked then as though they were trying to  escape the Greek fire, or that they were at least interested in what was  going forward.  But the steady advance of so many men, each plodding  along by himself, with his head bowed and his gun on his shoulder, was  aggravating.    There was a little village at the foot of the hill.  It was so small that  no one had considered it.  It was more like a collection of stables  gathered round a residence than a town, and there was a wall completely  encircling it, with a gate in the wall that faced us.  Suddenly the doors  of this gate were burst open from the inside, and a man in a fez ran  through them, followed by many more.  The first man was waving a sword,  and a peasant in petticoats ran at his side and pointed up with his hand  at our trench.  Until that moment the battle had lacked all human  interest; we might have been watching a fight against the stars or the  man in the moon, and, in spite of the noise and clatter of the Greek  rifles, and the ghostlike whispers and the rushing sounds in the air,  there was nothing to remind us of any other battle of which we had heard  or read.  But we had seen pictures of officers waving swords, and we knew  that the fez was the sign of the Turk--of the enemy--of the men who were  invading Thessaly, who were at that moment planning to come up a steep  hill on which we happened to be sitting and attack the people on top of  it.  And the spectacle at once became comprehensible, and took on the  human interest it had lacked.  The men seemed to feel this, for they  sprang up and began cheering and shouting, and fired in an upright  position, and by so doing exposed themselves at full length to the fire  from the men below.  The Turks in front of the village ran back into it  again, and those in the fields beyond turned and began to move away, but  in that same plodding, aggravating fashion.  They moved so leisurely that  there was a pause in the noise along the line, while the men watched them  to make sure that they were really retreating.  And then there was a long  cheer, after which they all sat down, breathing deeply, and wiping the  sweat and dust across their faces, and took long pulls at their canteens.    The different trenches were not all engaged at the same time.  They acted  according to the individual judgment of their commanding officer, but  always for the general good.  Sometimes the fire of the enemy would be  directed on one particular trench, and it would be impossible for the men  in that trench to rise and reply without haying their heads carried away;  so they would lie hidden, and the men in the trenches flanking them would  act in their behalf, and rake the enemy from the front and from every  side, until the fire on that trench was silenced, or turned upon some  other point.  The trenches stretched for over half a mile in a  semicircle, and the little hills over which they ran lay at so many  different angles, and rose to such different heights, that sometimes the  men in one trench fired directly over the heads of their own men.  From  many trenches in the first line it was impossible to see any of the Greek  soldiers except those immediately beside you.  If you looked back or  beyond on either hand there was nothing to be seen but high hills topped  with fresh earth, and the waving yellow grass, and the glaring blue sky.    General Smolenski directed the Greeks from the plain to the far right of  the town; and his presence there, although none of the men saw nor heard  of him directly throughout the entire day, was more potent for good than  would have been the presence of five thousand other men held in reserve.  He was a mile or two miles away from the trenches, but the fact that he  was there, and that it was Smolenski who was giving the orders, was  enough.  Few had ever seen Smolenski, but his name was sufficient; it was  as effective as is Mr. Bowen's name on a Bank of England note.  It gave  one a pleasant feeling to know that he was somewhere within call; you  felt there would be no \"routs\" nor stampedes while he was there.  And so  for two days those seven thousand men lay in the trenches, repulsing  attack after attack of the Turkish troops, suffocated with the heat and  chilled with sudden showers, and swept unceasingly by shells and  bullets--partly because they happened to be good men and brave men, but  largely because they knew that somewhere behind them a stout, bull-necked  soldier was sitting on a camp-stool, watching them through a pair "]]]
