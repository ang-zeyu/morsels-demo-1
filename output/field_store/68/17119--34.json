(F) Map of the 590-acre Natural History Reservation, showing the area  where woodrats were studied.         No. 2. On gently sloping hilltop edge 15 feet from the       outcrop and escarpment, built around a forked walnut sapling       having both trunks approximately five inches in diameter.       The sapling, coming up through the center of the house at a       45 deg. angle, evidently had been bent by the accumulated weight       of the debris at an early stage of its growth, many years       before. Trees were small in this part of the woods, with a       well developed understory thicket of coralberry and sumac.       This house approximately one foot high and six feet wide,       was constructed mainly of sticks and was similar in       composition to No. 1, but appeared considerably older with       all the sticks blackened and rotten. In the autumn of 1948       this house was used by woodrats, but probably only as a       temporary stopping place, because it was already in       disrepair then.         No. 3. At edge of escarpment, 25 feet from No. 2, on a flat       boulder approximately six feet long, three feet wide and one       foot thick. The decaying and much flattened mass of sticks       was mainly on top of the boulder, but also spilled over its       edges. Fresh sign was noted at this house in the autumn of       1948, but the house was already in disrepair then, and       seemingly it was used only as a stopping place.         No. 4. At the hilltop outcrop where an elm had fallen across       it. The decaying log remaining was approximately 12 feet       long and 15 inches thick. This log passed diagonally through       the house, providing its main support. The house was       approximately 39 inches high, its summit extending a little       above the level of the top of the outcrop. The house was       approximately seven feet wide along the outcrop. This house       was somewhat intermediate between the typical dome-shaped       stick piles that the rat builds in open situations and the       formless accumulations of sticks with which some rats living       in deep rock crevices line the entrances. Part of the       accumulation was beneath the limestone boulders and       outcropping slabs. Approximately half of the material used       in the house consisted of sticks and the remainder of pieces       of bark and chips of wood, mostly gathered from the fallen       elm. This house had shrunken noticeably from decay and       settling in the months since it was occupied, in the autumn       of 1948. The house was surrounded by a thicket of fragrant       sumac, dogwood, and hackberry saplings.         No. 5. At edge of a protruding boulder one foot thick at the       hilltop outcrop of the west facing escarpment, and 100 feet       back in the woods from the edge of a corn field, in       undergrowth of dogwood, wild currant, and coralberry. The       house consisted of a pile of rotten twigs, 3 inches deep and       30 inches wide on the upper side of the boulder, and a       lining of similar material at the lower edge of the boulder,       partly blocking the crevice beneath it. The twigs composing       the house were old and rotten. However, a few dry but still       green hackberry leaves were stored in the crevice beneath       the boulder. In a bare space atop the boulder were several       recent woodrat droppings, small and obviously produced by an       immature individual, which, perhaps, had recently settled at       this old house site.         No. 6. In hilltop woods, 30 feet from a corner adjoining a       pasture and a corn field, at the base of an osage orange       tree of one foot DBH, and also over a hollow cottonwood log       one foot in diameter and three feet from the osage orange       tree. Suspended mats of grape and smilax vines, and the       thorny, dead, lower branches of the tree provided additional       shelter. The house was composed of sticks and twigs, mostly       of osage orange, with spines still present; slabs of bark,       wood chips, and dry leaves also made up part of it.       Materials on the exterior of the house appeared old and       weathered, but the house was conical and solid. Seven fresh       corn cobs were on the house or near its base, suggesting       that corn from the nearby field had figured importantly in       the diet of the occupant. A well beaten path led from the       base of the house alongside the log, to a large cottonwood       tree 15 feet from the house. This evidence that the house       was occupied was verified by live-trapping the occupant.       Late in 1948, also, the house was occupied by another       individual, but seemingly was deserted for a period of       months thereafter.         No. 7. On upper part of north slope where a hickory seven       inches in diameter had fallen across an old sunken log       approximately one foot in diameter. The house, composed       mainly of hickory twigs 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch in diameter,       mixed with bark, wood chips, and leaves, was partly decayed,       with no fresh sign and was in a thicket of greenbrier,       saplings of hickory and hackberry, and cut tops of       hickories. The top was flattened to less than four inches       above the level of the supporting hickory log. There were       large cavities in the side of the house. When first       discovered in the autumn of 1948, this house was occupied by       a subadult female rat, but she moved away permanently, and       the house had been deserted for approximately a year when       these observations were recorded.         No. 8. In middle of northwest slope, in thick branches of       broken top of a black oak. This house had become flattened       by decay and settling to form a mound approximately one foot       high and five feet in diameter. Only the top protruded       through the carpet of dry leaves. Once well protected and       partly concealed by the branches and twigs of the oak top,       this house was now fully exposed by the disintegration of       the top. The house consisted chiefly of oak twigs. In       October, 1948, a woodrat was live-trapped at this house, but       probably it was a wanderer. The house had then already       undergone much deterioration.      _Natural Enemies_    Some 56 species of animals that regularly prey on small vertebrates live  on the Reservation. Many of the larger kinds may take woodrats  occasionally. Because of size, habitat preferences and the time and  manner of hunting, five species stand out as the more formidable  enemies--the horned owl (_Bubo virginianus_), prairie spotted skunk  (_Spilogale putorius_), long-tailed weasel (_Mustela frenata_), pilot  black snake (_Elaphe obsoleta_) and timber rattlesnake (_Crotalus  horridus_).    Throughout the study horned owls were common on the area, but their  numbers were highest in 1948. Samples of pellet collections have shown  that the cottontail is the staple food, being represented in almost  every pellet. Various rodents also are important in the diet, the cotton  rat, prairie vole, or white-footed mouse being most prominent according  to the time and place of collection. The woodrat is approximately  optimum size for prey, and it constitutes one of the most preferred food  sources. Remains of only two woodrats were found in the pellets  examined, but at times when the pellets were collected woodrats were so  scarce that they constituted only an insignificant percentage of the  biomass of potential prey. On several occasions woodrats in live-traps  were attacked by horned owls, as shown by the overturned and displaced  trap and quantities of fine down adhering to them and to nearby objects.  The horned owl lives in the same habitat as does the woodrat. In other  regions woodrats are known to figure prominently in the diet of the  horned owl. At the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California, for  instance, _N. fuscipes_ was found 240 times, more frequently than any  other kind of prey, in 654 pellets of the horned owl, and this owl was  shown to be the one most important natural enemy of the rat, although  many kinds of carnivores, raptors and snakes also took toll from its  populations. On the Reservation the population of horned owls has been  fairly stable from year to year, with roughly one pair to 100 acres of  woodland. Some territories have been maintained continuously throughout  the eight-year period of observation, though changing to some extent in  size, shape and area included. In 1948, when livestock grazed on the  area, and the ground cover of herbaceous vegetation was relatively  sparse, cottontails were much less abundant than they were later when  the vegetation was protected. Small rodents including voles, cottonrats,  and deer mice, were also less abundant then, and the numerous horned  owls may have been supported in part by the high population of woodrats.    The spotted skunk may be an even more important enemy of the woodrat,  although the evidence is circumstantial. No records of these skunks  preying on woodrats have been found in the literature, nor were any such  instances recorded by us except for attacks on woodrats confined in  live-traps. This skunk is a formidable enemy of small and medium-sized  rodents, as it can climb, dig, and squeeze through small openings. That  it may prey on rat-sized rodents and may even be a limiting factor to  their occurrence is well shown by Crabb's (1941:353) studies in Iowa. He  found that Norway rats (_Rattus norvegicus_)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33574"],[0,"A Field Study of the Kansas Ant-Eating Frog, Gastrophryne olivacea (#3)"],[1,"five  weeks.    Reactions of these same two individuals to low temperatures were tested  in the laboratory. At a body temperature of 11 deg. C. they were  extremely sluggish. They were capable of slow, waddling movements, but  were reluctant to move and tended to crouch motionless. Even when they  were prodded, they usually did not move away, but merely flinched  slightly. At 6 deg. C. they were even more sluggish, and seemed  incapable of locomotion, as they could not be induced to hop or walk by  prodding with a fine wire. When placed upside down on a flat surface,  they could turn over, but did so slowly, sometimes only after a minute  or more had elapsed. Respiratory throat movements numbered 46 and 60 per  minute.      BREEDING    Many observers have noted that breeding activity is initiated by heavy  rains in summer. In my experience precipitation of at least two inches  within a few days is necessary to bring forth large breeding choruses.  With smaller amounts of precipitation only stragglers or small  aggregations are present at the breeding ponds. Tanner (1950: 48) stated  that in three years of observation, near Lawrence, Kansas, the first  storms to bring large numbers of males to the breeding ponds occurred on  June 20, 1947, June 18, 1948, and May 1, 1949.    In 1954 the frogs were recorded first on April 25, but these were under  massive boulders, and were still semi-torpid. Frogs were found fully  active, in numbers, under small flat rocks on May 7. They were found  frequently thereafter. On the afternoon of May 13, the third consecutive  day with temperature slightly above 21 deg. C., low croaking of a frog  was heard among rocks at an old abandoned quarry. Throughout the  remainder of May, calling was heard frequently at the quarry on warm,  sunny afternoons. Often several were calling within an area of a few  square yards, answering each other and maintaining a regular sequence.  In the last week of May rains were frequent, and the precipitation  totalled 2.09 inches. On June 1 and 2 also, there were heavy rains  totalling 2.26 inches. On the evening of June 2 many frogs were calling  at a pond 1/2 mile south of the Reservation, and one was heard at the  pond on the Reservation. By the evening of June 4, dozens were calling  in shallow water along the edge of this pond in dense _Polygonum_ and  other weeds. There was sporadic calling even in daylight and there was a  great chorus each evening for the next few days, but its volume rapidly  diminished.    In mid-June a system of drift fences and funnel traps was installed 200  yards west of the pond in the dry bottom of an old diversion ditch  leading from the pond. The ditch constituted the boundary between  bottomland pasture and a wooded slope, and therefore was a natural  travelway. The object of the installation was to intercept and catch  small animals travelling along the ditch bottom. The drift fence was  W-shaped, with a funnel trap at the apex of each cone so that the  animals travelling in either direction would be caught. The numbers of  frogs caught from time to time during the summer provided information as  to their responses to weather in migrating to the pond.    TABLE 1. NUMBERS OF FROGS CAUGHT WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER RAIN IN FUNNEL  TRAPS IN 1954, FROM MID-JUNE, TO THE TIME OF FIRST FROST.

Capture of an equal number moving away from the pond a few days  afterward might have been expected but none at all was caught while  making a return trip. Therefore it seems that the frogs returned by a  different route to their home ranges after breeding. Of necessity they  make the return trip under conditions drier than those that prevail on  the pondward trip, which is usually made in a downpour. Probably the  return travel is slower, more leisurely, and with more tendency to keep  to sheltered situations.    The call is a bleat, resembling that of a sheep, but higher, of lesser  volume, and is not unlike the loud rattling buzz of an angry bee. The  call is usually of three to four seconds duration, with an interval  several times as long. Calling males were floating, almost upright, in  the water within a few yards of shore, where there was dense vegetation.  The throat pouch when fully expanded is several times as large as the  entire head. When a person approached to within a few yards of frogs  they usually stopped calling, submerged, and swam to a place of  concealment.    Having heard the call of typical _G. carolinensis_ in Louisiana, I have  the impression that it is a little shorter, more sheeplike, and less  insectlike than that of _G. olivacea_. The call of _Gastrophryne_ is of  such peculiar quality that it is difficult to describe. Different  observers have described it in different terms. Stebbins (1951: 391) has  described the call in greatest detail, and also has quoted from the  descriptions of it previously published. These descriptions include the  following: \"high, shrill buzz\"; \"buzz, harsh and metallic\"; \"like an  electric buzzer\"; \"like bees at close range but more like sheep at a  distance\"; \"bleating baa\"; \"shrill, long-drawn quaw quaw\"; \"whistled  wh[=e][=e] followed by a bleat.\"    Stebbins observed breeding choruses (_mazatlanensis_) at Pe[~n]a Blanca  Springs, Arizona, and stated that sometimes three or four called more or  less together, but that they seldom started simultaneously. Occasionally  many voices would be heard in unison followed by an interval of silence,  but this performance was erratic. At the pond on the Reservation I noted  this same tendency many times. After a lull the chorus would begin with  a few sporadic croaks, then four or five or even more frogs would be  calling simultaneously from an area of a few square yards. Anderson  (_op. cit._: 34) found that in small groups of calling _G. carolinensis_  there was a distinct tendency to maintain a definite pattern in the  sequence of the calls. One \"dominant\" individual would initiate a series  of calls, and others each in turn would take up the chorus.    Pairing takes place soon after the breeding aggregations are formed. On  the night of June 4, 1954, a clasping pair was captured and kept in the  laboratory in a large jar of water. This pair did not separate, and  spawning occurred between noon and 1:30 P. M. on June 5. When the newly  laid eggs were discovered at 1:30 P. M. most of them were in a surface  film. Some were attached to submerged leaves and a few rested on the  bottom. The pair was still joined, but the male was actually clasping  only part of the time, and as the frogs moved about in the water, it  became evident that they were adhering to each other by the areas of  skin contact, which were glued together by their dermal secretion. They  were unable to separate immediately, even when they struggled to do so.  They were observed for approximately 15 minutes before separation  occurred, and during this time they were moving about actively. As they  separated, the area of adhesion was discernible on the back of the  female. It was U-shaped, following the ridges of the ilia and the  sacrum.    On August 2, 1954, after a rain of 3.22 inches, the previously mentioned  funnel trap in the ditch had caught 31 ant-eating frogs. Water had  collected to a depth of several inches in the depression where the trap  was situated. A dozen of the trapped frogs were clasping pairs. These  frogs struggled vigorously as they were removed from the traps, handled  and marked. As a result most of the clasping males were separated from  the females. In handling those of each pair I noticed that they were  glued together by dermal secretions, as were those of the pair observed  on June 5. The areas of adhesion were of similar shape and location in  the different pairs, and included the U-shaped ridge of the female's  back and the male's belly, and the inner surfaces of the male's forelegs  with the corresponding surfaces of the female's sides where the male  clasped.    This adhesion of the members of a pair during mating may be a normal  occurrence. The copious secretion of the dermal glands is of especially  glutinous quality in _Gastrophryne_. The adhesion of members of a pair  may have survival value. These small frogs are especially shy, and in  the breeding ponds they respond to any disturbance with vigorous  attempts to escape and hide. Under such circumstances the adhesion may  prevent separation. Also, it may serve to prevent displacement of a  clasping male by a rival. Anderson (_op. cit._) who observed many  details of the mating behavior of _G. carolinensis_, both in the  laboratory and under natural conditions, mentioned no such adhesion  between members of a pair.    Anderson (_op. cit._: 31) discussed the possibility that reproductive  isolation might arise in sympatric populations, such as those of _G.  carolinensis_ in southern Louisiana, through inherent differences in  time of spawning. However, in _G. olivacea_ at least, such isolation  would be prevented by individual males returning to breed at different  times in the same season. "]]]
