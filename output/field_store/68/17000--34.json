It is generally assumed that the  sexual life first awakens at the on-coming of puberty (the attainment of  sexual maturity of manhood or womanhood); the on-coming of puberty is  regarded as the termination of childhood; in fact the term _child_ is  usually defined as the human being from the time of birth to the  on-coming of puberty. But this contradiction is apparent merely, and  depends on the assumption that the on-coming of puberty is indicated by  certain outward signs (more especially the first menstruation and the  first seminal emission), insufficient attention being paid to the long  period of development which usually precedes these occurrences. And yet,  during this period of preliminary development, the occurrence of certain  manifestations of the sexual life is plainly demonstrable.    The period of childhood is subdivided into several sub-epochs, but the  delimitation and nomenclature of these varies so much with different  investigators, that to avoid misunderstanding I must first define the  subdivisions which I myself propose to employ. If we regard the  beginning of the fifteenth year as the termination of childhood, we may  divide childhood into two equal periods, the first extending from birth  to the completion of the seventh year, the second from the beginning of  the eighth to the end of the fourteenth year. I shall in this work  designate these two periods as the _first_ and the _second period of  childhood_ respectively. In the first period of childhood, the first  year of life may be further distinguished as the _period of infancy_.[1]  The first and second periods of childhood comprise childhood in the  narrower sense of the term. The years that immediately follow the  beginning of the fifteenth year I shall denote as the _period of youth_.  Inasmuch as the symptoms of this latter come to differ from those of  childhood proper, not abruptly, but gradually, the first years, at  least, of youth will often come under our consideration, and I shall  speak of this period of life as the _third period of childhood_.  Although childhood in the narrower sense comprises the first and second  periods only, childhood in the wider sense includes also the third  period. It is hardly possible that any misunderstanding can arise if the  reader will bear in mind that whenever I speak of childhood without  qualification, I allude only to the period of life before the beginning  of the fifteenth year. For all these periods of childhood, first,  second, and third, I shall for practical convenience when speaking of  males use the word _boy_, and when speaking of females, the word _girl_.    The use of this terminology must not be regarded as implying that the  distinctions indicated correspond in any way to fixed natural lines of  demarcation; on the contrary, individual variations are numerous and  manifold. Not only does the rate of development differ in different  races (in the Caucasian race, more especially, the age of puberty comes  comparatively late, so that among the members of this race childhood is  prolonged); but further, within the limits of one and the same race,  notable differences occur. More than all have we to take into account  the differences between the sexes, childhood terminating earlier in the  female sex than in the male--among our own people [the Germans] this  difference is commonly estimated at as much as two years. In addition,  in this respect, there are marked differences between different classes  of the population, a matter to which we shall return in Chapter VI.    It is also necessary to point out here in what sense I employ the term  _puberty_ (nubility, sexual ripeness, or maturity), and the associated  terms, _nubile_ and _sexually mature_. Much confusion exists in respect  of the application of these terms. Some use _puberty_ to denote a period  of time, others, a point of time, and in various other ways the word is  differently used by different authors. Similarly as regards the term  _nubile_; some consider an individual to be nubile as soon as he or she  is competent for procreation, others speak of anyone as nubile only when  the development of the sexual life is completed. Obviously, these two  notions are very different; for instance, a girl of thirteen who has  begun to menstruate may be competent for the act of procreation, and yet  her sexual development may still be far from complete. The confusion as  regards the use of the substantive _puberty_ is no less perplexing. One  writer uses it to denote the time at which procreative capacity begins,  and believes he is right in assuming that in the male this time is  indicated by the occurrence of the first involuntary sexual orgasm.[2] I  may point out in passing that there is a confusion here between  procreative capacity and competence for sexual intercourse, for as a  rule the first seminal emissions contain no spermatozoa. But, apart from  such confusions, the term puberty is used in various senses. Thus, a  second writer denotes by puberty the point of time at which the sexual  development is completed; a third means by puberty the period which  elapses between the occurrence of the first involuntary orgasm and the  completion of sexual development; a fourth uses the word to denote the  entire period of life during which procreative capacity endures; and  finally, a fifth includes under the notion of puberty the whole course  of life after the completion of sexual development. In this work I shall  mean by _puberty_ the period of life between the completion of sexual  development and the extinction of the sexual life. The period during  which the state of puberty is being attained will be spoken of as the  _period of puberal development_, and I shall therefore speak of the  _beginning_ and the _end_ of the puberal development. The terms  _nubility_, _sexual maturity_, _nubile_, and _sexually mature_, will be  used with a similar signification. As regards the puberal development,  let me at the outset draw attention to the fact that it takes place very  gradually; and further, as we shall see, that it begins much earlier  than is commonly believed. In the young girl, from the date of the first  menstruation to the time at which she has become fitted for marriage,  the average lapse of time is assumed by Ribbing[3] to be two years. This  is a fair estimate, but it does not correspond to the totality of the  period of the puberal development. If we estimate that period from its  true beginning its duration greatly exceeds two years, for the first  indications of the puberal development are manifest in the girl long  before the first menstruation, and in the boy long before the first  discharge of semen. The approach of puberty is indicated by numerous  symptoms, some of which are psychical and some physical in character. In  perfectly healthy children, as will be shown in the sequel, individual  symptoms may make their appearance as early as the age of seven or  eight, and further symptoms successively appear during succeeding years,  until the puberal development is completed.    What methods are available for the study of the sexual life of the  child? Three methods have to be considered: first, the observation of  children; secondly, experiment; and thirdly, reports made by individuals  regarding their own experiences. As regards the last mentioned, we must  distinguish clearly between accounts reproduced from memory long after  the incidents to which they relate, and accounts given by children of  their state at the time of narration. But both varieties of clinical  history are defective. The child is often incompetent to describe his  sensations--think, for instance, of the processes of the earliest years  of life. Even when the child is able to make reports, a sense of shame  will often interfere with the truthfulness of his account. Whilst as  regards the memory-pictures of adults, recourse to this method often  fails us because the experiences are so remote as to have been largely,  if not entirely, forgotten. The autobiographies of sexually perverse  individuals have drawn my attention to the fallacious nature of memory.  Its records are uncertain, but that especially is recorded which has  aroused interest. Not only the interest felt in the experiences at the  time determines what shall be recorded, but also the interest felt later  when reviving these experiences in memory. Childish experiences are very  readily forgotten, either if they were uninteresting at the time, or if  subsequently they have become uninteresting. During childhood, a  homosexual woman has experienced sexual feeling, directed now towards  boys, now towards girls. Later in life, when the homosexuality has  developed fully, the memory of the inclination towards boys fades away,  and her homosexual sentiments only are remembered. As a result, we often  find that the homosexual woman--and the converse is equally true of the  homosexual man--declares at first, when inquiries are made, that she has  never experienced any inclination for members of the other sex; whereas,  at any rate in a large proportion of cases, a stricter examination of  her memory, or the reports of other individuals, will reveal beyond  dispute that in childhood heterosexual inclinations were not lacking.

He devoted the greater part of  his life to meditating on this theory, and adduced several weighty  reasons in its support. Copernicus could not help perceiving the  complications and entanglements by which the Ptolemaic system of the  universe was surrounded, and which compared unfavourably with the simple  and orderly manner in which other natural phenomena presented themselves  to his observation. By perceiving that Mars when in opposition was not  much inferior in lustre to Jupiter, and when in conjunction resembled a  star of the second magnitude, he arrived at the conclusion that the  Earth could not be the centre of the planet's motion. Having discovered  in some ancient manuscripts a theory, ascribed to the Egyptians, that  Mercury and Venus revolved round the Sun, whilst they accompanied the  orb in his revolution round the Earth, Copernicus was able to perceive  that this afforded him a means of explaining the alternate appearance of  those planets on each side of the Sun. The varied aspects of the  superior planets, when observed in different parts of their orbits, also  led him to conclude that the Earth was not the central body round which  they accomplished their revolutions. As a combined result of his  observation and reasoning Copernicus propounded the theory that the Sun  is the centre of our system, and that all the planets, including the  Earth, revolve in orbits around him. This, which is called the  Copernican system, is now regarded as, and has been proved to be, the  true theory of the solar system.    TYCHO BRAHE was a celebrated Danish astronomer, who earned a deservedly  high reputation on account of the number and accuracy of his  astronomical observations and calculations. The various astronomical  tables that were in use in his time contained many inaccuracies, and it  became necessary that they should be reconstructed upon a more correct  basis. Tycho possessed the practical skill required for this kind of  work.    He was born December 14, 1546, at Knudstorp, near Helsingborg. His  father, Otto Brahe, traced his descent from a Swedish family of noble  birth. At the age of thirteen Tycho was sent to the University of  Copenhagen, where it was intended he should prepare himself for the  study of the law.    The prediction of a great solar eclipse, which was to happen on August  21, 1560, caused much public excitement in Denmark, for in those days  such phenomena were regarded as portending the occurrence of events of  national importance. Tycho looked forward with great eagerness to the  time of the eclipse. He watched its progress with intense interest, and  when he perceived all the details of the phenomenon occur exactly as  they were predicted, he resolved to pursue the study of a science by  which, as was then believed, the occurrence of future events could be  foretold. From Copenhagen Tycho Brahe was sent to Leipsic to study  jurisprudence, but astronomy absorbed all his thoughts. He spent his  pocket-money in purchasing astronomical books, and, when his tutor had  retired to sleep, he occupied his time night after night in watching the  stars and making himself familiar with their courses. He followed the  planets in their direct and retrograde movements, and with the aid of a  small globe and pair of compasses was able by means of his own  calculations to detect serious discrepancies in the Alphonsine and  Prutenic tables. In order to make himself more proficient in calculating  astronomical tables he studied arithmetic and geometry, and learned  mathematics without the aid of a master. Having remained at Leipsic for  three years, during which time he paid far more attention to the study  of astronomy than to that of law, he returned to his native country in  consequence of the death of an uncle, who bequeathed him a considerable  estate. In Denmark he continued to prosecute his astronomical studies,  and incurred the displeasure of his friends, who blamed him for  neglecting his intended profession and wasting his time on astronomy,  which they regarded as useless and unprofitable.    Not caring to remain among his relatives, Tycho Brahe returned to  Germany, and arrived at Wittenberg in 1566. Whilst residing here he had  an altercation with a Danish gentleman over some question in  mathematics. The quarrel led to a duel with swords, which terminated  rather unfortunately for Tycho, who had a portion of his nose cut off.  This loss he repaired by ingeniously contriving one of gold, silver, and  wax, which was said to bear a good resemblance to the original. From  Wittenberg Tycho proceeded to Augsburg, where he resided for two years.  Here he made the acquaintance of several men distinguished for their  learning and their love of astronomy. During his stay at Augsburg he  constructed a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius, on which were  indicated the single minutes of a degree; he made many valuable  observations with this instrument, which he used in combination with a  large sextant.    In 1571 Tycho returned to Denmark, where his fame as an astronomer had  preceded him, and was the means of procuring for him a hearty welcome  from his relatives and friends. In 1572, when returning one night from  his laboratory--for Tycho studied alchemy as well as astronomy--he  beheld what appeared to be a new and brilliant star in the  constellation Cassiopeia, which was situated overhead. He directed the  attention of his companions to this wonderful object, and all declared  that they had never observed such a star before. On the following night  he measured its distance from the nearest stars in the constellation,  and arrived at the conclusion that it was a fixed star, and beyond our  system.    This remarkable object remained visible for sixteen months, and when at  its brightest rivalled Sirius. At first it was of a brilliant white  colour, but as it diminished in size it became yellow; it next changed  to a red colour, resembling Aldebaran; afterwards it appeared like  Saturn, and as it grew smaller it decreased in brightness, until it  finally became invisible. In 1573 Tycho Brahe married a peasant-girl  from the village of Knudstorp. This imprudent act roused the resentment  of his relatives, who, being of noble birth, were indignant that he  should have contracted such an alliance. The bitterness and mutual  ill-feeling created by this affair became so intense that the King of  Denmark deemed it advisable to endeavour to bring about a  reconciliation.    After this Tycho returned to Germany, and visited several cities before  deciding where he should take up his permanent residence.    His fame as an astronomer was now so great that he was received with  distinction wherever he went, and on the occasion of a visit to  Hesse-Cassel he spent a few pleasant days with William, Landgrave of  Hesse, who was himself skilled in astronomy.    Frederick II., King of Denmark, having recognised Tycho Brahe's great  merits as an astronomer, and not wishing that his fame should add lustre  to a foreign Court, expressed a desire that he should return to his  native country, and as an inducement offered him a life interest in the  island of Huen, in the Sound, where he undertook to erect and equip an  observatory at his own expense; the King also promised to bestow upon  him a pension, and grant him other emoluments besides.    Tycho gladly accepted this generous offer, and during the construction  of the observatory occupied his time in making a magnificent collection  of instruments and appliances adapted for observational purposes. This  handsome edifice, upon which the King of Denmark expended a sum of  20,000_l._, was called 'Uranienburg' ('The Citadel of the Heavens').  Here Tycho resided for a period of twenty years, during which time he  pursued his astronomical labours with untiring energy and zeal, and made  a large number of observations and calculations of much superior  accuracy to any that existed previously, which were afterwards of great  service to his successors. During his long residence at Huen, Tycho was  visited by many distinguished persons, who were attracted to his island  home by his fame and the magnificence of his observatory. Among them was  James VI. of Scotland, who, whilst journeying to the Court of Denmark  on the occasion of his marriage to a Danish princess, paid Tycho a  visit, and enjoyed his hospitality for a week. The King was delighted  with all that he saw, and on his departure presented Tycho with a  handsome donation, and at his request composed some Latin verses, in  which he eulogised his host and praised his observatory.    The island of Huen is situated about six miles from the coast of  Zealand, and fourteen from Copenhagen. It has a circumference of six  miles, and consists chiefly of an elevated plateau, in the centre of  which Tycho erected his observatory, the site of which is now marked by  two pits and a few mounds of earth--all that remains of Uranienburg. All  went well with Tycho Brahe during the lifetime of his noble patron; but  in 1588 Frederick II. died, and was succeeded by his son, a youth eleven  years of age.    The Danish nobles had long been jealous of Tycho's fame and reputation,  and on the death of the King an opportunity was afforded them of  intriguing with the object of accomplishing his downfall. Several false  accusations were brought against him, and the Court party made the  impoverished state of the Treasury an excuse for depriving him of his  pension and emoluments granted by the late King.    Tycho was no longer able to bear the expense of maintaining his  establishment at Huen, and fearing that he might be deprived of the  island itself, he took a house in Copenhagen, to which he removed all  his smaller instruments.    During his residence in the capital he was subjected to annoyance and  persecution. An order was issued in the King's name"]]]
