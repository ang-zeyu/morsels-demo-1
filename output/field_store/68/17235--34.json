He looked around for her,  recognizing from the sound that she must be in distress. His eye fell  on Lad, crouching tense and eager in front of the shut study door.    The Master opened the door and went into the study.    At the first step inside the room he stopped, aghast. There lay the  chewed and battered fragments of his beloved eagle. And there, in one  corner, frightened, with guilt writ plain all over her, cowered  Lady. Men have been \"legally\" done to death on far lighter evidence  than encompassed her.    The Master was thunderstruck. For more than two years Lady had had the  free run of the house. And this was her first sin--at that, a sin  unworthy any well-bred dog that has graduated from puppyhood and from  milk-teeth. He would not have believed it. He _could_ not have  believed it. Yet here was the hideous evidence, scattered all over the  floor.    The door was shut, but the window stood wide. Through the window,  doubtless, she had gotten into the room. And he had surprised her at  her vandal-work before she could escape by the same opening.    The Master was a just man--as humans go; but this was a crime the most  maudlin dog-spoiler could not have condoned. The eagle, moreover, had  been the pride of his heart--as perhaps I have said. Without a word,  he walked to the wall and took down a braided dog-whip, dust-covered  from long disuse.    Lady knew what was coming. Being a thoroughbred, she did not try to  run, nor did she roll for mercy. She cowered, moveless, nose to floor,  awaiting her doom.    Back swished the lash. Down it came, whistling as a man whistles whose  teeth are broken. Across Lady's slender flanks it smote, with the full  force of a strong driving-arm. Lady quivered all over. But she made  no sound. She who would whimper at a chance touch to her sore foot,  was mute under human punishment.    But Lad was not mute. As the Master's arm swung back for a second  blow, he heard, just behind, a low, throaty growl that held all the  menace of ten thousand wordy threats.    He wheeled about. Lad was close at his heels, fangs bared, eyes red,  head lowered, tawny body taut in every sinew.    The Master blinked at him, incredulous. Here was something infinitely  more unbelievable than Lady's supposed destruction of the eagle. The  Impossible had come to pass.    For, know well, a dog does not growl at its Master. At its owner,  perhaps; at its Master, never. As soon would a devout priest blaspheme  his deity.    Nor does a dog approach anything or anybody, growling and with lowered  head, unless intent on battle. Have no fear when a dog barks or even  growls at you, so long as his head is erect. But when he growls and  lowers his head--then look out. It means but one thing.    The Master had been the Master--the sublime, blindly revered and  worshiped Master--for all the blameless years of Lad's life. And now,  growling, head down, the dog was threatening him.    It was the supreme misery, the crowning hell, of Lad's career. For the  first time, two overpowering loves fought with each other in his  Galahad soul. And the love for poor, unjustly blamed, Lady hurled down  the superlove for the Master.    In baring teeth upon his lord, the collie well knew what he was  incurring. But he did not flinch. Understanding that swift death  might well be his portion, he stood his ground.    (Is there greater love? Humans--sighing swains, vow-laden suitors--can  any of _you_ match it? I think not. Not even the much-lauded  Antonys. They throw away only the mere world of earthly credit, for  love.)    The Master's jaw set. He was well-nigh as unhappy as the dog. For he  grasped the situation, and he was man enough to honor Lad's proffered  sacrifice. Yet it must be punished, and punished instantly--as any  dog-master will testify. Let a dog once growl or show his teeth in  menace at his Master, and if the rebellion be not put down in drastic  fashion, the Master ceases forever to be Master and degenerates to  mere owner. His mysterious power over his dog is gone for all time.    Turning his back on Lady, the Master whirled his dog-whip in air. Lad  saw the lash coming down. He did not flinch. He did not cower. The  growl ceased. The orange-tawny collie stood erect. Down came the  braided whiplash on Lad's shoulders--again over his loins, and yet  again and again.    Without moving--head up, dark tender eyes unwinking--the hero-dog took  the scourging. When it was over, he waited only to see the Master  throw the dog-whip fiercely into a corner of the study. Then, knowing  Lady was safe, Lad walked majestically back to his \"cave\" under the  piano, and with a long, quivering sigh he lay down.    His spirit was sick and crushed within him. For the first time in his  thoroughbred life he had been struck. For he was one of those not  wholly rare dogs to whom a sharp word of reproof is more effective  than a beating--to whom a blow is not a pain, but a damning and  overwhelming ignominy. Had a human, other than the Master, presumed  to strike him, the assailant must have fought for life.    Through the numbness of Lad's grief, bit by bit, began to smolder and  glow a deathless hate for Knave, the cause of Lady's humiliation. Lad  had known what passed behind that closed study door as well as though  he had seen. For ears and scent serve a true collie quite as usefully  as do mere eyes.    The Master was little happier than was his favorite dog. For he loved  Lad as he would have loved a human son. Though Lad did not realize it,  the Master had \"let off\" Lady from the rest of her beating, in order  not to increase her champion's grief. He simply ordered her out of the  study.    And as she limped away, the Master tried to rekindle his own  indignation and deaden his sense of remorse by gathering together the  strewn fragments of the eagle. It occurred to him that though the bird  was destroyed, he might yet have its fierce-eyed silvery head mounted  on a board, as a minor trophy.    But he could not find the head.    Search the study as he would, he could not find it. He remembered  distinctly that Lady had been panting as she slunk out of the  room. And dogs that are carrying things in their mouths cannot pant.  She had not taken the head away with her. The absence of the head only  deepened the whole annoying domestic mystery. He gave up trying to  solve any of the puzzle--from Lady's incredible vandalism to this  newest turn of the affair.    Not until two days later could Lad bring himself to risk a meeting  with Lady, the cause and the witness of his beating. Then, yearning  for a sight of her and for even her grudged recognition of his  presence, after his forty-eight hours of isolation, he sallied forth  from the house in search of her.    He traced her to the cool shade of a lilac clump near the outbuildings.  There, having with one paw dug a little pit in the cool earth,  she was curled up asleep under the bushes. Stretched out beside  her was Knave.    Lad's spine bristled at sight of his foe. But ignoring him, he moved  over to Lady and touched her nose with his own in timid caress. She  opened one eye, blinked drowsily and went to sleep again.    But Lad's coming had awakened Knave. Much refreshed by his nap, he  woke in playful mood. He tried to induce Lady to romp with him, but  she preferred to doze. So, casting about in his shallow mind for  something to play with, Knave chanced to remember the prize he had  hidden beneath the chicken-house.    Away he ambled, returning presently with the eagle's head between his  teeth. As he ran, he tossed it aloft, catching it as it fell--a pretty  trick he had long since learned with a tennis-ball.    Lad, who had lain down as near to sleepily scornful Lady as he dared,  looked up and saw him approach. He saw, too, with what Knave was  playing; and as he saw, he went quite mad. Here was the thing that had  caused Lady's interrupted punishment and his own black disgrace. Knave  was exploiting it with manifest and brazen delight.    For the second time in his life--and for the second time in three  days--Lad broke the law. He forgot, in a trice, the command \"Let him  alone!\" And noiseless, terrible, he flew at the gamboling Knave.    Knave was aware of the attack, barely in time to drop the eagle's head  and spring forward to meet his antagonist. He was three years Lad's  junior and was perhaps five pounds heavier. Moreover, constant  exercise had kept him in steel-and-whale-bone condition; while lonely  brooding at home had begun of late to soften Lad's tough sinews.    Knave was mildly surprised that the dog he had looked on as a dullard  and a poltroon should have developed a flash of spirit. But he was not  at all unwilling to wage a combat whose victory must make him shine  with redoubled glory in Lady's eyes.    Like two furry whirlwinds the collies spun forward toward each  other. They met, upreared and snarled, slashing wolf-like for the  throat, clawing madly to retain balance. Then down they went, rolling  in a right unloving embrace, snapping, tearing, growling.    Lad drove straight for the throat. A half-handful of Knave's golden  ruff came away in his jaws. For except at the exact center, a  collie's throat is protected by a tangle of hair as effective against  assault as were Andrew Jackson's cotton-bale breastworks at New  Orleans. And Lad had missed the exact center.    Over and over they rolled. They regained their footing and reared  again. Lad's saber-shaped tusk ripped a furrow in Knave's satiny  forehead; and Knave's half deflected slash in return set bleeding the  big vein at the top of Lad's left ear.    Lady was wide awake long before this. Standing immovable, yet wildly  excited--after the age-old fashion of the female brute for whom males  battle and who knows she is to be the winner's prize--she watched  every turn of the fight.

When this canal was cut, no one  knows.... Where it flows into the Shat-el-Arab it is about a quarter  of a mile in width, with a depth of from twenty to thirty feet.    \"The town of Mohammerah is situated a little more than a mile up the  canal on its right bank, and is a filthy place, with about 2000  inhabitants, and consists mainly of mud huts and hovels, backed by a  superb fringe of date palms.\"[3] In the rose flush of a winter morning  we steamed slowly past this diplomatically famous confluence of the  Haffar and Shat-el-Arab, at the angle of which the Persians have  lately built a quay, a governor's house, and a large warehouse, in  expectation of a trade which shows few signs of development.    A winter morning it was indeed, splendid and invigorating after the  ferocious heat of the Gulf. To-day there has been frost!    The Shat-el-Arab is a noble river or estuary. From both its Persian  and Turkish shores, however, mountains have disappeared, and dark  forests of date palms intersected by canals fringe its margin heavily,  and extend to some distance inland. The tide is strong, and such  native boats as _belems_, _buggalows_, and dug-outs, loaded with  natives and goods, add a cheerful element of busy life.    We anchored near Basrah, below the foreign settlement, and had the  ignominy of being placed for twenty-four hours in quarantine, flying  the degrading yellow flag. Basrah has just been grievously ravaged by  the cholera, which has not only carried off three hundred of the  native population daily for some time, but the British Vice-Consul and  his children. Cholera still exists in Turkey while it is extinct in  Bombay, and the imposition of quarantine on a ship with a \"clean bill  of health\" seems devised for no other purpose than to extract fees, to  annoy, and to produce a harassing impression of Turkish officialism.    After this detention we steamed up to the anchorage, which is in front  of a few large bungalows which lie between the belt of palms and the  river, and form the European settlement of Margil. A fever-haunted  swamp, with no outlet but the river; canals exposing at low water  deep, impassable, and malodorous slime separating the bungalows; a  climate which is damp, hot, malarious, and prostrating except for a  few weeks in winter, and a total absence of all the resources and  amenities of civilisation, make Basrah one of the least desirable  places to which Europeans are exiled by the exigencies of commerce. It  is scarcely necessary to say that the few residents exercise unbounded  hospitality, which is the most grateful memory which the stranger  retains of the brief halt by the \"River of Arabia.\"    This is the dead season in the \"city of dates.\" An unused river  steamer, a large English trader, two Turkish ships-of-war painted  white, the _Mejidieh_, one of two English-owned steamers which are  allowed to ply on the Tigris, and the _Assyria_ of the B.I.S.N. Co.,  constitute the fleet at anchor. As at Bushire, all cargo must be  loaded and unloaded by boats, and crowds of native craft hanging on to  the trading vessels give a little but not much vivacity.    October, after the ingathering of the date harvest, is the busiest  month here. The magnitude of the date industry may be gathered from  the fact that in 1890, 60,000 tons of dates were exported from Basrah,  20,000 in boxes, and the remainder in palm-leaf mats, one vessel  taking 1800 tons. The quantity of wood imported for the boxes was 7000  tons in cut lengths, with iron hooping, nails, and oiled paper for  inside wrapping, brought chiefly from England.    A hundred trees can be grown on an acre of ground. The mature tree  gives a profit of 4s., making the profit on an acre L20 annually. The  Governor of Mohammerah has lately planted 30,000 trees, and date palms  to the number of 60,000 have been recently planted on Persian soil.    It is said that there are 160 varieties of dates, but only a few are  known to commerce. These great sombre date forests or \"date gardens,\"  which no sunshine can enliven, are of course artificial, and depend  upon irrigation. The palms are propagated by means of suckers taken  from the female date. The young trees begin to bear when they are  about five years old, reach maturity at nine, and may be prolific for  two centuries. Mohammed said wisely, \"Honour the palm, it is your  paternal aunt.\" One soon learns here that it not only provides the  people with nutritious food, but with building materials, as well as  with fuel, carpets, ropes, and mats. But it is the least beautiful of  the palms, and the dark monotonous masses along the river contrast  with my memories of the graceful coco palm fringing the coral islands  of the Pacific.    I left the _Assyria_ with regret. The captain and officers had done  all that intelligence and kindness could do to make the voyage an  agreeable one, and were altogether successful. On shore a hospitable  reception, a good fire, and New Year's Day come together  appropriately. The sky is clear and cloudless, and the air keen. The  bungalows belonging to the European firms are dwelling-houses above  and offices below, and are surrounded by packing-yards and sheds for  goods. In line with them are the Consulates.    The ancient commercial glories of Basrah are too well known to need  recapitulation. Circumstances are doing much to give it something of  renewed importance. The modern Basrah, a town which has risen from a  state of decay till it has an estimated population of 25,000, is on  the right bank of the river, at some distance up a picturesque  palm-fringed canal. Founded by Omar soon after the death of Mohammed,  and tossed like a shuttlecock between Turk and Persian, it is now  definitely Turkish, and the great southern outlet of Chaldaea and  Mesopotamia, as well as the port at which the goods passing to and  from Baghdad \"break bulk.\" A population more thoroughly polyglot could  scarcely be found, Turks, Arabs, Sabeans, Syrians, Greeks, Hindus,  Armenians, Frenchmen, Wahabees, Britons, Jews, Persians, Italians, and  Africans, and there are even more creeds than races.    _S.S. Mejidieh, River Tigris, Jan. 4._--Leaving Basrah at 4 P.M. on  Tuesday we have been stemming the strong flood of the Tigris for three  bright winter days, in which to sit by a red-hot stove and sleep under  a pile of blankets have been real luxuries after the torrid heat of  the \"Gulf.\" The party on board consists of Dr. Bruce, Mr. Hammond, who  has been for some months pushing British trade at Shuster, the  Assistant Quartermaster-General for India, a French-speaking Jewish  merchant, the Hon. G. Curzon, M.P., and Mr. Swabadi, a Hungarian  gentleman in the employment of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam  Navigation Company, a very scholarly man, who in the course of a long  residence in Southern Turkey has acquainted himself intimately with  the country and its peoples, and is ever ready to place his own stores  of information at our disposal. Mr. Curzon has been \"prospecting\" the  Karun river, and came on board from the _Shushan_, a small stern-wheel  steamer with a carrying capacity of 30 tons, a draught when empty of  18 inches, and when laden of from 24 to 36. She belongs to the Messrs.  Lynch Brothers, of the Tigris and Euphrates S.N. Co. They run her once  a fortnight at a considerable loss between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Her  isolated position and diminutive size are a curious commentary on the  flourish of trumpets and _blether_ of exultation with which the  English newspapers announced the very poor concession of leave to run  steamers on the Karun between the Shat-el-Arab and Ahwaz.    [Since this letter was written, things have taken rather a singular  turn, and the development of trade on the Karun has partly fallen into  the hands of a trading corporation of Persians, the _Nasiri_ Company.  By them, and under their representative partner, Haja Mahomad, a man  of great energy, the formidable rapids at Ahwaz are being circumvented  by the construction of a tramway 2400 yards long, which is proceeding  steadily. A merchants' caravanserai has already been built on the  river bank at the lower landing-place and commencement of the tramway,  and a bakery, butchery, and carpentry, along with a _cafe_ and a  grocery and general goods stores, have already been opened by men  brought to Ahwaz by H. Mahomad.    A river face wall, where native craft are to lie, is being constructed  of hewn stone blocks and sections of circular pillars, remains of the  ancient city.    The _Nasiri_ Company has a small steamer, the _Nasiri_, plying on the  lower Karun, chiefly as a tug, taking up two Arab boats of  twenty-seven tons each, lashed alongside of her. On her transference  at the spring floods of this year to the river above Ahwaz, the  _Karun_, a steam launch of about sixty tons, belonging to the Governor  of Mohammerah, takes her place below, and a second steamer belonging  to the same company is now running on the lower stream. Poles from  Zanzibar have been distributed for a telegraph line from Mohammerah to  Ahwaz. The Messrs. Lynch have placed a fine river steamer of 300 tons  on the route; but this enterprising firm, and English capitalists  generally, are being partially \"cut out\" by the singular \"go\" of this  Persian company, which not only appears to have strong support from  Government quarters, but has gained the co-operation of the  well-known and wealthy Sheikh Mizal, whose personal influence in  Arabistan is very great, and who has hitherto been an obstacle to the  opening of trade on the Karun.    A great change for the better has taken place in the circumstances of  the population, and villages, attracted by trade, are springing up,  which the _Nasiri_ Company is doing its best to encourage.
