The above quotations are from the letter Father Dallion  wrote to one of his friends in France July 18, 1627, he having then  returned to Toanchain, a Huron village. I have followed the text as  given by Sagard. It is significant that Le Clercq, in his \"Premier  Etablissement de la Foy,\" etc., gives a portion of Dallion's account of  his visit to the Neuters, but omits nearly everything he says about  trade.    Father Dallion sojourned three winter months with the Neuters, but the  latter part of the stay was far from agreeable. The Hurons, he says,  having discovered that he talked of leading the Neuters to trade, at  once spread false and evil reports of him. They said he was a great  magician; that he was a poisoner, that he tainted the air of the country  where he tarried, and that if the Neuters did not kill him, he would  burn their villages and kill their children. The priest was at a  disadvantage in not having much command of the Neuter dialect, and it is  not strange, after the evil report had once been started, that he should  have seemed to engage in some devilish incantation whenever he held the  cross before them or sought to baptize the children. When one reflects  upon the dense wall of ignorance and superstition against which his  every effort at moral or spiritual teaching was impotent, the admiration  for the martyr spirit which animated the effort is tempered by amazement  that an acute and sagacious man should have thought it well to \"labor\"  in such an obviously ineffective way. But history is full of instances  of ardent devotion to aims which the \"practical\" man would denounce at  once as unattainable. That Father Dallion was animated by the spirit of  the martyrs is attested in his own account of what befel him. A  treacherous band of ten came to him and tried to pick a quarrel. \"One  knocked me down with a blow of his fist, another took an ax and tried to  split my head. God averted his hand; the blow fell on a post near me. I  also received much other ill-treatment; but that is what we came to seek  in this country.\" His assailants robbed him of many of his possessions,  including his breviary and compass. These precious things, which were no  doubt \"big medicine\" in the eyes of his ungracious hosts, were  afterwards returned. The news of his maltreatment reached the ears of  Fathers Brebeuf and De la Noue at the Huron mission. They sent the  messenger, Grenole, to bring him back, if found alive. Father Dallion  returned with Grenole early in the year 1627; and so ended the first  recorded visit of white man to the Niagara region.           *       *       *       *       *    For fourteen years succeeding, I find no allusion to our district. Then  comes an episode which is so adventurous and so heroic, so endowed with  beauty and devotion, that it should be familiar to all who give any  heed to what has happened in the vicinity of the Niagara.    Jean de Brebeuf was a missionary priest of the Jesuits. That implies  much; but in his case even such a general imputation of exalted  qualities falls short of justice. His is a superb figure, a splendid  acquisition to the line of heroic figures that pass in shadowy  procession along the horizon of our home history. Trace the narrative of  his life as sedulously as we may, examine his character and conduct in  whatever critical light we may choose to study them, and still the noble  figure of Father Brebeuf is seen without a flaw. There were those of his  order whose acts were at times open to two constructions. Some of them  were charged, by men of other faith and hostile allegiance, with using  their priestly privileges as a cloak for worldly objects. No such charge  was ever brought against Father Brebeuf. The guilelessness and heroism  of his life are unassailable.    He was of a noble Normandy family, and when he comes upon the scene, on  the banks of the Niagara, he was forty-seven years old. He had come out  to Quebec fifteen years before and had been assigned to the Huron  mission. In 1628 he was called back to Quebec, but five years later he  was allowed to return to his charge in the remote wilderness. The record  of his work and sufferings there is not a part of our present story.  Those who seek a marvelous exemplification of human endurance and  devotion, may find it in the ancient Relations of the order. He lived  amid threats and plots against his life, he endured what seems  unendurable, and his zeal throve on the experience. In November, 1640,  he and a companion, the priest Joseph Chaumonot, resolved to carry the  cross to the Neuter nation. They no doubt knew of Father Dallion's  dismal experience; and were spurred on thereby. Like him, they sought  martyrdom. Their route from the Huron country to the Niagara has been  traced with skill and probable accuracy by the Very Rev. Wm. R. Harris,  Dean of St. Catharines. At this time the Neuter nation lived to the  north of Lake Erie throughout what we know as the Niagara Peninsula, and  on both sides of the Niagara, their most eastern village being near the  present site of Lockport. From an uncertain boundary, thereabouts, they  confronted the possessions of the Senecas, who a few years later were to  wipe them off the face of the earth and occupy all their territory east  of the lake and river.    Fathers Brebeuf and Chaumonot set out on their hazardous mission  November 2d, in the year named, from a Huron town in the present  township of Medonte, Ontario. (Near Penetanguishene, on Georgian Bay.)  Their probable path was through the present towns of Beeton,  Orangeville, Georgetown, Hamilton and St. Catharines. They came out upon  the Niagara just north of the Queenston escarpment. The journey thus far  had been a succession of hardships. The interpreters whom they had  engaged to act as guides deserted them at the outset. Ahead of them went  the reputation which the Hurons spread abroad, that they were magicians  and carried all manner of evils with them. Father Brebeuf was a man of  extraordinary physical strength. Many a time, in years gone by, he had  astonished the Indians by his endurance at the paddle, and in carrying  great loads over the portages. His companion, Chaumonot, was smaller and  weaker, but was equally sustained by faith in Divine guidance. On their  way through the forests, Father Brebeuf was cheered by a vision of  angels, beckoning him on; but when he and his companion finally stood on  the banks of the Niagara, under the leaden sky of late November, there  was little of the beatific in the prospect. They crossed the swirling  stream--by what means must be left to conjecture, the probability being  in favor of a light bark canoe--and on the eastern bank found themselves  in the hostile village of Onguiara--the first-mentioned settlement on  the banks of our river.    Here the half-famished priests were charged with having come to ruin the  people. They were refused shelter and food, but finally found  opportunity to step into a wigwam, where Indian custom, augmented by  fear, permitted them to remain. The braves gathered around, and proposed  to put them to death. \"I am tired,\" cried one, \"eating the dark flesh of  our enemies, and I want to taste the white flesh of the Frenchman.\" So  at least is the record in the Relation. Another drew bow to pierce the  heart of Chaumonot; but all fell back in awe when the stalwart Brebeuf  stepped forth into their midst, without weapon and without fear, and  raising his hand exclaimed: \"We have not come here for any other purpose  than to do you a friendly service. We wish to teach you to worship the  Master of Life, so that you may be happy in this world and in the  other.\"    Whether or not any of the spiritual import of his speech was  comprehended cannot be said; but the temper of the crowd changed, so  that, instead of threatening immediate death, they began to take a  curious, childish interest in the two \"black-gowns\"; examining the  priests' clothes, and appropriating their hats and other loose articles.  The travelers completely mystified them by reading a written message,  and thus getting at another's thoughts without a spoken word. The  Relation is rich in details of this sort, and of the wretchedness of the  life which the missionaries led. They visited other \"towns,\" as the  collections of bark wigwams are called; but everywhere they were looked  upon as necromancers, and their lives were spared only through fear.    Far into the winter the priests endured all manner of hardship. Food was  sometimes thrown to them as to a worthless dog, sometimes denied  altogether, and then they had to make shift with such roots and barks or  chance game as their poor woodcraft enabled them to procure, or the  meager winter woods afforded. On one occasion, when a chief frankly told  them that his people would have killed them long before, but for fear  that the spirits of the priests would in vengeance destroy them,  Brebeuf began to assure him that his mission was only to do good;  whereupon the savage replied by spitting in the priest's face; and the  priest thanked God that he was worthy of the same indignity which had  been put upon Jesus Christ. When one faces his foes in such a spirit,  there is absolutely nothing to fear. And yet, after four months of these  experiences, there seems not to have been the slightest sign of any good  result. The savages were as invulnerable to any moral or spiritual  teachings as the chill earth itself. Dumb brutes would have shown more  return for kindness than they. The saying of Chateaubriand, that man  without religion is the most dangerous animal that walks the earth,  found full justification in these savages. Finally, Brebeuf and his  associate determined to withdraw from the absolutely fruitless field,  and began to retrace their steps towards Huronia.    It was near"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37009"],[0,"Butterflies Worth Knowing (#3)"],[1,"changes would often be at a loss to  recognize caterpillars of slightly differing sizes as belonging to the  same species. These changes commonly show a remarkable adaptation to  the conditions of life, and generally tend to the concealment of the  caterpillar upon its food plant. The stages of growth of the  green-clouded swallowtail caterpillar are illustrated on plate  opposite page 80.    Before each moult the caterpillar is likely to spin a silken web upon  the leaf surface. It then entangles its claws in the web to hold  itself in place while the skin is cast. (_See plate, page 17._)       _The Change to the Chrysalis_    (_See plate, pages 32-33._)    A week or ten days after the last moult of its caterpillar growth the  larva commonly becomes full fed and ready to change to the chrysalis  state. The details of the way in which this is accomplished vary  greatly with different butterflies, as will be noted in the stories of  many species later in this book. In general, however, the caterpillar  provides a web of silk which it spins against some surface where the  chrysalis will be secure and in this web it entangles its hind legs.  Sometimes there is the additional protection of a loop of silk over  the front end of the body. After the legs have become entangled the  caterpillar hangs downward until the skin splits open along the median  line of the back and gradually shrinks upward until it is almost free,  showing as it comes off a curious creature which has some of the  characteristic features of a chrysalis. It is seldom at this stage of  the same shape as the chrysalis. When the caterpillar's skin is nearly  off this chrysalis-like object usually wriggles its body quickly in a  manner to entangle a curious set of hooks attached to the upper end in  the web of silken thread. This hook-like projection is called the  cremaster, and it serves a very important purpose in holding the  chrysalis in position.       [Illustration: Swallowtail Chrysalis, showing (_b_) the loop of       silk over thorax. (After Riley)]    As soon as the cremaster is entangled in the web the cast skin usually  falls off and for a very short period the creature hanging seems to be  neither caterpillar nor chrysalis. It is in fact in a transition stage  between the two, and it very soon shortens up and takes on the  definite form of the chrysalis, the outer tissues hardening into the  characteristic chrysalis skin.    From the fact that this chrysalis skin shows many of the  characteristic features of the future butterfly it is evident that the  change from the caterpillar to the butterfly really began during the  life of the larva. The nature of the process by which this change  takes place has long been a puzzle to scientists. For the making of a  butterfly is one of the most wonderful phenomena in the outer world,  and it has challenged the attention of many acute observers. Some two  centuries ago the great Dutch naturalist, Swammerdam, studied very  carefully the development of many insects, especially the butterfly.  He found that if he placed in boiling water a caterpillar that was  ready to pupate or become a chrysalis, the outer skin could easily be  removed, revealing beneath the immature butterfly with well-developed  legs and antennae. From these observations he was led to believe that  the process of growth was simply a process of unfolding; that is, as  Professor Packard has expressed it, \"That the form of the larva, pupa,  and imago preexisted in the egg and even in the ovary; and that the  insects in these stages were distinct animals, contained one inside  the other, like a nest of boxes or a series of envelopes one within  the other.\" This was called the incasement theory and it was held to  be correct by naturalists for nearly a century. It was discredited,  however, about a hundred years ago, but not until another fifty years  had passed was it definitely replaced by another and much more  convincing theory propounded by Weismann.    According to Weismann's theory, which is now well-established, the  process of development internally is a much more continuous one than  the external changes would indicate. So far as the latter are  concerned we simply say that a caterpillar changes to a chrysalis and  a chrysalis to a butterfly, the transition in each case requiring but  a very short time. Internally, however, it has been going on almost  continuously from the early life of the caterpillar. The various  organs of the butterfly arise from certain germinal disks or  \"imaginal\" buds, the word \"imaginal\" in this case being an adjective  form of imago, so that the imaginal buds are really simply buds for  the starting of growth of the various organs of the imago or adult. As  the caterpillars approach the chrysalis period these imaginal buds  rapidly develop into the various organs of the butterfly. This process  is helped along by the breaking down of many of the tissues of the  larva, this broken-down tissue being then utilized for the production  of the new organs. About the time the chrysalis is formed this  breaking-down process becomes very general, so that the newly formed  chrysalis seems largely a mass of creamy material which is soon used  to build up the various parts of the butterfly through the growth of  the imaginal buds.       _The Change to the Butterfly_    (_See plate, pages 32-33._)    There is probably no phenomenon in the world of living creatures which  has attracted more attention than the change of the chrysalis into the  butterfly. It is not strange that this is so. We see upon a tree or  shrub or wall an inert, apparently lifeless object, having no  definite form with which we can compare it with other things, having  neither eyes nor ears nor wings nor legs--an object apparently of as  little interest as a lifeless piece of rock. A few minutes later we  behold it again and note with astonishment that this apparently  inanimate being has been suddenly transformed into the most ethereal  of the creatures of earth, with an exquisite beauty that cannot fail  to attract admiration, with wings of most delicate structure for  flying through the air, with eyes of a thousand facets, with organs of  smell that baffle the ingenuity of man to explain, with vibrant  antennae, and a slender tongue adapted to feeding upon the nectar of  flowers--the most ambrosial of natural food. So it is not strange that  this emergence of a butterfly has long been the theme both of poets  and theologians and that it attracts the admiring attention of  childhood, youth, and age.    Fortunately, this change from chrysalis to butterfly may readily be  observed by any one who will take a little trouble to rear the  caterpillars or to watch chrysalids found outdoors. The precise method  of eclosion, as we call this new kind of \"hatching,\" varies somewhat  with different species but in general the process is similar in all.    Those chrysalids which have a light colored outer skin are especially  desirable if we would watch this process. One can see through the  semi-transparent membrane the developing butterfly within, until  finally, just before it is ready to break out, the markings of the  wings and body show distinctly. If at this time the chrysalis is  placed in the sunshine it is likely to come out at once, so that you  can observe it readily. It usually breaks apart over the head and the  newly released legs quickly grasp hold of the empty skin as well as of  the support to which it is attached. It then hangs downward with a  very large abdomen and with the wings more or less crumpled up, but  decidedly larger than when they were confined within the chrysalis.  The wings, however, soon begin to lengthen as they are stretched out,  probably through the filling of the space by the body juices.  Commonly, the hind pair of wings become full size before the front  ones. In a short time the wings attain their full size, the abdomen  becomes smaller, through the discharge of a liquid called meconium,  and the butterfly is likely to walk a few steps to a better position  where it will rest quietly for an hour or two while body and wing  tissues harden. After this it is likely to fly away to lead the free  life of a butterfly. (_See plate, page 16._)    These changes from larva to chrysalis and from chrysalis to adult in  the case of the Monarch Butterfly are illustrated on the plates  opposite pages 32-33. A little study of these photographs from life  will help greatly to an understanding of the process.    Some very interesting observations have been made by Mr. J. Alston  Moffat upon the method of the expansion of the wings. In summarizing  his investigations he writes:    \"When a wing is fully expanded, and for an hour or two after, the  membranes can be easily separated. Entrance for a pin-point between  them is to be found at the base of the wing where the subcostal and  median nervures come close together. The membranes are united at the  costal and inner edges, which have to be cut to get them apart; but  they are free at the outer angle. At that time the nervures are in two  parts, half in one membrane and half in the other, and open in the  centre. The fluid which has been stored up in the pupa enters the  winglet at the opening referred to, expanding the membranes as it  passes along between them, and the nervures at the same time, and when  it has extended to every portion of the wing, then it is fully  expanded. The expanding fluid is of a gummy consistency, and as it  dries, cements the membranes together, also the edges of the  half-nervures, and produces the hollow tubes with which we are so  familiar.\"          BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS      The butterflies and moths both belong to the great order of  scale-winged insects--the Lepidoptera. They are distinguished,  however, by certain general characteristics, which hold true for the  most part in both groups. The butterflies fly by day; the moths fly"]]]
