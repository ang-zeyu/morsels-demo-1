He was sure they  were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign  significance.  The wood on either side was full of singular noises,  among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers in  an unknown tongue.    His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly  swollen.  He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had  bruised it.  His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them.  His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting  it forward from between his teeth into the cold air.  How softly the  turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the  roadway beneath his feet!    Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking,  for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a  delirium.  He stands at the gate of his own home.  All is as he left  it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine.  He must  have traveled the entire night.  As he pushes open the gate and passes  up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his  wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to  meet him.  At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile  of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity.  Ah, how  beautiful she is!  He springs forwards with extended arms.  As he is  about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck;  a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the  shock of a cannon--then all is darkness and silence!    Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently  from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#3)"],[1,"in the spectator just such a balanced  relation of impulses of attention and incipient movements as  suits an organism which is also balanced--bilateral--in its  own impulses to movement, and at the same time stable; and it  is the correspondence of the suggested impulses with the  natural movement that makes the composition good.  Besides the  pleasure from the tone relations,--which doubtless can be  eventually reduced to something of the same kind,--it is the  balance of nervous and muscular tensions and relaxations, of  yearnings and satisfactions, which are the subjective side of  the beauty of a strain of music.  The basis, in short, of any  aesthetic experience--poetry, music, painting, and the rest--  is beautiful through its harmony with the conditions offered  by our senses, primarily of sight and hearing, and through  the harmony of the suggestions and impulses it arouses with  the whole organism.    But the sensuous beauty of art does not exhaust the aesthetic  experience.  What of the special emotions--the gayety or  triumph, the sadness or peace or agitation--that hang about  the work of art, and make, for many, the greater part of their  delight in it?  Those among these special emotions which belong  to the subject-matter of a work--like our horror at the picture  of an execution--need not here be discussed.  To understand the  rest we may venture for a moment into the realm of pure  psychology.  We are told by psychology that emotion is dependent  on the organic excitations of any given idea.  Thus fear at the  sight of a bear is only the reverberation in consciousness of  all nervous and vascular changes set up instinctively as a  preparation for flight.  Think away our bodily feelings, and  we think away fear, too.  And set up the bodily changes and the  feeling of them, and we have the emotion that belongs to them  even without the idea, as we may see in the unmotived panics  that sometimes accompany certain heart disturbances.  The same  thing, on another level, is a familiar experience.  A glass of  wine makes merriment, simply by bringing about those organic  states which are felt emotionally as cheerfulness.  Now the  application of all this to aesthetics is clear.  All these  tensions, relaxations,--bodily \"imitations\" of the form,--have  each the emotional tone which belongs to it.  And so if the  music of a Strauss waltz makes us gay, and Handel's Largo  serious, it is not because we are reminded of the ballroom or  of the cathedral, but because the physical response to the  stimulus of the music is itself the basis of the emotion.  What makes the sense of peace in the atmosphere of the Low  Countries?  Only the tendency, on following those level lines  of landscape, to assume ourselves the horizontal, and the  restfulness which belongs to that posture.  If the crimson of  a picture by Bocklin, or the golden glow of a Giorgione, or  the fantastic gleam of a Rembrandt speaks to me like a human  voice, it is not because it expresses to me an idea, but  because it impresses that sensibility which is deeper than  ideas,--the region of the emotional response to color and to  light.  What is the beauty of the \"Ulalume,\" or \"Kubla Khan,\"  or \"Ueber allen Gipfeln\"?  It is the way in which the form  in its exquisite fitness to our senses, and the emotion  belonging to that particular form as organic reverberation  therefrom, in its exquisite fitness to thought, create in us  a delight quite unaccounted for by the ideas which they  express.  This is the essence of beauty,--the possession of  a quality which excites the human organism to functioning  harmonious with its own nature.    We can see in this definition the possibility of an aesthetic  which shall have objective validity because founded in the  eternal properties of human nature, while it yet allows us to  understand that in the limits within which, by education and  environment, the empirical man changes, his norms of beauty  must vary, too.  Ideas can change in interest and in value,  but these energies lie much deeper than the idea, in the  original constitution of mankind.  They belong to the  instinctive, involuntary part of our nature.  They are  changeless, just as the \"eternal man\" is changeless; and as  the basis of aesthetic feeling they can be gathered into a  system of laws which shall be subject to no essential  metamorphosis.  So long as we laugh when we are joyful, and  weep when we are sick and sorry; so long as we flush with  anger, or grow pale with fear, so long shall we thrill to a  golden sunset, the cadence of an air, or the gloomy spaces  of a cathedral.    The study of these forms of harmonious functioning of the  human organism has its roots, of course, in the science of  psychology, but comes, nevertheless, to a different flower,  because of the grafting on of the element of aesthetic value.  It is the study of the disinterested human pleasures, and,  although as yet scarcely well begun, capable of a most  detailed and definitive treatment.    This is not the character of those studies so casually alluded  to by the author of \"Impressionism and Appreciation,\" when he  enjoins on the appreciative critic not to neglect the literature  of aesthetics:  \"The characteristics of his [the artist's]  temperament have been noted with the nicest loyalty; and  particularly the play of his special faculty, the imagination,  as this faculty through the use of sensations and images and  moods and ideas creates a work of art, has been followed out  with the utmost delicacy of observation.\"  But these are not  properly studies in aesthetics at all.  To find out what is  beautiful, and the reason for its being beautiful, is the  aesthetic task; to analyze the workings of the poet's mind,  as his conception grows and ramifies and brightens, is no part  of it, because such a study takes no account of the aesthetic  value of the process, but only of the process itself.  The  same fallacy lurks here, indeed, as in the confusion of the  scientific critic between literary evolution and poetic  achievement, and the test of the fallacy is this single fact:  the psychological process in the development of a dramatic  idea, for instance, is, and quite properly should be, from  the point of view of such analysis, exactly the same for a  Shakespeare and for the Hoyt of our American farces.    The cause of the production of a work of art may indeed by  found by tracing back the stream of thought; but the cause  of its beauty is the desire and the sense of beauty in the  human heart.  If a given combination of lines and colors is  beautiful, then the anticipation of the combination as  beautiful is what has brought about its incarnation.  The  artist's attitude toward his vision of beauty, and the art  lover's toward that vision realized, are the same.  The only  legitimate aesthetic analysis is, then, that of the relation  between the aesthetic object and the lover of beauty, and all  the studies in the psychology of invention--be it literary,  scientific, or practical invention--have no right to the  other name.    Aesthetics, then, is the science of beauty.  It will be  developed as a system of laws expressing the relation between  the object and aesthetic pleasure in it; or as a system of  conditions to which the object, in order to be beautiful,  must conform.  It is hard to say where the task of the  aesthetician ends, and that of the critic begins; and for  the present, at least, they must often be commingled.  But  they are defined by their purposes:  the end and aim of one  is a system of principles; of the other, the disposal of a  given work with reference to those principles; and when the  science of aesthetics shall have taken shape, criticism will  confine itself to the analysis of the work into its aesthetic  elements, to the explanation (by means of the laws already  formulated) of its especial power in the realm of beauty,  and to the judgment of its comparative aesthetic value.    The other forms of critical activity will then find their  true place as preliminaries or supplements to the essential  function of criticism.  The study of historical conditions,  of authors' personal relations, of the literary \"moment,\"  will be means to show the work of art \"as in itself it really  is.\"  Shall we then say that the method of appreciation, being  an unusually exhaustive presentment of the object as in itself  it really is, is therefore an indispensable preparation for  the critical judgment?  The modern appreciator, after the  model limned by Professor Gates, was to strive to get, as it  were, the aerial perspective of a masterpiece,--to present it  as it looks across the blue depths of the years.  This is  without doubt a fascinating study; but it may be questioned  if it does not darken the more important issue.  For it is  not the object as in itself it really is that we at last  behold, but the object disguised in new and strange trappings.  Such appreciation is to aesthetic criticism as the sentimental  to the naive poet in Schiller's famous antithesis.  The virtue  of the sentimental genius is to complete by the elements which  it derives from itself an otherwise defective object.  So the  aesthetic critic takes his natural need of beauty from the  object; the appreciative critic seeks a further beauty outside  of the object, in his own reflections and fancies about it.  But if we care greatly for the associations of literature, we  Are in danger of disregarding its quality.  A vast deal of  pretty sentiment may hang about and all but transmute the most  prosaic object.  A sedan chair, an old screen, a sundial,--to  quote only Austin Dobson,--need not be lovely in themselves to  serve as pegs to hang a poem on; and all the atmosphere of the  eighteenth century may be wafted from a jar of potpourri.  Read  a lyric instead of a rose jar, and the rule holds as well.  The  man of feeling cannot but find all Ranelagh and"]]]
