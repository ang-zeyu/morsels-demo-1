The advantage of such  a gun is obvious, as it enables a charge of buck-shot to be carried in  the left barrel, while the right is loaded with a heavy bullet that is  an admirable bone-smasher; it also supersedes the necessity of an extra  gun for small game, as it shoots No. 6 shot with equal pattern to the  best cylinder-bored gun.    There are many persons who prefer a '500 or a '450 Express to the '577  or the '400. I have nothing to say against them, but I prefer those I  have named, as the '577 is the most fatal weapon that I have ever used,  and with 6 or 6 1/2 drams of powder it is quite equal to any animal in  creation, provided the shot is behind the shoulder. This provision  explains my reason for insisting that all animals from a buffalo upwards  should be placed in a separate category, as it is frequently impossible  to obtain a shoulder shot, therefore the rifles for exceedingly heavy  game must be specially adapted for the work required, so as to command  them in every conceivable position.    I have shot with every size of rifle from a half pounder explosive  shell, and I do not think any larger bore is actually necessary than a  No. 8, with a charge of 12 or 14 drams of powder. Such a rifle should  weigh 15 lbs., and the projectile would weigh 3 ounces of hardened  metal.    The rifles that I have enumerated would be always double, but should the  elephant-hunter desire anything more formidable, I should recommend a  single barrel of 36 inches in length of bore, weighing 22 lbs., and  sighted most accurately to 400 yards. Such a weapon could be used by a  powerful man from the shoulder at the close range of fifty yards, or it  could be fired at long ranges upon a pivot rest, which would enable the  elephant-hunter to kill at a great distance by the shoulder shot when  the animals were in deep marshes or on the opposite side of a river. I  have frequently seen elephants in such positions when it was impossible  to approach within reasonable range. A rifle of this description would  carry a half-pound shell with an exploding charge of half an ounce of  fine grain powder and the propelling charge would be 16 drams. I had a  rifle that carried a similar charge, but unfortunately it was too short,  and was only sighted for 100 yards. Such a weapon can hardly be classed  among sporting rifles, but it would be a useful adjunct to the battery  of a professional hunter in Africa.    There can be little doubt that a man should not be overweighted, but  that every person should be armed in proportion to his physical  strength. If he is too light for a very heavy rifle he must select a  smaller bore; if he is afraid of a No. 8 with 14 drams, he must be  content with a No. 12 and 10 drams, but although he may be successful  with the lighter weapon, he must not expect the performance will equal  that of the superior power.    It may therefore be concluded that for a man of ordinary strength, the  battery for the heaviest game should be a pair of double No. 8 rifles  weighing 14 or 15 lbs. to burn from 12 to 14 drams of powder, with a  hardened bullet of 3 ounces. Such a rifle will break the bones of any  animal from an elephant downwards, and would rake a buffalo from end to  end, which is a matter of great importance when the beast is charging.    Although the rifle is now thoroughly appreciated, and sportsmen of  experience have accepted the Express as embodying the correct principle  of high velocity, I differ with many persons of great authority in the  quality of projectiles, which require as much consideration as the  pattern of the gun.    The Express rifle is a term signifying velocity, and this is generally  accompanied by a hollow bullet which is intended to serve two purposes--  to lighten the bullet, and therefore to reduce the work of the powder,  and to secure an expansion and smash-up of the lead upon impact with the  animal. I contend that the smashing up of the bullet is a mistake,  excepting in certain cases such as I have already mentioned, where the  animal is small and harmless like the black-buck, which inhabits level  plains in the vicinity of population, and where the bullet would be  exceedingly dangerous should it pass through the antelope and ricochet  into some unlucky village.    As I have already advised the purchaser of a rifle to consider the  purpose for which he requires the weapon, in like manner I would suggest  that he should reflect upon the special purpose for which he requires  the bullet. He should ask himself the questions--\"What is a bullet?\"  and \"What is the duty of a bullet?\"    A bullet is generally supposed to be a projectile capable of retaining  its component parts in their integrity. The duty of the bullet is to  preserve its direct course; it should possess a power of great  penetration, should not be easily deflected, and together with  penetrating power it should produce a stunning effect by an overpowering  striking energy.    How are we to combine these qualities? If the projectile has great  penetrating force it will pass completely through an animal, and the  striking energy will be diminished, as the force that should have been  expended upon the body is expending itself in propelling the bullet  after it has passed through the body. This must be wrong, as it is  self-evident that the striking energy or knock-down blow must depend  upon the resistance which the body offers to the projectile. If the  bullet remains within it, the striking energy; complete and entire,  without any waste whatever, remains within the body struck. If,  therefore, a bullet '577 of 648 grains propelled by 6 drams of powder  has at fifty yards a striking energy of 3500 foot pounds, that force is  expended upon the object struck,--provided it is stopped by the  opposing body.    We should therefore endeavour to prevent the bullet from passing through  an animal, if it is necessary to concentrate the full power of the  projectile upon the resisting body.    This is one reason adduced in favour of the hollow Express bullet, which  smashes up into minute films of lead when it strikes the hard muscles of  an animal, owing to its extreme velocity, and the weakness of its parts  through the hollowness of its centre.    I contend, on the contrary, that the bullet has committed suicide by  destroying itself, although its fragments may have fatally torn and  injured the vital organs of the wounded animal. The bullet has ceased to  exist, as it is broken into fifty shreds; therefore it is dead, as it is  no longer a compact body,--in fact, it has disappeared, although the  actual striking energy of a very inferior bullet may have been expended  upon the animal.    If the animal is small and harmless, this should be the desired result.  If, on the other hand, the animal should be large and dangerous, there  cannot be a greater mistake than the hollow Express projectile.    I have frequently heard persons of great experience dilate with  satisfaction upon the good shots made with their little '450 hollow  Express exactly behind the shoulder of a tiger or some other animal. I  have also heard of their failures, which were to themselves sometimes  incomprehensible. A solid Express '577 NEVER fails if the direction is  accurate towards a vital part. The position of the animal does not  signify; if the hunter has a knowledge of comparative anatomy (which he  must have, to be a thoroughly successful shot) he can make positively  certain of his game at a short distance, as the solid bullet will crash  through muscle, bone, and every opposing obstacle to reach the fatal  organ. If the animal be a tiger, lion, bear, or leopard, the bullet  should have the power to penetrate, but it should not pass completely  through. If it should be a wapiti, or sambur stag, the bullet should  also remain within, retained in all cases under the skin upon the side  opposite to that of entrance. How is this to be managed by the same  rifle burning the same charge of powder with a solid bullet?    The penetration must be arranged by varying the material of the bullet.  A certain number of cartridges should be loaded with bullets of extreme  hardness, intended specially for large thick-skinned animals; other  bullets should be composed of softer metal, which would expand upon the  resisting muscles but would not pass completely through the skin upon  the opposite side. The cartridges would be coloured for distinction.    If the metal is pure lead, the bullet '577, with an initial velocity of  1650 feet per second, will assuredly assume the form of a button  mushroom immediately upon impact, and it will increase in diameter as it  meets with resistance upon its course until, when expended beneath the  elastic hide upon the opposite side, it will have become fully spread  like a mature mushroom, instead of the button shape that it had assumed  on entrance. I prefer pure lead for tigers, lions, sambur deer, wapiti,  and such large animals which are not thick-skinned, as the bullet alters  its form and nevertheless remains intact, the striking energy being  concentrated within the body.    The difference in the striking energy of a hollow bullet from that of a  solid projectile is enormous, owing to the inequality in weight. The  hollow bullet wounds mortally, but it does not always kill neatly. I  have seen very many instances where the '500 hollow Express with 5 drams  of powder has struck an animal well behind the shoulder, or sometimes  through the shoulder, and notwithstanding the fatal wound, the beast has  galloped off as though untouched, for at least a hundred yards, before  it fell suddenly, and died.    This is clumsy shooting. The solid bullet of pure lead would have killed  upon the spot, as the bullet would have retained its substance although  it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36645"],[0,"Louisiana Beef Cattle (#3)"],[1,"era, which attracted the genius of the  country and brought about the perfection of methods and combinations in  almost every known line, with the result that no longer is there any  general field of opportunity therein.    Another era has now arrived, which again focuses the minds of thinking  men upon the greatest of all problems--supplying the human race with  food--because of the imperative need of increasing the world's food  supply, and because of the large profit therein.    In the United States today, the production of live stock is the greatest  field of opportunity open to men of brains and capital; and it is, above  all, the one industry that now attracts the genius of men of large  affairs, and the great aggregations of capital.    In 1895 the average price of beef cattle in the principal markets of  this country was $4.40 per hundredweight; in 1900, it had increased to  $5.80; in 1907 the average was $7.60; in 1910, $8.85; in 1911, $9.35; in  1912, $10.25; in 1915, $11.60; and in 1916, about $11.90 per  hundredweight.    The foregoing market prices tell the story of the cattle industry from a  financial standpoint.    The following prices paid in 1901 and in 1916 for prize-winning  exhibition beeves--at the International Live Stock Exposition held  annually in Chicago, at the Union Stock Yards--well illustrate the trend  of the cattle market:    In 1901, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was two-year-old  stock, weighing an average of 1,497 pounds, and sold in the auction ring  at $12 per hundredweight.    In 1916, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was one-year-old  stock, weighing an average of 1,146 pounds, and sold in the auction ring  at $28 per hundredweight.    In 1901, the Grand Champion Steer was two years old, weighed 1,600  pounds, and sold in the auction ring at 50 cents per pound.    In 1916, the Grand Champion Steer was one year old, weighed 1,120  pounds, and sold in the auction ring at $1.75 per pound.    The following top prices were paid in the auction ring of the Exposition  for \"show cattle\" of various weights:        Cattle Weighing      Price in    Per Hundredweight       900 to 1050 pounds      1901          $ 8.70     900 to 1050 pounds      1916           17.75    1050 to 1200 pounds      1901            9.50    1050 to 1200 pounds      1916           28.00    1200 to 1350 pounds      1901            8.75    1200 to 1350 pounds      1916           20.00    1350 to 1500 pounds      1901           12.00    1350 to 1500 pounds      1916           18.50    1500 to 1900 pounds      1901            9.30    1500 to 1900 pounds      1916           15.75          [Illustration]          Transcriber's Notes:        Text in italics is enclosed with underscores: _italics_."]]]
