In 1978, all but three  whales departed the Bay after 16 days. In the summers of 1976-1978 two  influxes of whales occurred (Table 2). The Juraszs' define an influx  of whales as those whales that enter and remain in the Bay for a  minimum of three weeks. The second influx arrived 7-14 days after  extreme low tides occurred in late June-early July and presumably  moved into the Bay on flood tides. In 1979, a single influx comprised  of 3 whales entered the Bay. The age composition of identified whales  using Glacier Bay was categorized by the Juraszs' for 1976-1978 (Table  3).    During the period spent in the Bay, humpback whales have been observed  to feed on capelin, euphausiids (_Euphausia pacifica_), and pandalid  shrimp (_Pandulus borealis_). There appear to be three generalized  feeding relationships: 1) early-season feeding on shrimp in the upper  Bay; 2) mid-season feeding by concentrations of whales on capelin in  the lower Bay; and 3) late-season feeding (around August 5) by  concentrations of whales on euphausiids in mid-Bay.    Behaviorally, humpback whales appear to lunge up through concentrated  schools of prey during mid-season and use \"bubble-netting\" as a means  of concentrating less dense and/or numerically fewer prey earlier and  later in the season. In other areas of southeast Alaska, humpbacks are  reported to also feed on herring (_Clupea harengus pallasi_), shrimp,  and possibly other small schooling (swarming) prey. The Juraszs'  believe that humpbacks establish feeding territories in the Bay, and  have described eight \"stress behaviors\" associated with violations of  those territories (Table 4). The data collected by the Juraszs are  extensive (including human use of Glacier Bay) but have not yet been  completely analyzed.        [Footnote 3: This summary is based on information provided at        the meeting by Charles and Virginia Jurasz.]      =Human Use of Glacier Bay=[4]    John Muir popularized Glacier Bay, leading to tourist activity into  the early 1900's, when loose ice resulting from earthquake activity  prevented cruise vessels from operating within the Bay. Glacier Bay  was designated a National Monument February 26, 1925, the area being  added to April 18, 1939.    Vessel and tourist numbers remained low until the late 1960's-early  1970's. Close to 100 percent of the visitors to the Bay use vessels,  either entering the Bay aboard them or making use of them to tour the  Bay after arriving by aircraft. The Juraszs' developed a  classification scheme for vessels and aircraft based upon activities  of the craft in the Bay, their size, hull design, and engine  characteristics (Table 5).     TABLE 4.

(Data included in Table 6 cannot be compared to data  presented in Table 7 because of difference in methods of data  collection, sample area, time, effort, etc.)    Commercial fishing vessel activity in the Bay was probably low until  the 1970's. Since 1972 (it is not known whether data are available  prior to 1972) commercial fishing vessel visits have fluctuated  (Figure 4), but fishing activity has been greatest during the summer  months (Figure 5). Sport fishing visits have increased during the same  time period (Figure 6).        [Footnote 4: This summary is based on information presented at        the meeting by Mr. John Chapman and Charles and Virginia        Jurasz.]          POSSIBLE CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN USE OF GLACIER BAY  AND THE DISPLACEMENT OF HUMPBACK WHALES FROM THE BAY[5]      The meeting participants agreed that the observed decrease in the  number of whales in Lynn Canal in 1974 and Glacier Bay in 1978 may be  attributable to a number or combination of factors. Available evidence  suggests human activity was at least one of the causes, or served to  trigger otherwise \"natural events\". In Lynn Canal, humpback whales  were known to feed on herring (_Clupea harengus pallasi_). In 1974,  the year a herring fishery began, the number of humpback whales  dropped to one (Table 1). Between 1974 and 1978 fishing continued.  There was no fishing in 1979.    Use of the Canal by Class 5 vessels (cabin cruisers with high RPM  outdrive units) increased by 15-20 percent each year after 1970  (Jurasz and Jurasz, 1979, p. 85). Three humpback whales were seen in  Lynn Canal during the 1975-1977 seasons, the number increasing to five  in 1978-1979. The relationship between vessel activity, fishing  effort, fish take, fish abundance, and the presence and activity of  whales in Lynn Canal does not appear to be documented.    In Glacier Bay, increased vessel traffic may be one of the factors  responsible for the movement of humpback whales from the Bay in 1978  and 1979. The Juraszs' data, while not evaluated fully, suggest that  there has been a general increase in avoidance by humpback whales of  Class 1 through 5 vessels over the three year period, 1976-1978.

He said I must be possessed of miraculous power, or  they would have charged and slain me. The next day, fever laid me low,  and, though the attack was slight, some days elapsed before I could  muster strength to take me back to Taveta.    After a few days' rest in camp--strengthened by good food and spurred to  fresh exertion by the barren result of my first effort--I set out again,  accompanied by more men and in a different direction.    My faith in myself received a pleasant encouragement the day before my  departure. My head man came to me and said trade was at a standstill,  and that the natives could not be induced to bring food to sell. On  asking him why, I learned that the Taveta people had found three dead  hippos in Lake Jipe and one rhino near its shores. Meat--a rare treat to  them, even when not quite fresh--filled their minds and bodies, and they  were proof even against the most tempting beads and the brightest  cloths. I cannot say that I shared my head man's anxiety. The fact that  I had not labored altogether in vain, even though others reaped the  benefit of my efforts, filled me with a certain satisfaction.    A day's march from Taveta brought me to the banks of an almost stagnant  brook, where I made camp. The country round about was a plain studded  with low hills, here thinly thatched with short grass, and there  shrouded with thick bush, above which every now and then rose a giant  acacia. The morning after my arrival, I set out from camp with my 8-bore  in my hands and hope in my heart. Not 200 yards from my tent, I was  startled by a snort and then by the sight of two rhinos dashing across  my path some fifty yards away. This time I did not succumb to my gun's  recoil, but had the doubtful satisfaction of seeing, from a standing  position, the animals disappear in the bush. I made after them and  found, to my delight, a clear trail of fresh blood. Eagerly pressing on,  I was somewhat suddenly checked in my career by almost stumbling over a  rhino apparently asleep on its side, with its head toward me. Bang! went  the 8-bore and down I went. I was the only creature disturbed by the  shot, as the rhino had been dead some minutes--slain by my first shot;  and my satisfaction was complete when I found the hole made by my  bullet. My men shouted and sang over this, the first fruits of my  expedition, and even at this late day I forgive myself for the feeling  of pride I then experienced. I have a table at home made of a piece of  this animal's hide, and supported in part by one of its horns.    The next day I made an early start and worked till 4 o'clock P. M., with  no result. Then, being some eight miles from camp, I turned my face  toward home. I had not gone far, and had reached the outskirts of an  almost treeless savanna, when my gun-bearer brought me to a halt by the  word _mbogo_. This I knew meant buffalo. I adjusted my glass and  followed the direction of my man's finger. There, 500 yards away, I saw  a solitary buffalo feeding slowly along toward two low bushes, but on  the further side of them. I did not think what rifle I held (it was a  .450), but dashed forward at once. My gun-bearer was more thoughtful and  brought with him my .577. We actually ran. When within eighty or ninety  yards of the two bushes behind which the beast was now hidden. I  slackened pace and approached more cautiously. My heart was beating and  my hands trembling with the exertion of running when I reached the  nearest bush, and my nerves were not exactly steadied by meeting the  vicious gaze of a large buffalo, who stood not thirty feet on the other  side. My gun-bearer in an instant forced the .577 into my hands, and I  took aim at the shoulder of the brute and fired, without knowing exactly  what I was doing. The smoke cleared, and there, almost in his tracks,  lay my first buffalo. His ignorance of my noisy and careless approach  was apparently accounted for by his great age. His hide was almost  hairless and his horns worn blunt with many encounters. He must have  been quite deaf and almost blind, or his behavior cannot be accounted  for. The noise made by our approach, even with the favorable wind, was  sufficient to frighten any animal, or at least put it on its guard.    My men, who were dreadfully afraid of big game of all sorts, when they  saw the buffalo lying dead, danced with joy and exultation. They kicked  the dead body and shouted curses at it. Camp was distant a good two  hours' march, and the day was drawing to a close. The hungry howl of the  hyenas warned me that my prize would soon be taken from me were it left  unguarded. So piles of firewood were made and the carcass surrounded by  a low wall of flames. I left three men in charge and set out for camp.  There was but little light and my way lay through bits of forest and  much bush. Our progress was slow, and my watch read 10:30 P. M. before I  reached my tent and bed.    The following day I set out for a shooting ground distant two days'  march from where I had been camped. Several rivers lay in my path and  two tribes of natives. These natives inhabit thick forest and are in  terror of strangers, as they are continually harassed by their  neighbors. When they saw the smallness of my force, however, they  endeavored to turn me aside, but without success. Quiet and  determination generally win with these people. The rivers gave me more  trouble, as they were deep and swift of current, and my friends, the  natives, had removed all bridges. But none of the streams exceeded  thirty feet in width, and an hour's hard work with our axes always  provided us with a bridge.    The second day from my former camp brought me to the outskirts of the  forest and the beginning of open country. I had hardly made camp before  three Swahili traders came to me, and after the usual greetings began to  weep in chorus. Their story was a common one. They had set out from  Mombasa with twelve others to trade for slaves and ivory with the  natives who inhabit the slopes of Kilimanjaro. Fortune had favored them,  and after four months they were on their way homeward with eighteen  slaves and five good sized tusks. The first day's journey was just over  when they were attacked by natives, three of their number slain and all  their property stolen. In the darkness they could not distinguish what  natives attacked them; but their suspicions rested on the very tribe  among whom they had spent the four months, and from whom they had  purchased the ivory and slaves. I gave them a little cloth and some  food, and a note to my people at Taveta to help them on their way. Of  course, they were slave traders, and as such ought possibly to have been  beaten from my camp. But it is undoubtedly a fact that Mahomedans look  on slave trading as a perfectly legitimate occupation; and if people are  not breaking their own laws, I cannot see that a stranger should treat  them as brigands and refuse them the least aid when in distress. I know  that my point of view in this matter has few supporters in civilization.    The next day, after a short march, I pitched my tent on the banks of a  small stream, and then set out to prospect for game. I found nothing,  but that night my slumbers were disturbed by the splashing and grunting  of a herd of buffalo drinking.    These sounds kept me awake, so that I was enabled to make a very early  start--setting out with four men at 4:45. The natives had assured me  that the buffalo came to drink about midnight, and then fed slowly back  to their favorite sleeping-places in the thick bush, reaching there just  about sunrise. By making such an early start I hoped to come up with my  quarry in the open places on the edge of the thick bush just before  dawn, when the light is sufficiently bright to enable one to see the  foresight of a rifle. Dew falls like rain in this part of the world, and  we had not gone fifty paces in the long grass before we were soaking  wet, and dismally cold to boot. My guide, cheered by the prospect of a  good present, led us confidently along the most intricate paths and  through the thickest bush. The moon overhead, which was in its  fifteenth day, gave excellent light. Every now and then some creature  would dash across our path, or stand snorting fearfully till we had  passed. These were probably waterbuck and bushbuck. Toward half past  five the light of the moon paled before the first glow of dawn, and we  found ourselves on the outskirts of a treeless prairie, dotted here and  there with bushes and covered with short dry grass. Across this plain  lay the bush where my guide assured me the buffalo slept during the day,  and according to him at that moment somewhere between me and this bush  wandered at least 100 buffalo. There was little wind, and what there was  came in gentle puffs against our right cheeks. I made a sharp detour to  the left, walking quickly for some twenty minutes. Then, believing  ourselves to be below the line of the buffalo, and therefore free to  advance in their direction, we did so.    Just as the sun rose we had traversed the plain and stood at the edge of  what my men called the _nyumba ya mbogo_ (the buffalo's home). We were  too late. Fresh signs everywhere showed that my guide had spoken the  truth. Now I questioned him as to the bush; how thick it was, etc. At  that my men fidgeted uneasily and murmured \"Mr. Dawnay.\" This young  Englishman had been killed by buffalo in the bush but four months  before. However, two of my men volunteered to follow me, so I set out on  the track of the herd.    This bush in which the buffalo live is not more than ten feet high, is  composed of a network of branches and is covered with shiny green  leaves; it has no thorns. Here and there one will meet with a stunted  acacia, which, as if to show its spite against its more attractive  neighbors, is clothed with "]]]
