DRYMORNIS BRIDGESI                             199          INTRODUCTION.      As regards its Bird-life the Neotropical Region, which, according to the  arrangement usually adopted, consists of America south of the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec together with the West Indies[1], may be most conveniently  divided into six Subregions. These are:--      [1] _Cf._ Sclater, Journ. Linn. Soc., Zool. ii. p. 143 (1857).    1. The _Transpanamic Subregion_, embracing the great Central-American  Isthmus from Tehuantepec down to Panama.    2. The _Antillean Subregion_, containing the West-India Islands.    3. The _Colombian Subregion_, containing the South-American littoral and  the adjacent Andean ranges in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and  Bolivia.    4. The _Amazonian Subregion_, containing Guiana and the valleys of the  Orinoco and Amazons and their confluents.    5. The _Brazilian Subregion_, containing the great wooded and campos  districts of Southern Brazil and Paraguay.    6. The _Patagonian Subregion_, consisting of Antarctic America up to the  Brazilian wood-districts and the highlands of Bolivia on the eastern  side of the Andes, and apparently extending as far as the Gulf of  Guayaquil on the west.    It is, of course, impossible to draw a precise line between these six  Subregions, and any boundaries assigned to them can only be regarded as  approximative; but it is obvious that nearly, if not quite, the whole of  the Argentine Republic, the Avifauna of which we are now considering,  comes within the limits of the Patagonian Subregion. It is possible that  the birds of the Territory of Misiones and of some parts of Northern  Corrientes may be more nearly akin to those of Brazil, but we may say  generally that the Argentine Republic belongs to the Patagonian  Subregion.    As shown in the succeeding pages, the number of species of Birds as yet  ascertained to be found within the Argentine Republic[2] is about 430.  We will now take the leading groups of the Neotropical Ornis, one after  another, and consider the _role_ they play in the Argentine Avifauna, so  as to get some general ideas as to its peculiarities.      [2] We have not included within the scope of the present work the    territory of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego, which are politically    part of the Argentine Republic, but only Northern Patagonia down to    the Rio Negro.    The subjoined Table contains in the first column the number of  Neotropical species assigned to each of the 20 different Orders of Birds  in the 'Nomenclator Avium Neotropicalium.' In the second column is given  the corresponding number of Argentine species of each order according to  the present work. The total number of Neotropical species will be seen  to be about eight times as many as those of the Argentine Avifauna;  so that where this average is exceeded in the individual orders the  particular group may be considered to be over-represented, and where it  is not reached to be under-represented in the Argentine Avifauna. This  is of course a very rough-and-ready mode of calculation, because it  assumes that every species has an equal area of distribution, which is  not ordinarily the case; but it will serve to give us some general ideas  on the subject. We will now proceed to consider the principal groups one  after another, and to point out their comparative importance in the  Argentine Avifauna.    The known Argentine Passeres, according to the present work, are 229 in  number; those of the Neotropical Region, according to the 'Nomenclator,'  are 1976; so that the species of Argentine Passeres, according to the  ratio which we have adopted, would be very little short of the average  numbers. If, however, we divide the Passeres up into the three suborders  of Oscines, Oligomyodae, and Tracheophonae, we shall find that the  Oligomyodae are rather in excess of the estimated average, while the  species of the two other groups are deficient. This arises mainly from  the large number of Tyrannidae belonging to the Argentine Ornis. Not less  than 63 species of this group have been already discovered within its  limits. Besides Tyrants, other prevailing families of Passeres in the  Argentine Avifauna are the Finches (Fringillidae) and the Wood-hewers  (Dendrocolaptidae), both of which have 46 representatives in the  Argentine Republic. Both these families are, however, well represented  all over the Neotropical Region. But the Tapacolas (Pteroptochidae) and  the Plant-cutters (Phytotomidae) are both of them families specially  characteristic of the Patagonian Avifauna, and both of them are  represented in the Argentine Republic. One other Passerine form is also  worthy of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38959"],[0,"Comparative Ecology of Pinyon Mice and Deer Mice in Mesa Verde National Park, (#3)"],[1,"to that trapped in the  Morfield burn, but the Chapin Mesa site had not been burned.    Canopy vegetation is pinyon-juniper forest. A dense understory was made  up of _Amelanchier utahensis_ (serviceberry), _Cercocarpos montanus_  (mountain mahogany), _Purshia tridentata_ (bitterbrush), and _Quercus  gambelii_ (Gambel oak). The ground cover consisted of small clumps of  _Poa fendleriana_ (muttongrass), and _Koeleria cristata_ (Junegrass),  intermingled with growths of one or more of the following:      _Artemisia nova_    _Solidago petradoria_    _Sitanion hystrix_    _Astragalus scopulorum_    _Lupinus caudatus_    _Eriogonum alatum_    _Penstemon linarioides_    _Eriogonum racemosum_    _Eriogonum umbellatum_    _Polygonum sawatchense_    _Amelanchier utahensis_    _Purshia tridentata_    _Comandra umbellata_    Seeds of _Cercocarpos montanus_ covered the ground under the bushes in  much of the trapping area, and large numbers of juniper berries were on  the ground beneath the trees. Individuals of _P. truei_ and _P.  maniculatus_ were caught in this area (Table 1).    Several deer, rabbits, one coyote, and numerous birds were seen in the  area. No reptiles were noticed, but they were not searched for. A  mountain lion was seen in this general area two weeks after trapping was  completed.      _West of Far View Ruins_    Three pairs of traplines were run west of Far View Ruins in an area  comparable in vegetation, altitude, general topography, and  configuration to the area previously described. The elevations concerned  are typical of the middle parts of mesas throughout the park. This area  differs from the trapping area south of Far View Ruins and the one on  Morfield Ridge in being wider and on the western side of the mesa.    The woody understory was sparse in most places, and where present was  composed of _Cercocarpos montanus_, _Purshia tridentata_, _Fendlera  rupicola_ (fendlerbush), _Amelanchier utahensis_, _Quercus gambelii_,  and _Artemisia tridentata_ (sagebrush). The herbaceous ground cover was  dominated by _Solidago petradoria_ (rock goldenrod), and  grasses--including _Poa fendleriana_, _Oryzopsis hymenoides_, and  _Sitanion hystrix_. Other herbaceous species were as follows:      _Echinocercus coccineus_    _Achillea millefolium_    _Aster bigelovii_    _Wyethia arizonica_    _Lepidium montanum_    _Lupinus caudatus_    _Yucca baccata_    _Linum perenne_    _Eriogonum racemosum_    _Eriogonum umbellatum_    _Polygonum sawatchense_    _Delphinium nelsonii_    _Penstemon linarioides_    Fresh diggings of pocket gophers were observed along the trap lines.  Badger tunnels were noted in numerous surface mounds that are remnants  of prehistoric Indian dwellings, but no badgers were seen. Numerous deer  and several rabbits were present. Juncos, two species of jays, and  woodpeckers were seen daily. No reptiles were observed.    Both _Peromyscus maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ were caught in this area  (Table 1).      _Big Sagebrush Stand, South Chapin Mesa_    A circular trapline, 1,000 feet in circumference, was established on  November 16, 1961, in a stand of big sagebrush, and was operated for 30  consecutive nights.    The vegetation of the trapping area was predominantly _Artemisia  tridentata_ (big sagebrush), interspersed with a few scattered seedlings  of pinyon and juniper. This stand was burned in 1858 (tree-ring date by  David Smith) and some charred juniper snags still stood. The deep sandy  soil also supported a variety of grasses and a few other small plants.  The following species were common in this area:      _Bromus inermis_    _Oryzopsis hymenoides_    _Poa fendleriana_    _Sitanion hystrix_    _Solidago petradoria_    _Orthocarpus purpureo-albus_    The 15 to 20 acres of sagebrush were surrounded by pinyon-juniper  forest. The trapping station closest to the forest was approximately 100  feet from the edge of the woodland. More _P. truei_ than _P.  maniculatus_ were caught here (Table 1).      _East Loop Road, Chapin Mesa_    The trapping area lies north of Cliff Palace, eastward of the loop road,  at elevations of 6,875 to 6,925 feet. Two pairs of traplines were run  from January 9, 1962, to January 12, 1962, and from February 13 to 15,  1962.    Vegetation was pinyon-juniper woodland with an understory of mixed  shrubs. One to four inches of old snow covered the ground during most of  the trapping period, but the ground beneath trees and shrubs was  generally clear, providing suitable location for traps.    Numerous juncos and jays were seen in this area; deer and rabbits also  were present.    Individuals of _P. truei_ and of _P. maniculatus_ were taken (Table 1).      _Navajo Hill, Chapin Mesa_    Navajo Hill is the highest point (8,140 feet) on Chapin Mesa. The top of  the hill is rounded and the sides slope gently southward and westward  until they level out into mesa-top terrain at elevations of 7,950 to  8,000 feet. The northern and eastern slopes of the hill drop abruptly  into the respective canyon slopes of the East Fork of Navajo Canyon and  the West Fork of Little Soda Canyon. The gradually tapering southwestern  slope of the hill extends southward for one mile and is bisected by the  main highway, which runs the length of the mesa top.    Heavy growths of grasses cover the ground; _Amelanchier utahensis_,  _Cercocarpos montanus_, and _Fendlera rupicola_ comprise the only tall  vegetation. Trees are lacking on this part of the mesa, except on the  canyon slopes, where _Quercus gambelii_ forms an almost impenetrable  barrier.    Four traplines were run from May 4-7, 1962, and from May 9-12, 1962. _P.  maniculatus_ was taken but _P. truei_ was not present here in 1962, or  in 1964 or 1965 when additional trapping was performed as a check on  populations (Table 1).    Other species trapped include the montane vole, long-tailed vole, and  Colorado chipmunk. Mule deer and coyotes were abundant in the area.  Striped whipsnakes, rattlesnakes and gopher snakes are known to occur in  this vicinity (Douglas, 1966).      _North End Wetherill Mesa_    In 1934 a widespread fire deforested large areas of pinyon-juniper  woodland on the northern end of Wetherill Mesa. The current vegetation  consists of shrubs with a dense ground cover of grasses. Many dead trees  still remain on the ground, providing additional cover for wildlife.    The trapping area was a wide, grassy meadow, three and a half miles  south of the northern end of the mesa. A pronounced drainage runs  through this area and empties into Rock Canyon. Four traplines were run  parallel to each other. The first lines were established on May 23,  1962, and the second pair on June 3, 1962.    Another pair of lines was run in a grassy area two miles south of the  northern escarpment of Wetherill Mesa. This area was one and a half  miles north of the above-mentioned area. These lines ran along the  eastern side of a drainage leading into Long Canyon. The vegetation was  essentially the same in both areas, and they will be considered  together.    The vegetation was composed predominantly of grasses. _Quercus gambelii_  and _Amelanchier utahensis_ were the codominant shrubs. _Artemisia  tridentata_ and _Chrysothamnus depressus_ (dwarf rabbitbrush), were  common. Plants in the two areas included the following:      _Juniperus scopulorum_    _Symphoricarpos oreophilus_    _Artemisia ludoviciana_    _Sitanion hystrix_    _Stipa comata_    _Astragalus scopulorum_    _Artemisia tridentata_    _Chrysothamnus depressus_    _Helianthus annuus_    _Tetradymia canescens_    _Quercus gambelii_    _Bromus tectorum_    _Poa fendleriana_    _Lupinus caudatus_    _Yucca baccata_    _Sphaeralcea coccinea_    _Eriogonum umbellatum_    _Amelanchier utahensis_    _Fendlera rupicola_    _Lomatium pinatasectum_    Individuals of _P. maniculatus_ and of _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ were  caught (Table 1).
