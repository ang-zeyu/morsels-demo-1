Sanders did not come the next day, nor the next. He was moving  leisurely, traversing a country where many misunderstandings existed  that wanted clearing up. When he arrived, having sent a messenger ahead  to carry the news of his arrival, he found the city peaceably engaged.    The women were crushing corn, the men smoking, the little children  playing and sprawling about the streets.    He halted at the outskirts of the city, on a hillock that commanded the  main street, and sent for the regent.    \"Why must I send for you?\" he asked. \"Why does the king remain in his  city when I come? This is shame.\"    \"Master,\" said Sato-Koto, \"it is not fitting that a great king should so  humble himself.\"    Sanders was neither amused nor angry. He was dealing with a rebellious  people, and his own fine feelings were as nothing to the peace of the  land.    \"It would seem that the king has had bad advisers,\" he reflected aloud,  and Sato-Koto shuffled uneasily.    \"Go, now, and tell the king to come--for I am his friend.\"    The regent departed, but returned again alone.    \"Lord, he will not come,\" he said sullenly.    \"Then I will go to him,\" said Sanders.    King Peter, sitting before his hut, greeted Mr. Commissioner with  downcast eyes.    Sanders' soldiers, spread in a semi-circle before the hut, kept the  rabble at bay.    \"King,\" said Sanders--he carried in his hand a rattan cane of familiar  shape, and as he spoke he whiffled it in the air, making a little  humming noise--\"stand up!\"    \"Wherefore?\" said Sato-Koto.    \"That you shall see,\" said Sanders.    The king rose reluctantly, and Sanders grabbed him by the scruff of his  neck.    Swish!    The cane caught him most undesirably, and he sprang into the air with a  yell.    Swish, swish, swish!    Yelling and dancing, throwing out wild hands to ward off the punishment,  King Peter blubbered for mercy.    \"Master!\" Sato-Koto, his face distorted with rage, reached for his  spear.    \"Shoot that man if he interferes,\" said Sanders, without releasing the  king.    The regent saw the levelled rifles and stepped back hastily.    \"Now,\" said Sanders, throwing down the cane, \"now we will play a little  game.\"    \"Wow-wow--oh, ko!\" sobbed his majesty.    \"I go back to the forest,\" said Sanders. \"By and by a messenger shall  come to you, saying that the Commissioner is on his way. Do you  understand?\"    \"Yi-hi!\" sobbed the king.    \"Then will you go out with your councillors and your old men and await  my coming according to custom. Is that clear?\"    \"Ye-es, master,\" whimpered the boy.    \"Very good,\" said Sanders, and withdrew his troops.    In half an hour came a grave messenger to the king, and the court went  out to the little hill to welcome the white man.    This was the beginning of King Peter's education, for thus was he taught  obedience.    Sanders went into residence in the town of Isisi, and held court.    \"Sato-Koto,\" he said on the second day, \"do you know the village of  Ikan?\"    \"Yes, master; it is two days' journey into the bush.\"    Sanders nodded.    \"You will take your wives, your children, your servants, and your  possessions to the village of Ikan, there to stay until I give you leave  to return. The palaver is finished.\"    Next came the chief of the Akasava, very ill at ease.    \"Lord, if any man says I did you wrong, he lies,\" said the chief.    \"Then I am a liar!\" said Sanders. \"For I say that you are an evil man,  full of cunning.\"    \"If it should be,\" said the chief, \"that you order me to go to my  village as you have ordered Sato-Koto, I will go, since he who is my  father is not pleased with me.\"    \"That I order,\" said Sanders; \"also, twenty strokes with a stick, for  the good of your soul. Furthermore, I would have you remember that down  by Tembeli on the great river there is a village where men labour in  chains because they have been unfaithful to the Government and have  practised abominations.\"    So the chief of the Akasava people went out to punishment.    There were other matters requiring adjustment, but they were of a minor  character, and when these were all settled to the satisfaction of  Sanders, but by no means to the satisfaction of the subjects, the  Commissioner turned his attention to the further education of the king.    \"Peter,\" he said, \"to-morrow when the sun comes up I go back to my own  village, leaving you without councillors.\"    \"Master, how may I do without councillors, since I am a young boy?\"  asked the king, crestfallen and chastened.    \"By saying to yourself when a man calls for justice: 'If I were this man  how should I desire the king's justice?'\"    The boy looked unhappy.    \"I am very young,\" he repeated; \"and to-day there come many from  outlying villages seeking redress against their enemies.\"    \"Very good,\" said Sanders. \"To-day I will sit at the king's right hand  and learn of his wisdom.\"    The boy stood on one leg in his embarrassment, and eyed Sanders askance.    There is a hillock behind the town. A worn path leads up to it, and  a-top is a thatched hut without sides. From this hillock you see the  broad river with its sandy shoals, where the crocodiles sleep with open  mouth; you see the rising ground toward Akasava, hills that rise one on  top of the other, covered with a tangle of vivid green. In this house  sits the king in judgment, beckoning the litigants forward. Sato-Koto  was wont to stand by the king, bartering justice.    To-day Sato-Koto was preparing to depart and Sanders sat by the king's  side.    There were indeed many litigants.    There was a man who had bought a wife, giving no less than a thousand  rods and two bags of salt for her. He had lived for three months with  her, when she departed from his house.    \"Because,\" said the man philosophically, \"she had a lover. Therefore,  Mighty Sun of Wisdom, I desire the return of my rods and my salt.\"    \"What say you?\" said Sanders.    The king wriggled uncomfortably.    \"What says the father?\" he said hesitatingly, and Sanders nodded.    \"That is a wise question,\" he approved, and called the father, a  voluble and an eager old man.    \"Now, king,\" he said hurriedly, \"I sold this woman, my daughter; how  might I know her mind? Surely I fulfil my contract when the woman goes  to the man. How shall a father control when a husband fails?\"    Sanders looked at the king again, and the boy drew a long breath.    \"It would seem, M'bleni, that the woman, your daughter, lived many years  in your hut, and if you do not know her mind you are either a great fool  or she is a cunning one. Therefore, I judge that you sold this woman  knowing her faults. Yet the husband might accept some risk also. You  shall take back your daughter and return 500 rods and a bag of salt, and  if it should be that your daughter marries again, you shall pay one-half  of her dowry to this man.\"    Very, very slowly he gave judgment, hesitatingly, anxiously, glancing  now and again to the white man for his approval.    \"That was good,\" said Sanders, and called forward another pleader.    \"Lord king,\" said the new plaintiff, \"a man has put an evil curse on me  and my family, so that they sicken.\"    Here was a little poser for the little judge, and he puzzled the matter  out in silence, Sanders offering no help.    \"How does he curse you?\" at last asked the king.    \"With the curse of death,\" said the complainant in a hushed voice.    \"Then you shall curse him also,\" said the king, \"and it shall be a  question of whose curse is the stronger.\"    Sanders grinned behind his hand, and the king, seeing the smile, smiled  also.    From here onward Peter's progress was a rapid one, and there came to  headquarters from time to time stories of a young king who was a Solomon  in judgment.    So wise he was (who knew of the formula he applied to each case?), so  beneficent, so peaceable, that the chief of the Akasava, from whom was  periodically due, took advantage of the gentle administration, and sent  neither corn nor fish nor grain. He did this after a journey to far-away  Ikan, where he met the king's uncle, Sato-Koto, and agreed upon common  action. Since the crops were good, the king passed the first fault, but  the second tribute became due, and neither Akasava nor Ikan sent, and  the people of Isisi, angry at the insolence, murmured, and the king sat  down in the loneliness of his hut to think upon a course which was just  and effective.           *     *     *     *     *    \"I really am sorry to bother you,\" wrote Sanders to the Administrator  again, \"but I shall have to borrow your Houssas for the Isisi country.  There has been a tribute palaver, and Peter went down to Ikan and wiped  up his uncle; he filled in his spare time by giving the Akasava the  worst licking they have ever had. I thoroughly approve of all that Peter  has done, because I feel that he is actuated only by the keenest sense  of justice and a desire to do the right thing at the right time--and it  was time Sato-Koto was killed--though I shall have to reprimand Peter  for the sake of appearances. The Akasava chief is in the bush, hiding.\"    Peter came back to his capital after his brief but strenuous campaign,  leaving behind him two territories that were all the better for his  visit, though somewhat sore.    The young king brought together his old men, his witch-doctors, and  other notabilities.    \"By all the laws of white men,\" he said, \"I have done wrong to Sandi,  because he has told"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#3)"],[1," have been shining for ages like a light in a dark  place. We will explore regions unknown to many; we will gaze upon the  opening glories which present themselves on every side, and feast our  souls with knowledge which is calculated in its nature to enlarge the  heart, to exalt the mind, and to raise the affections above the  little, mean, grovelling things of the world, and to make one wise  unto salvation.    But, first, for the definite rule of interpretation. For this we will  not depend on any man or commentary, for the Holy Ghost has given it  by the mouth of Peter: \"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the  Scripture is of any private interpretation.\" 2 Peter i, 20.    There is one grand division to be kept constantly, in view in the  study of prophecy; namely, the distinction between the past and the  future. The reader should be careful to ascertain what portion has  been fulfilled, and what remains to be fulfilled: always remembering  Peter's rule of interpretation will apply to both. Now, if we should  find in our researches that every prophecy which has been fulfilled to  the present year, has been _literally_ fulfilled, then it follows of  necessity that every prophecy which is yet future will not fail of a  _literal_ fulfilment. Let us commence with the days of Noah. Gen. vi,  17: \"And behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,  to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under  heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\"    In the verses which follow the above the Lord commands Noah to enter  the Ark, and take with him animals of every kind, etc. And in the 22d  verse it is written, \"Thus did Noah, according to all that God  commanded him, so did he.\" It was well for Noah that he was not well  versed in the spiritualizing systems of modern divinity; for, under  their benighted influence, he would never have believed that so  marvelous a prophecy would have had a literal meaning and  accomplishment. No, he would have been told that the flood meant a  spiritual flood, and the Ark a spiritual Ark, and, the moment he  thought otherwise, he would have been set down for a fanatic, knave,  or fool; but it was so, that he was just simple enough to believe the  prophecy literally. Here then is a fair sample of _foreknowledge_; for  all the world, who did not possess it, perished by the flood.    The next prediction we will notice is Gen. xv, 13-16. \"And he said  unto Abraham. Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a  land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict  them four hundred years. And also that nation, whom they shall serve,  will I judge; and afterwards shall they come out with great substance.  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a  good old age; but in the fourth generation they shall come hither  again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\"    The evil entreating of the children of Israel four hundred years,  together with their coming out with great substance, and the judgment  of God upon Egypt, as well as the death of Abraham in a good old age,  are all facts too well known to need comment here; suffice it to say,  that it is a striking example of the exact fulfilment of prophecy,  uttered more than four hundred years before it had its accomplishment.  From this we gather that none of those ancient men knew anything of  the modern system of spiritualizing.    Our next is Gen. xix, 12, 13: \"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou  here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and  whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: for we  will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before  the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.\" Now,  Lot being simple enough to believe the thing in its literal sense,  took as many of his family as would follow, and escaped for his life;  to the great amusement, no doubt, of the Sodomites, who probably stood  gazing after, crying \"Delusion, delusion!\" they thinking all the while  that the prophecy was only a figure. Here is an example of a man  escaping from the flames by _foreknowledge_ imparted to him, while the  whole city perished. O! what a blessing that Lot had no knowledge of  the modern manner of interpreting prophecy. If it had once entered his  heart that he must come out of Sodom spiritually, instead of  literally, it would have cost him his life.    Let us examine a prophecy of Joseph in the land of Egypt. Gen. xli,  29-31: \"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all  the land of Egypt: and there shall arise after them seven years of  famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;  and the famine shall consume the land: and the plenty shall not be  known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be  very grievous.\" Joseph then proceeds to give directions for corn to be  laid up in great abundance during the seven plenteous years, in order  to provide against the famine. And Pharaoh, being no better versed in  the school of modern divinity than his predecessors, never once  thought of any other interpretation but the most literal, And thus he  was the means, together with Joseph, in the hand of God, of saving,  not only their nation, but the house of Israel, from famine. This is  another striking example of the power of _foreknowledge_. _It_ not  only saved from famine, but it exalted Joseph from a dungeon to a  palace; from the lowest degradation to the highest honor; so that they  cried before him, \"Bow the knee!\" But, O! what death and mourning  would have followed had they dreamed only of spiritual famine and  spiritual corn.    Having given a few plain examples of early ages, we will lightly touch  upon some of the most remarkable events of prophecy, and its  fulfilment, until we come down to the Jewish Prophets, where the field  opens wide, touching in its progress the most remarkable events of all  ages, and terminating in a full development of the opening glories of  the last days.    One remarkable instance, concerning Elijah the Prophet, was, that he  prophesied to Ahab that it should not rain for three years and  upwards, which came to pass according to his word. There is also a  remarkable instance of Hazael, the Syrian, who came to Elisha to  inquire of the Lord concerning the king of Syria, his master, who was  sick. The Prophet, earnestly beholding him, burst into tears: and  Hazael asked him, saying, \"Why weepest thou?\" and he, answering, said,  \"The Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.\" And he  then proceeded to unfold unto him the cruelties which he would  afterwards exercise towards Israel, which are too horrible to mention  here, lest in so doing I might offend the delicate ear. But Hazael,  astonished to hear these things predicted concerning himself, which at  that time filled him with horror, exclaimed with surprise, \"But what?  is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?\" Yet  astonishing to tell, all was afterwards fulfilled to the very letter.    In the 21st chapter, 2 Chron., it is written that there came a writing  to Jehoram from Elijah, which, after stating the great wickedness of  which he had been guilty, in turning to idolatry, and also murdering  his brethren of his father's house, who were better than himself,  proceeds thus: \"Behold, with a great plague will the Lord smite thy  people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods; and thou  shalt have great sickness by disease of the bowels, until thy bowels  fall out, by reason of thy sickness, day by day.\" In the same chapter  it is written, that the Philistines and Arabians came against him, and  took his wives, and children, and goods captive; and after all this,  the Lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease, and his  bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, so he died of sore disease.    In the 6th chapter of Joshua, 26th verse, there is a wonderful  prediction concerning Jericho: \"Cursed be the man before the Lord,  that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho. He shall lay the  foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he  set up the gates of it.\"    After this curse the city of Jericho lay waste for ages, none daring  to rebuild it at the expense of their first-born and of their youngest  son; until after a long succession of judges and kings, when hundreds  of years had passed, Hiel the Bethelite, who lived in the days of  Ahab, probably supposing that the Lord had forgotten the curse  pronounced upon it by Joshua, ventured to rebuild the city: but no  sooner had he laid the foundation thereof than Abiram his first-born  died, and, still persevering in the hardness of his heart, he set up  the gates thereof, with the loss of his youngest son, Segub, according  to the word of the Lord by Joshua; see 1 Kings, xvi, 34. We might  fill a volume with instances of a similar kind, dispersed through the  historical part of the Scriptures; but we forbear, in order to hasten  to a more full examination of the books of the Jewish Prophets. We  shall trace them in their fulfilment upon Jerusalem, Babylon, Tyre,  Egypt, and various other nations.    Babylon, the most ancient and renowned city of the world, was  pleasantly situated on the banks of a majestic river, that flowed  through the plains of Shinar, near to which the tower of Babel once  stood. It was laid out four square, and surrounded with a wall upwards  of three hundred feet high, and sixty miles in circumference; having a  hundred gates of brass with bars of iron; twenty-five gates on each  side, which opened to streets running through the city, a distance of  fifteen miles; thus forming the whole city into exact squares of equal  size. In the midst of these squares were beautiful gardens, adorned  with trees and walks, diversified with flowers of varied hue; while "]]]
