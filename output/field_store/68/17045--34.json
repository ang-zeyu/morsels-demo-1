These birds are very easily tamed, the female, even in  the wild state, being so gentle that she allows herself to be lifted  from the nest. They are also called the _Painted Finch_ or _Painted  Bunting_. They are found in our Southern States and Mexico. They are  very numerous in the State of Louisiana and especially about the City of  New Orleans, where they are greatly admired by the French inhabitants,  who, true to their native instincts, admire anything with gay colors. As  the first name indicates, he has no equal, perhaps, among the songsters  for beauty of dress. On account of this purple hood, he is called by the  French _Le Pape_, meaning The Pope.    The bird makes its appearance in the Southern States the last of April  and, during the breeding season, which lasts until July, two broods are  raised. The nests are made of fine grass and rest in the crotches of  twigs of the low bushes and hedges. The eggs have a dull or pearly-white  ground and are marked with blotches and dots of purplish and reddish  brown.    It is very pleasing to watch the numerous changes which the feathers  undergo before the male bird attains his full beauty of color. The young  birds of both sexes during the first season are of a fine olive green  color on the upper parts and a pale yellow below. The female undergoes  no material change in color except becoming darker as she grows older.  The male, on the contrary, is three seasons in obtaining his full  variety of colors. In the second season the blue begins to show on his  head and the red also makes its appearance in spots on the breast. The  third year he attains his full beauty.    Their favorite resorts are small thickets of low trees and bushes, and  when singing they select the highest branches of the bush. They are  passionately fond of flies and insects and also eat seeds and rice.    Thousands of these birds are trapped for the cage, and sold annually to  our northern people and also in Europe. They are comparatively cheap,  even in our northern bird markets, as most of them are exchanged for our  Canaries and imported birds that cannot be sent directly to the south on  account of climatic conditions.    Many a northern lady, while visiting the orange groves of Florida,  becomes enchanted with the Nonpareil in his wild state, and some shrewd  and wily negro, hearing her expressions of delight, easily procures one,  and disposes of it to her at an extravagant price.          THE AUSTRALIAN GRASS PARRAKEET.      I am a Parrakeet. I belong to the Parrot family. A man bought me and  brought me here.    It is not warm here, as it was where I came from. I almost froze coming  over here.    I am not kept in a cage. I stay in the house and go about as I please.    There is a Pussy Cat in the house. Sometimes I ride on her back. I like  that.    I used to live in the grass lands. It was very warm there. I ran among  the thick grass blades, and sat on the stems and ate seeds.    I had a wife then. Her feathers were almost like mine. We never made  nests. When we wanted a nest, we found a hole in a gum tree. I used to  sing to my wife while she sat on the nest.    I can mock other birds. Sometimes I warble and chirp at the same time.  Then it sounds like two birds singing. My tongue is short and thick, and  this helps me to talk. But I have been talking too much. My tongue is  getting tired.    I think I'll have a ride on Pussy's back. Good bye.           *       *       *    Parrakeets have a great fondness for the grass lands, where they may be  seen in great numbers, running amid the thick grass blades, clinging to  their stems, or feeding on their seeds.    Grass seed is their constant food in their native country. In captivity  they take well to canary seed, and what is remarkable, never pick food  with their feet, as do other species of parrots, but always use their  beaks. \"They do not build a nest, but must be given a piece of wood  with a rough hole in the middle, which they will fill to their liking,  rejecting all soft lining of wool or cotton that you may furnish them.\"    Only the male sings, warbling nearly all day long, pushing his beak at  times into his mate's ear as though to give her the full benefit of his  song. The lady, however, does not seem to appreciate his efforts, but  generally pecks him sharply in return.    A gentleman who brought a Parrakeet from Australia to England, says  it suffered greatly from the cold and change of climate and was kept  alive by a kind-hearted weather-beaten sailor, who kept it warm and  comfortable in his bosom. It was not kept in a cage, but roamed at will  about the room, enjoying greatly at times, a ride on the cat's back. At  meals he perched upon his master's shoulder, picking the bits he liked  from a plate set before him. If the weather was cold or chilly, he would  pull himself up by his master's whiskers and warm his feet by standing  on his bald head. He always announced his master's coming by a shrill  call, and no matter what the hour of night, never failed to utter a note  of welcome, although apparently asleep with his head tucked under his  wing.    [Illustration: AUSTRALIAN GRASS PARRAKEET.]          [Illustration: COCK-OF-THE-ROCK.]    THE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK.      The Cock-of-the-Rock lives in Guiana. Its nest is found among the  rocks. T. K. Salmon says: \"I once went to see the breeding place of the  Cock-of-the-Rock; and a darker or wilder place I have never been in.  Following up a mountain stream the gorge became gradually more enclosed  and more rocky, till I arrived at the mouth of a cave with high rock on  each side, and overshadowed by high trees, into which the sun never  penetrated. All was wet and dark, and the only sound heard was the  rushing of the water over the rocks. We had hardly become accustomed to  the gloom when a nest was found, a dark bird stealing away from what  seemed to be a lump of mud upon the face of the rock. This was a nest  of the Cock-of-the-Rock, containing two eggs; it was built upon a  projecting piece, the body being made of mud or clay, then a few sticks,  and on the top lined with green moss. It was about five feet from the  water. I did not see the male bird, and, indeed, I have rarely ever seen  the male and female birds together, though I have seen both sexes in  separate flocks.\"    The eggs are described as pale buff with various sized spots of shades  from red-brown to pale lilac.    It is a solitary and wary bird, feeding before sunrise and after sunset  and hiding through the day in sombre ravines.    Robert Schomburgh describes its dance as follows:    \"While traversing the mountains of Western Guiana we fell in with a  pack of these splendid birds, which gave me the opportunity of being  an eye witness of their dancing, an accomplishment which I had hitherto  regarded as a fable. We cautiously approached their ballet ground and  place of meeting, which lay some little distance from the road. The  stage, if we may so call it, measured from four to five feet in  diameter; every blade of grass had been removed and the ground was as  smooth as if leveled by human hands. On this space we saw one of the  birds dance and jump about, while the others evidently played the part  of admiring spectators. At one moment it expanded its wings, threw its  head in the air, or spread out its tail like a peacock scratching the  ground with its foot; all this took place with a sort of hopping gait,  until tired, when on emitting a peculiar note, its place was immediately  filled by another performer. In this manner the different birds went  through their terpsichorean exercises, each retiring to its place among  the spectators, who had settled on the low bushes near the theatre of  operations. We counted ten males and two females in the flock. The noise  of a breaking stick unfortunately raised an alarm, when the whole  company of dancers immediately flew off.\"    \"The Indians, who place great value on their skins, eagerly seek out  their playing grounds, and armed with their blow-tubes and poisoned  arrows, lie in wait for the dances. The hunter does not attempt to use  his weapon until the company is quite engrossed in the performance, when  the birds become so preoccupied with their amusement that four or five  are often killed before the survivors detect the danger and decamp.\"          THE RED BIRD OF PARADISE.      My home is on an island where it is very warm. I fly among the tall  trees and eat fruit and insects.    See my beautiful feathers. The ladies like to wear them in their hats.    The feathers of my wife are brown, but she has no long tail feathers.    My wife thinks my plumes are very beautiful.    When we have a party, we go with our wives to a tall tree. We spread our  beautiful plumes while our wives sit and watch us.    Sometimes a man finds our tree and builds a hut among the lower  branches.    He hides in the hut and while we are spreading our feathers shoots at  us.    The arrows are not sharp. They do not draw blood.    When they dry the skins they take off the feet and wings. This is why  people used to think we had neither feet nor wings.    They also thought we lived on the dews of heaven and the honey of  flowers. This is why we are called the Birds of Paradise.           *       *       *        \"Upon its waving feathers poised in air,       Feathers, or rather clouds of golden down,       With streamers thrown luxuriantly out       In all the wantonness of winged wealth.\"    [Illustration: RED BIRD OF PARADISE.]          THE RED BIRD OF PARADISE.      Birds of Paradise are found only in New Guinea and on the neighboring  islands. The species presented here is found only on a few islands.    In former days very singular ideas prevailed concerning these birds  and the most extravagant tales were told of the life they led in their  native lands.

The animals had never been saved  in an overflow; and besides the cruelty of letting them starve by  thousands, the loss to the people was irreparable, as the following year  must inevitably be replete with idleness and poverty till more stock  could be obtained to work with.    We found as commissary at St. Louis, General Beckwith, the historic  commissary-general of the old civil war, who had personally  superintended the loading of my wagons in Washington, year after year,  for the battle-fields of Virginia. He came on board the \"Mattie Bell\"  and personally superintended the lading--clothing, corn, oats, salt, and  hay--besides putting upon the Government boats large quantities of  supplies which we could not take on at first, and giving us his  blessing, watched us steam out on our joint mission; they putting off  rations of meat and meal--we supplementing with clothing for the people  and feed for the stock. We purchased all we could at cities as we  passed, picked our course among the broken levees and roaring crevasses,  all the way to New Orleans. The hungry were fed, the naked clothed, and  the stock saved. The negro had his mule, and the planter his horses and  cattle to carry on his work when the flood should disappear. We had  lighter boats, still lighter purses, but lightest of all were the  grateful hearts that a kind Providence and a generous people had given  to us the privilege of serving.    We discharged the \"Mattie Bell\" at St. Louis, bidding adieu to the  officers of the Red Cross Society, who had rendered most acceptable  service to the cause. They had brought their own funds and material--had  personally administered them from the decks of the \"Mattie Bell,\" made  their own reports, and modestly retired to their home duties, there to  await the next call.    Chicago, which had a new Red Cross Society, formed almost for the  occasion, through its most worthy and notable representative, Rev. E. I.  Galvin, did the same, performing the long journey with us,  superintending the distribution of his own relief and making his own  report with such convincing power, that societies of no less excellence  than the Lend-a-Hand were its outgrowth.    I am thus particular to mention this from the loving gratitude  fervently cherished for strong, tender help in the day of small things.  Their contributions largely served to run our boat and keep our crew,  and with heads, hearts, and hands we struggled as one, to avert the  destruction so rife around us.    From St. Louis we crossed over to Evansville, rechartered the \"John V.  Troop,\" and put on accumulated supplies. The waters of the Ohio had  subsided and the people were returning to the old spots of earth that  once had been their home, but there was neither house to live in nor  tool to work the land with. We reloaded with pine lumber, ready-made  doors, windows, household utensils, stores and groceries, farming  utensils, and with a good force of carpenters proceeded up the Ohio once  more. The sight of the disconsolate, half-clad farmer waiting on the  bank told us where his home had been--and was not.    Three hours' work of our carpenters would put up a one-room house,  meanwhile our efficient men and women helpers, among them the best  ladies of Evansville, would furnish it with beds, bedding, clothing,  provisions for the family, and farming tools ready to go on with the  season's work.    Picture, if possible, this scene. A strange ship with a strange flag  steaming up the river. It halts, turns from its course, and draws up to  the nearest landing. Some persons disembark and speak a few minutes with  the family. Then, a half dozen strong mechanics man a small boat laden  with all material for constructing a one-room house--floor, roof, doors,  windows. The boat returns for furniture. Within three hours the strange  ship sails away, leaving a bewildered family in a new and clean house  with bed, bedding, clothing, table, chairs, dishes, candles, a little  cooking-stove with a blazing fire, all the common quota of cooking  utensils, and meat, meal, and groceries; a plow, rake, axe, hoe, shovel,  spade, hammer, and nails. We ask few questions. They ask none. The  whistle of the \"Troop\" is as welcome to their ears as the flag to their  eyes.    At one of these wrecked villages the entire little hamlet of people  stood on our decks. Only four, they said, were left at home, and these  were sick. They had selected their lawyer to speak their thanks. No  words will ever do justice to the volume of native eloquence which  seemed to roll unbidden from his lips. He finished with these sentences:    \"At noon on that day we were in the blackness of despair--the whole  village in the power of the demon of waters--hemmed in by sleet and ice,  without fire enough to cook its little food. When the bell struck nine  that night, there were seventy-five families on their knees before their  blazing grates, thanking God for fire and light, and praying blessings  on the phantom ship with the unknown device that had come as silently as  the snow, they knew not whence, and gone, they knew not whither.\"    When we finished the voyage of relief, we had covered the Ohio River  from Cincinnati to Cairo and back twice, and the Mississippi from St.  Louis to New Orleans, and return--four months on the rivers--traveled  over eight thousand miles, distributed in relief of money and estimated  material, one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars--gathered as we  used it.    We left at one point on the Ohio River a well-lettered cross-board,  \"Little Six Red Cross Landing\"--probably there to this day. The story of  The Little Six might be given in their own little letter:      WATERFORD, PA., _March_ 24, 1884.    DEAR MISS BARTON:    We read your nice letter in the Dispatch and we would like very much to  see that house called \"The Little Six,\" and we little six are so glad  that we helped six other little children, and we thank you for going to  so much trouble in putting our money just where we would have put it  ourselves. Some time again when you want money to help you in your good  work call on \"The Little Six.\"      JOE FARRAR, twelve years old.  FLORENCE HOWE, eleven years old.  MARY BARTON, eleven years old.  REED WHITE, eleven years old.  BERTIE AINSWORTH, ten years old.  LOYD BARTON, seven years old.      These children had given a public entertainment for the benefit of the  flood sufferers. They themselves suggested it, planned and carried it  out, and raised fifty-one dollars and twenty-five cents, which they  sent to the editor of the Eric Dispatch, asking him to send it \"where it  would do the most good.\" The Dispatch forwarded it to the president of  the Red Cross, with an account of the entertainment given by \"The Little  Six.\"    The entire matter was too beautiful and withal unique, to meet only a  common fate in its results. I could not, for a moment, think to mingle  the gift of the little dramatists with the common fund for general  distribution, and sought through all these weeks for a fitting  disposition to make of it, where it would all go in some special manner  to relieve some special necessity. I wanted it to benefit some children  who had \"wept on the banks\" of the river, which in its madness had  devoured their home.    As we neared that picturesque spot on the Illinois side of the Ohio,  known as \"Cave-in Rock,\" we were hailed by a woman and her young  daughter. The boat \"rounded to\" and made the landing and they came on  board--a tall, thin, worn woman in tattered clothes, with a good but  inexpressibly sad face, who wished to tell us that a package which we  had left for her at the town on our way down had never reached her. She  was a widow--Mrs. Plew--whose husband, a good river pilot, had died from  overwork on a hard trip to New Orleans in the floods of the Mississippi  two years before, leaving her with six children dependent upon her, the  eldest a lad in his \"teens,\" the youngest a little baby girl. They owned  their home, just on the brink of the river, a little \"farm\" of two or  three acres, two horses, three cows, thirty hogs, and a half hundred  fowls, and in spite of the bereavement, they had gone on bravely,  winning the esteem and commendation of all who knew them for thrift and  honest endeavor. Last year the floods came heavily upon them, driving  them from their home, and the two horses were lost. Next the cholera  came among the hogs and all but three died. Still they worked on; and  held the home. This spring came the third flood. The water climbed up  the bank, crept in at the door, and filled the lower story of the house.  They had nowhere to remove their household goods, and stored them in the  garret carefully packed, and went out to find a shelter in an old log  house near by, used for a corn-crib. Day by day they watched the house,  hailed passing boats for news of the rise and fall of the water above,  always trusting the house would stand--\"and it would,\" the mother said,  \"for it was a good, strong house, but for the storm.\" The winds came,  and the terrible gale that swept the valley like a tornado, with the  water at its height, leveling whole towns, descended and beat upon that  house, and it fell. In the morning there was no house there, and the  waves in their fury rushed madly on. Then these little children \"stood  and wept on the banks of the river,\" and the desolation and fear in the  careful mother's heart, none but herself and her God can know.    They lived on in the corn-crib, and it was from it they came to hail us  as we passed to-day. Something had been told us of them on our downward  trip, and a package had been left them at \"Cave-in Rock,\" which they had  not received. We went over shoe-tops in mud to their rude home, to find  it one room of logs, an old stone chimney, with a cheerful fire of  drift-wood and a _clean_ hearth, two wrecks of beds, a"]]]
