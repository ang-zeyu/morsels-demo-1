Brown, Black, Chocolate, and Dark Red are complicated  mixtures and may be analyzed with a chart which will appear later. Many  of these dark colors would harmonize with one another, but would  be so dark that they would not be pleasing. In every one of these  combinations, the natural straw background figures as another color,  and that is why the especially good combinations, as will be noticed,  contain browns, yellows and reds, colors which blend particularly  well with the background. Red-Violet No. 7 can be used with only a  very few colors, and never with Yellow Yellow-Orange No. 1. Yellow  Yellow-Orange should be used cautiously.    In sabutan straw, No. 1, Yellow, must be used sparingly. When used  in combinations in place of No. 1, Yellow Yellow-Orange, the design  should be an open one, rather than solid. Violet Red-Red, No. 16,  when being used in place of Red, No. 10, must be used in the same way,  and only in places where very, very little is called for. No. 11 is  a color that clashes with even a natural straw, so is not advisable  in any combination or alone. No. 13 is not a necessary color when  No. 2 and No. 6 are available.    In placing the color upon the space to be decorated, the heavier colors  should usually appear on the outside and near the edge of the space,  although a border may sometimes be outlined with darker color on both  inside and outside edges.    The following combinations of these colored straws will prove  harmonious. The numbers correspond to those used on the chart and  the different kinds of type indicate the proportions of the color to  be used--little, Medium Amount, MUCH. The relative positions of the  colors must also be observed and the given order followed when more  than two colors are combined.    Brown (3) Yellow-Yellow Orange (1). Especially good.    Black (8) Yellow-Yellow Orange (1).    Chocolate (9) Yellow-yellow Orange (1).    RED-ORANGE (14) CHOCOLATE (9) Yellow-Yellow Orange(1). In this case,  the heavy color, 9, comes in the center of the design, but is necessary  to separate Nos. 14 and 1.    VIOLET (2) BLUE-GREEN (12) Red-Orange (14).

In Romblon buri straw the following combinations will be harmonious:    Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with Rule 4. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in  accordance with Rule 4.    Exception to Rule 2: No. 5 is inharmonious with No. 4.    It will be noticed that these colors depend for their harmony on their  order or sequence and their quantity (in this case equal parts of all  three). No. 3 being a neutral color, great quantities of it may be used  with any other colors. There is danger, however, in getting too much of  one of the other two colors. No. 4 is a very strong color and a little  will be pleasing while much will be offensive. It is not well to use  it alone on a ground of No. 3. No. 5 may be used alone with a ground  of No. 3; No. 1 with a ground of No. 3; No. 2 with a ground of No. 3;  No. 3 with a ground of No. 2; Nos. 1 and 3 on a ground of No. 2, with  a very small quantity of No. 1; equal proportions of Nos. 1 and 4 may  be combined on a ground of No. 3; Nos. 2 and 4 on a ground of No. 3,  a very small quantity of No. 4 being used.

It will be necessary to use No. 3 on a ground work. Mats made entirely  of any of the other colors would hardly be harmonious on a floor or  wall, if there were any other furnishings. Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 may be  used separately upon a ground of No. 3; No. 2 in large quantity; No. 1  in small ground of No. 3; No. 2 in equal quantity with No. 5 upon a  ground of No. 3; No. 5 in equal quantity with No. 6 upon a ground  of No. 3; No. 6 in large quantity, with No. 2 in small quantity,  upon a ground of No. 3; No. 5 in large quantity, with No. 1 small,  on a ground of No. 3.            STRIPPING MAT STRAWS.      Philippine mat straws can be divided into three classes--palm  straws, pandan straws, and straws obtained from sedges. The first  two are obtained by stripping the leaves of the plants into narrow  lengths. For this purpose there is used in most localities a small  gauge held between the thumb and index fingers. A knife blade fitting  in the notches serves as the cutting edge. The leaf is held in one  hand and the gauge and knife in the other, the edge of the leaf  being drawn through the gauge. This is generally made out of the  stiff part of the leaf, though, occasionally, of a piece of rattan,  bamboo or leather. At best it serves for only a few hours of use,  when it is thrown away and another made.    When the notch becomes worn, the blade moves about in the gauge,  causing the width of the straws to vary, and when a new gauge is  made there is always more or less variance in the position of the new  notches. This method is very slow, as but one strip can be cut at a  time; and, until the operator becomes expert in the use of the gauge,  many of the strips are worthless. When used in the school room, each  pupil has to prepare his own material. This causes waste of materials  and a constant littering of the floor.    For stripping sabutan leaves, the mat weavers of Tanay, Rizal, use  a kind of comb which is discussed under the heading \"Sabutan.\" The  leaves are pulled over this comb before being dried. As sabutan is  parallel veined it is very easy to strip it thus, the teeth of the  comb following the leaf fibers. The comb produces several uniform  straws with one stroke.    The object of contriving the stripping machine illustrated and  described here was to furnish a quick means of preparing palm and  pandan straws with uniform widths and clean cut edges. Forms of it  have been in use for some time and the model noted here has been tried  out for a year. By its use one pupil can prepare materials for the  whole class, or else the teacher can have all the materials prepared  beforehand if it is so desired. This is half the problem of teaching  the weaving of hats or mats.    This stripper is made wide enough for inserting teeth three widths  apart, so that without adjusting these teeth three widths of straw  may be cut. By changing the teeth in the adjustable gums, any width  desired may be obtained.    It is best to make this apparatus of hard wood, especially the piece  represented by Fig. A. A is a block of wood 23 cm. by 4 cm. by 4 cm.,  containing the groove XY. This groove is the size and shape of C,  being 2.5 cm. wide at the top, 1.5 cm. at the bottom, and 3 cm. high. C  is one of the blocks which slides in the groove XY. These blocks are  made of different thicknesses, about 2, 3, and 4 mm., and are of hard  wood or metal. The rod B passes through these blocks and tightens  on the block D or X by means of a thumb screw. Z is a wooden roller  19 cm. long and 1.5 cm. in diameter. This should extend 2 mm. below  the level of the main surface. It is placed in a groove made in a  separate piece of wood from the principal block and is fastened into  the principal block by means of screws.    The teeth (see C) are made of clock springs or other thin sharp  metal. They are 3 cm. long and 1 cm. to 1 1/2 cm. wide. The two  upright pieces at both ends contain grooves on the inside in which  the block-head slides up and down.    To operate this device, the block-head containing the teeth is  raised by the handle; the leaf is placed under the teeth, and the  block-head is dropped. The teeth pass through the leaf into a groove  underneath. The leaf is now pulled through by the hand as illustrated  in Plate VI.          KINDS OF WEAVES.      With respect to their weaving, Philippine mats divide themselves into  six groups and are here arranged according to their difficulty. They  are (1) the over and under weave found in most simple mats, such  as those made of buri straws, pandan straws, and sedges; (2) the  sawali weaves, which employ the floating straws for making \"woven in\"  designs and panels for figured sabutan and tikug mats; (3) the open  work weaves of the Romblon buri mats; (4) the circular mats which  employ the hat weaves, either with or without \"woven in\" designs;  (5) the hexagonal weave; and (6) the embroidered mats in which the  designs are later added. In difficulty, and in place in a course of  instruction, embroidered mats follow the simple over and under weave.        Over-and-Under Weave.    This weave "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#3)"],[1,"thyroid cartilages  the _points d'appui_, the arytenoids the pegs, and lastly, the muscles  inserted in them the power which tensed or relaxed the cords.\"    It must be admitted that the human voice bears more resemblance to a  reed instrument than to any other; but when the comparison is pushed to  its legitimate consequences it is found to break down. We cannot resist  the conclusion that the vocal organ is infinitely superior to any  instrument made by human hands. Its mechanism is so wonderful as to  excite the profoundest admiration, and the more we continue to study it  the more we marvel at the wisdom of the Divine Maker who planned it. I  shall, therefore, speak of it simply as a wind instrument composed of--         1.--THE BELLOWS.         Represented by the LUNGS. Pl. I (Frontispiece), L.         2.--THE WINDPIPE. Pl.

WINDPIPE (TRACHEA).  ]    The Lungs are enclosed in the chest, which they fit exactly, and of  which they occupy by far the largest portion, leaving but a small space  for the heart. They consist of two halves (pl. II, R, L), each roughly  resembling the upper part of a sugar-loaf somewhat flattened and  hollowed out at the bottom. The left shows two and the right three  distinct flaps or lobes. They are only connected by means of the  windpipe (pl. II, W) and its branches.    =The Chest= (pl. III) is an air-tight chamber, which is narrower above  than below. It is formed by the spine at the back, twelve ribs (pl. III,  1 to 11, the twelfth not visible on the drawing), with their inner and  outer muscles on either side, the breast-bone (pl. III, B B) in front,  the root of the neck at the top, and the midriff or diaphragm (pl. I, M)  at the bottom.    =The Midriff= (pl. III, M) is a muscular and movable partition by which  the lungs are separated from the abdomen. It is arched upwards like an  inverted basin, but when its muscular fibres contract it flattens and  descends, thus increasing the capacity of the chest at the expense of  that of the abdomen.    =The Function of the Lungs= is, as everybody knows, respiration, which may  be considered from a mechanical or a chemical point of view. In this  little work we are only concerned with the mechanical part of the  subject. If we examine the lungs of a calf, which are very similar to  those of a human being, we find that they are soft and elastic to the  touch, giving out when pressed a peculiar whizzing sound. We may  increase their volume by blowing into them through the windpipe, so as  to make them double their original size, and then tie up the windpipe.  On re-opening the windpipe the air escapes, and the lungs are gradually  reduced to their former bulk. Now, by drawing a deep breath we produce  the same result in ourselves as by blowing into the lungs of the calf;  by holding the breath we produce the same result as by tying up the  windpipe--that is to say, we keep the lungs in a state of expansion; and  by releasing the breath we are, as it were, untying the windpipe,  leaving the lungs to dwindle down gradually to their former size.    There is one very material point, however, in which the analogy ceases.  It is this: we keep the air in the inflated calf's lungs by tying up the  windpipe, and the corresponding act in ourselves would be to hold our  breath by muscular contraction of the outlet in the throat. This is  precisely what we do in straining, and in lifting heavy weights, &c.;  but it should _never_ be done in breathing for vocal purposes. Here it  must, on the contrary, be our endeavour to train, to the highest  possible degree, the powerful muscles of the chest and of the abdomen,  instead of throwing the labour intended for them upon the comparatively  weak and delicate muscles governing the outlet of the windpipe.    To make the way in which respiration is carried on clearer still, I  quote the following interesting and lucid account from Huxley's  \"Elementary Physiology,\" fourth edition, p. 104. He compares the  breathing apparatus to \"a sort of bellows without a valve,\" in which  the chest and the lungs represent the body of the bellows, while the  windpipe is the pipe; \"and the effect of the respiratory movement is  just the same as that of the approximation and separation of the handles  of the bellows, which drive out and draw in the air through the pipe.  There is, however, one difference between the bellows and the  respiratory apparatus, of great importance in the theory of respiration,  though frequently overlooked, and that is, that the sides of the bellows  can be brought close together so as to force out all, or nearly all, the  air which they contain, while the walls of the chest, when approximated  as much as possible, still enclose a very considerable cavity; so that  even after the most violent expiratory effort, a very large quantity of  air is left in the lungs.\"    =Respiration=, consequently, consists of two acts--namely, inspiration and  expiration. Inspiration may be produced in three different ways--(1) By  pushing the chest forward and flattening the midriff, so as to compel  the lungs to _descend_ and to increase in volume in order to fill the  empty space created by this movement; (2) by extending the ribs  _sideways_; and (3) by _drawing up_ the upper parts of the  chest--namely, the collar bones (pl. III, C C) and the shoulder blades.  In scientific works the first is called diaphragmatic or abdominal,[B]  the second lateral or costal, and the third clavicular or scapular  breathing. As, however, these terms convey no meaning to the general  reader, I prefer to speak of--(1) Midriff Breathing; (2) Rib Breathing;  (3) Collar-bone Breathing. In taking a full, deep inspiration, midriff  breathing and rib breathing take place almost together and assist each  other--that is to say, the midriff contracts and flattens, and  immediately afterwards the ribs extend sideways; with this difference,  however, that in men the action of the midriff takes a larger share in  the work than the ribs, while in woman, on the contrary, the movement of  the ribs is greater than that of the midriff.         By way of illustrating this curious difference of breathing in men       and women, the following anecdote, which has the recommendation of       being strictly true, may perhaps amuse the reader. Some time ago a       troupe of \"Female Minstrels,\" calling themselves, I believe, \"The       American Amazons,\" made a tour through this country. Their faces       were blackened in the orthodox fashion, and they were in male       attire, wearing tight-fitting garments of a peculiar kind. Two       friends, both medical men, went to hear them (or perhaps to see       them, I am not sure which), when Mr. A remarked that two of the       performers were men. Mr. B did not see it, even when the       individuals were pointed out to him, and asked his friend for the       reasons for his opinion. \"Why,\" said Mr. A, \"I see it by their       abdominal breathing!\" And sure enough Mr. B now saw it too, and       there was no mistake about it; for in the two suspected       individuals the abdomen was evidently moving in respiration, while       in all the others no movement was perceptible excepting that of       their chests.    [Illustration: PLATE IV.    DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE VARYING CAPACITY OF THE CHEST, ACCORDING TO  THE METHOD IN WHICH THE LUNG IS INFLATED.    From Mr. Lennox Browne's \"Medical Hints on the Production and  Management of the Singing Voice,\" by permission of Messrs Chappell  and Co.    The front outline A of the shaded figure represents the chest after  full expiration; the black continuous line A gives the increase in  size of the chest, and the descent of the diaphragm, indicated by  the curved transverse lines, in full abdominal respiration. The  dotted line C shows the retraction of the diaphragm and of the  abdominal muscles in forced clavicular inspiration. The varying  thickness of the line B indicates the fact of healthy breathing in  a man being more abdominal than in woman. The outlines of forced  inspiration in both sexes are remarkably similar.  ]    The combined forms of midriff and rib breathing are the right method of  inspiration, while collar-bone breathing is absolutely wrong, and should  never be made use of. The reasons of this are not far to seek. The lower  part of each lung is large and broad, while the upper part is  cone-shaped, and very much smaller. It is self-evident, therefore, that  by downward and sideways expansion (enlarging the _lower_ part of the  lungs) you will inhale a much greater quantity of air than by drawing up  the collar-bones. This consideration alone should suffice to prove the  utter falseness of collar-bone breathing. Collar-bone breathing has also  the additional disadvantage of causing much fatigue, because all the  parts surrounding the upper region of the lungs are hard and unyielding,  so that a great amount of resistance has to be overcome (the \"_lutte  vocale_\" of French authors), while the very opposite is the case with  the lower part of the lungs.    Mr. Lennox Browne, who was, I believe, the first to direct the attention  of English readers to this matter, says,[C] \"Clavicular [collar-bone]  breathing is a method of respiration totally vicious, and to be avoided.
