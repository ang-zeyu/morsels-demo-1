If an individual is led to reproduce often the same series of actions  it contracts a _habit_; the repetition may be so frequent that the  animal comes to accomplish it without knowing it; the brain no longer  intervenes; the spinal cord or the chain of ganglia alone govern this  order of acts, to which has been given the name of _reflex actions_. A  reflex may be so powerful as to be transmitted by heredity to the  descendants; it then becomes an _instinct_.    Thus by its nature instinct does not differ from intelligence, but is  intimately connected with it by a chain of which all the links may be  counted. The most intelligent of beings, Man, performs actions that  are purely mechanical; many indeed can with justice be called  instinctive; and, on the other hand, an animal for whom an innate  hereditary instinct is sufficient in ordinary life will give proof of  intelligence and reflection if circumstances in which his instinct is  generally efficacious become modified so that he can no longer profit  by them. Among other ingenious experiments to show the supposed  difference between instinctive and reflective acts, Fabre brings  forward the following[5]:--The _Chalicodoma_, a hymenopterous relative  of the Bees, constructs nests composed of cells formed of mud  agglutinated with saliva. The cell once constructed, the insect begins  to fill it with honey before laying an egg there. He returns with his  booty and wishes to disburse himself in the nest, finds the cellule  which he has to fill, and proceeds always in the same order: first, he  plunges his head in the cell and disgorges the honey which fills his  crop; secondly, he emerges from the cell, turns round, and lets fall  the pollen which remains attached to his legs. Suppose that an insect  has just disgorged his honey, the observer touches his belly with a  straw; the little animal, disturbed in his operation, returns to it  having only the second act to perform. But he re-commences the whole  of his operations though having nothing more to disgorge; he again  plunges his head into the cell and goes through a pretence of  disgorging, then turns round and frees himself from the pollen.  Although touched twice, thrice, or more frequently, he always repeats  the first action before executing the second. It is, says Fabre,  almost like the movement of a machine of which the wheelwork will not  act until one has begun to turn the wheel which directs it.        [5] J. H. Fabre, _Souvenirs entomologiques_, Paris, 1879,          pp. 275 _et seq._    It is incontestable; but I would add, as this conscientious observer  does not, that that does not prove that the intelligence of the insect  differs essentially from ours; it is a simple question of degree. Look  at a boy who is going to jump over a ditch: he begins by spitting into  his hands and rubbing them one against the other before taking his  spring. In what has this served him? It is not more intelligent than  the gesture of the bee who first plunges his head in the cell before  freeing his claws, although the first gesture is useless.[6]        [6] It should perhaps be added that while the boy's action          is not consciously intelligent, it is by no means          purposeless, and is therefore not quite parallel with the          insect's. By vigorously irritating the sensory nerves of the          hand the boy imparts a stimulus to his muscular system. His          act belongs to a large group which has been especially          studied by Fere. See his _Sensation et Mouvement_ (1887),          and _Pathologie des Emotions_ (1892).    And, from another side, if nothing is more instinctive than the manner  in which domestic Bees construct their cells of wax with geometric  regularity, there are other circumstances in which these same insects  give proof of remarkable reflection, sagacity, and intelligence in  co-ordinating their actions in the presence of an event to which they  are not accustomed, and in attaining an end which has presented itself  by accident. Such are, for example, the arrangements which they make  to defend their honey against the attacks of a great nocturnal Moth,  the Death's Head. I shall have to revert to these facts.    We must not then regard instinct, as has often been done, as a  rudiment of intelligence, susceptible or not of development; but much  rather as a series of intelligent acts at first reasoned, then by  their frequent repetition become habitual, reflex, and at last, by  heredity, instinctive.    What the individual loses in individuality and in personal initiative,  heredity restores to him in the form of instinct which is, as it were,  the condensed and accumulated intelligence of his ancestors. He  himself no longer needs to take thought either to preserve his life or  to assure the perpetuation of his race. The qualities which he  received at birth render reflection less necessary; thus species  endowed with some powerful instinct seem not to be intelligent when  they live sheltered from unforeseen events.    From one point of view instinct appears to be a degradation rather  than a perfecting of intelligence, because the acts which proceed from  it are neither so spontaneous nor so personal; but from another point  of view they are much better executed, with less hesitation, with a  slighter expenditure of cerebral force and a minimum of muscular  effort. A habitual act costs us much less to execute than a deliberate  and reflective act. It is thus that the constructions of bees are more  perfect than those of ants; the former act by instinct, the latter  reason their acts at each step.    _Instinctive actions originate in reflective actions._--No doubt it  may be said: It is a pure hypothesis thus to consider instinct as  derived from intelligence; why not admit as well that instinctive acts  have been such from the beginning--in other words, that species have  been created such as we see them to-day? The preceding explanation,  however, has the advantage of being in harmony with the general theory  of evolution, which, whether true or not, so well explains the most  complicated facts that for the present it must be accepted. For the  rest, if it is not possible to appraise the psychic faculties  possessed by the ancestors of existing animals we may at least observe  certain facts which put us on the road of explanation.    An interesting member of the Hymenoptera, the _Sphex_, assures food  for the early days of the life of its larvae in a curious way.[7]  Before laying its eggs it seizes a cricket, paralyses it with two  strokes of its sting--one at the articulation of the head and the  neck, the other at the articulation of the first ring of the thorax  with the second--each stab traversing and poisoning a nervous  ganglion. The cricket is paralysed without being killed; its flesh  does not putrefy, and yet it makes no movement. The _Sphex_ places an  egg on this motionless prey, and the larva which emerges from it  devours the cricket. Here assuredly is a marvellous and certain  instinct. One cannot even object that the strokes of the sting are  inevitably directed to these points because the chitinous envelope of  the victim offers too much resistance in other spots for the dart to  penetrate, because here is the _Ammophila_, a near relative of the  _Sphex_, which chooses for its prey a caterpillar. It is free to  introduce its sting into any part of the body, and yet with extreme  certainty it strikes the two ganglions already mentioned.[8]        [7] \"Etude sur l'Instinct et les Metamorphoses des          Sphegiens,\" _Ann. Sc. Nat._, iv. Serie, t. 6, 1856.        [8] P. Marchal, \"Observations sur _l'Ammophila affinis_,\"          _Arch. de Zool. exper. et gener._, ii. Serie, t. 10, 1892.    We cannot suppose that the insect has anatomical and physiological  knowledge to inform it of what it is doing. The act is distinctly  instinctive, and seems imprinted by a fatality involving no possible  connection with intelligence. But let us suppose that the ancestors of  these Hymenoptera have thus attacked crickets and killed (not  paralysed) them with one or more wounds at any point. By chance some  of these insects, either in consequence of their manner of attacking  the prey or from any other cause, happen to deliver their blows at the  points in question. Their larvae on this account are placed in more  favourable conditions than those of their relatives whom chance has  less well served; they will prosper and develop sooner. They inherit  this habit, which gradually becomes through the ages that which we  know. It is possible; but why, it may be asked, this hypothesis,  apparently gratuitous, of strokes of the sting given at random? Are  there any facts which render this explanation plausible? Assuredly.  Thus the _Bembex_, which especially attacks Diptera to make them the  prey of its larvae, throws itself suddenly on them and kills them with  one blow in any part of the body. It is unable in this way to amass in  advance sufficient provision for its larvae; the corpses would putrefy.  It is obliged to return from time to time bearing new pasture.[9]  Again, M. Paul Marchal, taking up the study of instinct in the  _Cerceris ornata_,[10] has shown that in this species at least of  _Sphegidae_ the stings have not so considerable an effect. This insect  attacks a wild bee, the _Halictus_. He strikes his victim with two or  three strokes of the sting beneath the thorax, but the paralysis is  not definite,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#3)"],[1,"ment. He dived again  immediately; and just as he did so the head of a huge beaver poked up  and snatched a breath. Where the two had gone under, the surface of  the pond now fairly boiled; and the Boy, in his excitement over this  novel and mysterious contest, nearly lost his balance on the frail  crest of the dam. A few moments more and both adversaries again came  to the surface, now at close grips and fighting furiously. They were  followed almost at once by a second beaver, smaller than the first,  who fell upon the otter with insane fury. It was plain that the  beavers were the aggressors. The Boy's sympathies were all with the  otter, who from time to time tried vainly to escape from the battle;  and once he raised his rifle. But he bethought him that the otter,  after all, whatever his intentions, was a trespasser; and that the  beavers had surely a right to police their own pond. He remembered an  old Indian's having told him that there was always a blood feud  between the beaver and the otter; and how was he to know how just the  cause of offence, or the stake at issue? Lowering his gun he stared in  breathless eagerness.    The otter, however, as it proved, was well able to take care of  himself. Suddenly rearing his sleek, snaky body half out of the water,  he flashed down upon the smaller beaver and caught it firmly behind  the ear with his long, deadly teeth--teeth designed to hold the  convulsive and slippery writhings of the largest salmon. With mad  contortions the beaver struggled to break that fatal grip. But the  otter held inexorably, shaking its victim as a terrier does a rat, and  paid no heed whatever to the slashing assaults of the other beaver.  The water was lashed to such a turmoil that the waves spread all over  the pond, washing up to the Boy's feet on the crest of the dam, and  swaying the bronze-green grasses about the house on the little island.  Though, without a doubt, all the other citizens of the pond were  watching the battle even more intently than himself, the Boy could not  catch sight of so much as nose or ear. The rest of the spectators kept  close to the covert of grass tuft and lily pad.    [Illustration: \"SUDDENLY REARING HIS SLEEK, SNAKY BODY HALF OUT OF THE  WATER.\"]    All at once the small beaver stiffened itself out convulsively on top  of the water, turned belly up, and began to sink. At the same time the  otter let go, tore free of his second and more dangerous adversary,  and swam desperately for the nearest point of shore. The surviving  beaver, evidently hurt, made no effort to follow up his victory, but  paddled slowly to the house on the island, where he disappeared.  Presently the otter gained the shore and dragged himself up. His  glossy brown skin was gashed and streaming with blood, but the Boy  gathered that his wounds were not mortal. He turned, stared fixedly at  the beaver-house for several seconds as if unwilling to give in, then  stole off through the trees to seek some more hospitable water. As he  vanished, repulsed and maltreated, the Boy realized for the first time  how hostile even the unsophisticated wilderness is to a stranger.  Among the wild kindreds, even as among men, most things worth having  are preempted.    When the Boy's excitement over this strange fight had calmed down, he  set himself with keen interest to examining the dam. He knew that by  this time every beaver in the pond was aware of his presence, and  would take good care to keep out of sight; so there was no longer  anything to be gained by concealment. Pacing the crest, he made it to  be about one hundred feet in length. At the centre, and through a  great part of its length, it was a little over three feet high, its  ends diminishing gradually into the natural rise of the shores. The  base of the dam, as far as he could judge, seemed to be about twelve  feet in thickness, its upper face constructed with a much more gradual  slope than the lower. The whole structure, which was built of poles,  brush, stones, and earth, appeared to be very substantial, a most  sound and enduring piece of workmanship. But along the crest, which  was not more than a foot and a half in width, it was built with a  certain looseness and elasticity for which he was at a loss to  account. Presently he observed, however, that this dam had no place of  overflow for letting off the water. The water stood in the pond at a  height that brought it within three or four inches of the crest. At  this level he saw that it was escaping, without violence, by  percolating through the toughly but loosely woven tissue of sticks and  twigs. The force of the overflow was thus spread out so thin that its  destructive effect on the dam was almost nothing. It went filtering,  with little trickling noises, down over and through the whole lower  face of the structure, there to gather again into a brook and resume  its sparkling journey toward the sea.    The long upper slope of the dam was smoothly and thoroughly faced with  clay, so that none of its framework showed through, save here and  there the butt of a sapling perhaps three or four inches in diameter,  which proclaimed the solidity of the foundations. The lower face, on  the other hand, was all an inexplicable interlacing of sticks and  poles which seemed at first glance heaped together at haphazard. On  examination, however, the Boy found that every piece was woven in so  firmly among its fellows that it took some effort to remove it. The  more he studied the structure, the more his admiration grew, and his  appreciation of the reasoning intelligence of its builders; and he  smiled to himself a little controversial smile, as he thought how  inadequate what men call instinct would be to such a piece of work as  this.    But what impressed him most, as a mark of engineering skill and sound  calculation on the part of the pond-people, was the direction in which  the dam was laid. At either end, where the water was shoal, and  comparatively dead even in time of freshet, the dam ran straight,  taking the shortest way. But where it crossed the main channel of the  brook, and required the greatest strength, it had a pronounced upward  curve to help it resist the thrust of the current. He contemplated  this strong curve for some time; then, a glance at the sun reminding  him that it was near noon, he took off his cap to the low-domed house  in the water and made haste back to camp for dinner.          CHAPTER III    In the Under-water World      MEANWHILE, in the dark chamber and the long, dim corridors of the  House in the Water there was great perturbation. The battle with the  otter had been a tremendous episode in their industrious, well-ordered  lives, and they were wildly excited over it. But much more important  to them--to all but the big beaver who was now nursing his triumphant  wounds--was the presence of Man in their solitude. Man had hitherto  been but a tradition among them, a vague but alarming tradition. And  now his appearance, yesterday and to-day, filled them with terror.  That vision of the Boy, standing tall and ominous on the dam, and  afterwards going forward and backward over it, pulling at it,  apparently seeking to destroy it, seemed to portend mysterious  disasters. After he was gone, and well gone, almost every beaver in  the pond, not only from the main house but also from the lodge over  on the bank, swam down and made a flurried inspection of the dam,  without showing his head above water, to see if the structure on which  they all depended had been tampered with. One by one, each on his own  responsibility, they swam down and inspected the water-face; and one  by one they swam back, more or less relieved in their minds.    All, of course, except the big beaver who had been in the fight. If it  had not been for that vision of the Boy, he would have crept out upon  the dry grass of the little island and there licked and comforted his  wounds in the comforting sunlight. Now, however, he dared not allow  himself that luxury. His strong love of cleanliness made him reluctant  to take his bleeding gashes into the house; but there was nothing else  to be done. He was the head of the household, however, so there was  none to gainsay him. He dived into the mouth of the shorter of the two  entrances, mounted the crooked and somewhat steep passage, and curled  himself upon the dry grass in one corner of the dark, secluded  chamber. His hurts were painful, and ugly, but none of them deadly,  and he knew he would soon be all right again. There was none of that  foreknowledge of death upon him which sometimes drives a sick animal  to abdicate his rights and crawl away by himself for the last great  contest.    The room wherein the big beaver lay down to recover himself was not  spacious nor particularly well ventilated, but in every other respect  it was very admirably adapted to the needs of its occupants. Through  the somewhat porous ceiling, a three-foot thickness of turf and  sticks, came a little air, but no light. This, however, did not matter  to the beavers, whose ears and noses were of more significance to them  than their eyes. In floor area the chamber was something like five  feet by six and a half, but in height not much more than eighteen  inches. The floor of this snug retreat was not five inches above the  level of the water in the passages leading in to it; but so  excellently was it constructed as to be altogether free from damp. It  was daintily clean, moreover; and the beds of dry grass around the  edges of the chamber were clean and fresh.    From this room the living, sleeping, and dining room of the beaver  family, ran two passageways communicating with the outside world. Both  of these were roofed over to a point well outside the walls of the  house, and had their opening in the bottom of the pond, where the  water was considerably more than three feet in depth. One of these  passages was perfectly straight, about two"]]]
