Here they were associated with pupae  of _Tipula angustipennis_ Lw., larvae of _Sciara_ (Mycetophilidae);  _Psilocephala haemorrhoidalis_ Macq. (Therevidae), numerous beetle larvae,  centipedes, etc. By their elongate form and glabrous shiny skin they  are very characteristic and easily recognized. The glassy appearance of  the body suggests the shiny shells of a small coiled molluscan whose  dead fragments occurred in some numbers in the same situations. These  larvae were placed in rearing and the first adults appeared in the  breeding-cages on May 6, and from that time on continued to appear in  large numbers. It was over a month later that the first individuals  were taken in the field. The pupal duration could not be determined  closer than ten days, and this may be the usual length of time required  for this stage. The first larvae of _D. minima_ were found on July 2,  1918, in similar situations in North Hollow. At this time they were  only about one-half grown. On July 11 much larger larvae of this species  were secured and placed in rearing, emerging as adults on July 21. The  larvae, like these of _D. winnemana_, live just beneath the layer of  leaf-mold in the upper zone of black soil. They are usually quite  sluggish in their motions but at other times are quite active. The  larvae are herbivores and feed on the rich organic earth in their  haunts. When ready to pupate, they encase themselves in earthen cells  (10 mm. x 3.5 mm.), firm in texture, rather thick-walled but without  silk. There is a small opening at either end. The length of the cavity  is but little greater than the pupa itself. In this cavity the pupa  rests and matures. As in other insects, the teneral pupae are very pale  yellow but gradually darken in color until, at emergence, they are of a  dark brownish-black. When newly transformed the teneral flies rest on  the ground and on the leaves of low plants nearby.    The adult flies of _D. germana_ usually occur in the immediate  neighborhood of running or stagnant water and may be swept from the  rank vegetation in such places. The flies rest on the upper surface of  the leaves of tall herbs and low shrubs. In eastern Kansas, the flies  of _D. winnemana_, _D. tigrina_ and _D. minima_ often occur together.  In June, _D. winnemana_ appears on the wing and is found associated  with _Tipula morrisoni_ Alex., _T. mingwe_ Alex., etc.; in July, _D.  minima_ appears, together with _Tipula flavibasis_ Alex., _T.  unimaculata_ Lw., etc.; still later in July _D. tigrina_ emerges and  all three species fly together during August and into September when  they fly with _Tipula ultima_ Alex., _T. unifasciata_ Lw., etc. It is  curious that no other species of Limnobiinae occur in the thamnophytic  association frequented by _Dicranoptycha_. All three species of this  genus as discussed above have habits that are generally similar to one  another. They are usually found resting quietly on the upper surface of  the leaves but fly readily and on slight disturbance. Pairs in  copulation are often found resting, the bodies directed away from one  another and the wings folded over the abdomen. While thus united they  fly readily, sometimes the female taking the initiative, sometimes the  rather smaller male. The eggs are deposited in the soft earth in these  situations.      NATURAL AFFINITIES    In the Monographs (1869) Osten Sacken included the genus  _Dicranoptycha_ in his tribe (section) Limnobina anomala, or, as it  subsequently became known, the Rhamphidini, and still later the  Antochini. A recent survey of the immature stages of several Antochine  genera has shown that the tribe is merely an artificial grouping based  on superficial resemblance of the adult flies. This heterogeneous  assemblage includes representatives of at least three other tribes,  _Dicranoptycha_, together with _Antocha_, _Elliptera_, _Rhamphidia_,  etc., showing an undeniable affinity with the Limnobiini, whereas  _Teucholabis_, _Elephantomyia_, etc., show an equally clear  relationship with the Eriopterini. Moreover a close phylogenetic  relationship with the lowermost subtribes of the Hexatomini (_Ularia_,  _Epiphragmaria_, etc.), is easily apparent.    _Dicranoptycha_ shows the closest affinities with _Antocha_ and  _Rhamphidia_. The larvae of these three genera, each of which typifies a  division, show the following common characters:    Abdominal segments with basal transverse creeping welts or areas of  microscopic points. The massive compact head-capsule with the  praefrontal sclerite large, distinct, the externo-lateral plates large,  mussel-shaped and very thin. The mentum is not completely divided  medially. The maxillae are large and of primitive structure, the  cardines and stipites distinct, the two distal lobes large, subequal in  size, covered with hairs and bearing sensory organs. Mandibles with one  or more dorsal and two or more ventral teeth in addition to the apical  point.    The differences between these allied divisions are best indicated by a  key.

Description of the Species.      DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIES    1916 _Dicranoptycha winnemana_ Alexander; Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.,  pp. 500, 501; Pl. 25, fig. 12.    _Larva._--Length, 20-22 mm.            Diameter, 0.9-1.1 mm.    Coloration varying from white to almost black depending on the nature  and amount of the food eaten which shows clearly through the  transparent integument. The fat-bodies likewise show through and give a  white color to the larva especially after death.    Form very elongate (fig. 1), body terete; integument very glabrous,  transparent and glassy. Prothoracic segment a little longer than the  mesothorax which, in turn, slightly exceeds the metathorax. The  intermediate abdominal segments are elongated. The basal ring of  sternites two to eight bears a transverse band or area of microscopic  chitinized spicules, the one on the eighth segment split lengthwise by  a capillary line. A similar band occurs in the same position on the  dorsum of the eighth segment but the pleural region is devoid of such a  band.    Spiracular disk (fig. 8) moderate in size, obliquely truncated,  surrounded by four lobes, a pair of small, slender, lateral lobes and  short, broader ventral lobes. The usual dorso-median lobe is lacking  but its position is indicated by a gently rounded convexity. The inner  face of the lateral lobe bears a narrow semi-lunate black mark with the  concavity toward the spiracle, the proximal end acutely pointed. The  ventral lobes bear a similar but smaller subrectangular black mark. A  pale and usually indistinct dusky mark occupies the inner face of the  dorsal lobe. On the disk between, and slightly below the level of, the  spiracles is a large brown triangular or V-shaped mark. The spiracles  are small, separated from one another by a distance equal to about 2.5  to 3 times the diameter of one; the center-piece of the spiracle is  black, the ring yellow surrounded by an outer dusky margin. Anal gills  fleshy and protuberant as a blunt ring surrounding the anus (fig. 10).    Head-capsule (fig. 2) of the compact, massive type of the Limnobiini;  praefrontal sclerite (fig. 3) large and distinct; the sclerite broad  with the sides subparallel to about midlength, thence tapering  gradually to the tip which is entire; there are two or three punctures  at the margin before midlength. Interno-lateral plates narrow, a little  longer than the praefrons; externo-lateral plates very broad, thin and  flattened with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#3)"],[1,"used are listed below:    ENTRAPMENT DEVICES.--Hoop and fyke nets and wire traps were used for  288 trap/net hours in 1957. The nets were not baited, and were set  parallel to the current, with the mouths downstream. Hoop nets were  11/2 to three feet in diameter at the first hoop, with a pot-mesh of  one inch; fyke nets were three feet at the first hoop, pot-mesh of  one inch; wire traps, with an opening at each end, were 21/2 feet in  diameter and covered with one-inch-mesh, galvanized chicken wire.    GILL NETS.--Experimental gill nets were set on three occasions in  areas with little current. These nets were 125 feet in length, with  3/4 to two inch bar-mesh in 25-foot sections.    SEINES.--Seining was used more than other methods. An attempt was made  to seine all habitats at each station. In swift water, seine-hauls  were usually made downstream, but in quiet areas seining was done  randomly. Haul-seines six to 60 feet in length, three to eight feet in  depth, and with meshes of 1/8 to 1/2 inch were used. For collection of  riffle-fishes, the seine was planted below a selected area and the  bottom was kicked violently by one member of the party, while one or  two persons held the seine, raising it when the area had been  thoroughly disturbed. Seining on riffles was done with a four-foot by  four-foot bobbinet seine.    ROTENONE.--Rotenone was used in pools of smaller streams, mouths of  creeks, borrow-pits, and cut-off areas. Both powdered and emulsifiable  rotenone were used. The rotenone was mixed with water and applied by  hand, or into the backwash of an outboard motor.    ELECTRIC SHOCKER.--The electrical unit used in this study generated  115 volts and 600 to 700 watts, alternating current. The shocking unit  consisted of two booms, each with two electrodes, mounted on and  operated from a slowly moving boat. Fish were recovered in scape nets,  or in many cases were identified as they lay stunned and were not  collected.      _Estimation of Relative Abundance_    Data on relative abundance of fishes were obtained by counts of seine  hauls at 29 of the 59 stations, counts of rotenoned fish at seven  stations, and results with the electric shocker at nine stations.  Counts were usually made in the field; however, in some collections  all fish were preserved and counted in the laboratory. Some fish (or  \"swirls\" presumed to be fish) observed while shocking were not  identified and are not included in the calculations. However, all fish  positively identified while shocking are included.      _Age and Growth of Fishes_    Fish from selected size-groups were aged in this study. Scales for  age-determinations were removed from positions recommended by Lagler  (1952:108). Scales were placed in water between glass slides and were  read on a standard scale-projection device.    Pectoral spines of catfish were removed from one or both sides,  sectioned, and read by methods described by Marzolf (1955:243-244).    Calculation of length at the last annulus for both scale-fish and  catfish was made by direct proportion. All measurements are of total  length to the nearest tenth of an inch unless specified otherwise.      _Creel Census_    From April 6 to May 28, 1957, a creel census was taken below Turtle  Creek Dam. From June 16 to July 24, 1958, I periodically visited the  main points of access to the Big Blue River, beginning approximately  eight miles downstream from Tuttle Creek Dam and ending six miles  upstream from the maximal extension of the reservoir at capacity  level. Access-points consisted of 11 bridges, two power dams, and  three areas where county roads approached the river. Eleven eight-hour  days were spent in the 1957 census and 22 checks in 15 days were made  in 1958. An equal number of morning (6:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon) and  afternoon (12:00 noon to 8:30 p.m.) checks were made.    Fishermen contacted were asked the following questions: home address  (or residence at the time of the fishing trip); time they started  fishing; kind of fish sought; number and kinds of fish in possession;  and baits used. Also, the number of poles and type of fishing (from  the bank, from boat, _etc._) were recorded. Fishes caught were  examined to confirm identifications. About 80 per cent of all  fishermen seen were contacted.    Fish per man-hour, as used in this report, refers to the average  number of fish of all species caught by one fisherman in one hour.  Fisherman-day is the average time spent fishing in one day by one  person. Because some fishermen used more than one pole, the data are  also expressed as catch per pole-hour.          COLLECTING STATIONS      In the list that follows, stations are numbered consecutively from the  mouth of the Big Blue River, listing stations on each tributary as it  is ascended. The letters following station-numbers indicate the  general type of stream: S = sandy; M = muddy; and G = gravelly. The  Big Blue River is the boundary between Riley and Pottawatomie  counties, Kansas, along part of its length. Stations in this area have  been designated Riley County. The legal description of each station is  followed by the date(s) of collection, and each station is plotted in  Figure 2.       [Illustration: FIG. 2.
