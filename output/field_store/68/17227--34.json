Then back she came to where the  Dinewans were still feeding. When Dinewan saw her coming and noticed  she had only two young ones with her, she called out: \"Where are all  your young ones?\"    Goomblegubbon answered, \"I have killed them, and have only two left.  Those will have plenty to eat now, and will soon grow as big as your  young ones.\"    \"You cruel mother to kill your children. You greedy mother. Why, I have  twelve children and I find food for them all. I would not kill one for  anything, not even if by so doing I could get back my wings. There is  plenty for all. Look at the emu bush how it covers itself with berries  to feed my big family. See how the grasshoppers come hopping round, so  that we can catch them and fatten on them.\"    \"But you have only two children.\"    \"I have twelve. I will go and bring them to show you.\" Dinewan ran off  to her salt bush where she had hidden her ten young ones. Soon she was  to be seen coming back. Running with her neck stretched forward, her  head thrown back with pride, and the feathers of her boobootella  swinging as she ran, booming out the while her queer throat noise, the  Dinewan song of joy, the pretty, soft-looking little ones with their  zebra-striped skins, running beside her whistling their baby Dinewan  note. When Dinewan reached the place where Goomblegubbon was, she  stopped her booing and said in a solemn tone, \"Now you see my words are  true, I have twelve young ones, as I said. You can gaze at my loved  ones and think of your poor murdered children. And while you do so I  will tell you the fate of your descendants for ever. By trickery and  deceit you lost the Dinewans their wings, and now for evermore, as long  as a Dinewan has no wings, so long shall a Goomblegubbon lay only two  eggs and have only two young ones. We are quits now. You have your  wings and I my children.\"    And ever since that time a Dinewan, or emu, has had no wings, and a  Goomblegubbon, or bustard of the plains, has laid only two eggs in a  season.          2.  THE GALAH, AND OOLAH THE LIZARD      Oolah the lizard was tired of lying in the sun, doing nothing. So he  said, \"I will go and play.\" He took his boomerangs out, and began to  practise throwing them. While he was doing so a Galah came up, and  stood near, watching the boomerangs come flying back, for the kind of  boomerangs Oolah was throwing were the bubberahs. They are smaller than  others, and more curved, and when they are properly thrown they return  to the thrower, which other boomerangs do not.    Oolah was proud of having the gay Galah to watch his skill. In his  pride he gave the bubberah an extra twist, and threw it with all his  might. Whizz, whizzing through the air, back it came, hitting, as it  passed her, the Galah on the top of her head, taking both feathers and  skin clean off. The Galah set up a hideous, cawing, croaking shriek,  and flew about, stopping every few minutes to knock her head on the  ground like a mad bird. Oolah was so frightened when he saw what he had  done, and noticed that the blood was flowing from the Galah's head,  that he glided away to hide under a bindeah bush. But the Galah saw  him. She never stopped the hideous noise she was making for a minute,  but, still shrieking, followed Oolah. When she reached the bindeah bush  she rushed at Oolah, seized him with her beak, rolled him on the bush  until every bindeah had made a hole in his skin. Then she rubbed his  skin with her own bleeding head. \"Now then,\" she said, \"you Oolah shall  carry bindeahs on you always, and the stain of my blood.\"    \"And you,\" said Oolah, as he hissed with pain from the tingling of the  prickles, \"shall be a bald-headed bird as long as I am a red prickly  lizard.\"    So to this day, underneath the Galah's crest you can always find the  bald patch which the bubberah of Oolah first made. And in the country  of the Galahs are lizards coloured reddish brown, and covered with  spikes like bindeah prickles.          3.  BAHLOO THE MOON AND THE DAENS      Bahloo the moon looked down at the earth one night, when his light was  shining quite brightly, to see if any one was moving. When the earth  people were all asleep was the time he chose for playing with his three  dogs. He called them dogs, but the earth people called them snakes, the  death adder, the black snake, and the tiger snake. As he looked down on  to the earth, with his three dogs beside him, Bahloo saw about a dozen  daens, or black fellows, crossing a Creek. He called to them saying,  \"Stop, I want you to carry my dogs across that creek.\" But the black  fellows, though they liked Bahloo well, did not like his dogs, for  sometimes when he had brought these dogs to play on the earth, they had  bitten not only the earth dogs but their masters; and the poison left  by the bites had killed those bitten. So the black fellows said, \"No,  Bahloo, we are too frightened; your dogs might bite us. They are not  like our dogs, whose bite would not kill us.\"    Bahloo said, \"If you do what I ask you, when you die you shall come to  life again, not die and stay always where you are put when you are  dead. See this piece of bark. I throw it into the water.\" And he threw  a piece of bark into the creek. \"See it comes to the top again and  floats. That is what would happen to you if you would do what I ask  you: first under when you die, then up again at once. If you will not  take my dogs over, you foolish daens, you will die like this,\" and he  threw a stone into the creek, which sank to the bottom. \"You will be  like that stone, never rise again, Wombah daens!\"    But the black fellows said, \"We cannot do it, Bahloo. We are too  frightened of your dogs.\"    \"I will come down and carry them over myself to show you that they are  quite safe and harmless.\" And down he came, the black snake coiled  round one arm, the tiger snake round the other, and the death adder on  his shoulder, coiled towards his neck. He carried them over. When he  had crossed the creek he picked up a big stone, and he threw it into  the water, saying, \"Now, you cowardly daens, you would not do what I,  Bahloo, asked you to do, and so forever you have lost the chance of  rising again after you die. You will just stay where you are put, like  that stone does under the water, and grow, as it does, to be part of  the earth. If you had done what I asked you, you could have died as  often as I die, and have come to life as often as I come to life. But  now you will only be black fellows while you live, and bones when you  are dead.\"    Bahloo looked so cross, and the three snakes hissed so fiercely, that  the black fellows were very glad to see them disappear from their sight  behind the trees. The black fellows had always been frightened of  Bahloo's dogs, and now they hated them, and they said, \"If we could get  them away from Bahloo we would kill them.\" And thenceforth, whenever  they saw a snake alone they killed it. But Babloo only sent more, for  he said, \"As long as there are black fellows there shall be snakes to  remind them that they would not do what I asked them.\"          4.  THE ORIGIN OF THE NARRAN LAKE      Old Byamee said to his two young wives, Birrahgnooloo and  Cunnunbeillee, \"I have stuck a white feather between the hind legs of a  bee, and am going to let it go and then follow it to its nest, that I  may get honey. While I go for the honey, go you two out and get frogs  and yams, then meet me at Coorigel Spring, where we will camp, for  sweet and clear is the water there.\" The wives, taking their goolays  and yam sticks, went out as he told them. Having gone far, and dug out  many yams and frogs, they were tired when they reached Coorigel, and,  seeing the cool, fresh water, they longed to bathe. But first they  built a bough shade, and there left their goolays holding their food,  and the yams and frogs they had found. When their camp was ready for  the coming of Byamee, who having wooed his wives with a nullah-nullah,  kept them obedient by fear of the same weapon, then went the girls to  the spring to bathe. Gladly they plunged in, having first divested them  selves of their goomillahs, which they were still young enough to wear,  and which they left on the ground near the spring. Scarcely were they  enjoying the cool rest the water gave their hot, tired limbs, when they  were seized and swallowed by two kurreahs. Having swallowed the girls,  the kurreahs dived into an opening in the side of the spring, which was  the entrance to an underground watercourse leading to the Narran River.  Through this passage they went, taking all the water from the spring  with them into the Narran, whose course they also dried as they went  along.    Meantime Byamee, unwitting the fate of his wives, was honey hunting. He  had followed the bee with the white feather on it for some distance;  then the bee flew on to some budtha flowers, and would move no further.  Byamee said, \"Something has happened, or the bee would not stay here  and refuse to be moved on towards its nest. I must go to Coorigel  Spring and see if my wives are safe. Something terrible has surely  happened.\" And Byamee turned in haste towards the spring. When he  reached there he saw the bough shed his wives had made, he saw the yams  they had dug from the ground, and he saw the frogs, but Birrahgnooloo  and Cunnunbeillee he saw not. He called aloud for them. But no answer.  He went towards the spring; on the edge of it he saw the goomillahs of  his wives. He looked into the spring and, seeing it dry, he said, \"It  is the work of the kurreahs; they have opened the underground passage  and gone with my wives to the river, and opening the passage has dried  the spring. Well do I know where the passage joins the Narran, and  there will I swiftly go.\" Arming himself with spears and woggarahs he  started in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#3)"],[1,"is to say, streamsides and marshy areas  where the predominant vegetation is grass, sedges, willows, and  alders. Since these animals are less common within the montane  forests, hydrosere communities, rather than the actual forest, seem to  be the positive feature important for the shrews.    The shrews of the montane region just described were regarded by  Jackson as belonging to two species: _Sorex obscurus_, occupying all  the Rocky Mountains south to, and including, the Sacramento Mountains;  _S. vagrans_, made up of small individuals from various places in  Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado, and all the shrews of western New  Mexico and all of Arizona. My study of these animals has led me to  conclude that the smaller shrews of Arizona and New Mexico intergrade  in a clinal fashion with the shrews of Colorado and in fact represent  but one species. Since some individuals from Colorado are as small as  larger individuals from this southwestern population of small animals,  I conclude that such specimens are the basis for reports of _S.  vagrans_ from Colorado. The shrews of the Sacramento Mountains  resemble those of the Colorado Rockies more than they do the smaller  shrews of western New Mexico and Arizona, possibly because the climate  is similar in the Sacramento Mountains and the higher Colorado  Rockies. There is less precipitation in the more western mountain  ranges in New Mexico and in Arizona in April, May, and June than in  the Colorado Rockies. These months are critical for the reproduction  and growth of shrews.    As mentioned above, the shrews from east of the continental divide in  Montana are smaller than those of the other mountains of the state,  and it is upon such small animals that the name _Sorex vagrans_ has  been based in this area. It is clear, however, that these smaller  animals intergrade with the larger shrews of the more western  mountains. The small size might be an adaptation to the lesser  precipitation and harsher continental climate east of the continental  divide in Montana.      Great Basin and Columbia Plateau Section    The vagrant shrews of the Great Basin and adjoining Columbia Plateau  and Snake River Plains are smaller than their relatives in the Rocky  Mountains and, by virtue of less gray in their pelage, are reddish in  summer and blackish rather than grayish in winter. There is little  significant geographic variation in shrews throughout this region,  although owing to their restriction to the vicinity of water, the  populations of shrews are more or less isolated from one another and  each is somewhat different from the next. Those from nearest the  Rockies are sometimes slightly larger and those from some places in  Nevada are slightly paler than the average. This small reddish shrew  is found all the way to the Pacific coast of California, Oregon, and  Washington. In these coastal areas it is somewhat darker and sometimes  a trifle larger than elsewhere. It intergrades with a somewhat larger,  grayer shrew in the Sierra Nevada of California. Along the Wasatch  front in Utah, this Great Basin shrew intergrades with the larger,  grayer shrew of the Rockies. Owing to the abrupt change in elevation,  the zone of intergradation is rather narrow horizontally. In the  latitude of Salt Lake City, populations of intergrades occur at  between 8,700 and 9,000 feet elevation. The lowland shrew occurs in  the eastern part of the Snake River Plains, and along the valleys of  the Bear and Salt rivers into Wyoming. Along the northern edge of the  Snake River Plains and on the western edge of the mountains of central  Idaho the transition from lowland to montane habitats is abrupt and in  consequence the zone of contact between small and large shrews is  narrow. In northern Idaho and northwestern Montana the transition from  lowland to highland is more gradual. Tributaries of the Columbia River  system, especially the Clark Fork, provide a path for movement of  lowland forms into intermontane basins of western Montana. In  addition, the vegetational zones are found at lower elevations, and  there are boreal forests in the lowlands rather than only in the  mountains as is the case in Utah and Colorado. In this area,  therefore, the zone of intergradation between the smaller lowland  shrew and the larger montane shrew is more gradual and gradually  intergrading populations are found over a relatively large area. This  has been well demonstrated for northwestern Montana by Clothier  (1950). In southern British Columbia and northern Washington this  shrew in the mountains is large and in the intermontane valleys is  small. There is extensive interdigitation of valleys and mountain  ranges, and, consequently, of life-zones in this region. In a few  places, recognizably distinct populations of the vagrant shrew occur  within a few miles of one another, but in other places there are  populations of intergrades. West of the Cascades no evidence of  intergradation has been found and the two kinds occur almost side by  side and maintain their distinctness.    These Great Basin shrews dwell in hydrosere communities as do their  Rocky Mountain counterparts. In this arid region such a habitat  obviously is the only one habitable for a shrew of the _vagrans_  group. These shrews often maintain their predilection for such  habitats when they reach the Pacific coast, and are commonly found in  such places as coastal marshes, marshy meadows, and streamsides, while  the woodlands are inhabited by other species.    These small shrews of the Great Basin and the small vagrant shrews of  the Pacific Coast were called _Sorex vagrans_ by Jackson.      Summary of Geographic Variation    Large reddish shrews of the coast of California and southwestern  Oregon become smaller and darker to the north. From southwestern  British Columbia they again become larger as one proceeds northward  along the coast to Wrangell, Alaska, and north of that they again  become smaller. Moving inland from the coast the shrews become  markedly smaller in Alaska and British Columbia. The smaller inland  and montane form occurs south through the Rocky Mountains, becoming  slightly smaller in central Montana, slightly larger in southeastern  New Mexico, and slightly smaller in western New Mexico and in Arizona.  This montane form intergrades with a smaller more reddish Great Basin  shrew, the zone of intergradation roughly following the western slope  of the Rocky Mountains. The Great Basin shrew occurs westward to the  Pacific Coast; there the Great Basin shrew occurs with, although in  part it is ecologically separated from, the large reddish coastal  shrews.    There seems to be an intergrading chain of subspecies of one species,  the end members of which (the small Great Basin form and the large  coastal form) are so different in size and ecological niche that they  are able to coexist without interbreeding. In southern British  Columbia the morphological differences are not so marked as farther  south along the Pacific Coast. There, in British Columbia,  reproductive isolation is not complete and occasional populations of  intergrades occur. In Montana extensive intergradation occurs in a  broad zone of transitional habitat. Along the western edge of the  Rockies from Idaho south to Utah the zone of transition from montane  to basin habitat is sharp and the zone of intergradation, although  present, is fairly narrow, perhaps because there is little  intermediate habitat which logically might be expected to be most  suitable for intergrading populations.    The oldest name applied to a shrew of the group under consideration is  _Sorex vagrans_ Baird, 1858, the type locality of which is Willapa  Bay, Pacific County, Washington. The name applies to the small vagrant  shrew of this area, rather than to the larger forest dweller which has  been known as _Sorex obscurus_. The name _S. vagrans_, in the specific  sense, must therefore apply to all the shrews discussed which have  heretofore been known by the names _S. pacificus_, _S. yaquinae_, _S.  obscurus_, and _S. vagrans_.    A situation such as the one here described where well differentiated  end members of a chain of subspecies overlap over an extensive  geographic range throughout the year without interbreeding--thus  reacting toward one another as do full species--so far as I know has  not previously been found to exist in mammals. The overlapping  end-members of the chain of subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ really do  coexist; specimens of the overlapping subspecies have been taken  together at the same localities from California to British Columbia.  I have taken a specimen of _S. v. vagrans_ and several of _S. v.  setosus_ in the same woodlot at Fort Lewis, Pierce County, Washington.  Two subspecies of deer, _Odocoileus hemionus_, in the Sierra Nevada of  California, occur together over a sizeable area but for only a part of  each year that does not include the breeding season (Cowan,  1936:156-157). In the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, the  geographic ranges of several pairs of subspecies meet at certain  places without intergradation of the two kinds. In these instances  well marked ecological differences exist between the subspecies  involved. In western Washington, for example, the geographic range of  the lowland subspecies, _P. m. austerus_, interdigitates to the  east and west with the range of the montane and coniferous  forest-inhabiting subspecies, _P. m. oreas_, and the two kinds have  not been shown to intergrade. _Peromyscus maniculatus artemesiae_ and  _P. m. osgoodi_ come together without interbreeding in Glacier  National Park, Montana. _P. m. artemesiae_ is almost entirely a  forest-dwelling subspecies, whereas _osgoodi_ is an inhabitant of open  country. The two kinds do not actually occur together ecologically  although they occur together in buildings at the edge of the woods  (A. Murie, 1933:4-5).       [Illustration: FIG. 5."]]]
