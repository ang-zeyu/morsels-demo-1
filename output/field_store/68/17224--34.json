Similar study applied to robins would reveal as surprisingly rich  results, but probably less funny. No bird that we have has so varied a  repertoire as Robin Goodfellow, and I do not believe that any boy or  girl alive could recognise him by every one of his calls and songs.  His softly warbled salute to the sunrise differs from his lovely  even-song just as widely as the rapturous melody of his courting days  differs from the more subdued, tranquil love song to his brooding  mate. Indignation, suspicion, fright, interrogation, peace of mind,  hate, caution to take flight--these and a host of other thoughts, are  expressed through his flexible voice.      [Illustration]  \"It is only when he is a baby that you could guess our robin is really  a thrush.\"      [Illustration]  Young bluebirds taking their first walk.    {9}    Toward the end of June, you may see robins flying in flocks after  sun-down. Old males and young birds of the first brood scatter  themselves over the country by day to pick up the best living they  can, but at night they collect in large numbers at some favourite  roosting place. Oftentimes the weary mother birds are now raising  second broods. We like to believe that the fathers return from the  roosts at sun-up to help supply those insatiable babies with worms  throughout the long day.    After family cares are over for the year, robins moult, and then they  hide, mope, and keep silent for awhile. But in September, in a suit of  new feathers, they are feeling vigorous and cheerful again; and,  gathering in friendly flocks, they roam about the woodland borders to  feed on the dogwood, choke cherries, juniper berries, and other small  fruits. You see they change their diet with the season. By dropping  the undigested berry seeds far and wide, they plant great numbers of  trees and shrubs as they travel. Birds help to make the earth  beautiful. With them every day is Arbour Day.    It is a very dreary time when the last robin leaves us, and an  exceptionally cold winter when a few stragglers from the south-bound  flocks do not remain in some sheltered, sunny, woodland hollow.      THE BLUEBIRD    Is there any sign of spring quite so welcome as the glint of the first  bluebird unless it is his {10} softly whistled song? Before the farmer  begins to plough the wet earth, often while the snow is still on the  ground, this hardy little minstrel is making himself very much at home  in our orchards and gardens while waiting for a mate to arrive from  the South.    Now is the time to have ready on top of the grape arbour, or under the  eaves of the barn, or nailed up in the apple tree, or set up on poles,  the little one-roomed houses that bluebirds are only too happy to  occupy. More enjoyable neighbours it would be hard to find. Sparrows  will fight for the boxes, it is true, but if there are plenty to let,  and the sparrows are persistently driven off, the bluebirds, which are  a little larger though far less bold, quickly take possession. Birds  that come earliest in the season and feed on insects, before they have  time to multiply, are of far greater value in the field, orchard, and  garden than birds that delay their return until warm weather has  brought forth countless swarms of insects far beyond the control of  either bird or man. Many birds would be of even greater service than  they are if they received just a little encouragement to make their  homes nearer ours. They could save many more millions of dollars'  worth of crops for the farmers than they do if they were properly  protected while rearing their ever-hungry families. As two or even  three broods {11} of bluebirds may be raised in a box each spring, and  as insects are their most approved baby food, you see how much it is  to our interest to set up nurseries for them near our homes.    But when people are not thoughtful enough to provide them before the  first of March, the bluebirds hunt for a cavity in a fence rail, or a  hole in some old tree, preferably in the orchard, shortly after their  arrival, and proceed to line it with grass. From three to six pale  blue eggs are laid. At first the babies are blind, helpless, and  almost naked. Then they grow a suit of dark feathers with speckled,  thrush-like vests similar to their cousin's, the baby robin's; and it  is not until they are able to fly that the lovely deep blue shade  gradually appears on their grayish upper parts. Then their throat,  breast, and sides turn rusty red. While creatures are helpless, a prey  for any enemy to pounce upon, Nature does not dress them  conspicuously, you may be sure. Adult birds, that are able to look out  for themselves, may be very gaily dressed, but their children must  wear sombre clothes until they grow strong and wise.    Young bluebirds are far less wild and noisy than robins, but their  very sharp little claws discourage handling. These pointed hooks on  the ends of their toes help them to climb out of the tree hollow, that  is their natural home, into the big world that their presence makes so  cheerful.    {12}    As you might expect of creatures so heavenly in colour, the  disposition of bluebirds is particularly angelic. Gentleness and  amiability are expressed in their soft, musical voice. _Tru-al-ly,  tru-al-ly_, they sweetly assert when we can scarcely believe that  spring is here; and _tur-wee, tur-wee_ they softly call in autumn when  they go roaming through the country side in flocks of azure, or whirl  through Southern woods to feed on the waxy berries of the mistletoe.      THE WOOD THRUSH    _Called also: Song Thrush; Wood Robin; Bell Bird_    Much more shy and reserved than the social, democratic robin is his  cousin the wood thrush, whom, perhaps, you more frequently hear than  see. Not that he is a recluse, like the hermit thrush, who hides his  nest and lifts up his heavenly voice in deep, cool, forest solitudes;  nor is he even so shy as Wilson's thrush, who prefers to live in low,  wet, densely overgrown Northern woods. The wood thrush, as his name  implies, certainly likes the woodland, but very often he chooses to  stay close to our country and suburban homes or within city parks with  a more than half-hearted determination to be friendly.      [Illustration]  BABY WOOD THRUSHES  Notice the family resemblance between them and the baby robins and  bluebirds.      [Illustration]  A wood thrush startled by the click of the camera.      {13}    He is about two inches shorter than the robin. Above, his feathers are  a rich cinnamon brown, brightest on his head and shoulders and shading  into olive brown on his tail. His white throat and breast and sides  are heavily marked with heart-shaped marks of very dark brown. He has  a white eye ring.    _\"Here am I\"_ come his three clear, bell-like notes of  self-introduction. The quality of his music is delicious, rich,  penetrative, pure and vibrating like notes struck upon a harp. If you  don't already know this most neighbourly of the thrushes--as he is  also the largest and brightest and most heavily spotted of them all--  you will presently become acquainted with one of the finest songsters  in America. Wait until evening when he sings at his best.  _Nolee-a-e-o-lee-nolee-aeolee-lee!_ peals his song from the trees.  Love alone inspires his finest strains; but even in July, when bird  music is quite inferior to that of May and June, he is still in good  voice. A song so exquisite proves that the thrush comes near to being  a bird angel, very high in the scale of development, and far, far  beyond such low creatures as ducks and chickens.    _Pit-pit-pit_ you may hear sharply, excitedly jerked out of some  bird's throat, and you wonder if a note so disagreeable can really  come from the wonderful songster on the branch above your head. By  sharply striking two small stones {14} together you can closely  imitate this alarm call. Whom can he be scolding so severely? It is  yourself, of course, for without knowing it you have come nearer to  his low nest in the beech tree than he thinks quite safe. While  sitting, the mother bird is, however, quite tame. A photographer I  know placed his camera within four feet of a nest, changed the plates,  and clicked the shutter three times for as many pictures without  disturbing the gentle sitter who merely winked her eye at each chick.    Wood thrushes seem to delight in weaving bits of paper or rags into  their deep cradles which otherwise resemble the robins.' A nest in the  shrubbery near a bird-lover's home in New Jersey had many bits of  newspaper attached to its outer walls, but the most conspicuous strip  in front advertised in large letters \"A House to be Let or Sold.\" The  original builders happily took the next lease, and another lot of  nervous, fidgety baby tenants came out of four light greenish-blue  eggs; but, as usual, they moved away to the woods, after ten days, to  join the choir invisible.      WILSON'S THRUSH    The veery, as the Wilson's thrush is called in New England, is far  more common there than {15} the wood thrush, whose range is more  southerly. During its spring and fall migrations only is it at all  common about the elms and maples that men have planted. Take a good  look at its tawny coat and lightly spotted cream buff breast before it  goes away to hide. Like Kipling's \"cat that walked by himself,\" the  veery prefers the \"wild, wet woods,\" and there its ringing, weird,  whistling monotone, that is so melodious without being a melody, seems  to come from you can't guess where. The singer keeps hidden in the  dense, dark undergrowth. It is as if two voices, an alto and a  soprano, were singing at the same time: _Whee-you, whee-you_:--the  familiar notes might come from a scythe being sharpened on a  whetstone, were the sound less musical than it is. The bird is too  wise to sing very near its well-hidden nest, which is placed either  directly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#3)"],[1,"to rule, has not, I  believe, been before narrated. Though Suttee has been so often  described, the account of it in these pages possesses much interest  and novelty, probably from having been written by an eye-witness,  before that institution was disturbed by European influence. An  allusion to the English longbow as to a weapon in actual use, gives  an appearance of antiquity to this narrative even greater than that  which belongs to its date. The orthography of the manuscript is not  always uniform, therefore where a name is spelt in two different  ways, I have left them as they are given. I have altered the  original spelling of the names of only a few familiar places, and  have retained the Portuguese expressions of Moor and Gentile, which  mean Mussulman and heathen, one of which has survived up to the  present time in Southern India as Moorman.    Any further observations I may have to make on this manuscript will  be found in the notes.    I wish to express my thanks to Sr. D. Gregorio Romero Larranaga, the  head of the Barcelona Library, and to the other gentlemen of his  department, for the cordial manner in which they have supplied me  with the contents of their Library, and for their assistance in  discussing doubtful points.      London, October 21, 1865.    [Illustration: facsimile of handwritten manuscript.]    [Illustration: facsimile of handwritten manuscript.]          PREFACE.    (TRANSLATED FROM THE PORTUGUESE EDITION, LISBON, 1812.)      I, Duarte Barbosa, a native of the very noble city of Lisbon, having  navigated for a great part of my youth in the Indies discovered in  the name of the king our lord, and having travelled through many and  various countries neighbouring to the coast, and having seen and  heard various things, which I judged to be marvellous and  stupendous, and which had never been seen nor heard of by our  ancestors, resolved to write them for the benefit of all, as I saw  and heard of them from day to day, striving to declare in this my  book the towns and limits of all those kingdoms to which I went in  person, or of which I had trustworthy information; and also which  were kingdoms and countries of the Moors and which of the Gentiles,  and their customs. Neither have I left in silence their traffic, the  merchandise which is met with in them, the places where they are  produced, nor whither they are transported. And besides what I saw  personally, I always delighted in inquiring of the Moors,  Christians, and Gentiles, as to the usages and customs which they  practised, and the points of information thus gained I endeavoured  to combine together so as to have a more exact knowledge of them,  this being always my special object, as it should be of all those  who write on such matters; and I am convinced that it will be  recognized that I have not spared any diligence in order to obtain  this object, as far as the feeble extent of the power of my  understanding allows of. It was in the present year of 1516 that I  finished writing this my book.          DESCRIPTION OF THE EAST INDIES AND COUNTRIES ON THE SEABORD OF THE  INDIAN OCEAN IN 1514.[3]    THE CAPE OF ST. SEBASTIAN AFTER PASSING THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.      Having passed the Cape of Good Hope in a north-easterly direction,  at Cape San Sebastian, there are very fair mountain lands, and  fields, and valleys, in which there are many cows and sheep, and  other wild animals; it is a country inhabited by people who are  black and naked. They only wear skins with the fur of deer, or other  wild animals, like some cloaks in the French fashion, of which  people the Portuguese, up to the present time, have not been able to  obtain information, nor to become acquainted with what there is in  the interior of the country. They have no navigation, neither do  they make use of the sea, neither have the Moors of Arabia and  Persia, or the Indies, ever navigated as far as this, nor discovered  them, on account of the strong currents of the sea, which is very  stormy.      ISLANDS OF THE GREAT UCIQUES.[4]    Having passed Cape San Sebastian towards the north-east for India,  there are some islands close to the mainland to the east, which are  called the Great Uciques; in which, on the side towards the mainland  there are a few small towns of Moors, who deal with the people of  the continent, and they provision themselves from them. In these  Uciques much amber is found of good quality, which the Moors collect  and sell in other places, and likewise many pearls and small seed  pearls are found in the sea in beds (crusts), which they cannot  gather or fish up, and whenever they do get them out they boil them,  and extract the said pearls and seed pearls dingy and burnt, and  there is no doubt that there are many and good ones, if they knew  how to extract them, as is done in Sael, Cochoromandel, and in  Barahe,[5] which will be mentioned hereafter.      THE LITTLE VCIQUES ISLANDS IN RIVERS.    Having passed the Vciques grandes towards Sofala, a fortress which  the King of Portugal made there, and where there is much gold, at  xvii or xviii leagues from it there are some rivers, which make  between their branches, islands, called the Little Vciques, in which  there are some villages of the Moors, who also deal with the  Gentiles of the mainland in their provisions, which are rice,  millet, and meat, and which they bring in small barks to Sufala.[6]      SOFALA.    Having passed the Little Vciques, for the Indies, at xviii leagues  from them there is a river which is not very large, whereon is a  town of the Moors called Sofala,[7] close to which town the King of  Portugal has a fort. These Moors established themselves there a long  time ago on account of the great trade in gold which they carry on  with the Gentiles of the mainland: these speak somewhat of bad  Arabic (garabia), and have got a king over them, who is at present  subject to the King of Portugal.[8] And the mode of their trade is  that they come by sea in small barks which they call zanbucs  (sambuk), from the kingdoms of Quiloa, and Mombaza, and Melindi; and  they bring much cotton cloth of many colours, and white and blue,  and some of silk; and grey, and red, and yellow beads, which come to  the said kingdoms in other larger ships from the great kingdom of  Cambay, which merchandise these Moors buy and collect from other  Moors who bring them there, and they pay for them in gold by weight,  and for a price which satisfies them; and the said Moors keep them  and sell these cloths to the Gentiles of the kingdom of Benamatapa  who come there laden with gold, which gold they give in exchange for  the before mentioned cloths without weighing, and so much in  quantity that these Moors usually gain one hundred for one. They  also collect a large quantity of ivory, which is found all round  Sofala, which they likewise sell in the great kingdom of Cambay at  five or six ducats the hundred weight, and so also some amber, which  these Moors of Sofala bring them from the Vciques. They are black  men, and men of colour--some speak Arabic, and the rest make use of  the language of the Gentiles of the country. They wrap themselves  from the waist downwards with cloths of cotton and silk, and they  wear other silk cloths above named, such as cloaks and wraps for the  head, and some of them wear hoods of scarlet, and of other coloured  woollen stuffs and camelets, and of other silks. And their victuals  are millet, and rice, and meat, and fish. In this river near to the  sea there are many sea horses, which go in the sea, and come out on  land at times to feed. These have teeth like small elephants, and it  is better ivory than that of the elephant, and whiter and harder,  and of greater durability of colour. In the country all round Sofala  there are many elephants, which are very large and wild, and the  people of the country do not know how to tame them: there are also  many lions, ounces, mountain panthers, wild asses, and many other  animals. It is a country of plains and mountains, and well watered.  The Moors have now recently begun to produce much fine cotton in  this country, and they weave it into white stuff because they do not  know how to dye it, or because they have not got any colours; and  they take the blue or coloured stuffs of Cambay and unravel them,  and again weave the threads with their white thread, and in this  manner they make coloured stuffs, by means of which they get much  gold.      KINGDOM OF BENAMATAPA.    On entering within this country of Sofala, there is the kingdom of  Benamatapa, which is very large and peopled by Gentiles, whom the  Moors call Cafers. These are brown men, who go bare, but covered  from the waist downwards with coloured stuffs, or skins of wild  animals; and the persons most in honour among them wear some of the  tails of the skin behind them, which go trailing on the ground for  state and show, and they make bounds and movements of their bodies,  by which they make these tails wag on either side of them. They  carry swords in scabbards of wood bound with gold or other metals,  and they wear them on the left hand side as we do, in sashes of  coloured stuffs, which they make for this purpose with four or five  knots, and their tassels hanging down, like gentlemen; and in their  hands azagayes, and others carry bows and arrows: it must be  mentioned that the bows are of middle size, and the iron points of  the arrows are very large and well wrought. They are men of war, and  some of them are merchants: their women go naked as long as they are  girls, only covering their middles with cotton cloths, and when they  are married and have children, they wear other cloths over their  breasts.      ZINBAOCH.[9]    Leaving Sofala for the interior of the country, at xv days journey  from it, there is a large town of Gentiles, which is called  Zinbaoch; and it has houses of wood and straw, in which town the  King of Benamatapa"]]]
