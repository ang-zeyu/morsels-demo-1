It was while hunting here that I had another trip of twenty miles  through the woods over rough corduroy tote road in the night after a  team to take my companion (Vanater by name) out to Alpena to have a  broken leg set. He was carrying a deer on his shoulder and when near  camp it was necessary to cross a small stream to get to the cabin. We  had felled a small tree across the creek for the purpose of crossing.  There was three or four inches of snow on the log and after my  companion was across the creek and just as he was about to step from  the log he slipped and fell, striking his leg across the log in some  manner so that it broke between the knee and ankle.    After getting my companion to camp and making him as comfortable as  possible, I took a lunch in my knapsack and with an old tin lantern  with a tallow candle in it, which gave about as much light as a  lightning bug, I started over the longest and roughest twenty miles  of road that I ever traveled in the night. Sometimes I would trip on  some stick or log and fall and put out my light but I would get up,  light the candle in the lantern again and hurry on all the faster to  make up for lost time. I made the journey all right and was back to  camp the next day before noon where we found my companion doing as  well as could be expected under the circumstances.    We got my companion out to Alpena where the doctor set the leg and in  the course of two or three weeks he was so far recovered that he was  able to return to camp and keep me company until he was able to again  take up the trap line and trail.    Some years later I again went back to Michigan and hunted deer and  trapped on the Manistee, Boardman and Rapid Rivers, but I found game  and furs had become somewhat scarce in that part so I next went with  a partner to upper Michigan. At that time there was no railroad in  Upper Michigan and but few settlers, after leaving the Straits, until  near Lake Superior and near the copper and iron mines.    I have tried my luck in three of the states west of the Rocky  Mountains. In the Clear Water regions of Idaho there was a fair  showing of big game, with a good sprinkling of the fur bearers,  including a bunch of beaver here and there. (Beaver protected.) I  heard men tell of there being plenty of grizzly and silver tip bear  but I saw no signs of them. In California a trapper told, me of a  large grizzly coming to his shack in the night. He said that he was  cooking venison and that he had the fresh meat of a deer in the shack  and he thought that the bear smelled the meat was what brought him  there. The man said the bear smelled around the shack awhile and then  began to dig at one corner of the shack and soon pulled out the  bottom log. The man kept quiet until the bear pulled out the next log  and put his head in through the hole when he put a ball between the  bear's eyes that fixed Bruin too quick. (A bad case of nightmare.) I  think it doubtful if there is a grizzly bear or at least very few now  to be found south of the British Columbia line.    My best catch of bear in one season with a partner was eleven. Years  ago I caught from three to six bear each season but late years I have  not caught more than one to three. I think that of late the heavy  lumbering going on through Northern Pennsylvania had something to do  with the catch of bear.    The timber in Pennsylvania is largely cut away now leaving bark  slashings which make fine shelter for bear and wildcats and both  animals were apparently quite plenty I would judge from the number  caught in this section, fall of 1907. Deer are very scarce in this  state, perhaps the most to be found are in Pike County.    I can lay claim to one thing that but few hunters and trappers can  do, that is for forty years I lost only two seasons from the trap  line and the trail and each time I was detained by rheumatism. Once  being taken down with sciatica while in the camp trapping and  hunting, and it held me to my bed for several months hard and tight.  I still have the greater part of my trapping and hunting outfit, and  am still in hopes to be able to get out on the line and pinch a few  more toes.        CHAPTER II.    Early Experiences.    As I promised to write something of my early experience at trapping  and hunting, I will begin by saying that I am now living within one  mile of where I was born sixty years ago (this was written in 1904),  and that I began my trapping career by first trapping rats in my  father's grist mill with the old figure four squat trap. I well  remember the many war dances that I had when I could not make the  trap stay set; but I did not trap long inside the mill for father  also ran a blacksmith shop and always kept a good man to do the work  in the shop. I was soon coaxing the smith to make me a steel trap,  which he did. I now began catching muskrats along the tail race and  about the mill dam, but the spring on my trap was so stiff that when  I found the trap sprung or found game in it, I was obliged to bring  the trap to the house and have some one older than I to set it. Then  I would carry it back to the creek and set it. Well this was slow  work and I was continually begging the blacksmith to make me more  traps with weaker springs so I could set them myself. After much  coaxing he made me three more which I was able to set and then the  muskrats began to suffer. Let me say at that time a muskrat skin was  worth more than a mink skin.    Boys, I was like a man in public office, the more of it they have,  the more they want. So it was with me in regard to the traps, but I  could not coax the blacksmith to make any more. An older brother came  to my aid in this way: he told me to go to town and see the  blacksmith there and see if I could not sell some charcoal to him for  traps, and he, (my brother) would help me burn the coal. Now this  burning the coal was done by gathering hemlock knots from old rotten  logs and piling them up and covering them like potato holes, leaving  a hole open at the bottom to start the fire. After the fire was well  started the hole was closed and the knots smoldered for several days.  Well, the plan worked and by the operation I became the possessor of  five more traps. By this time the vicinity of the mill dam and race  was no longer large enough to furnish trapping grounds, and I  ventured farther up and down the stream and took in the coon and mink  along with the muskrat.      [Illustration: WOODCOCK, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW, RESIDENCE AND HIS DOG  MACK.]    We had a neighbor, Washburn by name, who was considered a great  trapper, for he could now and then catch a fox. As time passed by, I  began to have a great desire to get on an equal with Mr. Washburn and  catch a fox. I began to urge him to allow me to go with him to see  how he set his trap, and after a long time coaxing, he granted my  request. I found what everyone of today knows of the chaff bed set.  You may now know that it was not long before I had a bed made near a  barn that stood well back in the field, and after much worry and many  wakeful nights I caught a fox and I thought myself Lord Jonathan. As  time went by, and by chance I learned that by mixing a goodly part of  hen manure with plenty of feathers in it, and mixing it with the  chaff, it was a great improvement on chaff alone. Next I learned of  the well known water set. However, I perhaps set different from the  most of trappers in making this set. Well as all trappers learn from  long years of experience, so have I, and those old-fashioned sets are  like the squat traps, not up-to-date. I will now drop the trapping  question for a time and tell you how I killed my first deer.    Just outside of the clearing on father's farm and not more than fifty  rods from the house was a wet place, such as are known to these parts  as a \"bear wallow.\" This wet place had been salted and was what is  called a \"salt lick.\" In those days it was not an uncommon thing to  see six or eight deer in the field any morning during the summer  season--the same as you will see them in parts of California today.  It was not an uncommon thing for my older brother to kill a deer at  this lick any morning or evening, but that was not making a nimrod of  me. I would beg father to let me take the gun (which was an old  double barreled flintlock shot gun) and watch the lick. As I was only  nine years old, they would not allow me to have the gun, so I was  obliged to steal it out when no one was in sight, carry it to the  barn and then watch my opportunity and \"skipper\" from the barn to the  lick. All worked smoothly and I got to the lick all right. It was  toward sundown and I had scarcely poked the gun through the hole in  the blind and looked out when I saw two or three deer coming toward  the lick. I cocked the old gun and made ready but about this time I  was taken with the worst chill that any boy ever had and I shook so  that I could scarcely hold the gun to the peep hole. It was only a  moment when two of the deer stepped into the lick, and I took the  best aim I could under the condition, and pulled the trigger. Well of  all the bawling a deer ever made, I think this one did the worst, but  I did not stop to see what I had done but took across the field to  the house at a lively gait, leaving the gun in the blind.    The folks heard the shot and saw me running for the house at  break-neck speed (this of course was the first that they knew I was out  with the gun). My older brother came to meet me and see what the  trouble was. When I told him what I had done, he went with me to the  lick and there we found a fair-sized buck wallowing in the lick with  his back broken, one buck shot (or rather one slug, for the gun was  loaded with pieces cut from a bar of lead); one slug had struck and  broken the spine and this was the cause of the deer bawling so loud  as this was the only one that hit.    The old shotgun was now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#3)"],[1,"of  Thi, that royal councillor, that scribe and confidant, whose life must  have been passed in a round of serene activities, amid a sneering,  though doubtless admiring, population.    Into this tomb of white, vivacious figures, gay almost, though never  wholly frivolous--for these men were full of purpose, full of an ardor  that seduces even where it seems grotesque--I took with me a child of  ten called Ali, from the village of Kafiah; and as I looked from him  to the walls around us, rather than the passing away of the races,  I realized the persistence of type. For everywhere I saw the face of  little Ali, with every feature exactly reproduced. Here he was bending  over a sacrifice, leading a sacred bull, feeding geese from a cup,  roasting a chicken, pulling a boat, carpentering, polishing, conducting  a monkey for a walk, or merely sitting bolt upright and sneering. There  were lines of little Alis with their hands held to their breasts, their  faces in profile, their knees rigid, in the happy tomb of Thi; but he  glanced at them unheeding, did not recognize his ancestors. And he did  not care to penetrate into the tombs of Mera and Meri-Ra-ankh, into  the Serapeum and the Mestaba of Ptah-hotep. Perhaps he was right. The  Serapeum is grand in its vastness, with its long and high galleries and  its mighty vaults containing the huge granite sarcophagi of the sacred  bulls of Apis; Mera, red and white, welcomes you from an elevated niche  benignly; Ptah-hotep, priest of the fifth dynasty, receives you, seated  at a table that resembles a rake with long, yellow teeth standing on its  handle, and drinking stiffly a cup of wine. You see upon the wall near  by, with sympathy, a patient being plied by a naked and evidently an  unyielding physician with medicine from a jar that might have been  visited by Morgiana, a musician playing upon an instrument like a huge  and stringless harp. But it is the happy tomb of Thi that lingers  in your memory. In that tomb one sees proclaimed with a marvellous  ingenuity and expressiveness the joy and the activity of life. Thi must  have loved life; loved prayer and sacrifice, loved sport and war, loved  feasting and gaiety, labor of the hands and of the head, loved the arts,  the music of flute and harp, singing by the lingering and plaintive  voices which seem to express the essence of the east, loved sweet odors,  loved sweet women--do we not see him sitting to receive offerings with  his wife beside him?--loved the clear nights and the radiant days that  in Egypt make glad the heart of man. He must have loved the splendid  gift of life, and used it completely. And so little Ali had very right  to make his sole obeisance at Thi's delicious tomb, from which death  itself seems banished by the soft and embracing radiance of the almost  living walls.    This delicate cheerfulness, a quite airy gaiety of life, is often  combined in Egypt, and most beautifully and happily combined, with  tremendous solidity, heavy impressiveness, a hugeness that is well-nigh  tragic; and it supplies a relief to eye, to mind, to soul, that is sweet  and refreshing as the trickle of a tarantella from a reed flute  heard under the shadows of a temple of Hercules. Life showers us with  contrasts. Art, which gives to us a second and a more withdrawn life,  opening to us a door through which we pass to our dreams, may well  imitate life in this.          IV    ABYDOS    Through a long and golden noontide, and on into an afternoon whose  opulence of warmth and light it seemed could never wane, I sat alone,  or wandered gently quite alone, in the Temple of Seti I. at Abydos. Here  again I was in a place of the dead. In Egypt one ever seeks the dead in  the sunshine, black vaults in the land of the gold. But here in Abydos I  was accompanied by whiteness. The general effect of Seti's mighty temple  is that it is a white temple when seen in full sunshine and beneath  a sky of blinding blue. In an arid place it stands, just beyond an  Egyptian village that is a maze of dust, of children, of animals, and  flies. The last blind houses of the village, brown as brown paper,  confront it on a mound, and as I came toward it a girl-child swathed  in purple with ear-rings, and a twist of orange handkerchief above her  eyes, full of cloud and fire, leaned from a roof, sinuously as a young  snake, to watch me. On each side, descending, were white, ruined walls,  stretched out like defaced white arms of the temple to receive me.  I stood still for a moment and looked at the narrow, severely simple  doorway, at the twelve broken columns advanced on either side, white and  greyish white with their right angles, their once painted figures now  almost wholly colorless.    Here lay the Osirians, those blessed dead of the land of Egypt, who  worshipped the Judge of the Dead, the Lord of the Underworld, and who  hoped for immortality through him--Osiris, husband of Isis, Osiris,  receiver of prayers. Osiris the sun who will not be conquered by night,  but eternally rises again, and so is the symbol of the resurrection  of the soul. It is said that Set, the power of Evil, tore the body of  Osiris into fourteen fragments and scattered them over the land. But  multitudes of worshippers of Osiris believed him buried near Abydos and,  like those who loved the sweet songs of Hafiz, they desired to be buried  near him whom they adored; and so this place became a place of the dead,  a place of many prayers, a white place of many longings.    I was glad to be alone there. The guardian left me in perfect peace. I  happily forgot him. I sat down in the shadow of a column upon its mighty  projecting base. The sky was blinding blue. Great bees hummed, like  bourdons, through the silence, deepening the almost heavy calm. These  columns, architraves, doorways, how mighty, how grandly strong they  were! And yet soon I began to be aware that even here, where surely one  should read only the Book of the Dead, or bend down to the hot ground  to listen if perchance one might hear the dead themselves murmuring over  the chapters of Beatification far down in their hidden tombs, there was  a likeness, a gentle gaiety of life, as in the tomb of Thi. The effect  of solidity was immense. These columns bulged, almost like great fruits  swollen out by their heady strength of blood. They towered up in crowds.  The heavy roof, broken in places most mercifully to show squares and  oblongs of that perfect, calling blue, was like a frowning brow. And yet  I was with grace, with gentleness, with lightness, because in the place  of the dead I was again with the happy, living walls. Above me, on the  roof, there was a gleam of palest blue, like the blue I have sometimes  seen at morning on the Ionian sea just where it meets the shore. The  double rows of gigantic columns stretched away, tall almost as forest  trees, to right of me and to left, and were shut in by massive walls,  strong as the walls of a fortress. And on these columns, and on these  walls, dead painters and gravers had breathed the sweet breath of life.  Here in the sun, for me alone, as it seemed, a population followed their  occupations. Men walked, and kneeled, and stood, some white and clothed,  some nude, some red as the red man's child that leaped beyond the  sea. And here was the lotus-flower held in reverent hands, not the  rose-lotus, but the blossom that typified the rising again of the sun,  and that, worn as an amulet, signified the gift of eternal youth. And  here was hawk-faced Horus, and here a priest offering sacrifice to a  god, belief in whom has long since passed away. A king revealed himself  to me, adoring Ptah, \"Father of the beginnings,\" who established upon  earth, my figures thought, the everlasting justice, and again at the  knees of Amen burning incense in his honor. Isis and Osiris stood  together, and sacrifice was made before their sacred bark. And Seti  worshipped them, and Seshta, goddess of learning, wrote in the book of  eternity the name of the king.    The great bees hummed, moving slowly in the golden air among the mighty  columns, passing slowly among these records of lives long over, but  which seemed still to be. And I looked at the lotus-flowers which the  little grotesque hands were holding, had been holding for how many  years--the flowers that typified the rising again of the sun and the  divine gift of eternal youth. And I thought of the bird and the Sphinx,  the thing that was whimsical wooing the thing that was mighty. And I  gazed at the immense columns and at the light and little figures all  about me. Bird and Sphinx, delicate whimsicality, calm and terrific  power! In Egypt the dead men have combined them, and the combination has  an irresistible fascination, weaves a spell that entrances you in the  sunshine and beneath the blinding blue. At Abydos I knew it. And I loved  the columns that seemed blown out with exuberant strength, and I loved  the delicate white walls that, like the lotus-flower, give to the world  a youth that seems eternal--a youth that is never frivolous, but that is  full of the divine, and yet pathetic, animation of happy life.    The great bees hummed more drowsily. I sat quite still in the sun. And  then presently, moved by some prompting instinct, I turned my head, and,  far off, through the narrow portal of the temple, I saw the girl-child  swathed in purple still lying, sinuously as a young snake, upon the  palm-wood roof above the brown earth wall to watch me with her eyes of  cloud and fire.    And upon me, like cloud and fire--cloud of the tombs and the great  temple columns, fire of the brilliant life painted and engraved upon  them--there stole the spell of Egypt.          V    THE NILE    I do not find in Egypt any more the strangeness that once amazed, and  at first almost bewildered me. Stranger by far is Morocco, stranger  the country beyond Biskra, near Mogar, round Touggourt, even about El  Kantara. "]]]
