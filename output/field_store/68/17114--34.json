He is the father of Vulcan [In Greek  Hephaistos], of Venus [in Greek Aphrodite], of Minerva [in Greek  Pallas Athene, or either name separately], of Apollo [of  Phoebus], Diana [in Greek Artemis], and of Mercury [in Greek  Hermes], who are ranked among the twelve superior gods, and of  many inferior deities.  But Jupiter himself is not the original  deity in these systems.  He is the son of Saturnus, as in the  Greek Zeus is the son of Kronos.  Still the inevitable question  would occur where did Saturnus or Kronos come from.  And, in  forms and statements more and more vague, the answer was that he  was born from Uranus or Ouranos, which is the name of the Heaven  over all which seemed to embrace all things.  The Greek name of  Saturn was spelled Kronos.  The Greek name of Time was spelled  Chronos.  A similarity between the two was imagined.  And the  whole statement, when reduced to rationalistic language, would be  that from Uranus, the infinite, was born Chronos, Time,-- that  from Time, Zeus or Jupiter was born, and that he is the only  child of Time who has complete sway over mortals and immortals.      \"The will of Jove I own,    Who mortals and immortals rules alone.\"    Homer, II.xii    Jupiter was son of Saturn (Kronos) [The names included in  parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman or Latin  names] and Ops (Rhea in Greek, sometimes confounded with the  Phrygian Cybele).    Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were the children  of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we shall  give a further account in our next chapter.    In allusion to the dethronement of Ouranos by Kronos, and of  Kronos or Saturnus by Zeus or Jupiter, Prometheus says in  AEschylus's tragedy,--      \"You may deem    Its towers impregnable; but have I not    already seen two monarchs hurled from them.\"    Thee is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according  to which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings.  Love  (Eros)_ issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos.  By  his arrows and torch he pierced and vivified all things,  producing life and joy.    Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans.  There were others,  whose names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males;  and Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females.  They are spoken of as  the elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to  others.  Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion  to Apollo.  Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn.  He is therefore the original sun-god, and is painted with the  splendor and beauty which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo.    \"Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself.\"   Shakespeare    Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned  by Saturn and Rhea.  Milton alludes to them in Paradise Lost.  He  says the heathen seem to have had some knowledge of the  temptation and fall of man,--      \"And fabled how the serpent, whom they called    Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide-    Encroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule    Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven.\"    The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent, for  on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of  innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a  monster who devoured his own children [This inconsistency arises  from considering the Saturn of the Romans the same with the  Grecian deity Chronos (Time), which, as it brings an end to all  things which have had a beginning, may be said to devour its own  offspring.] Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and when grown  up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to  Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children.  Jupiter, with  his brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father  Saturn, and his brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and  imprisoned some of them in Tartarus, inflicting other penalties  on others.  Atlas was condemned to bear up the heavens on his  shoulders.    On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune  (Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions.  Jupiter's  portion was the heavens, Neptune's the ocean, and Pluto's the  realms of the dead.  Earth and Olympus were common property.  Jupiter was king of gods and men.  The thunder was his weapon,  and he bore a shield called AEgis, made for him by Vulcan.  The  eagle was his favorite bird, and bore his thunderbolts.    Juno (Hera)[pronounce He-re, in two syllables] was the wife of  Jupiter, and queen of the gods.  Iris, the goddess of the  rainbow, was her attendant and messenger.  The peacock was her  favorite bird.    Vulcan (Hephaistos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter  and Juno.  He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at  the sight of him that she flung him out of heaven.  Other  accounts say that Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his  mother, in a quarrel which occurred between them.  Vulcan's  lameness, according to this account, was the consequence of his  fall.  He was a whole day falling, and at last alighted in the  island of Lemnos, which was thenceforth sacred to him.  Milton  alludes to this story in Paradise lost, Book I.      \"From morn    To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,    A summer's day; and with the setting sun    Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,    On Lemnos, the AEgean isle.\"    Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno.  Phoebus Apollo [this is a Greek name of a Greek divinity, who  seems to have had no Roman resemblance], the god of archery,  prophecy, and music, was the son of Jupiter and Latona, and  brother of Diana (Artemis).  He was god of the sun, as Diana, his  sister, was the goddess of the moon.    Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the  daughter of Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from  the foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to  the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the  Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All were  charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for the service he had  rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So the most beautiful of the  goddesses became the wife of the most ill-favored of the gods.  Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called the Cestus, which  had the power of inspiring love.  Her favorite birds were swans  and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and the  myrtle.    Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus.  He was her  constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the  darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men.  There was  a deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the  avenger of slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of  reciprocal affection.  The following legend is told of him:--    Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a  child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and  that if he had a brother he would grow apace.  Anteros was soon  afterwards born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase  rapidly in size and strength.    Minerva (Pallas Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring  of Jupiter, without a mother.  She sprang from his head,  completely armed.  Her favorite bird was the owl, and the plant  sacred to her the olive.    Byron, in \"Childe Harold,\" alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:--      \"Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,    And freedom find no champion and no child,    Such as Columbia saw arise, when she    Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?    Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,    Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar    Of Cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled    On infant Washington?  Has earth no more    Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?\"    Mercury (Hermes), was the son of Jupiter and Maia.  He presided  over commerce, wrestling and other gymnastic exercises; even over  thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and  dexterity.  He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged  cap and winged shoes.  He bore in his hand a rod entwined with  two serpents, called the Caduceus.    Mercury is said to have invented the lyre.  Four hours after his  birth he found the shell of a tortoise, made holes in the  opposite edges of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and  the instrument was complete [From this origin of the instrument,  the word \"shell\" is often used as synonymous with :\"lyre,\" and  figuratively for music and poetry.  Thus Gray, in his ode on the  \"Progress of Poesy,\" says,-- \"O Sovereign of the willing soul,  Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! The  sullen Cares And Frantic Passions hear thy soft control.\"] The  cords were nine, in honor of the nine Muses.  Mercury gave the  lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the caduceus.    Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea.  She had a  daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of  Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead.  Ceres presided over  agriculture.    Bacchus (Dionysus)_, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and  Semele.  He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine,  but its social and beneficent influences likewise; so that he is  viewed as the promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover  of peace.    The muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory).  They presided over song, and prompted the memory.  They were nine  in number, to each of whom was assigned the presidency over some  particular department of literature, art, or science.  Calliope  was the muse of epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric  poetry, Melpomene of tragedy, Terpischore of choral dance and  song, Erato of love-poetry, Polyhymnia of sacred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33287"],[0,"Hints on the Use and Handling of Firearms Generally, and the Revolver in (#3)"],[1,", that in laying a gun the top of the  notch of the hindsight, the apex of the foresight, and the object, can  be brought into line as accurately with both eyes open as with one  closed.    An artilleryman can lay a gun perfectly without closing one eye. The  eyes should not be less than 12 inches from the hindsight, if from 2 to  3 feet so much the better, and a more accurate aim will be the result.    Upon the principle that the hand follows the eye, a sportsman fixing  both eyes upon his bird can take as perfect an aim as he could with one  eye closed.    This rule applies equally to all arms.    A man when in the field or at practice should keep his eyes about him;  he should remember whom he is with; that he may be covered by a friend's  gun or rifle at any moment, and that as the abominable and unnecessary  proceeding of carrying weapons loaded, when not actually in the field,  is the rule rather than the exception, he may perhaps find himself  accidentally pinked at any moment, and when he little expects it.    I remember some years ago the magnificent solemnity of a military  funeral was brought to a somewhat ludicrous termination by one of the  firing party shooting his comrade in the stern. How the accident really  occurred I never could learn; but it was a fact that the rear-rank man  managed somehow to discharge his rifle, and pretty nearly blow off the  tail of his comrade's tunic.    The wounded man, who was more frightened than hurt, seemed not at all to  relish the joke. An old lady came to the rescue.    This good old soul seems to have been in the habit of carrying a flask,  and, graciously offering the 'pocket pistol,' suggested a drop of the  creature. The offer was most readily accepted, but, I regret to say, the  terror of the injured man was so great that he emptied the flask. He had  evidently had enough of soldiering and 'villainous saltpetre,' for the  very next day he sent in his resignation.    At ball practice men should refrain from talking, joking, and that  ungentlemanly pastime known as _horse-play_. Their attention should be  directed to what they are about to do and what others are doing, and  they should leave frivolities for some other time.    Many accidents in the field have occurred when getting over stiles,  gates, hurdles, stone walls, and even through hedges.    Within the beautiful glades of Kensington Gardens stands a lasting  memorial.              IN MEMORY OF            SPEKE.            VICTORIA, NYANZA,            AND THE NILE.            1864.    Here is a terrible record of an awful death through carelessness. A  noble life lost, sacrificed in a moment. Poor Speke, who had faced death  often in many forms, met it at last by his own hand.    While out shooting, in getting through a hedge he dragged his  fowling-piece after him, the muzzle towards his own body, when, the lock  becoming entangled in the brambles, his immediate death was the result.  Such a piece of foolhardiness on the part of a man accustomed to the use  of firearms is astounding.    Use dulls the edge of caution, and some men, unhappily, who are  accustomed to deal constantly with weapons and ingredients of  destruction, become not only careless but indifferent and callous.    There is a class of men who, if not kept under surveillance, would  probably be found smoking their pipes in a powder-magazine, or while  sitting upon a barrel of gunpowder.    Men are too prone to carry their weapons at full-cock. This should never  be done. If alone, when getting through a hedge or over any  _impedimenta_ the weapon should be laid on the ground, parallel with the  hedge, if possible. After getting upon the other side, the weapon should  be drawn through with the butt end towards the person.    If you have a comrade or keeper with you, hand him the weapon, muzzle  up; get through yourself, and then take the weapons from him, _muzzle  up_, and he can follow you with safety. Always place your weapon upon  half-cock (it should never be at full-cock) before attempting to go  through a hedge or over a stile.    When two or more gentlemen take the field together, it is advantageous  to work the ground in the formation of echelon.    The whole field will by this means be thoroughly searched for game, and  each man can fire clear of the other, commanding his own ground and the  whole field within the range of the respective guns.    When about to commence practice with the rifle or revolver the firing  party should be placed well to the front, and should never load, or be  allowed to load, until all preliminaries are arranged, and the words,  'Ready! go on!' are given.    This command or caution will, of necessity, place every one upon his  guard.    When the piece is loaded, the finger with which the trigger is drawn  should on no account be placed within the trigger-guard till the weapon  is raised and the aim about to be taken; and with the rifle until the  weapon is presented, after being put upon full-cock.    In firing with a pistol, or revolver, the proper finger with which to  draw the trigger is the second finger, not the index finger, as  generally used. The index finger should be placed horizontally along the  barrel, on the side of the weapon, which is most important--which, as a  means of securing steadiness and leverage, tends not only to reduce the  difficulty of the pull, but also tends to prevent depression of the  muzzle, which is sure to take place if the forefinger is used,  particularly when the trigger has the minimum five-pounds' pull.    When a gun, rifle, pistol, or revolver, is at full-cock, and it is  desired to place it upon half-cock, as is often done, it should be so  altered, with great care, as follows:--    The hammer should be lowered gently to the full extent of the spring,  and should then be carefully drawn back till the distinct _click_ of the  half-cock is heard; then the weapon is as safe as an arm can be when  loaded, and cannot be accidentally discharged.    To place a weapon from full to half-cock, by not lowering the hammer to  the full extent of the spring, and then drawing it back to half-cock as  before described, is a most dangerous practice, as the hammer may not be  properly inserted in the clip, and an accident might be the result. A  man once having taken up his position at the firing-point, and having  loaded his piece, should never return into the company of his comrades  till his piece (particularly if a pistol or revolver) is discharged, or  till all its chambers have been expended. If it is necessary for him to  rejoin his comrades after his piece is loaded, or after any of the  chambers have been expended, he should leave the weapon behind him at  the firing-point, and should place it, _muzzle down_, in a hole or slot  purposely made in the table before him to receive it, which hole in the  table should have the word 'LOADED' written legibly near it.    If there is no table, then the weapon should, if at full-cock, be placed  upon half-cock, as before described, and then laid carefully upon the  ground, muzzle pointing towards the target, and slightly inclined to the  left thereof, so as to be clear of it, which will allow of the target  being examined, if necessary, without the examiner coming within the  direct line of fire of the weapon; but the table with a hole in it is  the safest method, and is recommended.    A couple of stakes with a rope from the firing-point to the target  should be used, as a precaution to keep back idle curiosity-seekers from  placing themselves within danger on the firing party's left.    No one should, upon any pretence whatever, place himself, or be allowed  to place himself, on, or even near, the firing party's left side. The  reason is obvious, as it will be found invariably in practice that a  man, when loading with a breech-loader, will naturally incline the  muzzle of his piece, and so innocently place those immediately upon his  left within its range.    If it is necessary to address a man when at the firing-point all  interlocution should be addressed to him on his right; so the Instructor  should place himself on the right and rather behind the practitioner,  and as close to him as convenient, so as not to incommode his freedom.    Some men are naturally nervous, particularly when at ball practice, and  for this reason all but novices should be left alone, as they will  perhaps make better scoring if not interfered with.    All spectators should take ground well in rear of the alignment of the  firing-point, and on its right flank. The practice of taking up weapons  and going through the pantomime of pointing them at the target, or  pointing a weapon at anything when not at actual practice, is idle, and  is to be condemned.    Weapons set aside for practice should never be meddled with.    The party who takes his turn (if firing with revolvers) should receive  his weapon unloaded, _muzzle up_, with the necessary amount of  ammunition, from the Instructor or Superintendent in charge; he should  then step to the front or firing-point, load his piece himself, and get  rid of his cartridges as quickly as a due regard to careful aim, &c.,  will admit; then return his piece, _muzzle up_, to the Instructor, who  will carefully examine it and satisfy himself that all the chambers have  been expended.    Should a revolver miss fire, it is most important that great caution  should be used, as it will sometimes '_hang fire_,' which the cartridges  of all weapons are liable to do at times.[A] When a cartridge does not  explode the revolver should be held in the same position as much as  possible, muzzle to the front, or downwards, for a few seconds; should  it not then explode it may be examined, the non-exploded cartridge  removed and condemned, and a new cartridge put in its place. On no  account should the condemned cartridge be placed with or near live  cartridges.    Firearms should never, under any pretence, be"]]]
