These extremes, however, are not often resorted to, for the natives are  usually content with simpler means, such as flaying a goat, instead of  a child, to be walked over; while, to prevent any evil approaching their  dwellings a squashed frog, or any other such absurdity, when place on  the track, is considered a specific.    How the negro has lived so many ages without advancing, seems  marvellous, when all the countries surrounding Africa are so forward in  comparison; and judging from the progressive state of the world, one  is led to suppose that the African must soon either step out from his  darkness, or be superseded by a being superior to himself. Could a  government be formed for them like ours in India, they would be saved;  but without it, I fear there is very little chance; for at present the  African neither can help himself nor will he be helped about by others,  because his country is in such a constant state of turmoil he has too  much anxiety on hand looking out for his food to think of anything  else. As his fathers ever did, so does he. He works his wife, sells his  children, enslaves all he can lay hands upon, and, unless when fighting  for the property of others, contents himself with drinking, singing, and  dancing like a baboon to drive dull care away. A few only make cotton  cloth, or work in wood, iron, copper, or salt; their rule being to do  as little as possible, and to store up nothing beyond the necessities of  the next season, lest their chiefs or neighbours should covet and take  it from them.    Slavery, I may add, is one great cause of laziness, for the masters  become too proud to work, lest they should be thought slaves themselves.  In consequence of this, the women look after the household work--such as  brewing, cooking, grinding corn, making pottery and baskets, and taking  care of the house and the children, besides helping the slaves whilst  cultivating, or even tending the cattle sometimes.    Now, descending to the inferior order of creation, I shall commence with  the domestic animals first, to show what the traveller may expect to  find for his usual support. Cows, after leaving the low lands near the  coast, are found to be plentiful everywhere, and to produce milk in  small quantities, from which butter is made. Goats are common all over  Africa; but sheep are not so plentiful, nor do they show such good  breeding--being generally lanky, with long fat tails. Fowls, much  like those in India, are abundant everywhere. A few Muscovy ducks are  imported, also pigeons and cats. Dogs, like the Indian pariah, are very  plentiful, only much smaller; and a few donkeys are found in certain  localities. Now, considering this good supply of meat, whilst all  tropical plants will grow just as well in central equatorial Africa  as they do in India, it surprises the traveller there should be any  famines; yet such is too often the case, and the negro, with these  bounties within his reach, is sometimes found eating dogs, cats, rats,  porcupines, snakes, lizards, tortoises, locusts, and white ants, or  is forced to seek the seeds of wild grasses, or to pluck wild herbs,  fruits, and roots; whilst at the proper seasons they hunt the wild  elephant, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, pigs, and antelopes; or, going out  with their arrows, have battues against the guinea-fowls and small  birds.    The frequency with which collections of villages are found all over the  countries we are alluding to, leaves but very little scope for the runs  of wild animals, which are found only in dense jungles, open forests,  or praires generally speaking, where hills can protect them, and near  rivers whose marshes produce a thick growth of vegetation to conceal  them from their most dreaded enemy--man. The prowling, restless  elephant, for instance, though rarely seen, leaves indications of his  nocturnal excursions in every wilderness, by wantonly knocking down the  forest-trees. The morose rhinoceros, though less numerous, are found in  every thick jungle. So is the savage buffalo, especially delighting in  dark places, where he can wallow in the mud and slake his thirst without  much trouble; and here also we find the wild pig.    The gruff hippopotamus is as widespread as any, being found wherever  there is water to float him; whilst the shy giraffe and zebra affect all  open forests and plains where the grass is not too long; and antelopes,  of great variety in species and habits, are found wherever man will  let them alone and they can find water. The lion is, however, rarely  heard--much more seldom seen. Hyenas are numerous, and thievishly  inclined. Leopards, less common, are the terror of the villagers. Foxes  are not numerous, but frighten the black traveller by their ill-omened  bark. Hares, about half the size of English ones--there are no  rabbits--are widely spread, but not numerous; porcupines the same. Wild  cats, and animals of the ferret kind, destroy game. Monkeys of various  kinds and squirrels harbour in the trees, but are rarely seen. Tortoises  and snakes, in great variety, crawl over the ground, mostly after the  rains. Rats and lizards--there are but few mice--are very abundant, and  feed both in the fields and on the stores of the men.    The wily ostrich, bustard, and florikan affect all open places. The  guinea-fowl is the most numerous of all game-birds. Partridges come  next, but do not afford good sport; and quails are rare. Ducks and snipe  appear to love Africa less than any other country; and geese and storks  are only found where water most abounds. Vultures are uncommon; hawks  and crows much abound, as in all other countries; but little birds, of  every colour and note, are discoverable in great quantities near water  and by the villages. Huge snails and small ones, as well as fresh-water  shells, are very abundant, though the conchologist would find but little  variety to repay his labours; and insects, though innumerable, are best  sought for after the rains have set in. [3]          The Wanguana or Freed Men    The Wa-n-guana, as their name implies, are men freed from slavery; and  as it is to these singular negroes acting as hired servants that I have  been chiefly indebted for opening this large section of Africa, a few  general remarks on their character cannot be out of place here.    Of course, having been born in Africa, and associated in childhood with  the untainted negroes, they retain all the superstitious notions of the  true aborigines, though somewhat modified, and even corrupted, by that  acquaintance with the outer world which sharpens their wits.    Most of these men were doubtless caught in wars, as may be seen every  day in Africa, made slaves of, and sold to the Arabs for a few yards  of common cloth, brass wire, or beads. They would then be taken to the  Zanzibar market, resold like horses to the highest bidder, and then kept  in bondage by their new masters, more like children of his family  than anything else. In this new position they were circumcised to make  Mussulmans of them, that their hands might be \"clean\" to slaughter their  master's cattle, and extend his creed; for the Arabs believe the day  must come when the tenets of Mohammed will be accepted by all men.    The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he  ever was in his life before, with this exception, that as a slave he  feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society, and his  family ties are all cut off from him--probably his relations have all  been killed in the war in which he was captured. Still, after the first  qualms have worn off, we find him much attached to his master, who feeds  him and finds him in clothes in return for the menial services which  he performs. In a few years after capture, or when confidence has been  gained by the attachment shown by the slave, if the master is a trader  in ivory, he will intrust him with the charge of his stores, and send  him all over the interior of the continent to purchase for him both  slaves and ivory; but should the master die, according to the Mohammedan  creed the slaves ought to be freed. In Arabia this would be the case;  but at Zanzibar it more generally happens that the slave is willed to  his successor.    The whole system of slaveholding by the Arabs in Africa, or rather on  the coast or at Zanzibar, is exceedingly strange; for the slaves, both  in individual physical strength and in numbers, are so superior to the  Arab foreigners, that if they chose to rebel, they might send the Arabs  flying out of the land. It happens, however, that they are spell-bound,  not knowing their strength any more than domestic animals, and they even  seem to consider that they would be dishonest if they ran away after  being purchased, and so brought pecuniary loss on their owners.    There are many positions into which the slave may get by the course of  events, and I shall give here, as a specimen, the ordinary case of one  who has been freed by the death of his master, that master having been a  trader in ivory and slaves in the interior. In such a case, the slave so  freed in all probability would commence life afresh by taking service  as a porter with other merchants, and in the end would raise sufficient  capital to commence trading himself--first in slaves, because they are  the most easily got, and then in ivory. All his accumulations would then  go to the Zanzibar market, or else to slavers looking out off the coast.  Slavery begets slavery. To catch slaves is the first thought of every  chief in the interior; hence fights and slavery impoverish the land, and  that is the reason both why Africa does not improve, and why we find men  of all tribes and tongues on the coast.

But  Yankee Jim had got Ranald to the door and was whispering to him. \"Run!\"  cried Yankee Jim, pushing him out of the door, and the boy was off like  the wind. LeNoir pursued him a short way and returned raging.    Yankee Jim, or Yankee, as he was called for short, came back to  Macdonald Dubh's side, and whispering to the other Highlanders, \"Keep  your backs clear,\" sat up coolly on the counter. The fight was sure to  come and there were seven to one against them in the room. If he could  only gain time. Every minute was precious. It would take the boy fifteen  minutes to run the two miles to camp. It would be half an hour before  the rest of the Glengarry men could arrive, and much fighting may be  done in that time. He must avert attention from Macdonald Dubh, who was  waiting to cram LeNoir's insult down his throat. Yankee Jim had not  only all the cool courage but also the shrewd, calculating spirit of  his race. He was ready to fight, and if need be against odds, but he  preferred to fight on as even terms as possible.    Soon LeNoir came back, wild with fury, and yelling curses at the top of  his voice. He hurled himself into the room, the crowd falling back from  him on either hand.    \"Hola!\" he yelled, \"Sacre bleu!\" He took two quick steps, and springing  up into the air he kicked the stovepipe that ran along some seven feet  above the floor.    \"Purty good kicking,\" called out Yankee, sliding down from his seat.  \"Used to kick some myself. Excuse ME.\" He stood for a moment looking up  at the stovepipe, then without apparent effort he sprang into the air,  shot up his long legs, and knocked the stovepipe with a bang against the  ceiling. There was a shout of admiration.    \"My damages,\" he said to Pat Murphy, who stood behind the counter. \"Good  thing there ain't no fire. Thought it was higher. Wouldn't care to kick  for the drinks, would ye?\" he added to LeNoir.    LeNoir was too furious to enter into any contest so peaceful, but as he  specially prided himself on his high kick, he paused a moment and was  about to agree when Black Hugh broke in, harshly, spoiling all Yankee's  plans.    \"There is no time for such foolishness,\" he said, turning to Dan Murphy.  \"I want to know when we can get our timber out.\"    \"Depinds intoirly on yirsilf,\" said Murphy.    \"When will your logs be out of the way?\"    \"Indade an' that's a ha-r-r-d one,\" laughed Murphy.    \"And will you tell me what right hev you to close up the river?\" Black  Hugh's wrath was rising.    \"You wud think now it wuz yirsilf that owned the river. An' bedad it's  the thought of yir mind, it is. An' it's not the river only, but the  whole creation ye an yir brother think is yours.\" Dan Murphy was close up  to Macdonald Dubh by this time. \"Yis, blank, blank, yir faces, an' ye'd  like to turn better than yirsilves from aff the river, so ye wud, ye  black-hearted thaves that ye are.\"    This, of course, was beyond all endurance. For answer Black Hugh smote  him sudden and fierce on the mouth, and Murphy went down.    \"Purty one,\" sang out Yankee, cheerily. \"Now, boys, back to the wall.\"    Before Murphy could rise, LeNoir sprang over him and lit upon Macdonald  like a cat, but Macdonald shook himself free and sprang back to the  Glengarry line at the wall.    \"Mac an' Diabboil,\" he roared, \"Glengarry forever!\"    \"Glengarry!\" yelled the four Highlanders beside him, wild with the  delight of battle. It was a plain necessity, and they went into it with  free consciences and happy hearts.    \"Let me at him,\" cried Murphy, struggling past LeNoir towards Macdonald.    \"Non! He is to me!\" yelled LeNoir, dancing in front of Macdonald.    \"Here, Murphy,\" called out Yankee, obligingly, \"help yourself this way.\"  Murphy dashed at him, but Yankee's long arm shot out to meet him, and  Murphy again found the floor.    \"Come on, boys,\" cried Pat Murphy, Dan's brother, and followed by half a  dozen others, he flung himself at Yankee and the line of men standing up  against the wall. But Yankee's arms flashed out once, twice, thrice, and  Pat Murphy fell back over his brother; two others staggered across and  checked the oncoming rush, while Dannie Ross and big Mack Cameron had  each beaten back their man, and the Glengarry line stood unbroken.  Man for man they were far more than a match for their opponents, and  standing shoulder to shoulder, with their backs to the wall, they  taunted Murphy and his gang with all the wealth of gibes and oaths at  their command.    \"Where's the rest of your outfit, Murphy?\" drawled Yankee. \"Don't seem's  if you'd counted right.\"    \"It is a cold day for the parley voos,\" laughed Big Mack Cameron. \"Come  up, lads, and take a taste of something hot.\"    Then the Murphy men, clearing away the fallen, rushed again. They strove  to bring the Highlanders to a clinch, but Yankee's voice was high and  clear in command.    \"Keep the line, boys! Don't let 'em draw you!\" And the Glengarry men  waited till they could strike, and when they struck men went down and  were pulled back by their friends.    \"Intil them, bhoys!\" yelled Dan Murphy, keeping out of range himself.  \"Intil the divils!\" And again and again his men crowded down upon the  line against the wall, but again and again they were beaten down or  hurled back bruised and bleeding.    Meantime LeNoir was devoting himself to Black Hugh at one end of the  line, dancing in upon him and away again, but without much result. Black  Hugh refused to be drawn out, and fought warily on defense, knowing the  odds were great and waiting his chance to deliver one good blow, which  was all he asked.    The Glengarry men were enjoying themselves hugely, and when not shouting  their battle-cry, \"Glengarry forever!\" or taunting their foes, they were  joking each other on the fortunes of war. Big Mack Cameron, who held the  center, drew most of the sallies. He was easy-tempered and good-natured,  and took his knocks with the utmost good humor.    \"That was a good one, Mack,\" said Dannie Ross, his special chum, as a  sounding whack came in on Big Mack's face. \"As true as death I will be  telling it to Bella Peter. Bella, the daughter of Peter McGregor, was  supposed to be dear to Big Mack's heart.    \"What a peety she could not see him the now,\" said Finlay Campbell. \"Man  alive, she would say the word queeck!\"    \"'Tis more than she will do to you whatever, if you cannot keep off that  crapeau yonder a little better,\" said Big Mack, reaching for a Frenchman  who kept dodging in upon him with annoying persistence. Then Mack began  to swear Gaelic oaths.    \"'Tain't fair, Mack!\" called out Yankee from his end of the line, \"bad  language in English is bad enough, but in Gaelic it must be uncommon  rough.\" So they gibed each other. But the tactics of the enemy were  exceedingly irritating, and were beginning to tell upon the tempers of  the Highlanders.    \"Come to me, ye cowardly little devil,\" roared Mack to his persisting  assailant. \"No one will hurt you! Come away, man! A-a-ah-ouch!\" His cry  of satisfaction at having grabbed his man ended in a howl of pain, for  the Frenchman had got Mack's thumb between his teeth, and was chewing it  vigorously.    \"Ye would, would you, ye dog?\" roared Big Mack. He closed his fingers  into the Frenchman's gullet, and drew him up to strike, but on every  side hands reached for him and stayed his blow. Then he lost himself.  With a yell of rage he jambed his man back into the crowd, sinking his  fingers deeper and deeper into his enemy's throat till his face grew  black and his head fell over on one side. But it was a fatal move  for Mack, and overcome by numbers that crowded upon him, he went down  fighting wildly and bearing the Frenchman beneath him. The Glengarry  line was broken. Black Hugh saw Mack's peril, and knew that it  meant destruction to all. With a wilder cry than usual, \"Glengarry!  Glengarry!\" he dashed straight into LeNoir, who gave back swiftly,  caught two men who were beating Big Mack's life out, and hurled them  aside, and grasping his friend's collar, hauled him to his feet, and  threw him back against the wall and into the line again with his grip  still upon his Frenchman's throat.    \"Let dead men go, Mack,\" he cried, but even as he spoke LeNoir, seeing  his opportunity, sprang at him and with a backward kick caught Macdonald  fair in the face and lashed him hard against the wall. It was the  terrible French 'lash' and was one of LeNoir's special tricks. Black  Hugh, stunned and dazed, leaned back against the wall, spreading out his  hands weakly before his face. LeNoir, seeing victory within his grasp,  rushed in to finish off his special foe. But Yankee Jim, who, while  engaged in cheerfully knocking back the two Murphys and others who took  their turn at him, had been keeping an eye on the line of battle, saw  Macdonald's danger, and knowing that the crisis had come, dashed across  the line, crying \"Follow me, boys.\" His long arms swung round his head  like the sails of a wind-mill, and men fell back from him as if they had  been made of wood. As LeNoir sprang, Yankee shot fiercely at him, but  the Frenchman, too quick for him, ducked and leaped upon Black Hugh, who  was still swaying against the wall, bore him down and jumped with his  heavy \"corked\" boots on his breast and face. Again the Glengarry line  was broken. At once the crowd surged about the Glengarry men, who now  stood back to back, beating off the men leaping at them from every side,  as a stag beats off dogs, and still chanting high their dauntless cry,  \"Glengarry forever,\" to which Big Mack added at intervals, \"To hell with  the Papishes!\" Yankee, failing to check LeNoir's attack upon Black Hugh,  fought off the men crowding upon him, and made his way to the corner  where the Frenchman was still engaged in kicking the prostrate  Highlander to death.    \"Take that, you blamed cuss,\" he said, catching LeNoir in the"]]]
