At sixty-one guineas, gentlemen; lot number  127 is going--a rare bargain for somebody--going! Will nobody try  another guinea on this magnifi----Thank _you_, sir! That's a little  better, gentlemen. Seventy guineas I think you said, sir?\"--this to  the man in the kennel-coat, who had returned from his visit to the  back of the crowd.    The ferret-faced dealer who had bid sixty-one guineas now turned  his back on the ring; and, as he heard the cry of seventy guineas,  the Master moved slowly forward among the crowd toward the door of  the building. He dared not offer more, and he could not wait to see  Tara led out of the ring by some stranger. He paused a moment,  without looking up, and heard the auctioneer's \"Going, going,  gone!\" Then he walked to the entrance of the main hall, to escape  from the scene of so grievous a disappointment.    Outside, in the main building, while moodily filling a pipe, the  Master decided that, whatever happened, he must find out who had  purchased Tara in order that he might put in a word for his dear  old friend, and thereby, it might be, ensure more consideration for  her in her new home. There were one or two little whims and  peculiarities of hers which he must explain. He thought of pretty  Mrs. Forsyth and her broken pledge regarding Tara. He looked along  the dusty, littered hall, and, in the distance, saw an elderly lady  leading an Irish Wolfhound. A moment later, and he recognized the  hound as Tara, and the lady as a good friend of his own, a kindly,  wealthy Yorkshire woman who had bought two whelps of him before he  left the country, and with whom he had corresponded since. He had  visited this lady, too, to help her in the matter of some doggy  trouble of hers. Now she was walking directly toward him, leading  Tara, and smiling and nodding to him. Just then the lady leaned  forward and unsnapped Tara's chain. In an instant, the great hound  bounded forward to greet her well-loved friend, the Master,  furiously nuzzling his hands, and finally standing erect to reach  his face, a paw on either shoulder, her soft eyes glistening,  brimming over with canine love and delight. The man's eyes were not  altogether dry, either, as he muttered and growled affectionate  nonsense in Tara's silky ears. His heart swelled as he felt the  tremulous excitement in the great hound's limbs.    \"You see, dear old Tara cannot be deceived; she knows her real  friends,\" said the lady from Yorkshire, as she shook hands with the  Master. \"Please take her chain, and never give any one else the  right to handle it. You will allow me this pleasure, I am sure, if  only because of the love I bear Tara's son.\" (One of the whelps  this lady had bought from him was a son of Tara.) \"I know Mrs.  Forsyth quite well--a whimsical, fanciful little person, who takes  up a new fad every month, and is apt to change her pets as often as  her gloves. I could not possibly let a stranger buy the beautiful  mother of my Dhulert, and it gives me so much real pleasure to be  the means of bringing her to your hands again.\"    This good woman bowed her silvery head when the Master took her  hand in his, because she had caught a glimpse of what glistened in  his eyes, as he tried to give words to the gratitude that filled a  heart already swelled by another emotion inspired by Tara.    They walked all the way home, the Master and Tara; and twice they  made considerable detours (despite the distance still before them),  for the sake of spending a few minutes in open spaces, where there  was grass--smutty and soiled it is true, but grass--and comparative  solitude. In these places they exchanged remarks, and Tara placed a  little London mud on each of the Master's shoulders, and he made  curious noises in his throat, such as Tara had been wont to  associate with early morning scampers in an upland orchard, after  rabbits.    At last they came to the \"mansions,\" and made great show of  creeping along close to the railing, and dodging quickly in at the  entrance to avoid being overlooked from the windows above. As a  matter of fact tenants of the flats in these buildings were not  supposed to keep dogs at all, while the idea of an Irish Wolfhound,  thirty-two inches high the shoulder!---- But it was little the  Master cared that night. The meeting between Tara and the Mistress  of the Kennels was a spectacle which afforded him real joy. The  flat seemed ridiculously tiny when once Tara was inside it; but,  like all her race, this mother of heroes was a marvel of deftness,  and could walk in and out of the Mistress's little drawing-room  without so much as brushing a chair-leg. There was great rejoicing  in the little flat that night; and a deal of wonderful planning,  too, I make no doubt.    And this was how Tara, the mother of heroes, returned to the  friends who had watched over her birth and early training, and  later motherhood, with every sort of loving care.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER II    IN THE BEGINNING      It was little that Tara, the Wolfhound, cared about lack of space,  so that she could stretch her great length along a hearthrug, with  her long, bearded muzzle resting on her friend's slippers, and gaze  at him, while he sat at his work, through the forest of overhanging  eyebrows which screened her soft, brown eyes. And in any case, the  next four months of her life, after the happy meeting at the Show  which restored her to her old friend, were too full of changing  happenings and variety of scene and occupation to leave time for  much consideration about the size of quarters, and matters of that  like.    For one thing, it was within a few days of the show that Tara was  taken on a two days' visit to a farm in Oxfordshire, where she  renewed her old acquaintance with one of the greatest aristocrats  of her race, Champion Dermot Asthore, the father of those great  young hounds she had given to the world during her life with the  Master; the children whose subsequently earned champion honours  reflected glory upon herself as the most famous living mother of  her breed, though not the most famous show dog. The qualities which  win the greatest honour in the show ring are not always the  qualities which make for famous motherhood. As a show hound merely,  Tara might have been beaten by dames of her race who had not half  her splendid width of flank and chest and general massiveness,  though they might have a shade more than her height and raciness.    After that, something considerable seemed to happen pretty well  every day. The Master spoke laughingly of the spring madness that  was as quicksilver to his heels, and of great profit to furniture  removers. He laughed a good deal in those early spring days, and  took Tara and the Mistress of the Kennels with him on quite a  number of journeys from Victoria railway station. Tara heard much  talk of Sussex Downs, and when she came to scamper over them, found  herself in thorough agreement with every sort of joyous encomium  she heard passed upon them. Then there came a day of extraordinary  confusion at the little flat, when men with aprons stamped about  and turned furniture upside down, and made foolish remarks about  Tara, as she sat beside the writing-table gravely watching them.  That night Tara slept in a loose box in the stable of a country  inn, and in the early morning went out for a glorious run on the  Downs with the Master, who seemed to have grown younger since they  left London.    Within a very few days from this time, Tara and her friends had  settled down comfortably in a new home. An oddly-shaped little  house it was, full of unexpected angles and doors, and having a  garden and orchard which straggled up the lower slope of one of the  Downs. It had a stable, too, of a modest sort, and rather poky, but  the coach-house was admirable, light, airy, facing south-east, and  having a new concrete floor, which the Master helped to lay with  his own hands. The back half of this coach-house consisted of a  slightly raised wooden dais; a very pleasant place for a Wolfhound  to lie, when spring sunshine was flooding the coach-house. But Tara  did not spend much of her time there, for between the stabling and  the house there was a big wooden structure with a tiled roof, large  as a good-sized barn, but with an entrance like an ordinary  house-door, and comfortably matchboarded inside, like a wooden house.  A pleasant old villager who was doing some work in the garden  referred to this place as \"th'old parish room,\" but the Master  made it his own den, lined one of its sides with books, and  pictures of dogs and men, and fields and kennels. He had his big  writing-table established there, with a sufficiency of chairs, a  few rugs upon the forty-feet length of floor, and an old couch upon  one side, manufactured by himself with the aid of an ancient spring  mattress, a few blocks of wood, a big 'possum-skin rug which some  friend had sent him from Australia, and a variety of cushions. The  actual house, for all its rambling shape, was small, and possibly  this was why the Master chose to utilize this outside place as his  den, and to fix a big stove in it for heating. Here, too, at one  end, and just beyond the big writing-table, was a raised wooden  dais or bed, like that in the coach-house, a good six feet square,  with sides to it, perhaps six inches high. Tara watched the making  of this dais, and saw the master cover its floor with a kind of  sawdust that had a strong, pleasant smell, and then nail down a  tightly stretched piece of old carpet over that, making altogether,  as she thought, a very excellent bed. And as such Tara used it by  night, but in the daytime she usually preferred to stretch herself  beside the writing-table, or on the rug by the door, where the  sunshine formed a pool of light and warmth on a fine morning.    Here it was that Tara took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#3)"],[1,"  beware of reckless assertions of personal preference. The first  question, in the presence of an elaborate work of music, should never  be, \"Do I like it or not?\" but \"Do I understand it?\" \"Is the music  conveying a logical message to me, or is it merely a sea of sound?\"  The first and last article in the music-lover's creed, I repeat,  should be _familiarity_. When we thoroughly know a symphony, symphonic  poem or sonata so that, for example, we can sing the themes to  ourselves, the music will reveal itself. The difference between the  trained listener and the person of merely general musical tendencies  is that the former gains a definite meaning from the music often at a  first hearing; whereas, to the latter, many hearings are necessary  before he can make head or tail of the composition. Since the creative  composer of music is a thinker in tones, our perceptions must be so  trained that, as we listen, we make sense of the fabric of sounds and  rhythms.    [Footnote 7: From earliest times, mothers have doubtless crooned to  their infants in instinctive lullabies.]    It is evident from the foregoing observations that our approach to the  subject is to be on the intellectual side. Music, to be sure, is an  emotional art and so appeals to our emotions, but these will take care  of themselves. We all have a reasonable supply of emotion and  practically no human being is entirely deficient in the capacity for  being moved by music. We can, however, sharpen our wits and strengthen  our musical memories; for it is obvious that if we cannot recognize a  theme or remember it whenever it appears, often in an amplified or  even subtly disguised form, we are in no condition to follow and  appreciate the logical growth and development of the themes themselves  which, in a work of music, are just as real beings as the \"dramatis  personae\" in a play. The would-be appreciator should early recognize  the fact that listening to music is by no means passive, a means of  light amusement or to pass the time, but demands cooperation of an  active nature. Whether or not we have the emotional capacity of a  creator of music may remain an open question; but by systematic mental  application we _can_, as we listen to it, get from the music that  sense which the composer meant to convey. Music--more than the other  arts--demands, to use a happy expression of D.G. Mason, that we  \"mentally organize our sensations and ideas\"; for the language of  music has no such fixed grammar as verbal modes of expression, and the  message, even when received, is suggestive rather than definite. In  this way only can the composition be recreated in our imaginations.  For acquiring this habit of mind, this alertness and concentration,  the start, as always, is more than half the battle. Schumann's good  advice to young composers may be transferred to the listener: \"Be sure  that you invent a thoroughly vital theme; the rest will grow of itself  from this.\" Likewise in listening to music, one should be sure to  grasp the opening theme, the fundamental motive, in order to follow it  intelligently and to enjoy its subsequent growth into the complete  work.[8]    [Footnote 8: In this connection we cannot refrain from suggesting the  improvement which should be made in the concert manners of the public.  How often, at the beginning of a concert, do we see people removing  their wraps, looking at their neighbors, reading the programme book,  etc., instead of concentrating on the music itself; with the result  that the composition is often well on its way before such people have  found their bearings.]    Every piece of music, with the exception of intentionally rhapsodic  utterances, begins with some group of notes of distinct rhythmic and  melodic interest, which is the germ--the generative force--of the  whole, and which is comparable to the text of a sermon or the subject  of a drama. This introductory group of notes is called, technically, a  _motive_ or moving force and may be defined as _the simplest unit of  imaginative life in terms of rhythm and sound_, which instantly  impresses itself upon our consciousness and, when heard several times,  cannot be forgotten or confused with any other motive. A musical  theme--a longer sweep of thought (to be explained later)--may consist  of several motives of which the first is generally the most important.  Just here lies the difference between the Heaven-born themes of a  truly creative composer and the bundle of notes put forth by lesser  men. These living themes pierce our imaginations and sing in our  memories, sometimes for years, whereas the inept and flabby tunes of  certain so-called composers make no strong impression and are  forgotten almost as soon as heard. Motives obviously differ from each  other in regard to the intervals of the tones composing them, _i.e._,  the up and down relationship in pitch, the duration of the tones and  their grouping into metric schemes. But a real motive is always terse,  concise, characteristic and pregnant with unrevealed meaning. The  chief glory of such creative tone-poets as Beethoven, Wagner, Brahms  and Franck is that their imaginations could give birth to musical  offspring that live for ever and are loved like life itself. The first  step, then, in the progress of the appreciator of music is the  recognition of the chief motive or motives of a composition and the  development of power to follow them in their organic growth. This  ability is particularly necessary in modern music: for frequently all  four movements of a symphony or string-quartet are based upon a motive  which keeps appearing--often in altered form and in relationships  which imply a dramatic or suggestive meaning. A few of such motives  are cited herewith, taken from works with which, as we proceed, we  shall become familiar.    [Music: CESAR FRANCK: _Symphony in D minor_]    [Music: BRAHMS: _First Symphony in C minor_]    [Music: TCHAIKOWSKY: _5th Symphony_]    [Music: DVO[VR]AK: Symphony _From the New World_]    It is now necessary for the student to know something about the  constructive principles by which large works of music are fashioned;  not so much that he could compose these works himself, even if he had  the inspiration, but to know enough, so that the reception of the  music is not a haphazard activity but an intellectual achievement,  second only to that of the original creator. Every genuine work of art  in whatever medium, stone, color, word or tone, must exhibit _unity of  general effect with variety of detail_. That is, the material must  hold together, be coherent and convince the participant of the logical  design of the artist; not fall apart as might a bad building, or be  diffuse as a poorly written essay. And yet, with this coherence, there  must always be stimulating and refreshing variety; for a too constant  insistence on the main material produces intolerable monotony, such as  the \"damnable iteration\" of a mediocre prose work or the harping away  on one theme by the hack composer. In no art more than music is this  dual standard of greater importance, and in no art more difficult to  attain. For the raw material of music, fleeting rhythms and waves of  sound, is in its very nature most incoherent. Here we are not dealing  with the concrete, tangible and definite material which is available  for all the other arts, but with something intangible and elusive. We  know from the historical record[9] of musical development, that, only  after centuries of experimentation conducted by some of the best  intellects in Europe, was sufficient coherence gained so that there  could be composed music which would compare with the simplest modern  hymn-tune or part-song. And this was long after each of the other  arts--architecture, sculpture, painting and literature--had reached  points of attainment which, in many respects, have never since been  equalled.    [Footnote 9: Compare Parry's _Evolution of the Art of Music_, passim  and D.G. Mason's _Beethoven and his Forerunners_, Chapter I.]    Before carrying our inquiries further, something must be said about  the two main lines of musical development which led up to music as we  know it to-day. These tendencies are designated by the terms  _Homophonic_ and _Polyphonic_. By homophonic,[10] from Greek words  signifying a \"single voice,\" is meant music consisting of a _single_  melodic line, as in the whole field of folk-songs (which originally  were always unaccompanied) or in the unison chants of the Greeks and  the Gregorian tones of the early church, in which there is _one  melody_ though many voices may unite in singing it. Later we shall see  what important principles for the growth of instrumental music were  borrowed from the instinctive practise associated with the folk-song  and folk-dance. But history makes clear that the fundamental  principles of musical coherence were worked out in the field of music  known as the _Polyphonic_. By this term, as the derivation implies, is  meant music the fabric of which is made by the interweaving of  _several_ independent melodies. For many centuries the most reliable  instrument was the human voice and the only art-music, _i.e._, music  which was the result of conscious mental and artistic endeavor, was  vocal music for groups of unaccompanied voices in the liturgy of the  church. About the tenth century, musicians tried the crude  experiment,[11] called Organum, of making two groups of singers move  in parallel fifths _e.g._,    [Music: Tu Patris sempiternus es Filius.]    but during the 13th and 14th centuries a method was worked out by  which the introductory tune was made to generate its own subsequent  tissue. It was found that a body of singers could announce a melody of  a certain type and that, after they had proceeded so far, a second set  of singers could repeat the opening melodic phrase--and so likewise  often a third and a fourth set--and that all the voices"]]]
