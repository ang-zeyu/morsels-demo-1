[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#3)"],[1,"a huge  band of chosen young men, for ornament and glory in peace, for security  and defence in war. Nor is it amongst his own people only, but even from  the neighbouring communities, that any of their Princes reaps so  much renown and a name so great, when he surpasses in the number and  magnanimity of his followers. For such are courted by Embassies, and  distinguished with presents, and by the terror of their fame alone often  dissipate wars.    In the day of battle, it is scandalous to the Prince to be surpassed in  feats of bravery, scandalous to his followers to fail in matching the  bravery of the Prince. But it is infamy during life, and indelible  reproach, to return alive from a battle where their Prince was slain.  To preserve their Prince, to defend him, and to ascribe to his glory all  their own valorous deeds, is the sum and most sacred part of their oath.  The Princes fight for victory; for the Prince his followers fight. Many  of the young nobility, when their own community comes to languish in  its vigour by long peace and inactivity, betake themselves through  impatience in other States which then prove to be in war. For,  besides that this people cannot brook repose, besides that by perilous  adventures they more quickly blazon their fame, they cannot otherwise  than by violence and war support their huge train of retainers. For from  the liberality of their Prince, they demand and enjoy that _war-horse_  of theirs, with that _victorious javelin_ dyed in the blood of their  enemies. In the place of pay, they are supplied with a daily table and  repasts; though grossly prepared, yet very profuse. For maintaining such  liberality and munificence, a fund is furnished by continual wars and  plunder. Nor could you so easily persuade them to cultivate the ground,  or to await the return of the seasons and produce of the year, as  to provoke the foe and to risk wounds and death: since stupid and  spiritless they account it, to acquire by their sweat what they can gain  by their blood.    Upon any recess from war, they do not much attend the chase. Much more  of their time they pass in indolence, resigned to sleep and repasts. All  the most brave, all the most warlike, apply to nothing at all; but to  their wives, to the ancient men, and to even the most impotent domestic,  trust all the care of their house, and of their lands and possessions.  They themselves loiter. Such is the amazing diversity of their nature,  that in the same men is found so much delight in sloth, with so much  enmity to tranquillity and repose. The communities are wont, of their  own accord and man by man, to bestow upon their Princes a certain number  of beasts, or a certain portion of grain; a contribution which passes  indeed for a mark of reverence and honour, but serves also to supply  their necessities. They chiefly rejoice in the gifts which come from the  bordering countries, such as are sent not only by particulars but in the  name of the State; curious horses, splendid armour, rich harness, with  collars of silver and gold. Now too they have learnt, what we have  taught them, to receive money.    That none of the several people in Germany live together in cities, is  abundantly known; nay, that amongst them none of their dwellings are  suffered to be contiguous. They inhabit apart and distinct, just as a  fountain, or a field, or a wood happened to invite them to settle. They  raise their villages in opposite rows, but not in our manner with the  houses joined one to another. Every man has a vacant space quite round  his own, whether for security against accidents from fire, or that they  want the art of building. With them in truth, is unknown even the use of  mortar and of tiles. In all their structures they employ materials  quite gross and unhewn, void of fashion and comeliness. Some parts  they besmear with an earth so pure and resplendent, that it resembles  painting and colours. They are likewise wont to scoop caves deep in the  ground, and over them to lay great heaps of dung. Thither they retire  for shelter in the winter, and thither convey their grain: for by such  close places they mollify the rigorous and excessive cold. Besides  when at any time their enemy invades them, he can only ravage the  open country, but either knows not such recesses as are invisible and  subterraneous; or must suffer them to escape him, on this very account  that he is uncertain where to find them.    For their covering a mantle is what they all wear, fastened with a clasp  or, for want of it, with a thorn. As far as this reaches not they  are naked, and lie whole days before the fire. The most wealthy are  distinguished with a vest, not one large and flowing like those of  Sarmatians and Parthians, but girt close about them and expressing the  proportion of every limb. They likewise wear the skins of savage beasts,  a dress which those bordering upon the Rhine use without any fondness or  delicacy, but about which such who live further in the country are more  curious, as void of all apparel introduced by commerce. They choose  certain wild beasts, and, having flayed them, diversify their hides with  many spots, as also with the skins of monsters from the deep, such as  are engendered in the distant ocean and in seas unknown. Neither does  the dress of the women differ from that of the men, save that the  women are orderly attired in linen embroidered with purple, and use no  sleeves, so that all their arms are bare. The upper part of their breast  is withal exposed.    Yet the laws of matrimony are severely observed there; for in the whole  of their manners is aught more praiseworthy than this: for they are  almost the only Barbarians contented with one wife, excepting a very few  amongst them; men of dignity who marry divers wives, from no wantonness  or lubricity, but courted for the lustre of their family into many  alliances.    To the husband, the wife tenders no dowry; but the husband, to the wife.  The parents and relations attend and declare their approbation of the  presents, not presents adapted to feminine pomp and delicacy, nor such  as serve to deck the new married woman; but oxen and horse accoutred,  and a shield, with a javelin and sword. By virtue of these gifts, she  is espoused. She too on her part brings her husband some arms. This they  esteem the highest tie, these the holy mysteries, and matrimonial Gods.  That the woman may not suppose herself free from the considerations of  fortitude and fighting, or exempt from the casualties of war, the very  first solemnities of her wedding serve to warn her, that she comes to  her husband as a partner in his hazards and fatigues, that she is to  suffer alike with him, to adventure alike, during peace or during war.  This the oxen joined in the same yoke plainly indicate, this the horse  ready equipped, this the present of arms. 'Tis thus she must be content  to live, thus to resign life. The arms which she then receives she must  preserve inviolate, and to her sons restore the same, as presents worthy  of them, such as their wives may again receive, and still resign to her  grandchildren.    They therefore live in a state of chastity well secured; corrupted by no  seducing shows and public diversions, by no irritations from banqueting.  Of learning and of any secret intercourse by letters, they are all  equally ignorant, men and women. Amongst a people so numerous, adultery  is exceeding rare; a crime instantly punished, and the punishment left  to be inflicted by the husband. He, having cut off her hair, expells her  from his house naked, in presence of her kindred, and pursues her with  stripes throughout the village. For, to a woman who has prostituted her  person, no pardon is ever granted. However beautiful she may be, however  young, however abounding in wealth, a husband she can never find. In  truth, nobody turns vices into mirth there, nor is the practice of  corrupting and of yielding to corruption, called the custom of the Age.  Better still do those communities, in which none but virgins marry, and  where to a single marriage all their views and inclinations are at once  confined. Thus, as they have but one body and one life, they take  but one husband, that beyond him they may have no thought, no further  wishes, nor love him only as their husband but as their marriage.  To restrain generation and the increase of children, is esteemed an  abominable sin, as also to kill infants newly born. And more powerful  with them are good manners, than with other people are good laws.    In all their houses the children are reared naked and nasty; and thus  grow into those limbs, into that bulk, which with marvel we behold.  They are all nourished with the milk of their own mothers, and never  surrendered to handmaids and nurses. The lord you cannot discern from  the slave, by any superior delicacy in rearing. Amongst the same cattle  they promiscuously live, upon the same ground they without distinction  lie, till at a proper age the free-born are parted from the rest, and  their bravery recommend them to notice. Slow and late do the young men  come to the use of women, and thus very long preserve the vigour of  youth. Neither are the virgins hastened to wed. They must both have  the same sprightly youth, the like stature, and marry when equal and  able-bodied. Thus the robustness of the parents is inherited by the  children. Children are holden in the same estimation with their mother's  brother, as with their father. Some hold this tie of blood to be most  inviolable and binding, and in receiving of hostages, such pledges are  most considered and claimed, as they who at once possess affections  the most unalienable, and the most diffuse interest in their family.  To every man, however, his own children are heirs and successors: wills  they make none: for want of children his next akin inherits; his own  brothers, those of his father, or those of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#3)"],[1," Data.--Yukon River, Alaska, June  28, 1902. Nest of rubbish on an island; found by a miner.      11. RED-THROATED LOON. _Gavia stellata._    Range.--Northern parts of North America, breeding from southern Canada  northward in the interior on both coasts. South to the middle portions  of the United States in winter.    This is the smallest of the Loon family, being twenty-five inches in  length. In plumage it is wholly unlike any of the other members at all  seasons of the year. In summer the back, head and neck are gray, the  latter being striped with white. A large chestnut patch adorns the front  of the lower part of the neck. In winter the back is spotted with white,  whereas all the others are unspotted at this period. The nesting habits  are identical with the other species; the ground color of the two eggs  is also the same. Size 2.00 x 1.75.    [Illustration 021: Pacific Loon.

This nest is built on top of a Muskrat house.]    Page 21    PUFFINS, AUKS and MURRES.  Family ALCIDAE    Puffins, Auks and Murres are all sea birds and are only found inland  when blown there by some severe storm of winter. At this season numbers  of them are apt to lose their bearings and may sometimes be found with  their feet frozen in some of our inland ponds. Puffins are heavily built  birds in appearance, but are very active both on the wing and in the  water. Their wings are much larger comparatively than those of the other  members of this family, so they are enabled to perform evolutions in the  air, which are withheld from the others. They stand upright on the sole  of the foot and are able to walk quite easily on land. Puffins have very  heavy and deep but thin bills, which are entirely unlike those of any  other bird and often give then the name of Parrot Auks. Puffins, Auks  and Murres are otherwise recognized by the presence of but three toes  which are webbed.    [Illustration 023: NEST AND EGGS OF PIED-BILLED GREBE.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 22    12. TUFTED PUFFIN. _Lunda cirrhata._    Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska southward to southern California,  breeding locally throughout their range.    Tufted Puffins are the largest of the Puffins. In the breeding plumage,  they are a sooty brownish or black color; the cheeks are white, and a  long tuft of straw colored feathers extends back from each eye; the bill  is bright red and greenish yellow. They breed commonly on the  Farallones, where two or three broods are raised by a bird in a single  season, but much more abundantly on the islands in the north. Their  single eggs are laid in burrows in the ground or else in natural  crevices formed by the rocks. The eggs are pure white or pale buff and  are without gloss. They very often have barely perceptible shell  markings of dull purplish color. The eggs are laid about the middle of  June. Size 2.80 x 1.90. Data.--Farallone Is., May 27, 1887. Single egg  laid in crevice of rocks. Collector, W. O. Emerson.      13. PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica arctica._    Range.--North Atlantic Coast, breeding from the Bay of Fundy northward.  Winters from breeding range along the New England Coast.    The common Puffin has the cheeks, chin and underparts white; upper parts  and a band across the throat, blackish. Bill deep and thin, and colored  with red, orange and yellow. They breed in large numbers on Bird Rock in  the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The nest is either among the natural crevices  of the    [Illustration 024: Tufted Puffin. Puffin.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 23    rocks, or in burrows excavated in the ground by the birds. These burrows  vary in length from two and a half to four or five feet. Except upon the  positive knowledge of the absence of the bird, it is a hazardous thing  to put the hand in one of these burrows for the bird can, and will nip  the fingers, sometimes to the bone. They lay but a single egg, usually  dull white and unmarked, but in some cases obscurely marked with reddish  brown. Size 2.50 x 1.75. Data.--So. Labrador, June 23, 1884. Single egg  laid at end of burrow in the ground. Collector, J. H. Jameson.      13a. LARGE-BILLED PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica naumanni._    A more northerly subspecies of the last, inhabiting the Arctic region on  the Atlantic side. The bird is somewhat larger but otherwise  indistinguishable from the common species. The eggs are exactly the same  or average a trifle larger. Size 2.55 x 1.80. Data.--Iceland, July 6,  1900. Single egg in hole under a rock. Collector, Chas. Jefferys.      14. HORNED PUFFIN. _Fratercula corniculata._    Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to British Columbia. The Horned Puffin  differs from the common in that the blackish band across the throat  extends upwards in a point to the bill. Their nesting habits are  precisely the same as those of the preceding species. A single pure  white egg is laid; the shell is slightly rougher than those of the  others. Size 2.65 x 1.80. Data.--Round Is., Alaska, June 24, 1884.  Single egg laid at end of burrow in ground; no nest. Collector, G. L.  Kennedy.      15. RHINOCEROS AUKLET. _Cerorhinca monocerata._    Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from British Columbia northward and  wintering southward to Lower California.    The Rhinoceros Auklet or Horned Auk has a much smaller bill than the  Puffins; in the summer this is adorned at the base by a horn from which  it takes its name. There are also slender plumes from above and below  the eyes. Unlike the Puffins, these birds sit upon their whole tarsus.    They nest on islands of the North Pacific Coast from Vancouver  northward. A single egg is laid in crevices among the rocks or in  burrows in the ground. It is similar both in size and shape to that of  the Puffins, but is often quite heavily blotched with brown. Size 2.70 x  1.80. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska, June 30, 1900. Egg laid in a fissure of  the rocks; no nest. Collector, F. Weston.    [Illustration 025: White.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 24    16. CASSIN AUKLET. _Ptychoramphus aleuticus._    Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to Lower California, breeding nearly  throughout its range.    A plain appearing bird about 9 in. in length, with blackish upperparts  relieved only by a white spot over the eye; breast and throat gray and  belly white. This Auklet is fairly abundant on the Farallones, breeding  on the lower portions of the island. The late Mr. C. Barlow says that it  is found in deserted rabbit burrows and in all probability often  excavates its own burrows. It also nests among the cliffs placing its  eggs among the rocks in any crevice or tunnel which may offer a dark  retreat during the day for they are nocturnal in their habits. The  single egg which they lay is dull white in color, the inside of the  shell being a pale green, which color can only be seen by holding the  egg to the light. They are generally slightly nest stained. Size 1.80 x  1.30. Data.--Coronado Islands, Cal., March 23, 1897. Single egg laid on  the bare ground at end of a burrow three and one-half feet long.  Collector, E. A. Shives.    [Illustration 026: Horned Puffin. Rhinoceros Auklet. Cassin Auklet.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]  [Illustration: RHINOCEROS AUKLET. Color white, sometimes heavily  blotched, as above, and again unspotted.]    Page 25    17. PAROQUET AUKLET.--_Phaleris psittacula._    Range.--The Alaskan Coast, casually farther south in winter.    This bird is about the same size as the preceding, and the plumage is  similar, except that it has no white spot over the eye, and the breast  is white. It also has a slender plume extending from back of the eye.  The bill is very peculiar, being quite deep and rounded and having an  upward tendency. It is orange red in color. They breed very commonly on  the islands of Bering Strait. Their eggs are laid in the crevices of the  cliff, often several feet in and by a crooked path so that it is  impossible to reach them. The single chalky white egg is laid in May.  Size 2.30 x 1.45. Data.--Rocky Islet in the Aleutians, June 22, 1890.  Single egg laid on bare rock in a deep crevice. Collector, Capt. S.  Wilson.      18. CRESTED AUKLET. _Aethia cristatella._    Range.--Alaska Coast, similar in form and plumage to the latter, except  that the whole under parts are gray and it has a crest of recurved  feathers. The nesting season begins in May, the birds nesting upon the  same islands and in the same kinds of sites as the last species. The  single egg is chalky white. Size 2.10 x 1.50. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska,  July 1, 1900. Egg laid in a crevice among the rocks. Collector, F.  Weston.      19. WHISKERED AUKLET. _Aethia pygmaea._    Range.--The Alaska Coast.    Much smaller than the preceding; but 7.5 in. in length. Breast gray,  belly white; a small tuft of recurved feathers on the forehead and  slender white plumes from base of bill over the eye and from under the  eye, backwards. The bill in summer is a bright vermillion color. On some  of the islands of the Aleutian chain they breed quite abundantly. The  nests are placed back in the crevices of the rocks, where the single  white eggs are laid. Size 2.00 x 1.25.    [Illustration 027: Paroquet Auklet. Crested Auklet.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 26    20. LEAST AUKLET. _Aethia pusilla._    Range.--North Pacific on the islands and coast of Alaska. This is the  smallest of the Auklets; length 6.5 in. This species has no crest, but  has the slender white plumes extending back from the eye. The entire  under parts are white sparsely spotted with dusky. This species is by  far the most abundant of the water birds of the extreme Northwest, and  thousands of them, accompanied by the two preceding species,"]]]
