Tyndall looked out into the garden: the sun was  beginning to set, the long shadows stretched across the dim recesses of  tropic greenery. The huge insect-like thing was still there, stretched  out in a narrow strip of sunlight, catching the last failing waves of  warmth from the sinking sun.    Tyndall turned to the Arrillian. \"Where might I find the priestess  Lhyreesa?\" he asked.    \"There, Dheb Tyn-Dall.\"    \"I see no one. Where do you say?\"    Bheel pointed. \"There, Dheb Tyn-Dall, where I point, you see the  priestess Lhyreesa taking the late afternoon sun ... unless your  eyesight is exceedingly bad, Dheb Tyn-Dall, you cannot fail to see....\"    Tyndall's eyesight was exceedingly good. He followed that pointing  finger, past the pillar that supported the roof of the patio, past the  first row of alien green plants, past the second and third rows, to the  clearing, to the little patch of sunlight, to the thing lying there.  That monstrous, misshapen Bug.... The Bug.... The Priestess Lhyreesa!    Tyndall felt a pounding, skull-shattering madness closing in on him.  This was a joke, of course. No, no joke. A dream then? No, not that  either. In only a few split seconds it happened. Tyndall had leapt the  rail around the patio, and was streaking through the Grove, heading for  its outer boundary. The city--if he could get out of the Grove, there  would be places to hide in the city. Narrow streets, empty cellars, dim,  dim alleys. They'd never find him there! Run now, run before he was  overtaken!    But he was not being pursued. Bheel still stood on the patio, transfixed  with horror. He heard the Arrillian's terrified cry \"Dheb Tyn-Dall...!\"  And then a rope shot out and grabbed him by the ankles. Not a rope  really, a green something, and there were others around his arms, his  chest, his hips, wrapping him in their sticky green embrace. The  Guardians! He tried to cry out but one of the verdant fronds enveloped  his throat so tightly he could not utter a sound. The innocent green  things of the Grove were vigilant guardians indeed. They seemed to be  merely holding him immobile, but Tyndall realized with sick horror that  their pressure was increasing, so little at a time, but so steadily.    And something was happening out there in the sunlight too. The creature  had convulsively grasped the branch of a bush and was clinging weakly to  it, great tremors wracking its body. It seemed to be struggling,  suffering, dying ... even as he was. In his agony, Tyndall laughed.    \"A Time! A Time!\" The voice came from the patio. Tyndall saw Bheel throw  himself face down on the floor, covering his eyes with his hands. He  heard the cry echoed within the palace, and then like a mighty roar  outside in the city. And then there was silence, silence broken only by  the sound of his own breathing as he dragged his tortured lungs across  his shattered ribs.    He saw the Bug give a great heave, and then it seemed to split open, the  entire skin splitting in a dozen places and a hand ... A HAND reached  from within that dying hulk and grasped the bush to which it clung. A  white slender hand on a fragile wrist, and then the arm was free, a  woman's arm, a beautiful arm.    Tyndall began, dimly, and too late, to understand.    A leg kicked free ... the slender ankle ... the amply fleshed thigh.    Tyndall clung to consciousness doggedly. The Guardian was crushing the  last dregs of life out of him now, and even the pain seemed to recede.  His mind was very, very clear. So that was it. A word once heard in a  long forgotten classroom, and then the scientists of the expedition.  Metamorphosis ... he had meant to ask them what ... but he remembered  now ... what it meant. A passing from one form into another.... Had he  failed a biology test once because he didn't know what metamorphosis  meant ... dimly ... dimly ... he saw ...    The last thing Tyndall ever saw was the Priestess Lhyreesa as she  stepped out of the empty hulk, kicking it away with a disdainful toe.  Breathless from her ordeal, she sank to the grass, her breasts heaving  with exhaustion.    She sat there for a few minutes in the sunlight, then she tossed her  head and spread her long raven hair out on her shoulders, the better to  dry it in the waning sun.

The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or  asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel surfaces)  but may include closed or abandoned installations. Airports or  airfields that are no longer recognizable (overgrown, no facilities,  etc.) are not included. Note that not all airports have accommodations  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways:  This entry gives the total number of  airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length.  For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is  included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2)  2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)  under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this  listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,  or air traffic control.    Airports - with unpaved runways:  This entry gives the total number of  airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces)  by length. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest  runway is included according to the following five groups - (1) over  3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523  m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included  in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,  maintenance, or air traffic control.    Appendixes:  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area:  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of  all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the  surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or  rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.    Area - comparative:  This entry provides an area comparison based on  total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US  or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)  provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are  compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in  Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).    Background:  This entry usually highlights major historic events and  current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future  trends.    Birth rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of births  during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also  known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant  factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both  the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.    Budget:  This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital  expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Capital:  This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its  geographic coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if  applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where  appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those countries  that have multiple time zones.    Central bank discount rate:  This entry provides the annualized  interest rate a country's central bank charges commercial, depository  banks for loans to meet temporary shortages of funds.    Climate:  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather  regimes throughout the year.    Coastline:  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between  the land area (including islands) and the sea.    Commercial bank prime lending rate:  This entry provides a simple  average of annualized interest rates commercial banks charge on new  loans, denominated in the national currency, to their most credit-  worthy customers.    Communications:  This category deals with the means of exchanging  information and includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet  host entries.    Communications - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous  communications information of significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution:  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,  and major amendments.    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):  UTC is the international atomic time  scale that serves as the basis of timekeeping for most of the world.  The hours, minutes, and seconds expressed by UTC represent the time of  day at the Prime Meridian (0 deg. longitude) located near Greenwich,  England as reckoned from midnight. UTC is calculated by the Bureau  International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM  averages data collected from more than 200 atomic time and frequency  standards located at about 50 laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis  for all civil time with the Earth divided into time zones expressed as  positive or negative differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to as  \"Zulu time.\" See the Standard Time Zones of the World map included with  the Reference Maps.    Country data codes:  see Data codes.    Country map:  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in  color. The maps were produced from the best information available at  the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed  subsequently.    Country name:  This entry includes all forms of the country's name  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an  example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional short  form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form  (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also  see the Terminology note.    Crude oil:  See entry for oil.    Current account balance:  This entry records a country's net trade in  goods and services, plus net earnings from rents, interest, profits,  and dividends, and net transfer payments (such as pension funds and  worker remittances) to and from the rest of the world during the period  specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Data codes:  This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-  Reference List of Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference  List of Hydrographic Data Codes.    Date of information:  In general, information available as of 1 January  2007 was used in the preparation of this edition.    Daylight Saving Time (DST):  This entry is included for those entities  that have adopted a policy of adjusting the official local time  forward, usually one hour, from Standard Time during summer months.  Such policies are most common in mid-latitude regions.    Death rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths  during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude  death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the  mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current  mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly  affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a  rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in  mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging  population.    Debt - external:  This entry gives the total public and private debt  owed to nonresidents repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Dependency status:  This entry describes the formal relationship  between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas:  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all  nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular  independent state.    Diplomatic representation:  The US Government has diplomatic relations  with 189 independent states, including 187 of the 192 UN members  (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US  itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 2  independent states that are not in the UN, the Holy See and Kosovo, as  well as with the EU.    Diplomatic representation from the US:  This entry includes the chief  of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX  number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and  consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation in the US:  This entry includes the chief of  mission, chancery, telephone, FAX, consulate general locations, and  consulate locations.    Disputes - international:  This entry includes a wide variety of  situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to  unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding  disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has  been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other  situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as  resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;  however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index:  This index measures the  degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country.  The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative  family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from  the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area  between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b)  the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly  equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to  the 45 degree"]]]
