Fact is,  Mrs. Mulligan, Jim has--\"    \"There's nothin' happened to Jim, has there?\" she interrupted.    \"Nothing at all, madam, nothing at all,\" said Hetherington. \"The work  was a little too much for him to-day--that's all--and he keeled over.  He's safe, and comfortable in the--well, they took him to the hospital,  but don't you worry--he'll be all right in a day or two, and meanwhile  I'm going to look after you and the kiddies.\"    The chauffeur placed the basket inside the door.    \"You'll find a small turkey, and some--er--some fixings in it, Mrs.  Mulligan,\" said Hetherington. \"Whatever ought to go with a turkey should  be there, and--er--have the kiddies gone to bed?\"    \"Poor little souls, they have,\" said the woman.    \"Well, just you tell 'em for me,\" said Hetherington, \"that Santa Claus  received little Mary's letter, will you, please? And--er--and if they  don't mind a very late call like this, why I'd like to see them.\"    The woman looked anxiously into Hetherington's eyes for a moment, and  then she tottered and sat down.    \"You're sure there's nothin' the matter with Jim, sir?\" she asked.    \"Absolutely, Mrs. Mulligan,\" Hetherington answered. \"It's exactly as I  have told you. The cold and hunger were too much for him, but he's all  right, and I'll guarantee to have him back here inside of forty-eight  hours.\"    \"I'll call the childer,\" said Mrs. Mulligan.    Two wide-eyed youngsters shortly stood in awed wonder before their  strange visitor, never doubting for a moment that he was Santa Claus  himself.    \"How do you do, Miss Mulligan?\" said Hetherington, with a courtly bow to  the little tot of a girl. \"I received your letter this afternoon, and  was mighty glad to hear from you again, but I've been too busy all day  to write you in return, so I thought I'd call and tell you that it's all  right about those shoes, and the hat, and the new doll-baby, and the  things for Jimmie. Fact is, I've brought 'em with me. Reginald,\" he  added, turning to the chauffeur, who stood grinning in the doorway,  \"just unfasten that bundle of shoes, will you, while I get Jimmie's new  mitts and the base-ball bat?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the chauffeur, suiting his action to the orders, and  with a right good will that was pleasant to see.    \"Reginald is my assistant,\" said Santa Claus. \"Couldn't get along  without Reginald these days--very busy days they are--so many new  kiddies in the world, you know. There, Jimmie--there's your bat. May you  score many a home-run with it. Here's a ball, too--good thing to have a  ball to practise with. Some day you'll be a Giant, perhaps, and help win  the pennant. Incidentally, James, old boy, there's a box of tin  soldiers in this package, a bag of marbles, a select assortment of tops,  and a fur coat; just try that cap on, and see if you can tell yourself  from a Brownie.\"    The children's eyes gleamed with joy, and Jimmie let out a cheer that  would have aroused the envy of a college man.    \"You didn't mention it in your note, Mary, dear,\" continued Santa Claus,  turning to the little girl, \"but I thought you might like to cook a few  meals for this brand-new doll-baby of yours, so I brought along a little  stove, with a few pots and pans and kettles and things, with a small  china tea-set thrown in. This ought to enable you to set her up in  housekeeping; and then when you go to school I have an idea you'll find  this little red-riding-hood cloak rather nice--only it's navy blue  instead of red, and it looks warm.\"    [Illustration: She stood with her eyes popping out of her head.  _Page_ 39.]    Hetherington placed the little cloak with its beautiful brass buttons  and its warm hood over the little girl's shoulders, while she stood with  her eyes popping out of her head, too delightedly entranced to be able  to say a word of thanks.    \"Don't forget this, sir,\" said the chauffeur, handing Hetherington a  package tied up in blue ribbons.    \"And finally,\" said Hetherington, after thanking Reginald for the  reminder, \"here is a box of candy for everybody in the place. One for  Mary, one for Jimmie, one for mother, and one for popper when he comes  home.\"    \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!\" cried the little girl, throwing  herself into Hetherington's arms. \"I knowed you'd come--I did, I did, I  did!\"    \"You believed in old Santa Claus, did you, babe?\" said Hetherington,  huskily, as the little girl's warm cheek pressed against his own.    \"Yes, I did--always,\" said the little girl, \"though Jimmie didn't.\"    \"I did so!\" retorted Jimmie, squatting on the floor and shooting a glass  agate at a bunch of miggles across the room. \"I swatted Petey Halloran  on the eye on'y yesterday for sayin' they wasn't no such person.\"    \"And you did well, my son,\" said Hetherington. \"The man or boy that says  there isn't any Santa Claus is a--is a--well, never you mind, but he is  one just the same.\"    And bidding his little friends good night, Hetherington, with the  chauffeur close behind him, left them to the joys of the moment, with a  cheerier dawn than they had known for many weary days to follow.      V    \"Good night, sir,\" said the chauffeur, as Hetherington paid him off and  added a good-sized tip into the bargain. \"I didn't useter believe in  Santa Claus, sir, but I do now.\"    \"So do I,\" said Hetherington, as he bade the other good night and  lightly mounted the steps to his house.          A MERRY CHRISTMAS PIE          Take a quart of pure Good Will,        Flavor well with Sympathy;      Boil it on the fire till        It is full of bubbling Glee.      Season with a dash of Cheer,        Mixed with Love and Tenderness;      Cool off in an atmosphere        That is mostly Kindliness.        Stick a dozen raisins in        Made of grapes from Laughter's vine,      And such fruits as you may win        In a purely Jocund line.      Make a batter from the cream        Of Good Spirits running high,      And you'll have a perfect dream        Of a Merry Christmas pie!          THE CHILD WHO HAD EVERYTHING BUT--      I    I knew it was coming long before it got there. Every symptom was in  sight. I had grown fidgety, and sat fearful of something overpoweringly  impending. Strange noises filled the house. Things generally, according  to their nature, severally creaked, soughed and moaned. There was a  ghost on the way. That was perfectly clear to an expert in uncanny  visitations of my wide experience, and I heartily wished it were not.  There was a time when I welcomed such visitors with open arms, because  there was a decided demand for them in the literary market, and I had  been able to turn a great variety of spooks into anywhere from three  thousand to five thousand words apiece at five cents a word, but now the  age had grown too sceptical to swallow ghostly reminiscence with any  degree of satisfaction. People had grown tired of hearing about Visions,  and desired that their tales should reek with the scent of gasoline,  quiver with the superfervid fever of tangential loves, and crash with  moral thunderbolts aimed against malefactors of great achievement and  high social and commercial standing. Wherefore it seemed an egregious  waste of time for me to dally with a spook, or with anything else, for  that matter, that had no strictly utilitarian value to one so  professionally pressed as I was, and especially at a moment like  that--it was Christmas morning and the hour was twenty-eight minutes  after two--when I was so busy preparing my Ode to June, and trying to  work out the details of a midsummer romance in time for the market for  such productions early in the coming January.    And right in the midst of all this pressure there rose up these beastly  symptoms of an impending visitation. At first I strove to fight them  off, but as the minutes passed they became so obsessively intrusive that  I could not concentrate upon the work in hand, and I resolved to have  it over with.    \"Oh, well,\" said I, striking a few impatient chords upon my typewriting  machine, \"if you insist upon coming, come, and let's have done with it.\"    I roared this out, addressing the dim depths of the adjoining apartment,  whence had risen the first dank apprehension of the uncanny something  that had come to pester me.    \"This is my busy night,\" I went on, when nothing happened in response to  my summons, \"and I give you fair warning that, however psychic I may be  now, I've got too much to do to stay so much longer. If you're going to  haunt, haunt!\"    It was in response to this appeal that the thing first manifested  itself to the eye. It took the shape first of a very slight veil of  green fog, which shortly began to swirl slowly from the darkness of the  other room through the intervening portieres into my den. Once within,  it increased the vigor of its swirl, until almost before I knew it there  was spinning immediately before my desk something in the nature of a  misty maelstrom, buzzing around like a pin-wheel in action.    \"Very pretty--very pretty indeed,\" said I, a trifle sarcastically,  refusing to be impressed, \"but I don't care for pyrotechnics. I  suppose,\" I added flippantly, \"that you are what might be called a  mince-pyrotechnic, eh?\"    Whether it was the quality of my jest, or some other inward pang due to  its gyratory behavior, that caused it I know not, but as I spoke a deep  groan issued from the centre of the whirling mist, and then out of its  indeterminateness there was resolved the hazy figure of an angel--only,  she was an intensely modern angel. She wore a hobble-skirt instead of  the usual flowing robes of ladies of the supernal order, and her halo,  instead of hovering over her head as used to be the correct manner of  wearing these hard-won adornments, had perforce become a mere golden  fillet binding together the great mass of finger-curls and other  distinctly yellow capillary attractions that stretched out from the"]]]
