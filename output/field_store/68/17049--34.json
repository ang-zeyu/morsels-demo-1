BY THE SKIN.--Although a number of drugs, notably mercury, are so readily  absorbed by the skin of cattle as to render poisoning easy, medicines are  not given in this way for their general or constitutional but only for  their local effect.    Diseases of the skin and superficial parasites are treated or destroyed by  applications in the forms of washes, ointments, dips, and powders.  Liniments and lotions are applied to the skin for the relief of some  near-lying part, such as a muscle, tendon, or joint. Blisters are applied  to the skin for the purpose of obtaining the effect of counterirritation  upon a neighboring region or organ. Cold water may be applied to the skin  to reduce the temperature and to diminish congestion or inflammation in a  superficial area or to reduce the temperature of the whole body. High fever  and heat strokes are treated in this way.    BY THE TISSUE BENEATH THE SKIN.--Hypodermic or subcutaneous injections are  often made for the purpose of introducing a drug, reagent, or vaccine  directly into the connecting tissue beneath the skin. Introduced in this  way, the substance is quickly absorbed, none of it is lost, and its whole  effect is obtained, often within a few minutes.    There are numerous precautions necessary in making a subcutaneous  injection, most of which have to do with cleansing and sterilization. It is  also important to select a proper site for the injection, so that blood  vessels, joints, and superficial nerves, organs, or cavities may all be  avoided. With due regard for the necessary precautions, there is  practically no danger in such an injection, but it should be attempted only  by those who are able to carry it through in a surgically clean way. Only  certain drugs can be given subcutaneously, and dosage must be accurately  graduated.    BY THE VEINS.--Certain medicines act most promptly and surely when  introduced directly into the blood by injecting them into a vein, usually  the jugular. Some vaccines and antitoxins are administered in this way.  Intravenous injection should be practiced only by experienced  veterinarians.          DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.    By A. J. MURRAY, M. R. C. V. S.    [Revised by R.W. HICKMAN, V. M. D.]      CHARACTER OF FEEDS AND FEEDING.    Diseases of the digestive organs are very common among cattle, and may  often be traced to defects in feeding. The first three stomachs of the  larger ruminants hold the feed for a long time, during which period it is  subjected to macerating, mixing, and straining processes in preparation for  entrance into the fourth or true stomach. The straining is accomplished  through the medium of the manyplies or book, while the paunch, or rumen,  with its adjunct, the waterbag, is concerned in the macerating, kneading,  and mixing, as well as in regurgitation for rumination or the chewing of  the cud. The action of the first three stomachs is merely preparatory to  digestion. Thus it would seem that as a result of their complex anatomical  and functional arrangement the feed of the ox, when of good quality and  wholesome, is in the most favorable condition possible for the digestive  process when it reaches the fourth stomach, where true digestion first  takes place. The location and arrangement of the stomachs are shown in  Plates I and II.    If the feed is of improper character, or is so given that it can not be  cared for by the animal in a normal way, false fermentations arise, causing  indigestion, and possibly, later, organic disease. In feeding cattle there  are a number of important considerations apart from the economy of the  ration, and some of these are noted below.    Feeds must not be damaged by exposure to the weather, by frost, by molds,  or by deleterious fermentations.    Damaged feeds retard or prevent digestion, and sometimes they contain or  cause to be generated substances that irritate the digestive tract, or are  distinctly poisonous to the animal. For example, hay that was rained on  severely during curing has not only lost a part of its nutritive value  through a washing-out process, but what remains is not so readily available  as in good hay. Roots that have been frozen are likely to irritate and  injure the digestive tract. Grass eaten with frost on it may cause severe  indigestion. All moldy feeds are not injurious, for some molds appear to  have no influence on the process of digestion, but those of other species  may not only retard digestion and cause local injury to the digestive  organs, but may cause general poisoning of a severe and fatal type.    The following molds have been shown (Dammann) to be dangerous in respect to  the production of the morbid conditions enumerated:    _Tilletia caries_ grows chiefly in wheat and may be found with the grain,  thus appearing in the bran or meal. It causes paralysis of the throat and  spinal cord and irritation of the digestive tract. The rusts, such as  _Puccinia graminis_, _P. straminis_, _P. Coronata_, and _P. arudinacea_,  cause colic and diarrhea, and in some cases partial paralysis of the  throat. The rusts that occur on clovers, beans, and peas cause very severe  irritation of the lining membrane of the mouth and throat, resulting  sometimes in gangrene of this tissue.    _Polydesmus exitans_ grows on the leaves of rape and turnips, appearing in  early summer. This fungus is very irritating to the mouths and feet of  cattle, causing severe inflammation and the formation of a false membrane.  In some instances this condition has been mistaken for foot-and-mouth  disease, but it can be differentiated by the absence of the blister that  is characteristic of that disease and by the further fact that it is  nontransmissible.    _Polytrincium trifolii_, which grows on clover, causing it to become black,  causes severe irritation of the stomach and intestines of cattle feeding  upon it.    Feeds must not contain too large a proportion of woody fiber or of  indigestible substances. If the dry matter ingested or the bulk of the feed  is very great on account of the small proportion of digestible matter, it  is impossible for the great mass to be moistened properly with and attacked  by the digestive juices. In consequence of this, abnormal fermentations  arise, causing indigestion and irritation of the digestive organs. On the  other hand, a ration too concentrated, and especially too rich in protein,  is not suitable, because, after a meal, the animal must have a certain  feeling of fullness in order to be comfortable and quiet, and the digestive  organs require a relatively large volume of contents to fill them to the  point where secretion is properly stimulated and their activity is most  efficient. If too much protein is in the ration there is a waste of  expensive feed, and the tendency is for the animal to become thin. It is  evident that a cow can not thrive on concentrated feeds alone, even though  these contain in assimilable form all the nutritive materials needed for  perfect support. It is because bulk is necessary that the standard of about  25 pounds of dry matter per cow per day has been reached by experimenters.  There is no objection to feeding grain or meal separately to a cow,  provided enough bulky feed is fed at another time in the day to keep the  digestive tract sufficiently distended.    In changing the ration, and especially in making radical changes, as at the  beginning and the end of the pasturing season, the change should be made  gradually, so that the digestive organs may accommodate themselves to it.  After the digestive organs and juices have from long practice become  adjusted to the digestion of a certain feed, which is then suddenly  withheld and another of quite different character and properties is  substituted, the second feed is not well digested; it may even irritate the  digestive canal. It is often observed that cattle lose from 25 to 100  pounds when turned on pasture from dry stable feed. This loss can readily  be prevented by not shocking the digestive organs by a sudden change of  diet.    Regularity in feeding has much to do with the utilization of the ration,  and gross irregularity may cause indigestion and serious disease.    Water for live stock should be as free from contamination and as nearly  pure as that used for household purposes. When practicable it is well to  warm the water in the winter to about 50 deg. F. and allow cattle to drink  often.      DISEASES OF THE MOUTH.    WOUNDS AND CONTUSIONS OF THE LIPS, AND SNAKE BITE.    The lips may become inflamed from contusions, which are sometimes produced  by a blow from the horns of another animal, or, in the case of working  oxen, by a blow from the driver. While cattle are grazing, more especially  when they are in woods, they may be bitten in the lips by insects or  serpents.    _Symptoms._--As a result of a contusion the lips become thick and swollen,  and if treatment is neglected the swelling may become hard and indurated,  or an abscess may form. This condition renders it difficult for the animal  to get food into its mouth, on account of the lips having lost their  natural flexibility. In such cases an ox will use his tongue more in the  prehension of food to make up for the incapacity of the lips. In cases of  snake bite the swelling is soft or puffy and its limits are not well  defined.    _Treatment._--When we have to deal with a bruise, the affected part should  be bathed with hot water two or three times daily. In recent cases no other  treatment will be required, but if the swelling is not recent and has  become hard or indurated, then the swollen part should be treated each day  by painting it with tincture of iodin. In snake bite a straight incision  penetrating into the flesh or muscle should be made across the center of  the swelling and in the direction of the long axis of the face.

There is a tendency among many scholars of  the present day to regard the policy of the British toward their  North American colonies as possibly unwise and blundering but as being  entirely in accordance with the legal and constitutional rights of the  mother country, and to believe that the Americans, while they may have  been practically and therefore morally justified in asserting their  independence, were still technically and legally in the wrong. It is  immaterial whether or not that point of view is accepted, for its mere  recognition is sufficient to explain the existence of a large number of  Americans who were steadfast in their support of the British side of the  controversy. Indeed, it has been estimated that as large a proportion  as one-third of the population remained loyal to the Crown. Numbers must  remain more or less uncertain, but probably the majority of the people  in the United States, whatever their feelings may have been, tried to  remain neutral or at least to appear so; and it is undoubtedly true  that the Revolution was accomplished by an aggressive minority and that  perhaps as great a number were actively loyal to Great Britain.    These Loyalists comprised at least two groups. One of these was a  wealthy, property-owning class, representing the best social element in  the colonies, extremely conservative, believing in privilege and  fearing the rise of democracy. The other was composed of the royal  officeholders, which included some of the better families, but was more  largely made up of the lower class of political and social hangers-on,  who had been rewarded with these positions for political debts incurred  in England. The opposition of both groups to the Revolution was  inevitable and easily to be understood, but it was also natural that  the Revolutionists should incline to hold the Loyalists, without  distinction, largely responsible for British pre-Revolutionary policy,  asserting that they misinformed the Government as to conditions and  sentiment in America, partly through stupidity and partly through  selfish interest. It was therefore perfectly comprehensible that the  feeling should be bitter against them in the United States, especially  as they had given efficient aid to the British during the war. In  various States they were subjected to personal violence at the hands of  indignant \"patriots,\" many being forced to flee from their homes, while  their property was destroyed or confiscated, and frequently these acts  were legalized by statute.    The historian of the Loyalists of Massachusetts, James H. Stark, must  not be expected to understate the case, but when he is describing,  especially in New England, the reign of terror which was established to  suppress these people, he writes:    \"Loyalists were tarred and feathered and carried on rails, gagged and  bound for days at a time; stoned, fastened in a room with a fire and the  chimney stopped on top; advertised as public enemies, so that they would  be cut off from all dealings with their neighbors; they had bullets  shot into their bedrooms, their horses poisoned or mutilated; money or  valuable plate extorted from them to save them from violence, and on  pretence of taking security for their good behavior; their houses and  ships burned; they were compelled to pay the guards who watched them in  their houses, and when carted about for the mob to stare at and abuse,  they were compelled to pay something at every town.\"    There is little doubt also that the confiscation of property and the  expulsion of the owners from the community were helped on by people who  were debtors to the Loyalists and in this way saw a chance of  escaping from the payment of their rightful obligations. The \"Act for  confiscating the estates of certain persons commonly called absentees\"  may have been a measure of self-defense for the State but it was passed  by the votes of those who undoubtedly profited by its provisions.    Those who had stood loyally by the Crown must in turn be looked out for  by the British Government, especially when the claims of justice were  reinforced by the important consideration that many of those with  property and financial interests in America were relatives of  influential persons in England. The immediate necessity during the war  had been partially met by assisting thousands to go to Canada--where  their descendants today form an important element in the population and  are proud of being United Empire Loyalists--while pensions and gifts  were supplied to others. Now that the war was over the British were  determined that Americans should make good to the Loyalists for all that  they had suffered, and His Majesty's Commissioners were hopeful at least  of obtaining a proviso similar to the one relating to the collection of  debts. John Adams, however, expressed the prevailing American idea  when he said that \"paying debts and compensating Tories\" were two very  different things, and Jay asserted that there were certain of these  refugees whom Americans never would forgive.    But this was the one thing needed to complete the negotiations for  peace, and the British arguments on the injustice and irregularity of  the treatment accorded to the Loyalists were so strong that the American  Commissioners were finally driven to the excuse that the Government of  the Confederation had no power over the individual States by whom  the necessary action must be taken. Finally, in a spirit of mutual  concession at the end of the negotiations, the Americans agreed that  Congress should \"recommend to the legislatures of the respective states  to provide for the restitution\" of properties which had been confiscated  \"belonging to real British subjects,\" and \"that persons of any other  description\" might return to the United States for a period of  twelve months and be \"unmolested in their endeavours to obtain the  restitution.\"    With this show of yielding on the part of the American Commissioners it  was possible to conclude the terms of peace, and the preliminary treaty  was drawn accordingly and agreed to on November 30, 1782. Franklin had  been of such great service during all the negotiations, smoothing  down ruffed feelings by his suavity and tact and presenting difficult  subjects in a way that made action possible, that to him was accorded  the unpleasant task of communicating what had been accomplished to  Vergennes, the French Minister, and of requesting at the same time \"a  fresh loan of twenty million francs.\" Franklin, of course, presented  his case with much \"delicacy and kindliness of manner\" and with a fair  degree of success. \"Vergennes thought that the signing of the articles  was premature, but he made no inconvenient remonstrances, ill procured  six millions of the twenty.\"* On September 3, 1783, the definite  treaty of peace was signed in due time it was ratified by the British  Parliament as well as by the American Congress. The new state, duly  accredited, thus took its place in the family of nations; but it was  a very humble place that was first assigned to the United States of  America.           * Channing, \"History of the United States,\" vol. III, p.       368.        CHAPTER II. TRADE AND INDUSTRY    Though the word revolution implies a violent break with the past, there  was nothing in the Revolution that transformed the essential character  or the characteristics of the American people. The Revolution severed  the ties which bound the colonies to Great Britain; it created some new  activities; some soldiers were diverted from their former trades and  occupation; but, as the proportion of the population engaged in the war  was relatively small and the area of country affected for any length  of time was comparatively slight, it is safe to say that in general the  mass of the people remained about the same after the war as before. The  professional man was found in his same calling; the artisan returned  to his tools, if he had ever laid them down; the shopkeeper resumed  his business, if it had been interrupted; the merchant went back to  his trading; and the farmer before the Revolution remained a farmer  afterward.    The country as a whole was in relatively good condition and the people  were reasonably prosperous; at least, there was no general distress or  poverty. Suffering had existed in the regions ravaged by war, but no  section had suffered unduly or had had to bear the burden of war during  the entire period of fighting. American products had been in demand,  especially in the West India Islands, and an illicit trade with the  enemy had sprung up, so that even during the war shippers were able to  dispose of their commodities at good prices. The Americans are commonly  said to have been an agricultural people, but it would be more correct  to say that the great majority of the people were dependent upon  extractive industries, which would include lumbering, fishing, and even  the fur trade, as well as the ordinary agricultural pursuits. Save for  a few industries, of which shipbuilding was one of the most important,  there was relatively little manufacturing apart from the household  crafts. These household industries had increased during the war, but as  it was with the individual so it was with the whole country; the general  course of industrial activity was much the same as it had been before  the war.    A fundamental fact is to be observed in the economy of the young nation:  the people were raising far more tobacco and grain and were extracting  far more of other products than they could possibly use themselves; for  the surplus they must "]]]
