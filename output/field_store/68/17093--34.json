Offensive manners on the part of the trainer quickly endanger the  existence of the choir. Not so in cathedrals, and the cathedral organist  knows this. 'I cannot think why that boy does not sing in tune; I have  boxed his ears;' said a cathedral organist once to me quite seriously.  This proves, I think, how blind even a highly-trained musician may be to  the need for any art in the mode of imparting instruction. I fear there  is a vulgar notion (only half defined, most probably) that irascibility  in the musical trainer is a mark of genius. I write from experience,  having been upwards of a quarter of a century in cathedrals, and a  considerable portion of that time precentor.\"    In conclusion, the custom of throwing a halo of sentiment round  choir-boys, and petting them, is much to be deprecated. It has become  the custom to write tales and songs about them, in which they are made  out to be little angels in disguise. All this is very foolish and  harmful. Choir-boys, as a rule, are no better and no worse than other  boys. They respond well to wise treatment, but need to be governed by  common sense, and to be taught their places. I am myself somewhat to  blame for illustrating this book with two pictures of choir boys. It is  really inconsistent.          CHAPTER IV.    VOICE TRAINING.                        { C2                    { B1      Small         { A1                    { G1                    {F1      Upper Thin.   {E1                   { {D1                   {C1      Lower Thin.  {B                   {A                   {G                   { {F      Upper Thick.  {E                    {D                    { C      Lower Thick.  { B_1                    { A_1                    { G_1    Before commencing to train a voice the choirmaster must make sure that  it is a voice worth training. He must take the boy alone, test his voice  by singing scales, and try especially his notes in the treble compass,  say, [Illustration: musical notation] He must test his ear by playing  phrases, and asking the boy to sing them. He must enquire into his  theoretical knowledge, if any, and ask if he has had a Tonic Sol-fa or  any other systematic training. The ear of the choirmaster must decide  upon the voice. It is said by some that boys' voices partake of one or  other of two qualities, the flute quality or the oboe quality. They  differ, no doubt, in _timbre_, but these two divisions are not clearly  marked. The diagram at the side gives the compass of the registers in  boy trebles and altos. The names are those invented by the late John  Curwen, and have the advantage of describing the physiological action  that goes on. Thus in the Thick Register, the vocal cords vibrate in  their whole thickness; in the Thin Register their thin edges alone  vibrate; and in the Small Register a small aperture only is made,  through which the sound comes. The registers are practically the same as  those of women's voices. They may be shown on the staff, thus:--    [Illustration: Lower Thick. Upper Thick. Lower Thin. Upper Thin. Small.    Chest. Middle. Falsetto.]    I give below the staff another set of names which are sometimes used,  but different voice-trainers attach to these different meanings.    It is undesirable to tell the boys anything about the registers. The  spirit of voice-training at the present time is too analytical. The  theory of the registers is for the teacher, not for the pupil. Some  voice-trainers seem to think that it is their business to discover the  registers, but as far as tone goes it is their business to conceal them.  Trainers work better through possessing physiological knowledge, but the  end is a smooth and homogeneous voice, blended and well-built.    Roughly speaking, the boys to be rejected are those who through  carelessness, excitement, or confirmed habit, force up the thick  register while singing. And those to be accepted are the boys who have  sufficient reserve and care to turn into the fluty tone at the proper  place, whether the music be loud or soft, and whatever be the shape of  the melodic passage. The right use of the voice is most likely to come  from boys who, whatever their social status, are well brought up, and  have been taught to avoid screaming, coarse laughing and bawling, and if  possible to speak in a clear way.    Voice studies are of two kinds. First come those which promote the  building and setting of the voice. These are generally sung slowly. When  the voice is becoming settled exercises for agility may be introduced.  Of agility exercises most voice-training books contain plenty. There is  a good selection in Mr. Sinclair Dunn's \"The Solo Singer's Vade Mecum\"  (J. Curwen & Sons, price 1s.) and Sir John Stainer has written a set,  printed on a card, which is published by Mowbray, Oxford and London,  price 6d.    When the system of probationers is at work the voice-building exercises  will not be much needed. The little boys will insensibly fall into right  habits. They will learn to produce tone as they learnt to speak--by ear.  But when a new choir has to be formed, the building exercises are  necessary. And the first object of these is to make the boy feel the  thin register and strengthen it by use. For this purpose such phrases as  these, which leap into the thin register, and quit it by step are the  best:--    [Illustration: KEY =E=[b]. d1 t l s d1 t l s m1 r1 d1 t d1]    [Illustration: KEY =G=. s f m r f m r d l s f s m]    These exercises should be sung to several vowels, but especially to the  sound \"koo,\" which will at first immensely amuse the boys, but will  afterwards be found to throw the tone forward towards the teeth in a way  that no other sound does.    Pure vowel tone goes with pure and resonant voice. The broad and pure  vowels of the Yorkshire dialect have, more than anything else, produced  the Yorkshire voices. Hence the choirmaster must make a determined  effort to cure provincialisms in so far as they prevent the issue of  pure vowel sounds from the mouth. The vowels should be sung in their  vocal order as recommended by Mr. Behnke, oo (as in _you_), o (as in  _owe_), ah (as in _Shah_), a (as _pay_), and ee (as in _see_). These may  be taken to slow scales, thus:--    [Illustration: oo-o-ah-a-ee oo-o-ah-a-ee, &c.]    Let the choirmaster watch carefully for impure sounds, and call upon  each boy to sing two measures by himself from time to time.    In singing the boy should stand upright and free. He must not lean or  bend his body. The mouth must be fairly opened, but not too wide. As the  voice ascends the mouth opens wider. The lips must lie lightly on the  teeth, and the tongue should lie at rest, just touching the front teeth.  If, for the sake of change during a long rehearsal, the boys sit, let it  be remembered that there are many ways of sitting, and that the upright  posture hinders the breath less than lolling and a crooked posture.  Rigidity is the enemy of all good singing. Let the whole body and vocal  apparatus be relaxed, and pure tone will result. \"If I hear a boy  forcing up his voice,\" said Herr Eglinger, of Basel, to me, \"I ask the  rest of the class to point him out, and they do it at once.\" This at  once cures the transgressor and sharpens the consciences of the other  boys. As to the vowel on which singers should be trained, there are  differences of opinion. Maurice Strakosch, the trainer of Patti,  Nilsson, &c., used \"ha,\" which causes a slight breath to precede the  articulation. This, he said, gives the voice a natural start. It is  something like the \"koo\" of Mrs. Seiler. Learners he required to lower  their heads while singing, and to show the upper teeth, so as to keep  the lips out of the way of the tone. Mr. Barnicott, a successful  choirmaster at Taunton, uses \"ka.\" But as in the actual singing of the  English language all the vowels are encountered in turn, it would seem  reasonable that they should all be included in the practice.    Mr. Walter Brooks, quoted elsewhere, lays stress upon long-sustained  notes in the scale of E flat, and up to G. These expand the lower part  of the lungs, and produce steady, firm tone. They should be sung both  loud and soft, the boys one by one and together. An admirable plan is to  keep boys on the alert listening for faults, asking those not singing,  \"Whose fault is that?\" Jealousy and conceit, says Mr. Brooks, are  avoided by giving a solo to three or four boys to sing in unison. Three  or four will blend better than two, and after proper rehearsal the tone  is so like one voice that people say, \"What a beautiful voice that boy  has!\"    As to balance of parts, the following table is given by Mr. H. B. Roney  of Chicago:--        Sopranos    12    17    25    37    50      Altos        4     5     7    11    14      Tenors       4     5     8    11    14      Basses       5     8    10    16    22                  --    --    --    --    --                  25    35    50    75   100    Mr. Stocks Hammond says that during voice exercise the boys should stand  perfectly erect, with mouth well open, the shoulders being thrown back.  After exercise in slowly inhaling and exhaling the breath, comes the  uniting of the registers. This is accomplished by singing up and down  the scales of C, D, and E to the syllable \"ah.\" Each tone is taken with  decision, and is followed by a slight pause. The same scales are  afterwards sung to \"oh\" and \"oo.\" This exercise should not last longer  that ten or fifteen minutes. Staccato scales to \"ah!\" \"oh!\" and  chromatic passages are introduced later.    Mr. G. Bernard Gilbert, F.C.O., of West Ham Parish Church, is an  exceptionally skilled trainer of boys' voices. He meets his boys  half-an-hour before each of the Sunday Services and \"tunes them up,\" an  admirable plan, which cannot be too widely imitated. The first thing he  does in training boys is to teach them to attack and leave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032"],[0,"Second Variety (#3)"],[1,"ng.\"    \"Waiting?\" Hendricks was puzzled. \"What were you waiting for?\"    \"To catch things.\"    \"What kind of things?\"    \"Things to eat.\"    \"Oh.\" Hendricks set his lips grimly. A thirteen year old boy, living  on rats and gophers and half-rotten canned food. Down in a hole under  the ruins of a town. With radiation pools and claws, and Russian  dive-mines up above, coasting around in the sky.    \"Where are we going?\" David asked.    \"To the Russian lines.\"    \"Russian?\"    \"The enemy. The people who started the war. They dropped the first  radiation bombs. They began all this.\"    The boy nodded. His face showed no expression.    \"I'm an American,\" Hendricks said.    There was no comment. On they went, the two of them, Hendricks walking  a little ahead, David trailing behind him, hugging his dirty teddy  bear against his chest.           *       *       *       *       *    About four in the afternoon they stopped to eat. Hendricks built a  fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete. He cleared the weeds  away and heaped up bits of wood. The Russians' lines were not very far  ahead. Around him was what had once been a long valley, acres of fruit  trees and grapes. Nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the  mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end. And the  clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind, settling  over the weeds and remains of buildings, walls here and there, once in  awhile what had been a road.    Hendricks made coffee and heated up some boiled mutton and bread.  \"Here.\" He handed bread and mutton to David. David squatted by the  edge of the fire, his knees knobby and white. He examined the food and  then passed it back, shaking his head.    \"No.\"    \"No? Don't you want any?\"    \"No.\"    Hendricks shrugged. Maybe the boy was a mutant, used to special food.  It didn't matter. When he was hungry he would find something to eat.  The boy was strange. But there were many strange changes coming over  the world. Life was not the same, anymore. It would never be the same  again. The human race was going to have to realize that.    \"Suit yourself,\" Hendricks said. He ate the bread and mutton by  himself, washing it down with coffee. He ate slowly, finding the food  hard to digest. When he was done he got to his feet and stamped the  fire out.    David rose slowly, watching him with his young-old eyes.    \"We're going,\" Hendricks said.    \"All right.\"    Hendricks walked along, his gun in his arms. They were close; he was  tense, ready for anything. The Russians should be expecting a runner,  an answer to their own runner, but they were tricky. There was always  the possibility of a slipup. He scanned the landscape around him.  Nothing but slag and ash, a few hills, charred trees. Concrete walls.  But someplace ahead was the first bunker of the Russian lines, the  forward command. Underground, buried deep, with only a periscope  showing, a few gun muzzles. Maybe an antenna.    \"Will we be there soon?\" David asked.    \"Yes. Getting tired?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why, then?\"    David did not answer. He plodded carefully along behind, picking his  way over the ash. His legs and shoes were gray with dust. His pinched  face was streaked, lines of gray ash in riverlets down the pale white  of his skin. There was no color to his face. Typical of the new  children, growing up in cellars and sewers and underground shelters.           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks slowed down. He lifted his fieldglasses and studied the  ground ahead of him. Were they there, someplace, waiting for him?  Watching him, the way his men had watched the Russian runner? A chill  went up his back. Maybe they were getting their guns ready, preparing  to fire, the way his men had prepared, made ready to kill.    Hendricks stopped, wiping perspiration from his face. \"Damn.\" It made  him uneasy. But he should be expected. The situation was different.    He strode over the ash, holding his gun tightly with both hands.  Behind him came David. Hendricks peered around, tight-lipped. Any  second it might happen. A burst of white light, a blast, carefully  aimed from inside a deep concrete bunker.    He raised his arm and waved it around in a circle.    Nothing moved. To the right a long ridge ran, topped with dead tree  trunks. A few wild vines had grown up around the trees, remains of  arbors. And the eternal dark weeds. Hendricks studied the ridge. Was  anything up there? Perfect place for a lookout. He approached the  ridge warily, David coming silently behind. If it were his command  he'd have a sentry up there, watching for troops trying to infiltrate  into the command area. Of course, if it were his command there would  be the claws around the area for full protection.    He stopped, feet apart, hands on his hips.    \"Are we there?\" David said.    \"Almost.\"    \"Why have we stopped?\"    \"I don't want to take any chances.\" Hendricks advanced slowly. Now the  ridge lay directly beside him, along his right. Overlooking him. His  uneasy feeling increased. If an Ivan were up there he wouldn't have a  chance. He waved his arm again. They should be expecting someone in  the UN uniform, in response to the note capsule. Unless the whole  thing was a trap.    \"Keep up with me.\" He turned toward David. \"Don't drop behind.\"    \"With you?\"    \"Up beside me! We're close. We can't take any chances. Come on.\"    \"I'll be all right.\" David remained behind him, in the rear, a few  paces away, still clutching his teddy bear.    \"Have it your way.\" Hendricks raised his glasses again, suddenly  tense. For a moment--had something moved? He scanned the ridge  carefully. Everything was silent. Dead. No life up there, only tree  trunks and ash. Maybe a few rats. The big black rats that had survived  the claws. Mutants--built their own shelters out of saliva and ash.  Some kind of plaster. Adaptation. He started forward again.           *       *       *       *       *    A tall figure came out on the ridge above him, cloak flapping.  Gray-green. A Russian. Behind him a second soldier appeared, another  Russian. Both lifted their guns, aiming.    Hendricks froze. He opened his mouth. The soldiers were kneeling,  sighting down the side of the slope. A third figure had joined them on  the ridge top, a smaller figure in gray-green. A woman. She stood  behind the other two.    Hendricks found his voice. \"Stop!\" He waved up at them frantically.  \"I'm--\"    The two Russians fired. Behind Hendricks there was a faint _pop_.  Waves of heat lapped against him, throwing him to the ground. Ash tore  at his face, grinding into his eyes and nose. Choking, he pulled  himself to his knees. It was all a trap. He was finished. He had come  to be killed, like a steer. The soldiers and the woman were coming  down the side of the ridge toward him, sliding down through the soft  ash. Hendricks was numb. His head throbbed. Awkwardly, he got his  rifle up and took aim. It weighed a thousand tons; he could hardly  hold it. His nose and cheeks stung. The air was full of the blast  smell, a bitter acrid stench.    \"Don't fire,\" the first Russian said, in heavily accented English.    The three of them came up to him, surrounding him. \"Put down your  rifle, Yank,\" the other said.    Hendricks was dazed. Everything had happened so fast. He had been  caught. And they had blasted the boy. He turned his head. David was  gone. What remained of him was strewn across the ground.    The three Russians studied him curiously. Hendricks sat, wiping blood  from his nose, picking out bits of ash. He shook his head, trying to  clear it. \"Why did you do it?\" he murmured thickly. \"The boy.\"    \"Why?\" One of the soldiers helped him roughly to his feet. He turned  Hendricks around. \"Look.\"    Hendricks closed his eyes.    \"Look!\" The two Russians pulled him forward. \"See. Hurry up. There  isn't much time to spare, Yank!\"    Hendricks looked. And gasped.    \"See now? Now do you understand?\"           *       *       *       *       *    From the remains of David a metal wheel rolled. Relays, glinting  metal. Parts, wiring. One of the Russians kicked at the heap of  remains. Parts popped out, rolling away, wheels and springs and rods.  A plastic section fell in, half charred. Hendricks bent shakily down.  The front of the head had come off. He could make out the intricate  brain, wires and relays, tiny tubes and switches, thousands of minute  studs--    \"A robot,\" the soldier holding his arm said. \"We watched it tagging  you.\"    \"Tagging me?\"    \"That's their way. They tag along with you. Into the bunker. That's  how they get in.\"    Hendricks blinked, dazed. \"But--\"    \"Come on.\" They led him toward the ridge. \"We can't stay here. It  isn't safe. There must be hundreds of them all around here.\"    The three of them pulled him up the side of the ridge, sliding and  slipping on the ash. The woman reached the top and stood waiting for  them.    \"The forward command,\" Hendricks muttered. \"I came to negotiate with  the Soviet--\"    \"There is no more forward command. _They_ got in. We'll explain.\" They  reached the top of the ridge. \"We're all that's left. The three of us.  The rest were down in the bunker.\"    \"This way. Down this way.\" The woman unscrewed a lid, a gray manhole  cover set in the ground. \"Get in.\"    Hendricks lowered himself. The two soldiers and the woman came behind  him, following him down the ladder. The woman closed the lid after  them, bolting it tightly into place.    \"Good thing we saw you,\" one of the two soldiers grunted. \"It had  tagged you about as far as it was going to.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Give me one of your cigarettes,\" the woman said. \"I haven't had an  American cigarette for weeks.\"    Hendricks pushed the pack to her. She took a cigarette and passed the  pack to the two soldiers. In the corner of the small room the lamp  gleamed fitfully. The room was low-ceilinged, cramped. The four of  them sat"]]]
