HOLLAENDER.      Dem Vater stets bewahr' sie ihre Liebe,    _Ihm_ treu, wird sie auch treu dem Gatten sein.          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          For the father she may always cherish filial love.        If true to him, true she will be to him she weds.      DALAND.      Du giebst Juwelen, unschätzbare Perlen,    Das höchste Kleinod doch, ein treues Weib. . .          DALAND.          While jewels and pearls are costly things,        The costliest still is a loving wife.      HOLLAENDER.      Du giebst es mir?          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          And she shall be mine?      DALAND.      Ich gebe Dir mein Wort.    Mich rührt Dein Loos; freigebig, wie Du bist,    Zeigst Edelmuth und hohen Sinn Du mir: --    Den Eidam wünscht' ich so, und wär' Dein Gut    Auch nicht so reich, wählt' ich doch keinen Andern.          DALAND.          My word I pledge to thee,        Thy fate has won my heart; thou'rt lavish;        Thus must be he who weds my daughter,        And if less rich thou wert, no other would I choose.      HOLLAENDER.      Hab' Dank! Werd' ich die Tochter heut' noch sehn?          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Thanks! Will I see thy girl ere sinks the day to rest?      DALAND.      Der nächste günst'ge Wind führt uns nach Haus.    Du sollst sie sehn, und wenn sie Dir gefällt --          DALAND.          With change of wind we set our sails homeward;        Once on shore, and if my daughter suits thee, then--      HOLLAENDER.      So ist sie mein. . . Wird sie mein Engel sein?    Wenn aus der Qualen Schreckgewalten    Die Sehnsucht nach dem Heil mich treibt,    Ist mir's erlaubt, mich fest zu halten    An _einer_ Hoffnung, die mir bleibt.    Darf ich in jenem Wahn noch schmachten,    Dass sich ein Engel mir erweicht?    Der Qualen, die mein Haupt umnachten,    Ersehntes Ziel hätt' ich erreicht.    Ach! ohne Hoffnung wie ich bin,    Geb' ich mich doch der Hoffnung hin!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Then she will be mine--my angel she shall be.        When out of torment's iron hold,          I long to see salvation near,        I cling--for so have I been told--          To _one_ hope still remaining dear.        May still I hope--I cannot pray--          That pity feel might angel-wife?        Then will I praise this happy day,          When o'er, at last, this woeful strife.        Though hope has died, and left no trace,        I hope again for joy and grace.      DALAND.      Gepriesen seid, des Sturms Gewalten,    Die ihr an diesen Strand mich triebt.    Fürwahr! Blos brauch ich festzuhalten,    Was sich so schön von selbst mir giebt.    Die ihn an diese Küste brachten    Ihr Winde sollt gesegnet sein!    Ja, wonach alle Väter trachten,    Ein reicher Eidam, er ist mein.    Dem Mann mit Gut und hohem Sinn    Geb' froh ich Haus und Tochter hin!          DALAND.          When from the South it blew a gale        That drove me to this rocky shore,        I did at first my fate bewail;        But now I wail and grieve no more.        I praise the wind that drove me here,        For here I met a lucky fate,        For here I found a treasure dear:        A rich man with my child to mate!        He who with treasure sails the sea,        Shall welcome to my daughter be!      STEUERMANN.      Südwind! Südwind!    Ach! lieber Südwind, blas' noch mehr!          MATE.          Southwind!

Du siehst, das Glück ist günstig Dir:    Der Wind ist gut, die See in Ruh'.    Sogleich die Anker lichten wir    Und segeln schnell der Heimath zu.          DALAND.          We are lucky, indeed; for good is the wind,        And smooth as a sea of glass is the sea;        Let us weigh the anchors without delay,        And set sail for the sheltering port.      MATROSEN.      Hohohe! Hohohe! Halloho! Jo! etc.          SAILORS.          Heigho! ho! Heigho! ho! ho!      HOLLAENDER.

You sail ahead, if it so pleases you,        The wind is good, but fatigued are my men;        I'll give them rest, and then I follow.      DALAND.      Doch unser Wind?          DALAND.          But if the wind should change?      HOLLAENDER.      Er bläst noch lang' aus Süd',    Mein Schiff ist schnell, es holt Dich sicher ein.          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          'T will blow from the South, be assured.        My ship sails fast, and will reach you soon.      DALAND.      Du glaubst? Wohlan! Es möge denn so sein.

The gale, ah, well! it came from the South--        Lucky for thee and me!        My girl, if it hadn't Southwind been,        I wouldn't see thee again!        Ah! come and blow, my Southwind fair,        Else waits my love in vain.        Hohohe! Johohe! heigho! heigho!            ZWEITER ACT.          ACT II.        ERSTE SCENE.          SCENE I.      MAEDCHEN.      Summ und brumm, du gutes Rädchen,    Munter, munter dreh' dich um!    Spinne, spinne tausend Fädchen,    Gutes Rädchen, summ' und brumm!    Mein Schatz ist auf dem Meere draus,    Er denkt nach Haus    An's fromme Kind:    Mein gutes Rädchen saus' und braus'!    Ach, gäbst du Wind,    Er käm' geschwind!    Spinnt, spinnt!    Fleissig, Mädchen!    Summ, brumm,    Gutes Rädchen!          GIRLS.          Hum and buzz! What cheerful sound!        Turn round the wheel, quick, quick, quick!        Spin the golden thread around!        Hum and buzz like magic trick!        My love sails o'er stormy sea,        And thinks of me,        His own sweetheart.        Pray, O pray, for him and me,        That storm depart,        Fair wind his part!        Spin and spin        The wheel around,        Hum and buzz        With cheery sound!      MARY.      Ei! Fleissig, fleissig, wie sie spinnen!    Will jede sich den Schatz gewinnen.          MARY.          See, how quick they turn the wheel!        Must be for love they for him feel.      MAEDCHEN.      Frau Mary, still! denn wohl Ihr wisst,    Das Lied noch nicht zu Ende ist.          GIRLS.          Thou mustn't speak! While floats our song        On airy wings, please hold thy tongue!      MARY.      So singt! dem Rädchen lässt's nicht Ruh'.    Du aber, Senta, schweigst dazu?          MARY.          Then sing your song the life-long night!        But, Senta! child, thou art so quiet.      MAEDCHEN.      Summ und brumm, du gutes Rädchen,    Munter, munter dreh' dich um!    Spinne, spinne tausend Fädchen,    Gutes Rädchen, summ und brumm!    Mein Schatz da draussen auf dem Meer    Im Süden er    Viel Gold gewinnt.    Ach, gutes Rädchen, braus' noch mehr!    Er giet's dem Kind,    Wenn's fleissig spinnt.    Spinnt, spinnt!    Fleissig, Mädchen!    Summ, brumm,    Gutes Rädchen!          GIRLS.          Hum and buzz! What cheerful sound        Turn round the wheel, quick, quick, quick!        Spin the golden thread around!        Hum and buzz like magic trick!        My love sails o'er stormy sea,        On Southland's coast        He seeks for gold.        Pray, O pray, that I may boast,        And share his gold.        And now behold          How turns the wheel        With cheery sound,          While sure I feel        For home he's bound!      MARY.      Du böses Kind, wenn Du nicht spinnst,    Vom Schatz Du kein Geschenk gewinnst!          MARY.          Thou bad child, thou, if thou wilt not spin,        Thou ne'er the gold thy love brings shalt win.      MAEDCHEN.      Sie hat's nicht noth, dass sie sich eilt,    Ihr Schatz nicht auf dem Meere weilt;    Bringt er nicht Gold, bringt er doch Wild,    Man weiss ja, was ein Jäger gilt!          GIRLS.          Why should she spin and work as we?        _Her_ love not sails o'er stormy sea,        Her love's a huntsman gay and bold,        He brings her game instead of gold.      MARY.      Da seht Ihr's! Immer vor dem Bild! --    Wirst Du Dein ganzes junges Leben    Verträumen vor dem Conterfei?          MARY.          Look at her! Always before the picture!        Senta, art thou to dream away thy young life,        Contemplating this portrait?      SENTA.      Was hast Du Kunde mir gegeben,    Was mir erzählet, wer es sei!    Der arme Mann!          SENTA.          Thine the blame!        From thee his history I learned--        Poor man he!      MARY.      Gott sei mit Dir!          MARY.          May God protect thy young life!      MAEDCHEN.      Ei, ei! Ei, ei! Was hören wir?    Sie seufzet um den bleichen Mann.          GIRLS.          What! what's this! listen well!        She sighs for him, this pale man.      MARY.      Den Kopf verliert sie noch darum.          MARY.          Her head will be turned, God knows!      MAEDCHEN.      Da sieht man, was ein Bild doch kann!          GIRLS.

Nichts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#3)"],[1," complex a principle of explanation, and that  by the law of habit formation. In common with other animals, birds are  subject to this law in a marked degree. An acquired mode of activity  becomes by repetition ingrained in the life of the individual, so that  an action performed to-day is liable to be repeated to-morrow so long as  it does not prejudice the existence or annul the fertility of the  individual.    Let us see how this may have operated in determining the limits of the  area acquired, and for this purpose let us suppose that we are observing  a male Reed-Bunting recently established in some secluded piece of marsh  land. Scattered about this particular marsh are a number of small  willows and young alder trees, each one of which is capable of providing  plenty of branches suitable for the bird to perch upon, and all are in a  like favourable position so far as the outlook therefrom is concerned.  Well, we should expect to find that each respective tree would be made  use of according to the position in which the bird happened to find  itself. But what actually do we find--one tree singled out and resorted  to with ever-increasing certainty until it becomes an important point in  relation to the occupied area, a headquarters from which the bird  advertises its presence by song, keeps watch upon the movements of its  neighbours, and sets out for the purpose of securing food. We then take  note of its wanderings in the immediate vicinity of the headquarters,  especially as regards the direction, frequency, and extent of the  journeys; and we discover not only that these journeys proceed from and  terminate in the special tree, but that there is a sameness about the  actual path that is followed. The bird takes a short flight, searches a  bush here and some rushes there, returns, and after a while repeats the  performance; we on our part mark the extreme limits reached in each  direction, and by continued observation discover that these limits are  seldom exceeded, that definition grows more and more pronounced, and  that by degrees the movements of the bird are confined within a  restricted area. In outline, this is what happens in a host of cases. By  repetition certain performances become stereotyped, certain paths fixed,  and a routine is thus established which becomes increasingly definite as  the season advances.    But while it would be quite untrue to say that this routine is never  departed from, and equally profitless to attempt to find a point beyond  which the bird will under no circumstances wander, yet there is enough  definition and more than enough to answer the purpose for which the  territory has, I believe, been evolved, that is to say the biological  end of reproduction. Again, however, the process of adjustment is a  complex one. Habit plays its part in determining the boundaries in a  rough and ready manner, but the congenital basis, which is to be found  in the behaviour adapted to a particular environment, is an important  factor in the situation. For example, if instead of resting content with  just a bare position sufficient for the purpose of reproduction, the  Guillemot were to hustle its neighbours from adjoining ledges, the  Guillemot as a species would probably disappear; or if instead of  securing an area capable of supplying sufficient food both for itself  and its young, the Chiffchaff were to confine itself to a single tree,  and, after the manner of the Guillemot, trust to spasmodic excursions  into neutral ground for the purpose of obtaining food, the Chiffchaff  as a species would probably not endure. All such adjustments have,  however, been brought about by relationships which have gradually become  interwoven in the tissue of the race.    The intolerance that the male displays towards other individuals,  usually of the same sex, leads to a vast amount of strife. Nowhere in  the animal world are conflicts more frequent, more prolonged, and more  determined than in the sexual life of birds; and though they are  acknowledged to be an important factor in the life of the individual,  yet there is much difference of opinion as to the exact position they  occupy in the drama of bird life. Partly because they frequently happen  to be in evidence, partly because they are numerically inferior, and  partly, I suppose, because the competition thus created would be a means  of maintaining efficiency, the females, by common consent, are supposed  to supply the condition under which the pugnacious nature of the male is  rendered susceptible to appropriate stimulation. And so long as the  evidence seemed to show that battles were confined to the male sex, so  long were there grounds for hoping that their origin might be traced to  such competition. But female fights with female, pair with pair, and,  which is still more remarkable, a pair will attack a single male or a  single female; moreover, males that reach their destination in advance  of their prospective mates engage in serious warfare. How then is it  possible to look upon the individuals of one sex as directly  responsible for the strife amongst those of the other, or how can the  female supply the necessary condition? As long as an attempt is made to  explain it in terms of the female, the fighting will appear to be of a  confused order; regard it, however, as part of a larger process which  demands, amongst other essential conditions of the breeding situation,  the occupation of a definite territory, and order will reign in place of  confusion.    But even supposing that the male inherits a disposition to acquire a  suitable area, even supposing that it inherits a disposition which  results indirectly in the defence of that area, how does it obtain a  mate? If the female behaved in a like manner, if she, too, were to  isolate herself and remain in one place definitely, that would only add  to the difficulties of mutual discovery. We find, however, in the  migrants, that the males are earlier than the females in reaching the  breeding grounds, and, in resident species, that they desert the females  and retire alone to their prospective territories, so that there is a  difference in the behaviour of the sexes at the very commencement of the  sexual process. What is the immediate consequence? Since the male  isolates itself, it follows, if the union of the sexes is to be  effected, that the discovery of a mate must rest largely with the  female. This of course reverses the accepted course of procedure. But  after all, what reason is there to suppose that, the male seeks the  female, or that a mutual search takes place; what reason to think that  this part of the process is subject to no control except such as may be  supplied by the laws of chance?    Now, clearly, much will depend upon the rapidity with which the female  can discover a male fit to breed; for if the course of reproduction is  to flow smoothly, there must be neither undue delay nor waste of energy  incurred in the search--some guidance is therefore necessary, some  control in her external environment. Here the song, or the mechanically  produced sound, comes into play, and assists in the attainment of this  end. Nevertheless if every male were to make use of its powers whether  it were in occupation of a territory or not, if the wandering individual  had an equal chance of attracting a mate, then it would be idle to  attempt to establish any relation between \"song\" on the one hand, and  \"territory\" on the other, and impossible to regard the voice as the  medium through which an effectual union of the sexes is procured. But  there is reason to believe that the males utilise their powers of  producing sound only under certain well-defined conditions. For  instance, when they are on their way to the breeding grounds, or moving  from locality to locality in search of isolation, or when they desert  their territories temporarily, as certain of the residents often do,  they are generally silent; but when they are in occupation of their  territories they become vociferous--and this is notoriously the case  during the early hours of the day, which is the period of maximum  activity so far as sexual behaviour is concerned. So that just at the  moment when the sexual impulse of the female is most susceptible to  stimulation, the males are betraying their positions and are thus a  guide to her movements. Nevertheless, even though she may have  discovered a male ready to breed, success is not necessarily assured to  her; for with multitudes of individuals striving to procreate their  kind, it would be surprising if there were no clashing of interests, if  no two females were ever to meet in the same occupied territory.  Competition of this kind is not uncommon, and the final appeal is to the  law of battle, just as an appeal to physical strength sometimes decides  the question of the initial ownership of a territory.    I shall try to make clear the relations of the various parts to the  whole with the assistance of whatever facts I can command. I shall do so  not only for the purposes of the theory, but because one so often finds  the more important features of sexual behaviour regarded as so many  distinct phenomena requiring separate treatment, whereas they are  mutually dependent, and follow one another in ordered sequence. I spoke  of the process as a series of relationships. Some of these relationships  have already been touched upon; others will become apparent if we  consider for a moment the purposes for which the territory has been  evolved. Indirectly its purpose is that of the whole process, the  rearing of offspring. But inasmuch as a certain measure of success could  be attained, and that perhaps often, without all the complications  introduced by the territory, there are manifestly advantages to be  gained by its inclusion in the scheme. The difficulties which beset the  path of reproduction are by no means always the same--all manner of"]]]
