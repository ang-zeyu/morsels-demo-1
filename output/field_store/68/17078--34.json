Growing very pale, she ran out into the hall. Her father was  already half way upstairs, his face red with fury. In the hall below  Ursula saw her step-mother, looking troubled and vexed. At the door  stood Malcolm Ramsay, a homely neighbour youth who had been courting  Ursula in his clumsy way ever since she grew up. Ursula had always hated  him.    \"'Ursula!' shouted old Hugh, 'come here and tell this scoundrel he lies.  He says that you met Kenneth MacNair in the beechgrove last Tuesday.  Tell him he lies! Tell him he lies!'    \"Ursula was no coward. She looked scornfully at poor Ramsay.    \"'The creature is a spy and a tale-bearer,' she said, 'but in this he  does not lie. I DID meet Kenneth MacNair last Tuesday.'    \"'And you dare to tell me this to my face!' roared old Hugh. 'Back to  your room, girl! Back to your room and stay there! Take off that finery.  You go to no more dances. You shall stay in that room until I choose to  let you out. No, not a word! I'll put you there if you don't go. In with  you--ay, and take your knitting with you. Occupy yourself with that this  evening instead of kicking your heels at The Springs!'    \"He snatched a roll of gray stocking from the hall table and flung  it into Ursula's room. Ursula knew she would have to follow it, or be  picked up and carried in like a naughty child. So she gave the miserable  Ramsay a look that made him cringe, and swept into her room with her  head in the air. The next moment she heard the door locked behind  her. Her first proceeding was to have a cry of anger and shame and  disappointment. That did no good, and then she took to marching up and  down her room. It did not calm her to hear the rumble of the carriage  out of the gate as her uncle and aunt departed.    \"'Oh, what's to be done?' she sobbed. 'Kenneth will be furious. He will  think I have failed him and he will go away hot with anger against me.  If I could only send a word of explanation I know he would not leave me.  But there seems to be no way at all--though I have heard that there's  always a way when there's a will. Oh, I shall go mad! If the window  were not so high I would jump out of it. But to break my legs or my neck  would not mend the matter.'    \"The afternoon passed on. At sunset Ursula heard hoof-beats and ran to  the window. Andrew Kinnear of The Springs was tying his horse at the  door. He was a dashing young fellow, and a political crony of old Hugh.  No doubt he would be at the dance that night. Oh, if she could get  speech for but a moment with him!    \"When he had gone into the house, Ursula, turning impatiently from the  window, tripped and almost fell over the big ball of homespun yarn  her father had flung on the floor. For a moment she gazed at it  resentfully--then, with a gay little laugh, she pounced on it. The next  moment she was at her table, writing a brief note to Kenneth MacNair.  When it was written, Ursula unwound the gray ball to a considerable  depth, pinned the note on it, and rewound the yarn over it. A gray  ball, the color of the twilight, might escape observation, where a white  missive fluttering down from an upper window would surely be seen by  someone. Then she softly opened her window and waited.    \"It was dusk when Andrew went away. Fortunately old Hugh did not come to  the door with him. As Andrew untied his horse Ursula threw the ball with  such good aim that it struck him, as she had meant it to do, squarely on  the head. Andrew looked up at her window. She leaned out, put her finger  warningly on her lips, pointed to the ball, and nodded. Andrew, looking  somewhat puzzled, picked up the ball, sprang to his saddle, and galloped  off.    \"So far, well, thought Ursula. But would Andrew understand? Would he  have wit enough to think of exploring the big, knobby ball for its  delicate secret? And would he be at the dance after all?    \"The evening dragged by. Time had never seemed so long to Ursula. She  could not rest or sleep. It was midnight before she heard the patter of  a handful of gravel on her window-panes. In a trice she was leaning out.  Below in the darkness stood Kenneth MacNair.    \"'Oh, Kenneth, did you get my letter? And is it safe for you to be  here?'    \"'Safe enough. Your father is in bed. I've waited two hours down the  road for his light to go out, and an extra half-hour to put him to  sleep. The horses are there. Slip down and out, Ursula. We'll make  Charlottetown by dawn yet.'    \"'That's easier said than done, lad. I'm locked in. But do you go out  behind the new barn and bring the ladder you will find there.'    \"Five minutes later, Miss Ursula, hooded and cloaked, scrambled  soundlessly down the ladder, and in five more minutes she and Kenneth  were riding along the road.    \"'There's a stiff gallop before us, Ursula,' said Kenneth.    \"'I would ride to the world's end with you, Kenneth MacNair,' said  Ursula. Oh, of course she shouldn't have said anything of the sort,  Felicity. But you see people had no etiquette departments in those days.  And when the red sunlight of a fair October dawn was shining over the  gray sea The Fair Lady sailed out of Charlottetown harbour. On her deck  stood Kenneth and Ursula MacNair, and in her hand, as a most precious  treasure, the bride carried a ball of gray homespun yarn.\"    \"Well,\" said Dan, yawning, \"I like that kind of a story. Nobody goes and  dies in it, that's one good thing.\"    \"Did old Hugh forgive Ursula?\" I asked.    \"The story stopped there in the brown book,\" said the Story Girl, \"but  the Awkward Man says he did, after awhile.\"    \"It must be rather romantic to be run away with,\" remarked Cecily,  wistfully.    \"Don't you get such silly notions in your head, Cecily King,\" said  Felicity, severely.          CHAPTER III. THE CHRISTMAS HARP      Great was the excitement in the houses of King as Christmas drew nigh.  The air was simply charged with secrets. Everybody was very penurious  for weeks beforehand and hoards were counted scrutinizingly every day.  Mysterious pieces of handiwork were smuggled in and out of sight, and  whispered consultations were held, about which nobody thought of being  jealous, as might have happened at any other time. Felicity was in her  element, for she and her mother were deep in preparations for the  day. Cecily and the Story Girl were excluded from these doings  with indifference on Aunt Janet's part and what seemed ostentatious  complacency on Felicity's. Cecily took this to heart and complained to  me about it.    \"I'm one of this family just as much as Felicity is,\" she said, with as  much indignation as Cecily could feel, \"and I don't think she need  shut me out of everything. When I wanted to stone the raisins for the  mince-meat she said, no, she would do it herself, because Christmas  mince-meat was very particular--as if I couldn't stone raisins right!  The airs Felicity puts on about her cooking just make me sick,\"  concluded Cecily wrathfully.    \"It's a pity she doesn't make a mistake in cooking once in a while  herself,\" I said. \"Then maybe she wouldn't think she knew so much more  than other people.\"    All parcels that came in the mail from distant friends were taken charge  of by Aunts Janet and Olivia, not to be opened until the great day of  the feast itself. How slowly the last week passed! But even watched pots  will boil in the fulness of time, and finally Christmas day came, gray  and dour and frost-bitten without, but full of revelry and rose-red  mirth within. Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl came over  early for the day; and Peter came too, with his shining, morning face,  to be hailed with joy, for we had been afraid that Peter would not be  able to spend Christmas with us. His mother had wanted him home with  her.    \"Of course I ought to go,\" Peter had told me mournfully, \"but we won't  have turkey for dinner, because ma can't afford it. And ma always cries  on holidays because she says they make her think of father. Of course  she can't help it, but it ain't cheerful. Aunt Jane wouldn't have cried.  Aunt Jane used to say she never saw the man who was worth spoiling her  eyes for. But I guess I'll have to spend Christmas at home.\"    At the last moment, however, a cousin of Mrs. Craig's in Charlottetown  invited her for Christmas, and Peter, being given his choice of going or  staying, joyfully elected to stay. So we were all together, except Sara  Ray, who had been invited but whose mother wouldn't let her come.    \"Sara Ray's mother is a nuisance,\" snapped the Story Girl. \"She just  lives to make that poor child miserable, and she won't let her go to the  party tonight, either.\"    \"It is just breaking Sara's heart that she can't,\" said Cecily  compassionately. \"I'm almost afraid I won't enjoy myself for thinking of  her, home there alone, most likely reading the Bible, while we're at the  party.\"    \"She might be worse occupied than reading the Bible,\" said Felicity  rebukingly.    \"But Mrs. Ray makes her read it as a punishment,\" protested Cecily.  \"Whenever Sara cries to go anywhere--and of course she'll cry  tonight--Mrs. Ray makes her read seven chapters in the Bible. I wouldn't  think that would make her very fond of it. And I'll not be able to talk  the party over with Sara afterwards--and that's half the fun gone.\"    \"You can tell her all about it,\" comforted Felix.    \"Telling isn't a bit like talking it over,\" retorted Cecily. \"It's too  one-sided.\"    We had an exciting time opening our presents. Some of us had more than  others, but we all received enough to make us feel comfortably that we  were not unduly neglected in the matter. The contents of the box which  the Story Girl's father had sent her from Paris made our eyes stick out.  It was full of beautiful things, among them another red silk dress--not  the bright, flame-hued tint of her old one, but a rich, dark crimson,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#3)"],[1,"ersonalities?\"    \"Exactly. However, you aren't neurotic, and ordinarily there would not  be the slightest chance of your repressed alternate taking over your  personality.\"    \"Thank you,\" Jay murmured ironically, \"I'd be losing sleep over that.\"    \"Nevertheless I presume you _do_ have such a subsidiary personality,  although he would normally never manifest. This subsidiary--let's call  him Jay_{2}--would embody all the characteristics which you repress. He  would be gregarious, where you are retiring and studious; adventurous  where you are cautious; talkative while you are taciturn; he would  perhaps enjoy action for its own sake, while you exercise faithfully in  the gymnasium only for your health's sake; and he might even remember  the trailmen with pleasure rather than dislike.\"    \"In short--a blend of all the undesirable characteristics?\"    \"One could put it that way. Certainly he would be a blend of all the  characteristics which you, Jay_{1}, _consider_ undesirable. But--if  released by hypnotism and suggestion, he might be suitable for the job  in hand.\"    \"But how do you know I actually have such an--alternate?\"    \"I don't. But it's a good guess. Most repressed--\" Forth coughed and  amended, \"most _disciplined_ personalities possess such a suppressed  secondary personality. Don't you occasionally--rather rarely--find  yourself doing things which are entirely out of character for you?\"    I could almost feel Allison taking it in, as he confessed, \"Well--yes.  For instance--the other day--although I dress conservatively at all  times--\" he glanced at his uniform coat, \"I found myself buying--\" he  stopped again and his face went an unlovely terra-cotta color as he  finally mumbled, \"a flowered red sports shirt.\"    Sitting in the dark I felt vaguely sorry for the poor gawk, disturbed  by, ashamed of the only human impulses he ever had. On the screen  Allison frowned fiercely, \"A crazy impulse.\"    \"You could say that, or say it was an action of the suppressed Jay_{2}.  How about it, Allison? You may be the only Terran on Darkover, maybe the  only human, who could get into a trailman's Nest without being  murdered.\"    \"Sir--as a citizen of the Empire, I don't have any choice, do I?\"    \"Jay, look,\" Forth said, and I felt him trying to reach through the  barricade and touch, really touch that cold contained young man, \"we  couldn't _order_ any man to do anything like this. Aside from the  ordinary dangers, it could destroy your personal balance, maybe  permanently. I'm asking you to volunteer something above and beyond the  call of duty. Man to man--what do you say?\"    I would have been moved by his words. Even at secondhand I was moved by  them. Jay Allison looked at the floor, and I saw him twist his long  well-kept surgeon's hands and crack the knuckles with an odd gesture.  Finally he said, \"I haven't any choice either way, Doctor. I'll take the  chance. I'll go to the trailmen.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The screen went dark again and Forth flicked the light on. He said,  \"Well?\"    I gave it back, in his own intonation, \"Well?\" and was exasperated to  find that I was twisting my own knuckles in the nervous gesture of  Allison's painful decision. I jerked them apart and got up.    \"I suppose it didn't work, with that cold fish, and you decided to come  to me instead? Sure, _I'll_ go to the trailmen for you. Not with that  Allison--I wouldn't go anywhere with that guy--but I speak the  trailmen's language, and without hypnosis either.\"    Forth was staring at me. \"So you've remembered that?\"    \"Hell, yes,\" I said, \"my dad crashed in the Hellers, and a band of  trailmen found me, half dead. I lived there until I was about fifteen,  then their Old-One decided I was too human for them, and they took me  out through Dammerung Pass and arranged to have me brought here. Sure,  it's all coming back now. I spent five years in the Spacemen's  Orphanage, then I went to work taking Terran tourists on hunting parties  and so on, because I liked being around the mountains. I--\" I stopped.  Forth was staring at me.    \"You think you'd like this job?\"    \"It would be tough,\" I said, considering. \"The People of the Sky--\"  (using the trailmen's name for themselves) \"--don't like outsiders, but  they might be persuaded. The worst part would be getting there. The  plane, or the 'copter, isn't built that can get through the crosswinds  around the Hellers and land inside them. We'd have to go on foot, all  the way from Carthon. I'd need professional climbers--mountaineers.\"    \"Then you don't share Allison's attitude?\"    \"Dammit, don't insult me!\" I discovered that I was on my feet again,  pacing the office restlessly. Forth stared and mused aloud, \"What's  personality anyway? A mask of emotions, superimposed on the body and the  intellect. Change the point of view, change the emotions and desires,  and even with the same body and the same past experiences, you have a  new man.\"    I swung round in mid-step. A new and terrible suspicion, too monstrous  to name, was creeping up on me. Forth touched a button and the face of  Jay Allison, immobile, appeared on the visionscreen. Forth put a mirror  in my hand. He said, \"Jason Allison, look at yourself.\"    I looked.    \"No,\" I said. And again, \"No. No. No.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Forth didn't argue. He pointed, with a stubby finger. \"Look--\" he moved  the finger as he spoke, \"height of forehead. Set of cheekbones. Your  eyebrows look different, and your mouth, because the expression is  different. But bony structure--the nose, the chin--\"    I heard myself make a queer sound; dashed the mirror to the floor. He  grabbed my forearm. \"Steady, man!\"    I found a scrap of my voice. It didn't sound like Allison's. \"Then  I'm--Jay_{2}? Jay Allison with amnesia?\"    \"Not exactly.\" Forth mopped his forehead with an immaculate sleeve and  it came away damp with sweat, \"No--_not_ Jay Allison as I know him!\" He  drew a long breath. \"And sit down. Whoever you are, sit _down_!\"    I sat. Gingerly. Not sure.    \"But the man Jay might have been, given a different temperamental bias.  I'd say--the man Jay Allison started out to be. The man he _refused_ to  be. Within his subconscious, he built up barriers against a whole series  of memories, and the subliminal threshold--\"    \"Doc, I don't understand the psycho talk.\"    Forth stared. \"And you do remember the trailmen's language. I thought  so. Allison's personality is suppressed in you, as yours was in him.\"    \"One thing, Doc. I don't know a thing about blood fractions or  epidemics. My half of the personality didn't study medicine.\" I took up  the mirror again and broodingly studied the face there. The high thin  cheeks, high forehead shaded by coarse dark hair which Jay Allison had  slicked down now heavily rumpled. I still didn't think I looked anything  like the doctor. Our voices were nothing alike either; his had been  pitched rather high, falsetto. My own, as nearly as I could judge, was a  full octave deeper, and more resonant. Yet they issued from the same  vocal chords, unless Forth was having a reasonless, macabre joke.    \"Did I honest-to-God study medicine? It's the last thing I'd think  about. It's an honest trade, I guess, but I've never been that  intellectual.\"    \"You--or rather, Jay Allison is a specialist in Darkovan parasitology,  as well as a very competent surgeon.\" Forth was sitting with his chin in  his hands, watching me intently. He scowled and said, \"If anything, the  physical change is more startling than the other. I wouldn't have  recognized you.\"    \"That tallies with me. I don't recognize myself.\" I added, \"--and the  queer thing is, I didn't even _like_ Jay Allison, to put it mildly. If  he--I can't say _he_, can I?\"    \"I don't know why not. You're no more Jay Allison than I am. For one  thing, you're younger. Ten years younger. I doubt if any of his  friends--if he had any--would recognize you. You--it's ridiculous to go  on calling you Jay_{2}. What should I call you?\"    \"Why should I care? Call me Jason.\"    \"Suits you,\" Forth said enigmatically. \"Look, then, Jason. I'd like to  give you a few days to readjust to your new personality, but we are  really pressed for time. Can you fly to Carthon tonight? I've  hand-picked a good crew for you, and sent them on ahead. You'll meet  them there. You'll find them competent.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I stared at him. Suddenly the room oppressed me and I found it hard to  breathe. I said in wonder, \"You were pretty sure of yourself, weren't  you?\"    Forth just looked at me, for what seemed a long time. Then he said, in a  very quiet voice, \"No. I wasn't sure at all. But if you didn't turn up,  and I couldn't talk Jay into it, I'd have had to try it myself.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jason Allison, Junior, was listed on the directory of the Terran HQ as  \"Suite 1214, Medical Residence Corridor.\" I found the rooms without any  trouble, though an elderly doctor stared at me rather curiously as I  barged along the quiet hallway. The suite--bedroom, minuscule  sitting-room, compact bath--depressed me; clean, closed-in and neutral  as the man who owned them, I rummaged them restlessly, trying to find  some scrap of familiarity to indicate that I had lived here for the past  eleven years.    Jay Allison was thirty-four years old. I had given my age, without  hesitation, as 22. There were no obvious blanks in my memory; from the  moment Jay Allison had spoken of the trailmen, my past had rushed back  and stood, complete to yesterday's supper (only had I eaten that supper  twelve years ago)? I remembered my father, a lined silent man who had  liked to fly solitary, taking photograph after photograph from his plane  for the meticulous work of Mapping and Exploration. He'd liked to have  me fly with him and I'd flown over virtually every inch of the planet.  No one else"]]]
