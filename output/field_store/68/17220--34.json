Prosper was silent with astonishment.    \"Answer,\" pursued M. Fauvel: \"have I not always been like a father to  you? From the first day, my house has been open to you; you were treated  as a member of my family; Madeleine and my sons looked upon you as a  brother. But you grew weary of this peaceful life. One day, a year ago,  you suddenly began to shun us; and since then----\"    The memories of the past thus evoked by the banker seemed too much for  the unhappy cashier; he buried his face in his hands, and wept bitterly.    \"A man can confide everything to his father without fear of being  harshly judged,\" resumed M. Fauvel. \"A father not only pardons, he  forgets. Do I not know the terrible temptations that beset a young man  in a city like Paris? There are some inordinate desires before which the  firmest principles must give way, and which so pervert our moral sense  as to render us incapable of judging between right and wrong. Speak,  Prosper, Speak!\"    \"What do you wish me to say?\"    \"The truth. When an honorable man yields, in an hour of weakness, to  temptation, his first step toward atonement is confession. Say to me,  Yes, I have been tempted, dazzled: the sight of these piles of gold  turned my brain. I am young: I have passions.\"    \"I?\" murmured Prosper. \"I?\"    \"Poor boy,\" said the banker, sadly; \"do you think I am ignorant of the  life you have been leading since you left my roof a year ago? Can you  not understand that all your fellow-clerks are jealous of you? that they  do not forgive you for earning twelve thousand francs a year? Never have  you committed a piece of folly without my being immediately informed of  it by an anonymous letter. I could tell the exact number of nights  you have spent at the gaming-table, and the amount of money you have  squandered. Oh, envy has good eyes and a quick ear! I have great  contempt for these cowardly denunciations, but was forced not only to  heed them, but to make inquiries myself. It is only right that I should  know what sort of a life is led by the man to whom I intrust my fortune  and my honor.\"    Prosper seemed about to protest against this last speech.    \"Yes, my honor,\" insisted M. Fauvel, in a voice that a sense of  humiliation rendered still more vibrating: \"yes, my credit might have  been compromised to-day by this M. de Clameran. Do you know how much  I shall lose by paying him this money? And suppose I had not had the  securities which I have sacrificed? you did not know I possessed them.\"    The banker paused, as if hoping for a confession, which, however, did  not come.    \"Come, Prosper, have courage, be frank. I will go upstairs. You will  look again in the safe: I am sure that in your agitation you did not  search thoroughly. This evening I will return; and I am confident that,  during the day, you will have found, if not the three hundred and fifty  thousand francs, at least the greater portion of it; and to-morrow  neither you nor I will remember anything about this false alarm.\"    M. Fauvel had risen, and was about to leave the room, when Prosper  arose, and seized him by the arm.    \"Your generosity is useless, monsieur,\" he said, bitterly; \"having  taken nothing, I can restore nothing. I have searched carefully; the  bank-notes have been stolen.\"    \"But by whom, poor fool? By whom?\"    \"By all that is sacred, I swear that it was not by me.\"    The banker's face turned crimson. \"Miserable wretch!\" cried he, \"do you  mean to say that I took the money?\"    Prosper bowed his head, and did not answer.    \"Ah! it is thus, then,\" said M. Fauvel, unable to contain himself any  longer. \"And you dare--. Then, between you and me, M. Prosper Bertomy,  justice shall decide. God is my witness that I have done all I could to  save you. You will have yourself to thank for what follows. I have sent  for the commissary of police: he must be waiting in my study. Shall I  call him down?\"    Prosper, with the fearful resignation of a man who abandons himself,  replied, in a stifled voice:    \"Do as you will.\"    The banker was near the door, which he opened, and, after giving the  cashier a last searching look, said to an office-boy:    \"Anselme, ask the commissary of police to step down.\"          III    If there is one man in the world whom no event can move or surprise, who  is always on his guard against deceptive appearances, and is capable  of admitting everything and explaining everything, it certainly is a  Parisian commissary of police.    While the judge, from his lofty place, applies the code to the facts  submitted to him, the commissary of police observes and watches all  the odious circumstances that the law cannot reach. He is perforce the  confidant of disgraceful details, domestic crimes, and tolerated vices.    If, when he entered upon his office, he had any illusions, before the  end of a year they were all dissipated.    If he does not absolutely despise the human race, it is because often,  side by side with abominations indulged in with impunity, he discovers  sublime generosities which remain unrewarded.    He sees impudent scoundrels filching public respect; and he consoles  himself by thinking of the modest, obscure heroes whom he has also  encountered.    So often have his previsions been deceived, that he has reached a state  of complete scepticism. He believes in nothing, neither in evil nor in  absolute good; not more in virtue than in vice.    His experience has forced him to come to the sad conclusion that not  men, but events, are worth considering.    The commissary sent for by M. Fauvel soon made his appearance.    It was with a calm air, if not one of perfect indifference, that he  entered the office.    He was followed by a short man dressed in a full suit of black, which  was slightly relieved by a crumpled collar.    The banker, scarcely bowing to him, said:    \"Doubtless, monsieur, you have been apprised of the painful circumstance  which compels me to have recourse to your assistance?\"    \"It is about a robbery, I believe.\"    \"Yes; an infamous and mysterious robbery committed in this office,  from the safe you see open there, of which my cashier\" (he pointed to  Prosper) \"alone possesses the key and the word.\"    This declaration seemed to arouse the unfortunate cashier from his dull  stupor.    \"Excuse me, monsieur,\" he said to the commissary in a low tone. \"My  chief also has the word and the key.\"    \"Of course, that is understood.\"    The commissary at once drew his own conclusions.    Evidently these two men accused each other.    From their own statements, one or the other was guilty.    One was the head of an important bank: the other was a simple cashier.    One was the chief: the other was the clerk.    But the commissary of police was too well skilled in concealing his  impressions to betray his thoughts by any outward sign. Not a muscle of  his face moved.    But he became more grave, and alternately watched the cashier and M.  Fauvel, as if trying to draw some profitable conclusion from their  behavior.    Prosper was very pale and dejected. He had dropped into a seat, and his  arms hung inert on either side of the chair.    The banker, on the contrary, remained standing with flashing eyes and  crimson face, expressing himself with extraordinary violence.    \"And the importance of the theft is immense,\" continued M. Fauvel; \"they  have taken a fortune, three hundred and fifty thousand francs. This  robbery might have had the most disastrous consequences. In times  like these, the want of this sum might compromise the credit of the  wealthiest banking-house in Paris.\"    \"I believe so, if notes fall due.\"    \"Well, monsieur, I had this very day a heavy payment to make.\"    \"Ah, really!\"    There was no mistaking the commissary's tone; a suspicion, the first,  had evidently entered his mind.    The banker understood it; he started, and said, quickly:    \"I met the demand, but at the cost of a disagreeable sacrifice. I ought  to add further that, if my orders had been obeyed, the three hundred and  fifty thousand francs would not have been in.\"    \"How is that?\"    \"I never desire to have large sums of money in my house over-night. My  cashier had positive orders to wait always until the last moment before  drawing money from the Bank of France. I above all forbade him to leave  money in the safe over-night.\"    \"You hear this?\" said the commissary to Prosper.    \"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the cashier, \"M. Fauvel's statement is quite  correct.\"    After this explanation, the suspicions of the commissary, instead of  being strengthened, were dissipated.    \"Well,\" he said, \"a robbery has been perpetrated, but by whom? Did the  robber enter from without?\"    The banker hesitated a moment.    \"I think not,\" he said at last.    \"And I am certain he did not,\" said Prosper.    The commissary expected and was prepared for those answers; but it did  not suit his purpose to follow them up immediately.    \"However,\" said he, \"we must make ourselves sure of it.\" Turning toward  his companion:    \"M. Fanferlot,\" he said, \"go and see if you cannot discover some traces  that may have escaped the attention of these gentlemen.\"    M. Fanferlot, nicknamed the Squirrel, was indebted to his prodigious  agility for this title, of which he was not a little proud. Slim and  insignificant in appearance he might, in spite of his iron muscles, be  taken for a bailiff's under clerk, as he walked along buttoned up to the  chin in his thin black overcoat. He had one of those faces that impress  us disagreeably--an odiously turned-up nose, thin lips, and little,  restless black eyes.    Fanferlot, who had been on the police force for five years, burned to  distinguish himself, to make for himself a name. He was ambitious. Alas!  he was unsuccessful, lacking opportunity--or genius.

Back and wings, bluish brown;  primaries, or longest wing feathers, dark brown; breast, deep ashy  blue, shading into a dirty buff at the lower part of the abdomen;  flanks, dirty brown with white markings.    The northern coast species are darker with more of an olive tinge.  But all the markings are the same.    Female--The female resembles the male in general color, but without  the black head and throat. The plume is dirty brown, about half the  length of the male's and nearly straight.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest consists of a depression in the ground  carefully hid away in some bunch of grass or brush, and usually  contains from fifteen to twenty very light buff or white eggs, often  faintly speckled.    =Measurements=--Length, eight to nine inches; wing, 4-1/2; tail, 4;  bill, 1/2.        [Illustration: GAMBEL QUAIL OR ARIZONA QUAIL (Lophortyx gambeli)]      THE GAMBEL QUAIL    (Lophortyx gambeli)    The gambel partridge occupies a unique position in its common  nomenclature. In California it is known as the Arizona quail, while  the sportsmen of Arizona refer to it as the California quail. In this,  too, they both have good reasons for the names used, for these birds  are found on both sides of the Colorado river, that is in both Arizona  and California. Commencing in the Mexican state of Sonora, where they  are found from the western slope of the Sierra Madre mountains to the  Gulf of California, the range of the species extends northward and  eastward through western Arizona, and, crossing the Colorado river  onto the desert of the same name, passes through southeastern  California into southern and central Nevada and Utah. The gambel quail  belongs to the same genus as the two species of the California valley  quail and in general appearance resembles them.    The gambel quail is emphatically a desert bird, able to live through  the long, dry seasons without water. If there are any trees in its  neighborhood it will seek them for roosting purposes, but it is found  distributed over vast sections where even the smallest brush is very  scattering and under cover nearly quite if not entirely absent, yet in  such places this member of the resourceful blue quail family protects  itself from hawks and predatory animals with an astonishing success.  The gambel quail is a true runner and can develop an astonishing speed  for so small a bird. A very large part of the unwarranted reputation  of the California valley quail as a runner is derived from confounding  it with the gambel and the habit of the Arizona sportsmen of calling  the gambel the California quail, but even as great runners as the  gambel quail are, I have found them to lie well to the dog in the  heavy bunch-grass sections of southeastern California and southern  Nevada. I have also had fine sport with them along the bottoms of the  Colorado river, where they are to be found in abundance.    The food is practically the same as the California valley quail.    =Color=--The general color of the upper parts and the breast is  lighter and more of an ashy blue than the valley quail, but in its  markings the gambel is the more conspicuous and more brilliant. The  black throat, bordered with white, the gray forehead and the forward  turned plume are common to both, but the top of the head of the gambel  is a bright cinnamon red, while that of the valley quail is a sooty  brown. The flanks of the gambel are conspicuously marked with bright  chestnut brown with each feather with a narrow central stripe of  white.    =Nest and Eggs=--Are the same in this species as in the valley quail.    =Measurements=--Same as the valley quail.        [Illustration: SCALED QUAIL (Callipepla squamata)]      THE SCALED QUAIL    (Callipepla squamata)    Next in geographical order is the scaled quail of Arizona and northern  Mexico generally. This, too, is a desert bird which I have seen in  great numbers at least twenty-five miles from the nearest water. It is  the only member of the quail family where there is no difference in  the markings of the sexes, except the mountain quail. In the open  country it, too, is a runner, though it can not begin to develop the  speed of the gambel nor will it continue to run for such long  distances.    During a residence of a year in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, where  I was developing some mining property, I found the scaled quail in  great numbers all around me. Very few of the Mexican people are wing  shots and few hunt except for the resulting meat. Little attention,  therefore, is paid to the quail, and in the section where I was  located I do not believe that even the \"oldest inhabitant\" of the  quail settlement had ever heard the report of a shotgun. I had with me  a brace of English setters, and these birds, though found among chino  grama grass and low maguey plant, which offered splendid opportunities  for hiding, not only tried my patience to the limit, but that of my  dogs as well, by deliberately walking about twenty-five to thirty  paces in front of me without the least thought of either hiding or  taking to wing. By firing a couple of shots over them each morning I  soon educated them to flush at the sight of me. In a couple of weeks  they behaved very well and furnished me with good sport, hiding  readily and lying good for the dogs.    Most of the game birds need more or less educating before they fully  meet the requirements of the sportsmen. Most, too, of the complaints  that sportsmen make regarding the bad behavior of certain species of  game or birds of certain sections should be charged to the lack on the  part of the hunter of a knowledge of their habits rather than to the  ill manners of the birds. One will often hear it said that certain men  are lucky hunters and can not help staggering onto their game. Such  men are lucky because they make a close study of the ways of the birds  of each separate character of country. Knowing the places in which  they will most likely be found feeding, they approach them from such  directions as will have a tendency to drive them into the desired  cover. A great deal of the annoyance of running birds, I have found,  can be avoided by a careful study of their habits and proper  management in handling them, and this is especially true of the scaled  quail.    =Color=--The back, the wings and tail coverts are a  light, ashy blue, but the feathers of the shoulders, breast and  abdomen are margined with dark brown, with a yellowish arrow-shaped  central spot which gives them the appearance of scales. Its throat is  a very faint buff, and instead of the plume of the genus Lophortyx it  has a broad erectile crest with the feathers tipped with white. Both  sexes are alike.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nesting habits are the same as those of the other  species of the blue quail family, but the eggs are more of a buff and  generally more speckled with brown.    =Measurements=--About the same as the valley quail.      THE CHESTNUT-BELLIED SCALE QUAIL    (Callipepla squamata castaneigastra)    The chestnut-bellied scaled quail is a subspecies of the scaled quail  just described. They are not numerous and hardly enter the territory  covered by this work. Intergrades of the two species are occasionally  found in northern Mexico and possibly in southeastern Arizona. In  general appearance they resemble the former species, being, however, a  little darker and with a strong chestnut blotch on the belly.        [Illustration: ELEGANT QUAIL (Callipepla elegans)]      THE ELEGANT QUAIL    (Callipepla elegans)    Along the western slope of the Sierra Madre range in the state of  Sonora, Mexico, is to be found another member of the blue quail family  whose habits appeal strongly to the sportsman. This species, known as  the elegant quail, is one of the most handsomely marked of the group.  From the blending of the white throat of the bobwhite with the black  one of the gambel, and the brown of the back of the one with the blue  of the other, together with a marked resemblance in its call to that  of the bobwhite, suggests the possibility of its origin having  resulted from a cross of the two genera. I may add that both the  gambel and a species of the =Collinus=, bobwhite, are found in this  same section.    The elegant quail is generally found in and around the cultivated  fields which they seem to prefer to the open country. While the  elegant quail will walk leisurely in front of their pursuer until too  closely approached, they can in no sense be termed runners. When  flushed they take to cover and lie closely. Like all the quail of  Mexico they have been hunted but little and need to be well scared  before they become properly educated to the gun. After a few days'  hunting I found them a very satisfactory game bird. Being found around  the fields, the grounds and cover were all that could be desired for  excellent sport.    =Color=--Male--Plume straight, upright feathers about an inch and a  quarter to an inch and a half in length, varying in color--possibly on  account of age--from a light lemon to a dark reddish orange. The  throat is finely mottled with small black and white dots, giving it a  dark gray appearance. The general color of the back and the wing and  tail coverts is a dark blue with about half of the exposed portion of  each feather tipped with a bright, rich brown. The breast and abdomen  is a light, ashy blue, profusely flecked with large, circular white  spots.    Female--The plume is about two-thirds the length of that of the male,  brown in color and barred with black. The breast and abdomen are  spotted like the male but the back is much the color of the English  snipe.    =Nest and Eggs=--The same as the other species of the blue quail.    =Measurements=--Same as the valley quail.
