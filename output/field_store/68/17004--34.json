All his wants were thus satisfied; but the cow, looking about her for  food in her turn, began to lick the salt off a neighbouring ice-block  with her rough tongue. This she continued to do until first the hair of  a god appeared and then the whole head emerged from its icy envelope,  until by-and-by Buri (the producer) stepped forth entirely free.    While the cow had been thus engaged, Ymir, the giant, had fallen  asleep, and as he slept a son and daughter were born from the  perspiration under his armpit, and his feet produced the six-headed  giant Thrudgelmir, who, shortly after his birth, brought forth in  his turn the giant Bergelmir, from whom all the evil frost giants  are descended.          \"Under the armpit grew,      'Tis said of Hrim-thurs,      A girl and boy together;      Foot with foot begat,      Of that wise Joetun,      A six-headed son.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).        Odin, Vili, and Ve    When these giants became aware of the existence of the god Buri, and  of his son Boerr (born), whom he had immediately produced, they began  waging war against them, for as the gods and giants represented the  opposite forces of good and evil, there was no hope of their living  together in peace. The struggle continued evidently for ages, neither  party gaining a decided advantage, until Boerr married the giantess  Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn (the thorn of evil), who bore him three  powerful sons, Odin (spirit), Vili (will), and Ve (holy). These three  sons immediately joined their father in his struggle against the  hostile frost-giants, and finally succeeded in slaying their deadliest  foe, the great Ymir. As he sank down lifeless the blood gushed from  his wounds in such floods that it produced a great deluge, in which  all his race perished, with the exception of Bergelmir, who escaped  in a boat and went with his wife to the confines of the world.          \"And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,      Save one, Bergelmer: he on shipboard fled      Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      Here he took up his abode, calling the place Joetunheim (the home of the  giants), and here he begat a new race of frost-giants, who inherited  his dislikes, continued the feud, and were always ready to sally  forth from their desolate country and raid the territory of the gods.    The gods, in Northern mythology called AEsir (pillars and supporters  of the world), having thus triumphed over their foes, and being no  longer engaged in perpetual warfare, now began to look about them,  with intent to improve the desolate aspect of things and fashion a  habitable world. After due consideration Boerr's sons rolled Ymir's  great corpse into the yawning abyss, and began to create the world  out of its various component parts.        The Creation of the Earth    Out of the flesh they fashioned Midgard (middle garden), as the earth  was called. This was placed in the exact centre of the vast space,  and hedged all round with Ymir's eyebrows for bulwarks or ramparts. The  solid portion of Midgard was surrounded by the giant's blood or sweat,  which formed the ocean, while his bones made the hills, his flat  teeth the cliffs, and his curly hair the trees and all vegetation.    Well pleased with the result of their first efforts at creation, the  gods now took the giant's unwieldy skull and poised it skilfully as  the vaulted heavens above earth and sea; then scattering his brains  throughout the expanse beneath they fashioned from them the fleecy  clouds.          \"Of Ymir's flesh      Was earth created,      Of his blood the sea,      Of his bones the hills,      Of his hair trees and plants,      Of his skull the heavens,      And of his brows      The gentle powers      Formed Midgard for the sons of men;      But of his brain      The heavy clouds are      All created.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      To support the heavenly vault, the gods stationed the strong dwarfs,  Nordri, Sudri, Austri, Westri, at its four corners, bidding them  sustain it upon their shoulders, and from them the four points of  the compass received their present names of North, South, East, and  West. To give light to the world thus created, the gods studded the  heavenly vault with sparks secured from Muspells-heim, points of light  which shone steadily through the gloom like brilliant stars. The most  vivid of these sparks, however, were reserved for the manufacture of  the sun and moon, which were placed in beautiful golden chariots.          \"And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,      Thou sent'st and fetched'st fire, and madest lights:      Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in heaven,      Dividing clear the paths of night and day.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      When all these preparations had been finished, and the steeds Arvakr  (the early waker) and Alsvin (the rapid goer) were harnessed to the  sun-chariot, the gods, fearing lest the animals should suffer from  their proximity to the ardent sphere, placed under their withers great  skins filled with air or with some refrigerant substance. They also  fashioned the shield Svalin (the cooler), and placed it in front of the  car to shelter them from the sun's direct rays, which would else have  burned them and the earth to a cinder. The moon-car was, similarly,  provided with a fleet steed called Alsvider (the all-swift); but no  shield was required to protect him from the mild rays of the moon.        Mani and Sol    The chariots were ready, the steeds harnessed and impatient to begin  what was to be their daily round, but who should guide them along  the right road? The gods looked about them, and their attention was  attracted to the two beautiful offspring of the giant Mundilfari. He  was very proud of his children, and had named them after the newly  created orbs, Mani (the moon) and Sol (the sun). Sol, the Sun-maid,  was the spouse of Glaur (glow), who was probably one of Surtr's sons.    The names proved to be happily bestowed, as the brother and sister  were given the direction of the steeds of their bright namesakes. After  receiving due counsel from the gods, they were transferred to the sky,  and day by day they fulfilled their appointed duties and guided their  steeds along the heavenly paths.          \"Know that Mundilfaer is hight      Father to the moon and sun;      Age on age shall roll away,      While they mark the months and days.\"                Havamal (W. Taylor's tr.).      The gods next summoned Nott (night), a daughter of Norvi, one of the  giants, and entrusted to her care a dark chariot, drawn by a sable  steed, Hrim-faxi (frost mane), from whose waving mane the dew and  hoarfrost dropped down upon the earth.          \"Hrim-faxi is the sable steed,      From the east who brings the night,      Fraught with the showering joys of love:      As he champs the foamy bit,      Drops of dew are scattered round      To adorn the vales of earth.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).      The goddess of night had thrice been married, and by her first husband,  Naglfari, she had had a son named Aud; by her second, Annar, a daughter  Joerd (earth); and by her third, the god Dellinger (dawn), another son,  of radiant beauty, was now born to her, and he was given the name of  Dag (day).    As soon as the gods became aware of this beautiful being's existence  they provided a chariot for him also, drawn by the resplendent white  steed Skin-faxi (shining mane), from whose mane bright beams of  light shone forth in every direction, illuminating all the world,  and bringing light and gladness to all.          \"Forth from the east, up the ascent of heaven,      Day drove his courser with the shining mane.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).        The Wolves Skoell and Hati    But as evil always treads close upon the footsteps of good, hoping to  destroy it, the ancient inhabitants of the Northern regions imagined  that both Sun and Moon were incessantly pursued by the fierce wolves  Skoell (repulsion) and Hati (hatred), whose sole aim was to overtake  and swallow the brilliant objects before them, so that the world  might again be enveloped in its primeval darkness.          \"Skoell the wolf is named      That the fair-faced goddess      To the ocean chases;      Another Hati hight      He is Hrodvitnir's son;      He the bright maid of heaven shall precede.\"                Saemuna's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).      At times, they said, the wolves overtook and tried to swallow their  prey, thus producing an eclipse of the radiant orbs. Then the terrified  people raised such a deafening clamour that the wolves, frightened by  the noise, hastily dropped them. Thus rescued, Sun and Moon resumed  their course, fleeing more rapidly than before, the hungry monsters  rushing along in their wake, lusting for the time when their efforts  would prevail and the end of the world would come. For the Northern  nations believed that as their gods had sprung from an alliance between  the divine element (Boerr) and the mortal (Bestla), they were finite,  and doomed to perish with the world they had made.          \"But even in this early morn      Faintly foreshadowed was the dawn      Of that fierce struggle, deadly shock,      Which yet should end in Ragnarok;      When Good and Evil, Death and Life,      Beginning now, end then their strife.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      Mani was accompanied also by Hiuki, the waxing, and Bil, the waning,  moon, two children whom he had snatched from earth, where a cruel  father forced them to carry water all night. Our ancestors fancied  they saw these children, the original \"Jack and Jill,\" with their pail,  darkly outlined upon the moon.    The gods not only appointed Sun, Moon, Day, and Night to mark the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#3)"],[1,"to avenge themselves.    3. Accordingly Matthias, the son of Asamoneus, one of the priests who  lived in a village called Modin, armed himself, together with his  own family, which had five sons of his in it, and slew Bacchides with  daggers; and thereupon, out of the fear of the many garrisons [of the  enemy], he fled to the mountains; and so many of the people followed  him, that he was encouraged to come down from the mountains, and to give  battle to Antiochus's generals, when he beat them, and drove them out of  Judea. So he came to the government by this his success, and became  the prince of his own people by their own free consent, and then died,  leaving the government to Judas, his eldest son.    4. Now Judas, supposing that Antiochus would not lie still, gathered an  army out of his own countrymen, and was the first that made a league of  friendship with the Romans, and drove Epiphanes out of the country when  he had made a second expedition into it, and this by giving him a great  defeat there; and when he was warmed by this great success, he made an  assault upon the garrison that was in the city, for it had not been cut  off hitherto; so he ejected them out of the upper city, and drove the  soldiers into the lower, which part of the city was called the Citadel.  He then got the temple under his power, and cleansed the whole  place, and walled it round about, and made new vessels for sacred  ministrations, and brought them into the temple, because the former  vessels had been profaned. He also built another altar, and began to  offer the sacrifices; and when the city had already received its sacred  constitution again, Antiochus died; whose son Antiochus succeeded him in  the kingdom, and in his hatred to the Jews also.    5. So this Antiochus got together fifty thousand footmen, and five  thousand horsemen, and fourscore elephants, and marched through Judea  into the mountainous parts. He then took Bethsura, which was a small  city; but at a place called Bethzacharis, where the passage was narrow,  Judas met him with his army. However, before the forces joined battle,  Judas's brother Eleazar, seeing the very highest of the elephants  adorned with a large tower, and with military trappings of gold to guard  him, and supposing that Antiochus himself was upon him, he ran a great  way before his own army, and cutting his way through the enemy's troops,  he got up to the elephant; yet could he not reach him who seemed to be  the king, by reason of his being so high; but still he ran his weapon  into the belly of the beast, and brought him down upon himself, and was  crushed to death, having done no more than attempted great things, and  showed that he preferred glory before life. Now he that governed the  elephant was but a private man; and had he proved to be Antiochus,  Eleazar had performed nothing more by this bold stroke than that it  might appear he chose to die, when he had the bare hope of thereby  doing a glorious action; nay, this disappointment proved an omen to his  brother [Judas] how the entire battle would end. It is true that the  Jews fought it out bravely for a long time, but the king's forces,  being superior in number, and having fortune on their side, obtained  the victory. And when a great many of his men were slain, Judas took the  rest with him, and fled to the toparchy of Gophna. So Antiochus went to  Jerusalem, and staid there but a few days, for he wanted provisions,  and so he went his way. He left indeed a garrison behind him, such as he  thought sufficient to keep the place, but drew the rest of his army off,  to take their winter-quarters in Syria.    6. Now, after the king was departed, Judas was not idle; for as many of  his own nation came to him, so did he gather those that had escaped out  of the battle together, and gave battle again to Antiochus's generals  at a village called Adasa; and being too hard for his enemies in the  battle, and killing a great number of them, he was at last himself slain  also. Nor was it many days afterward that his brother John had a plot  laid against him by Antiochus's party, and was slain by them.              CHAPTER 2.           Concerning The Successors Of Judas, Who Were Jonathan And       Simon, And John Hyrcanus.    1. When Jonathan, who was Judas's brother, succeeded him, he behaved  himself with great circumspection in other respects, with relation to  his own people; and he corroborated his authority by preserving his  friendship with the Romans. He also made a league with Antiochus the  son. Yet was not all this sufficient for his security; for the tyrant  Trypho, who was guardian to Antiochus's son, laid a plot against  him; and besides that, endeavored to take off his friends, and caught  Jonathan by a wile, as he was going to Ptolemais to Antiochus, with  a few persons in his company, and put him in bonds, and then made an  expedition against the Jews; but when he was afterward driven away by  Simon, who was Jonathan's brother, and was enraged at his defeat, he put  Jonathan to death.    2. However, Simon managed the public affairs after a courageous manner,  and took Gazara, and Joppa, and Jamnia, which were cities in his  neighborhood. He also got the garrison under, and demolished the  citadel. He was afterward an auxiliary to Antiochus, against Trypho,  whom he besieged in Dora, before he went on his expedition against the  Medes; yet could not he make the king ashamed of his ambition, though  he had assisted him in killing Trypho; for it was not long ere Antiochus  sent Cendebeus his general with an army to lay waste Judea, and to  subdue Simon; yet he, though he was now in years, conducted the war  as if he were a much younger man. He also sent his sons with a band of  strong men against Antiochus, while he took part of the army himself  with him, and fell upon him from another quarter. He also laid a great  many men in ambush in many places of the mountains, and was superior  in all his attacks upon them; and when he had been conqueror after so  glorious a manner, he was made high priest, and also freed the Jews from  the dominion of the Macedonians, after one hundred and seventy years of  the empire [of Seleucus].    3. This Simon also had a plot laid against him, and was slain at a feast  by his son-in-law Ptolemy, who put his wife and two sons into prison,  and sent some persons to kill John, who was also called Hyrcanus. 2  But when the young man was informed of their coming beforehand, he  made haste to get to the city, as having a very great confidence in the  people there, both on account of the memory of the glorious actions of  his father, and of the hatred they could not but bear to the injustice  of Ptolemy. Ptolemy also made an attempt to get into the city by another  gate; but was repelled by the people, who had just then admitted of  Hyrcanus; so he retired presently to one of the fortresses that were  about Jericho, which was called Dagon. Now when Hyrcanus had received  the high priesthood, which his father had held before, and had offered  sacrifice to God, he made great haste to attack Ptolemy, that he might  afford relief to his mother and brethren.    4. So he laid siege to the fortress, and was superior to Ptolemy in  other respects, but was overcome by him as to the just affection [he had  for his relations]; for when Ptolemy was distressed, he brought forth  his mother, and his brethren, and set them upon the wall, and beat them  with rods in every body's sight, and threatened, that unless he would  go away immediately, he would throw them down headlong; at which sight  Hyrcanus's commiseration and concern were too hard for his anger. But  his mother was not dismayed, neither at the stripes she received, nor  at the death with which she was threatened; but stretched out her hands,  and prayed her son not to be moved with the injuries that she suffered  to spare the wretch; since it was to her better to die by the means of  Ptolemy, than to live ever so long, provided he might be punished for  the injuries he done to their family. Now John's case was this: When  he considered the courage of his mother, and heard her entreaty, he set  about his attacks; but when he saw her beaten, and torn to pieces  with the stripes, he grew feeble, and was entirely overcome by his  affections. And as the siege was delayed by this means, the year of rest  came on, upon which the Jews rest every seventh year as they do on  every seventh day. On this year, therefore, Ptolemy was freed from being  besieged, and slew the brethren of John, with their mother, and fled to  Zeno, who was also called Cotylas, who was tyrant of Philadelphia.    5. And now Antiochus was so angry at what he had suffered from Simon,  that he made an expedition into Judea, and sat down before Jerusalem and  besieged Hyrcanus; but Hyrcanus opened the sepulcher of David, who was  the richest of all kings, and took thence about three thousand talents  in money, and induced Antiochus, by the promise of three thousand  talents, to raise the siege. Moreover, he was the first of the Jews that  had money enough, and began to hire foreign auxiliaries also.    6. However, at another time, when Antiochus was gone upon an expedition  against the Medes, and so gave Hyrcanus an opportunity of being revenged  upon him, he immediately made an attack upon the cities of Syria, as  thinking, what proved to be the case with them, that he should find them  empty of good troops. So he took Medaba and Samea, with the towns in  their neighborhood, as also Shechem, and Gerizzim; and besides these,  [he subdued] the nation of the Cutheans, who dwelt round about that  temple which was built in imitation of the temple at Jerusalem; he also  took a great many other cities of Idumea, with Adoreon and Marissa.  7. He also proceeded as far as Samaria, where is now the city Sebaste,  which was built by Herod the king, and encompassed it all round with a  wall, and"]]]
