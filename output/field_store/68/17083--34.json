Go to my cabin, I mean; I have no time to waste on inferior  prose. I plan to spend the rest of the voyage, or such part as I can  spare from my duties--\"    \"You're relieved of them,\" Iversen said grimly.    \"--working on my book. It's all about the doctrine of  _mpoola_--reincarnation, or, if you prefer, metempsychosis. The  Flimbotzi religion is so similar to many of the earlier terrestrial  theologies--Hindu, Greek, Egyptian, Southern Californian--that sometimes  one is almost tempted to stop and wonder if simplicity is not the  essence of truth.\"    Iversen knew that, for the sake of discipline, he should not, once he  had ordered Harkaway to his cabin, stop to bandy words, but he was a  chronic word-bandier, having inherited the trait from his stalwart  Viking ancestors. \"How can you have learned all about their religion,  their doctrine of reincarnation, in just four ridiculously short weeks?\"    \"It's a gift,\" Harkaway said modestly.    \"Go to your cabin, sir! No, wait a moment!\" For, suddenly overcome by a  strange, warm, utterly repulsive emotion, Iversen pointed a quivering  finger at the caterpillar. \"Did you bring along the proper food for  that--that thing? Can't have him starving, you know,\" he added gruffly.  After all, he was a humane man, he told himself; it wasn't that he found  the creature tugging at his heart-strings, or anything like that.    \"Oh, he'll eat anything we eat, sir. As long as it's not meat. All the  species on Flimbot are herbivores. I can't figure out whether the  Flimbotzik themselves are vegetarians because they practice _mpoola_, or  practice _mpoola_ because they're--\"    \"I don't want to hear another word about _mpoola_ or about Flimbot!\"  Iversen yelled. \"Get out of here! And stay away from the library!\"    \"I have already exhausted its painfully limited resources, sir.\"  Harkaway saluted with grace and withdrew to his cabin, wearing the  greech like an affectionate lei about his neck.           *       *       *       *       *    Iverson heard no more about _mpoola_ from Harkaway--who, though he did  not remain confined to his cabin when he had pursuits to pursue in other  parts of the ship, at least had the tact to keep out of the captain's  way as much as possible--but the rest of his men seemed able to talk of  nothing else. The voyage back from a star system was always longer in  relative terms than the voyage out, because the thrill of new worlds to  explore was gone; already anticipating boredom, the men were ripe for  almost any distraction.    On one return voyage, the whole crew had set itself to the study of  Hittite with very creditable results. On another, they had all devoted  themselves to the ancient art of alchemy, and, after nearly blowing up  the ship, had come up with an elixir which, although not the  quintessence--as they had, in their initial enthusiasm, alleged--proved  to be an effective cure for hiccups. Patented under the name of  Herringbone Hiccup Shoo, it brought each one of them an income which  would have been enough to support them in more than modest comfort for  the rest of their lives.    However, the adventurous life seemed to exert an irresistible lure upon  them and they all shipped upon the _Herringbone_ again--much to the  captain's dismay, for he had hoped for a fresh start with a new crew  and there seemed to be no way of getting rid of them short of reaching  retirement age.    The men weren't quite ready to accept _mpoola_ as a practical  religion--Harkaway hadn't finished his book yet--but as something very  close to it. The concept of reincarnation had always been very appealing  to the human mind, which would rather have envisaged itself perpetuated  in the body of a cockroach than vanishing completely into nothingness.    \"It's all so logical, sir,\" the first officer told Iversen. \"The  individuality or the soul or the psyche--however you want to look at  it--starts the essentially simple cycle of life as a greech--\"    \"Why as a greech?\" Iversen asked, humoring him for the moment. \"There  are lower life-forms on Flimbot.\"    \"I don't know.\" The first officer sounded almost testy. \"That's where  Harkaway starts the progression.\"    \"Harkaway! Is there no escaping that cretin's name?\"    \"Sir,\" said the first officer, \"may I speak frankly?\"    \"No,\" Iversen said, \"you may not.\"    \"Your skepticism arises less from disbelief than from the fact that you  are jealous of Harkaway because it was he who made the great discovery,  not you.\"    \"Which great discovery?\" Iversen asked, sneering to conceal his hurt at  being so overwhelmingly misunderstood. \"Flimbot or _mpoola_?\"    \"Both,\" the first officer said. \"You refuse to accept the fact that this  hitherto incompetent youth has at last blossomed forth in the lambent  colors of genius, just as the worthy greech becomes a zkoort, and the  clean-living zkoort in his turn passes on to the next higher plane of  existence, which is, in the Flimbotzik scale--\"    \"Spare me the theology, please,\" Iversen begged. \"Once a greech, always  a greech, I say. And I can't help thinking that somehow, somewhere,  Harkaway has committed some horrible error.\"    \"Humanity is frail, fumbling, futile,\" Dr. Smullyan declared, coming  upon them so suddenly that both officers jumped. \"To err is human, to  forgive divine, and I am an atheist, thank God!\"    \"That _mk'oog_ is powerful stuff,\" the first officer said. \"Or so they  tell me,\" he added.    \"This is more than mere _mk'oog_,\" Iversen said sourly. \"Smullyan has  been too long in space. It hits everyone in the long run--some sooner  than others.\"    \"Captain,\" the doctor said, ignoring these remarks as he ignored  everything not on a cosmic level, which included the crew's ailments,  \"I am in full agreement with you. Young Harkaway has doomed that pretty  little planet--\"    \"Moon,\" the first officer corrected. \"It's a satellite, not a--\"    \"We ourselves were doomed _ab origine_, but the tragic flaw inherent in  each one of our pitiful species is contagious, dooming all with whom we  come in contact. And Harkaway is the most infectious carrier on the  ship. Woe, I tell you. Woe!\" And, with a hollow moan, the doctor left  them to meditate upon the state of their souls, while he went off to his  secret stores of oblivion.    \"Wonder where he's hidden that _mk'oog_,\" Iversen brooded. \"I've turned  the ship inside out and I haven't been able to locate it.\"    The first officer shivered. \"Somehow, although I know Smullyan's part  drunk, part mad, he makes me a little nervous. He's been right so often  on all the other voyages.\"    \"Ruchbah!\" Iversen said, not particularly grateful for support from such  a dithyrambic source as the ship's medical officer. \"Anyone who  prophesies doom has a hundred per cent chance of ultimately being right,  if only because of entropy.\"    He was still brooding over the first officer's thrust, even though he  had been well aware that most of his officers and men considered him a  sorehead for doubting Harkaway in the young man's moment of triumph.  However, Iversen could not believe that Harkaway had undergone such a  radical transformation. Even on the basis of _mpoola_, one obviously had  to die before passing on to the next existence and Harkaway had been  continuously alive--from the neck down, at least.    Furthermore, all that aside, Iversen just couldn't see Harkaway going on  to a higher plane. Although he supposed the young man was well-meaning  enough--he'd grant him that negligible virtue--wouldn't it be terrible  to have a system of existence in which one was advanced on the basis of  intent rather than result? The higher life-forms would degenerate into  primitivism.    But weren't the Flimbotzik virtually primitive? Or so Harkaway had said,  for Iversen himself had not had enough contact with them to determine  their degree of sophistication, and only the spaceships gave Harkaway's  claim the lie.           *       *       *       *       *    Iversen condescended to take a look at the opening chapter of Harkaway's  book, just to see what the whole thing was about. The book began:    \"What is the difference between life and death? Can we say definitely  and definitively that life is life and death is death? Are we sure that  death is not life and life is not death?    \"No, we are not sure!    \"Must the individuality have a corporeal essence in which to enshroud  itself before it can proceed in its rapt, inexorable progress toward the  Ultimate Non-actuality? And even if such be needful, why must the  personal essence be trammeled by the same old worn-out habiliments of  error?    \"Think upon this!    \"What is the extremest intensification of individuality? It is the  All-encompassing Nothingness. Of what value are the fur, the feathers,  the skin, the temporal trappings of imperfection in our perpetual  struggle toward the final undefinable resolution into the Infinite  Interplay of Cosmic Forces?    \"Less than nothing!\"    At this point, Iversen stopped reading and returned the manuscript to  its creator, without a word. This last was less out of self-restraint  than through sheer semantic inadequacy.    The young man might have spent his time more profitably in a little  research on the biology or social organization of the Flimbotzik,  Iversen thought bitterly when he had calmed down, thus saving the next  expedition some work. But, instead, he'd been blinded by the flashy  theological aspects of the culture and, as a result, the whole crew had  gone metempsychotic.    This was going to be one of the _Herringbone's_ more unendurable  voyages, Iversen knew. And he couldn't put his foot down effectively,  either, because the crew, all being gentlemen of independent means now,  were outrageously independent.    However, in spite of knowing that all of them fully deserved what they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#3)"],[1,"  suspected may (innocently perhaps) be guilty of this fault to save  themselves the trouble of quieting their charges in a proper way. Early  impressions upon these animal passions, as well as those made upon other  senses of the young, are very abiding. Mothers be watchful!    Great care should be exercised in the choice of a diaper for infants and  the material of which it is made. The diaper should fit easily about  the organs which it covers and protects, so as not to cause undue  heating or friction of the parts; and immediately after a babe has  soiled itself either with urine or from a motion of the bowels, it  should be made clean and dry at once to avoid any irritation that would  otherwise ensue upon these delicate parts. The material of which the  diaper is made should not be stiff or harsh, but very limp, soft and  pliable; nor should it be thick and bungling. There are great objections  to the use of oil-cloth, rubber or other impervious materials as they  prevent the escape of perspiration, urine, fecal matter, etc. As soon as  possible, say near the end of the first year, the child should be taught  to use its little chair-commode, thus dispensing with the diaper at an  early age. This is much better for the sexual organs, is more  comfortable for the child and is more healthy; it also favors a more  perfect development of the limbs and joints, the hip joints  particularly.          CHAPTER III.    Childhood.      Childhood is that portion of life extending from infancy to adolescence,  which in boys occurs at the age of fourteen to sixteen years; and in  girls at the age of twelve to fourteen years. In very warm climates  adolescence is reached some two or three years earlier.    Most fortunate the infant who has completed its term of life, thus far,  in accordance with the strictest rules of Hygiene, or the laws of  health.    \"In a state of health sexual impressions should never affect a child's  mind or body. All its vital energy should be employed in constructing  the growing frame, in storing up proper external impressions and in  educating the brain to receive them.\" Unfortunately this state of health  is not always attained. Impressions may be exhibited in these organs at  a very early age either from inheritance, from improper handling or from  some morbid condition of the child that could show itself in no other  organ of the body and which, like morbid conditions in general, make  their appearance somewhere in the mind or body.    SEXUAL PRECOCITY.--Many parents who are most particular in all other  respects, as to the moral and physical training of their children,  imagine there is no need to pay any special attention to the genital  organs. This, however, is a grave mistake and needs our careful  consideration. As is well known, some children evince a sexual precocity  which may lead to very serious results. In these it often happens that  the sexual instinct arises long before puberty; such children, if males,  manifest an instinctive attraction towards the female sex which they  show by constantly spying after their nurses, chambermaids, etc.; by  seeking as much as possible to play with children of the opposite sex  and improperly toying with them. [C]\"One case is so remarkable that an  abstract of it may be instructive: M. D----, between five and six years  of age, was one day in summer in the room of a dressmaker who lived in  the family; this girl thinking that she might put herself at ease before  such a child, threw herself on her bed, almost without clothing. The  little D---- had followed all her motions and regarded her figure with a  greedy eye. He approached her on the bed, as if to sleep, but soon  became so bold in his behavior that the girl, after having laughed at  him for some time was obliged to put him out of the room. This girl's  simple imprudence produced such an impression on the child that forty  years afterwards he had not forgotten a single circumstance connected  with it.\"      [C] Lallemand and Wilson, page 140.    Parents are remarkably careless on this point. They allow children to  play together for hours at a time without the surveillance of an older  person, provided only they are removed from any danger. It is sufficient  to merely draw attention to such a custom as every reflective mind can  easily draw the inevitable consequences. Habits are indulged in and  marks of familiarity shown which should not for an instant be tolerated.    CAUSES which commonly produce sexual impressions on young children are,  allowing them to repose playfully on their belly, to slide down  bannisters, to go too long without urinating, constipation or straining  at stool, cutaneous affections, and worms. Also, thoughtless acts of  elder people which are very frequently more closely observed than is  commonly supposed. The sliding down bannisters produces a titillation  which is agreeable to the sexual organs. Children of both sexes will  constantly repeat this act until they learn to become inveterate  masturbators, even at a very early age.    Among boys a disease called _priapism_ is often developed; this arises  from undue handling of the parts, or from some morbid state of the  child's health. The disorder consists of paroxysms, occurring more or  less frequently, of violent erections of the penis; these sometimes  become very painful and require the attention of a physician. At all  events medical aid should be sought at once, because some functional  derangement is at work which might, if not arrested and cured, give rise  to masturbation. Owing to unknown causes such morbid conditions induce  some little boys to pull frequently at the foreskin of the penis until  their health is seriously impaired; they pine away, lose flesh, and  still continue to worry at the foreskin, till death has been known to  result. These cases require the most careful and skillful constitutional  treatment, until they are cured.    Sometimes, in other cases, the foreskin becomes inflamed, offensive  secretions may form about the end of the penis, etc. All such disorders  should be submitted to a judicious physician at once, to avoid  irritations which might result in a tendency to sexual excitement--a  calamity truly deplorable to the young. The idea which some writers  advance--that a long prepuce (or foreskin) often proves an exciting  cause of troublesome sensations to the boy, is certainly erroneous. So,  too, it is all wrong to state that particular care should be taken to  wash under the prepuce. That this objection in regard to washing is  true, is proved from the physical fact that in a large majority of boys  the orifice of the foreskin is not sufficiently opened to permit of  these washings. And the objection is still further proved by the fact  that all these unnatural secretions, offensive odors, sensations, etc.,  which irritate and worry a boy together with all inflammations of these  parts are soon relieved and permanently cured by the proper medicament.  Needless laving, handling or rubbing the sexual parts should be avoided  as strictly as possible. To show how little good such washings really  do, even though persisted in, I will mention one out of many similar  cases: \"In spite of repeated washings every day, a fetid smegma was  deposited in considerable quantity on the glans, causing a tiresome  burning and itching.\" All such cases are utterly intractable by any  amount of bathing. But the suitable remedy administered internally cures  the trouble permanently in a few weeks and at the same time improves  the general tone and health of the individual. This is so because the  proper remedy removes the morbific cause which produced that condition  of the penis and all concomitant symptoms, at the same time. It must be  remembered that the troubles referred to above come from within, and  that they are but developments of internal morbific causes. In a similar  manner, small pox, measles, chicken pox and all eruptive diseases come  _out_ as products from morbific causes _within_. No sane person ever  thinks of washing off these appearances with the hope of curing the  case!    All our external parts were made just as they should be and they work in  harmony so long as we are perfectly healthy inwardly. Every blemish upon  the skin, even to a wart, has a corresponding morbid influence within,  which can be removed by proper treatment. Let it be remembered then for  all coming time that a little boy's penis is never to be meddled or  trifled with, nor his foreskin, nor the parts about the generative  organs. All unnatural conditions, appearances or sensations require  prompt and proper medical aid. If erections of his little penis occur  during sleep, or if he cannot urinate promptly on rising in the  morning, because of an erection, let these conditions beget an anxiety  for his welfare and at once seek a judicious physician, who will be able  to prescribe a medicament to arrest all further development of sexual  precocity--an affliction so baneful to the young.    A little later in life children are liable to ascarides or seat worms,  called by some \"pin worms.\" No applications, purgatives, \"vermifuges,\"  injections or other mechanical means should ever be employed to remove  these, as they are of constitutional origin and should be so treated,  until perfectly cured. Removing the worms by irritants or by mechanical  means does not remove the _cause_ of their existence or reproduction in  the body. The dyscrasia that gives rise to these worms, with the  accompanying itching and tickling, is apt to cause a sexual excitement  which may prove more disastrous than the original trouble itself.  Therefore be sure that this affection is treated constitutionally; so  long as the vital forces work in harmonious order, no abnormal  appearances of any kind can come to light, because they do not exist.    From the age of nine to fourteen, boys generally acquire very curious"]]]
