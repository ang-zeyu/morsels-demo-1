[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#3)"],[1,"liasci, a noble  inhabitant of Gubbio, who has formed a catalogue of the artists of his  native city, inserted in the fourth volume of the last edition of  Vasari.    We are now arrived at the age of Giotto, and the first who presents  himself to us is Pietro Cavallini, who was instructed by Giotto, in  Rome,[8] in the arts of painting and mosaic, both of which he followed  with skill and intelligence. The Roman Guide makes mention of him, and  that of Florence refers to a Nunziata at S. Mark; and there are others  mentioned by Vasari as being in the chapels of that city; one of which  is in the Loggia del Grano. The most remarkable of his works is to be  seen in Assisi. It is a fresco, and occupies a large facade in one  division of the church. It represents the crucifixion of our Saviour,  surrounded by bands of soldiers, foot and horse, and a numerous crowd of  spectators, all varying in their dress and the expression of their  passions. In the sky is a band of angels, whose sympathizing sorrow is  vividly depicted. In extent and spirit of design it partakes of the  style of Memmi, and in one of the sufferers on the cross he has shewn  that he justly appreciated and successfully followed his guide. The  colours are well preserved, particularly the blue, which there, and in  other parts of the church, presents to our admiring gaze, to use the  language of our poets, a heaven of oriental sapphire.    Vasari does not appear to have been acquainted with any scholar of  Pietro Cavallini, except it be Giovanni da Pistoja; but Pietro, who  lived in Rome the greater part of his life, which was extended to a  period of eighty-five years, must have contributed his aid in no small  degree to the advancement of art, in the capital, as well as in other  places. However this may be, in that part of Italy, pictures of his  school are still found; or at least memorials of art of the age in which  he flourished. We have an Andrea of Velletri, of whom a specimen is  preserved in the select collection of the Museo Borgia, with the Virgin  surrounded by saints, a common subject at that period in the churches,  as I have before observed. It has the name of the painter, with the year  1334, and in execution approaches nearer to the school of Siena than any  other. In the year 1321 we find Ugolino Orvietano, Gio. Bonini di  Assisi, Lello Perugino, and F. Giacomo da Camerino, noticed by us in  another place, all employed in painting in the Cathedral of Orvieto.  Mariotti, in his letters, mentions other artists of Perugia, and the  memory of a very early painter of Fabriano is preserved by Ascevolini,  the historian of that city, who informs us, that in the country church  of S. Maria Maddalena, in his time, there was a picture in fresco, by  Bocco, executed in 1306. A Francesco Tio da Fabriano, who in 1318  painted the tribune of the Conventuals at Mondaino, is mentioned by  Colucci, (tom. xxv. p. 183). This work has perished; but the productions  of a successor of his at Fabriano are to be seen in the oratory of S.  Antonio Abate, the walls of which remain. Many histories of the saint  are there to be found, divided into pictures, in the early style, and  inscribed, _Allegrettus Nutii de Fabriano hoc opus fecit 136_.... The  art in these parts was not a little advanced by their proximity to  Assisi, where Giotto's scholars were employed after his death,  particularly Puccio Capanna of Florence. This artist, who is esteemed  one of the most successful followers of Giotto, after painting in  Florence, in Pistoia, Rimino, and Bologna, is conjectured by Vasari to  have settled in Assisi, where he left many works behind him.    We shall find the succeeding century more fruitful in art, as the Popes  at that time forsook Avignon, and, re-establishing themselves in Rome,  began to decorate the palace of the Vatican, and to employ painters of  celebrity both there and in the churches. There does not appear any  person of distinction amongst them as a native of Rome. From the Roman  State we find Gentile da Fabriano, Piero della Francesca, Bonfigli,  Vannucci, and Melozzo, who first practised the art of _sotto in su_; and  amongst the strangers are Pisanello, Masaccio, Beato Angelico,  Botticelli and his colleagues. Amongst these too, it is said, was to be  found Mantegna, and there still remains the chapel painted by him for  Innocent VIII. although since converted to another purpose. Each of  these artists I shall notice in their respective schools, and shall here  only mention such as were found in the country from the Ufente to the  Tronto, and from thence to the Metauro, which are the confines of our  present class. The names of many others may be collected from books; as  an Andrea, and a Bartolommeo, both of Orvieto, and a Mariotto da  Viterbo, and others who worked at Orvieto from 1405 to 1457; and some  who painted in Rome itself, a Giovenale and a Salli di Celano, and  others now forgotten. But without pausing on these, we will advert to  the artists of Piceno, of the State of Urbino, and the remaining parts  of Umbria: where we shall meet with the traces of schools which remained  for many years.    The school of Fabriano, which seems very ancient in Picenum, produced at  that time Gentile, one of the first painters of his age, of whom  Bonarruoti is reported to have said, that his style was in unison with  his name. The first notice we have of him is among the painters of the  church of Orvieto, in 1417; and then, or soon afterwards, he received  from the historians of that period the appellation of _magister  magistrorum_, and they mention the Madonna which he there painted, and  which still remains. He afterwards resided in Venice, where, after  ornamenting the Palazzo Publico, he was rewarded by the republic with a  salary, and with the privilege of wearing the patrician dress of that  city. He there, says Vasari, became the master, and, in a manner, the  father of Jacopo Bellini, the father and preceptor of two of the  ornaments of the Venetian school. These were Gentile, who assumed that  name in memory of Gentile da Fabriano, born in 1421; and Giovanni, who  surpassed his brother in reputation, and from whose school arose  Giorgione and Titian. He (Gentile da Fabriano) was employed in the  Lateran, at Rome, where he rivalled Pisanello, in the time of Martin V.;  and it is to be regretted that his works, both there and in Venice, have  perished. Facio, who eulogizes him, and who had seen his most finished  performances, extols him as a man of universal art, who represented, not  only the human form and edifices in the most correct manner, but painted  also the stormy appearances of nature in a style that struck terror into  the spectator. In painting the history of St. John, in the Lateran, and  the Five Prophets over it, of the colour of marble, he is said to have  used more than common care, as if he at that time prognosticated his own  approaching death, which soon afterwards occurred, and the work remained  unfinished. Notwithstanding this, Ruggier da Bruggia, as Facio relates,  when he went to Rome, in the holy year, and saw it, considered it a  stupendous work, which placed Gentile at the head of all the painters of  Italy. According to Vasari and Borghini, he executed a countless number  of works in the Marca, and in the state of Urbino, and particularly in  Gubbio, and in Citta di Castello, which are in the neighbourhood of his  native place; and there still remain in those districts, and in Perugia,  some paintings in his style. A remarkable one is mentioned in a country  church called la Romita, near Fabriano.[9] Florence possesses two  beautiful specimens: the one in S. Niccolo, with the effigy and history  of the sainted bishop, the other in the sacristy of S. Trinita, with an  Epiphany, having the date of 1423. They bear a near resemblance to the  style of B. Angelico, except that the proportions of the figures are not  so correct, the conception is less just, and the fringe of gold and  brocades more frequent. Vasari pronounces him a pupil of Beato, and  Baldinucci confirms this opinion, although he says that Beato took  religious orders at an early age in 1407, a period which would exclude  Gentile from his tuition. I conjecture both the one and the other to  have been scholars of miniature painters, from the fineness of their  execution, and from the size of their works, which are generally on a  small scale. The name of an Antonio da Fabriano appears in a  Crucifixion, in 1454, painted on wood, which I saw in Matelica, in the  possession of the Signori Piersanti; but it is inferior to Gentile in  style.[10]    On an ancient picture, which is preserved in Perugia, in the convent of  S. Domenico, is the name of a painter of Camerino, a place in the same  neighbourhood, who flourished in 1447. The inscription is _Opus Johannis  Bochatis de Chamereno_. In the same district is S. Severino, where we  find a Lorenzo, who, in conjunction with his brother, painted in the  oratory of S. John the Baptist in Urbino, the life of that saint. These  two artists were much behind their age. I have seen some other works by  them, from which it appears that they were living in 1470, and painted  in the Florentine style of 1400. Other artists of the same province are  named in the _Storia del Piceno_, particularly at S. Ginesio, a Fabio di  Gentile di Andrea, a Domenico Balestrieri, and a Stefano Folchetti,  whose works are cited, with the date of their execution attached to  them.[11] In this district also resided several strangers, scarcely  known to their native places, as Francesco d'Imola, a scholar of  Francia, who, in the convent of Cingoli, painted a Descent from the  Cross; and Carlo Crivelli, a Venetian, who passed from one state to  another, and finally settled in Ascoli. His works are to be met with  there more frequently than in any other city of Picenum. I shall speak  of his merits in the Venetian school,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#3)"],[1,"| 40.7-53.8                           | 31.4+-0.18   | 30.5+-0.17  | 46.6+-0.65                           |                           |       _H. robertmertensi_                           |  Guatemala: La Trinidad   | 30.0-33.3   | 27.3-29.8  | 44.4-50.0                           | 31.3+-0.20   | 28.5+-0.23  | 47.4+-0.46                           |             |            |  Chiapas: Acacoyagua      | 29.1-32.7   | 26.0-30.3  | 42.8-53.8                           | 31.2+-0.29   | 28.1+-0.20  | 46.5+-0.50                           |             |            |  Oaxaca: Tapanatepec      | 26.1-30.4   | 25.4-28.1  | 45.8-58.3                           | 28.4+-0.16   | 26.8+-0.14  | 52.9+-0.77                           |                           |       _H. phlebodes_                           |  Panama: Canal Zone       | 33.6-37.4   | 32.3-36.0  | 37.9-46.4                           | 34.8+-0.18   | 33.8+-0.18  | 41.6+-0.49                           |             |            |  Costa Rica: Turrialba    | 32.6-35.9   | 30.5-35.0  | 35.7-48.2                           | 34.1+-0.16   | 32.9+-0.17  | 40.1+-0.53                           |                           |       _H. sartori_                           |  Guerrero: Tierra Colorada| 29.4-31.8   | 28.9-31.0  | 42.3-52.0                           | 30.6+-0.13   | 30.0+-0.12  | 47.4+-0.59  ---------------------------------------------------------------          _Hyla microcephala microcephala_ Cope        _Hyla microcephala_ Cope, Proc.

Bull., 39:23,        November 18, 1958.      _Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe narrow, extending from nostril  along canthus, along upper edge of tympanum to groin, bordered above  by narrow white line; pair of dark brown longitudinal lines on dorsum  extending to vent; shanks having dark longitudinal line or flecks, no  transverse bars; interorbital dark mark lacking.    _Description and Variation._--The color pattern is nearly constant. Of  103 males from the Canal Zone, all lack an interorbital dark bar, and  all have a dark longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of the shank  and a narrow lateral dark stripe, bordered above by a narrow white  line, extending to the groin. The longitudinal dark lines on the  dorsum are continuous to the groin in 95 specimens and fragmented in  two specimens. In two others the lines converge and fuse in the  scapular region, and in four specimens auxiliary, fragmented lines are  present dorsolaterally.    In all specimens from southeastern Costa Rica (Golfito, Palmar Sur,  and Villa Neilly) the pattern is constant, except that in about 10 per  cent of the specimens the longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of  the shank is replaced by a row of brown flecks.    Of the limited number of Colombian specimens examined, all are  patterned normally, except three from Sautata, Choco, three from  Curumani, and three from Arcataca, Magdalena, which have flecks on the  dorsal surfaces of the shanks, and one from Espinal, Tolima, which has  no markings on the shanks.    When active at night most individuals are pale yellowish tan dorsally;  the white dorsolateral line is noticeable, but the brown lateral  stripe, dorsal brown lines, and lines on shanks are so pale that often  they are barely discernible. By day the dorsum changes to tan or pale  reddish brown; the stripes are dark brown, and the dorsolateral stripe  that is white at night becomes creamy yellow (Pl. 13). Small brown  flecks are present on the dorsum of most individuals. The venter  always is white, and the iris is pale bronze with a brown tint  immediately anterior and posterior to the pupil. In breeding males the  vocal sac is pale yellow.    _Tadpoles._--Tadpoles of this species have been found in weed-choked  ponds in eastern Panama Province. The following description is based  on KU 104097, a specimen in developmental stage 34 (Gosner, 1960).    Total length, 20.5 mm.; body length, 8.2 mm.; body slightly wider  than deep; snout pointed; nostrils large, situated dorsally, much  closer to snout than eyes, directed anteriorly; eyes moderately  small, situated dorsolaterally and directed laterally; spiracle  sinistral, located just posteroventral to eye; anal tube dextral.  Tail xiphicercal; caudal musculature moderately deep, becoming  slender posteriorly, extending beyond caudal fin; fins deepest at  about one-third distance from body to tip of tail; dorsal fin  extending onto body, deeper than deepest part of caudal  musculature; ventral fin slightly shallower than musculature.  Mouth small, terminal, lacking teeth and fringing papillae, but  having finely serrate beaks. In preservative, top of head pale  brown; dark stripe from tip of snout through eye to posterior edge  of body, narrowing to thin line on proximal one-fourth of tail;  venter white; tail creamy tan with fine black flecks most numerous  posteriorly; posterior two-thirds of fins edged with black. In  life, top of head yellowish tan; lateral stripe brown; belly  white; anterior half of tail lacking pigment; posterior half deep  orange; iris pale bronze (Pl. 15).    _Remarks._--Evidence for intergradation of _Hyla microcephala_ with  _H. underwoodi_ is provided by four specimens [USC 818 (2), 6081-2]  from 6.1 kilometers northeast of the mouth of the Rio Tarcoles, and  nine specimens [USC 8254 (2), 8255, 8256 (4), 8258 (2)] from Parrita,  both in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. These localities lie about  two-thirds the distance from the northwesternmost locality for _H.  m. microcephala_ (Palmar Sur) to the southeasternmost locality for  _H. m. underwoodi_ (Barranca). Although in most aspects of coloration  the frogs are more nearly like _H. m. underwoodi_ than _H. m.  microcephala_, some specimens have longitudinal lines on their shanks,  such as are characteristic of _H. m. microcephala_. The dorsal pattern  varies from nearly complete longitudinal lines to broken lines, fused  into an X-shaped scapular mark or not.    As noted by Rivero (1961:135), _Hyla microcephala_ seems to be closely  related to _Hyla misera_ Werner, a species having a wide distribution  east of the Andes in South America. Despite the similarity in color  pattern, size, and structure, we are reluctant to place the two taxa  in the same species until data on coloration in life, mating calls,  and life history are available for _Hyla misera_ and compared with  those of _Hyla microcephala_.    The status of Cope's _Hyla cherrei_ is questionable. Since the type,  the only specimen ever referred to the species, apparently is lost,  the only extant information regarding the taxon is contained in the  original description (Cope, 1894). There the species was characterized  as having a narrow dorsolateral white stripe and lacking pigment on  the upper arms and thighs. These characteristics of the color pattern  combined with the statements \"vomerine teeth few, opposite the middle  of the very large choanae\" and \"tympanic drum distinct, one half the  area of eye\" serve to distinguish _H. cherrei_ from all other Costa  Rican hylids, except _H. m. microcephala_ and _H. m. underwoodi_. No  statements in the type description will definitely associate _cherrei_  with one or the other of these subspecies. Since it seems obvious that  _H. cherrei_ can be associated with _H. microcephala_, we prefer to  place the name in the synonymy of the nominate subspecies, thereby  preserving the commonly used name _H. underwoodi_ (Boulenger, 1899) as  a subspecies of _H. microcephala_.    _Distribution._--_Hyla microcephala microcephala_ inhabits coastal  lowlands from the area of Golfo Dulce (apparently absent from the  Osa Peninsula) in southeastern Costa Rica eastward in Panama,  including the Azuero Peninsula to northern Colombia and thence  southward in the valleys of the Rio Cauca and Rio Magdalena in  Colombia (Fig. 1). Except for the central area of the Canal Zone  the subspecies is unknown from the Caribbean drainage in Central  America, but in Colombia the subspecies occurs only in the  Caribbean drainage. In Central America this frog occurs mostly on  the coastal lowlands; the highest recorded elevation is 560 meters  at El Valle, Cocle, Panama. Throughout most of its range _Hyla  microcephala microcephala_ occurs in disturbed habitats--cut-over  forests, secondary growth, and pastureland. It does not seem to be  an inhabitant of either primary forest or of _Curatella_-savanna.    _Specimens examined._--522, as follows: +Costa Rica+: Puntarenas:  Golfito, KU 32172-207; 3 km.
