Most would have been eager to submit  to the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But the Hans did not want them,  for they themselves had marvelous machinery and scientific process by  which all difficult labor was accomplished.    Ultimately they stopped their active search for, and annihilation of,  the widely scattered groups of now savage Americans. So long as they  remained hidden in their forests, and did not venture near the great  cities the Hans had built, little attention was paid to them.    Then began the building of the new American civilization. Families and  individuals gathered together in clans or \"gangs\" for mutual protection.  For nearly a century they lived a nomadic and primitive life, moving  from place to place, in desperate fear of the casual and occasional Han  air raids, and the terrible disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these  raids decreased, they began to stay permanently in given localities,  organizing upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of  the military households of the Norman feudal barons, except that instead  of gathering together in castles, their defense tactics necessitated a  certain scattering of living quarters for families and individuals. They  lived virtually in the open air, in the forests, in green tents,  resorting to camouflage tactics that would conceal their presence from  air observers. They dug underground factories and laboratories, that  they might better be shielded from the electrical detectors of the  Hans. They tapped the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude  instruments at first; better ones later on. They bent every effort  toward the redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored  as unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge  piecemeal, as fast as they were able to.    During the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly wars  fought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous but  childishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly punitive  raids.    But as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood  redeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs over  constantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain extent, as  between one gang and another. But the interchange of knowledge became  more important than that of goods, as skill in the handling of synthetic  processes developed.    Within the gang, an economy was developed that was a compromise between  individual liberty and a military socialism. The right of private  property was limited practically to personal possessions, but private  privileges were many, and sacredly regarded. Stimulation to achievement  lay chiefly in the winning of various kinds of leadership and  prerogatives, and only in a very limited degree in the hope of owning  anything that might be classified as \"wealth,\" and nothing that might be  classified as \"resources.\" Resources of every description, for military  safety and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the  community as a whole.    In the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had developed  a luxury economy, and with it the perfection of gilded vice and  degradation. The Americans were regarded as \"wild men of the woods.\" And  since they neither needed nor wanted the woods or the wild men, they  treated them as beasts, and were conscious of no human brotherhood with  them. As time went on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and  materials were further developed, less and less ground was needed by the  Hans for the purposes of agriculture, and finally, even the working of  mines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from  electronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.    The Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries, with machinery and  scientific processes to satisfy its every want, with virtually no  necessity of labor, began to assume a defensive attitude toward the  Americans.    And quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a deep, grim  hatred. Conscious of individual superiority as men, knowing that  latterly they were outstripping the Hans in science and civilization,  they longed desperately for the day when they should be powerful enough  to rise and annihilate the Yellow Blight that lay over the continent.    At the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely organized,  but were considering the establishment of a special military force,  whose special business it would be to harry the Hans and bring down  their air ships whenever possible without causing general alarm among  the Mongolians. This force was destined to become the nucleus of the  national force, when the Day of Retribution arrived. But that, however,  did not happen for ten years, and is another story.    [Illustration: On the left of the illustration is a Han girl, and on the  right is an American girl, who, like all of her race, is equipped with  an inertron belt and a rocket gun.]    Wilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which claimed the  entire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the leadership of Boss  Hart. Her mother and father were dead, and she was unmarried, so she was  not a \"family member.\" She lived in a little group of tents known as  Camp 17, under a woman Camp Boss, with seven other girls.    Her duties alternated between military or police scouting and factory  work. For the two-week period which would end the next day, she had been  on \"air patrol.\" This did not mean, as I first imagined, that she was  flying, but rather that she was on the lookout for Han ships over this  outlying section of the Wyoming territory, and had spent most of her  time perched in the tree tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she  would have fired a \"drop flare\" several miles off to one side, which  would ignite when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that  the direction or point from which it had been fired might not be guessed  by the airship and bring a blasting play of the disintegrator ray in her  vicinity. Other members of the air patrol would send up rockets on  seeing hers, until finally a scout equipped with an ultrophone, which,  unlike the ancient radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations,  would pass the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming  Gang and other communities within a radius of several hundred miles, not  to mention the few American rocket ships that might be in the air, and  which instantly would duck to cover either through forest clearings or  by flattening down to earth in green fields where their coloring would  probably protect them from observation. The favorite American method of  propulsion was known as \"_rocketing_.\" The _rocket_ is what I would  describe, from my 20th Century comprehension of the matter, as an  extremely powerful gas blast, atomically produced through the  stimulation of chemical action. Scientists of today regard it as a  childishly simple reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and  efficient.    But tomorrow, she explained, she would go back to work in the cloth  plant, where she would take charge of one of the synthetic processes by  which those wonderful substitutes for woven fabrics of wool, cotton and  silk are produced. At the end of another two weeks, she would be back on  military duty again, perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a \"contact  guard,\" on duty where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of  the Delawares, or the \"Susquannas\" (Susquehannas) or one of the half  dozen other \"gangs\" in that section of the country which I knew as  Pennsylvania and New York States.    Wilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps which she and  her assailants had made, and explained in the following manner, how the  inertron belt balances weight:    \"_Jumpers_\" were in common use at the time I \"awoke,\" though they were  costly, for at that time _inertron_ had not been produced in very great  quantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were belts,  strapped high under the arms, containing an amount of inertron adjusted  to the wearer's weight and purposes. In effect they made a man weigh as  little as he desired; two pounds if he liked.    \"_Floaters_\" are a later development of \"_jumpers_\"--rocket motors  encased in _inertron_ blocks and strapped to the back in such a way that  the wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly downward. With his  motor in operation, he moves like a diver, headforemost, controlling his  direction by twisting his body and by movements of his outstretched arms  and hands. Ballast weights locked in the front of the belt adjust weight  and lift. Some men prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a  slight motor thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyance balance  of a few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious  matter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an extra  precaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason, there are  built into every belt a number of detachable sections, one or more of  which can be discarded to balance off any loss in weight.    \"But who were your assailants,\" I asked, \"and why were you attacked?\"    Her assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang, referred to  as \"Bad Bloods,\" a group which for several generations had been under  the domination of conscienceless leaders who tried to advance the  interests of their clan by tactics which their neighbors had come to  regard as unfair, and who in consequence had been virtually boycotted.  Their purpose had been to slay her near the Delaware frontier, making it  appear that the crime had been committed by Delaware scouts and thus  embroil the Delawares and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each  other, or at least cause suspicions.    Fortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#3)"],[1,"people, besides making notes of our ways in  Oxfordshire.  You could hardly do better if you want to see the country.\"    I felt myself obliged to thank him, whatever might come of it; and he  added eagerly:    \"Well, then, that's settled.  I will give my friend a call; he is living in  the Guest House like you, and if he isn't up yet, he ought to be this  fine summer morning.\"    Therewith he took a little silver bugle-horn from his girdle and blew two  or three sharp but agreeable notes on it; and presently from the house  which stood on the site of my old dwelling (of which more hereafter)  another young man came sauntering towards us.  He was not so well-looking  or so strongly made as my sculler friend, being sandy-haired, rather  pale, and not stout-built; but his face was not wanting in that happy and  friendly expression which I had noticed in his friend.  As he came up  smiling towards us, I saw with pleasure that I must give up the Colney  Hatch theory as to the waterman, for no two madmen ever behaved as they  did before a sane man.  His dress also was of the same cut as the first  man's, though somewhat gayer, the surcoat being light green with a golden  spray embroidered on the breast, and his belt being of filagree silver-  work.    He gave me good-day very civilly, and greeting his friend joyously, said:    \"Well, Dick, what is it this morning?  Am I to have my work, or rather  your work?  I dreamed last night that we were off up the river fishing.\"    \"All right, Bob,\" said my sculler; \"you will drop into my place, and if  you find it too much, there is George Brightling on the look out for a  stroke of work, and he lives close handy to you.  But see, here is a  stranger who is willing to amuse me to-day by taking me as his guide  about our country-side, and you may imagine I don't want to lose the  opportunity; so you had better take to the boat at once.  But in any case  I shouldn't have kept you out of it for long, since I am due in the hay-  fields in a few days.\"    The newcomer rubbed his hands with glee, but turning to me, said in a  friendly voice:    \"Neighbour, both you and friend Dick are lucky, and will have a good time  to-day, as indeed I shall too.  But you had better both come in with me  at once and get something to eat, lest you should forget your dinner in  your amusement.  I suppose you came into the Guest House after I had gone  to bed last night?\"    I nodded, not caring to enter into a long explanation which would have  led to nothing, and which in truth by this time I should have begun to  doubt myself.  And we all three turned toward the door of the Guest  House.          CHAPTER III: THE GUEST HOUSE AND BREAKFAST THEREIN      I lingered a little behind the others to have a stare at this house,  which, as I have told you, stood on the site of my old dwelling.    It was a longish building with its gable ends turned away from the road,  and long traceried windows coming rather low down set in the wall that  faced us.  It was very handsomely built of red brick with a lead roof;  and high up above the windows there ran a frieze of figure subjects in  baked clay, very well executed, and designed with a force and directness  which I had never noticed in modern work before.  The subjects I  recognised at once, and indeed was very particularly familiar with them.    However, all this I took in in a minute; for we were presently within  doors, and standing in a hall with a floor of marble mosaic and an open  timber roof.  There were no windows on the side opposite to the river,  but arches below leading into chambers, one of which showed a glimpse of  a garden beyond, and above them a long space of wall gaily painted (in  fresco, I thought) with similar subjects to those of the frieze outside;  everything about the place was handsome and generously solid as to  material; and though it was not very large (somewhat smaller than Crosby  Hall perhaps), one felt in it that exhilarating sense of space and  freedom which satisfactory architecture always gives to an unanxious man  who is in the habit of using his eyes.    In this pleasant place, which of course I knew to be the hall of the  Guest House, three young women were flitting to and fro.  As they were  the first of the sex I had seen on this eventful morning, I naturally  looked at them very attentively, and found them at least as good as the  gardens, the architecture, and the male men.  As to their dress, which of  course I took note of, I should say that they were decently veiled with  drapery, and not bundled up with millinery; that they were clothed like  women, not upholstered like armchairs, as most women of our time are.  In  short, their dress was somewhat between that of the ancient classical  costume and the simpler forms of the fourteenth century garments, though  it was clearly not an imitation of either: the materials were light and  gay to suit the season.  As to the women themselves, it was pleasant  indeed to see them, they were so kind and happy-looking in expression of  face, so shapely and well-knit of body, and thoroughly healthy-looking  and strong.  All were at least comely, and one of them very handsome and  regular of feature.  They came up to us at once merrily and without the  least affectation of shyness, and all three shook hands with me as if I  were a friend newly come back from a long journey: though I could not  help noticing that they looked askance at my garments; for I had on my  clothes of last night, and at the best was never a dressy person.    A word or two from Robert the weaver, and they bustled about on our  behoof, and presently came and took us by the hands and led us to a table  in the pleasantest corner of the hall, where our breakfast was spread for  us; and, as we sat down, one of them hurried out by the chambers  aforesaid, and came back again in a little while with a great bunch of  roses, very different in size and quality to what Hammersmith had been  wont to grow, but very like the produce of an old country garden.  She  hurried back thence into the buttery, and came back once more with a  delicately made glass, into which she put the flowers and set them down  in the midst of our table.  One of the others, who had run off also, then  came back with a big cabbage-leaf filled with strawberries, some of them  barely ripe, and said as she set them on the table, \"There, now; I  thought of that before I got up this morning; but looking at the stranger  here getting into your boat, Dick, put it out of my head; so that I was  not before _all_ the blackbirds: however, there are a few about as good  as you will get them anywhere in Hammersmith this morning.\"    Robert patted her on the head in a friendly manner; and we fell to on our  breakfast, which was simple enough, but most delicately cooked, and set  on the table with much daintiness.  The bread was particularly good, and  was of several different kinds, from the big, rather close,  dark-coloured, sweet-tasting farmhouse loaf, which was most to my liking,  to the thin pipe-stems of wheaten crust, such as I have eaten in Turin.    As I was putting the first mouthfuls into my mouth my eye caught a carved  and gilded inscription on the panelling, behind what we should have  called the High Table in an Oxford college hall, and a familiar name in  it forced me to read it through.  Thus it ran:       \"_Guests and neighbours_, _on the site of this Guest-hall once stood     the lecture-room of the Hammersmith Socialists_.  _Drink a glass to     the memory_!  _May 1962_.\"    It is difficult to tell you how I felt as I read these words, and I  suppose my face showed how much I was moved, for both my friends looked  curiously at me, and there was silence between us for a little while.    Presently the weaver, who was scarcely so well mannered a man as the  ferryman, said to me rather awkwardly:    \"Guest, we don't know what to call you: is there any indiscretion in  asking you your name?\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"I have some doubts about it myself; so suppose you call  me Guest, which is a family name, you know, and add William to it if you  please.\"    Dick nodded kindly to me; but a shade of anxiousness passed over the  weaver's face, and he said--\"I hope you don't mind my asking, but would  you tell me where you come from?  I am curious about such things for good  reasons, literary reasons.\"    Dick was clearly kicking him underneath the table; but he was not much  abashed, and awaited my answer somewhat eagerly.  As for me, I was just  going to blurt out \"Hammersmith,\" when I bethought me what an  entanglement of cross purposes that would lead us into; so I took time to  invent a lie with circumstance, guarded by a little truth, and said:    \"You see, I have been such a long time away from Europe that things seem  strange to me now; but I was born and bred on the edge of Epping Forest;  Walthamstow and Woodford, to wit.\"    \"A pretty place, too,\" broke in Dick; \"a very jolly place, now that the  trees have had time to grow again since the great clearing of houses in  1955.\"    Quoth the irrepressible weaver: \"Dear neighbour, since you knew the  Forest some time ago, could you tell me what truth there is in the rumour  that in the nineteenth century the trees were all pollards?\"    This was catching me on my archaeological natural-history side, and I  fell into the trap without any thought of where and when I was; so I  began on it, while one of the girls, the handsome one, who had been  scattering little twigs of lavender and other sweet-smelling herbs about  the floor, came near to listen, and stood behind me with her hand on my  shoulder, in which she held some of the plant that I used to call balm:  its strong sweet smell brought back to my mind my very early days in the  kitchen-garden at Woodford, and the large blue plums which grew on the  wall beyond the sweet-herb patch,--a connection of memories which all  boys will see at once.
