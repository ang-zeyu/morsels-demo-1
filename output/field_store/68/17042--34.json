Sup-per!\" she called. \"Come now, Mr. Swift; Tom, Mr. Sharp! I  can't wait any longer! The meat and potatoes will be spoiled!\"    \"I s'pose we'd better go in,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, with something of a  sigh. \"We can finish to-morrow.\"    The shop, where certain parts of the airship were being made, was  doubly locked, and Jackson, the engineer, who was also a sort of  watchman, was bidden to keep good guard, for the fear of the gang of  unscrupulous men, who had escaped from jail during a great storm, was  still in the minds of Mr. Swift and his son.    \"And give an occasional look in the shed, where the aeroplane is,\"  advised Mr. Sharp. \"It wouldn't take much to damage that, now.\"    \"I'll pay particular attention to it,\" promised the engineer. \"Don't  worry, Mr. Sharp.\"    After supper the three gathered around the table on which were spread  out sheets of paper, covered with intricate figures and calculations,  which Mr. Swift and the balloonist went over with care. Tom was  examining some blue prints, which gave a sectional view of the proposed  ship, and was making some measurements when the bell rang, and Mrs.  Baggert ushered in Ned Newton, the most particular chum of the young  inventor.    \"Hello, Ned!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I was wondering what had become of you.  Haven't seen you in a dog's age.\"    \"That's right,\" admitted Ned. \"We've been working late nights at the  bank. Getting ready for the regular visit of the examiner, who usually  comes along about this time. Well, how are things going; and how is the  airship?\" for, of course, Ned had heard of that.    \"Oh, pretty good. Had another explosion to-day, I s'pose you heard.\"    \"No, I hadn't.\"    \"I thought everyone in town had, for Andy Foger and his two cronies  were on hand, and they usually tell all they know.\"    \"Oh, Andy Foger! He makes me sick! He was scooting up the street in his  auto just as I was coming in, 'honking-honking' his horn to beat the  band! You'd think no one ever had an auto but him. He certainly was  going fast.\"    \"Wait until I get in our airship,\" predicted Tom. \"Then I'll show you  what speed is!\"    \"Do you really think it will go fast?\"    \"Of course it will! Fast enough to catch Anson Morse and his crowd of  scoundrels if we could get on their track.\"    \"Why, I thought they were in jail,\" replied Ned, in some surprise.  \"Weren't they arrested after they stole your boat?\"    \"Yes, and put in jail, but they managed to get out, and now they're  free to make trouble for us again.\"    \"Are you sure they're out of jail?\" asked Ned, and Tom noted that his  chum's face wore an odd look.    \"Sure? Of course I am. But why do you ask?\"    Ned did not answer for a moment. He glanced at Tom's father, and the  young inventor understood. Mr. Swift was getting rather along in age,  and his long years of brain work had made him nervous. He had a great  fear of Morse and his gang, for they had made much trouble for him in  the past. Tom appreciated his chum's hesitancy, and guessed that Ned  had something to say that he did not want Mr. Swift to hear.    \"Come on up to my room, Ned. I've got something I want to show you,\"  exclaimed Tom, after a pause.    The two lads left the room, Tom glancing apprehensively at his father.  But Mr. Swift was so engrossed, together with the aeronaut, in making  some calculations regarding wind pressure, that it is doubtful if  either of the men were aware that the boys had gone.    \"Now what is it, Ned?\" demanded our hero, when they were safe in his  apartment. \"Something's up. I can tell by your manner. What is it?\"    \"Maybe it's nothing at all,\" went on his chum. \"If I had known, though  that those men had gotten out of jail, I would have paid more attention  to what I saw to-night, as I was leaving the bank to come here.\"    \"What did you see?\" demanded Tom, and his manner, which had been calm,  became somewhat excited.    \"Well, you know I've been helping the paying-teller straighten up his  books,\" went on the young bank employee, \"and when I came out to-night,  after working for several hours, I was glad enough to hurry away from  the 'slave-den,' as I call it. I almost ran up the street, not looking  where I was going, when, just as I turned the corner, I bumped into a  man.\"    \"Nothing suspicious or wonderful in that,\" commented Tom. \"I've often  run into people.\"    \"Wait,\" advised Ned. \"To save myself from falling I grabbed the man's  arm. He did the same to me, and there we stood, for a moment, right  under a gas lamp. I looked down at his hands, and I saw that on the  little finger of the left one there was tattooed a blue ring, and--\"    \"Happy Harry--the tramp!\" exclaimed Tom, now much excited. \"That's  where he wears a tattooed ring!\"    \"That's what I thought you had told me,\" resumed Ned, \"but I didn't pay  any attention to it at the time, as I had no idea that the men were out  of jail.\"    \"Well, what else happened?\" inquired Tom    \"Not much more. I apologized to the man, and he to me, and we let go of  each other.\"    \"Are you sure about the ring on his finger?\"    \"Positive. His hand was right in the light. But wait, that isn't all.  I hurried on, not thinking much about it, when, I saw another man step  out of the dark shadows of Peterby's grocery, just beyond the bank.  The man must have mistaken me for some one else, for he spoke to me.\"    \"What did he say?\"    \"He asked me a question. It was: 'Is there any chance to-night?'\"    \"What did you tell him?\"    \"Well, I was so surprised that I didn't know what to say, and, before I  could get my wits together the man had seen his mistake and hurried on.  He joined the man I had collided with, and the two skipped off in the  darkness. But not before a third man had come across the street, from  in front of the bank, and hurried off with them.\"    \"Well?\" asked Tom, as his chum paused.    \"I don't know what to think,\" resumed Ned. \"These men were certainly  acting suspiciously, and, now that you tell me the Anson Morse gang is  not locked up--well, it makes me feel that these must be some of their  crowd.\"    \"Of course they are!\" declared Tom positively. \"That blue ring proves  it!\"    \"I wouldn't go so far as to say that,\" declared Ned. \"The man certainly  had a blue ring tattooed on his finger--the same finger where you say  Happy Harry had his. But what would the men be doing in this  neighborhood? They certainly have had a lesson not to meddle with any  of your things.\"    \"No, I don't believe they are after any of dad's inventions this time.  But I tell you what I do believe.\"    \"What?\"    \"Those men are planning to rob the Shopton Bank, Ned! And I advise you  to notify the officers. That Morse gang is one of the worst in the  country,\" and Tom, much excited, began to pace the room, while Ned, who  had not dreamed of such an outcome to his narrative, looked startled.          Chapter 3    Whitewashed      \"Let's tell your father, Tom,\" suggested Ned, after a pause. \"He'll  know what to do.\"    \"No, I'd rather not,\" answered the young inventor quickly. \"Dad has had  trouble enough with these fellows, and I don't want him to worry any  more. Besides, he is working on a new invention, and if I tell him  about the Happy Harry gang it will take his attention from it.\"    \"What invention is he planning now?\"    \"I don't know, but it's something important by the way he keeps at it.  He hardly spares time to help Mr. Sharp and me on the airship. No,  we'll keep this news from dad.\"    \"Then I'll inform the bank officials, as you suggest. If the place was  robbed they might blame me; if they found out I had seen the men and  failed to tell them.\"    \"Well, that gang would only be too glad to have the blame fall on some  one else.\"    Tom little knew how near the truth he had come in his chance  expression, or how soon he himself was to fall under suspicion in  connection with this same band of bad men.    \"I'll telephone to the president on my way home,\" decided Ned, \"and he  can notify the watchman at the bank. But do you really expect to have  your airship in shape to fly soon?\"    \"Oh, yes. Now that we have found out our mistake about the gas, the  rest will be easy.\"    \"I think I'd like to take a trip in one myself, if it didn't go too  high,\" ventured Ned.    \"I'll remember that, when we have ours completed,\" promised his chum,  \"and I'll take you for a spin.\"    The boys talked for perhaps an hour longer, mostly about the airship,  for it was the latest mechanical affair in which Tom was interested,  and, naturally, foremost in his thoughts. Then Ned went home first,  however, telephoning from Tom's house to the bank president about  having seen the suspicious men. That official thanked his young  employee, and said he would take all necessary precautions. The  telephone message was not sent until Mr. Swift was out of hearing, as  Tom was determined that his father should have no unnecessary worry  about the unscrupulous men. As it was, the news that the gang was out  of jail had caused the aged inventor some alarm.    It was not without some anxiety that Tom arose the next morning,  fearing he would hear news that the bank had been broken into, but no  such alarming report circulated in Shopton. In fact having made some  inquiries that day of Ned, he learned that no trace had been seen of  the mysterious men. The police had been on the lookout, but they had  seen nothing of them.    \"Maybe, after all, they weren't the same ones,\" suggested Ned, when he  paid Tom another visit the next night.    \"Well, of course it's possible that they weren't,\" admitted the young  inventor. \"I'd be very glad to think so. Even if they were, your  encounter with them may have scared them off; and that would be a good  thing.\"    The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom and Mr. Sharp.

Small tubes  are often constricted without materially changing their outside  diameter, by a process of thickening the walls. The tube is heated  before the blast lamp, rotating it about its axis as later described,  and as it softens is gradually pushed together so as to thicken the  walls at the heated point, as in _a_, Fig. 1. When this operation has  proceeded far enough, the tube is removed from the flame, and the ends  cautiously and gently drawn apart, continuing the rotation of the tube  about its axis and taking care not to draw too rapidly at first. The  resulting tube should have a uniform exterior diameter, as shown in _b_,  Fig. 1.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Constricting a tube.]    This method of constriction is not suited to tubes much over 1/4 inch in  diameter, since the mass of glass in the constricted part becomes so  thick as to be difficult to handle when hot, and likely to crack on  cooling. Larger tubes are therefore constricted by heating in a narrow  flame, with constant rotation, and when soft, alternately gently pulling  the ends apart and pushing them together, each motion being so regulated  that the diameter of a short section of the tube is gradually reduced,  while the thickness of the wall of the reduced portion remains the same  as that of the rest of the tube, or increases only slightly. This  pulling and pushing of the glass takes place _in the flame_, while the  rotation is being continued regularly. The result may appear as  indicated in _c_, Fig. 1. The strength of the work depends upon the  thickness of the walls of the constricted portion, which should never be  less than that in the main tube, and usually a little greater. This  operation is most successful with tubing having a relatively thin wall.    =Flanging a Tube.=--This operation produces the characteristic flange  seen on test-tubes, necks of flasks, etc., the object being twofold: to  finish the end neatly and to strengthen it so that a cork may be  inserted without breaking it. This flanging may be done in several ways.  In any case the first operation is to cut the tube to a square end, and  then heat this end so that the extreme sixteenth or eighth of an inch of  it is soft and begins to shrink. The tube is of course rotated during  this heating, which should take place in a flame of slightly greater  diameter than the tube, if possible. The flange is now produced by  expanding this softened part with some suitable tool. A cone of charcoal  has been recommended for this purpose, and works fairly well, if made so  its height is about equal to the diameter of its base. The tube is  rotated and the cone, held in the other hand, is pressed into the open  end until the flange is formed. A pyramid with eight or ten sides would  probably be better than the cone.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Flanging tool.]    A better flanging tool is made from a triangular piece of copper or  brass, about 1/16 inch thick, and mounted in a suitable handle. Such a  tool is shown in Fig. 2, being cut from a sheet of copper and provided  with a handle made by wrapping asbestos paper moistened with sodium  silicate solution about the shank of the tool. It is well to have  several sizes and shapes of these tools, for different sizes of tubing.  The two sizes most used will be those having about the following  dimensions: (1) _a_ = 2 inches, _b_ = 1 inch; (2) _a_ = 1 inch, _b_ = 1  inch. When the end of the tube is softened, the tool is inserted at an  angle, as indicated in Fig. 3, and pressed against the soft part, while  the tube is quickly rotated about its axis. If the flange is  insufficient the operation may be repeated. The tool should always be  warmed in the flame before use, and occasionally greased by touching it  to a piece of wax or paraffin. After the flange is complete, the end  must be heated again to the softening temperature and cooled slowly, to  prevent it from cracking.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Flanging a tube with flanging tool.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Flanging a tube with carbon rod or wire.]    Some glass-blowers use a small carbon rod, about 3/16 inch in diameter,  as a flanging tool for tubes larger than about 3/8 inch diameter, and a  small iron wire or similar piece of metal for smaller tubes. In this  case the tube is heated as above described, and the rod or wire inserted  in the end at an angle and pressed against the softened part, as  indicated in Fig. 4, while the tube is rotated about its axis. For  large heavy tubes a larger carbon would be used.    =Rotation of the Tube.=--This is the fundamental manipulation in  glass-blowing, and upon it more than all else depends the uniformity and  finish of the work, and often the possibility of accomplishing the work  at all. Directions for it will be given on the assumption that the  reader is right-handed; if otherwise, the position of the hands is of  course reversed. The object of rotation is to insure even heating of the  whole circumference of the tube at the point of attack, to equalize the  effect of gravity on the hot glass and prevent it from falling out of  shape when soft, and to keep the parts of the tube on each side of the  heated portion in the same straight line.    In rotating the tube, both hands must be used, so that the two ends may  revolve at the same rate and the glass in the hot part not be twisted.  The rotation is performed by the thumb and first finger of each hand,  the other fingers serving to support the tube. As it is almost always  necessary to follow rotating and heating a tube by blowing it, the hands  should be so placed that it will be easy to bring the right-hand end up  to the mouth without shifting the hold on the glass. For this reason the  left hand grasps the glass with the palm down, and the right hand with  the palm turned toward the left. If there is any choice, the longer and  heavier part of the tube is usually given to the left hand, and it is  planned to blow into the shorter end. This is because it is easier to  support the tube with the hand which has the palm down. This support is  accomplished by bending the hand at the wrist so that it points slightly  downward, and then curling the second, third and little fingers in under  the tube, which is held between them and the palm. This support should  be loose enough so that the thumb and first finger can easily cause the  tube to rotate regularly on its axis, but firm enough to carry all the  weight of the tube, leaving the thumb and first finger nothing to do but  rotate it. The hand must be so turned, and the other fingers so bent,  that the thumb and first finger stretch out nearly to their full length  to grasp the tube comfortably.    The right hand is held with the palm toward the left, the fingers except  the first slightly bent, and the tube held between the first finger and  the thumb while it rests on the second finger and that portion of the  hand between the base of the first finger and the thumb. Rotation of the  tube is accomplished by rolling it between the thumbs and first fingers:  the rotation being continued in the same direction regularly, and not  reversed. It is better to roll slowly and evenly, with a series of light  touches, each of which moves the tube a little, than to attempt to turn  the tube a half a revolution or so with each motion of the hands. The  hands must be held steady, and the tube must be under good control at  all times, so that both ends may be rotated at the same angular  velocity, even though they may be of different diameters, and the tube  be neither drawn apart nor pushed together unless such a motion is  expressly desired, as it sometimes is. The hot part of the glass must be  constantly watched to see that it is uniformly rotated and not twisted,  nor pulled out or pushed together more than is desired. Care must also  be taken to keep the parts of the tube in the same straight line, or as  near it as possible, during the heating and all other manipulations.    When flanging a tube, it is held and rotated with the left hand as above  described, while the right hand holds the flanging tool.    When part of the end of a tube must be heated, as in Exercise 6, and  rotation must be very carefully performed and continued during the  blowing, both hands are used. The right hand is held as above  described, and the left hand close to it and either as above described  or else with the palm toward the right, grasping the tube in the same  way as the right hand does. This puts both hands in a position where the  tube may be blown and rotated uniformly while its axis is kept  horizontal.    Smoothness and exactness are the two things for which the beginner must  constantly strive in glass-blowing, and they are only attained by a  careful attention to the details of manipulation, with a steady hand and  watchful eye. Every move must count, and the exercise must be finished  with a minimum of reheating and retouching, for the best results.          CHAPTER III    ELEMENTARY EXERCISES      EXERCISE NO. 1    JOINING TWO PIECES OF TUBING, END TO END--FIRST METHOD    This exercise is most easily learned on tubing with an exterior diameter  of 1/4 inch, or a little less, having moderately heavy walls. A piece of  such tubing is heated before the blow-pipe at a point ten or twelve  inches from the end, and there drawn out to a capillary as previously  described (page 9). The capillary is sealed off about two inches from  the main tube, and the latter is cut near the middle. Care should be  taken to get square ends where the cut is made (page 7). The flame is  now so regulated that it is a little broader than the diameter of the  tube, the sealed half of the tube taken in the "]]]
