ADAMS, spiritualist preacher and healer, who lives at       1404 Illinois Ave., Ft. Worth, Texas, was born a slave on the James       Davis plantation, in San Jacinto Co., Texas. After the war he       worked in a grocery, punched cattle, farmed and preached. He moved       to Ft. Worth in 1902.      \"I was bo'n 93 years ago, dat is whut my mother says. We didn' keep no  record like folks does today. All I know is I been yere a long time. My  mother, she was Julia Adams and my father he was James Adams. She's bo'n  in Hollis Springs, Mississippi and my father, now den, he was bo'n in  Florida. He was a Black Creek Indian. Dere was 12 of us chillen. When I  was 'bout seven de missus, she come and gits me for her servant. I lived  in de big house till she die. Her and Marster Davis was powerful good to  me.    \"Marster Davis he was a big lawyer and de owner of a plantation. But all  I do was wait on ole missus. I'd light her pipe for her and I helped her  wid her knittin'. She give me money all de time. She had a little trunk  she keeped money in and lots of times I'd have to pack it down wid my  feets.    \"I dis'member jus' how many slaves dere was, but dere was more'n 100. I  saw as much as 100 sold at a time. When dey tuk a bunch of slaves to  trade, dey put chains on 'em.    \"De other slaves lived in log cabins back of de big house. Dey had dirt  floors and beds dat was made out of co'n shucks or straw. At nite dey  burned de lamps for 'bout an hour, den de overseers, dey come knock on  de door and tell 'em put de light out. Lots of overseers was mean.  Sometimes dey'd whip a nigger wid a leather strap 'bout a foot wide and  long as your arm and wid a wooden handle at de end.    \"On Sat'day and Sunday nites dey'd dance and sing all nite long. Dey  didn' dance like today, dey danced de roun' dance and jig and do de  pigeon wing, and some of dem would jump up and see how many time he  could kick his feets 'fore dey hit de groun'. Dey had an ole fiddle and  some of 'em would take two bones in each hand and rattle 'em. Dey sang  songs like, 'Diana had a Wooden Leg,' and 'A Hand full of Sugar,' and  'Cotton-eyed Joe.' I dis'member how dey went.    \"De slaves didn' have no church den, but dey'd take a big sugar kettle  and turn it top down on de groun' and put logs roun' it to kill de  soun'. Dey'd pray to be free and sing and dance.    \"When war come dey come and got de slaves from all de plantations and  tuk 'em to build de breastworks. I saw lots of soldiers. Dey'd sing a  song dat go something like dis:    \"'Jeff Davis rode a big white hoss,  Lincoln rode a mule;  Jess Davis is our President,  Lincoln is a fool.'    \"I 'member when de slaves would run away. Ole John Billinger, he had a  bunch of dogs and he'd take after runaway niggers. Sometimes de dogs  didn' ketch de nigger. Den ole Billinger, he'd cuss and kick de dogs.    \"We didn' have to have a pass but on other plantations dey did, or de  paddlerollers would git you and whip you. Dey was de poor white folks  dat didn' have no slaves. We didn' call 'em white folks dem days. No,  suh, we called dem' Buskrys.'    \"Jus' fore de war, a white preacher he come to us slaves and says: 'Do  you wan' to keep you homes whar you git all to eat, and raise your  chillen, or do you wan' to be free to roam roun' without a home, like de  wil' animals? If you wan' to keep you homes you better pray for de South  to win. All day wan's to pray for de South to win, raise the  hand.' We all raised our hands 'cause we was skeered not to, but we sho'  didn' wan' de South to win.    \"Dat night all de slaves had a meetin' down in de hollow. Ole Uncle  Mack, he gits up and says: 'One time over in Virginny dere was two ole  niggers, Uncle Bob and Uncle Tom. Dey was mad at one 'nuther and one day  dey decided to have a dinner and bury de hatchet. So day sat  down, and when Uncle Bob wasn't lookin' Uncle Tom put some poison in  Uncle Bob's food, but he saw it and when Uncle Tom wasn't lookin', Uncle  Bob he turned de tray roun' on Uncle Tom, and he gits de poison food.'  Uncle Mack, he says: 'Dat's what we slaves is gwine do, jus' turn de  tray roun' and pray for de North to win.'    \"After de war dere was a lot of excitement 'mong de niggers. Dey was  rejoicin' and singin'. Some of 'em looked puzzled, sorter skeered like.  But dey danced and had a big jamboree.    \"Lots of 'em stayed and worked on de halves. Others hired out. I went to  work in a grocery store and he paid me $1.50 a week. I give my mother de  dollar and keeped de half. Den I got married and farmed for awhile. Den  I come to Fort Worth and I been yere since.          420198           SARAH ALLEN was born a slave of John and Sally Goodren, in the Blue       Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Before the Civil War, her owners came       to Texas, locating near a small town then called Freedom. She lives       at 3322 Frutas St., El Paso, Texas.      \"I was birthed in time of bondage. You know, some people are ashamed to  tell it, but I thank God I was 'llowed to see them times as well as now.  It's a pretty hard story, how cruel some of the marsters was, but I had  the luck to be with good white people. But some I knew were put on the  block and sold. I 'member when they'd come to John Goodren's place to  buy, but he not sell any. They'd have certain days when they'd sell off  the block and they took chillen 'way from mothers, screamin' for dere  chillen.    \"I was birthed in ole Virginia in de Blue Ridge Mountains.

My missus would see her people had something good  to eat every Sunday mornin'. You had to mind your missus and marster and  you be treated well. I think I was about twelve when dey freed us and we  stayed with marster 'bout a year, then went to John Ecols' place and  rented some lan'. We made two bales of cotton and it was the first money  we ever saw.    \"Back when we lived with Marster Goodren we had big candy pullin's.  Invite everybody and play. We had good times. De worst thing, we didn'  never have no schoolin' till after I married. Den I went to school two  weeks. My husban' was teacher. He never was a slave. His father bought  freedom through a blacksmith shop, some way.    \"I had a nice weddin'. My dress was white and trimmed with blue ribbon.  My second day dress was white with red dots. I had a beautiful veil and  a wreath and 'bout two, three waiters for table dat day.    \"My mother was nearly white. Brighter than me. We lef' my father in  Virginia.

During the Civil War, Andy was       sold to W.T. House, of Blanco County, who in less than a year sold       Andy to his brother, John House.

He shuns the society of man. The thick and gloomy forests are  preferred by the Houton. In those far extending wilds, about day-break,  you hear him call in distinct and melancholy tone, \"Houton, Houton!\"  An observer says, \"Move cautiously to the place from which the sound  proceeds, and you will see him sitting in the underwood, about a couple  of yards from the ground, his tail moving up and down every time he  articulates \"Houton!\".\"    The Mot Mot lives on insects and berries found among the underwood, and  very rarely is seen in the lofty trees. He makes no nest, but rears his  young in a hole in the sand, generally on the side of a hill.    Mr. Osbert Salvin tells this curious anecdote: \"Some years ago the  Zoological Society possessed a specimen which lived in one of the large  cages of the parrot house by itself. I have a very distinct recollection  of the bird, for I used every time I saw it to cheer it up a bit by  whistling such of its notes as I had picked up in the forests of  America. The bird always seemed to appreciate this attention, for  although it never replied, it became at once animated, hopped about the  cage, and swung its tail from side to side like the pendulum of a clock.  For a long time its tail had perfect spatules, but toward the end of its  life I noticed that the median feathers were no longer trimmed with such  precision, and on looking at its beak I noticed that from some cause or  other it did not close properly, gaped slightly at the tip, and had thus  become unfitted for removing the vanes of the feathers.\"          KING PARROT OR KING LORY.      Lory is the name of certain birds, mostly from the Moluccas and New  Guinea, which are remarkable for their bright scarlet or crimson  coloring, though also applied to some others in which the plumage is  chiefly green. Much interest has been excited by the discovery of  Dr. A. B. Meyer that the birds of this genus having a red plumage are  the females of those wearing green feathers. For a time there was much  difference of opinion on this subject, but the assertion is now  generally admitted.    They are called \"brush-tongued\" Parrots. The color of the first plumage  of the young is still unsettled. This bird is a favorite among bird  fanciers, is readily tamed, and is of an affectionate nature. It can be  taught to speak very creditably, and is very fond of attracting the  attention of strangers and receiving the caresses of those whom it  likes.    There are few things a parrot prefers to nuts and the stones of various  fruits. Wood says he once succeeded in obtaining the affections of a  Parisian Parrot, solely through the medium of peach stones which he  always saved for the bird and for which it regularly began to gabble as  soon as it saw him coming. \"When taken freshly from the peach,\" he says,  \"the stones are very acceptable to the parrot, who turns them over,  chuckling all the while to show his satisfaction, and picking all the  soft parts from the deep indentations in the stone.\" He used to crack  the stone before giving it to the bird, when his delight knew no bounds.  They are fond of hot condiments, cayenne pepper or the capsicum pod. If  a bird be ailing, a capsicum will often set it right again.    The parrot is one of the hardiest of birds when well cared for and  will live to a great age. Some of these birds have been known to attain  an age of seventy years, and one seen by Vaillant had reached the  patriarchal age of ninety three. At sixty its memory began to fail, at  sixty-five the moult became very irregular and the tail changed to  yellow. At ninety it was a very decrepit creature, almost blind and  quite silent, having forgotten its former abundant stock of words.    A gentleman once had for many years a parrot of seemingly rare  intelligence. It was his custom during the summer to hang the parrot's  cage in front of his shop in a country village, where the bird would  talk and laugh and cry, and condole with itself. Dogs were his special  aversion and on occasions when he had food to spare, he would drop it  out of the cage and whistle long and loud for them. When the dogs had  assembled to his satisfaction he would suddenly scream in the fiercest  accents, \"Get out, dogs!\" and when they had scattered in alarm his  enjoyment of it was demonstrative. This parrot's vocabulary, however,  was not the most refined, his master having equipped him with certain  piratical idioms.    According to authority, the parrot owner will find the health of his pet  improved and its happiness promoted by giving it, every now and then, a  small log or branch on which the mosses and lichens are still growing.  Meat, fish, and other similar articles of diet are given with evil  effects.    It is impossible for anyone who has only seen these birds in a cage or  small inclosure to conceive what must be the gorgeous appearance of a  flock, either in full flight, and performing their various evolutions,  under a vertical sun, or sporting among the superb foliage of a tropical  forest which, without these, and other brilliant tenants, would present  only a solitude of luxuriant vegetation.          [Illustration: KING PARROT.]          THE AMERICAN ROBIN.    The Bird of the Morning.      Yes, my dear readers, I am the bird of the morning. Very few of you rise  early enough to hear my first song. By the time you are awake our little  ones have had their breakfast, Mrs. Robin and I have had our morning  bath and we are all ready to greet you with our morning song.    I wonder if any of you have seen our nest and can tell the color of the  eggs that Mrs. Robin lays. Some time I will let you peep into the nest  and see them, but of course you will not touch them.    I wonder, too, if you know any of my cousins--the Mocking bird, the  Cat-bird or the Brown Thrush--I think I shall ask them to have their  pictures taken soon and talk to you about our gay times.    Did you ever see one of my cousins on the ground? I don't believe you  can tell how I move about. Some of you may say I run, and some of you  may say I hop, and others of you may say I do both. Well, I'll tell you  how to find out. Just watch me and see. My little friends up north won't  be able to see me though until next month, as I do not dare leave the  warm south until Jack Frost leaves the ground so I can find worms to  eat.    I shall be about the first bird to visit you next month and I want you  to watch for me. When I do come it will be to stay a long time, for I  shall be the last to leave you. Just think, the first to come and last  to leave. Don't you think we ought to be great friends? Let us get  better acquainted when next we meet. Your friend,                                                  ROBIN.          How do the robins build their nest?      Robin Red Breast told me,      First a wisp of yellow hay      In a pretty round they lay;      Then some shreds of downy floss,      Feathers too, and bits of moss,      Woven with a sweet, sweet song,      This way, that way, and across:      That's what Robin told me.        Where do the robins hide their nest?      Robin Red Breast told me,      Up among the leaves so deep,      Where the sunbeams rarely creep,      Long before the winds are cold,      Long before the leaves are gold      Bright-eyed stars will peep and see      Baby Robins--one, two, three:      That's what Robin told me.          THE AMERICAN ROBIN.    \"Come, sweetest of the feathered throng.\"      Our American Robin must not be confounded with the English Robin  Redbreast, although both bear the same name. It is the latter bird in  whose praise so much has been written in fable and song. The American  Robin belongs to the Thrush family; the Mocking bird, Cat-bird and Brown  Thrush, or Thrasher, being other familiar children. In this family, bird  organization reaches its highest development. This bird is larger than  his English cousin the Redbreast and many think has a finer note than  any other of the Thrush family.    The Robin courts the society of man, following close upon the plow and  the spade and often becoming quite tame and domestic. It feeds for a  month or two on strawberries and cherries, but generally on worms and  insects picked out of the ground. It destroys the larvae of many insects  in the soil and is a positive blessing to man, designed by the Creator  for ornament and pleasure, and use in protecting vegetation. John  Burroughs, the bird lover, says it is the most native and democratic of  our birds.    It is widely diffused over the country, migrating to milder climates in  the Winter. We have heard him in the early dawn on Nantucket Island  welcoming the coming day, in the valleys of the Great and the little  Miami, in the parks of Chicago, and on the plains of Kansas, his song  ever cheering and friendly. It is one of the earliest heralds of Spring,  coming as early as March or April, and is one of the latest birds to  leave us in Autumn. Its song is a welcome prelude to the general concert  of Summer.        \"When Robin Redbreast sings,       We think on budding Springs.\"    The Robin is not one of our most charming songsters, yet its carol is  sweet, hearty and melodious. Its principal song is in the morning  before sunrise, when it mounts the top of some tall tree, and with its  wonderful power of song, announces the coming of day. When educated, it  imitates the sounds of various birds, and even sings tunes. It must be  amusing to hear it pipe out so solemn a strain as Old Hundred.    It has no remarkable habits. It shows considerable courage and anxiety  for its young, and is a pattern of propriety when keeping house and  concerned with the care of its offspring. Two broods are often reared  out of the same nest. In the Fall these birds become restless and  wandering, often congregating in large flocks, when, being quite fat,  they are much esteemed as food.    The Robin's nest is sometimes"]]]
