In the second and third contests she fared no better, and so she  had to become King Gunther's bride. But she said that before she  would leave Iceland she must tell all her kinsmen. Daily her kinsfolk  came riding to the castle, and soon an army had assembled.    Then Gunther and his friends feared unfair play. So Siegfried put  on his cap of darkness, stepped into a boat, and went to the Nibelung  land where Alberich the dwarf was guarding the wonderful Nibelung  treasure.    \"Bring me here,\" he cried to the dwarf, \"a thousand Nibelung knights.\"  At the call of the dwarf the warriors gathered around Sir Siegfried.  Then they sailed with him to Brunhilda's isle and the queen and her  kinsmen, fearing such warriors, welcomed them instead of fighting.  Soon after their arrival King Gunther and his men, Siegfried and his  Nibelungs, and Queen Brunhilda, with two thousand of her kinsmen  set sail for King Gunther's land.    As soon as they reached Worms the marriage of Gunther and Brunhilda  took place. Siegfried and Kriemhilda also were married, and after  their marriage went to Siegfried's Netherlands castle. There they  lived more happily than I can tell.    IV    Now comes the sad part of the Nibelung tale.    Brunhilda and Gunther invited Siegfried and Kriemhilda to visit them  at Worms. During the visit the two queens quarreled and Brunhilda  made Gunther angry with Siegfried. Hagen, too, began to hate Siegfried  and wished to kill him.    But Siegfried could not be wounded except in one spot on which  a falling leaf had rested when he bathed himself in the dragon's  blood. Only Kriemhilda knew where this spot was. Hagen told her to  sew a little silk cross upon Siegfried's dress to mark the spot,  so that he might defend Siegfried in a fight.    No battle was fought, but Siegfried went hunting with Gunther and  Hagen one day and they challenged him to race with them. He easily  won, but after running he was hot and thirsty and knelt to drink  at a spring. Then Hagen seized a spear and plunged it through the  cross into the hero's body. Thus the treasure of the Nibelungs  brought disaster to Siegfried.    Gunther and Hagen told Kriemhilda that robbers in the wood had slain  her husband, but she could not be deceived.    [Illustration: THE BODY OF SIEGFRIED IS CARRIED TO WORMS]    Kriemhilda determined to take vengeance on the murderers of Siegfried,  and so she would not leave Worms. There, too, stayed one thousand  knights who had followed Siegfried from the Nibelung land.    Soon after Siegfried's death Kriemhilda begged her younger brother  to bring the Nibelung treasure from the mountain cave to Worms.    When it arrived Kriemhilda gave gold and jewels to rich and poor  in Burgundy, and Hagen feared that soon she would win the love of  all the people and turn them against him. So, one day, he took  the treasure and hid it in the Rhine. He hoped some day to enjoy  it himself.    As Hagen now possessed the Nibelung treasure the name \"Nibelungs\"  was given to him and his companions.    V    Etzel, or as we call him, Attila, king of the Huns, heard of the  beauty of Kriemhilda and sent one of his knights to ask the queen  to become his wife.    At first she refused. However, when she remembered that Etzel carried  the sword of Tiew, she changed her mind, because, if she became  his wife, she might persuade him to take vengeance upon Gunther  and Hagen.    And so it came to pass.    Shortly after their marriage Etzel and Kriemhilda invited Gunther  and all his court to a grand midsummer festival in the land of  the Huns.    Hagen was afraid to go, for he felt sure that Kriemhilda had not  forgiven the murder of Siegfried. However, it was decided that  the invitation should be accepted, but that ten thousand knights  should go with Gunther as a body-guard.    Shortly after Gunther and his followers arrived at Attila's court  a banquet was prepared. Nine thousand Burgundians were seated at  the board when Attila's brother came into the banquet hall with a  thousand well-armed knights. A quarrel arose and a fight followed.    Thousands of the Burgundians were slain. The struggle continued  for days. At last, of all the knights of Burgundy, Gunther and  Hagen alone were left alive. Then one of Kriemhilda's friends fought  with them and overpowered both. He bound them and delivered them  to Kriemhilda.    The queen ordered one of her knights to cut off Gunther's head, and  she herself cut off the head of Hagen with \"Balmung,\" Siegfried's  wonderful sword. A friend of Hagen then avenged his death by killing  Kriemhilda herself.    Of all the Nibelungs who entered the land of the Huns one only ever  returned to Burgundy.      FAMOUS MEN OF THE MIDDLE AGES           *       *       *       *       *    ALARIC THE VISIGOTH    KING FROM 394-410 A.D.    I    Long before the beginning of the period known as the Middle Ages  a tribe of barbarians called the Goths lived north of the River  Danube in the country which is now known as Roumania. It was then a  part of the great Roman Empire, which at that time had two capitals,  Constantinople--the new city of Constantine--and Rome. The Goths  had come from the shores of the Baltic Sea and settled on this  Roman territory, and the Romans had not driven them back.    During the reign of the Roman Emperor Va'lens some of the Goths  joined a conspiracy against him. Valens punished them for this  by crossing the Danube and laying waste their country. At last  the Goths had to beg for mercy. The Gothic chief was afraid to  set foot on Roman soil, so he and Valens met on their boats in the  middle of the Danube and made a treaty of peace.    [Illustration: THE MEETING BETWEEN VALENS AND THE GOTHIC CHIEF ON  THE DANUBE]    For a long time the Goths were at war with another tribe of barbarians  called Huns. Sometimes the Huns defeated the Goths and drove them  to their camps in the mountains. Sometimes the Goths came down  to the plains again and defeated the Huns.    At last the Goths grew tired of such constant fighting and thought  they would look for new settlements. They sent some of their leading  men to the Emperor Valens to ask permission to settle in some country  belonging to Rome. The messengers said to the emperor:    \"If you will allow us to make homes in the country south of the  Danube we will be friends of Rome and fight for her when she needs  our help.\"    The emperor at once granted this request. He said to the Gothic  chiefs:    \"Rome always needs good soldiers. Your people may cross the Danube  and settle on our land. As long as you remain true to Rome we will  protect you against your enemies.\"    These Goths were known as Visigoths, or Western Goths. Other tribes  of Goths who had settled in southern Russia, were called Ostrogoths,  or Eastern Goths.    After getting permission from the Emperor Valens a large number  of the Visigoths crossed the Danube with their families and their  cattle and settled in the country now called Bulgaria.    In course of time they became a very powerful nation, and in the  year 394 they chose as their king one of the chiefs named Al'a-ric.  He was a brave man and a great soldier. Even when a child he took  delight in war, and at the age of sixteen he fought as bravely  as the older soldiers.    One night, not long after he became king, Alaric had a very strange  dream. He thought he was driving in a golden chariot through the  streets of Rome amid the shouts of the people, who hailed him as  emperor. This dream made a deep impression on his mind. He was  always thinking of it, and at last he began to have the idea that  he could make the dream come true.    \"To be master of the Roman Empire,\" he said to himself, \"that is  indeed worth trying for; and why should I not try? With my brave  soldiers I can conquer Rome, and I shall make the attempt.\"    So Alaric called his chiefs together and told them what he had made  up his mind to do.    The chiefs gave a cry of delight for they approved of the king's  proposal. In those days fighting was almost the only business of  chiefs, and they were always glad to be at war, especially when  there was hope of getting rich spoils. And so the Visigoth chiefs  rejoiced at the idea of war against Rome, for they knew that if  they were victorious they would have the wealth of the richest  city of the world to divide among themselves.    [Illustration: ALARIC AT ATHENS]    Soon they got ready a great army. With Alaric in command, they  marched through Thrace and Macedonia and before long reached Athens.  There were now no great warriors in Athens, and the city surrendered  to Alaric. The Goths plundered the homes and temples of the Athenians  and then marched to the state of Elis, in the southwestern part  of Greece. Here a famous Roman general named Stil'i-cho besieged  them in their camp. Alaric managed to force his way through the  lines of the Romans and escaped. He marched to Epirus. This was  a province of Greece that lay on the east side of the Ionian Sea.  Arcadius, the Emperor of the East, now made Alaric governor of this  district and a large region lying near it. The whole territory  was called Eastern Illyricum and formed part of the Eastern Empire.    II    Alaric now set out to make an attack on Rome, the capital of the  Western Empire. As soon as Honorius, Emperor of the West, learned  that Alaric was approaching, he fled to a strong fortress among  the mountains of North Italy. His great general Stilicho came to  his rescue and defeated Alaric near Verona. But even after this  Honorius was so afraid of Alaric that he made him governor of a  part of his empire called Western Illyricum and gave him a large  yearly income.    Honorius, however, did not keep certain of his promises to Alaric,  who consequently, in the year 408, marched to Rome and besieged  it.

In 1362  he revisited Naples, and in the following year spent three months with  Petrarch at Venice. In 1365 he was sent by the Republic of Florence on a  mission of conciliation to Pope Urban V. at Avignon. He was employed on a  like errand on the Pope's return to Rome in 1367. In 1368 he revisited  Venice, and in 1371 Naples; but in May 1372 he returned to Florence, where  on 25th August 1373 he was appointed lecturer on the Divina Commedia, with  a yearly stipend of 100 fiorini d'oro. His lectures, of which the first  was delivered in the church of San Stefano near the Ponte Vecchio, were  discontinued owing to ill health, doubtless aggravated by the distress which  the death of Petrarch (20th July 1374) could not but cause him, when he had  got no farther than the seventeenth Canto of the Inferno. His commentary is  still occasionally quoted. He died, perhaps in the odour of sanctity, for  in later life he was a diligent collector of relics, at Certaldo on 21st  December 1375, and was buried in the parish church. His tomb was desecrated,  and his remains were dispersed, owing, it is said, to a misunderstanding,  towards the close of the eighteenth century. His library, which by his  direction was placed in the Convent of Santo Spirito at Florence, was  destroyed by fire about a century after his death.    Besides the De Genealogia Deorum Boccaccio wrote other treatises in Latin,  which need not here be specified, and sixteen Eclogues in the same language,  of which he was by no means a master. As for his minor works in the  vernacular, the earlier of them shew that he had not as yet wrought himself  free from the conventionalism which the polite literature of Italy inherited  from the Sicilians. It is therefore inevitable that the twentieth century  should find the Filocopo, Ameto, and Amorosa Visione tedious reading. The  Teseide determined the form in which Pulci, Boiardo, Bello, Ariosto, Tasso,  and, with a slight modification, our own Spenser were to write, but its  readers are now few, and are not likely ever again to be numerous. Chaucer  drew upon it for the Knight's Tale, but it is at any rate arguable that his  retrenchment of its perhaps inordinate length was judicious, and that what  he gave was better than what he borrowed. Still, that it had such a redactor  as Chaucer is no small testimony to its merit; nor was it only in the  Knight's Tale that he was indebted to it: the description of the Temple of  Love in the Parlement of Foules is taken almost word for word from it. Even  more considerable and conspicuous is Chaucer's obligation to Boccaccio in  the Troilus and Criseyde, about a third of which is borrowed from the  Filostrato. Nor is it a little remarkable that the same man, that in the  Teseide and Filostrato founded the chivalrous epic, should also and in the  same period of his literary activity, have written the first and not the  least powerful and artistic of psychologic romances, for even such is  L'Amorosa Fiammetta.    But whatever may be the final verdict of criticism upon these minor works of  Boccaccio, it is impossible to imagine an age in which the Decameron will  fail of general recognition as, in point alike of invention as of style, one  of the most notable creations of human genius. Of few books are the sources  so recondite, insomuch that it seems to be certain that in the main they  must have be merely oral tradition, and few have exercised so wide and  mighty an influence. The profound, many-sided and intimate knowledge of  human nature which it evinces, its vast variety of incident, its wealth  of tears and laughter, its copious and felicitous diction, inevitably apt  for every occasion, and, notwithstanding the frequent harshness, and  occasional obscurity of its at times tangled, at times laboured periods,  its sustained energy and animation of style must ever ensure for this human  comedy unchallenged rank among the literary masterpieces that are truly  immortal.    The Decameron was among the earliest of printed books, Venice leading the  way with a folio edition in 1471, Mantua following suit in 1472, and  Vicenza in 1478. A folio edition, adorned, with most graceful wood-  engravings, was published at Venice in 1492. Notwithstanding the freedom  with which in divers passages Boccaccio reflected on the morals of the  clergy, the Roman Curia spared the book, which the austere Savonarola  condemned to the flames. The tradition that the Decameron was among the  pile of \"vanities\" burned by Savonarola in the Piazza della Signoria on  the last day of the Carnival of 1497, little more than a year before he  was himself burned there, is so intrinsically probable--and accords so  well with the extreme paucity of early copies of the work--that it would  be the very perversity of scepticism to doubt it. It is by no means to  the credit of our country that, except to scholars, it long remained in  England, an almost entirely closed book. (2) Indeed the first nominally  complete English translation, a sadly mutilated and garbled rendering of  the French version by Antoine Le Macon, did not appear till 1620, and  though successive redactions brought it nearer to the original, it  remained at the best but a sorry faute de mieux. Such as it was,  however, our forefathers were perforce fain to be content with it.    The first Englishman to render the whole Decameron direct from the Italian  was Mr. John Payne; but his work, printed for the Villon Society in 1886,  was only for private circulation, and those least inclined to disparage  its merits may deem its style somewhat too archaic and stilted adequately  to render the vigour and vivacity of the original. Accordingly in the  present version an attempt has been made to hit the mean between archaism  and modernism, and to secure as much freedom and spirit as is compatible  with substantial accuracy.    (1) As to the palaces in which the scene is laid, Manni (Istoria del  Decamerone, Par. ii. cap. ii.) identifies the first with a villa near  Fiesole, which can be no other than the Villa Palmieri, and the second (ib.  cap. lxxvi.) with the Podere della Fonte, or so-called Villa del Boccaccio,  near Camerata. Baldelli's theory, adopted by Mrs. Janet Ann Ross (Florentine  Villas, 1901), that the Villa di Poggio Gherardi was the first, and the  Villa Palmieri the second, retreat is not to be reconciled with Boccaccio's  descriptions. The Villa Palmieri is not remote enough for the second and  more sequestered retreat, nor is it, as that is said to have been, situate  on a low hill amid a plain, but on the lower Fiesolean slope. The most  rational supposition would seem to be that Boccaccio, who had seen many a  luxurious villa, freely combined his experiences in the description of his  palaces and pleasaunces, and never expected to be taken au pied de la  lettre.    (2) Nevertheless Shakespeare derived indirectly the plot of All's Well that  Ends Well from the Ninth Novel of the Third Day, and an element in the plot  of Cymbeline from the Ninth Novel of the Second Day.      --  Beginneth here the book called Decameron, otherwise Prince Galeotto, wherein  are contained one hundred novels told in ten days by seven ladies and three  young men.  --    PROEM    'Tis humane to have compassion on the afflicted and as it shews well in all,  so it is especially demanded of those who have had need of comfort and have  found it in others: among whom, if any had ever need thereof or found it  precious or delectable, I may be numbered; seeing that from my early youth  even to the present I was beyond measure aflame with a most aspiring and  noble love (1) more perhaps than, were I to enlarge upon it, would seem to  accord with my lowly condition. Whereby, among people of discernment to  whose knowledge it had come, I had much praise and high esteem, but  nevertheless extreme discomfort and suffering not indeed by reason of  cruelty on the part of the beloved lady, but through superabundant ardour  engendered in the soul by ill-bridled desire; the which, as it allowed me no  reasonable period of quiescence, frequently occasioned me an inordinate  distress. In which distress so much relief was afforded me by the delectable  discourse of a friend and his commendable consolations, that I entertain a  very solid conviction that to them I owe it that I am not dead. But, as it  pleased Him, who, being infinite, has assigned by immutable law an end to  all things mundane, my love, beyond all other fervent, and neither to be  broken nor bent by any force of determination, or counsel of prudence, or  fear of manifest shame or ensuing danger, did nevertheless in course of time  me abate of its own accord, in such wise that it has now left nought of  itself in my mind but that pleasure which it is wont to afford to him who  does not adventure too far out in navigating its deep seas; so that, whereas  it was used to be grievous, now, all discomfort being done away, I find that  which remains to be delightful. But the cessation of the pain has not  banished the memory of the kind offices done me by those who shared by  sympathy the burden of my griefs; nor will it ever, I believe, pass from me  except by death. And as among the virtues, gratitude is in my judgment most  especially to be commended, and ingratitude in equal measure to be censured,  therefore, that I show myself not ungrateful, I have resolved, now that I  may call myself to endeavour, in return for what I have received, to afford,  so far as in me lies, some solace, if not to those who succoured and who,  perchance, by reason of their good sense or good fortune, need it not, at  least to such as may be apt to receive it.    And though my support or comfort, so to say, may be of little avail to the  needy, nevertheless it seems to me meet to offer it most readily where the  need is most apparent, because it will there be most serviceable and also "]]]
