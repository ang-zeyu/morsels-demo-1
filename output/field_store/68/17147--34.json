[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#3)"],[1,"   HISTORY      In 1857, a survey was made of the southern boundary of Kansas. Several  diaries (Miller, 1932; Caldwell, 1937; Bieber, 1932) were kept by  members of the surveying party, which traveled from east to west. These  accounts contain complaints of difficulty in traversing a country of  broken ridges and gulleys as the party approached the area now  comprising Chautauqua County. One account by Hugh Campbell, astronomical  computer for the party (Caldwell, 1937) mentions rocky ridges covered  with dense growth of \"black jack,\" while another by Col. Joseph Johnson,  Commander (Miller, 1932) speaks of \"a good deal of oakes in the  heights\"--indicating that the upland oak forest of the Chautauqua Hills  was in existence at that time. On reaching Big Caney River near Elgin,  Campbell wrote of a stream with very high banks and of a valley timbered  with oak and black walnut. While the party was encamped on Big Caney  River some fishing was done. Campbell (Caldwell, 1937:353) described the  fish taken as \"Cat, Trout or Bass, Buffalo and Garr.\" Eugene Bandel  (Bieber, 1932:152) wrote, \"This forenoon we did not expect to leave  camp, and therefore we went fishing. In about two hours we caught more  fish than the whole company could eat. There were some forty fish  caught, some of them weighing over ten pounds.\" It was noted that the  waters of Big Caney and its tributaries were \"very clear.\" Progressing  up Rock Creek, Johnson wrote of entering a high rolling plain covered  with fine grass, and crossed occasionally by clear wooded streams  (probably Big and Little Beaver Creeks and Grouse Creek). The diary of  Hugh Campbell (Caldwell, 1937:354) contains a description of the  Arkansas River Valley near the Oklahoma border. \"The Arkansas River at  this point is about 300 yards wide, its waters are muddy, not quite so  much so, as those of the Mississippi or Rio Bravo. Its valley is wooded  and about two miles in width, the main bottom here, being on the east  side. On the west it is a rolling prairie as far as the eye can see,  affording excellent grass.\" Some seining was done while encamped on the  Arkansas River and \"buffalo, catfish, sturgeons, and gars\" were taken  (Bieber, 1932:156).    An editorial in the Winfield Courier of November 16, 1899, vigorously  registers concern about a direct effect of settlement on fish  populations in rivers of the area:    \"The fish in the streams of Cowley County are being slaughtered by the  thousands, by the unlawful use of the seine and the deadly hoop net.  Fish are sold on the market every day, sometimes a tubful at a time,  which never swallowed a hook.    \"The fish law says it is unlawful to seine, snare, or trap fish but some  of the smaller streams in the county, it is said are so full of hoop and  trammel nets that a minnow cannot get up or down stream. These nets not  only destroy what fish there are in the streams but they keep other fish  from coming in, they are not operated as a rule by farmers to supply  their own tables but by fellows who catch the fish to sell with no  thought or care for the welfare of others who like to catch and eat  fish.    \"If there is a fishwarden in Cowley County so far as his utility goes  the county would be as well off without him and his inactivity has  caused many of those interested to get together for the purpose of  seeing that the law is enforced.    \"Depredations like this work injury in more ways than one. They not only  deplete the streams of fish large enough to eat and destroy the source  of supply but if the U. S. Fish Commission discovers that the law is not  enforced and the fish not protected, there will be no free government  fish placed in Cowley County streams. It is useless for the Government  to spend thousands of dollars to keep the streams well supplied if a few  outlaws are allowed to ruthlessly destroy them. The new organization has  its eye on certain parties now and something is liable to drop  unexpectedly soon.\"    Graham (1885:78) listed 13 species of fish that had already been  introduced into Kansas waters prior to 1885 by the State Fish  Commission.    These early references indicate that direct effects of settlement on the  native flora and fauna were recognized early. Concern such as that  expressed in the editorial above persists today; however, it is not  clear whether the fish fauna of the streams of the area has been  essentially changed by man's predation. The indirect effects through  human modifications of the environment seem to be of much importance.  Three modifications which have especially affected streams have been  agricultural use, urbanization, and industrialization.    The effect of land-use on streams is closely related to its effect on  the flora of the watershed. Turbidity, sedimentation, and the rate,  periodicity, and manner of flow all bear some relationship to the  land-use of the watershed. Stream-flow in the area has been discussed in  the section on climate.    The effects of urbanization are more tangible and better recognized than  those of agricultural land-use. Streams that flow through cities and  other populous areas undergo some modification, especially of the  streamside flora. Another effect of urbanization has been increased  loads of sewage discharged into the streams. The combined populations of  Arkansas City and Winfield rose from 3,986 in 1880 to 23,167 in 1950.  Arkansas City found it necessary to construct a sewage system in 1889;  Winfield in 1907.    There are, at the present time, nine towns within the area that have  municipal sewage systems. The State Training Home at Winfield also has a  sewage system. The Kansas State Board of Health, Division of Sanitation,  has provided information concerning adequacy of these systems and  certain others in nearby counties as of February 5, 1957. This  information is shown in Table 3.    Representatives of the Division of Sanitation, Kansas State Board of  Health, expressed the belief that pollution by both domestic sewage and  industrial wastes would be largely eliminated in the \"lower Arkansas\"  and in the Walnut watershed by 1959.    Important oil and gas resources have been discovered in each of the  three counties. The first producing wells were drilled between 1900 and  1902 (Jewett and Abernathy, 1945:24). The Arkansas River flows through  several oilfields in its course across Cowley County (Jewett and  Abernathy, 1945:97). A number of producing wells have been drilled in  the Grouse Creek watershed since 1939 and many of these wells are near  the banks of the creek. In the Big Caney watershed of Cowley and  Chautauqua counties there has been little oil production in recent  years; however, a few small pools are presently producing in  southwestern Elk County.    Clapp (1920:33) stated that \"Many of the finest streams of our state are  now destitute of fish on account of oil and salt pollution. The Walnut  River, once as  fine a bass stream as could be found anywhere, and a  beautiful stream, too, is now a murky oil run, and does not contain a  single fish so far as I know. The Fall and Verdigris rivers are  practically ruined. Both the Caney rivers are affected, and may soon be  ruined for fishing.\" Doze (1924:31) noted \"Some of the finest streams in  the state have been ruined as habitat for wild life, the Walnut River is  probably the most flagrant example.\"        TABLE 3.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL FACILITIES IN SOME SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS                COMMUNITIES.     =======================================================================          Community       |  Status on February 5, |     Remarks                          |             1957       |   -----------------------+------------------------+----------------------   Cowley County:         |                        |     Arkansas City        | Discharging raw sewage | Adequate plant in                          |                        |  design stage.

Fauna, 13:93,    October 16, 1897.    _Type locality._--Lake George, Warren County, New York.    _Range._--From southern Quebec and southern Ontario south to southern  Ohio and West Virginia; from the Atlantic Coast west into Wisconsin.  Marginal occurrences are: _Minnesota_: St. Peter (Swanson and Evans,  Jour. Mamm., 17:39, 1936); Marine (Swanson, Tech. Bull. No. 2,  Minnesota Dept.

With the more abundant material  now available, such an appraisal would be worth-while. The occurrences  cited above for Minnesota and Wisconsin were recorded in the  literature under the specific name without indication of subspecific  affinity. The reference of specimens from these states to the  subspecies _P. s. obscurus_ is an arbitrary assignment on our part; we  have not seen them. However, two specimens in the University of Kansas  Museum of Natural History from Potosi (Snake Cave) Grant County,  Wisconsin, are referable to _P. s. obscurus_. These provide the  southwesternmost record station of occurrence in Wisconsin but are  not shown on the distribution map because the specimens were received  after figure 1 was prepared.    It is noteworthy that the species _Pipistrellus subflavus_ has not  yet, as far as we can ascertain, been recorded from Michigan, northern  Indiana, northern Illinois, or Iowa. Probably the species occurs in  these areas.      +Pipistrellus subflavus veracrucis+ (Ward)      _Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, Amer. Nat., 25:745, August, 1891.      _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:93, October    16, 1897.    _Type locality._--Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., Veracruz.    _Range._--Eastern Mexico, certainly from the type locality southward  into Honduras. Records of occurrence are: _Veracruz_: Las Vigas (13  specimens from 4 km. E Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., K. U.); 30 km. SSE Jesus  Carranza, 1 (K. U.). _Honduras_: Jilamo Farm, Tela District, 3 (Univ.  Michigan).    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; measurements of 13 near  topotypes are: total length, 78(73-85); tibia, 12.9(11.8-14.7);  forearm, 31.8(29.5-33.1); greatest length of skull (exclusive of  incisors), 12.2(11.8-12.6); breadth of braincase immediately above  roots of zygomatic arches, 6.3(6.0-6.7). Color darker than Mummy Brown  above and below.    _Remarks._--The specimen from thirty kilometers south-southeast of  Jesus Carranza, Veracruz, and the three specimens from Honduras agree  in all respects with topotypes. The color of _P. s. veracrucis_ is  much darker than that of _P. s. obscurus_ and is between black and the  darkest brown in Ridgway's (_op. cit._) color key. Rinker (Jour.  Mamm., 29:179-180,1948) described the three specimens from Honduras  without assigning a specific name to them because he lacked topotypes  of _P. s. veracrucis_. We find nothing in his description to correct,  but can add that the upper tooth-rows in many, but not in all,  specimens of _P. s. veracrucis_ are straighter than in _P. s.  subflavus_. Probably it was this feature to which Rinker referred when  he said that in _veracrucis_ \"The tooth rows tend to be more  convergent posteriorly.\" Rinker did not refer the three specimens from  Honduras to _P. veracrucis_ because Ward's original description states  that _veracrucis_ has evenly spaced lower incisors and a basal cusp on  the lower canine on only its forward edge. Rinker's specimens from  Honduras have the first incisors in contact with each other, the  second incisors in contact with the first incisors and the third  incisor on each side of the lower jaw separated by a space from the  second incisor and from the canine. The specimens from Honduras have a  basal cusp on the hinder edge of the lower canine. In these two  features they agree with the specimens from Veracruz and with  specimens of _Pipistrellus subflavus_ from the United States and  Canada. It is clear that Ward (Amer. Nat., 25:747,1891) was mistaken  in stating that the lower incisors of _veracrucis_ were evenly spaced  and that the canine had a basal cusp on only the forward edge. Ward  (_loc. cit._) was correct in regarding his _Vesperugo veracrucis_ as  \"most closely related to _V. georgianus_ [= _Pipistrellus  subflavus_],\" but for want of actual specimens of _P. subflavus_ to  use in comparison was incorrect in supposing that _P. subflavus_ had  only two bands of color on the fur, more hair on the legs, and a  larger area of hair on the interfemoral membrane. In these respects we  perceive no difference between specimens from Veracruz and the United  States.    _Vesperugo veracrucis_ Ward, therefore, proves to be only a subspecies  of _Pipistrellus subflavus_, but is well characterized by dark color  and small size.    _University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, Lawrence, Kansas._    _Transmitted October 31, 1949._                                            []                                 23-1546             *       *        *        *        *      Transcriber's Notes      The text presented in this file is that contained in the original    printed version.
