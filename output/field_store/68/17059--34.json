And since he didn't reply,  and she had learned to be mortally afraid of weasels, she ran off  squawking, to hide high up in the haymow in the barn.    Johnnie Green hadn't carried away much more of the woodpile when old dog  Spot began to dig furiously in the dirt. And in a few seconds' time he  unearthed a big bone.    It was a choice bone. He had buried it several days before. And when he  came back from the woods and found a woodpile on top of the place where  he had hidden it, it was no wonder that he made such a howdy-do.    Johnnie Green looked much upset as he stood stock still and saw Spot  trot away with the bone in his mouth.    \"So _that_ was what he was after all the time!\" he cried at last. \"I  hoped it was a muskrat.\"    His father and the hired man laughed and laughed.    \"I don't see any joke,\" Johnnie grumbled. \"Here I've piled up wood  enough in the shed to last a month. And I might have been fishing all  the time.\"    \"Well,\" said his father, \"whose fault is it?\"    \"Old Spot's, I should think!\" Johnnie replied.    \"I don't see how you can blame him,\" said Farmer Green. \"Suppose you had  buried a piece of strawberry shortcake here, expecting to eat it for  your dinner. And suppose there wasn't another piece as good--or as  big--to be had anywhere. And suppose you had come back from a tramp in  the woods, hungry as--well, hungry as you were this noon. Wouldn't you  want that piece of shortcake? If you could get old Spot to move the wood  off it, wouldn't you be glad to have him do it?\"    \"Maybe!\" Johnnie admitted. \"Maybe! But Spot wasn't after a piece of  strawberry shortcake. He was after an old bone. And he fooled me.\"    \"I should say that you fooled yourself,\" his father retorted. \"Anyhow,  we're going to have strawberry shortcake for supper to-night. I heard  your mother say so. And she made a special cake for you.\"    That news made Johnnie Green look a good deal less gloomy. In fact he  almost smiled.    \"I _was_ going to give you that old fishing rod of mine if you'd help  carry in the wood,\" Farmer Greene went on. \"And you _could_ take it now  and go fishing, if you thought you could be home in time for supper.\"    \"Hurrah!\" Johnnie Green suddenly jumped up and down. \"Hurrah!\" he cried.  \"And thank you very much!\"    And when, an hour later, old Spot came swimming across the creek and  joined Johnnie on the further bank, and shook drops of water all over  his young master, Johnnie Green only patted him and called him a \"good  old fellow.\"          VII    SWIMMING      Old dog Spot liked boys. Somehow they always managed to have a lively  time; and usually they seemed glad to have him join them in their  sports.    He never could understand why Johnnie Green and the neighbors' boys  didn't want him to play baseball with them. Spot loved to chase a ball.  And sometimes when he was watching a game and somebody hit a slow  grounder he would rush out and grab the ball and run with it.    Then all the boys would run after him and try to catch him. That always  pleased Spot mightily. And the longer the chase lasted the happier he  was. But it was different with the boys. The harder they had to run  after Spot before they got the ball away from him the more out of  patience they became.    Whenever Spot took part in a ball game like that Johnnie Green usually  put an end to his fun, for the time being, by tying him to something or  other--perhaps a fence or a tree. But even that was better--so Spot  thought--than being sent home in disgrace.    Luckily there were other sports in which Spot could romp with the boys  as much as he pleased, without anybody's objecting. Nutting in the woods  in the fall; skating on the mill pond or coasting down the long hill  past Farmer Green's house in the winter; berrying in the summer--and  swimming! Those were only a few of the jolly times that Spot and the  boys enjoyed together.    Perhaps, of them all, both Spot and the boys liked swimming the most. As  for Spot, he didn't care _where_ he swam, so long as the water was wet.  Broad Brook, Swift River, Black Creek, or the mill pond--any one of  those places suited him as well as another. The boys, however, preferred  the mill pond. It was deep enough, by the dam, to suit the best  swimmers; and it was shallow enough at the upper end for those that were  just learning.    All the boys thought it great fun when a wagon clattered over the  bridge, which crossed right above the dam. Then they ducked into the  water, with only their heads out, and shouted more or less politely at  whoever was passing.    At such times Spot barked, because that seemed to him the gentlemanly  thing to do. But he never could see any sense in jumping into the water  if he happened to be out on the bank when a wagon came along.    The boys threw sticks about the pond for Spot to fetch back to them.  They raced with him. They upset him when he was sunning himself on the  big rock near the dam, and they laughed to see the splash he made when  he struck the water.    No matter what tricks the boys played on him, Spot never lost his  temper. He took everything good-naturedly. And one day, when Johnnie  Green and his friends were swimming in the mill pond he even took a  bundle of clothes from beneath a big hickory on the bank. Yes! Spot  caught up somebody's clothes in his mouth and started along the road  with them.    He was surprised to hear a terrible outcry from the water.          VIII    WHAT RED DID      Old dog Spot was trotting down the road from the mill pond, carrying a  bundle of somebody's clothes in his mouth. When he heard frantic shouts  from the water, where Johnnie Green and his friends were swimming, he  quickened his pace.    One of the swimmers was known as \"Red.\" And it was a favorite trick of  his to tie hard knots in other boys' garments while the owners of them  were in the pond. Usually he wet the knots, because wetting them made  them harder to untie.    On this day somebody had turned the tables on Red. Somebody had crept  up behind the big old hickory tree on the bank and had knotted Red's  clothes tightly. That was why old Spot found a bundle under the tree,  all tied up and ready to carry off.    It was no wonder that the boys began to yell when they saw Spot pick up  those clothes and calmly trot away with them. It was no wonder that they  swam to the bank and scrambled up to the big hickory to find out whose  clothes were missing.    When they saw that Red was the unlucky one, everybody else began to  whoop and laugh.    But not Red! He let out a frightened scream and started to follow old  dog Spot.    To the great delight of his companions, the rattle of a wagon and the  thud of a horse's feet sounded from up the road. And since some one must  soon drive over the bridge, which crossed right above the dam, Red  scurried back again and dived into the pond, into which Johnnie Green  and the others had already plunged.    Red rose to the surface spluttering. And finding that he could touch  bottom with his feet, he stood with his carroty head out of water,  watching for the wagon.    It soon came into view, out of the woods, and the horse that drew it  thundered upon the bridge. The horse was old Ebenezer; and Farmer Green  was driving him.    \"Hi!\" Red shouted. \"Stop! Wait a minute!\"    Johnnie Green's father pulled Ebenezer to a halt.    \"What's going on here?\" he inquired.    \"Spot took my clothes,\" Red explained. \"He's run down the road with  them. Get them for me--please!\"    Hoots and catcalls from the other boys followed Red's speech, which was  a wonderfully polite one--for him.    Farmer Green couldn't help laughing.    \"I'm going to the village,\" he said. \"If I find any clothes along the  road I'll pick them up and put them in the wagon. And if you're here  when I come back I'll give them to you.\"    \"He'll be here!\" Johnnie Green shouted. \"Red'll wait for you.\"    \"If you hurry, maybe you can catch Spot,\" Red called to Farmer Green as  he drove off. \"I can't stay here all day.\"    \"You'll have to,\" the boys jeered.    \"Maybe you'll have to wait here till dark,\" Johnnie Green suggested.    \"I won't!\" Red replied, as he swam towards the bank. \"Your dog took my  clothes,\" he cried as he ran up to the big hickory. \"And I'm going to  take yours.\"    [Illustration: Spot Started After Frisky Squirrel.    (_Page 42_)]    It was Johnnie's turn to yell then. He was on the further side of the  mill pond. And long before he could cross it Red had snatched up  Johnnie's clothes from the shade of the hickory and dodged into the  bushes with them.          IX    A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES      Old dog Spot was trotting down the road with the bundle of clothes in  his mouth--the clothes which belonged to Johnnie Green's friend Red, who  was one of the swimming party in the mill pond.    Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys had not come tearing down the road  after him.    \"It's queer,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder why they don't follow me.  This would be fun if they'd only chase me.\"    Just then he happened to spy a squirrel on a stone wall. Spot promptly  made for this gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on his bundle, he plunged  through a tangle of blackberry bushes that grew beside the road.    The thorny brambles caught at Spot's bundle and held it fast.    \"_G-r-r-r!_\" he growled. \"I don't want to lose sight of that fat fellow.  Unless I'm mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel. And I've had an eye out for  him for a longtime.\"    After a few frantic tugs he let go of the bundle of clothes and dashed  after the squirrel.    It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a tree while Spot was struggling in  the blackberry thicket. And he scampered from one tree top to another  while Spot followed beneath him, barking furiously.    At last Frisky stopped and sat on a limb, to chatter and scold at old  dog Spot.    \"What are you doing so far from home?\" he demanded after a while.    \"I've been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30677"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#3)"],[1,"parts of the interior of  the United States, the Belted Piping Plover is a common summer resident,  and is found along the shores of the great lakes, breeding on the flat,  pebbly beach between the sand dunes and shore. It is the second of the  ring-necked Plovers, and arrives in April in scattering flocks, which  separate into pairs a month later. It strays at times into the interior,  and has been known to breed on the borders of ponds many miles from the  coast. In New England, however, it seldom wanders far from the shore,  and prefers sand islands near the main land for its nesting haunts.  Nelson says, that some thirty pairs, which were breeding along the beach  at Waukegan, within a space of two miles, successfully concealed their  nests, for which he made diligent search, although the birds were  continually circling about or standing at a short distance, uttering an  occasional note of alarm.    These birds have a soft, low, piping note, which they utter not only  upon the wing, but occasionally as they run about upon the ground, and,  during the early nesting season, a peculiar, loud, prolonged, musical  call, that readily attracts attention. In other respects, their habits  are not noticeably differed from the Semi-palmated. (See July BIRDS, p.8.)    Their nests are without lining, a mere depression in the sand. The eggs  are usually four, light gray to creamy buff, finely and rather sparsely  speckled or dotted with blackish brown and purplish gray.    The female Belted Piping Plover is similar to the male, but with the  dark colors lighter and less in extent. The young have no black band in  front, while the collar around the neck is ashy brown.    These interesting and valuable game birds are found associated with  various beach birds and Sandpipers, and they become exceedingly fat  during the latter part of the summer.    All the Plovers have a singular habit when alighting on the ground in  the nesting time; they drop their wings, stand with their legs half  bent, and tremble as if unable to support their bodies. In this absurd  position they will stand, according to a well-known observer, for  several minutes, uttering a curious sound, and then seem to balance  themselves with great difficulty. This singular manoeuvre is no doubt  intended to produce a belief that they may be easily caught, and thus  turn the attention of the egg-gatherer from the pursuit of the eggs to  themselves, their eggs being recognized the world over, as a great  delicacy.          The Plover utters a piping sound      While on the wing or on the ground;      All a tremble it drops its wings,      And, with legs half bent, it sings:      \"My nest is near, come take the eggs,      And take me too,--I'm off my legs.\"      In vain men search with eager eyes,      No nest is found, the Plover flies!                                     --C.

Co., 1897, Chicago.]          THE WILD TURKEY.      It has been observed that when the Turkey makes its appearance on table  all conversation should for the moment be suspended. That it is eaten in  silence on some occasions may be inferred from the following anecdote:  A certain judge of Avignon, famous for his love of the glorious bird,  which the American people have wisely selected for the celebration of  Thanksgiving Day, said to a friend: \"We have just been dining on a  superb Turkey. It was excellent. Stuffed with truffles to the very  throat--tender, delicate, filled with perfume! We left nothing but the  bones!\" \"How many were there of you?\" asked his friend. \"Two,\" replied  the judge, \"the Turkey--and myself!\" The reason, no doubt, why this  brilliant bird, which so much resembles the domestic Turkey, is now  almost extinct. It was formerly a resident of New England, and is still  found to some extent as far north-west as the Missouri River and  south-west as Texas. In Ohio it was formerly an abundant resident. Dr.  Kirtland (1850) mentions the time when Wild Turkeys were more common  than tame ones are now.    The nests of this bird are very difficult to discover, as they are made  on the ground, midst tall, thick weeds or tangled briars. The female  will not leave the nest until almost trodden upon. It is stated that  when the eggs are once touched, she will abandon her nest.    The Turkey became known to Europeans almost immediately upon the  discovery of America by the Spaniards in 1518, and it is probable that  it is distinctively an American bird. In its wild state, its plumage, as  in the case of the Honduras Turkey, grows more lustrous and magnificent  as the family extends southward.    The \"Gobblers,\" as the males are called, associate in parties of ten to  one hundred, seeking their food apart from the females, which wander  singly with their young or in troops with other hens and their families,  sometimes to the number of seventy or eighty. They travel on foot,  unless disturbed by the hunter or a river compels them to take wing. It  is said that when about to cross a river, they select a high eminence  from which to start, that their flight may be more sure, and in such a  position they sometimes remain for a day or more, as if in consultation.  On such occasions the males gobble vociferously, strutting about  pompously as if to animate their companions. At the signal note of  their leader, they wing their way to the opposite shore.    The Wild Turkey feeds on many kinds of berries, fruits, and grasses.  Beetles, tadpoles, young frogs, and lizards are sometimes found in its  crop. When the Turkeys reach their destination, they disperse in flocks,  devouring the mast as they proceed.    Pairing time begins in March. The sexes roost apart, but at no great  distance, so that when the female utters a call, every male within  hearing responds, rolling note after note in rapid succession, in a  voice resembling that of the tame Turkey when he hears any unusual  noise. Where the Turkeys are numerous, the woods from one end to the  other, sometimes for many miles, resound with these voices of wooing.    The specimen of the Wild Turkey presented in this number of BIRDS is of  extraordinary size and beauty, and has been much admired. The day is not  far distant when a living specimen of this noble bird will be sought for  in vain in the United States.          THE CERULEAN WARBLER.      This beautiful little sky-blue feathered creature is well named Azure  Warbler, or again White-throated Blue Warbler, and is the most abundant  of the genus here.    It is a bird of the wood, everywhere associated with the beautiful tall  forests of the more northern counties of western New York, sometimes  found in the open woods of pasture-lands, and quite partial to hardwood  trees. In its flitting motion in search of insect-prey, and in the  jerking curves of its more prolonged flight, as also in its structure,  it is a genuine Wood Warbler and keeps for the most part to what Thoreau  calls the \"upper story\" of its sylvan domain.    All Warblers, it has been said, depend upon their markings rather than  song for their identity, which renders the majority of the tribe of  greater interest to the scientist than to the novice. Until you have  named four or five of the commonest species as landmarks, you will be  considerably confused.    Audubon described the song of the Cerulean Warbler as \"extremely sweet  and mellow,\" whereas it is a modest little strain, says Chapman, or  trill, divided into syllables like _zee, zee, zee, ze-ee-ee-eep_, or  according to another observer, _rheet, rheet, rheet, rheet, ridi, idi,  e-e-e-e-ee_; beginning with several soft warbling notes and ending in a  rather prolonged but quite musical squeak. The latter and more rapid  part of the strain, which is given in the upward slide, approaches an  insect quality of tone which is more or less peculiar to all true  Warblers, a song so common as to be a universal characteristic of our  tall forests.    It is not strange that the nest of this species has been so seldom  discovered, even where the bird is very abundant during the breeding  season. It is built in the higher horizontal branches of forest trees,  always out some distance from the trunk, and ranging from twenty to  fifty feet above the ground. One described by Dr. Brewer, found in  Ontario, near Niagara Falls, was built in a large oak tree at the height  of fifty or more feet from the ground. It was placed horizontally on the  upper surface of a slender limb between two small twigs; and the branch  on which it was thus saddled was only an inch and a half in thickness,  being nine feet from the trunk of the tree. The abandoned home was  secured with great difficulty.    The nest is a rather slender fabric, somewhat similar to the nest of the  Redstart, and quite small for the bird, consisting chiefly of a strong  rim firmly woven of strips of fine bark, stems of grasses, and pine  needles, bound round with flaxen fibres of plants and wool. Around the  base a few bits of hornets' nests, mosses, and lichens are loosely  fastened. The nest within is furnished with fine stems and needles, the  flooring very thin and slight.    The bird is shy when started from the nest, and has a sharp chipping  alarm-note common to the family.    The Cerulean Warbler is found in the Eastern States, but is more  numerous west of the Allegheny mountains, and throughout the heavily  wooded districts of the Mississippi valley. In winter it migrates to  Central America and Cuba. The Warblers are of unfailing interest to the  lover of bird life. Apart from the beauty of the birds themselves, with  their perpetually contrasting colors among the green leaves, their  pretty ways furnish to the silent watcher an ever changing spectacle of  the innocent life in the tree-tops.
