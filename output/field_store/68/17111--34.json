The cost of maintaining  them will not be great and they will not only provide a most acceptable  variety in the form of duck meat and duck eggs for the farmers' table  but they will also produce a surplus which can be sold at a profit. It  must be remembered, however, that where only a small flock is kept it is  generally impracticable for the farmer to give his ducks the attention  necessary to cater to the market for green ducklings. As a result he  usually keeps them until fall and sells them on the market at a  considerably lower price than is obtained by the commercial duck grower.    There also exists an opportunity which has not been developed to any  great extent to keep some one of the egg producing breeds of ducks such  as the Indian Runner for the primary purpose of egg production. A few  ventures of this sort seem to have been successful but it must be  remembered that the market for duck eggs is not nearly so broad as that  for hens' eggs and that in some quarters there exists considerable  prejudice against duck eggs for table consumption. Before engaging in  duck raising primarily for the production of market eggs it would  therefore be necessary to investigate and consider carefully the market  conditions in the neighborhood so as to know whether the eggs could be  marketed to advantage. While the Runner ducks are prolific layers there  is no advantage in keeping them in preference to fowls as egg producers.  The eggs are larger in size but it takes more feed to produce them,  while they cannot as a rule be disposed of at much if any higher price  than can be secured for hens' eggs. For baking purposes duck eggs can be  readily sold on account of their larger size.    There is always an opportunity to produce fine stock of any kind,  whether it be ducks, chickens, turkeys or geese. Ducks are not exhibited  to the same extent as are chickens and the competition in the shows is  not as a rule so keen. Nevertheless many persons are interested in  producing and exhibiting good stock and there exists a very definite  market for birds of quality.    There is also a probability that a good business could be worked up by  one who would pay special attention to producing a strain of ducks of  early maturity, large size and good vigor in order to supply breeding  drakes to many of the commercial duck farms. These farms usually secure  drakes for breeding from sources outside their own flocks each year but  the usual practice is to exchange drakes with some other commercial  grower. While very good birds are to be found on these duck farms there  is no greater opportunity to engage in any systematic breeding, the  selection of the breeding stock being of rather a hurried nature during  certain seasons of the year when the ducks are being marketed. Moreover,  the long continued custom of exchanging drakes with the neighboring  farmers has in most cases led to the blood being so largely confined  within one circle that no great percentage of new blood is obtained by  these exchanges. Of course, the opportunity along breeding lines for  this purpose is limited to the Pekin duck as this is the breed which is  kept upon all the large commercial duck farms in the United States.    _Prices for Breeding Stock._ Duck breeders who make a specialty of  selling breeding stock or eggs for hatching find a steady and quite a  wide demand for their stock. The eggs are usually sold in sittings of 11  and bring a price of from $3 to $5 per sitting depending on the quality  of the stock. The prices received for the birds themselves depend of  course upon their quality and may run anywhere from about $5 to $25 per  bird.    _Ducks for Ornamental Purposes._ On estates or in parks where natural or  artificial ponds are included in the grounds, waterfowl are often kept  for ornamental purposes. Any breeds may be used, and often the gay  colored Wood Duck and Mandarin, or some one of the small breeds such as  the Calls, Black East Indian or the Mallards are kept for this purpose.  It is said that these small ducks will absolutely destroy the mosquito  larvae in any such ponds or lakes.          CHAPTER II    Breeds and Varieties--How to Mate to Produce Exhibition  Specimens--Preparing Ducks for the Show--Catching and Handling      _Breeds of Ducks._ There are 11 standard breeds of ducks. All of these  breeds with the exception of the Call, Muscovy and Runner consist of a  single variety. The Call is divided into two varieties, the Gray and the  White; the Muscovy consists of two varieties, the Colored and the White;  and the Runner consists of three varieties, the Fawn and White, the  White and the Penciled.    Duck breeders, of course, whether raising the birds for fancy or for  profit, keep one of the standard breads or varieties. Frequently, also,  the farm flocks consist of standardbred ducks but on many farms,  probably a great majority, the flock consists of the common or so-called  \"puddle\" duck. In certain parts of the South there is a duck known as  the \"mule duck\" which is a cross between the Muscovy and the common  duck. This is a duck of good market quality but will not breed from  which characteristic it gets its name. Most of the common or \"puddle\"  ducks which are found on farms are of rather small size, are indifferent  as layers, and do not make a desirable type of market duck. They have  arisen simply from the crossing of standard breeds with resultant  carelessness and indifference in breeding. Because of the care with  which they have been selected and bred for definite purposes, the  standard breeds are decidedly superior to the common \"puddle\" ducks and  should by all means be kept in preference since they will yield better  results and greater profits.    In addition to the standard breeds and varieties flocks of Mallards are  also kept to a limited extent. The Mallard is a common small wild duck  which has lent itself readily to domestication and which thrives with  proper care under confined conditions. In weight, the drakes will run  from 2-1/2 pounds to 3 pounds or even a little larger. The ducks average  about 21/4 pounds with a variation of from 1 pound 12 ounces to 2 pounds 8  ounces. By selecting the large eggs for hatching and by liberal feeding,  it is easy to increase the size of Mallards to such an extent that they  resemble small Rouens rather than wild Mallards. The plumage of the  Mallard is very similar to that of the Rouen but of a lighter shade.  Another small wild duck known as the Wood or Carolina duck, which is a  native of North America, has been domesticated and on account of the  great beauty of its plumage is usually to be found wherever ornamental  waterfowl are kept. The Mandarin duck is a small duck of about the same  size as the Wood duck, is of beautiful plumage and like the Wood duck  is generally kept for ornamental purposes. This duck is said to be a  native of China.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Upper--Pair of Mule Ducks. Lower--Pair of Blue  Swedish Ducks. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.

The  Mallard is a wild duck which is quite easily domesticated and which has  a plumage color very similar to the Rouen. It is small in size.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    Classification of Breeds    So far as the standard breeds and varieties are concerned they may be  divided into three classes according to the purpose for which they are  kept and for which they are best suited. First is the meat class which  consists of the Pekin, Aylesbury, Muscovy, Rouen, Buff, Cayuga and Blue  Swedish. These breeds could well be termed general purpose ducks for  they are quite good layers in addition to producing excellent table  carcasses and are therefore well suited for general farm use. They are,  however, kept more particularly for meat production.    The second class is known as the egg class and consists of the three  varieties of the Runner Duck, formerly known as the Indian Runner. The  Runner Duck is much smaller in size than the birds of the meat class, is  longer in leg and more active, and is not so well suited for the  production of table ducks but is a very prolific layer. With proper  feeding and management the Runner ducks will compare favorably with hens  as egg producers.    The third class is known as the ornamental class and is composed of the  ducks which are kept and bred principally for ornamental purposes. This  class consists of the Call duck with its two varieties, the Black East  India duck and the Crested White duck. Both the Call and East India  ducks are small in size being really the bantams of the duck family.  While they make good table birds, their small size handicaps them as  commercial meat fowl. The Crested White duck is of larger size,  possesses a crest and is bred mainly as an ornamental fowl.    _Marking the Ducks._ The duck raiser who is breeding his ducks for  exhibition quality has need for knowledge of the breeding of the birds  he may contemplate using in his matings. In order that this information  may be available, the young ducks as they are hatched can be marked by  toe punching them on the webs of their feet in the same manner that baby  chicks are toe punched. A different set or combination of marks is used  for each mating so that the breeding of the different ducks can be  distinguished. Mature ducks can, if desired, be leg banded in order to  furnish a distinguishing mark.

Kalabakan is  situated on the Kalabakan River at the upper tidal limit. The  Nipa-Mangrove association, not investigated, lies immediately below  Kalabakan.    The Brantian Estate area was mostly in secondary forest and was situated  on the Brantian River. There were some fairly large areas of grass with  water buffalo wallows in them. These grassy areas were favorite haunts  of the Painted Quail, _Coturnix chinensis_.    TENOM.--The first locality that we investigated was 5.5 miles southwest  of Tenom, approximately 4,000 feet elevation, in moss forest. A few days  were spent collecting in the area of Tenom itself.    _Moss forest._--The lower altitudinal limit of the moss forest was about  3,600 feet. The trees on top of the mountain were mostly oaks  (_Quercus_) and were festooned with ferns, orchids, and other epiphytes.  The area had been used as a triangulation station by a survey team and a  small area on top of the mountain had been cleared earlier. At the time  of our visit this small area had grown to secondary vegetation, mostly  _Pandanus_. The oaks in the primary forest surrounding this disturbed  area were generally about 30 to 50 feet high and there was little  undergrowth in virgin stands. This area was usually swathed in fog from  three o'clock in the afternoon until eleven o'clock the next morning.  One morning of our fourteen there was clear.    _Paddy._--The area visited at Tenom itself consisted mostly of old paddy  grown to grass and scrub. Forest did occur but was of secondary nature  in the immediate vicinity of Tenom.    SIAMIL ISLAND.--This island is about one mile in circumference and the  highest point is about 300 feet above sea level. The island has high  bluffs on three sides but slopes gently to the sea on the other. There  were patches of forest left on the island, one on the north side and one  on the south. The sheer bluffs on the east side of the island were  covered with _Pandanus_ sp. The undergrowth of the north forest had been  cut, leaving extensive bare areas. The principal undergrowth was rattan.  The natives are clearing and planting more of the island to coconuts and  hope eventually to clear it completely.    KARINDINGEN ISLAND.--This island, about half a mile in circumference and  between 10 and 20 feet above sea level at its highest point, was  surrounded by extensive coral reefs and sand; the principal vegetation  was mangroves.          ECOLOGICAL AFFINITIES OF THE AVIFAUNA AT QUOIN HILL      More time was spent at Quoin Hill than at any other locality. Fifty five  of the more common and hence best-known birds are listed in Table 1  together with their primary and secondary preferences of habitat. The  habitat distribution of the birds shows the amount of secondary  utilization of habitats by birds that occurred predominantly in one  habitat. Cocoa was utilized by 6.2 per cent of the birds of the primary  forest, and 88.8 per cent of birds of the secondary forest. This  indicates that cocoa is an effective substitute for secondary forest for  some birds. Of the species of the primary forest, 18.7 per cent occurred  also in secondary forest; thus, three times as many species of primary  forest utilized secondary forest as utilized cocoa. This too might be  expected, since \"secondary\" forest is of frequent natural occurrence and  an ancient feature while the comparatively simple cocoa plantings are  new and artificial.

Smythies (1957:527) defines four altitudinal areas of  distribution: Higher Montane, Montane, Submontane, and Lowland. Higher  Montane birds have not been recorded on mountains the summits of which  are lower than 5,000 feet, although on higher peaks the actual lower  limit of occurrence may be considerably below 5,000 feet. Montane birds  have not been recorded on mountains the summits of which are lower than  3,000 feet, although specimens may have been taken below that altitude  on higher peaks. Submontane, as defined by Smythies, is a comprehensive  term applied to birds occurring from sea level to an elevation of 5,000  feet but ordinarily not found away from mountainous country. The Lowland  birds normally range from sea level to 3,000 feet. Of the 125 species of  birds observed at Quoin Hill, 1.6 per cent were Montane, 14.4 per cent  were Submontane and 84 per cent were Lowland species. The distribution  of birds 12 miles north of Kalabakan closely resembled that at Quoin  Hill except for the total absence of Montane species and an increase of  Submontane species to 25 per cent. The observation of fewer species (48)  can be attributed to the nearly uniform habitat.    The avifauna in the moss forest 5.5 miles southwest of Tenom was unusual  in that 45.4 per cent consisted of Lowland species; this locality lies  4,000 feet above sea level, yet only 27.3 per cent of its species were  Submontane and 27.3 per cent Montane. If one looks at these figures from  the standpoint of the actual importance of the three groups at this  place, however, a different picture emerges. Some of the Lowland species  were seen only once while I was there and few were common, while all of  the Submontane and most of the Montane forms were more or less common.          SEASONALITY OF BREEDING      _The breeding season in North Borneo._--Birds in the Quoin Hill area of  eastern Borneo seem to breed most commonly in June, July, and August.  Table 2 lists 34 of the more common species at Quoin Hill for which  evidence on breeding was available. The actual evidence was provided by  females with active brood patches or active ovaries, males with enlarged  testes, birds in juvenal plumage, or birds actively in annual molt. From  such data dates of presumed breeding were extrapolated. In Table 2, the  solid black lines indicate dates for which both male and female were in  breeding condition. The dotted lines indicate enlarged testes but no  evidence of breeding in females. In the bottom line of Table 2, the  figures indicate the percentage of the population breeding in any one  month. For instance, 2.9 per cent of the birds were breeding in March,  but 73 per "]]]
