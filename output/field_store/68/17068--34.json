While these researches had engaged my attention, appeared Gifford's  Memoirs of Ben Jonson. The characteristics of Masques are there, for the  first time, elaborately opened with the clear and penetrating spirit of  that ablest of our dramatic critics. I feel it like presumption to add  to what has received the finishing hand of a master; but his jewel is  locked up in a chest, which I fear is too rarely opened, and he will  allow me to borrow something from its splendour. \"The Masque, as it  attained its highest degree of excellence, admitted of dialogue,  singing, and dancing; these were not independent of one another, but  combined, by the introduction of some ingenious fable, into an  harmonious whole. When the plan was formed, the aid of the sister-arts  was called in; for the essence of the Masque was pomp and glory.  Moveable scenery of the most costly and splendid kind was lavished on  the Masque; the most celebrated masters were employed on the songs and  dances; and all that the kingdom afforded of vocal and instrumental  excellence was employed to embellish the exhibition.[8] Thus  magnificently constructed, the Masque was not committed to ordinary  performers. It was composed, as Lord Bacon says, for princes, and by  princes it was played.[9] Of these Masques, the skill with which their  ornaments were designed, and the inexpressible grace with which they  were executed, appear to have left a vivid impression on the mind of  Jonson. His genius awakes at once, and all his faculties attune to  sprightliness and pleasure. He makes his appearance, like his own  Delight, 'accompanied with Grace, Love, Harmony, Revel, Sport, and  Laughter.'      \"In curious knot and mazes so    The Spring at first was taught to go;    And Zephyr, when he came to woo    His Flora, had his _motions_[10] too;    And thus did Venus learn to lead    The Idalian brawls, and so to tread,    As if the wind, not she, did walk,    Nor press'd a flower, nor bow'd a stalk.    \"But in what,\" says Gifford, \"was the taste of the times _wretched_? In  poetry, painting, architecture, they have not since been equalled; and  it ill becomes us to arraign the taste of a period which possessed a  cluster of writers of whom the meanest would now be esteemed a prodigy.\"  Malone did not live to read this denouncement of his objection to these  Masques, as \"bungling shows;\" and which Warburton treats as \"fooleries;\"  Granger as \"wretched performances;\" while Mr. Todd regards them merely  as \"the humour of the times!\"    Masques were often the private theatricals of the families of our  nobility, performed by the ladies and gentlemen at their seats; and were  splendidly got up on certain occasions: such as the celebration of a  nuptial, or in compliment to some great visitor. The Masque of Comus was  composed by Milton to celebrate the creation of Charles the First as  Prince of Wales; a scene in this Masque presented both the castle and  the town of Ludlow, which proves, that although our small public  theatres had not yet displayed any of the scenical illusions which long  afterwards Davenant introduced, these scenical effects existed in great  perfection in the Masques. The minute descriptions introduced by Thomas  Campion, in his \"Memorable Masque,\" as it is called, will convince us  that the scenery must have been exquisite and fanciful, and that the  poet was always a watchful and anxious partner with the machinist, with  whom sometimes, however, he had a quarrel.    The subject of this very rare Masque was \"The Night and the Hours.\" It  would be tedious to describe the first scene with the fondness with  which the poet has dwelt on it. It was a double valley; one side, with  dark clouds hanging before it; on the other, a green vale, with trees,  and nine golden ones of fifteen feet high; from which grove, towards  \"the State,\" or the seat of the king, was a broad descent to the  dancing-place: the bower of Flora was on the right, the house of Night  on the left; between them a hill, hanging like a cliff over the grove.  The bower of Flora was spacious, garnished with flowers and flowery  branches, with lights among them; the house of Night ample and stately,  with black columns studded with golden stars; within, nothing but clouds  and twinkling stars; while about it were placed, on wire, artificial  bats and owls, continually moving. As soon as the king entered the great  hall, the hautboys, out of the wood on the top of the hill, entertained  the time, till Flora and Zephyr were seen busily gathering flowers from  the bower, throwing them into baskets which two silvans held, attired in  changeable taffeta. The song is light as their fingers, but the burden  is charming:--      Now hath Flora robb'd her bowers    To befriend this place with flowers;      Strow about! strow about!    Divers, divers flowers affect    For some private dear respect;      Strow about! strow about!    But he's none of Flora's friend    That will not the rose commend;      Strow about! strow about!    I cannot quit this Masque, of which, collectors know the rarity, without  preserving one of those Doric delicacies, of which, perhaps, we have  outlived the taste! It is a playful dialogue between a Silvan and an  Hour, while Night appears in her house, with her long black hair  spangled with gold, amidst her Hours; their faces black, and each  bearing a lighted black torch.      SILVAN. Tell me, gentle Hour of Night,                     Wherein dost thou most delight?      HOUR.   Not in sleep!      SILVAN.                Wherein then?      HOUR.    In the frolic view of men!      SILVAN.  Lov'st thou music?      HOUR.                    Oh! 'tis sweet!      SILVAN.  What's dancing?      HOUR.                   E'en the mirth of feet.      SILVAN.  Joy you in fairies and in elves?      HOUR.    We are of that sort ourselves!             But, Silvan! say, why do you love             Only to frequent the grove?      SILVAN.  Life is fullest of content             When delight is innocent.      HOUR.    Pleasure must vary, not be long!             Come then, let's close, and end the song!    That the moveable scenery of these Masques formed as perfect a scenical  illusion as any that our own age, with all its perfection of decoration,  has attained to, will not be denied by those who have read the few  Masques which have been printed. They usually contrived a double  division of the scene; one part was for some time concealed from the  spectator, which produced surprise and variety. Thus in the Lord's  Masque, at the marriage of the Palatine, the scene was divided into two  parts, from the roof to the floor; the lower part being first  discovered, there appeared a wood in perspective, the innermost part  being of \"releeve or whole round,\" the rest painted. On the left a cave,  and on the right a thicket, from which issued Orpheus. At the back part  of the scene, at the sudden fall of a curtain, the upper part broke on  the spectators, a heaven of clouds of all hues; the stars suddenly  vanished, the clouds dispersed; an element of artificial fire played  about the house of Prometheus--a bright and transparent cloud, reaching  from the heavens to the earth, whence the eight masquers descending with  the music of a full song; and at the end of their descent the cloud  broke in twain, and one part of it, as with a wind, was blown athwart  the scene. While this cloud was vanishing, the wood, being the under  part of the scene, was insensibly changing; a perspective view opened,  with porticoes on each side, and female statues of silver, accompanied  with ornaments of architecture, filling the end of the house of  Prometheus, and seemed all of goldsmiths' work. The women of Prometheus  descended from their niches, till the anger of Jupiter turned them again  into statues. It is evident, too, that the size of the proscenium, or  stage, accorded with the magnificence of the scene; for I find choruses  described, \"and changeable conveyances of the song,\" in manner of an  echo, performed by more than forty different voices and instruments in  various parts of the scene. The architectural decorations were the pride  of Inigo Jones; such could not be trivial.    \"I suppose,\" says the writer of this Masque, \"few have ever seen more  neat artifice than Master Inigo Jones showed in contriving their motion;  who, as all the rest of the workmanship which belonged to the whole  invention, showed extraordinary industry and skill, which if it be not  as lively expressed in writing as it appeared in view, rob not him of  his due, but lay the blame on my want of right apprehending his  instructions, for the _adoring_ of his art.\" Whether this strong  expression should be only _adorning_ does not appear in any errata; but  the feeling of admiration was fervent among the spectators of that day,  who were at least as much astonished as they were delighted. Ben  Jonson's prose descriptions of scenes in his own exquisite Masques, as  Gifford observes, \"are singularly bold and beautiful.\" In a letter which  I discovered, the writer of which had been present at one of these  Masques, and which Gifford has preserved,[11] the reader may see the  great poet anxiously united with Inigo Jones in working the machinery.  Jonson, before \"a sacrifice could be performed, turned the globe of the  earth, standing behind the altar.\" In this globe \"the sea was expressed  heightened with silver waves, which stood, or rather hung (for no axle  was seen to support it), and _turning softly_, discovered the first  Masque,\"[12] &c. This \"turning softly\" producing a very magical effect,  the great poet would trust to no other hand but his own!    It seems, however, that as no Masque-writer equalled Jonson, so no  machinist rivalled Inigo Jones. I have sometimes caught a groan from  some unfortunate poet, whose beautiful fancies were spoilt by the  bungling machinist. One says, \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#3)"],[1," he sat and held his magnifying glass before his eye, and  looked at a drop of water that was taken out of a little pool in the  ditch. What a creeping and crawling was there! all the thousands of  small creatures hopped and jumped about, pulled one another, and  pecked one another.    \"But this is abominable!\" said Creep-and-Crawl, \"Can one not get them  to live in peace and quiet, and each mind his own business?\" And he  thought and thought, but he could come to no conclusion, and so he was  obliged to conjure. \"I must give them a color, that they may be more  discernible!\" said he; and so he poured something like a little drop  of red wine into the drop of water, but it was bewitched blood from  the lobe of the ear--the very finest sort for a penny; and then all  the strange creatures became rose-colored over the whole body. It  looked like a whole town of naked savages.    \"What have you got there?\" said another old wizard, who had no name,  and that was just the best of it.    \"Why,\" said Creep-and-Crawl, \"if you can guess what it is, I will make  you a present of it; but it is not so easy to find out when one does  not know it!\"    The wizard who had no name looked through the magnifying glass. It  actually appeared like a whole town, where all the inhabitants ran  about without clothes! it was terrible, but still more terrible to see  how the one knocked and pushed the other, bit each other, and drew one  another about. What was undermost should be topmost, and what was  topmost should be undermost!--See there, now! his leg is longer than  mine!--whip it off, and away with it! There is one that has a little  lump behind the ear, a little innocent lump, but it pains him, and so  it shall pain him still more! And they pecked at it, and they dragged  him about, and they ate him, and all on account of the little lump.  There sat one as still as a little maid, who only wished for peace and  quietness, but she must be brought out and they dragged her, and they  pulled her, and they devoured her!    \"It is quite amusing!\" said the wizard.    \"Yes; but what do you think it is?\" asked Creep-and-Crawl. \"Can you  find it out!\"    \"It is very easy to see,\" said the other, \"it is some great city, they  all resemble each other. A great city it is, that's sure!\"    \"It is ditch-water!\" said Creep-and-Crawl.      ------------        THE HAPPY FAMILY.    Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one  holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it  over one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella,  for it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where  there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and  all this delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which  persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said,  \"Hem, hem! how delicious!\" for they thought it tasted so  delicate--lived on dock leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.    Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails,  they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew  and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the  mastery over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there  stood an apple and a plumb-tree, or else one never would have thought  that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last  venerable old snails.    They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember  very well that there had been many more; that they were of a family  from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was  planted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was  still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house,  and that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were  then placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not;  or, in fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish,  they could not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and  particularly genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the  earth-worms, whom they asked about it could give them any  information,--none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish.    The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the  world, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the  manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver  dish.    Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no  children themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which  they brought up as their own; but the little one would not grow, for  he was of a common family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother  Snail, thought they could observe how he increased in size, and she  begged father, if he could not see it, that he would at least feel the  little snail's shell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was  right.    One day there was a heavy storm of rain.    \"Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock leaves!\" said Father Snail.    \"There are also rain-drops!\" said Mother Snail; \"and now the rain  pours right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I  am very happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one  has his also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures,  sure enough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the  world? We are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock  forest is planted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it  extends, and what there is outside!\"    \"There is nothing at all,\" said Father Snail. \"No place can be better  than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!\"    \"Yes,\" said the dame. \"I would willingly go to the manor-house, be  boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been  treated so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!\"    \"The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!\" said Father Snail.  \"or the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out.  There need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always  in such a tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the  same. Has he not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It  gives me a headache when I look up to him!\"    \"You must not scold him,\" said Mother Snail; \"he creeps so carefully;  he will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live  for! But have you not thought of it?--where shall we get a wife for  him? Do you not think that there are some of our species at a great  distance in the interior of the burdock forest?\"    \"Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,\" said the old  one--\"black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so  conceited. But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us;  they run to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly  know of a wife for our little snail!\"    \"I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!\" said one of the  ants; \"but I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!\"    \"That is nothing!\" said the old folks; \"has she a house?\"    \"She has a palace!\" said the ant--\"the finest ant's palace, with seven  hundred passages!\"    \"I thank you!\" said Mother Snail; \"our son shall not go into an  ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the  commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and  sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.\"    \"We have a wife for him,\" said the gnats; \"at a hundred human paces  from here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry  bush; she is quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a  hundred human paces!\"    \"Well, then, let her come to him!\" said the old ones; \"he has a whole  forest of burdocks, she has only a bush!\"    And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week  before she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one  could thus see that she was of the same species.    And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as  they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the  old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made  a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much  affected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole  forest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was  the best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and  increased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the  course of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on  silver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into  their shells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple  governed in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were  never boiled, and never came on the silver dishes; so from this they  concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the  men in the world were extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of  course it was so. And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make  drum-music for their sake, and the sun shone in order to give the  burdock forest a color for their sakes; and they were very happy, and  the whole family was happy; for they, indeed were so.      ------------        THE STORY OF A MOTHER    A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so  afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed  themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a  deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more  sorrowfully on the little creature.    Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old, man  wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed  it, as it was the cold winter season!
