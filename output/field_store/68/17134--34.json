This is not the best, but it is good. Take a cat, skunk and muskrat  in April, dress them and chop them up fine and put them all in a  glass jar. Put cover on and set them where it is warm so they will  rot in good shape, and in the fall add a little fish oil and you will  have something that will smell right loud.      [Illustration: SOME PET FOXES.]    Most anything that will smell strong is good scent, but no matter how  good your bait and scent is, you must have the trap so the fox can't  smell it, and know how and where to set it. Don't forget to set your  trap where there are foxes. This is one thing to keep in mind, always  set where you see signs. Some think they can set a trap any old way  and place, and ought to make a catch, and then get discouraged. If  you don't get your game the first night try again and keep right on  trying; it is courage and grit that makes a successful trapper. Look  for signs whenever you are in the woods, and study them and the  animals that you want to catch. I always look up places in summer,  and when the time comes to set traps I know just where every trap is  going and how many I want.    I tried a great many times to catch a fox before I was successful. I  remember one time I got an old horse for fox bait in winter, and put  him in a good place. We had a snow storm a few days afterwards, and  boylike I started with my rabbit dog and gun to look for rabbits and  to take a look at my old horse to see if the foxes had begun to feed  on him, and when I got to him he was a sight to behold. The snow was  all trodden down solid around him where they had circled and stood  around and fed on him. That was too much for me. It took the rabbit  fever all out of me for that day, and I started for home to get six  No. 2 1/2 Newhouse traps to set around the horse, and I could not get  home quick enough to suit me.    I had always wanted to catch a fox so bad and I thought the time had  come. I set them as well as I could and covered them up good, as I  thought, and went home. It seemed to me that morning would never  come. I knew I was going to have a fox, so I was up early and started  after it. When I got almost to the bait I saw new tracks going  towards the horse and that made my heart beat a little faster, as I  was sure I had one, but they had gone as near as three feet and that  was as near as they would go. They knew the traps were there as well  as I did, and they never went there as long as my traps were set.        CHAPTER V.    TRAPS AND HINTS.    My idea is that manufacturers make traps too strong for the animal it  is made for, says C. F. Keith. Now the No. 2 is too strong for fox,  and also it is very hard to conceal from view.    Of course if you get a fox in a No. 2 you are more sure than if he is  caught in a No. 1 1/2 or smaller. I use the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse for  fox and I find it the best fox trap made. I have also used the Jump  and the Blake & Lamb, but I do not like them as well. Some trappers  think that the Blake & Lamb are the best mink traps made. I beg leave  to differ with them, for the simple reason that I have lost many a  mink by the trap cutting off the leg and the mink escaping, which  never happens with the Newhouse.    The Blake & Lamb trap are, without doubt, the best trap to conceal,  but when it comes to be the best trap it is not in it with the  Newhouse. I think if trappers would use long chains when using clogs,  they would have better luck in trapping the fox. The kind of traps I  use are the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse for fox, with four foot chains. When I  first began to trap fox I used cheap traps, and many a fox have I  lost by not knowing enough to use good traps. By all means, trappers,  buy good traps in the first place and you will not be sorry.      [Illustration: SILVER AND BLACK FOX SKINS.]    Now let me first give you a few pointers on fox trapping. First,  forget everything you have bought from humbugs and use common sense;  second, study the habits of the fox and you will have better success.  Third, be sure and have your traps in proper shape so the fox can't  smell the iron; fourth, be careful in making a set, use the wooden  paddle or gloved hand in placing dirt over trap; fifth, be sure that  your bait is not scented with human scent, and use cat, skunk, or  muskrat scents.    I have bought scent for many years, but the best scent I can find is  skunk essence or oil of anise. Skunk essence and honey equal parts,  but never use skunk essence in early winter, as it will be a failure.  I have trapped fox for many years and I am very successful and lucky,  and every fall I believe I learn something.    Another thing, never get discouraged, for it is grit that counts.  When a fox turns the trap over reset it and place another trap in the  bed, and you are liable to catch him the first night, but if this  fails, turn trap bottom side up and he will get fooled, sometimes,  not always, for fox trapping is uncertain.    In the first place, when an animal gets into a trap he tears around  for a while, says G. F. Moon, of Dakota, and if the trap be lightly  clogged so he can move around, the trapper most generally finds his  game when he visits the traps. On the other hand, let the trap get  fastened solid and the animal sets his reasoning powers to work; he  finds out that he can chew from the under side of the jaws of the  trap, and that too without giving himself any pain, and finds that he  can easily slip the trap off from the stump of his leg.    Man has been known to do the same thing, when by accident he has been  caught by the leg by a tree or a large rock falling on him. Surely  the animal showed as much reason as the man. I once had a large fox  trap set in a hollow log. The log was about the size of a barrel. A  she fox got into the trap, and as the trap was a good bit out of the  way I did not visit it for several days. When I did visit the trap  the snow was all tramped down by foxes around the log and on the  inside of the log by the fox in the trap. There were the remains of  several rabbits and one whole rabbit fresh killed, one fresh killed  quail and feathers enough to have been on a couple more quail. Now  the question arises, \"Did the other foxes let instinct guide them to  feed the unfortunate fox in the trap? Or did they use their power of  reason?\" I leave that for others to answer.      [Illustration: LIVE SILVER FOX.]        CHAPTER VI.    ALL ROUND LAND SET.    I have made a close study of the red fox for years and the all round  land set is one of my best and latest sets, says J. H. Shufelt, of  Canada. First used last year and took 15 red foxes, and when properly  and carefully set, is the most killing method I ever used.    How to make the scent--This scent should be made in August, of house  cat, muskrat or skunk, chopped fine and put in a two quart glass jar  and sealed until it forms a liquid, and should fill the jar  two-thirds full. Two weeks before using put in the musk of one skunk, one  oz. oil of amber, and enough skunk oil to nearly fill the jar; get a  new paint brush, a small one will do, and see that it is clean, to  use scent with, and it should be kept in the jar.    How to fix trap--I prefer a waxed trap. I find a smoked trap will  rust on the under side after setting about a week. It's not so with a  waxed trap. If properly waxed, water will not rust them. Take a large  kettle of hot water and keep it boiling hot. Melt your beeswax in a  cup or dish and pour on the water; now take your traps, six at a  time, and dip them, and the wax will adhere to them; just leave the  traps in the water long enough to warm them a little, when the wax  will spread evenly over them; drain over kettle and hang up to dry a  week before using. One half pound of wax is sufficient for three  dozen traps and chains and will last one trapping season.      [Illustration: NOVEMBER CATCH.]    How to set the trap--I use rubber boots and set in the morning when  the dew is on the grass or on a wet day. The set should be made near  the foxes' runways or on high ground; dig out a place the size of  your trap, take something with you to put the trap and dirt on--for  this purpose I use a piece of oil cloth, two feet square--fill all  around outside of your trap with fine dirt, and put a large leaf over  your trap. I use a large leaf from a first growth basswood. As soon  as they fall from the tree I gather them and lay them flat together  in the mud until I want them to use. Why I prefer this particular  kind of leaf is, they grow so large that one leaf covers the trap.  After the leaf is over your trap cover with fine dirt or something  that must be in keeping with the surroundings. Now stand in one place  and take your brush from the jar and paint a circle about two feet in  diameter, the width of your brush on the grass all around your trap.  This should be repeated once or twice a week, especially after a  heavy rain storm. Nothing can steal your bait, John Sneak'um cannot  locate your trap.    When visiting your traps carry an extra trap along, and when you make  a catch set a clean trap by exchanging traps; always clean your trap  after making a catch before setting again. Now boys, start in right,  by using a good trap with a large pan, one that can be easily  concealed. Don't try to catch a fox with a weak trap, for you will  only be disappointed and at the same time be educating another fox,  and he will make the rest shy, for they often travel in pairs. When  making your sets, don't disturb anything around the place nor use a  bush drag where there hasn't been one, for the fox is quick to  notice. Use a grapple that can be concealed under your trap. Just try  and see how slick a set you can make and try and learn the habits of  the animal you are trying to catch, for that is the key to success.        CHAPTER VII.    SNOW SETS."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#3)"],[1," house and you have  one of the best inducements for a bear to catch.    For mink or marten traps a smoked rat makes five good sized baits,  neck and head one; each quarter one. Do not throw away the tail. It  stands in the same relationship as a tidbit to an animal as a  beaver's tail does to a trapper. Therefore at the trap where you want  an extra inducement, twist the tail about the rest of the bait and  tie it to keep in place.    During the very cold months partridge and rabbit meat keeps good a  long while in the hard frozen state, but as an all round lasting bait  for mild or cold weather, good for either mink or marten, I have used  with great success both the windpipe and tail of the ox. The tail  has, of course, to be skinned while fresh, and I cut off a ring or  two of either the windpipe or tail and run a sharp stick through each  piece, and carry them in my bait bag with the sticks in. When I want  one for a trap I pull out the stick and the hole is there ready to  place on the proper bait stick. A tail will make ten generous baits,  likewise the windpipe.    All fish bait is good for mink, but the majority decompose so quickly  that unless hard smoked it drops off the bait stick in a few hours  and is eaten by the mice on the ground, or very soon disappears by  the action of the earth and evaporation. As a lasting fish bait  (unsmoked) I have found the sucker or carp the very best; they are a  fleshy fish with no inside to speak of, and a very tough skin. One of  about twelve or fourteen inches long will give sufficient bait for  ten traps.      [Illustration: CAUGHT IN MIDWINTER.]    In setting mink traps along the shore of lake or river I take the  fish whole in the canoe, and as I set a trap cut off a section with  my belt axe, beginning with the tail. Each bait will be an inch or an  inch and a quarter broad lengthways of the fish. You make your bait  stick very sharp and run it through crossways of the section,  piercing the skin on both sides. Long after the flesh part of the  fish has rotted and fallen away, the skin ring will be yet in  evidence shriveled up dry on the stick, but yet useful as bait.    In using partridge or rabbits for bait, it is very much towards their  lasting powers to not remove the skin or feathers. Cut the section  you want with a very sharp axe, run your bait stick through the  portion of meat and plaster down close on top all the feathers, hair  or skin and tie securely if in mild weather. If in cold weather, all  that is necessary is to place each bait stick, primed, out of doors  over night, and the next day you can carry them in your bait bag like  so many knots.    In conclusion will say that a few drops of oil of anise is the best  alluring scent I have found for mink. A final word of advice. Unless  your traps in water-set always have a tossing pole, otherwise when  you visit your line you may have the chagrin to find only the paw  instead of the animal. As the minister says, one more word. If it is  your intention to return on your tracks when visiting your trap road,  be sure and clean out, bait and reset each trap as you go. In mild  weather or towards spring, animals run as well in daytime as at  night, and I have often, by observing this rule, found on my return  at different times almost all kinds of animals caught while I was at  the other end of the road.        CHAPTER V.    BAIT AND SCENT.    The mink is very hard to catch, as all or most all experienced  trappers tell us, so therefore we must believe them, says an  experienced Canadian trapper. Some say that mink are afraid of human  scent. In one sense they are but in another they are not, as I will  prove to you in the following paragraph:    While I was trapping on Twenty Mile Creek in Ontario I had an  occasion to go my rounds very early one morning. I had not gone far  before I ran onto a large mink track, and as the snow was only here  and there in small patches I did not follow it. I returned the same  way to get a skunk I had hidden, and on reaching this particular spot  I saw as before, my tracks going one way and Mr. Mink's another. I  never thought any more about it until I came to the next patch of  snow, and there were his newly made tracks beside my own, and some  were discerned in the same prints as I had made, so that must prove  that he wasn't afraid of human scent there. If that mink had been  afraid of human scent he most certainly would have avoided my tracks,  but as it was he saw me coming and hid somewhere until I was past.      [Illustration: NORTHWESTERN SKINS.]    I do not say that a person can drop a trap down anywhere, set any old  way, and catch mink; but I do say that it all depends where the human  scent is. If a man sets a trap and handles it with his hands or any  other foolish thing, he will catch but very few mink.    My way of setting a trap for a mink is this: Find a den or hollow log  in the vicinity where mink tracks are seen. After you have found the  place where you intend setting your trap, set it in the following  way: Cut a hole in the ground at the entrance shaped like a straight  stemmed pipe, only make it large enough for the trap to set in  nicely. After that, set the trap, twisting the spring around to the  same side of the trap as already excavated, and taking the dirt you  have the pan, placing the trap in the place you have taken out, cover  the trap with it, being careful not to let any lump or pebble lay at  the base of the jaws, as it prevents them from closing tightly, and  your mink may get away.    For bait, take the tail, front and hind legs of a muskrat, also a  small piece of flesh, or better yet the entrails, and place them in  the hole, being careful not to set it too close, but close enough so  that the mink will have to step on the pan of the trap. It is better  to have it too far back than too close, as you then run a better  chance of getting your mink. Also have some musk or some reliable  scent, and put a few drops on a stick a short distance from the trap.  After all of this be very careful in brushing out all signs, and make  everything look as natural as possible, depart, and I know from  experience that you can catch a mink, providing you follow the  directions above.    In order to trap very shy animals use no bait of any kind, but set  your traps where they are sure to go and you can capture the shyest  mink, says a Maine trapper. The places where mink are sure to go are  into holes, dens, hollow stumps and logs, and to make a success you  want a trap set at all the places. If there isn't any, make some any  time in the summer for the coming season.    The right size and best kind of trap for mink is the Blake & Lamb No.  1. Have them free from rust and foreign odors, as mink have keen  smelling organs; boil them in ashes and water, also boil them again  in a kettle filled with fir or cedar twigs, and after they are dried  and when hot rub them all over with beeswax, and when set cover  carefully and fasten to something movable.    In the fall of the year use no scent, but in the spring when they are  running around use their own musk, mixed with fish oil and salt to  preserve it. This is my way to trap mink without bait, and I have  captured large numbers of them.    I claim that animals are their own best scent. If experience is worth  anything I am sure of it. About the first trapping I ever did (1877)  I ran out of mink bait and came across a rivulet running into the  main creek and mink track in plenty. Well, what was I to do? I must  set a trap. I took a piece of the hind quarter of a mink. Being a  green hand at the business I did not know whether it would work or  not. But the next time I visited my trap I found out the plan was a  success, for I had Mr. Mink safe and sound. Ever since I have had  occasion to use the same for bait.    Another illustration I will give which proves beyond question that  this theory is a correct one: In 1878 I set a trap in a hole in the  bank, the water not freezing all winter, but ran a stream over the  trap, out of the hole. I used no bait. But I believe I caught every  mink coming that way. Every mink caught of course would freshen up  the place with his musk. The result was 15 mink. I believe other  animals are the same; but skunk and civet are not so particular what  they eat; anything half decomposed or rotten will answer.    The civet is very troublesome when they find your mink trap. In  setting in water (he will not go in water if he can help it) he will  make a hole at one side and get your bait in spite of you. At other  times he will crawl over all your stagings and reach in, like a  monkey, apparently as limber as Indian rubber, and get your bait. In  dry land sets they walk right into your trap and you can get rid of  them.      [Illustration: TRAPPERS \"SHACK\".]    A few words about scent. I never did believe in mixing a lot of stuff  together as some say, says a Canadian trapper. Now if a mink is  attracted by the odor of fish oil or the scent of muskrat musk or of  blood or the scent of the female mink, that does not say that we  should mix them all together and expect it to catch every mink that  comes along. Would you expect the mink to distinguish the smell of  each of these substances when they are all mixed together? If we like  chicken, sweet potatoes, chocolate cake and mince pie, would it make  it better to mix all these things together? I don't think we would  like it.    As for the fox, the very best scent or decoy is the matrix of the  female fox, as has been described so often, but it is hard to get.  Next to this I think comes skunk essence and it should be sprinkled  around quite freely, as the fox is not afraid of it, like some  trappers are, and it also helps to kill the smell of the iron of the  trap. Now don't think by this that you should rub it on the trap.  Just sprinkle it around the trap.    But none of these scents will attract an animal as"]]]
