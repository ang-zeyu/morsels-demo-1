But just at the spot  where our oak raised its head very far above all the trees around it,  the impatient stream gradually changed its manner of proceeding, and  began to run more slowly, as if desirous of remaining a little longer  in such a delightful spot. So, after quietly winding backwards and  forwards for some time, it spread itself out at last into the form of a  most beautiful little pond, through which the current was so slow that  it was hardly perceptible.    The gentleman to whom this valley, and the country around it, belonged,  had spent many hundreds of pounds, and had employed the most skilful  people he could find, in making his gardens and pleasure-grounds as gay  and beautiful as possible. And yet, if you had walked all over his  property, you would have said that no part of it was half so lovely as  this little retired valley, where the art of man had never done  anything to add to its exceeding beauty. The gardener's spade and  pruning-knife had never been used here. Everything you saw was fresh  and unaltered from the hand of God himself.    I think the most beautiful part was the pond, and the open space just  around it; for here the finest wild-flowers grew in abundance, and the  noble oak-tree was so near, that, when the winds of autumn came down  the valley, the trout, that delighted to swim in those pure waters,  were sometimes startled by a shower of acorns, falling down from the  outermost branches, and making a terrible splash over their heads.    I have not time to describe more than a very few of the plants which  were to be found in the pond and on its banks. There was the  water-lily, with its large green leaves laying flat upon the water, and  its splendid white flowers, just raising their heads above the surface;  the flowering-rush, which bears a bunch of beautiful pink blossoms on a  high tapering stem; and the buckbean, which, though at a distance it  does not look so grand as the other two, has such an exquisitely  beautiful fringe on its pinky-white flowers, that the most skilful  painter has never yet been able to produce even a tolerable imitation  of it.    Many other lovely plants there were growing round the pond, and in  other parts of this delightful little valley: plants which exceeded in  beauty many of those we cultivate with so much care in our gardens and  hot-houses. But when I began this little history I meant to write about  \"Squirrels and other Animals,\" and not to give a description of plants.  We must therefore return to our friends in the oak-tree.          CHAPTER III.      After the departure of their children the squirrels felt, as you may  suppose, rather dull and lonely at first, but they very wisely made use  of a remedy for low spirits, which I would strongly recommend to you,  whenever you find yourself melancholy or uncomfortable in your mind  from any cause. And particularly when you are so, _without_ any  apparent cause; for we sometimes see people very dismal and melancholy,  when they have every good thing they can wish, and _ought_ to be  cheerful and happy. This wonderful and never failing remedy for low  spirits is _employment_! Try it, my dear melancholy young reader, and  whether you have a good reason for your sadness or not, you will at  least have met with something worth remembering in this history.    Our squirrels, then, instead of sitting moping side by side on a bough,  and grumbling out to each other, \"What miserable creatures we are!\"  instead of thus giving way to their melancholy thoughts, they  immediately began to make use of the _remedy_ I have mentioned. The  first thing they did was carefully to examine the nest, to see what  repairs it stood in need of. It would at any rate require a fresh  lining of moss and leaves; so all the old bedding, which I must confess  was rather dusty and untidy, was taken off, and kicked out of the hole,  together with a quantity of nut-shells and other rubbish, which had  been collecting there for some months. When this work was finished, it  was found that the under part, or groundwork of the nest, which  consisted of small twigs and fibres curiously interlaced, was very  rotten, and required to be almost entirely renewed. So there was plenty  of work to do, and very diligently the squirrels laboured to complete  it. Not that they worked like slaves, from morning till night. Oh no!  they allowed themselves abundance of time for feasting and fun, for  they were such merry, light-hearted creatures, that they could not live  without a good game of play now and then. They even mixed play with  their work; for when they had to go to a little distance for some  particularly fine soft moss, or other materials for nest-building, they  were sure to have a race, to try which of them could reach the place  first. So the days passed by right merrily.    \"It is very odd,\" said Brush, one evening, just before he rolled  himself up for the night in the warm _blanket_ I have before mentioned;  \"It is very odd that we should have lived almost all our lives so near  that family of water-rats, in the bank of the pond, and have known so  little about them. I always thought them a savage, bloodthirsty, set of  fellows, and that they would make no scruple of killing fish, or young  birds, or mice, or any other small animal that they could master. But  what do you think Gotobed told me just now, as I came up the tree? Why,  he says, that it is all a mistake, and that he is certain that these  water-rats are a very decent, quiet sort of people, feeding on  vegetables, like ourselves. He says, that as he was creeping about just  now among the grass, close to the edge of the pond, but a long way from  the water-rats' holes, which are all on the opposite side, he suddenly  found himself quite close to one of these creatures, who was perched up  on a flat stone, and busily gnawing the root of some plant. Our poor  little cousin, you know, has not much presence of mind, so in his  fright, and terrible hurry to escape from the monster, he slipped off  the bank, and rolled into the water. The splash he made frightened the  rat, who plumped into the water too, and so there they were both  swimming close together. Gotobed expected to be eaten up in a minute,  but the rat only said to him, 'Ha! ha! little fellow, is it only you?  Not much used to swimming I see! But come down some fine evening, and  I'll teach you. The water is too cold just now for such as you.'    \"Gotobed was too much frightened to say a word, so he scrambled up the  bank, and ran home to his nest as fast as possible. Poor little thing!  he looked so miserable, with his beautiful fur dripping wet, and  sticking close to his body.\"    \"What a ridiculous story,\" said Mrs. Brush, who could hardly keep  herself awake till it was finished; \"Why I have heard Gotobed say, that  his mother used to tell a story about a relation of hers, who lived a  good way off, who was killed and eaten up in a moment, by one of these  very water-rats. I have even heard it said, that the males will often  kill and eat the young ones, if their mothers are not careful to hide  them. Depend upon it, they are a horrid set, and I often wish they did  not live quite so near us.\"    \"Well,\" said Brush, gaping, \"I'll try to find out something more about  them to-morrow; but I declare I can't keep awake any longer just now.\"    So the next afternoon, our squirrel, who had some courage, and a great  deal of curiosity, determined, if possible, to learn something about  the character of these water-rats, one of whom, by a kind word spoken  to little Gotobed, had so altered his opinion of their disposition and  manner of living.    Brush chose the afternoon for his visit, because he had observed that  these animals came out of their holes more at that time than in the  middle of the day. But our inquisitive friend did not allow his  curiosity to lead him into any danger, in this inquiry into the  proceedings of his neighbours. He therefore crept through the high  grass to the other side of the pond, and very quietly climbed up into a  low willow-tree, overhanging the bank, in which the water-rats had made  their habitations. Here, concealed among the leaves, he had a full view  of all that passed below.    Close to the steep bank, in which these animals had bored many round  holes, was a small flat space of fine pebbles and sand, sloping down  into the water on one side, and on the other, bordered by a thick bed  of the sweet-smelling water-mint, with here and there a stem of the  plant called horsetail, towering up like a gigantic palm-tree in the  midst of a forest. On this pleasant little pebbly beach, Brush  perceived several water-rats, both old and young; and some very grave  looking faces were peeping out of their holes in the bank, watching the  proceedings of their companions below.    One of those on the beach had his attention entirely engaged by the  root of some plant, which he was nibbling; another was busily cleaning  his fur with his fore-paws; and two very young ones were paddling about  in the shallow water, into which their mother, as Brush supposed, had  taken them, for the first time in their lives, to give them a lesson in  swimming. Sometimes one of the grave looking gentlemen in the bank,  either for amusement, or in search of food, would leap, or rather  _tumble_, from the mouth of his hole, into the water, and dive at once  to the bottom, with the greatest ease imaginable; but he could not  remain under much more than a minute at a time, for want of breath.  When he came up again to the surface, Brush was exceedingly surprised  to see that, instead of appearing wet and miserable, like poor little  Gotobed after his ducking, his hair was as dry as if he had never been  into the water at all.    \"How delightful it must be to dive and swim about like that!\" said the  squirrel to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33502"],[0,"My Knitting Book (#3)"],[1,"end.    Knit one row, decreasing one stitch at each end.    Knit a fancy row as before.      _Third_--coloured.    Pearl one row, decreasing one stitch at each end.    Knit one row, decreasing one stitch at each end.    Knit one row, _without_ decreasing.    Knit the fancy row as before.      _Fourth_, _Fifth_, _Sixth_, _Seventh_--    The third division is to be repeated, alternately with white and  coloured wool.      _Eighth_--white. _Ninth_--coloured.    In these two last divisions, only two stitches are to be decreased in  each; this is to be done in the row after the pearl,--decreasing one  stitch at each end.    N.B. There should be forty-six stitches left on the needle in the last  row.    Pick up thirty stitches on each side, and make the borders at the sides  and back like that in front.    Make up the cap by turning in the border to the fancy row, and hem it  all round: it is to be tied behind, and under the chin, with ribbons or  plaited wool, with tassels of the same.          A Sontag, or Cephaline      The border for this cap is worked the same as the preceding,--casting on  one hundred and two stitches;--single German wool;--No. 15 needles.    Knit one row in white, to bring the pearl on the right side. Then,--    With the darkest shade, bring the wool round the needle, pearl two  together; pearl one.--Repeat to the end of the row.    In the next row--bring the wool forward, knit two together; knit  one.--Repeat to the end of the row.    Knit forty-two rows in the same manner, taking in one stitch at the end  of almost every row, so that the number of stitches in the last row is  reduced to seventy-two, taking care to keep the pattern regular, and  changing the colour every two rows.    Take up forty stitches, on each side, and knit one row of white round  all the three sides: knit another row to make the pearl, and finish the  border with white and coloured wool, as in the preceding cap. Finish  with ribbons, or cords and tassels.    The border is knitted in white, and the middle shade of whatever colour  is used in the head piece. This is prettiest in five distinct shades of  any colour, with one or two rows of white between each division of  shade.          A Bonnet Cap.      Cast on ninety stitches, in hair-brown German wool, for border.--No. 16  needles.    _First, second, and third rows_--plain knitting.    _Fourth row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together. Then,--    Commence with another colour--say white.    _Fifth, sixth, and seventh rows_--plain knitting.    _Eighth row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together.    Repeat these last four rows seven times: then the brown border as  before. They form a band of about four inches wide, which is to be drawn  up at the two ends, and strings attached to tie it close to the chin.    Then, cast on forty stitches and commence another band with the brown  border as above,--three rows of the pattern in white, and repeat the  brown border. This is to be sewn or knitted on to the head piece, and  forms the band for the back. A ribbon is to be run through it, to tie it  close to the head.          Double Knitting for Comforters, etc.      Large-sized needles, No. 1, and four-thread fleecy, will be required.    Cast on any even number of stitches.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; pass the wool back, knit  one, turning the wool twice round the needle.--Repeat to the end of the  row.

Slip the first stitch, keeping the wool in front of the needle; turn the  wool round the needle, so as to bring it in front again; knit two  together, taken in front. Continue turning the wool round the needle,  and knitting two together, to the end of the row. All the rows are the  same.    The two stitches, which are to be taken together, appear always as if  tied together.          A Muff, in colours of Sable.      Cast on seventy or eighty stitches.    _First, second, and third rows_--plain knitting.    _Fourth row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together, taken at the  back.--Repeat to the end of the row.    Repeat these four rows, until the piece be about eighteen inches long,  admitting that the shading comes in correctly.    Two No. 8 needles are required, and double German wool, in four distinct  shades to match the colour of sable. Commence with the lightest  shade,--then the second, third, and darkest, reversing them again to the  lightest.          Another Muff.      Cast on forty-five stitches.--No. 8 needles.    Every row is worked the same, with a slip-stitch at the beginning;--knit  one; pearl one.--Repeat to the end of the row.
