Bolder still, the Wasp has taken possession of the dwelling-house. On  my door-sill, in a soil of rubbish, nestles the White-banded Sphex:  when I go indoors, I must be careful not to damage her burrows, not to  tread upon the miner absorbed in her work. It is quite a quarter of a  century since I last saw the saucy Cricket-hunter. When I made her  acquaintance, I used to visit her at a few miles' distance: each time,  it meant an expedition under the blazing August sun. To-day I find her  at my door; we are intimate neighbours. The embrasure of the closed  window provides an apartment of a mild temperature for the Pelopaeus.  (A species of Mason-wasp--Translator's Note.) The earth-built nest is  fixed against the freestone wall. To enter her home, the  Spider-huntress uses a little hole left open by accident in the  shutters. On the mouldings of the Venetian blinds, a few stray  Mason-bees build their group of cells; inside the outer shutters, left  ajar, a Eumenes (Another Mason-wasp--Translator's Note.) constructs her  little earthen dome, surmounted by a short, bell-mouthed neck. The  Common Wasp and the Polistes (A Wasp that builds her nest in  trees--Translator's Note.) are my dinner-guests: they visit my table to  see if the grapes served are as ripe as they look.    Here surely--and the list is far from complete--is a company both  numerous and select, whose conversation will not fail to charm my  solitude, if I succeed in drawing it out, my dear beasts of former  days, my old friends, and others, more recent acquaintances, all are  here, hunting, foraging, building in close proximity. Besides, should  we wish to vary the scene of observation, the mountain (Mont Ventoux,  an outlying summit of the Alps, 6,270 feet high.--Translator's Note.)  is but a few hundred steps away, with its tangle of arbutus, rock-roses  and arborescent heather; with its sandy spaces dear to the Bembeces;  with its marly slopes exploited by different Wasps and Bees. And that  is why, foreseeing these riches, I have abandoned the town for the  village and come to Serignan to weed my turnips and water my lettuces.    Laboratories are being founded at great expense, on our Atlantic and  Mediterranean coasts, where people cut up small sea-animals, of but  meagre interest to us; they spend a fortune on powerful microscopes,  delicate dissecting-instruments, engines of capture, boats,  fishing-crews, aquariums, to find out how the yolk of an Annelid's (A  red-blooded Worm.--Translator's Note.) egg is constructed, a question  whereof I have never yet been able to grasp the full importance; and  they scorn the little land-animal, which lives in constant touch with  us, which provides universal psychology with documents of inestimable  value, which too often threatens the public wealth by destroying our  crops. When shall we have an entomological laboratory for the study not  of the dead insect, steeped in alcohol, but of the living insect; a  laboratory having for its object the instinct, the habits, the manner  of living, the work, the struggles, the propagation of that little  world with which agriculture and philosophy have most seriously to  reckon? To know thoroughly the history of the destroyer of our vines  might perhaps be more important than to know how this or that  nerve-fibre of a Cirriped ends (Cirripeds are sea-animals with  hair-like legs, including the Barnacles and Acorn-shells.--Translator's  Note.); to establish by experiment the line of demarcation between  intellect and instinct; to prove, by comparing facts in the zoological  progression, whether human reason be an irreducible faculty or not: all  this ought surely to take precedence of the number of joints in a  Crustacean's antenna. These enormous questions would need an army of  workers; and we have not one. The fashion is all for the Mollusc and  the Zoophyte. (Zoophytes are plant-like sea-animals, including  Star-fishes, Jelly-fishes, Sea-anemones, and Sponges.--Translator's  Note.) The depths of the sea are explored with many drag-nets; the soil  which we tread is consistently disregarded. While waiting for the  fashion to change, I open my harmas laboratory of living entomology;  and this laboratory shall not cost the ratepayers one farthing.        CHAPTER 2. THE GREEN GRASSHOPPER.    We are in the middle of July. The astronomical dog-days are just  beginning; but in reality the torrid season has anticipated the  calendar and for some weeks past the heat has been overpowering.    This evening in the village they are celebrating the National Festival.  (The 14th of July, the anniversary of the fall of the  Bastille.--Translator's Note.) While the little boys and girls are  hopping round a bonfire whose gleams are reflected upon the  church-steeple, while the drum is pounded to mark the ascent of each  rocket, I am sitting alone in a dark corner, in the comparative  coolness that prevails at nine o'clock, harking to the concert of the  festival of the fields, the festival of the harvest, grander by far  than that which, at this moment, is being celebrated in the village  square with gunpowder, lighted torches, Chinese lanterns and, above  all, strong drink. It has the simplicity of beauty and the repose of  strength.    It is late; and the Cicadae are silent. Glutted with light and heat,  they have indulged in symphonies all the livelong day. The advent of  the night means rest for them, but a rest frequently disturbed. In the  dense branches of the plane-trees a sudden sound rings out like a cry  of anguish, strident and short. It is the desperate wail of the Cicada,  surprised in his quietude by the Green Grasshopper, that ardent  nocturnal huntress, who springs upon him, grips him in the side, opens  and ransacks his abdomen. An orgy of music, followed by butchery.    I have never seen and never shall see that supreme expression of our  national revelry, the military review at Longchamp; nor do I much  regret it. The newspapers tell me as much about it as I want to know.  They give me a sketch of the site. I see, installed here and there amid  the trees, the ominous Red Cross, with the legend, \"Military Ambulance;  Civil Ambulance.\" There will be bones broken, apparently; cases of  sunstroke; regrettable deaths, perhaps. It is all provided for and all  in the programme.    Even here, in my village, usually so peaceable, the festival will not  end, I am ready to wager, without the exchange of a few blows, that  compulsory seasoning of a day of merry-making. No pleasure, it appears,  can be fully relished without an added condiment of pain.    Let us listen and meditate far from the tumult. While the disembowelled  Cicada utters his protest, the festival up there in the plane-trees is  continued with a change of orchestra. It is now the time of the  nocturnal performers. Hard by the place of slaughter, in the green  bushes, a delicate ear perceives the hum of the Grasshoppers. It is the  sort of noise that a spinning-wheel makes, a very unobtrusive sound, a  vague rustle of dry membranes rubbed together. Above this dull bass  there rises, at intervals, a hurried, very shrill, almost metallic  clicking. There you have the air and the recitative, intersected by  pauses. The rest is the accompaniment.    Despite the assistance of a bass, it is a poor concert, very poor  indeed, though there are about ten executants in my immediate vicinity.  The tone lacks intensity. My old tympanum is not always capable of  perceiving these subtleties of sound. The little that reaches me is  extremely sweet and most appropriate to the calm of twilight. Just a  little more breadth in your bow-stroke, my dear Green Grasshopper, and  your technique would be better than the hoarse Cicada's, whose name and  reputation you have been made to usurp in the countries of the north.    Still, you will never equal your neighbour, the little bell-ringing  Toad, who goes tinkling all round, at the foot of the plane-trees,  while you click up above. He is the smallest of my batrachian folk and  the most venturesome in his expeditions.    How often, at nightfall, by the last glimmers of daylight, have I not  come upon him as I wandered through my garden, hunting for ideas!  Something runs away, rolling over and over in front of me. Is it a dead  leaf blown along by the wind? No, it is the pretty little Toad  disturbed in the midst of his pilgrimage. He hurriedly takes shelter  under a stone, a clod of earth, a tuft of grass, recovers from his  excitement and loses no time in picking up his liquid note.    On this evening of national rejoicing, there are nearly a dozen of him  tinkling against one another around me. Most of them are crouching  among the rows of flower-pots that form a sort of lobby outside my  house. Each has his own note, always the same, lower in one case,  higher in another, a short, clear note, melodious and of exquisite  purity.    With their slow, rhythmical cadence, they seem to be intoning litanies.  \"Cluck,\" says one; \"click,\" responds another, on a finer note; \"clock,\"  adds a third, the tenor of the band. And this is repeated indefinitely,  like the bells of the village pealing on a holiday: \"cluck, click,  clock; cluck, click, clock!\"    The batrachian choristers remind me of a certain harmonica which I used  to covet when my six-year-old ear began to awaken to the magic of  sounds. It consisted of a series of strips of glass of unequal length,  hung on two stretched tapes. A cork fixed to a wire served as a hammer.  Imagine an unskilled hand striking at random on this key-board, with a  sudden clash of octaves, dissonances and topsy-turvy chords; and you  will have a pretty clear idea of the Toads' litany.    As a song, this litany has neither head nor tail to it; as a collection  of pure sounds, it is delicious. This is the case with all the music in  nature's concerts. Our ear discovers superb notes in it and then  becomes refined and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37566"],[0,"Natural History of the Ornate Box Turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata Agassiz (#3)"],[1,"chiefly Cottonwood, American Elm, Red Mulberry, and Black Willow  (_Salix nigra_). The only trees growing on the pasture itself were a  few small Osage Orange, none of which bore fruit.    Paths were worn along fences by cattle and in several places near the  fence, usually beneath shade trees, there were large bare places where  cattle congregated. Vegetation near paths and bare places was weedy  and in some places there were tall stands of Smooth Sumac (_Rhus  glabra_).    Rich stands of prairie grasses occurred along the top of the hill in  the pasture; bluestems (_Andropogon gerardi_, _A. scoparius_) were the  dominant species and Switchgrass (_Panicum virgatum_) and Indian grass  (_Sorghastrum nutans_) were scattered throughout. A number of small  areas on top of the hill were moderately overgrazed, as indicated by  mixture of native grasses with an association of shorter plants  consisting chiefly of Ragweed (_Ambrosia artemisiifolia_ var.  _elatior_), Mugwort (_Artemisia ludoviciana_), Japanese Chess (_Bromus  japonicus_), and Asters (_Aster_ sp.).    The upper parts of the hillsides were overgrazed moderately to  heavily. Limestone rocks of various sizes were partly embedded in soil  or lay loose at the surface. Depressions beneath rocks provided  shelter for box turtles as well as for other small vertebrates. Native  grasses were sparse in this area and gave way to Sideoats Grama  (_Bouteloua curtipendula_), extensive patches of Smooth Sumac, and  scattered colonies of Buckbrush.    Tall grasses were dominant on the lower hillsides and small patches of  Slough grass (_Spartina pectinata_) grew in moist areas. Ravines  originated at small intermittent springs on the sides of the hill. The  banks of ravines were high and steep and more or less bare of  vegetation. High, dense stands of Slough grass grew at intermittent  springs and along the courses of ravines; sedges (_Carex_, sp.) grew  where small pools of water formed and created marshy conditions.  Prairie grasses along the tops of ravine embankments formed a narrow  overhanging canopy of vegetation that was accentuated in many places  where the sod was under-cut by erosion or by the activities of  burrowing animals (Pl. 18, Fig. 1). Box turtles frequently sought  shelter beneath this vegetational canopy or burrowed beneath the sod.    On the highest part of the pasture near the entry road several small  areas were nearly bare, presumably because of heavy overgrazing;  grasses (except for scattered clumps of _Bouteloua curtipendula_ and  _Setaria lutescens_) were absent and dominant vegetation consisted of  Buffalo-bur (_Solanum rostratum_), Blue Vervain (_Verbena hastata_),  Mullein (_Verbascum Thapsus_), Ragweed, Asters, and a few Prickly Pear  (_Opuntia humifusa_). Two small areas on the pasture completely lacked  vegetation; these may have been wallows or the sites of old  salt-licks.    Three shallow stock ponds, behind earthen dikes in ravines, were  present on the pasture. The pond near the farm buildings (\"House  Pond\") and that in the southwestern part of the pasture (\"Far Pond\")  were present when studies of box turtles were begun. The largest pond,  in a deep ravine in the northern part of the pasture, was constructed  in June, 1956, and became filled in approximately one month (Pls. 16  and 18). Pond embankments were chiefly bare of vegetation because of  trampling by cattle; in a few places at the edge of the water, or in  places too steep for cattle to walk, there were small patches of  weeds, sedges, and Slough Grass. The ponds contained some water at all  times of the year. The only vertebrates permanently inhabiting the  ponds in the course of my studies were Bullfrogs (_Rana catesbeiana_)  and Leopard frogs (_Rana pipiens_).    The three parts of the pasture in which studies were concentrated were  designated as separate subdivisions. The northwest corner area (28  acres) was triangular and bounded on two sides by rock fences and on  its third side by a deep ravine. The southern ravine area (17 acres)  constituted the part of the lower southern hillside drained by a  series of ravines. The house pond area (seven acres) surrounded \"House  Pond.\" Habitat in these three subdivisions of the pasture was  especially favorable for box turtles.      Materials and Methods    Observations were made at the Damm Farm on 102 days in the two-year  period beginning in Autumn, 1954; observations were concentrated in  the period from May to October although some observations were made in  every month, January and February excepted. Field work was done  chiefly in daylight hours but a few trips were made to the study area  at night.    Routine handling of each turtle captured at the Damm Farm consisted  of: marking, weighing and measuring turtle; recording the exact place  of capture, body temperature and environmental temperature; and,  recording miscellaneous items such as the presence of ectoparasites,  injuries, distinctive markings, and in some instances, the approximate  age of the turtle.    Excursions on the Damm Farm were made on foot in 1954 and 1955, and,  in 1956, on horseback. By using a horse, more ground could be covered  per unit of time, a better view could be obtained of immediate  surroundings, and, cattle on the area, being accustomed to horses, did  not become agitated as they would when unmounted persons were nearby.    The entire study area could not be inspected thoroughly in a single  day. It was usually more profitable to find and mark turtles along  fences, in ravines, or in other open areas, and subsequently to follow  their movements away from these areas by means of trailing threads.  Turtles could be observed from a distance through binoculars.  Cultivated areas were regularly scanned with binoculars but turtles  were seldom seen there. Behavior was observed by sitting motionless on  rock fences or in a blind on top of a stepladder.    No box turtles were removed from the study area. Specimens obtained in  other areas were used for studies of growth, reproduction, and food  habits. Measurements, weights, and data concerning temperature and  ectoparasites were obtained from specimens collected elsewhere as well  as from individuals on study areas.    Turtles were obtained by hand-collecting and in unbaited traps; the  number captured in a single day ranged from 12 to none. Traps, like  those used by Packard (1956:9) for tree squirrels, were set in the  mouths of burrows and dens, or--with leads to channel animals into the  trap--along ravines and rock fences. Traps set in the open were  covered to prevent death of turtles from overheating in direct  sunlight. Live-trapping provided much valuable data, although quail,  rabbits, opossums, and box turtles were caught with about equal  frequency in the traps.    Turtles were marked by notching the marginal scutes of the carapace by  means of a hacksaw blade, following the code system described by Cagle  (1939). Notches, one eighth to one quarter of an inch deep and wide  could be cut more quickly than filed and were more evident than  drilled holes which often became plugged with soil and obscured.  Hatchlings and juveniles were notched with a sharp knife.    Movements of individual turtles were studied by means of a  turtle-trailing device--similar to the kind first described by Breder  (1927) and later modified by Stickel (1950:355-356)--a tin can, cut to  fit the shell of a turtle, with an axle that bore a spool of thread  (Pl. 27, Fig. 1). The device was taped to the turtle; the free end of  the thread was tied to a stationary object. Thread payed out from the  spool through a guide-loop and marked the course of the turtle as it  moved away from the starting point. Because of its great strength and  elasticity (as compared to cotton), nylon sewing thread was used in  trailers. Ordinarily, turtles were unable to break the thread if it  became snarled or was expended. Cattle frequently tangled the thread  and displaced it but did not often break it. Ordinary spools were cut  down on a lathe so they would hold 600 to 800 yards of thread.  Turtle-trailing provided an accurate record of where and how far a  turtle had traveled, and to a lesser extent, the sort of activity in  which the turtle had been engaged (evidence of feeding, forms, or  trial nest holes). Trailers seemed not to alter the normal activity of  turtles.    Prominent landmarks were rare or wanting in most places on the  pasture. Locations of captures (or reference points in the movements  of trailer-turtles) were determined by triangulation with a Brunton  compass, using trees along fences as known points of reference. Rough  maps were made in the field and used later, along with compass  readings and measurements, to make a more precise record of movements  and captures on a large map (scale, 100 feet to one inch) of the study  area. Mapped points of capture in grassy areas were accurate within  ten to twenty feet; points of capture in areas where landmarks were  nearby were nearly exact. Areas were measured with a planimeter;  distances traveled by individuals were measured with a cartometer.    Turtles were measured in the field to the nearest millimeter with  large wooden calipers (of the type used by shoe salesmen) and a clear  plastic ruler. Measurements in the laboratory, especially in studies  of growth, were made, to the nearest tenth of a millimeter with dial  calipers. Measurements made on each specimen examined in the field  were: length of carapace, width of carapace, length of plastron (sum  of lengths of forelobe and hind lobe), width of plastron (at hinge),  and height. All measurements were made in a straight line. A spring  scale of 500 gram capacity, used in the field, gave weights accurately  within three grams. A triple-beam balance was used in the laboratory.  Unless otherwise noted, measurements are expressed in millimeters and  weights are expressed in grams.    Body"]]]
