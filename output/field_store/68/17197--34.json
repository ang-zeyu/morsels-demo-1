The  larger had an antler spread of three feet eight inches, the smaller, that  of three feet. In the shock of the conflict, the horns of the younger had  fitted snugly into the many branches of the other set of antlers, and the  heads were as solidly and as perfectly fastened together as if bolted with  iron.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE, WITH CALVES, SWIMMING MUD POND.    (West Branch Waters.)]    That the fight had been long and stubborn the horns showed. Where they had  come together they had been rubbed and worn to the depth of half an inch.    The younger had died first, whether from exhaustion, or a broken neck, or  starvation, is not apparent, but the condition of the flesh when found  showed that he had lost the fight; and the victor did not long survive.  Fastened to his dead competitor he could not feed with this weight of four  hundred pounds attached to him, and must have succumbed to starvation. A  similar case is reported, and is thus described:--    \"No mortal eye witnessed what must have been a prolonged and fearful  contest; but when their bodies were found in the lake the story of what had  taken place was easily understood. The ground for some distance from the  lake was torn and trampled where the ferocious animals had charged upon  each other, and when the bodies were examined the antlers were found to be  so firmly interlocked that it was impossible to separate them. In order to  secure one good pair the finder sawed the other pair away, it not occurring  to him at the time that the interlocked antlers would be of considerably  more value than many pairs in the ordinary condition. In this instance it  was evident that the stronger had gone to his death because of his  strength. One of the two was much stronger than the other, and under  ordinary circumstances this would have secured him the victory. As it was,  the advantage was fatal. In rushing at each other, the antlers of the two  locked together, and it was then that the larger moose thought he had the  smaller one at his mercy. So he had, as far as the ability to push him  about and force him back was concerned, but when the larger animal forced  the smaller into the lake, both were indeed in a common peril and shared a  common fate.\"    Moose are not secured in a day. In fact, the greater majority of sportsmen  require several trips to the woods to assure them success. There are  exceptions to this rule, however.    I recall the case of a sportsman who went into the wilderness for a  two-weeks stay with his wife, and brought down a moose the first day out.  He had no thought of getting one when he started, but it being his wife's  birthday, he indulged in a dream and told her that she would be presented  with a pair of moose antlers by him for a birthday present. This naturally  pleased her ladyship, and her liege lord took his gun, his guide and canoe,  and started out to try to fulfil his promise.    [Illustration: SPIKE-HORN BULL SWIMMING MUD POND.    (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    When the canoe emerged from the stream into the pond the hunter and guide  were surprised enough to see, at the edge, in shallow water, a large bull  moose. The animal was up to his back feeding on the lily roots, splashing  his great head about, and having no fear, in his lonely retreat, of being  interrupted by hunters. The wind, being in the right direction, gave the  men an advantage, as the moose could not scent them. The guide approached  cautiously, never taking his paddle from the water as he propelled the  light craft along.    Suddenly the moose heard something, perhaps the gentle splash of water  against the canoe, that made him look around. For a second he gazed  silently at the two men sitting in the little craft, now scarcely a hundred  yards away. Then he swung his great body slowly around (as there was soft  mud on the pond bottom, and he could not make way swiftly in it) and  started for the bank. The hunter held his fire, fingering his gun-lock  nervously, until the moose had reached firm ground. It would not have done  to shoot him in the mire, for, the water being shallow, half a dozen men  could not have extracted the body; but with the first step the great beast  (with mud and water dripping from his body) took upon the shore, a bullet  pierced him in the neck. Then there was a succession of shots, and little  jets of blood spurted out on the dark brown coat of the forest giant, who  by this time was making rapid way along the rocky shore of the pond. A  dense cedar swamp lay inland from the shore, and into it the wounded moose  did not dare to plunge. He must retreat under fire, like a general with the  enemy on one side and a river on the other.    At last he disappeared in a thicket. The hunters had gone ashore and were  after him, coming up just as he sank to earth. A bullet behind the ear  discharged his debt to nature.    That night a noble head adorned the camp of the hunter, who had  unexpectedly made good a promise his wife never expected him to fulfil.    Contrast this experience with another I have in mind, and the two sides of  moose hunting will be illustrated. For three seasons a good hunter from a  Massachusetts town had gone into Maine to get a moose, and three times he  had returned home empty handed. He scorned to shoot deer. He hardly would  have brought down a bear had one presented himself to be shot. He wanted  moose. It was a hard country for hunting, a place of boulders and blowdowns  and stumps,--a desolate waste. He saw moose tracks, and he was there to  follow them, which he did long and wearily, for a day, and at night he  slept in an abandoned camp. Again on the next day he followed them, seeing  them sometimes on the soft, green moss, again at the side of a stream, or  in some boggy place. At times they were lost on a rocky slope, or in a  region of hard ground. There was no snow to aid the hunter, and the  tracking of moose in such a country without it called for the best traits  of the seasoned sportsman,--patience and endurance.    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE IN DEEP SNOW.    Taken during January, near Eagle Lake.    Photographed from Life.]    The trail led uphill at last, and after following it up the base of a  mountain, amid scrub growth and blowdowns, the hunter was rewarded by  seeing at long range a large bull. The moose scented the hunter almost as  soon as sighted, and stood not upon the order of his going but sought a  lower level. It was at this juncture that the resource of the experienced  hunter came in. He did not stand and watch the animal disappear. Not he!  Sending along a lead missile to announce his intentions, he set out in hot  pursuit. There began such a chase as hunters seldom engage in. The moose  had an advantage over the man, for he could take long leaps over  depressions in the ground, and over fallen trees and big rocks. The hunter  had to jump, run, slide, and bound along as best he could. He saw nothing  but the moose, and he saw him only as one sees an express train  disappearing in a fog. Whenever, by some change in the course of the  animal, or a favorable turn in the ground, a shot was offered, the hunter  fired; then he would pump another cartridge into the chamber of his rifle,  and resume the pace.    Thus tearing at break-neck speed down a rough mountain side, the sportsman,  followed by his puffing guide, gradually came up to the moose. The bullets  had taken effect, though not in a vital part, and the animal was weakening.  But moose and hunter plunged on, through woods and under brush that grew  at the bottom of the mountain, and at last, after what seemed a chase of a  dozen miles, but which in reality might have been three, the hunter came  into full sight of his anticipated prize in a clearing. This time the  animal was in a position for a telling shot, which was sped with good aim,  and brought the great beast to his knees. Another ended his career, and the  hunter, out of breath, sat down to wipe his brow. He had lost his hat and  mittens in the chase, his clothing was torn, and he was battered and  bruised. This counted for nothing. He had brought down his moose after four  seasons' work. It was necessary to \"swamp\" a road, that is, cut one through  the woods, for a mile to get the carcass to a logging road over which it  could be hauled to the river. As the first snow of the season fell that  night the moose was brought out and it was comparatively easy work to get  him to the railroad station on the next day.    One more moose story may not be amiss. It has to do with a party of  sportsmen, consisting of a judge and a banker, who went into a famous moose  country to try their luck. They fired but one round during their stay in  the woods, and with a guide brought down in that one volley three large  bull moose. The story is fully vouched for and the heads of two of the  bulls may now be seen in an Aroostook town.    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE ON BLACK POND. (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    These two hunters, like the first one mentioned, did not expect to find  moose. They thought luck might take a turn in their favor, but were ready  to sustain themselves in hope deferred if it did not.    The judge and the banker went into the woods from a little settlement on  the Aroostook River. They travelled a good sixty miles by horse-sled in the  snow before reaching the place where they were to engage guides. It was  another twenty-five miles to the camp where they put up on their first  night out, a \"depot\" camp, where lumber crews going in and out stopped to  rest and sleep.    On the morning after their arrival the two hunters set out in the snow with  their guide to look for moose signs. They walked half a dozen miles without  finding any, and, getting tired, went back to camp, leaving the guide to  pursue the quest, and let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#3)"],[1,"he wasn't. Besides people  don't nowadays choose proud heroes for governors. Anything but. They  prefer constitutional monarchs, who are paid servants and who know it.  That is democracy. Democracy admires its own servants and nothing else.  And you couldn't make a real servant even of Garibaldi. Only of His  Majesty King Victor Emmanuel. So Italy chose Victor Emmanuel, and  Garibaldi went off with a corn bag and a whack on the behind like a  humble ass.           *       *       *       *       *    It is raining--dismally, dismally raining. And this is Messina coming.  Oh horrible Messina, earthquake-shattered and renewing your youth like a  vast mining settlement, with rows and streets and miles of concrete  shanties, squalor and a big street with shops and gaps and broken houses  still, just back of the tram-lines, and a dreary squalid  earthquake-hopeless port in a lovely harbor. People don't forget and  don't recover. The people of Messina seem to be today what they were  nearly twenty years ago, after the earthquake: people who have had a  terrible shock, and for whom all life's institutions are really nothing,  neither civilization nor purpose. The meaning of everything all came  down with a smash in that shuddering earthquake, and nothing remains but  money and the throes of some sort of sensation. Messina between the  volcanoes, Etna and Stromboli, having known the death-agony's terror. I  always dread coming near the awful place, yet I have found the people  kind, almost feverishly so, as if they knew the awful need for kindness.           *       *       *       *       *    Raining, raining hard. Clambering down on to the wet platform and  walking across the wet lines to the cover. Many human beings scurrying  across the wet lines, among the wet trains, to get out into the ghastly  town beyond. Thank heaven one need not go out into the town. Two  convicts chained together among the crowd--and two soldiers. The  prisoners wear fawny homespun clothes, of cloth such as the peasants  weave, with irregularly occurring brown stripes. Rather nice handmade  rough stuff. But linked together, dear God! And those horrid caps on  their hairless foreheads. No hair. Probably they are going to a convict  station on the Lipari islands. The people take no notice.    No, but convicts are horrible creatures: at least, the old one is, with  his long, nasty face: his long, clean-shaven, horrible face, without  emotions, or with emotions one cannot follow. Something cold, sightless.  A sightless, ugly look. I should loathe to have to touch him. Of the  other I am not so sure. He is younger, and with dark eyebrows. But a  roundish, softish face, with a sort of leer. No, evil is horrible. I  used to think there was no absolute evil. Now I know there is a great  deal. So much that it threatens life altogether. That ghastly  abstractness of criminals. They don't _know_ any more what other people  feel. Yet some horrible force drives them.    It is a great mistake to abolish the death penalty. If I were dictator,  I should order the old one to be hung at once. I should have judges with  sensitive, living hearts: not abstract intellects. And because the  instinctive heart recognised a man as evil, I would have that man  destroyed. Quickly. Because good warm life is now in danger.           *       *       *       *       *    Standing on Messina station--dreary, dreary hole--and watching the  winter rain and seeing the pair of convicts, I must remember again Oscar  Wilde on Reading platform, a convict. What a terrible mistake, to let  oneself be martyred by a lot of canaille. A man must say his say. But  _noli me tangere_.    Curious these people are. Up and down, up and down go a pair of  officials. The young one in a black gold-laced cap talks to the elder in  a scarlet gold-laced cap. And he walks, the young one, with a mad little  hop, and his fingers fly as if he wanted to scatter them to the four  winds of heaven, and his words go off like fireworks, with more than  Sicilian speed. On and on, up and down, and his eye is dark and excited  and unseeing, like the eye of a fleeing rabbit. Strange and beside  itself is humanity.           *       *       *       *       *    What a lot of officials! You know them by their caps. Elegant tubby  little officials in kid-and-patent boots and gold-laced caps, tall  long-nosed ones in more gold-laced caps, like angels in and out of the  gates of heaven they thread in and out of the various doors. As far as I  can see, there are three scarlet station-masters, five black-and-gold  substation-masters, and a countless number of principalities and powers  in more or less broken boots and official caps. They are like bees round  a hive, humming in an important _conversazione_, and occasionally  looking at some paper or other, and extracting a little official honey.  But the _conversazione_ is the affair of affairs. To an Italian  official, life seems to be one long and animated conversation--the  Italian word is better--interrupted by casual trains and telephones. And  besides the angels of heaven's gates, there are the mere ministers,  porters, lamp-cleaners, etc. These stand in groups and talk socialism. A  lamp-man slashes along, swinging a couple of lamps. Bashes one against a  barrow. Smash goes the glass. Looks down as if to say, What do you mean  by it? Glances over his shoulder to see if any member of the higher  hierarchies is looking. Seven members of higher hierarchies are  assiduously not looking. On goes the minister with the lamp, blithely.  Another pane or two gone. _Vogue la galere._    Passengers have gathered again, some in hoods, some in nothing. Youths  in thin, paltry clothes stand out in the pouring rain as if they did not  know it was raining. One sees their coat-shoulders soaked. And yet they  do not trouble to keep under shelter. Two large station dogs run about  and trot through the standing trains, just like officials. They climb up  the footboard, hop into a train and hop out casually when they feel like  it. Two or three port-porters, in canvas hats as big as umbrellas,  literally, spreading like huge fins over their shoulders, are looking  into more empty trains. More and more people appear. More and more  official caps stand about. It rains and rains. The train for Palermo  and the train for Syracuse are both an hour late already, coming from  the port. Flea-bite. Though these are the great connections from Rome.    Loose locomotives trundle back and forth, vaguely, like black dogs  running and turning back. The port is only four minutes' walk. If it  were not raining so hard, we would go down, walk along the lines and get  into the waiting train down there. Anybody may please himself. There is  the funnel of the great unwieldy ferry-object--she is just edging in.  That means the connection from the mainland at last. But it is cold,  standing here. We eat a bit of bread and butter from the kitchenino in  resignation. After all, what is an hour and a half? It might just as  easily be five hours, as it was the last time we came down from Rome.  And the _wagon-lit_, booked to Syracuse, calmly left stranded in the  station of Messina, to go no further. All get out and find yourselves  rooms for the night in vile Messina. Syracuse or no Syracuse, Malta boat  or no Malta boat. We are the _Ferrovia dello Stato_.    But there, why grumble. Noi Italiani siamo cosi buoni. Take it from  their own mouth.           *       *       *       *       *    Ecco! Finalmente! The crowd is quite joyful as the two express trains  surge proudly in, after their half-a-mile creep. Plenty of room, for  once. Though the carriage floor is a puddle, and the roof leaks. This  is second class.           *       *       *       *       *    Slowly, with two engines, we grunt and chuff and twist to get over the  break-neck heights that shut Messina in from the north coast. The  windows are opaque with steam and drops of rain. No matter--tea from the  thermos flask, to the great interest of the other two passengers who had  nervously contemplated the unknown object.    \"Ha!\" says he with joy, seeing the hot tea come out. \"It has the  appearance of a bomb.\"    \"Beautiful hot!\" says she, with real admiration. All apprehension at  once dissipated, peace reigns in the wet, mist-hidden compartment. We  run through miles and miles of tunnel. The Italians have made wonderful  roads and railways.           *       *       *       *       *    If one rubs the window and looks out, lemon groves with many wet-white  lemons, earthquake-broken houses, new shanties, a grey weary sea on the  right hand, and on the left the dim, grey complication of steep heights  from which issue stone river-beds of inordinate width, and sometimes a  road, a man on a mule. Sometimes near at hand, long-haired, melancholy  goats leaning sideways like tilted ships under the eaves of some scabby  house. They call the house-eaves the dogs' umbrellas. In town you see  the dogs trotting close under the wall out of the wet. Here the goats  lean like rock, listing inwards to the plaster wall. Why look out?    Sicilian railways are all single line. Hence, the _coincidenza_. A  _coincidenza_ is where two trains meet in a loop. You sit in a world of  rain and waiting until some silly engine with four trucks puffs  alongside. Ecco la coincidenza! Then after a brief _conversazione_  between the two trains, _diretto_ and _merce_, express and goods, the  tin horn sounds and away we go, happily, towards the next coincidence.  Clerks away ahead joyfully chalk up our hours of lateness on the  announcement slate. All adds to the adventurous flavour of the journey,  dear heart. We come to a station where we find the other diretto, the  express from the other direction, awaiting our coincidential arrival.  The two trains run alongside one another, like two dogs meeting in the  street and snuffing one another. Every official rushes to"]]]
