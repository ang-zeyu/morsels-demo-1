[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#3)"],[1,"   grown up around it never quite died out. The book, and softcopies     obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from     MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing     influence on hacker language and humor. Even as the advent of the     microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of     hackerdom, the File (and related materials such as the [48]Some AI     Koans in Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a     hacker-culture Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of     the Knights of the Lab. The pace of change in hackerdom at large     accelerated tremendously -- but the Jargon File, having passed from     living document to icon, remained essentially untouched for seven     years.       This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of     jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after     careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merges in     about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and     a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also     obsolete.       This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim     is to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical     computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested. More     than half of the entries now derive from [49]Usenet and represent     jargon now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts     have been made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC     programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe     world.       Eric S. Raymond [50]<esr@snark.thyrsus.com> maintains the new File     with assistance from Guy L. Steele Jr. [51]<gls@think.com>; these are     the persons primarily reflected in the File's editorial `we', though     we take pleasure in acknowledging the special contribution of the     other coauthors of Steele-1983.

The 2.9.6 version became the main text of \"The New Hacker's     Dictionary\", by Eric Raymond (ed.), MIT Press 1991, ISBN     0-262-68069-6.       The 3.0.0 version was published in September 1993 as the second     edition of \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\", again from MIT Press (ISBN     0-262-18154-1).

The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the     Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to     make it available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of     the hacker community.       Here is a chronology of the high points in the recent on-line     revisions:       Version 2.1.1, Jun 12 1990: the Jargon File comes alive again after a     seven-year hiatus. Reorganization and massive additions were by Eric     S. Raymond, approved by Guy Steele. Many items of UNIX, C, USENET, and     microcomputer-based jargon were added at that time.

Major version 1 is reserved for the `old' (ITS)     Jargon File, jargon-1. Major version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR     (Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L. Steele, Jr.)     leading up to and including the second paper edition. From now on,     major version number N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper     edition. Usually later versions will either completely supersede or     incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no point in     keeping old versions around.       Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and     assistance, and to the hundreds of Usenetters (too many to name here)     who contributed entries and encouragement.

Here is the poem:        There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree.      He is singing to me! He is singing to me!      And what does he say--little girl, little boy?      \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!          Hush! Look! In my tree,          I am as happy as happy can be.\"        And the brown thrush keeps singing, \"A nest, do you see,      And five eggs, hid by me in the big cherry tree?      Don't meddle, don't touch--little girl, little boy--      Or the world will lose some of its joy!          Now I am glad! now I am free!          And I always shall be,          If you never bring sorrow to me.\"        So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree      To you and to me--to you and to me;      And he sings all the day--little girl, little boy--      \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!          But long it won't be,          Don't you know? don't you see?          Unless we're good as good can be.\"    [Illustration: BROWN THRASHER.]          [Illustration: JAPAN PHEASANT.]    THE JAPAN PHEASANT.      Originally the Pheasant was an inhabitant of Asia Minor but has been  by degrees introduced into many countries, where its beauty of form,  plumage, and the delicacy of its flesh made it a welcome visitor. The  Japan Pheasant is a very beautiful species, about which little is known  in its wild state, but in captivity it is pugnacious. It requires much  shelter and plenty of food, and the breed is to some degree artificially  kept up by the hatching of eggs under domestic hens and feeding them in  the coop like ordinary chickens, until they are old and strong enough to  get their own living.    The food of this bird is extremely varied. When young it is generally  fed on ants' eggs, maggots, grits, and similar food, but when it is full  grown it is possessed of an accommodating appetite and will eat many  kinds of seeds, roots, and leaves. It will also eat beans, peas, acorns,  berries, and has even been known to eat the ivy leaf, as well as the  berry.    This Pheasant loves the ground, runs with great speed, and always  prefers to trust to its legs rather than to its wings. It is crafty, and  when alarmed it slips quickly out of sight behind a bush or through a  hedge, and then runs away with astonishing rapidity, always remaining  under cover until it reaches some spot where it deems itself safe. The  male is not domestic, passing an independent life during a part of the  year and associating with others of its own sex during the rest of the  season.    The nest is very rude, being merely a heap of leaves and grass on the  ground, with a very slight depression. The eggs are numerous, about  eleven or twelve, and olive brown in color. In total length, though they  vary considerably, the full grown male is about three feet. The female  is smaller in size than her mate, and her length a foot less.    The Japan Pheasant is not a particularly interesting bird aside from his  beauty, which is indeed brilliant, there being few of the species more  attractive.          THE FLICKER.      A great variety of names does this bird possess. It is commonly known  as the Golden Winged Woodpecker, Yellow-shafted Flicker, Yellow Hammer,  and less often as High-hole or High-holer, Wake-up, etc. In suitable  localities throughout the United States and the southern parts of  Canada, the Flicker is a very common bird, and few species are more  generally known. \"It is one of the most sociable of our Woodpeckers,  and is apparently always on good terms with its neighbors. It usually  arrives in April, occasionally even in March, the males preceding the  females a few days, and as soon as the latter appear one can hear their  voices in all directions.\"    The Flicker is an ardent wooer. It is an exceedingly interesting and  amusing sight to see a couple of males paying their addresses to a coy  and coquettish female; the apparent shyness of the suitors as they sidle  up to her and as quickly retreat again, the shy glances given as one  peeps from behind a limb watching the other--playing bo-peep--seem  very human, and \"I have seen,\" says an observer, \"few more amusing  performances than the courtship of a pair of these birds.\" The defeated  suitor takes his rejection quite philosophically, and retreats in a  dignified manner, probably to make other trials elsewhere. Few birds  deserve our good will more than the Flicker. He is exceedingly useful,  destroying multitudes of grubs, larvae, and worms. He loves berries and  fruit but the damage he does to cultivated fruit is very trifling.    The Flicker begins to build its nest about two weeks after the bird  arrives from the south. It prefers open country, interspersed with  groves and orchards, to nest in. Any old stump, or partly decayed limb  of a tree, along the banks of a creek, beside a country road, or in  an old orchard, will answer the purpose. Soft wood trees seem to be  preferred, however. In the prairie states it occasionally selects  strange nesting sites. It has been known to chisel through the weather  boarding of a dwelling house, barns, and other buildings, and to nest  in the hollow space between this and the cross beams; its nests have  also been found in gate posts, in church towers, and in burrows of  Kingfishers and bank swallows, in perpendicular banks of streams. One  of the most peculiar sites of his selection is described by William A.  Bryant as follows: \"On a small hill, a quarter of a mile distant from  any home, stood a hay stack which had been placed there two years  previously. The owner, during the winter of 1889-90, had cut the stack  through the middle and hauled away one portion, leaving the other  standing, with the end smoothly trimmed. The following spring I noticed  a pair of flickers about the stack showing signs of wanting to make it  a fixed habitation. One morning a few days later I was amused at the  efforts of one of the pair. It was clinging to the perpendicular end of  the stack and throwing out clipped hay at a rate to defy competition.  This work continued for a week, and in that time the pair had excavated  a cavity twenty inches in depth. They remained in the vicinity until  autumn. During the winter the remainder of the stack was removed. They  returned the following spring, and, after a brief sojourn, departed for  parts unknown.\"    From five to nine eggs are generally laid. They are glossy white in  color, and when fresh appear as if enameled.    The young are able to leave the nest in about sixteen days; they crawl  about on the limbs of the tree for a couple of days before they venture  to fly, and return to the nest at night.    [Illustration: FLICKER.]          THE BOBOLINK.          \"When Nature had made all her birds,      And had no cares to think on,      She gave a rippling laugh,      And out there flew a Bobolinkon.\"    No American ornithologist omits mention of the Bobolink, and naturalists  generally have described him under one of the many names by which he is  known. In some States he is called the Rice Bird, in others Reed Bird,  the Rice or Reed Bunting, while his more familiar title, throughout the  greater part of America, is Bobolink, or Bobolinkum. In Jamaica, where  he gets very fat during his winter stay, he is called the Butter Bird.  His title of Rice Troopial is earned by the depredations which he  annually makes upon the rice crops, though his food \"is by no means  restricted to that seed, but consists in a large degree of insects,  grubs, and various wild grasses.\" A migratory bird, residing during the  winter in the southern parts of America, he returns in vast multitudes  northward in the early Spring. According to Wilson, their course of  migration is as follows: \"In April, or very early in May, the Rice  Buntings, male and female, arrive within the southern boundaries of  the United States, and are seen around the town of Savannah, Georgia,  sometimes in separate parties of males and females, but more generally  promiscuously. They remain there but a short time, and about the middle  of May make their appearance in the lower part of Pennsylvania. While  here the males are extremely gay and full of song, frequenting meadows,  newly plowed fields, sides of creeks, rivers, and watery places, feeding  on May flies and caterpillars, of which they destroy great quantities.  In their passage, however, through Virginia at this season, they do  great damage to the early wheat and barley while in their milky state.  About the 20th of May they disappear on their way to the North. Nearly  at the same time they arrive in the State of New York, spread over the  whole of the New England States, as far as the river St. Lawrence, and  from Lake Ontario to the sea. In all of these places they remain during  the Summer, building their nests and rearing their young.\"    The Bobolink's song is a peculiar one, varying greatly with the  occasion. As he flys southward, his cry is a kind of clinking note; but  the love song addressed to his mate is voluble and fervent. It has been  said that if you should strike the keys of a pianoforte haphazard, the  higher and the lower singly very quickly, you might have some idea of  the Bobolink's notes. In the month of June he gradually changes his  pretty, attractive dress and puts on one very like the females, which is  of a plain rusty brown, and is not reassumed until the next season of  nesting. The two parent birds in the plate represent the change from the  dark plumage in which the bird is commonly known in the North as the  Bobolink, to the dress of yellowish brown by which it is known  throughout the South as the Rice or Reed Bird.    His nest, small and a plain one, too, is built on the ground by his  industrious little wife. The inside is warmly lined with soft fibers of  whatever may be nearest at hand. Five pretty white eggs, spotted all  over with brown are laid, and as soon        \"As the little ones chip the shell     "]]]
