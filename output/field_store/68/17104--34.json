Now, however, there is no doubt. The Civilization which  has been pictured as developing peacefully upon all the teeming planets  of two galaxies will not now of itself come into being. We of Arisia  should be able to bring it eventually to full fruition, but the task  will be long and difficult.    \"The Eddorians' minds are of tremendous latent power. Were they to know  of us now, it is practically certain that they would be able to develop  powers and mechanisms by the use of which they would negate our every  effort--they would hurl us out of this, our native space and time. We  must have time ... given time, we shall succeed. There shall be Lenses  ... and entities of Civilization worthy in every respect to wear them.  But we of Arisia alone will never be able to conquer the Eddorians.  Indeed, while this is not yet certain, the probability is exceedingly  great that despite our utmost efforts at self-development our  descendants will have to breed, from some people to evolve upon a planet  not yet in existence, an entirely new race--a race tremendously more  capable than ours--to succeed us as Guardians of Civilization.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Centuries passed. Millenia. Cosmic and geologic ages. Planets cooled to  solidity and stability. Life formed and grew and developed. And as life  evolved it was subjected to, and strongly if subtly affected by, the  diametrically opposed forces of Arisia and Eddore._          CHAPTER 2    THE FALL OF ATLANTIS    1. EDDORE      \"Members of the Innermost Circle, wherever you are and whatever you may  be doing, tune in!\" the All-Highest broadcast. \"Analysis of the data  furnished by the survey just completed shows that in general the Great  Plan is progressing satisfactorily. There seem to be only four planets  which our delegates have not been or may not be able to control  properly: Sol III, Rigel IV, Velantia III, and Palain VII. All four, you  will observe, are in the other galaxy. No trouble whatever has developed  in our own.    \"Of these four, the first requires drastic and immediate personal  attention. Its people, in the brief interval since our previous general  survey, have developed nuclear energy and have fallen into a cultural  pattern which does not conform in any respect to the basic principles  laid down by us long since. Our deputies there, thinking erroneously  that they could handle matters without reporting fully to or calling for  help upon the next higher operating echelon, must be disciplined  sharply. Failure, from whatever cause, can not be tolerated.    \"Gharlane, as Master Number Two, you will assume control of Sol III  immediately. This Circle now authorizes and instructs you to take  whatever steps may prove necessary to restore order upon that planet.  Examine carefully this data concerning the other three worlds which may  very shortly become troublesome. Is it your thought that one or more  others of this Circle should be assigned to work with you, to be sure  that these untoward developments are suppressed?\"    \"It is not, Your Supremacy,\" that worthy decided, after a time of study.  \"Since the peoples in question are as yet of low intelligence; since one  form of flesh at a time is all that will have to be energized; and since  the techniques will be essentially similar; I can handle all four more  efficiently alone than with the help or cooperation of others. If I read  this data correctly, there will be need of only the most elementary  precaution in the employment of mental force, since of the four races,  only the Velantians have even a rudimentary knowledge of its uses.  Right?\"    \"We so read the data.\" Surprisingly enough, the Innermost Circle agreed  unanimously.    \"Go, then. When finished, report in full.\"    \"I go, All-Highest. I shall render a complete and conclusive report.\"      2. ARISIA    \"We, the Elder Thinkers in fusion, are spreading in public view, for  study and full discussion, a visualization of the relationships existing  and to exist between Civilization and its irreconcilable and implacable  foe. Several of our younger members, particularly Eukonidor, who has  just attained Watchmanship, have requested instruction in this matter.  Being as yet immature, their visualizations do not show clearly why  Nedanillor, Kriedigan, Drounli, and Brolenteen, either singly or in  fusion, have in the past performed certain acts and have not performed  certain others; or that the future actions of those Moulders of  Civilization will be similarly constrained.    \"This visualization, while more complex, more complete, and more  detailed than the one set up by our forefathers at the time of the  Coalescence, agrees with it in every essential. The five basics remain  unchanged. First: the Eddorians can be overcome only by mental force.  Second: the magnitude of the required force is such that its only  possible generator is such an organization as the Galactic Patrol toward  which we have been and are working. Third: since no Arisian or any  fusion of Arisians will ever be able to spear-head that force, it was  and is necessary to develop a race of mentality sufficient to perform  that task. Fourth: this new race, having been instrumental in removing  the menace of Eddore, will as a matter of course displace the Arisians  as Guardians of Civilization. Fifth: the Eddorians must not become  informed of us until such a time as it will be physically,  mathematically impossible for them to construct any effective  counter-devices.\"    \"A cheerless outlook, truly,\" came a somber thought.    \"Not so, daughter. A little reflection will show you that your present  thinking is loose and turbid. When that time comes, every Arisian will  be ready for the change. We know the way. We do not know to what that  way leads; but the Arisian purpose in this phase of existence--this  space-time continuum--will have been fulfilled and we will go eagerly  and joyfully on to the next. Are there any more questions?\"    There were none.    \"Study this material, then, each of you, with exceeding care. It may be  that some one of you, even a child, will perceive some facet of the  truth which we have missed or have not examined fully; some fact or  implication which may be made to operate to shorten the time of conflict  or to lessen the number of budding Civilizations whose destruction seems  to us at present to be sheerly unavoidable.\"    Hours passed. Days. No criticisms or suggestions were offered.    \"We take it, then, that this visualization is the fullest and most  accurate one possible for the massed intellect of Arisia to construct  from the information available at the moment. The Moulders therefore,  after describing briefly what they have already done, will inform us as  to what they deem it necessary to do in the near future.\"    \"We have observed, and at times have guided, the evolution of  intelligent life upon many planets,\" the fusion began. \"We have, to the  best of our ability, directed the energies of these entities into the  channels of Civilization; we have adhered consistently to the policy of  steering as many different races as possible toward the intellectual  level necessary for the effective use of the Lens, without which the  proposed Galactic Patrol cannot come into being.    \"For many cycles of time we have been working as individuals with the  four strongest races, from one of which will be developed the people who  will one day replace us as Guardians of Civilization. Blood lines have  been established. We have encouraged matings which concentrate traits  of strength and dissipate those of weakness. While no very great  departure from the norm, either physically or mentally, will take place  until after the penultimates have been allowed to meet and to mate, a  definite general improvement of each race has been unavoidable.    \"Thus the Eddorians have already interested themselves in our budding  Civilization upon the planet Tellus, and it is inevitable that they will  very shortly interfere with our work upon the other three. These four  young Civilizations must be allowed to fall. It is to warn every Arisian  against well-meant but inconsidered action that this conference was  called. We ourselves will operate through forms of flesh of no higher  intelligence than, and indistinguishable from, the natives of the  planets affected. No traceable connection will exist between those forms  and us. No other Arisians will operate within extreme range of any one  of those four planets; they will from now on be given the same status as  has been so long accorded Eddore itself. The Eddorians must not learn of  us until after it is too late for them to act effectively upon that  knowledge. Any chance bit of information obtained by any Eddorian must  be obliterated at once. It is to guard against and to negate such  accidental disclosures that our Watchmen have been trained.\"    \"But if all of our Civilizations go down....\" Eukonidor began to  protest.    \"Study will show you, youth, that the general level of mind, and hence  of strength, is rising,\" the fused Elders interrupted. \"The trend is  ever upward; each peak and valley being higher than its predecessor.  When the indicated level has been reached--the level at which the  efficient use of the Lens will become possible--we will not only allow  ourselves to become known to them; we will engage them at every point.\"    \"One factor remains obscure.\" A Thinker broke the ensuing silence. \"In  this visualization I do not perceive anything to preclude the  possibility that the Eddorians may at any time visualize us. Granted  that the Elders of long ago did not merely visualize the Eddorians, but  perceived them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32817"],[0,"A New Tortoise, Genus Gopherus, From North-central Mexico (#3)"],[1,"above, or the reference of Duges      (_loc. cit._) to large size, since they are based on second or      third-hand accounts, would seem to be unrealistic and of little      scientific value when considered alone and at face value. However,      in the light of the discovery of _Gopherus flavomarginatus_, these      accounts have new meaning and tend to support my proposal that the      species is the largest tortoise in North America.        _Remarks._--The paratypes at the University of Illinois were found      in a trash-dump in Carrillo. According to what the collectors      learned from local inhabitants, the species is used for food and      the shells are sometimes used for poultry dishes or even for eating      utensils. Although the species is found on the flat, sandy desert      near Carrillo, it is more common on the nearby mountain slopes and      is seen there most frequently after rains. Dickerman (field notes,      1954) likewise noted that the species was eaten near Americanos;      the K.U. paratype represents the best (and only specimen saved) of      several broken shells found in that area. Judging by the habits of      other members of the genus and by the notes of Duges (1888:147),      _G. flavomarginatus_ is probably herbivorous.        _Acknowledgments._--A portion of this study was completed in the      summer of 1958, while I was an internee at the United States      National Museum. I am grateful to Dr. Doris M. Cochran of that      institution for helpful information regarding the origin of the      type and for permission to study other specimens in her care.      Thanks are due also to Messrs. Pete S. Chrapliwy and Kenneth L.      Williams who collected two of the paratypes and who generously      provided their notes on the specimens when learning of my study, to      Dr. Hobart M. Smith and Mr. Charles M. Bogert for offering helpful      suggestions and for the loan of specimens, and to Mr. Jebb Taylor      for assistance with taking data.
