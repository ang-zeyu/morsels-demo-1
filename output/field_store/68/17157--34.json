It was  then that a bold captain conceived the apparently insane project of  setting out with a few hundred men to conquer what passed for the  richest and most powerful of these empires. His success demanded not  only all his courage, but all his cold cruelty and absolute  unscrupulousness, together with those favours which fortune sometimes  reserves for audacity. At any rate he succeeded, and the rumours that  had inflamed his imagination turned out to be true. On his way he came  upon great cities, upon admirably cultivated lands, upon a complete  social and military organization. He saw an unknown religion display  itself before his eyes. There were temples, sacrifices, magnificent  ceremonies. There were priests, there were convents, there were monks  and nuns. To his profound amazement, he noticed the cross carved upon a  great number of religious edifices, and saw a goddess who bore her  infant in her arms. The natives had rites which closely recalled the  Christian baptism and the Christian communion. As for our captain,  neither he nor his contemporaries could see anything in all this parade  of a religion, now so closely approaching, now so utterly remote, from  their own, but a gigantic ruse of the devil, who had led these unhappy  natives astray in order to secure their worship. But for us, who know  that the devil cannot help us to the genesis of ancient mythologies and  ancient religions--who know likewise that the social and religious  development of Central America was in the strictest sense native and  original, and that all attempts to bring it into connection with a  supposed earlier intercourse with Asia or Europe have failed--the  question presents itself under a very different aspect. In our Old  World, the natural religious development of man has produced myths and  mythologies, sacrificial rites and priesthoods, temples, ascetics, gods  and goddesses; and on the basis of the Old World's experience we might  already feel entitled to say, \"Such are the steps and stages of  religious evolution; such were the processes of the human spirit before  the appearance of the higher religions which are in some sort grafted  upon their elder sisters, and have in their turn absorbed or  spiritualized them.\" But there would still be room to ask whether all  this development had been natural and spontaneous, whether successive  imitations linking one contiguous people to another had not transformed  some local and isolated phenomenon into an apparently general and  international fact--much as took place with the use of tea or  cotton--without our being compelled to recognize any necessary law of  human development in it. But what answer is possible to the argument  furnished by the discovery of the new planet--I mean to say of America?  How can we resist this evidence that the whole organism of mythologies,  gods, goddesses, sacrifices, temples and priesthoods, while varying  enormously from race to race and from nation to nation, yet, wherever  human beings are found, develops itself under the same laws, the same  principles and the same methods of deduction; that, in a word, given  human nature anywhere, its religious development is reared on the same  identical bases and passes through the same phases?    Mr. Max Mueller, one of my most honoured masters, and one of those who  have best deserved the gratitude of the learned world, has declared,  with equal justice and penetration, in his Preface to Mr. Wyatt Gill's  \"Myths and Songs,\" that the possibility of studying the Polynesian  mythology is to the historian what an opportunity of spending a time in  the midst of the plesiosauri and the megatherions would be to the  zoologist, or of walking in the shade of the vast arborescent ferns that  lie buried under our present soil to the botanist. Polynesian mythology  has in fact preserved, down to our own day, the pre-historic ages. And,  similarly, the religions of Mexico and Peru (for the empire of the Incas  held the same surprises and the same lessons in store for its explorers  as that of Montezuma had done) has enabled history to carry to the  point of demonstration its fundamental thesis of the natural  development, in subjection to fixed laws, of the religious tendency in  man. All those curious resemblances, amidst the differences which we  shall also bring out, between the religious history of the New World and  that of the Old, are not at bottom any more extraordinary than the fact  that, in spite of the differences of physical type which separated the  natives from their conquerors, they none the less saw with eyes, walked  on feet, ate with a mouth and digested with a stomach.           *       *       *       *       *    We shall begin our study with Mexico. But a few preliminary  ethnographical remarks are indispensable. I spare you the catalogue of  the numerous sources and documents from which a detailed knowledge of  the Mexican religion may be drawn.[1] Such a list is in place in a book  rather than in a lecture. I will only direct your attention to the noble  collection made in 1830 by one of your own compatriots, Lord  Kingsborough, under the title of \"Antiquities of Mexico,\" a work of  extreme importance, which reproduces, in facsimile or engravings, the  monuments and ruins of ancient Mexico;[2] and the very remarkable work  of Mr. H. H. Bancroft, \"Native Races of the Pacific States of North  America.\"[3]      II.    The region with which we are now to occupy ourselves comprises the space  bounded on the South by the Isthmus of Panama, washed East and West by  the oceans, and determined, roughly speaking, towards the North by a  line starting from the head of the Gulf of California, and sweeping  round to the mouths of the Mississippi with a curve that takes in  Arizona and Southern Texas. In our day, this southern portion of North  America is broken into two great divisions, the first and most southern  of which is known collectively as Central America, and embraces the  republics of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, San Salvador  and Panama. The great peninsula of Yucatan, which is now Mexican,  formerly belonged to this group of Central American peoples. The second  portion of the territory we are to study corresponds to the present  republic of Mexico. I shall presently explain the sense in which it  might be called the Mexican empire in the time of Fernando Cortes. For  the present, let me ask you to remember that we are now about to speak,  in a general and preliminary manner, of the region which pretty closely  corresponds to the present Central America and Mexico.    To begin with, we treat these two districts as a single whole, because  the Europeans found them inhabited by a race which was divided, it is  true, into several varieties, but was distinguished clearly from the  Red-skins on the North, and still more from the Eskimos, and alone of  the native races of North America had proved itself capable of rising by  its own strength to a veritable civilization. The general physical type  of the race is marked by a very brown skin, a medium stature, low brow,  black coarse hair, prominent jaw, heavy lips, thick eyebrows, and a  nose generally large and often hooked. The noble families as a rule had  a clearer complexion. The women are thick-set and squab, but not without  grace in their movements. In their youth they are sometimes very pretty,  but they fade early. We must leave it to ethnological specialists to  decide whether this type is not the result of previous crossings.    So much is certain, that at an epoch the date of which it is impossible  to fix, but which must have been remote, this race, cut off from all the  world by the sea and the profoundest savagery, developed a civilization  _sui generis_, to which the traditional reminiscences of the natives  and a series of most remarkable ruins, discovered especially in Central  America, bear witness. For it is in this southern district that we find  the monumental ruins of Palenque, of Chiapa, of Uxmal, of Utatlan, and  of other places, the list of which has again begun to receive additions  in recent years. When the Spaniards conquered the New World, the centre  of this civilization had shifted further north, to Mexico proper, to the  city of Mexico, to Tezcuco and to Cholula. But the consciousness that  the Mexican civilization was affiliated to that of the isthmic region  had by no means been lost. It was a nation or race called Maya, the name  of which seems to indicate that it considered itself indigenous, and the  proper centre of which lay in Yucatan, that produced this American  civilization--capable of organizing states and priesthoods, of rearing  immense palaces, of carving stone in great perfection and with a true  artistic sense, and of realizing a high degree of physical well-being.  There is reason to believe, however, that this civilization, resembling  in some respects that of ancient Canaan, had more refinement in its  pursuit of material comfort than vigour in its morality. A certain  effeminacy, and even the endemic practice of odious vices, appears to  have early enervated it. When the Spaniards arrived in America, wars and  devastating invasions had shattered the old and powerful monarchies of  the central region and reduced the great monuments of antiquity to  ruins, and that too so long ago that the natives themselves, while  retaining a certain civilization, had lost all memory of the ancient  cities and the ancient palaces that the Europeans rescued from oblivion.  We may still see figured amongst the monuments of Mexico those beautiful  ruins of Palenque, where stretches a superb gallery,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#3)"],[1,"measure the angle thus marked. The student who has  studied elementary geometry should be able to demonstrate that at the  mean of the two recorded times the sun's altitude was equal to one half  of the angle measured in the figure.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Taking the sun's altitude.]    When the board is turned edgewise toward the sun so that its shadow is  as thin as possible, rule a pencil line alongside it on the horizon  plane. The angle which this line makes with a line pointing due south is  called the sun's _azimuth_. When the sun is south, its azimuth is zero;  when west, it is 90°; when east, 270°, etc.    EXERCISE 5.--Let a number of different students take the sun's altitude  during both the morning and afternoon session and note the time of each  observation, to the nearest minute. Verify the setting of the plane of  the horizon from time to time, to make sure that no change has occurred  in it.    6. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS.--Make a graph (drawing) of all the  observations, similar to Fig. 5, and find by bisecting a set of chords  _g_ to _g_, _e_ to _e_, _d_ to _d_, drawn parallel to _B B_, the time at  which the sun's altitude was greatest. In Fig. 5 we see from the  intersection of _M M_ with _B B_ that this time was 11h. 50m.    The method of graphs which is here introduced is of great importance in  physical science, and the student should carefully observe in Fig. 5  that the line _B B_ is a scale of times, which may be made long or  short, provided only the intervals between consecutive hours 9 to 10, 10  to 11, 11 to 12, etc., are equal. The distance of each little circle  from _B B_ is taken proportional to the sun's altitude, and may be upon  any desired scale--e. g., a millimeter to a degree--provided the same  scale is used for all observations. Each circle is placed accurately  over that part of the base line which corresponds to the time at which  the altitude was taken. Square ruled paper is very convenient, although  not necessary, for such diagrams. It is especially to be noted that from  the few observations which are represented in the figure a smooth curve  has been drawn through the circles which represent the sun's altitude,  and this curve shows the altitude of the sun at every moment between 9  A. M. and 3 P. M. In Fig. 5 the sun's altitude at noon was 57°. What was  it at half past two?    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--A graph of the sun's altitude.]    7. DIAMETER OF A DISTANT OBJECT.--By sighting over a protractor, measure  the angle between imaginary lines drawn from it to the opposite sides of  a window. Carry the protractor farther away from the window and repeat  the experiment, to see how much the angle changes. The angle thus  measured is called \"the angle subtended\" by the window at the place  where the measurement was made. If this place was squarely in front of  the window we may draw upon paper an angle equal to the measured one and  lay off from the vertex along its sides a distance proportional to the  distance of the window--e. g., a millimeter for each centimeter of real  distance. If a cross line be now drawn connecting the points thus found,  its length will be proportional to the width of the window, and the  width may be read off to scale, a centimeter for every millimeter in the  length of the cross line.    The astronomer who measures with an appropriate instrument the angle  subtended by the moon may in an entirely similar manner find the moon's  diameter and has, in fact, found it to be 2,163 miles. Can the same  method be used to find the diameter of the sun? A planet? The earth?          CHAPTER II    THE STARS AND THEIR DIURNAL MOTION      8. THE STARS.--From the very beginning of his study in astronomy, and as  frequently as possible, the student should practice watching the stars  by night, to become acquainted with the constellations and their  movements. As an introduction to this study he may face toward the  north, and compare the stars which he sees in that part of the sky with  the map of the northern heavens, given on Plate I, opposite page 124.  Turn the map around, upside down if necessary, until the stars upon it  match the brighter ones in the sky. Note how the stars are grouped in  such conspicuous constellations as the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the  Little Dipper (Ursa Minor), and Cassiopeia. These three constellations  should be learned so that they can be recognized at any time.    _The names of the stars._--Facing the star map is a key which contains  the names of the more important constellations and the names of the  brighter stars in their constellations. These names are for the most  part a Greek letter prefixed to the genitive case of the Latin name of  the constellation. (See the Greek alphabet printed at the end of the  book.)    9. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS.--Nearly nineteen centuries ago St. Paul  noted that \"one star differeth from another star in glory,\" and no more  apt words can be found to mark the difference of brightness which the  stars present. Even prior to St. Paul's day the ancient Greek  astronomers had divided the stars in respect of brightness into six  groups, which the modern astronomers still use, calling each group a  _magnitude_. Thus a few of the brightest stars are said to be of the  first magnitude, the great mass of faint ones which are just visible to  the unaided eye are said to be of the sixth magnitude, and intermediate  degrees of brilliancy are represented by the intermediate magnitudes,  second, third, fourth, and fifth. The student must not be misled by the  word magnitude. It has no reference to the size of the stars, but only  to their brightness, and on the star maps of this book the larger and  smaller circles by which the stars are represented indicate only the  brightness of the stars according to the system of magnitudes. Following  the indications of these maps, the student should, in learning the  principal stars and constellations, learn also to recognize how bright  is a star of the second, fourth, or other magnitude.    10. OBSERVING THE STARS.--Find on the map and in the sky the stars  [a] Ursæ Minoris, [a] Ursæ Majoris, [b] Ursæ Majoris. What geometrical  figure will fit on to these stars? In addition to its regular name,  [a] Ursæ Minoris is frequently called by the special name Polaris, or  the pole star. Why are the other two stars called \"the Pointers\"? What  letter of the alphabet do the five bright stars in Cassiopeia suggest?    EXERCISE 6.--Stand in such a position that Polaris is just hidden behind  the corner of a building or some other vertical line, and mark upon the  key map as accurately as possible the position of this line with respect  to the other stars, showing which stars are to the right and which are  to the left of it. Record the time (date, hour, and minute) at which  this observation was made. An hour or two later repeat the observation  at the same place, draw the line and note the time, and you will find  that the line last drawn upon the map does not agree with the first one.  The stars have changed their positions, and with respect to the vertical  line the Pointers are now in a different direction from Polaris.  Measure with a protractor the angle between the two lines drawn in the  map, and use this angle and the recorded times of the observation to  find how many degrees per hour this direction is changing. It should be  about 15° per hour. If the observation were repeated 12 hours after the  first recorded time, what would be the position of the vertical line  among the stars? What would it be 24 hours later? A week later? Repeat  the observation on the next clear night, and allowing for the number of  whole revolutions made by the stars between the two dates, again  determine from the time interval a more accurate value of the rate at  which the stars move.    The motion of the stars which the student has here detected is called  their \"diurnal\" motion. What is the significance of the word diurnal?    In the preceding paragraph there is introduced a method of great  importance in astronomical practice--i. e., determining something--in  this case the rate per hour, from observations separated by a long  interval of time, in order to get a more accurate value than could be  found from a short interval. Why is it more accurate? To determine the  rate at which the planet Mars rotates about its axis, astronomers use  observations separated by an interval of more than 200 years, during  which the planet made more than 75,000 revolutions upon its axis. If we  were to write out in algebraic form an equation for determining the  length of one revolution of Mars about its axis, the large number,  75,000, would appear in the equation as a divisor, and in the final  result would greatly reduce whatever errors existed in the observations  employed.    Repeat Exercise 6 night after night, and note whether the stars come  back to the same position at the same hour and minute every night.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. The plumb-line apparatus.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7. The plumb-line apparatus.]    11. THE PLUMB-LINE APPARATUS.--This experiment, and many others, may be  conveniently and accurately made with no other apparatus than a plumb  line, and a device for sighting past it. In Figs. 6 and 7 there is  shown a simple form of such apparatus, consisting essentially of a board  which rests in a horizontal position upon the points of three screws  that pass through it. This board carries a small box, to one side of  which is nailed in vertical position another board 5 or 6 feet long to  carry the plumb line. This consists of a wire or fish line with any  heavy weight--e. g., a brick or flatiron--tied to its lower end and  immersed in a vessel of water placed inside the box, so as to check any  swinging motion of the weight. In the cover of the box is a small hole  through which the wire passes, and by turning the screws in the  baseboard the apparatus may"]]]
