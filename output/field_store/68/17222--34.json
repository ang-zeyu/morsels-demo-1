They fatten easily, however, and arrive soon at maturity, though  reckoned inferior in these respects to the Cheviot variety.    (12.) _The South Down_, like the Ryeland, are, from the delicacy of  their constitution, unadapted for bleak situations, but sufficiently  hardy and active for a low country; their average weight is from 15  lbs. to 18 lbs. a-quarter; that of the fleece, which is very short and  fine, being from 2-1/2 lbs. to 3 lbs. They are without horns, have  grey faces and legs, a neck low set and small, and a breast neither  wide nor deep; their mutton is fine in the grain, and of an excellent  flavour, having been brought to great perfection by Mr Ellman of  Glynd, and other intelligent breeders. They are mostly found in  Sussex, on dry chalky downs producing short fine herbage, and arrive  early at maturity; in which respect they are equal to the Cheviot,  though inferior to them in quantity of tallow. Formerly they would not  take on fat till four years old; now they are always at market when  about two years of age, and many are killed before that period. Fig.  2. Pl. II.    (13.) _The Cheviot Sheep_ have a bare head, with a long jaw, and white  face, but no horns. Sometimes they have a shade of grey upon the nose,  approaching to dark at the tip; at others, a tinge of lemon colour on  the face, but these markings scarcely affect their value. The legs are  clean, long, and small-boned, and covered with wool to the hough; but  there is a sad want of depth at the breast, and of breadth both there  and on the chine. A fat carcass weighs from 12 lbs. to 18 lbs. per  quarter, and a medium fleece about 3 lbs. The purest specimens of this  breed are to be found on the Scotch side of the Cheviot hills, and on  the high and stony mountain-farms which lie between that range and the  source of the Teviot. These sheep are a capital mountain stock,  provided the pasture resembles the Cheviot hills, in containing a good  proportion of rich herbage. Fig. 2. Pl. III.    (14.) _Mugg Sheep._--\"In this variety,\" says Dr Fleming, in his  History of British Animals, \"the face and legs are white, or rarely  spotted with yellow, and the forehead covered with long wool. This is  the native breed in Scotland, to the north of the Forth and Clyde.  They are of small size, and seldom weigh above 8 or 10 lbs. per  quarter. Some tribes have horns; others are destitute of them, and  they vary in the length of the tail. They may be considered as the  stock of the numerous modern and valuable varieties, which are bred in  the best cultivated districts. The Shetland sheep belongs to this  kind. The fur consists of firm wool next the skin, with long coarse  hairs, indications of an inhabitant of an arctic climate.\"    (15.) _The Black-faced or Heath Sheep_ are known by their large spiral  horns, wild-looking eyes, black legs and faces, with short firm  carcasses, covered by long coarse wool, which weighs from 3 lbs. to 4  lbs. As the form of this sheep has lately been much improved, by  inducing a short and round carcass, they have acquired the name of  _short_ sheep, in contradistinction to the Cheviots, which are termed  long sheep. When three years old, they fatten well, affording  excellent highly-flavoured mutton, and weighing from 10 lbs. to 16  lbs. a-quarter. They are the most valuable upland sheep in Britain,  abounding in all the western counties of England and Scotland, and are  now becoming great favourites in the London market. Fig. 1. Pl. IV.    (16.) _The Merino._--Though many foreign breeds have from time to time  appeared in this country, yet almost all of them have been viewed  merely as objects of curiosity, and, as such, have speedily been  disregarded. Far different, however, was the reception of the Merinos.  Brought into England under the most favourable auspices, and placed at  once under the fostering protection of royalty, their native merits  could not but be speedily appreciated and diffused throughout the  kingdom. They have received the name of _Merino_ from a peculiar buff  or reddish hue of the countenance, and are supposed to have come  originally from Africa; at least Marcus Columella, having seen a  strange variety from that country exhibited at Rome, during some  public games or shows, took them to his farm, and, having crossed them  with the breeds of Tarentum, sent the offspring to Spain. There they  throve remarkably, attracting the attention of other nations, to whom  they were from time to time exported, and at present may be found in  almost every part of the world.    Merinos were brought to England for the first time in 1788, but  attracted little attention, owing to the want of rams. Lord Somerville  went to Portugal in 1801, for the purpose of selecting such animals as  appeared valuable, from uniting a good carcass with a superior fleece,  and he succeeded, notwithstanding the disturbed state of the country,  in obtaining specimens, which called forth the praises of the  shepherds, through whose travelling flocks they passed. Public  attention was attracted to them on the commencement of his Majesty's  sales in 1804; and their distribution over the country was  accomplished in 1811, by the formation of the principal landed  proprietors and eminent breeders into a Merino Society.    The Merinos had much prejudice to encounter on being first brought  before the public in 1804; but they soon rose in favour and value, and  steadily progressed till the Merino Society was established, when,  strange though it may appear, all these advantages were at once  destroyed. This paradox may, perhaps, be explained, by supposing that  the institution of local committees, which immediately followed,  allowed the enemies of the change, in distant parts of the kingdom,  ample opportunity of striking at the scheme, now that it was  entrusted, in many instances, to persons ill qualified for the task  either of making converts, or retaining the advantages already gained.    The horns of the Merino are of large size, twisted spirally and  extended laterally, approaching closely in these characters to the  sheep of Mount Parnassus, a specimen of which is delineated in the  work by E. T. Bennett, on the Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological  Society. The face has a characteristic velvety appearance, but the  cheeks and forehead are disfigured by coarse hair. The legs are long  and small in the bone; the breast and back are narrow, the sides flat,  and too much of the weight is expended on the coarser parts. There is  a peculiar looseness of skin beneath the throat, which is admired in  Spain as denoting a tendency to weight and fineness of wool, though  regarded in this country as a sign of a bad skin and want of aptitude  to fatten. The average weight of the fleece in Spain is, 8 lbs. from  the ram, and 5 lbs. from the ewe. The abundance of the yolk enables  the wool to detain all the filth which comes in contact with it, so  much so, that by washing the weight is diminished about three-fifths.  The fibre of the wool is finer than that of any other sheep, and the  carcass, when fat, averages from 12 lbs. to 16 lbs. a-quarter. They  are quiet and tractable, and possessed of many good qualities, but  they are liable to abortion, are bad nurses, and require a large  supply of food, for which, owing to an unprofitable form, they yield  no return. Fig. 2. Pl. IV.    The Merinos were at one time in great request in various countries,  from a supposition that they would speedily supplant other breeds; but  this has never been the case, as the animal soon degenerates when out  of Spain, and is only valuable so far as giving rise to varieties,  which are equal, if not superior to itself. Large profits were at  first expected from their wool, but these were reduced to a trifle  when the loss of weight, and fineness in the carcass were taken into  account. Mr Hose of Melton Mowbray, put a certain number of Leicester  ewes to a ram of the same breed, and an equal number to a merino ram.  The result was, that the Leicester fleece weighed 7 lbs., and the one  from the cross with the merino, 8 lbs.; and that the former brought in  the market 1s. per lb., and the latter 1s. 6d., being a gain of 5s. on  the fleece. The carcass of the former, however, weighed 27 lbs. per  quarter, and the latter only 25 lbs., being a loss of 5 lbs. on  mutton. Much advantage may, however, be expected from our crosses with  the Saxon merino, which is in every respect well suited to our notions  of a fine animal, as it yields a good wool, and is little inferior in  carcass to some of our best breeds.    (17.) _Teeth of Sheep._--In common with the rest of the ruminating  animals, sheep have eight incisors in the lower jaw, unopposed by any  in the upper, a callous pad, which is substituted, being attached to  the distal end of the intermaxillarv bones. Between the incisors and  molars, or grinding teeth, there is a vacant space of about an inch  and a half. There are twenty-four molars, six on each side of each  jaw; their crowns are marked with two double crescents, the convexity  of which is turned inwards in the upper, and outwards in the lower  jaw. The lamb, when newly dropped, is devoid of incisor teeth, though  the two central ones are occasionally above the gum even at this early  period. When one month old, the first set of incisive teeth are  complete. The two fore-teeth of the under jaw drop out at the end of  the first year; six months after the two next to these are lost; and  at the end of five years the teeth are all renewed. When the permanent  teeth are fully grown, it is almost impossible to ascertain the age of  the animal, as the soil, the texture of the provender, and the  original form of the teeth, have all a greater or less influence over  their durability.    (18.) _Distinctions between the Sheep and Goat._--Though a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#3)"],[1,"coastal influences than the Arunta, have a modified belief in the All  Father. How are we to account for this on the philosophic hypothesis of  Oceanus as the father of all the gods; of coastal influences producing a  richer life, and causing both social and religious progress?    Another difficulty is that while the Arunta, with no religion, and the  Kaitish, with the Atnatu belief, are socially advanced in organisation  (whether we reckon male descent of the totem 'a great step in  progress,' or an accident), they are yet supposed by Mr. Frazer to be,  in one respect, the least advanced, the most primitive, of known human  beings. The reason is this: the Arunta do not recognise the processes  of sexual union as the cause of the production of children. Sexual  acts, they say, merely prepare women for the reception of original  ancestral spirits, which enter into them, and are reincarnated and  brought to the birth.    If the women cannot accept the spirits without being 'prepared' by  sexual union, then sexual union plays a physical part in the generation  of a spirit incarnated, a fact which all believers in the human soul  are as ready as the Arunta to admit. If the Arunta recognise the  prior necessity of 'preparation,' then they are not so ignorant as  they are thought to be; and their view is produced, not so much by  stark ignorance, as by their philosophy of the eternal reincarnation of  primal human spirits. The Arunta philosophers, in fact, seem to  concentrate their speculation on a point which puzzled Mr. Shandy. How  does the animating principle, or soul, regarded as immaterial, clothe  itself in flesh? Material acts cannot effect the incarnation of a  spirit. Therefore, the spirit enters women from without, and is not the  direct result of human action.    The south-eastern tribes, with female descent of the totem, and with no  belief in the universal and constant reincarnation of ancestral  spirits, take the 'schylean view, according to Mr. Howitt, that the  male is the sole originating cause of children, while the female is  only the recipient and 'nurse.' These tribes, socially less advanced  than the Arunta, have not the Arunta nescience of the facts of  procreation, a nescience which I regard as merely the consequence and  corollary of the Arunta philosophy of reincarnation. Each Arunta child,  by that philosophy, has been in being since the Alcheringa: his mother  of the moment only reproduces him, after 'preparation.' He is not a new  thing; he is as old as the development of organic forms. This is the  Arunta belief, and I must reckon it as not more primitive than the  peculiar philosophy of reincarnation of ancestral spirits. Certainly  such an elaborate philosophy manifestly cannot be primitive. It is,  however, the philosophy of the tribes from the Urabunna, on Lake Eyre  (with female descent of the totem), to the most northerly tribes, with  male descent.    But among none of these tribes has the philosophy that extraordinary  effect on totemic institutions which, by a peculiar and isolated  addition, it possesses among the septs of the Arunta nation, and in a  limited way among the Kaitish.    Among all tribes except these the child inherits its totem: from the  mother, among the Urabunna; from the father in the northern peoples.  But, among the Arunta and Kaitish, the totem is not inherited from  either parent. According to the belief of these tribes, in every  district there is a place where the first human ancestors--in each case  all of one totem, whichsoever that totem, in each case, might happen to  be--died, 'went under the earth.' Rocks or trees arose to mark such  spots. These places are haunted by the spirits of the dead ancestors;  here they are all Grubs, there all Eagle Hawks, or all Iguanas, or all  Emus, or all Cats. Or as in these sites the ancestors left each his own  sacred stone, CHURINGA NANJA, with archaic patterns inscribed on it,  patterns now fancifully interpreted as totemic inscriptions. Such  stones are especially haunted by the ancestral souls, all desiring  reincarnation.    When a woman becomes aware of the life of the child she bears, among  the Arunta and Kaitish, she supposes that a local spirit of the local  totem has entered her, and her child's totem is therefore the totem of  that locality, whatever other totems she and her husbands may own. The  stone amulet of the ancestral spirit, WHO IS THE CHILD, is sought; if  it cannot be found at the spot, a wooden CHURINGA is made to represent  it, and it is kept carefully in a sacred storehouse.    Even in the centre and north, where the belief in reincarnation  prevails, this odd manner of acquiring totems is only practised by the  Arunta tribes and the Kaitish, and only among them are the inscribed  stones known to exist as favoured haunts of ancestral spirits desiring  incarnation. The other northern tribes believe in reincarnation, but  not in the haunted sacred stones, which they do not, north of the  Worgaia, possess; nor do they derive totems from locality, but, as  usual, by inheritance.    It thus appears that these Arunta sacred stones are an inseparable  accident of the Arunta method of acquiring the totem. How they and the  faith in them cause that method is not obvious, but the two things--the  haunted sacred stone, and the local source of totems--are  inseparable--that is, the former never is found apart from the latter.  Now such stones, with the sense and usage attached to them, cannot well  be primitive. They are the result of the peculiar and strictly isolated  Arunta custom and belief, which gives to each man and woman one of  these stones, the property of himself or herself, since the mythical  age, through all reincarnations.    One cannot see how such an unique custom and belief, associated with  objects of art, can be reckoned primitive. Yet, where such stones do  not exist, the usage of acquiring totems by locality does not exist;  even where the belief in reincarnation and in local centres haunted by  totemic spirits is found in North Australia. [For an hypothesis of the  origin of the CHURINGA NANJA belief, see my SECRET OF THE TOTEM,  chapter iv.]    On these grounds it appears that the hereditary totem is the earlier,  and that the Arunta usage is the result of the special and inseparable  superstition about the sacred stones. It may be a relatively recent  complication of and addition to the theory of reincarnation. Meanwhile,  the belief and usage produce an unique effect. The Arunta and Kaitish,  we saw, are so advanced socially that they possess not two, or four,  but eight matrimonial classes. The tribe is divided into two sets of  four classes each, and no person in A division (nameless) of four  classes may marry another person of any one of these four, but must  marry a person of a given class among the four in B division  (nameless). The succession to the class is hereditary in the mate line.  But any person among the Arunta, contrary to universal custom  elsewhere, may marry another person of his or her own totem, if that  person be in the right class of the opposite division. Nowhere else can  a person of division A and totem Grub find a Grub to marry in the  opposite division B. But this is possible among the Arunta and Kaitish,  because their totems are acquired by pure accident, are not hereditary,  and all totems exist, or may exist, in division A and also in division B.    Mr. Frazer argues that the Arunta is the earlier state of affairs. He  supposes that men acquired their totems, at first, by local accident,  before they had laid any restrictions on marriage. Later, they divided  their tribe, first into two, then into four, then into eight classes;  and every one had to marry out of his class, or set of classes. All  other known tribes introduced these restrictions after totems had been  made hereditary. On passing the restrictive marriage law, they merely  drafted people of one set of hereditary totems into one division, all  the other totem kins into the other division. But the Arunta had not  made totems hereditary, but accidental, so all the children of one  crowd of mothers were placed in division A, all other children in  division B. The mothers in each division would have children of all the  totems, and thus the same totems now appeared in both of the exogamous  divisions. If a man married into his lawful opposite class, the fact  that the woman was of the same totem made no difference.    I have offered quite an opposite explanation. Arunta totems were,  originally, hereditary among the Arunta, as everywhere else, and no  totem occurred in both exogamous divisions. The same totems, later, got  into both divisions as the result of the later and isolated belief in  reincarnation PLUS the sacred haunted stones. That superstition has  left the Kaitish PRACTICE of marriage still almost untouched. A Kaitish  MAY, like an Arunta, marry a woman of his own totem, but he scarcely  ever does so. The old prohibition, extinct in law, persists in custom;  unless we say that the Kaitish are now merely imitating the usual  practice of the rest of the totemic races of the world.    Moreover, even among the Arunta, certain totems greatly preponderate in  each of the two exogamous intermarrying divisions of the tribe. This  must be because the present practice has not yet quite upset the  ancient usage, by which no totem ever occurred in both divisions. There  is even an Arunta myth asserting that this was so, but it is, of  course, of no historical value as evidence. Here it is proper to give  Mr. Frazer's contrary theory in his own words:--    'This [Arunta] mode of determining the totem has all the appearance of  extreme antiquity. For it ignores altogether the intercourse of the  sexes as the cause of offspring, and further, it ignores the tie of  blood on the maternal as well as the paternal side, substituting for it  a purely local bond, since the"]]]
