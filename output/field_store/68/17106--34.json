I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be  a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.\"    \"I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent.\"    \"Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my  business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got  that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe,  and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I don't mind  saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good Aberdeen  upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray  hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand on my shoulder  as we were parting, it was like a father's blessing before you go out  into the cold, cruel world.\"    Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \"Great!\" he said. \"Great! Tell me,  Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose,  in the professor's study?\"    \"That's so.\"    \"A fine room, is it not?\"    \"Very fine--very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"You sat in front of his writing desk?\"    \"Just so.\"    \"Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?\"    \"Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.\"    \"It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor's  head?\"    \"I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I  saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at  you sideways.\"    \"That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.\"    The inspector endeavoured to look interested.    \"Jean Baptiste Greuze,\" Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and  leaning well back in his chair, \"was a French artist who flourished  between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working  career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed  of him by his contemporaries.\"    The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. \"Hadn't we better--\" he said.    \"We are doing so,\" Holmes interrupted. \"All that I am saying has a  very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone  Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.\"    MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. \"Your thoughts  move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,  and I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the  connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\"    \"All knowledge comes useful to the detective,\" remarked Holmes. \"Even  the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled  La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand  francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may start  a train of reflection in your mind.\"    It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.    \"I may remind you,\" Holmes continued, \"that the professor's salary can  be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven  hundred a year.\"    \"Then how could he buy--\"    \"Quite so! How could he?\"    \"Ay, that's remarkable,\" said the inspector thoughtfully. \"Talk away,  Mr. Holmes. I'm just loving it. It's fine!\"    Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration--the  characteristic of the real artist. \"What about Birlstone?\" he asked.    \"We've time yet,\" said the inspector, glancing at his watch. \"I've a cab  at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about  this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never  met Professor Moriarty.\"    \"No, I never have.\"    \"Then how do you know about his rooms?\"    \"Ah, that's another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice  waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came.  Once--well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective.  It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his  papers--with the most unexpected results.\"    \"You found something compromising?\"    \"Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen  the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How  did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station  master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year.  And he owns a Greuze.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Surely the inference is plain.\"    \"You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an  illegal fashion?\"    \"Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so--dozens of  exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web  where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention  the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own  observation.\"    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it's more  than interesting--it's just wonderful. But let us have it a little  clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where does the  money come from?\"    \"Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?\"    \"Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I  don't take much stock of detectives in novels--chaps that do things  and never let you see how they do them. That's just inspiration: not  business.\"    \"Jonathan Wild wasn't a detective, and he wasn't in a novel. He was a  master criminal, and he lived last century--1750 or thereabouts.\"    \"Then he's no use to me. I'm a practical man.\"    \"Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would  be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day  at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles--even Professor  Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals,  to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent.  commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It's all  been done before, and will be again. I'll tell you one or two things  about Moriarty which may interest you.\"    \"You'll interest me, right enough.\"    \"I happen to know who is the first link in his chain--a chain with  this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men,  pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every  sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran,  as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you  think he pays him?\"    \"I'd like to hear.\"    \"Six thousand a year. That's paying for brains, you see--the American  business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It's more  than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty's gains  and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business  to hunt down some of Moriarty's checks lately--just common innocent  checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six  different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?\"    \"Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?\"    \"That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know  what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the  bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais  as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I  commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.\"    Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the  conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his  practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter  in hand.    \"He can keep, anyhow,\" said he. \"You've got us side-tracked with your  interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark  that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That  you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for  our present practical needs get any further than that?\"    \"We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as  I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an  unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as  we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first  place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his  people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in  his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man--this  Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal's  subordinates--had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment  followed, and would be known to all--if only to put the fear of death  into them.\"    \"Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary  course of business. Was there any robbery?\"    \"I have not heard.\"    \"If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in  favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a  promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage  it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third  combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I  know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which  may lead us to him.\"    \"Then to Birlstone we must go!\" cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair.  \"My word! it's later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five  minutes for preparation, and that is all.\"    \"And ample for us both,\" said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to  change from his dressing gown to his coat. \"While we are on our way, Mr.  Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.\"    \"All about it\" proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was  enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of  the expert's closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands  together as he listened to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#3)"],[1,"as Chief  Justice, and of John Rutledge of South Carolina, William Cushing of  Massachusetts, John Blair of Virginia, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and  James Iredell of North Carolina as Associate Justices. All were known to  be champions of the Constitution, three had been members of the Federal  Convention, four had held high judicial offices in their home States,  and all but Jay were on record as advocates of the principle of judicial  review. Jay was one of the authors of the \"Federalist\", had achieved a  great diplomatic reputation in the negotiations of 1782, and possessed  the political backing of the powerful Livingston family of New York.    The Judiciary Act provided for two terms of court annually, one  commencing the first Monday of February, and the other on the first  Monday of August. On February 2, 1790, the Court opened its doors for  the first time in an upper room of the Exchange in New York City. Up  to the February term of 1798 it had heard but five cases, and until the  accession of Marshall it had decided but fifty-five. The justices  were largely occupied in what one of them described as their \"post-boy  duties,\" that is, in riding their circuits. At first the justices rode  in pairs and were assigned to particular circuits. As a result of this  practice, the Southern justices were forced each year to make two trips  of nearly two thousand miles each and, in order to hold court for two  weeks, often passed two months on the road. In 1792, however, Congress  changed the law to permit the different circuits to be taken in turn and  by single justices, and in the meantime the Court had, in 1791, followed  the rest of the Government to Philadelphia, a rather more central seat.  Then, in 1802, the abolition of the August term eased the burdens of  the justices still more. But of course they still had to put up with bad  roads, bad inns, and bad judicial quarters or sometimes none at all.    Yet that the life of a Supreme Court justice was not altogether one of  discomfort is shown by the following alluring account of the travels of  Justice Cushing on circuit: \"He traveled over the whole of the Union,  holding courts in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. His traveling  equipage was a four-wheeled phaeton, drawn by a pair of horses, which he  drove. It was remarkable for its many ingenious arrangements (all of his  contrivance) for carrying books, choice groceries, and other comforts.  Mrs. Cushing always accompanied him, and generally read aloud while  riding. His faithful servant Prince, a jet-black negro, whose parents  had been slaves in the family and who loved his master with unbounded  affection, followed.\" * Compared with that of a modern judge always  confronted with a docket of eight or nine hundred cases in arrears,  Justice Cushing's lot was perhaps not so unenviable.         * Flanders, \"The Lives and Times of the Chief-Justices of       the Supreme Court,\" vol. II, p. 38.      The pioneer work of the Supreme Court in constitutional interpretation  has, for all but special students, fallen into something like obscurity  owing to the luster of Marshall's achievements and to his habit of  deciding cases without much reference to precedent. But these early  labors are by no means insignificant, especially since they pointed  the way to some of Marshall's most striking decisions. In Chisholm vs.  Georgia, * which was decided in 1793, the Court ruled, in the face of an  assurance in the \"Federalist\" to the contrary, that an individual  might sue a State; and though this decision was speedily disallowed by  resentful debtor States by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, its  underlying premise that, \"as to the purposes of the Union, the States  are not sovereign\" remained untouched; and three years later the Court  affirmed the supremacy of national treaties over conflicting state  laws and so established a precedent which has never been disturbed.**  Meantime the Supreme Court was advancing, though with notable caution,  toward an assertion of the right to pass upon the constitutionality of  acts of Congress. Thus in 1792, Congress ordered the judges while  on circuit to pass upon pension claims, their determinations to be  reviewable by the Secretary of the Treasury. In protests which they  filed with the President, the judges stated the dilemma which confronted  them: either the new duty was a judicial one or it was not; if the  latter, they could not perform it, at least not in their capacity as  judges; if the former, then their decisions were not properly reviewable  by an executive officer. Washington promptly sent the protests to  Congress, whereupon some extremists raised the cry of impeachment; but  the majority hastened to amend the Act so as to meet the views of the  judges.*** Four years later, in the Carriage Tax case,**** the  only question argued before the Court was that of the validity of a  congressional excise. Yet as late as 1800 we find Justice Samuel Chase  of Maryland, who had succeeded Blair in 1795, expressing skepticism as  to the right of the Court to disallow acts of Congress on the ground of  their unconstitutionality, though at the same time admitting that the  prevailing opinion among bench and bar supported the claim.         * 2 Dallas, 419.         ** Ware vs. Hylton, 3 ib., 199.         *** See 2 Dallas, 409.         **** Hylton vs. United States, 3 Dallas, 171.    The great lack of the Federal Judiciary during these early years, and  it eventually proved well-nigh fatal, was one of leadership. Jay was  a satisfactory magistrate, but he was not a great force on the Supreme  Bench, partly on account of his peculiarities of temperament and his  ill-health, and partly because, even before he resigned in 1795 to run  for Governor in New York, his judicial career had been cut short by  an important diplomatic assignment to England. His successor, Oliver  Ellsworth, also suffered from ill health, and he too was finally  sacrificed on the diplomatic altar by being sent to France in 1799.  During the same interval there were also several resignations among the  associate justices. So, what with its shifting personnel, the lack  of business, and the brief semiannual terms, the Court secured only a  feeble hold on the imagination of the country. It may be thought, no  doubt, that judges anxious to steer clear of politics did not require  leadership in the political sense. But the truth of the matter is that  willy-nilly the Federal Judiciary at this period was bound to enter  politics, and the only question was with what degree of tact and  prudence this should be done. It was to be to the glory of Marshall that  he recognized this fact perfectly and with mingled boldness and caution  grasped the leadership which the circumstances demanded.    The situation at the beginning was precarious enough. While the  Constitution was yet far from having commended itself to the back  country democracy, that is, to the bulk of the American people, the  normal duties of the lower Federal Courts brought the judges into daily  contact with prevalent prejudices and misconceptions in their most  aggravated forms. Between 1790 and 1800 there were two serious uprisings  against the new Government: the Whisky Rebellion of 1794 and Fries's  Rebellion five years later. During the same period the popular ferment  caused by the French Revolution was at its height. Entrusted with the  execution of the laws, the young Judiciary \"was necessarily thrust  forward to bear the brunt in the first instance of all the opposition  levied against the federal head,\" its revenue measures, its commercial  restrictions, its efforts to enforce neutrality and to quell uprisings.  In short, it was the point of attrition between the new system and a  suspicious, excited populace.    Then, to make bad matters worse, Congress in 1798 passed the Sedition  Act. Had political discretion instead of party venom governed the  judges, it is not unlikely that they would have seized the opportunity  presented by this measure to declare it void and by doing so would have  made good their censorship of acts of Congress with the approval of even  the Jeffersonian opposition. Instead, they enforced the Sedition  Act, often with gratuitous rigor, while some of them even entertained  prosecutions under a supposed Common Law of the United States. The  immediate sequel to their action was the claim put forth in the Virginia  and Kentucky Resolutions that the final authority in interpreting  the National Constitution lay with the local legislatures. Before the  principle of judicial review was supported by a single authoritative  decision, it had thus become a partisan issue! *       * See Herman vs. Ames, \"State Documents on Federal Relations,\"  Nos. 7-15.      A few months later Jefferson was elected President, and the Federalists,  seeing themselves about to lose control of the Executive and Congress,  proceeded to take steps to convert the Judiciary into an avowedly  partisan stronghold. By the Act of February 18, 1801, the number of  associate justiceships was reduced to four, in the hope that the new  Administration might in this way be excluded from the opportunity of  making any appointments to the Supreme Bench, the number of district  judgeships was enlarged by five, and six Circuit Courts were created  which furnished places for sixteen more new judges. When John Adams, the  retiring President, proceeded with the aid of the Federalist majority in  the Senate and of his Secretary of State, John Marshall, to fill up  the new posts with the so-called \"midnight judges,\" * the rage and  consternation of the Republican leaders broke all bounds. The Federal  Judiciary, declared John Randolph, had become \"an hospital of decayed  politicians.\" Others pictured the country as reduced, under the weight  of \"supernumerary judges\" and hosts of attendant lawyers, to the  condition of Egypt under the Mamelukes."]]]
