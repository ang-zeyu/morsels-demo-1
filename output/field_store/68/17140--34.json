[Sidenote: 4. Effect of deficiency of ingredient? Usefulness of the lime?  Of the animal substance? Effect of their union? Condition, in youth? Old  age?]    4. If, for any reason, either of these ingredients is disproportionate in  the bone during life, the body is in danger. The lime is useful in giving  rigidity of form, while the animal substance insures toughness and  elasticity. By their union, we are able to withstand greater shocks and  heavier falls than would be possible with either alone. In youth, the  period of greatest activity, the animal constituent is in excess: a bone  then does not break so readily, but, when broken, unites with great  rapidity and strength. On the other hand, the bones of old persons are more  easily broken, and in some cases fail to unite. The mineral matter being  then in excess, indicates that the period of active exertion is drawing to  a close.    {17}    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF BONE.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.    Structure of bone enlarged.]    [Sidenote: 5. In what respect admirably fashioned? Its formation?  Microscopic examination? The inference? \"Line of beauty?\"]    5. THE STRUCTURE OF THE BONES.--If we examine one of the long bones, which  has been sawn through lengthwise, we observe that it is admirably fashioned  for affording lightness as well as strength (Fig. 1). Its exterior is hard  and resisting, but it is porous at the broad extremities, while through the  central portion there is a cavity or canal which contains an oily  substance, called _marrow_. Let us now take a thin section of bone, and  examine it under the microscope; we discover that it is pierced by numerous  fine tubes (Fig. 2), about which layers of bone-substance are arranged.  Accordingly, though a bone be as hard as stone externally, it is by no  means as heavy as stone, by reason of its light interior texture. Another  element of power is found in the curved outline of the bones. The curved  line is said to be \"the line of beauty,\" as it certainly is the line of  strength, and is uniformly employed in the bones whose position exposes  them to accident.    {18}    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE SKELETON]    {19}    [Sidenote: 6. Number of bones? Skeleton? The skull? Chest? The trunk? The  trunk and skull, how maintained? What of the arms? Legs?]    6. THE SKELETON.--The number of bones in the human body exceeds two  hundred. When these are joined together in the proper places, they form  what is termed the _Skeleton_ (Fig. 3). It embraces three important  cavities. The first, surmounting the frame, is a box of bone, called the  _skull;_ below this, is a bony case, or \"chest;\" and lower down is a bony  basin, called the _pelvis_. The two latter compose the trunk. The trunk and  skull are maintained in their proper relations by the \"spinal column.\"  Branching from the trunk are two sets of limbs: the arms, which are  attached to the chest by means of the \"collar-bone\" and \"shoulder-blade;\"  and the legs, directly joined to the lower part of the trunk.    [Sidenote: 7. Design of the cavities? Give the examples.]    7. The cavities of which we have spoken, are designed for the lodgment and  protection of the more delicate and perishable parts of the system. Thus,  the skull, together with the bones of the face, shelters the brain and the  organs of four senses--sight, hearing, smell, and taste. The chest contains  the heart, lungs, and great blood-vessels, while the lower part of the  trunk sustains the liver, stomach, and other organs.    [Sidenote: 8. Joint or articulation? Movable joints, how compacted? The  ligaments of the movable joints? What is a sprain? Consequence of a serious  sprain?]    8. THE JOINTS.--The point of union of two or more bones forms a joint or  _articulation_, the connection being made in various ways according to the  kind and amount of motion desired. The movable joints are compacted  together by certain strong fibrous bands, called ligaments. These ligaments  are of a shining, silvery whiteness, and very unyielding; so much so, that  when sudden violence is brought to bear in the vicinity of a joint, the  bone to which a ligament is attached may be broken, while the ligament  itself remains uninjured. When this connecting material of the joints is  strained or lacerated by an {20} accident, a \"sprain\" is the consequence.  An injury of this sort may be, and frequently is, quite as serious as the  breaking of a bone.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--CELLS OF CARTILAGE.]    [Sidenote: 9. Office of the ligament? What must it have? How accomplished?  Describe it. Synovia?]    9. The ligament, then, secures firmness to the joint; it must also have  flexibility and smoothness of motion. This is accomplished by a beautiful  mechanism the perfection of which is only feebly imitated by the most  ingenious contrivance of man. The ends of the bones are covered by a thin  layer of _cartilage_, which being smooth and elastic, renders all the  movements of the joint very easy. In addition to this, there is an  arrangement introduced for \"lubricating\" the joint, by means of a delicate  sac containing fluid. This fluid is constantly supplied in small  quantities, but only so fast as it is used up in exercise. In appearance,  it is not unlike the white of an egg, and hence its name _synovia_, or  egg-like.    [Sidenote: 10. What do we observe as regards the composition of a joint?  The ligament and cartilage? What varies? Example of the skull? Other  examples? The ball-and-socket joint?]    10. Thus, we observe, that two very different substances enter into the  composition of a joint. The ligament, very unyielding, affords strength,  while the cartilage, elastic and moist, gives ease and smoothness of  motion. The amount of motion provided for varies greatly in different  joints. In some there is none at all, as in the skull, where one bone is  dove-tailed into another by what are termed _sutures_. Others have a  hinge-like motion, such as those of the elbow, wrist, ankle, and knee; the  most complete of these being the elbow-joint (Fig. 5). Belonging to another  class, the {21} ball-and-socket joint, is that at the shoulder, possessing  a freedom of motion greater than any other in the body.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--ELBOW JOINT. A, Bone of the arm; B, C, Bones of the  fore-arm.]    [Sidenote: 11. What is the spinal column? What does it connect and form?  Joints of the vertebrae? Amount of motion? Result?]    11. THE SPINAL COLUMN.--The spinal column is often spoken of as the  \"back-bone,\" as if it were a single bone, while, in reality, it is composed  of a chain of twenty-six small bones, called _vertebrae_. The spinal column  is a wonderful piece of mechanism. It not only connects the important  cavities of the body, as has already been shown, but, also, itself forms a  canal, which contains the spinal cord. The joints of the vertebrae are  remarkable for the thick layers of cartilage which separate the adjacent  surfaces of bone. The amount of motion between any two of these bones is  not great; but these little movements, taken together, admit of very  considerable flexibility, in several directions, without endangering the  supporting power of the column.    {22}    [Sidenote: 12. Elasticity of the frame? Protection of the brain from  shocks? Tallness of persons? Effects of reclining?]    [Illustration: FIG. 6--THE SPINAL COLUMN.]    12. The abundant supply of intervertebral cartilage has another important  use, namely, it adds greatly to the elasticity of the frame. It is due, in  part, to this elastic material, and in part to the frequent curves of the  spine, that the brain and other delicate organs are protected from the  shock of sudden falls or jars. During the day, the constant pressure upon  these joints, while the body is erect, diminishes the thickness of the  cartilages; so that a person is not so tall in the evening as in the  morning. The effects of this compression pass away when the body reclines  in a horizontal position.    [Sidenote: 13. Change in bone? Example--animal and madder. Rapidity of  change in color? Waste and repair?]    13. THE GROWTH OF BONE.--Bone, like all the other tissues of the body, is  constantly undergoing change, old material being withdrawn, and new  particles taking their place. This has been shown conclusively by  experiments. If an animal be fed with madder--a red coloring matter--for a  day or two, the bones soon become tinged; then, if the madder be  discontinued for a few days, the original color returns. If, however, this  material be alternately given and withheld, at short intervals, the bone  will be marked by a succession of red and white rings. In very young  animals, all the bones become colored in a single day; in older ones, a  longer time is required. The process of waste and repair, therefore, is  constantly taking place in this hard substance, and with astonishing  rapidity. {23}    14. THE REPAIR OF BONE.--Nature's provision for uniting broken bones is  very complete. At first, blood is poured out around the ends of the bone,  as a result of the injury. This is gradually absorbed, and gives place to a  watery fluid, which, thickening from day to day, acquires, at the end of  two weeks, the consistency of jelly. This begins to harden, by a deposit of  new bone-substance, until, at the expiration of five or six weeks, the  broken bone may be said to be united. It is, however, still fragile, and  must be used carefully a few weeks longer. The process of hardening  continues, and months must pass before the union can be said to be  complete.

It is quite a quarter of a century  since I last saw the saucy cricket hunter. When I made her acquaintance,  I used to visit her at a few miles' distance: each time, it meant an  expedition under the blazing August sun. Today, I find her at my door;  we are intimate neighbors. The embrasure of the closed window provides  an apartment of a mild temperature for the Pelopaeus [a mason wasp]. The  earth-built nest is fixed against the freestone wall. To enter her home,  the spider huntress uses a little hole left open by accident in the  shutters. On the moldings of the Venetian blinds, a few stray mason  bees build their group of cells; inside the outer shutters, left ajar, a  Eumenes [a mason wasp] constructs her little earthen dome, surmounted by  a short, bell-mouthed neck. The common wasp and the Polistes [a solitary  wasp] are my dinner guests: they visit my table to see if the grapes  served are as ripe as they look.    Here, surely--and the list is far from complete--is a company both  numerous and select, whose conversation will not fail to charm my  solitude, if I succeed in drawing it out. My dear beasts of former days,  my old friends, and others, more recent acquaintances, all are here,  hunting, foraging, building in close proximity. Besides, should we wish  to vary the scene of observation, the mountain [Ventoux] is but a  few hundred steps away, with its tangle of arbutus, rock roses and  arborescent heather; with its sandy spaces dear to the Bembeces; with  its marly slopes exploited by different wasps and bees. And that is why,  foreseeing these riches, I have abandoned the town for the village and  come to Serignan to weed my turnips and water my lettuces.    Laboratories are being founded, at great expense, on our Atlantic and  Mediterranean coasts, where people cut up small sea animals, of but  meager interest to us; they spend a fortune on powerful microscopes,  delicate dissecting instruments, engines of capture, boats, fishing  crews, aquariums, to find out how the yolk of an Annelid's egg is  constructed, a question whereof I have never yet been able to grasp the  full importance; and they scorn the little land animal, which lives  in constant touch with us, which provides universal psychology with  documents of inestimable value, which too often threatens the public  wealth by destroying our crops. When shall we have an entomological  laboratory for the study not of the dead insect, steeped in alcohol, but  of the living insect; a laboratory having for its object the instinct,  the habits, the manner of living, the work, the struggles, the  propagation of that little world, with which agriculture and philosophy  have most seriously to reckon?    To know thoroughly the history of the destroyer of our vines might  perhaps be more important than to know how this or that nerve fiber of  a Cirriped [sea animals with hair-like legs, including the barnacles and  acorn shells] ends; to establish by experiment the line of demarcation  between intellect and instinct; to prove, by comparing facts in the  zoological progression, whether human reason be an irreducible faculty  or not: all this ought surely to take precedence of the number of joints  in a Crustacean's antenna. These enormous questions would need an army  of workers; and we have not one. The fashion is all for the Mollusk  and the Zoophytes [plant-like sea animals, including starfishes,  jellyfishes, sea anemones and sponges]. The depths of the sea are  explored with many drag nets; the soil which we tread is consistently  disregarded. While waiting for the fashion to change, I open my harmas  laboratory of living entomology; and this laboratory shall not cost the  ratepayers one farthing.          CHAPTER II. THE ANTHRAX    I made the acquaintance of the Anthrax in 1855 at Carpentras, at the  time when the life history of the oil beetles was causing me to search  the tall slopes beloved of the Anthophora bees [mason bees]. Her curious  pupae, so powerfully equipped to force an outlet for the perfect  insect incapable of the least effort, those pupae armed with a multiple  plowshare at the fore, a trident at the rear and rows of harpoons on the  back wherewith to rip open the Osmia bee's cocoon and break through  the hard crust of the hillside, betokened a field that was worth  cultivating. The little that I said about her at the time brought me  urgent entreaties: I was asked for a circumstantial chapter on the  strange fly. The stern necessities of life postponed to an ever  retreating future my beloved investigations, so miserably stifled.  Thirty years have passed; at last, a little leisure is at hand; and  here, in the harmas of my village, with an ardor that has in no wise  grown old, I have resumed my plans of yore, still alive like the coal  smoldering under the ashes. The Anthrax has told me her secrets, which I  in my turn am going to divulge. Would that I could address all those who  cheered me on this path, including first and foremost the revered Master  of the Landes [Leon Dufour]. But the ranks have thinned, many have been  promoted to another world and their disciple lagging behind them can but  record, in memory of those who are no more, the story of the insect clad  in deepest mourning.    In the course of July, let us give a few sideward knocks to the bracing  pebbles and detach the nests of the Chalicodoma of the Walls [a mason  bee] from their supports. Loosened by the shock, the dome comes off  cleanly, all in one piece. Moreover--and this is a great advantage--the  cells come into view wide open on the base of the exposed nest, for at  this point they have no other wall than the surface of the pebble. In  this way, without any scraping, which would be wearisome work for the  operator and dangerous to the inhabitants of the dome, we have all the  cells before our eyes, together with their contents, consisting of a  silky, amber-yellow cocoon, as delicate and translucent as an onion  peeling. Let us split the dainty wrapper with the scissors, chamber by  chamber, nest by nest. If fortune be at all propitious, as it always is  to the persevering, we shall end by finding that the cocoons harbor two  larvae together, one more or less faded in appearance, the other fresh  and plump. We shall also find some, no less plentiful, in which the  withered larva is accompanied by a family of little grubs wriggling  uneasily around it.    Examination at once reveals the tragedy that is happening under the  cover of the cocoon. The flacid and faded larva is the mason bee's.  A month ago, in June, having finished its mess of honey, it wove its  silken sheath for a bedchamber wherein to take the long sleep which is  the prelude to the metamorphosis. Bulging with fat, it is a rich and  defenseless morsel for whoever is able to reach it. Then, in spite  of apparently insurmountable obstacles, the mortar wall and the tent  without an opening, the flesh-eating larvae appeared in the secret  retreat and are now glutting themselves on the sleeper. Three different  species take part in the carnage, often in the same nest, in adjoining  cells. The diversity of shapes informs us of the presence of more than  one enemy; the final stage of the creatures will tell us the names and  qualities of the three invaders.    Forestalling the secrets of the future for the sake of greater  clearness, I will anticipate the actual facts and come at once to the  results produced. When it is by itself on the body of the mason bee's  larva, the murderous grub belongs either to Anthrax trifasciata, MEIGEN,  or to Leucospis gigas, FAB. But, if numerous little worms, often a score  and more, swarm around the victim, then it is a Chalcidid's family which  we have before us. Each of these ravagers shall have its biography. Let  us begin with the Anthrax.    And first the grub, as it is after consuming its victim, when it remains  the sole occupant of the mason bee's cocoon. It is a naked worm, smooth,  legless and blind, of a creamy dead white, each segment a perfect ring,  very much curved when at rest, but with the tendency to become  almost straight when disturbed. Through the diaphanous skin, the lens  distinguishes patches of fat, which are the cause of its characteristic  coloring. When younger, as a tiny grub a few millimeters long, it is  streaked with two different kinds of stains, some white, opaque and of a  creamy tint, others translucent and of the palest amber. The former  come from adipose masses in course of formation; the second from the  nourishing fluid or from the blood which laves those masses.    Including the head, I count thirteen segments. In the middle of the body  these segments are well marked, being separated by a slight groove; but  in the forepart they are difficult to count. The head is small and is  soft, like the rest of the body, with no sign of any mouth parts even  under the close scrutiny of the lens. It is a white globule, the size  of a tiny pin's head and continued at the back by a pad a little larger,  from which it is separated by a scarcely appreciable crease. The whole  is a sort of nipple swelling slightly on the upper surface; and its  double structure is so difficult to perceive that at first we take it  for the animal's head alone, though it includes both the head and the  prothorax, or first segment of the thorax.    The mesothorax, or middle segment of the thorax, which is two or three  times larger in diameter, is flattened in front and separated from the  nipple formed by the prothorax and the head by a deep, narrow, curved  fissure. On its front surface are two pale red stigmata, or respiratory  orifices, placed pretty close together. The metathorax, or last segment  of the thorax, is a little larger still in diameter and protrudes.  These abrupt increases in circumference result in a marked hump, sloping  sharply"]]]
