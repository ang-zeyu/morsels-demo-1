Pixis [a notable pianist (1788-1874)--lived a long time in Paris]  and several other people have spoken much to me of four concertos  that you have lately finished, and the reputation of which is  already making a stir in Paris. I should be very much pleased, my  dear Master, if you would commission me to get them sold. This  would be quite easy for me to do, and I should also have the  pleasure of playing them FROM FIRST HAND, either at the opera or  at some big concerts. If my proposition pleases you, send them to  me by the Austrian Embassy, marking the price that you would like  to have for them. As regards any passages to be altered, if there  are any, you need only mark them with a red pencil, according to  your plan which I know so well, and I will point them out to the  editor with the utmost care. Give me at the same time some news  about music and pianists in Vienna; and finally tell me, dear  Master, which of your compositions you think would make the best  effect in society.    I close by sending you my heartfelt greetings, and begging you  once more to pardon the shameful silence I have kept towards you:  be assured that it has given me as much pain as yourself!    Your very affectionate and grateful pupil,    F. Liszt    December 23rd, 1828    P.S.--Please answer me as soon as possible, for I am longing for  a letter from you; and please embrace your excellent parents from  me. I add my address (Rue Montholon, No. 7bis).        2. To De Mancy in Paris    [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]    December 23rd, 1829    My Dear M. de Mancy,    I am so full of lessons that each day, from half-past eight in  the morning till 10 at night, I have scarcely breathing time.  Please excuse me therefore for not coming, as I should have liked  to do, to lunch with Madame de Mancy, but it is quite impossible.  The only thing I could do would be to come about 10 o'clock, if  that would not be too late for a wedding day, and in that case I  will beg M. Ebner [Carl Ebner, a Hungarian, a talented violinist  (1812-1836)] to come with me. I don't write you a longer letter,  for there is a pupil who has been waiting for me for an hour.  Besides, we are not standing on ceremony. Ever yours,    F. Liszt        3. To Carl Czerny    [Autograph in the Musical Society's Archives in Vienna. Printed  in a German translation: \"La Mara, Letters of Musicians extending  over Five Centuries.\" II. Leipzig, B. and H. 1887.]    My dear and beloved Master,    It would be impossible to explain to you the why and wherefore of  my leaving you so long without news of me. Moreover, I have now  only five minutes in which to write to you, for Mr. Luden, a  pianist from Copenhagen, is starting shortly, and for fear of  delaying his journey I must be brief; but what is postponed is  not lost, so cheer up, for very soon you will get a great thick  letter from me, which I will take care to prepay, as I should not  like to ruin you.    Among all the circles of artists where I go in this country I  plead your cause tremendously: we all want you to come and stay  some time in Paris; it would certainly do you a great deal of  good, and you are so widely esteemed that you will doubtless be  well satisfied with the reception you will meet with here. If you  ever entertain this idea, write to me, I entreat you, for I will  do for you what I would do for my father. I have been making a  special study of your admirable sonata (Op. 7), and have since  played it at several reunions of connoisseurs (or would-be  connoisseurs): you cannot imagine what an effect it made; I was  quite overcome by it. It was in a burst of enthusiasm caused by  the Prestissimo, that Mr. Luden begged for a few words of  introduction to you; I know your kindness, indeed I could never  forget it. I therefore commend him in all confidence of your  goodness, until the time when I am so happy as to embrace you  myself and to show you (however feebly) all the gratitude and  admiration which fill me.    F. Liszt    Paris, August 26th, 1830        4. To Alphonse Brot in Paris    [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]    (Paris, Beginning of the 30th year.)    It would give us great pleasure, my dear M. Brot, if you would  come and dine with us without ceremony tomorrow, Monday, about 6  o'clock; I do not promise you a good dinner,--that is not the  business of us poor artists; but the good company you will meet  will, I trust, make up for that. Monsieur Hugo [the poet] and  Edgard Quinet [French writer and philosopher] have promised to  come. So do try not to disappoint us, for we should miss you  much. My good mother told me to press you to come, for she is  very fond of you. Till tomorrow then! Kind regards and thanks.    F. Liszt    I have been at least six times to you without having the pleasure  of seeing you.    61, Rue de Provence.        5. Monsieur Pierre Wolff (Junior), Rue de la Tertasse, Geneva,  Switzerland    [Autograph in the possession of M. Gaston Calmann-Levy in Paris.]    Nous disons: \"Il est temps. Executons, c'est l'heure.\" Alors nous  retournons les yeux--La Mort est la! Ainsi de mes projets.--Quand  vous verrai-je, Espagne, Et Venise et son golfe, et Rome et sa  campagne,    Toi, Sicile, que ronge un volcan souterrain, Grece qu'on connait  trop, Sardaigne qu'on ignore, Cites de l'Aquilon, du Couchant, de  l'Aurore, Pyramides du Nil, Cathedrales du Rhin! Qui sait?--  jamais peut-etre!    [We say: \"Now it is time. Let's act, for 'tis the hour.\" Then  turn we but our eyes--lo! death is there! Thus with my plans.  When shall I see thee, Espagna, And Venice with her gulf, and  Rome with her Campagna; Thou, Sicily, whom volcanoes undermine;  Greece, whom we know too well, Sardinia, unknown one, Lands of  the north, the west, the rising sun, Pyramids of the Nile,  Cathedrals of the Rhine! Who knows? Never perchance!]    Earthly life is but a malady of the soul, an excitement which is  kept up by the passions. The natural state of the soul is rest!    Paris, May 2nd [1832]    Here is a whole fortnight that my mind and fingers have been  working like two lost spirits, Homer, the Bible, Plato, Locke,  Byron, Hugo, Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Beethoven, Bach, Hummel,  Mozart, Weber, are all around me. I study them, meditate on them,  devour them with fury; besides this I practice four to five hours  of exercises (3rds, 6ths, 8ths, tremolos, repetition of notes,  cadences, etc., etc.). Ah! provided I don't go mad, you will find  an artist in me! Yes, an artist such as you desire, such as is  required nowadays!    \"And I too am a painter!\" cried Michael Angelo the first time he  beheld a chef d'oeuvre...Though insignificant and poor, your  friend cannot leave off repeating those words of the great man  ever since Paganini's last performance. Rene, what a man, what a  violin, what an artist! Heavens! what sufferings, what misery,  what tortures in those four strings!    Here are a few of his characteristics:--    [Figure: Liszt here writes down several tiny excerpts from  musical scores of Paganini's violin music, such as his famous  \"Caprices\"]    As to his expression, his manner of phrasing, his very soul in  fact!----    May 8th [1832]    My good friend, it was in a paroxysm of madness that I wrote you  the above lines; a strain of work, wakefulness, and those violent  desires (for which you know me) had set my poor head aflame; I  went from right to left, then from left to right (like a sentinel  in the winter, freezing), singing, declaiming, gesticulating,  crying out; in a word, I was delirious. Today the spiritual and  the animal (to use the witty language of M. de Maistre) are a  little more evenly balanced; for the volcano of the heart is not  extinguished, but is working silently.--Until when?--    Address your letters to Monsieur Reidet, the receiver-general at  the port of Rouen.    A thousand kind messages to the ladies Boissier. I will tell you  some day the reasons which prevented me from starting for Geneva.  On this subject I shall call you in evidence.    Bertini is in London; Madame Malibran is making her round of  Germany; Messemaecker (how is he getting on?) is resting on his  laurels at Brussels; Aguado has the illustrious maestro Rossini  in tow.--Ah--Hi--Oh--Hu!!!        6. To Ferdinand Hiller    [This letter, published by F. Niecks (\"F. Chopin, Man and  Musician,\" Vol. 1. German by Langhans. Leipzig, Leuckart, 1890),  was written by Liszt and Chopin jointly, and was also signed by  Chopin's friend Franchomme, the violoncellist. The part written  by Chopin is indicated here by parentheses ().--Addressed to the  well-known composer and author, afterwards Director of the  Conservatorium and Concert Society at Cologne (1811-1885).]    This is the twentieth time, at least, that we have tried to meet,  first at my house, then here, with the intention of writing to  you, and always some visit, or some other unforeseen hindrance,  has occurred. I don't know whether Chopin will be strong enough  to make excuses to you; for my part, it seems to me that we have  been so unmannerly and impertinent that no excuses are now  permissible or possible.    We sympathized most deeply in your bereavement, and more deeply  did we wish that we could be with you in order to soften, as far  as possible, the grief of your heart. [Hiller had lost his  father.]    (He has said it all so well that I have nothing to add to excuse  me specially for my negligence or idleness, or whim or  distraction, or--or--or--You know that I can explain myself  better in person, and, this autumn, when I take you home late by  the boulevards to your mother, I shall try to obtain your pardon.

A few moments' consideration will show that the  scientific method is that which most readily affords information. Any  one can instantly comprehend the fact of an object being made to look  ten times its real length; but if told that it is magnified a hundred  times, he does not know what this really means, until he has gone  through the process of finding the square root of a hundred, and learnt  that a hundredfold magnification means a tenfold magnification of each  superficial dimension. If told, for example, that a hair is magnified  six hundred diameters, the knowledge is at once conveyed that it looks  six hundred times as broad as it is; but a statement that the same hair  is magnified three hundred and sixty thousand times, only excites a  gasping sensation of wonder, until it is ascertained by calculation that  the big figures only mean what the little figures express. In these  pages the scientific plan will always be followed.    If expense is not an object, a binocular instrument should be purchased,  and it is well to be provided with an object-glass as low as three or  even four inches focus, which will allow the whole of objects having the  diameter of half an inch or more to be seen at once. Such a low power  is exceedingly well adapted for the examination of living insects, or of  the exquisite preparations of entire insects, which can now be had of  all opticians. Microscopes which have a draw tube can be furnished with  an _erector_, an instrument so called because it erects the images,  which the microscope has turned upside down, through the crossing of the  rays. This is very convenient for making dissections under the  instrument; and it also gives us the means of reducing the magnifying  power of an object-glass, and thus obtaining a larger field. The erector  is affixed to the end of the draw tube, and by pulling it out, or  thrusting it in, the rays from the object-glass are intercepted at  different distances, and various degrees of power obtained.    A binocular microscope is most useful with low powers from two thirds  upwards. A new form, devised by Mr. Stephenson, acts as an erector, and  is very valuable for dissections. It works with high powers.    Beginners will be glad to know how to obtain the magnifying power which  different objects require, and it may be stated that, with a full-sized  microscope, a two-inch object-glass magnifies about twenty-five  diameters with the lowest eye-piece; a one-inch object-glass, or two  thirds, from fifty to sixty diameters; a half-inch about one hundred; a  quarter-inch about two hundred. The use of deeper eye-pieces adds very  considerably to the power, but in proportions which differ with  different makers. One instrument used by the writer has three  eye-pieces, giving with a two thirds object-glass powers of sixty one  hundred and five, and one hundred and eighty respectively; and with a  fifth two hundred and forty, four hundred and thirty, and seven hundred  and twenty, which can be augmented by the use of a draw tube.    It has been well observed that the illumination of objects is quite as  important as the glasses that are employed, and the most experienced  microscopists have never done learning in this matter. Most microscopes  are furnished with two mirrors beneath the stage, one plane and one  concave. The first will throw a few parallel rays through any  transparent object properly placed, and the latter causes a number of  rays to converge, producing a more powerful effect. The first is usually  used in daylight, when the instrument is near a window (one with a north  aspect, out of direct sunlight, being the best); and the second is often  useful when the source of illumination is a candle or a lamp. By varying  the angle of the mirror the light is thrown through the object more or  less obliquely, and its quantity should never be sufficient to pain the  eye. Few objects are seen to the best advantage with a _large_ pencil of  perfectly direct light, and the beginner should practise till the amount  of inclination is obtained which produces the best effect.    It is advisable that the hole in the stage of the microscope should be  large--at least an inch and a half each way--so that the entrance of  oblique rays is not obstructed, and it is desirable that the mirror, in  addition to sliding up and down, should have an arm by which it can be  thrown completely out of the perpendicular plane of the body of the  instrument. This enables such oblique rays to be employed as to give a  dark field, all the light which reaches the eye being _refracted_ by the  object through which it is sent. The opticians sell special pieces of  apparatus for this purpose, but though they are very useful, they do not  render it less desirable to have the mirror mounted as described.    Most microscopes are furnished with a revolving diaphragm, with three  holes, of different sizes, to diminish the quantity of light that is  admitted to the object. This instrument is of some use, and offers a  ready means of obtaining a very soft agreeable light for transparent  objects, viewed with low powers. For this purpose cut a circular disk of  India or tissue paper, rather larger than the biggest aperture; scrape a  few little pieces of spermaceti, and place them upon it, then put the  whole on a piece of writing-paper, and hold it a few inches above the  flame of a candle, moving it gently. If this is dexterously done, the  spermaceti will be melted without singeing the paper, and when it is  cold the disk will be found transparent. Place it over the hole in the  diaphragm, send the light through it, and the result will be a very soft  agreeable effect, well suited for many purposes, such as viewing  sections of wood, insects mounted whole, after being rendered  transparent, many small water creatures, etc. Another mode of  accomplishing this purpose is to place a similarly prepared disk of  paper on the flat side of a bull's-eye lens, and transmit the light of a  lamp through it. This plan may be used with higher powers, and the white  opaque light it gives may be directed at any angle by means of the  mirror beneath the stage.    An ordinary lamp may be made to answer for microscopic use, but one of  the small paraffine lamps now sold everywhere for eighteen-pence is  singularly convenient. It is high enough for many purposes, and can  easily be raised by one or more blocks. A paraffine lamp on a sliding  stand is still more handy, and all the better for a hole with a glass  stopper, through which the fluid can be poured.    Many people fancy that the eyes are injured by continual use of the  microscope, but this is far from being the case if reasonable  precautions are taken. The instrument should be inclined at a proper  angle, all excess of light avoided, and the object brought into focus  before it is steadily looked at. Most people solemnly shut one eye  before commencing a microscopic examination; this is a practical and  physiological mistake. Nature meant both eyes to be open, and usually  resents a prolonged violation of her intentions in this matter. It  requires but a little practice to keep both eyes open, and only pay  attention to what is seen by that devoted to the microscope. The  acquisition of this habit is facilitated, and other advantages gained,  by a screen to keep out extraneous light. For this purpose take a piece  of thin cardboard about nine inches square, and cut a round hole in it,  just big enough to admit the tube of the microscope, about two inches  from the bottom, and equidistant from the two sides. Next cut off the  two upper corners of the cardboard, and give them a pleasant-looking  curve. Then cover the cardboard with black velvet, the commonest, which  is not glossy, answers best, and your screen is made. Put the hole over  the tube of the microscope, and let the screen rest on the little ledge  or rim which forms an ornamental finish to most instruments. A piece of  cork may be gummed at the back of the screen, so as to tilt it a little,  and diminish its chance of coming into contact with that important organ  the nose. This little contrivance adds to the clearness and brilliancy  of objects, and is a great accommodation to the eyes.    One more oculistic memorandum, and we have done with this chapter. Do  not stare at portions of objects that are out of focus, and consequently  indistinct, as this injures the eyes more than anything. Remember the  proverb, \"None so deaf as those that won't hear,\" which naturally  suggests for a companion, \"None so blind as those that won't see.\" It is  often impossible to get every object in the field in focus at one  time;--look only at that which is in focus, and be blind to all the  rest. This is a habit easily acquired, and is one for which our  _natural_ microscopes are exceedingly grateful; and every judicious  observer desires to keep on the best terms with his eyes.
