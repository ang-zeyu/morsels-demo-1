The public ain't gonna  forgetcha in a few weeks.\"    But Paul knew far better than the idealistic Ivo how fickle the public  can be. However, he chose an argument that would appeal to the boy.  \"Don't forget, he booby-trapped me!\"    \"Cert'ny looks like it,\" Ivo was forced to concede. \"But watcha gonna  do? Y'can't prove it. 'Sides, the curtain's gonna gwup in a li'l over a  nour--\"    Paul gripped Ivo's sinewy wrist. \"Ivo, you've got to go on for me!\"    \"Y'got rocks in y'head or somepin?\" Ivo demanded, trying not to look  pleased. \"I ain't gotta Nequity card, and even if I did, _he's_  y'unnastudy.\"    \"No, you don't understand. I don't want you to go on as Ivo Darcy  playing Eric Everard. I want you to go on as Paul Lambrequin playing  Eric Everard. _You can do it, Ivo!_\"    \"Good Lord, so I can!\" Ivo whispered, temporarily neglecting to mumble.  \"I'd almost forgotten.\"    \"You know my lines, too. You've cued me in my part often enough.\"    Ivo rubbed his hand over his forehead. \"Yeah, I guess I do.\"    \"Ivo,\" Paul beseeched him, \"I thought we were--pals. I don't want to ask  any favors, but I helped you out when you were in trouble. I always  figured I could rely on you. I never thought you'd let me down.\"    \"An' I won't.\" Ivo gripped Paul's hand. \"I'll go on t'night 'n play 'at  part like it ain't never been played before! I'll--\"    \"No! No! Play it the way I played it. You're supposed to be _me_, Ivo!  Forget Strasberg; go back to Stanislavsky.\"    \"Okay, pal,\" Ivo said. \"Will do.\"    \"And promise me one thing, Ivo. Promise me _you won't mumble_.\"    Ivo winced. \"Okay, but you're the on'y one I'd do 'at for.\"    Slowly, he began to shimmer. Paul held his breath. Maybe Ivo had  forgotten how to transmute himself. But technique triumphed over method.  Ivo Darcy gradually coalesced into the semblance of Paul Lambrequin. The  show would go on!           *       *       *       *       *    \"Well, how was everything?\" Paul asked anxiously when Ivo came into his  room shortly after midnight.    \"Pretty good,\" Ivo said, sitting down on the edge of the bed. \"Gregory  was extremely surprised to see me--asked me half a dozen times how I was  feeling.\" Ivo was not only articulating, Paul was gratified to notice;  he was enunciating.    \"But the show--how did that go? Did anyone suspect you were a ringer?\"    \"No,\" Ivo said slowly. \"No, I don't think so. I got twelve curtain  calls,\" he added, staring straight ahead of him with a dreamy smile.  \"Twelve.\"    \"Friday nights, the audience is always enthusiastic.\" Then Paul  swallowed hard and said, \"Besides, I'm sure you were great in the role.\"    But Ivo didn't seem to hear him. Ivo was still wrapped in his golden  daze. \"Just before the curtain went up, I didn't think I was going to be  able to do it. I began to feel all quivery inside, the way I do before  I--I change.\"    \"Butterflies in the stomach is the professional term.\" Paul nodded  wisely. \"A really good actor gets them before every performance. No  matter how many times I play a role, there's that minute when the house  lights start to dim when I'm in an absolute panic--\"    \"--And then the curtain went up and I was all right. I was fine. I was  Paul Lambrequin. I was Eric Everard. I was--everything.\"    \"Ivo,\" Paul said, clapping him on the shoulder, \"you're a born trouper.\"    \"Yes,\" Ivo murmured, \"I'm beginning to think so myself.\"    For the next four weeks, Paul Lambrequin lurked in his room while Ivo  Darcy played Paul Lambrequin playing Eric Everard.    \"It's terrific of you to take all this time away from your duties, old  chap,\" Paul said to Ivo one day between the matinee and the evening  performances. \"I really do appreciate it. Although I suppose you've  managed to squeeze some of them in. I never see you on non-matinee  afternoons.\"    \"Duties?\" Ivo repeated vacantly. \"Yes, of course--my duties.\"    \"Let me give you some professional advice, though. Be more careful when  you take off your makeup. There's still some grease paint in the roots  of your hair.\"    \"Sloppy of me,\" Ivo agreed, getting to work with a towel.    \"I can't understand why you bother to put on the stuff at all,\" Paul  grinned, \"when all you need to do is just change a little more.\"    \"I know.\" Ivo rubbed his temples vigorously. \"I suppose I just like  the--smell of the stuff.\"    \"Ivo,\" Paul laughed, \"there's no use trying to kid me; you are  stagestruck. I'm sure I have enough pull now to get you a bit part  somewhere, when I'm up and around again, and then you can get yourself  an Equity card. Maybe,\" he added amusedly, \"I can even have you replace  Gregory as my understudy.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Later, in retrospect, Paul thought perhaps there had been a curious  expression in Ivo's eyes, but right then he'd had no inkling that  anything untoward was up. He did not find out what had been at the back  of Ivo's mind until the Sunday before the Tuesday on which he was  planning to resume his role.    \"Lord, it's going to be good to feel that stage under my feet again,\" he  said as he went through a series of complicated limbering-up exercises  of his own devisement, which he had sometimes thought of publishing as  _The Lambrequin Time and Motion Studies_. It seemed unfair to keep them  from other actors.    Ivo turned around from the mirror in which he had been contemplating  their mutual beauty, \"Paul,\" he said quietly, \"you're never going to  feel that stage under your feet again.\"    Paul sat on the floor and stared at him.    \"You see, Paul,\" Ivo said, \"I am Paul Lambrequin now. I am more Paul  Lambrequin than I was--whoever I was on my native planet. I am more Paul  Lambrequin than _you_ ever were. You learned the part superficially,  Paul, but I really _feel_ it.\"    \"It's not a part,\" Paul said querulously. \"It's me. I've always been  Paul Lambrequin.\"    \"How can you be sure of that? You've had so many identities, why should  this be the true one? No, you only _think_ you're Paul Lambrequin. I  _know_ I am.\"    \"Dammit,\" Paul said, \"that's the identity in which I've taken out Equity  membership. And be reasonable, Ivo--there can't be two Paul  Lambrequins.\"    Ivo smiled sadly. \"No, Paul, you're right. There can't.\"    Of course Paul had known all along that Ivo was not a human being. It  was only now, however, that full realization came to him of what a  ruthless alien monster the other was, existing only to gratify his own  purposes, unaware that others had a right to exist.    \"Are--are you going to--dispose of me, then?\" Paul asked faintly.    \"To dispose of you, yes, Paul. But not to kill you. My kind has killed  enough, conquered enough. We have no real population problem; that was  just an excuse we made to salve our own consciences.\"    \"You have consciences, do you?\" Paul's face twisted in a sneer that he  himself sensed right away was overly melodramatic and utterly  unconvincing. Somehow, he could never be really genuine offstage.    Ivo made a sweeping gesture. \"Don't be bitter, Paul. Of course we do.  All intelligent life-forms do. It's one of the penalties of sentience!\"    For a moment, Paul forgot himself. \"Watch it, Ivo. You're beginning to  ham up your lines.\"    \"We can institute birth control,\" Ivo went on, his manner subdued. \"We  can build taller buildings. Oh, there are many ways we can cope with the  population increase. That's not the problem. The problem is how to  divert our creative energies from destruction to construction. And I  think I have solved it.\"    \"How will your people know you have,\" Paul asked cunningly, \"since you  say you're not going back?\"    \"_I_ am not going back to Sirius, Paul--_you_ are. It is you who are  going to teach my people the art of peace to replace the art of war.\"    Paul felt himself turn what was probably a very effective white.  \"But--but I can't even speak the language! I--\"    \"You will learn the language during the journey. I spent those  afternoons I was away making a set of _Sirian-in-a-Jiffy_ records for  you. Sirian's a beautiful language, Paul, much more expressive than any  of your Earth languages. You'll like it.\"    \"I'm sure I shall, but--\"    \"Paul, you are going to bring my people the outlet for self-expression  they have always needed. You see, I lied to you. The theater on Sirius  is not in its infancy; it has never been conceived. If it had been, we  would never have become what we are today. Can you imagine--a race like  mine, so superbly fitted to practice the dramatic art, remaining in  blind ignorance that such an art exists!\"    \"It does seem a terrible waste,\" Paul had to agree, although he could  not be truly sympathetic just then. \"But I am hardly equipped--\"    \"Who is better equipped than you to meet this mighty challenge? Can't  you see that at long last you will be able to achieve your great  synthesis of the theatrical arts--as producer, teacher, director, actor,  playwright, whatever you will, working with a cast of individuals who  can assume any shape or form, who have no preconceived notions of what  can be done and what cannot. Oh, Paul, what a glorious opportunity  awaits you on Sirius V. How I envy you!\"    \"Then why don't you do it yourself?\" Paul asked.    Ivo smiled sadly again. \"Unfortunately, I do not have your manifold  abilities. All I can do is act. Superbly, of course, but that's all. I  don't have the capacity to build a living theater from scratch. You do.  I have talent, Paul, but you have genius.\"    \"It _is_ a temptation,\" Paul admitted. \"But to leave my own world....\"    \"Paul, Earth isn't your world. You carry yours along with you wherever  you go. Your world exists in the mind and heart, not in reality. In any  real situation, you're just as uncomfortable on Earth as you would be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#3)"],[1,"             (page 231)                                     NOTES                               (page 241)                                     INDEX                               (page 261)                                INTRODUCTION    A people honors itself in honoring the great men who have  interpreted its thought, who are the guardians of its genius.  It  thus renders merited homage and pays just tribute to those who  have increased the treasures of its civilization and added a new  feature to its moral physiognomy; it establishes the union of  ideas that assures the conservation of the national genius, and  maintains and perpetuates the consciousness of the nation.  Finally, it manifests consciousness of its future in taking  cognizance of its past, and in turning over the leaves of its  archives, it defines its part and mission in history.  The study  of men and facts in the past permits of a sounder appreciation of  recent efforts, of present tendencies; for \"humanity is always  composed of more dead than living,\" and usually \"the past is what  is most vital in the present.\"    No people has greater need than the Jews to steep itself again in  the sources of its existence, and no period more than the present  imposes upon it the duty of bringing its past back to life.  Scattered over the face of the globe, no longer constituting a  body politic, the Jewish people by cultivating its intellectual  patrimony creates for itself an ideal fatherland; and mingled, as  it is, with its neighbors, threatened by absorption into  surrounding nations, it recovers a sort of individuality by the  reverence it pays to men that have given best expression to its  peculiar genius.    But the Jewish people, its national life crushed out of it,  though deprived of all political ambitions, has yet regained a  certain national solidarity through community of faith and  ideals; and it has maintained the cohesion of its framework by  the wholly spiritual bonds of teaching and charity.  This is the  picture it presents throughout the middle ages, during the period  which, for Christianity, marked an eclipse of the intellect and,  as it were, an enfeeblement of the reason to such a degree that  the term middle ages becomes synonymous with intellectual  decadence.  \"But,\" said the historian Graetz, \"while the sword  was ravaging the outer world, and the people devoted themselves  to murderous strife, the house of Jacob cared only that the light  of the mind burn on steadily and that the shadows of darkness be  dissipated.  If a religion may be judged by its principal  representatives, the palm must be awarded to Judaism in the tenth  to the thirteenth century.\"  Its scholars, therefore, its  philosophers, and its poets render Judaism illustrious, and by  their works and their renown shed a radiant light upon its  history.    Maimonides is one of those eminent spirits in whom was reflected  the genius of the Jewish people and who have in turn contributed  to the development of its genius.[1]  Maimonides, however, was  also more than this; perhaps he presents as much of interest from  the point of view of Arabic as of Jewish culture; and expressing  more than the Jewish ideal, he does not belong to the Jews  entirely.  Of Rashi, on the contrary, one may say that he is a  Jew to the exclusion of everything else.  He is no more than a  Jew, no other than a Jew.                                   BOOK I                            RASHI THE MAN                                 -------                                CHAPTER I                        THE JEWS OF FRANCE IN THE                          ELEVENTH CENTURY    Great men - and Rashi, as we shall see, may be counted among  their number - arrive at opportune times.  Sometimes we  congratulate them for having disappeared from history in good  season; it would be just as reasonable, or, rather, just as  unreasonable, to be grateful to them for having come at exactly  the right juncture of affairs.  The great man, in fact, is the  man of the moment; he comes neither too soon, which spares him  from fumbling over beginnings and so clogging his own footsteps,  nor too late, which prevents him from imitating a model and so  impeding the development of his personality.  He is neither a  precursor nor an epigone, neither a forerunner nor a late-comer.  He neither breaks the ground nor gleans the harvest: he is the  sower who casts the seed upon a field ready to receive it and  make it grow.    It is, therefore, of some avail for us to devote several pages to  the history of the Jews of Northern France in the eleventh  century, especially in regard to their intellectual state and  more especially in regard to their rabbinical culture.  If  another reason were needed to justify this preamble, I might  invoke a principle long ago formulated and put to the test by  criticism, namely, that environment is an essential factor in the  make-up of a writer, and an intellectual work is always  determined, conditioned by existing circumstances.  The principle  applies to Rashi, of whom one may say, of whom in fact Zunz has  said, he is the representative <I>par excellence</I> of his time  and of his circle.           *       *       *       *       *    In the great migratory movement beginning at the dawn of the  Christian era, which scattered the Jews to the four corners of  the globe, and which was accentuated and precipitated by the  misfortunes that broke over the population of Palestine, France,  or, more exactly, Gaul, was colonized by numbers of Jews.  If we  believe in the right of the first occupant, we ought to consider  the French Jews more French than many Frenchmen.  Conversions  must at first have been numerous, and the number of apostates  kept pace with the progress of Christianity.    In the south of France, there were Jewish communities before the  fifth century; in Burgundy and Touraine, in the first half of the  sixth century; and in Austrasia, at the end of the same century.  From the Provence, they ascended the Rhone and the Saone.  Others  reached Guienne and Anjou.[2]    Although disturbed at times by the canons of various distrustful  Church councils, or by the sermons of a few vehement bishops, the  Jews on the whole led a peaceful, though not a very prosperous,  existence, which has left scarcely any traces in history and  literature.  Aside from a few unimportant names and facts, these  centuries mark a gap in the history of the Jews of France, as in  that of their Christian neighbors; and literature, as it always  does, followed the political and economic destinies of the  nation.  From the fifth to the tenth century, letters fell into  utter decay, despite the momentary stimulus given by Charlemagne.  The human intellect, to borrow from Guizot, had reached the nadir  of its course.  This epoch, however, was not entirely lost to  civilization.  The Jews applied themselves to studies, the taste  for which developed more and more strongly.  If as yet they could  not fly with their own wings, they remained in relation with the  centres [centers sic] of rabbinical life, the academies in  Babylonia, exchanging the products of the mind at the same time  that they bartered merchandise.  This slow process of incubation  was perforce fruitful of results.                                    I    It was in the tenth century, when the political and social  troubles that had agitated Europe since the fall of the Roman  Empire were calmed, that the Jews came forth from their semi-  obscurity, either because their numbers had increased, or because  their position had become more stable, or because they were  ready, after mature preparation, to play their part in the  intellectual world.    At this time, the Jews of Northern France nearly without  exception enjoyed happy conditions of existence.  From their  literature, rather scholarly than popular, we learn chiefly of  their schools and their rabbis; yet we also learn from it that  their employments were the same as those of the other inhabitants  of the country.  They were engaged in trade, many attaining  wealth; and a number devoted themselves to agriculture.  They  possessed fields and vineyards, for neither the ownership of land  nor residence in the country was forbidden them; and they were  also employed in cattle raising.  Often they took Christians into  their service.    But the Jews, although they attached themselves to the soil and  tried to take root there, were essentially an urban population.  They owned real estate and devoted themselves to all sorts of  industries.  They were allowed to be workmen and to practice every  handicraft, inasmuch as the guilds, those associations, partly  religious in character, which excluded the Jews from their  membership rolls, did not begin to be established until the  twelfth century.  Sometimes a Jew was entrusted with a public  office, as a rule that of collector of taxes.  Not until later,  about the twelfth century, when forced by men and circumstances,  did the Jews make a specialty of moneylending.    The strength of the Jews resided in the fact that they were  organized in communities, which were marked by intense  solidarity, and in which harmony and tranquillity [tranquility  sic] were assured by the rabbinical institutions.  Failure to  respect these institutions was punished by excommunication-a  severe penalty, for the excommunicated man encountered the hate  of his co-religionists and was driven to baptism.[3]    At the head of the communities were provosts (<I>praepositi</I>),  charged with surveillance over their interests, and doubtless  their representatives before the civil authority.  Many Jews were  highly esteemed by the kings or seigneurs, holding positions of  honor and bearing honorific titles; but in general the Jews of  France, unlike those of Spain, were not permitted to take part in  the government, or even have a share in the political life of the  nation."]]]
