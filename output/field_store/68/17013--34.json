From this point men migrated in  every direction. Here, in Asia, their language and religion, if they had  any, would be one and the same. This would, in the nature of the case,  be true, whether religion was at first human or Divine. Again, as all  derivative languages are found to be shaded by one primitive language,  so all derivative religions will, on examination, be found to be shaded  by the one primitive religion. That is, the leading or fundamental idea  will be found more or less unclouded in all the more modern religions.  Now, which is it that shades all religions? Is it Polytheism or  Monotheism? Is the fundamental thought of either found in all the  others? Will any one pretend that Polytheism is the primitive religion?  Is its leading thought of many gods, found in all religions? It is not  in Judaism, Christianity, nor Mahomedanism. These are one in their  advocacy of one living and true God. This fact breaks the chain of  Polytheism and ruins its claim to be considered the first religion. Here  we must leave Polytheism and look after the claim of Monotheism. If this  is the first form of religion, it must, according to our rule, shade all  other religions; if it does not, then, from this stand-point all is yet  in the dark.      MONOTHEISM TESTED.    In all time past it has been conceded that the maxim, \"_vox populi, vox  dei_,\" is true when taken in its broad or universal sense. \"We are apt  to attribute that to be true which all men presume. It is an argument  with us that anything which seems true to all, as that there are gods,  shows that they have engrafted in them an opinion concerning gods,  neither is there any so void of laws or good manners that doth not  believe that there are some gods.\"--Sen. Epist. C. 17. \"This seems a  firm thing which is alleged why we should believe gods to be, because no  nation is so fierce, no man so wild, whose mind has not been imbued with  an opinion concerning gods, or that uses proceed from bad customs. But  all do however conceive a _Divine power_ and nature to exist. Now, in  all things, the consent of all nations is supposed to be the law of  nature.\"--Cicero, Tusc., q. 1, p. 299. \"In such a quarreling and tumult  and gangling, you may see this one thing by common consent, acknowledged  law and speech, that there is _one God, the king and father of all, and  many gods the children of God_. This the Greek says; and this the  Barbarian says; the inhabitant of the continent and the Islander, the  wise and the unwise do say the same.\"--Max. Tyn., Dis. 1, p. 5. \"It is  an ancient saying and running in the race of all men, that from God were  all things, and by him all things were constituted, and do  consist.\"--Demundo (dedicated to Alexander), cap. 6. Here I rest, not  for want of more witnesses, for the testimony of all antiquity is full  on this point. There is not an ancient tribe, race, or nation, of which  we have any information, historic or traditional, who did not  acknowledge the existence of _one Supreme Being_. In this the chain is  unbroken, so Monotheism must have been the first religion. The chain of  Polytheism is broken many times. All nations did not acknowledge the  existence of many gods. Indeed, no nation of antiquity acknowledged a  plurality of supreme gods, while all nations acknowledged a _Supreme  God_, who, with them, was the father of gods and men. So in this way  the chain was always broken, _never whole_. Polytheism then could not,  in the very nature of things, be the original religion with Monotheism  engrafted upon it. Simple Polytheism never existed with any nation; it  always displayed a supreme head, a Supreme God--father of gods and men.  And even this form of Polytheism was acknowledged by a part of our race  only. The idea is worthy of being repeated, that all nations of men  throughout all antiquity acknowledged one living and true supreme and  master God presiding over all gods and men. This idea lies at the  foundation of all ancient Polytheism, and most certainly at the  foundation of all ancient Monotheism. Now, as religion simply consists  primarily in man's relation to God, with the accessory idea of  dependence upon and obligation to him, the question is: Was that  religion earthly or Divine in its origin? Were these thoughts the  thoughts of men only, or were they too high for us? Can you think of  your relation and obligation to a being of whom you have never heard or  learned? No. Neither could man in the beginning, nor at any subsequent  time. Religion came not from earth. Human genius was not and could not  have been its foundation. There is but one other possible source, which  is simply the will and teachings of the creator. Religion is unearthly,  and hence Divine in its origin. The stream always declares the nature of  the fountain.    Gentlemen skeptics, you boast of free and fearless thought. Make your  vaunting good. Examine, if you dare, and let us have your strong  reasons, if you have any.    The nature of man made revelation a necessity. This will be the theme of  my next. Truth never fears the light, but known error is a coward, and  loves the dark.          *      *      *      *      *    A NOBLE book! All men's book. It is our first statement of the  never-ending problem of man's destiny and God's ways with men on  earth.--_Carlyle._          FORCE AND LIFE.    DR. J.L. PARSONS.      The origin of force and life in the universe is a great puzzle to  materialistic scientists. In the azoic period of our earth there was no  life on it. The living creatures now on the earth must, therefore, have  had some origin. That origin is not due to spontaneous generation,  according to the testimony of the most enlightened scientists, Professor  Haeckel to the contrary notwithstanding. The various vital  manifestations and exhibitions of force in the universe are due to some  cause. The intuitions of mankind, as well as the teachings of science,  declare there must be a cause lying behind the universe which has  produced it.    Two great philosophies contend for the mastery in the solution of the  problem of life. Materialistic philosophy seeks to account for the  origin of all things on principles which deny the existence of God, the  Creator, and which make man wholly a material being. Christianity  declares that the God of the Bible is behind the universe as its cause.  The only things which materialists recognize as having any existence in  the universe are matter and force. If force be used in the sense of mind  or spirit, which it is not in this case, I have no objection to this  statement. One of the first elementary lessons in material philosophy is  the _inertia_ of matter. Being at rest matter has no power to set itself  in motion. Being in motion it has no power to put itself at rest. It is  moved by a force which is in no sense an attribute of matter. Since the  earth is in motion and teems with life, that motion and life must be due  to force, which is the only remaining existence in the universe. As a  cause lying behind the universe, this force is denominated the unknown  force.    Prior to and in the azoic age we have nothing in the universe but matter  and force, and according to Mr. Spencer, not only an unknown force, but  also an unseen and an unknowable force. Subsequent to the azoic period  and now we have the earth full of life, intelligence and religion due  to the unknown force. This unknown, unseen and unknowable force may be  studied in the light of its manifestations and effects, Mr. Spencer to  the contrary notwithstanding. Since all effects are contained in their  causes, the universe as an effect must have been and must be contained  in the great unknown force as its cause. The characteristics which mark  the effect must mark the cause also. If the stream be fresh water, the  fountain which sends it forth must be fresh water also; for the stream  is contained in the fountain. If there be no fountain there can be no  stream. If there be no cause there can be no effect. If there be no  involution there can be no evolution. The stream can not rise higher  than its fountain. The universe now contains life. The unknown force  must also contain life; for all effects are contained in their causes.  The universe has in it mind. The unknown force must have mind; for all  effects are contained in their causes. The universe has in it goodness  and religion. So must the unknown force possess goodness and religion;  for all effects are contained in their causes. The unknown cause of all  things must possess mind, intelligence, goodness, holiness, else these  things could not have proceeded from the unknown cause. \"_Ex nihilo  nihil fit_\" is still true. But life, mind, energy, holiness, are  attributes of the God of the Bible. Whenever science divests the unknown  force of these attributes which characterize Jehovah, she has left a  cause wholly inadequate to the production of the universe. Whenever she  invests the unknown force with life, power, intelligence and goodness,  she has set up the God of the Bible.    Again, man is possessed of a mind and a religious element in his nature.  If man's origin be due to the monkey or the tadpole, then the monkey or  the tadpole must have a mind and a religious nature; for all effects are  contained in their causes. The monkey must have a mind superior to that  of Newton's, and the tadpole must be more religious than man; for the  stream can not rise higher than its fountain!    Man has a religious element in his nature. That element seeks to be  satisfied religiously, as the eye instinctively seeks for light, the  ear for sound, or the body for food. Until the constitutional elements  of man's nature are changed, he will instinctively seek for a God  capable of satisfying this element of his being. This part of man is  satisfied in the Bible and in the God of the Bible. Hence I conclude  that the race as a race will never "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28678"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#3)"],[1,". In other words,  it depends on ourselves whether we will act from one motive or another.    Action from motive always begins in ourselves. And if conversion is the  result of motive power, it begins in ourselves and by ourselves. Let a  man be tempted to steal, his motive is the love of money. But _if he_  refrains from the deed, his motive is a regard for duty. If he suffers  himself to be governed by the first, he is a thief and deserves  punishment, but if he allows himself to be governed by the second, he  has done well. The laws of every country suppose that men have it in  their power to give to either motive that regard which will determine  their conduct. The divine laws allow the same, placing motives high as  heaven before sinners for their acceptance, and warning them with  restraining threats deep as hell. And if sinners will not receive these  threats and act accordingly, they are without excuse. The scriptures  allow that men convert from God. How is this? Have men power to cross  the chasm backwards, and are not able, at the same time to cross it in a  forward movement? Strange logic, this! It is the same old philosophy  that sinners have the power to go to hell, but none to get to heaven;  that they are free, like the slave, to do the tyrant's bidding; that  they are free like the water that stands in the pool; that they are  mechanically free, are simply active when wrought upon, the same as any  machinery. If this be so, why is it that so many are left in an  unconverted state? Is it because the good Spirit prefers the existence  of iniquity and crime? If the Lord brings about the salvation of some,  through a mighty outpouring of his Spirit, then we shall never  comprehend his ways. Why is it that he does not give us one general  outpouring, one grand revival all over our country, and bring about the  long prayed for millennial day? Answer.--Conversion is a commandment of  God. It must be obeyed or the country lie, in direct opposition to the  will of God, in sin. His will is expressed in the words, \"Let the wicked  forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him  return, _reconvert_, unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and  to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\"    \"To Israel he saith, all the day long have I stretched forth my hands  unto a gainsaying and disobedient people.\" Ro. x, 21. \"The Lord strove  with them by his Spirit in the prophets, and bore with them many years,  yet they would not hear.\" Nehe. ix, 30. \"They made their hearts as an  adamant stone lest they should hear the law, and the words which the  Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets.\" Zech.  vii, 12. Jesus wept over them when he stood upon Mount Olivet and  expressed the greatness of his great heart in these words: \"How often  would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her  brood under her wings, and ye would not.\" Lu. xiii, 34. Their failure  was not because the Spirit did not strive with them as it did with  others who were saved. \"God is no respecter of persons.\" Neither was it  on account of inborn depravity. For if any were corrupted in their moral  nature by Adam's sin, all were corrupted alike. So that each one would  be in this respect equally hard to overcome. But why bring up inborn  corruption and helplessness? Is not the Spirit of God able for any task  which is in its own line of work? Jesus gave the true solution of the  question. He said: \"Their hearts have waxed gross, and their ears are  dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at _any time_  they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and  understand with their hearts and be converted, and I should heal them.\"  The words \"at any time\" deserve particular attention, for the Lord's  time is _all the time_. He is unchangeable. \"He is not willing that any  should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\" 2 Pet. iii, 9.    Many people talk and act as though the Lord was the most changeable  being in the universe. They seem to think that the unchangeableness of  the Lord is in the idea that he is everlastingly changing. Let us  imagine a perfect circle with a stone permanently fixed in the center  and a man walking within, and every move he makes from side to side  affecting his relations to the center. So it is with God and the  children of men. He is immutable. He is the center of the circle. In the  right hand side of this circle are the innocent and the obedient, in the  enjoyment of all its riches, peace, pardon and all spiritual blessings.  These blessings were provided for all men, and presented in the gospel  of peace; and in the left side of this circle are all the threatenings  of God and all the wickedness and miseries of men. The wicked at the  left are able to _convert_ around to the right. In doing this they leave  their sins and miseries and come around where all the blessings of the  great salvation have always been, are, and will be until time is no  more. In all the work of human redemption there is no place for change  in God. The center has never changed. Man _alone_ changes. God has not  bestowed _special_ pardoning grace. Such phraseology is unknown in the  gospel. \"His grace was given us in Jesus Christ before the world began.\"  2 Tim. i, 9. All that we or any others have to do is to live on the  Christ side of this circle--the right hand. If we are sinners it is our  duty to convert around to the right into new relations containing all  that is grand, glorious and desirable. The sinner, led by the motives of  the gospel, changes sides; leaving the kingdom of darkness upon the  left, and crossing the line drawn through the center of the circle, he  passes into the kingdom of light. It seems strange that intelligent men  and women should be constantly throwing mystery around a matter that is  so plain and simple. But we are aware that, by long dwelling on an idea,  and from the excited and abnormal sensitiveness of the mind, we  sometimes lose ourselves to truth amidst our own creations, which become  in the imagination stern realities, producing a species of monomania or  religious insanity.    Long dwelling upon the idea that conversion is a special work of God  destroys all disposition _to convert_, and causes men to be at ease in  disobedience. We will to do those things, and those only, which we  believe to be in our power. We are not so destitute of common sense as  to undertake that which we know to be out of our power. I never attempt  to fly, or raise a weight that I know to be far above my strength. So it  is in the question of conversion. If I believe it to be a work that is  beyond my power, there will be a corresponding indifference upon my  part. As long as men are made to believe that God must convert them by a  special interposition of his Spirit, so long their minds will be  directed, beyond the plain duties of the gospel, to the realm of the  mysterious and incomprehensible. In ancient times, when men were plainly  told to convert--_turn_--to God and do works worthy of repentance, when  the mists and mysticles of the schoolmen and dogmatists of all sects and  parties had not, as yet, beclouded the minds of men, nor corrupted the  simplicity of the Gospel, thousands were converted in a day.  Christianity overran the inhabited earth in the space of a few years.  Judaism and Paganism trembled and crumbled before its mighty power. But  now the religious world is contending with sin and crime, under the  great disadvantages of a perverted mind and a Gospel beclouded with the  smoke of Babylon, and the result is that three-score souls brought into  the church is a great success for the labors of weeks, and even months.  Why should this be so? It need not be. It would not be but for the wrong  teaching consequent upon creeds. It is said, \"That many of the  Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.\" Their minds were clear  upon the great subjects of human duty and the goodness, love and mercy  of God. They had no long sessions, in which they were wrestling with God  as though he was insensitive and indifferent upon the subject of the  sinner's salvation.    They were told the story of God's love, and made acquainted with the  great fact that all things were ready for their reception; \"that Christ  had finished the work which the Father had given him to do,\" and that it  only remained for them to believe and obey the Gospel and all would be  well. They were commanded _to convert_ to the service of God. This work  was not given into the hands of Christ to perform. It is the sinner's  own work. Christ will not believe for you. He will not repent for you.  He will not convert for you. Conversion is the overt action of the will  carried out in \"breaking off from sins by righteousness.\" It begins in  the heart, but it does not end there. Murder begins in the heart, but  its consummation is the action of the will carried out. The man first  yielded to the temptation by saying, in his heart, I will. The next  thing in the order was carrying out the will in the deed. Nothing short  of the deed done would have met the statement in the heart, _I will_. So  it is in conversion. The man first says in his heart, _I will_, I will  forsake my former course of life and be a Christian, I will obey God, I  will do his will. And nothing short of doing the will of God as it is  addressed to him in the Gospel will carry out the action of the will,  and meet the demands of the statement, _I will_. \"Whosoever will let him  come and take the water of life freely.\" So the \"tree is known by its  fruits.\" \"He that saith I know him, acknowledge him, and keepeth not his  commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" 1 Jno. ii, 4.    As regards the instrumentalities employed in persuading men, I have only  to say, that men were always free as moral agents, to convert--_turn_,  under the weakest instrumentality, or refuse"]]]
