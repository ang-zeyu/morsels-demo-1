For my part I had rather be again  present, were it possible, in that famous battle, than whole and sound  without sharing ill the glory of it. The scars which a soldier  exhibits in his breast and face are stars to guide others to the haven  of honour and the love of just praise.\"    The year following the victory of Lepanto, Cervantes still continued  with the same fleet, and took part in several attacks on the coast of  the Morea. At the end of 1572, when the allied forces were disbanded,  Colonna returned to Rome, whither our author probably accompanied him,  since he tells us that he followed his \"conquering banners.\" He  afterwards enlisted in the Neapolitan army of the king of Spain, in  which he remained for three years, though without rising above the  rank of a private soldier; but it must be remembered that, at the time  of which we are now speaking, such was the condition of some of the  noblest men of their country; it was accounted no disgrace for even a  scion of the nobility to fight as a simple halberdier, or musqueteer,  in the service of his prince.    On the 26th of September, 1575, Cervantes embarked on board a galley,  called the 'Sun,' and was sailing from Naples to Spain, when his ship  was attacked by some Moorish corsairs, and both he and all the rest of  the crew were taken prisoners, and carried off to Algiers. When the  Christians were divided amongst their captors, he fell to the lot of  the captain, the famous Arnaute Mami, an Albanian renegade, whose  atrocious cruelties are too disgusting to be mentioned. He seems to  have treated his captive with peculiar harshness, perhaps hoping that  by so doing he might render him the more impatient of his servitude,  and so induce him to pay a higher ransom, which the rank and condition  of his friends in Europe appeared to promise. In this state Cervantes  continued five years. Some have thought that in \"the captive's\" tale,  related in Don Quixote, we may collect the particulars of his own  fortunes whilst in Africa; but even granting that some of the  incidents may be the same, it is now generally supposed that we shall  be deceived if we regard them as any detailed account of his  captivity. A man of Cervantes' enterprise and abilities was not likely  to endure tamely the hardships of slavery; and we accordingly find  that he was constantly forming schemes for escape. The last of these,  which was the most bold and best contrived of all, failed, because he  had admitted a traitor to a share in his project.    There was at Algiers a Venetian renegade, named Hassan Aga, a friend  of Arnaute Mami; he had risen high in the king's favour, and occupied  an important post in the government of Algiers. We have a description  of this man's ferocious character in Don Quixote, given us by the  Captain de Viedma. Cervantes was often sent by his master as messenger  to this man's house, situated on the sea-shore, at a short distance  from Algiers. One of Hassan's slaves, a native of Navarre, and a  Christian, had the management of the gardens of the villa; and with  him Cervantes soon formed an acquaintance, and succeeded in  persuading him to allow the making of a secret cave under the garden,  which would form a place of concealment for himself and fifteen of his  fellow captives, on whom he could rely. When the cavern was finished,  the adventurers made their escape by night from Algiers, and took up  their quarters in it. Of course an alarm was raised when they were  missing; but, although a most strict search after the fugitives was  made, both by their masters and by Ochali, then despot of Algiers,  here they lay hid for several months, being supplied with food by the  gardener and another Christian slave, named El Dorador.    One of their companions, named Viana, a gentleman of Minorca, had been  left behind them, so that he might bear a more active part in the  escape of the whole party. A sum of money was to be raised for his  ransom, and then he was to go to Europe and return with a ship in  which Cervantes and his friends, including the gardener and El  Dorador, were to embark on an appointed night, and so get back to  their country. Viana obtained his liberty in September 1577, and  having reached Minorca in safety, he easily procured a ship and came  off the coast of Barbary, according to the pre-concerted plan; but  before he could land, he was seen by the Moorish sentry, who raised an  alarm and obliged him to put out to sea again, lest he should by  coming too close attract attention to the cavern. This was a sore  disappointment to Cervantes and his companions, who witnessed it all  from their retreat. Still knowing Viana's courage and constancy, they  had yet hopes of his returning and again endeavouring to get them off.  And this he most probably would have done had it not been for the  treachery at which we hinted above. El Dorador just at this time  thought fit to turn renegade; and of course he could not begin his  infidel career better than by infamously betraying his former friends.  In consequence of his information Hassan Aga surrounded the entrance  to the cave with a sufficient force to make any attempt at resistance  utterly unavailing, and the sixteen poor prisoners were dragged out  and conveyed in chains to Algiers. The former attempts which he made  to escape caused Cervantes to be instantly fixed on as the contriver  and ringleader of this plot; and therefore, whilst the other fifteen  were sent back to their masters to be punished as they thought fit, he  was detained by the king himself, who hoped through him to obtain  further information, and so implicate the other Christians, and  perhaps also some of the renegades. Even had he possessed any such  information, which most likely he did not, Cervantes was certainly the  very last man to give it: notwithstanding various examinations and  threats, he still persisted in asserting that he was the sole  contriver of the plot, till at length, by his firmness, he fairly  exhausted the patience of Ochali. Had Hassan had his way, Cervantes  would have been strangled as an example to all Christians who should  hereafter try to run away from their captivity, and the king himself  was not unwilling to please him in this matter; but then he was not  their property, and Mami, to whom he belonged, would not consent to  lose a slave whom he considered to be worth at least two hundred  crowns. Thus did the avarice of a renegade save the future author of  Don Quixote from being strangled with the bowstring. Some of the  particulars of this affair are given us by Cervantes himself; but  others are collected from Father Haedo, the contemporary author of a  history of Barbary. \"Most wonderful thing,\" says the worthy priest,  \"that some of these gentlemen remained shut up in the cavern for five,  six, even for seven months, without even so much as seeing the light  of day; and all the time they were sustained only by Miguel de  Cervantes, and that too at the great and continual risk of his own  life; no less than four times did he incur the nearest danger of being  burnt alive, impaled, or strangled, on account of the bold things  which he dared in hopes of bestowing liberty upon many. Had his  fortune corresponded to his spirit, skill, and industry, Algiers might  at this day have been in the possession of the Christians, for his  designs aspired to no less lofty a consummation. In the end, the whole  affair was treacherously discovered; and the gardener, after being  tortured and picketed, perished miserably. But, in truth, of the  things which happened in that cave during the seven months that it was  inhabited by these Christians, and altogether of the captivity and  various enterprises of Miguel de Cervantes, a particular history might  easily be formed. Hassan Aga was wont to say that, '_could he but be  sure of that handless Spaniard_, he should consider captives, barks,  and the whole city of Algiers in perfect safety.'\"    And Ochali seems to have been of the same opinion; for he did not  consider it safe to leave so dangerous a character as Cervantes in  private hands, and so we accordingly find that he himself bought him  of Mami, and then kept him closely confined in a dungeon in his own  palace, with the utmost cruelty. It is probable, however, that the  extreme hardship of Cervantes' case did really contribute to his  liberation. He found means of applying to Spain for his redemption;  and in consequence his mother and sister (the former of whom had now  become a widow, and the latter, Donna Andrea de Cervantes, was married  to a Florentine gentleman named Ambrosio) raised the sum of two  hundred and fifty crowns, to which a friend of the family, one  Francisco Caramambel, contributed fifty more. This sum was paid into  the hands of Father Juan Gil and Father Antonio de la Vella  Trinitarios, brethren of the 'Society for the Redemption of  Slaves,'[1] who immediately set to work to ransom Cervantes. His case  was, however, a hard one; for the king asked a thousand crowns for his  freedom; and the negotiation on this head caused a long delay, but was  at last brought to an issue by the abatement of the ransom to the sum  of five hundred crowns; the two hundred still wanting were made up by  the good fathers, the king threatening that if the bargain were not  concluded, Cervantes should be carried off to Constantinople; and he  was actually on board the galley for that purpose. So by borrowing  some part of the required amount, and by taking the remainder from  what was originally intrusted for the ransoming of other slaves, these  worthy men procured our author his liberty, and restored him to Spain  in the spring of 1581.

Locke, Hume, and Holbach in  the eighteenth. Such will be your lot! Do now what you will, set type in  a printing-office, bring up children, bury yourself in deep seclusion,  seek obscure and lonely villages, it is all one to me; you cannot escape  your destiny; you cannot divest yourself of your noblest feature, that  active, strong, and inquiring mind, with which you are endowed; your  place in the world has been appointed, and it cannot remain empty. Go  where you please, I expect you in Paris, talking philosophy and the  doctrines of Plato; you will have to come, whether you want to or not.  I, who say this to you, must feel very sure of it in order to be willing  to put it upon paper, since, without reward for my prophetic skill,--to  which, I assure you, I make not the slightest claim,--I run the risk of  passing for a hare-brained fellow, in case I prove to be mistaken: he  plays a bold game who risks his good sense upon his cards, in return  for the very trifling and insignificant merit of having divined a young  man's future.    \"When I say that I expect you in Paris, I use only a proverbial phrase  which you must not allow to mislead you as to my projects and plans.  To reside in Paris is disagreeable to me, very much so; and when this  fine-art fever which possesses me has left me, I shall abandon the place  without regret to seek a more peaceful residence in a provincial town,  provided always the town shall afford me the means of living, bread, a  bed, books, rest, and solitude. How I miss, my good Proudhon, that dark,  obscure, smoky chamber in which I dwelt in Besancon, and where we spent  so many pleasant hours in the discussion of philosophy! Do you remember  it? But that is now far away. Will that happy time ever return? Shall  we one day meet again? Here my life is restless, uncertain, precarious,  and, what is worse, indolent, illiterate, and vagrant. I do no work, I  live in idleness, I ramble about; I do not read, I no longer study; my  books are forsaken; now and then I glance over a few metaphysical works,  and after a days walk through dirty, filthy, crowded streets. I lie  down with empty head and tired body, to repeat the performance on the  following day. What is the object of these walks, you will ask. I make  visits, my friend; I hold interviews with stupid people. Then a fit of  curiosity seizes me, the least inquisitive of beings: there are museums,  libraries, assemblies, churches, palaces, gardens, and theatres to  visit. I am fond of pictures, fond of music, fond of sculpture; all  these are beautiful and good, but they cannot appease hunger, nor take  the place of my pleasant readings of Bailly, Hume, and Tennemann, which  I used to enjoy by my fireside when I was able to read.    \"But enough of complaints. Do not allow this letter to affect you too  much, and do not think that I give way to dejection or despondency; no,  I am a fatalist, and I believe in my star. I do not know yet what my  calling is, nor for what branch of polite literature I am best fitted;  I do not even know whether I am, or ever shall be, fitted for any: but  what matters it? I suffer, I labor, I dream, I enjoy, I think; and, in a  word, when my last hour strikes, I shall have lived.    \"Proudhon, I love you, I esteem you; and, believe me, these are not mere  phrases. What interest could I have in flattering and praising a poor  printer? Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers? Have you a  sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in order to  attract them to your suite? Have you the glory, honors, credit, which  would render your acquaintance pleasing to their vanity and pride? No;  you are poor, obscure, abandoned; but, poor, obscure, and abandoned,  you have a friend, and a friend who knows all the obligations which that  word imposes upon honorable people, when they venture to assume it. That  friend is myself: put me to the test.    \"GUSTAVE FALLOT.\"      It appears from this letter that if, at this period, Proudhon had  already exhibited to the eyes of a clairvoyant friend his genius for  research and investigation, it was in the direction of philosophical,  rather than of economical and social, questions.    Having become foreman in the house of Gauthier & Co., who carried on  a large printing establishment at Besancon, he corrected the proofs of  ecclesiastical writers, the Fathers of the Church. As they were printing  a Bible, a Vulgate, he was led to compare the Latin with the original  Hebrew.      \"In this way,\" says Sainte Beuve, \"he learned Hebrew by himself, and,  as everything was connected in his mind, he was led to the study of  comparative philology. As the house of Gauthier published many works  on Church history and theology, he came also to acquire, through this  desire of his to investigate everything, an extensive knowledge of  theology, which afterwards caused misinformed persons to think that he  had been in an ecclesiastical seminary.\"      Towards 1836, Proudhon left the house of Gauthier, and, in company  with an associate, established a small printing-office in Besancon. His  contribution to the partnership consisted, not so much in capital, as  in his knowledge of the trade. His partner committing suicide in 1838,  Proudhon was obliged to wind up the business, an operation which he did  not accomplish as quickly and as easily as he hoped. He was then urged  by his friends to enter the ranks of the competitors for the Suard  pension. This pension consisted of an income of fifteen hundred francs  bequeathed to the Academy of Besancon by Madame Suard, the widow of the  academician, to be given once in three years to the young man residing  in the department of Doubs, a bachelor of letters or of science, and  not possessing a fortune, whom the Academy of Besancon SHOULD DEEM BEST  FITTED FOR A LITERARY OR SCIENTIFIC CAREER, OR FOR THE STUDY OF LAW  OR OF MEDICINE. The first to win the Suard pension was Gustave Fallot.  Mauvais, who was a distinguished astronomer in the Academy of Sciences,  was the second. Proudhon aspired to be the third. To qualify himself, he  had to be received as a bachelor of letters, and was obliged to write a  letter to the Academy of Besancon. In a phrase of this letter, the terms  of which he had to modify, though he absolutely refused to change  its spirit, Proudhon expressed his firm resolve to labor for the  amelioration of the condition of his brothers, the working-men.    The only thing which he had then published was an \"Essay on General  Grammar,\" which appeared without the author's signature. While  reprinting, at Besancon, the \"Primitive Elements of Languages,  Discovered by the Comparison of Hebrew roots with those of the Latin and  French,\" by the Abbe Bergier, Proudhon had enlarged the edition of his  \"Essay on General Grammar.\"    The date of the edition, 1837, proves that he did not at that time think  of competing for the Suard pension. In this work, which continued and  completed that of the Abbe Bergier, Proudhon adopted the same point  of view, that of Moses and of Biblical tradition. Two years later, in  February, 1839, being already in possession of the Suard pension, he  addressed to the Institute, as a competitor for the Volney prize,  a memoir entitled: \"Studies in Grammatical Classification and the  Derivation of some French words.\" It was his first work, revised and  presented in another form. Four memoirs only were sent to the Institute,  none of which gained the prize. Two honorable mentions were granted,  one of them to memoir No. 4; that is, to P. J. Proudhon, printer at  Besancon. The judges were MM. Amedde Jaubert, Reinaud, and Burnouf.      \"The committee,\" said the report presented at the annual meeting of the  five academies on Thursday, May 2, 1839, \"has paid especial attention to  manuscripts No. 1 and No. 4. Still, it does not feel able to grant  the prize to either of these works, because they do not appear to  be sufficiently elaborated. The committee, which finds in No. 4 some  ingenious analyses, particularly in regard to the mechanism of the  Hebrew language, regrets that the author has resorted to hazardous  conjectures, and has sometimes forgotten the special recommendation of  the committee to pursue the experimental and comparative method.\"      Proudhon remembered this. He attended the lectures of Eugene Burnouf,  and, as soon as he became acquainted with the labors and discoveries of  Bopp and his successors, he definitively abandoned an hypothesis which  had been condemned by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-lettres.  He then sold, for the value of the paper, the remaining copies of the  \"Essay\" published by him in 1837. In 1850, they were still lying in a  grocer's back-shop.    A neighboring publisher then placed the edition on the market, with  the attractive name of Proudhon upon it. A lawsuit ensued, in which  the author was beaten. His enemies, and at that time there were many of  them, would have been glad to have proved him a renegade and a recanter.  Proudhon, in his work on \"Justice,\" gives some interesting details of  this lawsuit.    In possession of the Suard pension, Proudhon took part in the contest  proposed by the Academy of Besancon on the question of the utility  of the celebration of Sunday. His memoir obtained honorable mention,  together with a medal which was awarded him, in open session, on the  24th of August, 1839. The reporter of the committee, the Abbe Doney,  since made Bishop of Montauban, called attention to the unquestionable  superiority of his talent.      \"But,\" says Sainte Beuve, \"he reproached him with having adopted  dangerous theories, and with having touched upon questions of practical  politics and social organization,"]]]
